The regional languages in France were progressively replaced by French from 1789
Only a few are still remaining (mostly those who aren't understandable by a French speaker, like Breton, Basque, Corsican, Alsatian, Francoprovençal etc
) but apparently more than 90% of our regional languages are now dead
You only find them in regional accents
Forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people was a very common thing until the early 2000s. There's now a law requiring consent since 2001, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn forced sterilization still happens
I'd say war against colonised Algeria
It is really a shameful thing involving war crimes, torture, ...
A lot of veterans won't talk about it because of how ashamed they feel
Look it up
France caused the first attack in the history of New Zealand, when it flowed the Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in [1985]
The camps we set up in mainland France during the Algerian war of independence, for 'harkis' (pro-French Algerians)
There were a few, in Rivesaltes, Bias
living conditions were hard, and this event is an important part of the Algerian war
We learn about it in school
Look it up
I mean, you don't become the country with the most battle victory without doing a few shit on the side
We could talk about everything we did during colonisation
We were "only" the second colonial empire behind the British, but we've got nothing to be jealous of
We were as horrible as they were
We could talk about torture and war crimes during the Algeria war, but I always like to remind people that we're the inception of the Vietnam war
Indochina was an old colony of ours composed of nowadays Laos, Cambodia and finally Vietnam
To sum it up quickly, there's been an independence war, we left these country without doing anything to help them organise, and a thing leading to another, Vietnam war kaboom
Murica goes brbr and the French never did anything wrong there AT ALL
Damn just looked it up on google and realised the flag I got as a souvenir from my Vienna trip got the eagle on it
Is that bad
I'm scared I could have offended austrian friends
My father had Kurt Schuschnigg as a professor in university
He used to tell stories about Hitler, and how Hitler wouldn't let anyone smoke
I'd think there were bigger things to worry about, but I guess that was important to him
I'm so glad Occitan was taught in school when I was a kid, and that there were schools where all the classes were given in Occitan
I am so sad I was too dumb to not take any interest in those classes when I was a teenager
I don't realy get why you talk about 1789, it's a weird starting point
The first one to go towards langage uniformisation was François Ier, who did it administratively, so lawer and such
The ones who forced it to the people was the 3rd republic, end of 19th century, 90% of french population was illiterate
Don't get me wrong, yeah the french revolution did some gesture towards it but never realy enforced it significantly
Francoprovençal (or Arpitan) is one of the most endangered language in France
I don't think it will survive
I don't know one people in my region who speaks it
People usually don't even know what is the language originally spoken in the region
Even I, I learnt the existence of Francoprovençal when I was 20 maybe
This is very well documented and R/europe frequently has an attack over it
This ppace will definitely do the exact same
Also a very small minority of french would consider that "dark".
Always nice to hear from the geographically challenged  ;)
(I’m kidding, I do appreciate your addition)
My grand parent had "the potato" at school, if a teacher found a student speaking breton, the teacher would give them the potato, then the student had to find a student that spoke breton and give the potato, at the end of the day, the student who had the potato would get punish
My great grand parent still only spoke breton so my parent do know a bit of breton but mostly some expression, and I know even less than them
It's not a question of tolerance, it's just that at that time our nation had to be united and the first step was to remove the language barrier
Not really, it was more progressive and for me the real turning point to enforce French was during the third Republic in 1881 when Jules Ferry proposed law to make school mandatory and free
From this point the French language everywhere in France take off drastically because this was the only language allowed in schools
I think it's impossible
Apart from an important change in the mentality or a huge increase of regional nationalism those languages will more likely disappear
Young people aren't interested at all in learning their regional language and not a lot of school offer regional language lessons
Except for some maybe that still have a decent of speaker like Breton or Corsican, the others will disappear
J'ai rien compris désolé mais tu peux le dire en français stp
Consent of the person
Until 2001, no consent from the person was required and parents often had full power
The person was left out of it
There's a serious problem with how mental health, intellectual and cognitive disabilities are viewed and treated in France
France is way behind other first world countries in that regard
Every person has a right to make a decision by themselves, even more when safe and non invasive birth control alternatives are possible
You can't deny someone their right to make decisions concerning their own body
The truth is that intellectually disabled people are treated like irresponsible toddlers at best, and like vegetables at worst
In most cases, they're sterilized because their parents view them as perpetual children who don't have a sexuality and shouldn't have one
Many even have been chemically castrated before puberty
What do you call this ? I call this a horrible mutilation
No human being deserves that
Well, forced would be an overstretch
Most UN resolutions regarding decolonization were passed in the 50s and early 60s. Western Sahara was one of the last, with a 2 UN resolutions requiring spain to decoloniza the territory in 1965 and conduct a referendum (I think in 1966)
The Francoist regime didn't want to relinquish control and was still fighting and crushing uprisings by both the Sahrawis and the Moroccan army
It wasn't until 1975 that Spain was seriously considering decolonization, after failing to crush the militia that would form the polisario front
Ironically, it was Morocco that asked the International court to have a say on the matter
It's complicated, but Morocco's government failed to provide concrete evidence to support Morocco's sovereignty before colonization (it's very interesting
At one time, a treaty between Morocco and Spain was discussed, with the Arabic and Spanish versions using different wording that changed the meaning of the text)
Morocco was outraged and held the demonstration famously called the Green March
Spain realized that there is practically no interest for it to be involved, and it signed the Madrid Accords
That's when the shit hit the fan
Yes I got the one headed eagle carrying the tools in his talons
Thanks I had a mini heart attack for a moment :)
Btw awesome country, awesome people, awesome food
Y'all are so chill and nice
Can't wait to go back
Austrian german sounds much softer than high german, that's a cool accent
Hi, are the tools a reference to communism
If so, how do you feel about it
If I recall correctly, that's exactly what it was
We sterilize rapist
Your neighbors south even kill people
>You can't deny someone their right to make decisions concerning their own body
People barely capable to be autonomous should not be in charge of someone with even less autonomy
For the same reason we allow teen pregnancy to be terminated, we allow this form of termination
We have enough people in shitty life conditions already
The one time french and english agree with each other
First, your argument is in favor of birth control, not something as radical as forced sterilization
Second, autonomy varies during someone's life and well compensated disabled people have decent quality of life and many of them have a family they take care of pretty well
Also I've seen far more horrible life conditions due to people who can't access birth control, poverty, dysfunctional families, alcohol and other drugs
Most disabled parents take care of their kids very well, even though it's often harder for them but they still do it
And most of all, it's up to the person to decide
If the person has such a severe mental disability that they shouldn't have kids, they're probably in a hospital room
So there's no need for sterilization or chemical castration
There are far less invasive and safe alternatives in case where controlling hormonal cycles is absolutely necessary
For less severe cases, every person has the right to a sex life
It's  ignorant to assume they can't or won't have one
Spain is currently disliked by Moroccans not exactly for the Western Sahara conflict (the blame is put more on Algeria)
It is disliked because Spain still controls Ceuta and Mellila, as well as a bunch of islands off the coast of Morocco
And also because of how Spain reacts to trade between Morocco and the EU
Thanks
That’s a very good explanation, sorry for my dumb question (and for not checking at least Wikipedia before asking, I should have)
Thank you for the explanation
Sorry for the dumb question
You missed the point
You claim we should leave it up for people to decide
Well, people in jail do not decide for themselves how they dispose of their body
Considering the "mouvement" you should look at the reality of the movement you are talking about
It only exists in your eco chambers
Because you focus on some random detail of my post, you missed the point
I'm discussing the "dark" morality he tries to picture
There are many cases where people do not have the right to dispose of their body
Prisoners and psychiatric cases for example
It's always in the case of protecting a 3rd party
In this case, the 3rd party is potentially the child
The logic is completely sound for the same reason we jail killers
"Disable" doesn't mean anything
If you harm is cut off, you are technically disable, that doesn't prevent you from being perfectly capable
I'm not discussing that
If you are incapable to be autonomous, be it because you're are mentally retarded or highly handicapped, you should not be in charge of a kid and put extra burden on the person taking care of you
>If the person has such a severe mental disability that they shouldn't have kids, they're probably in a hospital room
You have no idea lmao
If you don't get the word "disabled", I'm not here to teach you English
Also there are many disability types : motor, sensory, psychiatric, cognitive, and intellectual, which can be combined
This is intellectual disability I'm talking about and it doesn't necessarily prevent from taking care of a family
It's on a case-by-case basis, and it's also something that needs to be discussed with the concerned person if they experience difficulties
You can't judge someone's capacity to do it without actual knowledge of their difficulties and situation
Also simple birth control is usually preferred, with consented sterilization as a last resort
Forced sterilization goes against human rights and that's precisely why it's now a crime
Most of them actually do have a sex life at some point and they know far more things about sex than you think
Also parents in many cases tend to infantilize their child
Mentally disabled children are statistically the most abused children and this keeps going well into adulthood
Also sterilization is never a first intent birth control and there's no need to use it on someone who refuses to consent to it
You really need to read and learn more about disability and disability rights, because you're obviously one of those people who treat mentally disabled people like children
They're adults and they deserve respect
I don't understand what you're saying
When you're talking about Gibraltar, whose claim to it are you talking about
Morocco's?
If you're talking about Ceuta, its conquest was done in 1415 by Portugal (less than 700 years), and before that it was part of the Marinid sultanate
It was then transferred to the Spanish rule in 1668 by the Treaty of Lisbon
There was no "Moroccan kingdom" then in the same sense that almost every country existing today wasn't what it is now
Spain certainly didn't exist 700 years ago in the technical sense
Anyway, I wasn't even giving arguments
I was saying what people think
A criminal is a person with undesirable trait
Alsox over 60% of the world population lives under death penalty
I think you watch the western world and do not grasp how little we represent
We are not even a billion and a world reaching 8 ones
Forcibly sterilize disabled or taking away the baby at birth is basically the same for the disabled
At the end, they have no kids
It is even worse because they got the struggle and risk of pregnancy and none of the benefits
A push for birth control is just that, a push
If they still want a kid, it will be taken away anyway
The sterilization (or absense of kid ) is the finality in all cases
Also on the jail part, we are very different than North America and we see by your stance USA leaking on you
In europe, The justice system is NEVER a retribution
You dont jail people for what they did
You jail people to make sure they are not a danger to society
If you give a 20 years sentence but by 10 you are certain he wont be a problem he will be out
We are not discussing sterilization of people for the way they are born
We are talking about preventing selfish and dependent people to inflict a life of misery to a potential person that will be a burden on people others than those supposedly responsible of them
You can judge the ability of someone to take care of a child by observing how they take care of themselves
While you can't prevent consenting people from having a kid, you can take the kids away as soon as you are judge incapable to guarantee its safety and basic education (social service are here for that)
Force sterelization is used on people who do not have the mental capacity to control and restrain their sex drive
So the Human right part is just made up
Concerning the "disabled" part, you basically just repeated what I just say
I don't think you have anything to teach anyway
So basically, there's only a need to take a child away if the parents have proven they're experiencing difficulties with the kid
Which in itself has nothing to do with disability or forced sterilization
&#x200B;
>Force sterelization is used on people who do not have the mental  capacity to control and restrain their sex drive
So the Human right  part is just made up
What you're describing here is a pervert
Most intellectually disabled people have no difficulties restraining their sex drive in society just like everyone else
And yes, obviously I need to teach you basics about disabilities as you can't even make the difference between intellectually disabled people and dangerous perverts who need psychiatric hospitalization
It's not compassion
I know them personally, I live with them every day, I even worked with them
I'm even a disabled person myself
I'm in a disability rights association
Attitudes like yours pretend to do these things as kindness but it's actually condescending
And forced surgery destroys lives
Human lives who want a sexuality and a family
They're people just like you and they deserve to be treated as equals
If you're talking only about extremely severely disabled people, they're almost all hospitalized
So they don't need birth control anyway
In case they have hormonal problems, there are treatments for that and sterilization is not just unethical, it's also simply unnecessarily invasive
Most oral treatments can be delivered through IV or simple injections
And it's safe and reversible
My post wasn't talking about extreme cases like vegetative state anyway
I was talking about disabilities such as Down syndrome, cranial trauma and autism
These are the people who have been forcibly sterilized
People who can have a healthy sex life, who did not want to be sterilized and who fully know what was done to them against their will
Sterilization itself doesn't get rid of hormones at all because you don't remove gonads
If gonads are removed, there are some serious side effects, so that's almost never done, and you don't want something irreversible and such an invasive method
In case there are hormonal problems, there are hormonal treatments that can be given orally or through IV
And it's up to the doctors to choose to give them as an appropriate treatment
Yes, I wish the law would be more compassionate to people in vegetative state, terminal disease and extreme suffering
But in a traditionally Catholic country, I don't think progress will be made any time soon
I totally agree with you
I've never seen anyone wanting to allow euthanasia for everyone in real though
I wonder if this is a Reddit thing

Not surprised but still disappointed
I was in London last week, I had the same conversation with a journalist/editor from Scotland
I was saying the same thing as you but he told me that first, Johnson is not that stupid and he will make everything to push back a possible Indy ref, moreover he told me that if a referendum was happening now, Sturgeon would lose it, second, he probably won’t last long as a PM
So I was really confused between your point that I see a lot going around and what he told me (he is probably biased of course, this was not a professional conversation)
What do British people thinks about this ? I would really enjoy a conversation about these two opinions
All of the interviews of BoJo are unreal, as in, surreal
I'm still in shock how he was the mayor of London for TWO TERMS
He's too much like Trump and I don't look forward to the days of his name being plastered everywhere .

I genuinely laughed at that
That's a great story, thanks for sharing it
Extreme poverty in France looks like that: [
It is a huge majority of non-French people, usually from countries like Syria or from Romania
There is also extreme poverty within new African migrants, but they usually have their own family/village/regional networks in France that take them in charge, not necessarily under the best conditions but they are not as visible as Roms and warzone migrants
Comment approved
I would just like to mention that not all Romanians are Roms
It is a specific community with a specific way of living
Yes
And it’s currently fucking up my exams
Yet here I am, reading English on Reddit
Just how stupid am I???
Opposite problem: I'm an Anglophone who has lived in France now for seven years
French grammar style has begun to creep into my English
Yes because of differences such as "language" and "langage" or "literally" vs "littéralement" (notice the double letters are not the same)
Leaving with a foreigner and working for an international corporation all in english ... i must admit that my written french requires more auto correct than before
Happened to me some years ago after a long stay in Ireland
At the arrival in France I purchased my train ticket in English at the train station, then for several days I talked to the cashier in English at the supermarket
It took me more than a week to think in French all the time
The same thing happened when I came back from a summer holiday in Québec
I spoke québécois longer than I expected back in Paris
Same for me, I forget the proper French words because I tend to use the English words so much that when I speak in French I just throw them in the conversation
Same, and with German too
A nightmare
The French accent in general, whether it's mine or someone else's, is pretty much torture to my ears
I hate it
I've some of the heaviest french accent ever
Everytime i talk to an american, he burst out in laugh then tell me girls are going to love me
So it's fine i guess ?
I've worked hard on getting rid of my French accent (by practicing an RP accent, basically), now people can tell I'm not a native speaker but can't quite place me
I don't think I'll bother going further than that : I feel that acquiring one particular accent would be a sort of statement that I don't want to make
Also, when I get overly excited while speaking English, the accents I've studied blend together, and I switch accents from one word to the next, which I've been told is the funniest thing, and I don't want to lose that
I don't, I feel stupid
My mind knows how to pronounce the word correctly but my mouth is like "flekzknfn". And I don't have a heavy one
Many french people are ashamed to speak english because here in english class, we almost never speak, and nothing is made (it's the opposite) to make us feel confident
I absolutely don't care but a LOT of people tell me it's sexy
I don't get it but guess I'll take it
The French accent I absolutely hate
It sounds awful to me
Mine is light enough that people mistake it for other accents, so I'm happy about that
I might be alone here but I like mine
I have worked on it, not to sound native but to be as understandable as possible, which is I think the most important part when learning a language
I'm pretty sure no one likes their own accent when speaking a different language
It is similar in France, lots of people are shy about speaking English because they think the accent sounds stupid
This is most likely a result of the French education system which is not great when it comes to foreign languages
While English is taught at an early age, by the time you graduate high school, students are not equal in their skills
Some can speak fluently with a British accent, others can't align 3 words
I started learning English 25 years ago and have been using English professionally for the past 15 and living in an English speaking country for 10
I still have a strong accent and people often ask me to repeat
In my neck of the woods, I even had people answer me in French
I don't really care, this accent is not going away
The only thing I can do is to go to a speech therapist to learn how to pronounce *th*.
I've always heard that English speakers absolutely love the French accent but almost every French people I've met feel uneasy when they speak English because of it
Plus, I was also told at school that having an accent might sometimes make you hard to understand or lead to confusions (we don't have long sounds in French so there might confusions between  ship/sheep, beach/bitch etc)
I don't. I've worked very hard to try and get as close as possible to a perfect English accent, a pointless task I know, because it makes me ashamed when people make fun of me for it
It’s shit , but I started to learn English 4 years ago in 5th grade , so I think I have the time to make it better !
I sincerely dislike the French accent, I think it sounds like a speech impediment
I worked very hard to get rid of it and to have a more standard southern British accent, I think it gives me a lot more credibility than the French accent
My favourite English accents are Dutch, German and Swedish I just like the way they pronounce things, I find it adorable
In General I do not like my French accent
It's cool as an ice breaker from time to time but in professional environment I would rather blend in with my peers
However I remember one specific time I was happy about my accent: I was playing cards against humanity with my suitemates in the USA and I had to read the card:
"***But before I kill you, Mr
Bond, I must show you\_\_\_\_\_\_"***
Everybody laughed and said my accent was perfect to read this card and the answers
My personal accent is different from the typical French accent
And I hate it that I can’t pronounce English Rs correctly in several words
Yes
My secret ? I just keep an huge french accent when talking english
It's funny how much it's bed lmao
I like the German accent a lot, actually
It's very soft and ever so slightly high pitched
The comedy German accent you hear in movies and on TV sounds awful, but it is not at all what the actual accent sounds like in the real world
I am exactly like you, except I'm French
I'm embarassed by my accent
And the occasions to speak English are very rare
What does a strong Danish accent sound like in English
The only one I've ever heard is from South Park where the hunt internet trolls, but I doubt that's very accurate
The only Danish actor I know of (Nickolaj Coster Waldau) can pass as a native English speaker easily
Oh god, my accent is absolutely terrible
And I hate it when people mention it after me speaking just 3 words
And I did work 6 month in Denmark, with the working language being English
People saying "french accent is cute" never heard me speaking :/
There's about 4 million English accents, so it'd be quite interesting to hear what yours is like and how you feel about it
Man our linguistic politics sucks *so much* it is tiring at time to argue with people even when you've got arguments and science on your side
Not give a fuck about what anyone thinks (very hard to do I'll admit) and try to do your best
I've never been mocked for having a good English accent, ever
On the contrary
Speak faster
Hahaha I have a Swiss uncle and I don't notice it that much now, but it's less noticeable than the Belgian one
Why do you want to get rid of it
It's not attractive when you can't get what I'm trying to say x)
I still remember when I wanted to say "happiness", and everybody around a table looked at me weirdly
They all though I said "a penis", which didn't fit in the conversation ...
Trust me, among french, my accent is VERY thick
It's a tad difficult to explain, especially in English
But basically we can sum it up to some major points/issues:
First, there's a fear of evolution, or some sort of puritanism in our language
People have a tough time understanding that French is a LIVING language and that it is normal that it is still evolving
Everytime someone proposed a reform of the language or its spelling, every person who can speak went mad because "WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE, IT'S NOT EVOLUTION, IT'S DOWNVOLUTION, MOLIERE WOULD ROLL IN HIS GRAVE (that's a French idiom) HOW CAN YOU, HOW DARE YOU". Except that most of the time none of these people have any basic linguistic knowledge and shit on things they don't know
L'académie Française doesn't help either
It's a bunch of grumpy white old dudes with - again - no linguistic background that think they are the ones saying how the language is supposed to be spoken/written
BUT:
1/ you can't tell people *how* to speak
Again, living language, what is spoken becomes the new rule etc
2/ they have no official power endorsing this
Like, they litteraly have no official powers nor duties
All they are supposed to do is edit a dictionary, which they haven't done for nearly a century now
Then, we basically killed our regional languages
Our relationship towards our language is deeply linked to what we call "le roman national", which means the national novel
Basically it is a romanticise history of our nation, mostly false and full of symbolism etc
And the langue is one of its core
French is the only official language of our country
One Langue for one people
It was thought that we wouldn't feel as one of there was many different languages and that people wouldn't feel United and there wouldn't be such a strong patriotism
I'm making short cuts but you have the idea
The result of this thinking is us abandoning the teaching and speaking of regional languages such as Breton, Corse, Occitan etc
People who were speaking it where shame for it at school and in there day to day life
Therefore they stopped speaking it and only used French
Also you couldn't learn it in school, and you still can't most of the time
If you want to, you gotta go to some specific organisation and it's a real pain in the ass
And with all that, French people still have a weird relationship with the French language
It is one of the only language where you'll see native speaker ALWAYS make remarks to other native speakers because what they said was wrong/weird etc
It's also a difficult language to learn because, whereas in English if you do some mistakes, nobody will bat an eye and everyone will be "completely understandable, you're learning, have a good day", French people will *always* emphasise on your mistakes etc
Also most of French do not like it when tourist can't speak a word of French
But, like, man THEY'RE FUCKING DUTCH OF COURSE THEY DON'T SPEAK FRENCH YOU INSUFFERABLE CUNT
Sorry, my own people trigger me a bit
If you can speak French I can't recommend you Linguisticae's YouTube channel enough
If you don't speak french, I think there are English subs :D
(It's already a pretty long post and it is still just a summary of numerous problem)
Edit: I just saw that I didn't answered your question about accent
Yes and no
As every country comes stereotypes depending on where you live
So someone coming from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be seen as someone fucking his sister
So if you have this accent you can be mocked some time
Southern accent are also mocked sometimes as the accent toulousain
But it's more of a job problem
If you wanna be a journalist and work in TV or Radio, you'll have to change your accent to a Parisian one
It is seen as the default accent, and you just won't find the work you want if you're adamant at keeping your native accent
They are seen as less professional, more rednecky in a way
But in the same time people with strong and recognisable accent are proud of them
Don't ever ask someone from Marseille to drop their accent
You'll most likely end with an AK-47 aimed at you
Edit 2: if [that's] not the best exemple of how defensive some can feel towards our language
Haha, true
Well, I did an internship abroad, and the company put all of their intern (very international community) in the same group of flat
So I had friends from everywhere, it was nice
I had no trouble to get everyone when they spoke English EXCEPT for the British x)
The hardest thing when I speak with foreigners, is for them to actually get my name right
It's frustrating, because my name is overly simple
It's "Loïc" (basically, you have to pronounce every letters
You see the word LOgarithmIC ? Well, you take the 2 first letters, the 2 last letter, and you're good)
For some reason, people hear "louich", and they do not now that name, so they go with "Luigi" somehow
It is a true mystery to me x)
> I hope it survives
Oh my sweet summer child, who are you, thee that are so pure of heart
> This change is seen as good in France
Well, not by our linguists
Scientists, because yes my fellow Frenchmen who might read this comment, linguistic is a science, are making the same analysis, and they don't think it is a good thing
But Jean-Pierre who's always been told that speaking a "proper" French is speaking it this way and not that way, and that French should never change ever again won't hear it the same way
People need to understand that a language that does not evolve anymore is a dead one
And no, Molière won't be pissed because we're changing our language, just because he himself was not speaking the same French as we do
For fuck sake is it this complicated to understand
I mean, have you seen the screen I've linked
It is frightening to see such behaviour in 2020
We sanctify our language, and we make it something it isn't.
I would say "low-ick", but I wouldn't mind the other one
I think I will reuse that to explain how to pronounce my name x)
Well, with colleagues, they usually finish by getting it right
But you know, each time I meet new people, I have to explain again
And sometimes I just give up (I'm looking at you, Starbucks)
Apple, like many other companies applies the 1$ = 1£ exchange rate ... Apple becomes too expensive
Also apple in the last 4 years is just following the trend not being a pacesetter anymore, so the extra cost becomes less and less acceptable
The fact that Whatsapp is also now heavilly used makes that you can use what you want
&#x200B;
Finally, yes Android is less polished than IOS, but it's still quite good for the price and more advanced (for geeks)
A bit late but I didn't see lots of comments mentionning one point: phones are more expensive in Europe than in the US
When you take into consideration conversion rates, you can add roughly 15% of the price to buy the same phone in Europe because of VAT
As a result, iPhone and top Android phones are even more overpriced for the value and people tend to buy more affordable phones
So more Android phones are being sold as before the new iPhone SE Apple wasn't selling anything in the "cheaper" market segments
Well here iPhones are viewed negatively, at least in my circles
It cost way too much without anything more than another brand
Phones like Google Pixels and OnePlus are getting more and more popular, alongside Huawei
The only people I see with iPhones are either older or see it as a status thing because they are into the whole American Dream from reality TV
I agree at 100% and it always bothers me when I see overpriced simple things even though you can have the same one for ⅛ of the price like Balenciaga or Louis Vuitton
Marseille could be one of the most beautiful coast cities of Europe, and home to the most beautiful beaches in France and instead it's a trash covered ,drug infested criminal playground that gets worse and worse every year
Marseille I would say, it smells bad, it is reputed for its criminality, they sometimes have whole building randomly collapsing out of disrepair and they have had political corruption problems for as long as I remember
Marseille definitely but the whole of Pas de Calais as well
Paris, no contest
The highest density of assholes par m2
And I live near Paris
I honestly think Paris
It's supposed to be our capital city, a city of love
but it just stinks like pee and pollution
1- North Marseilles, North & South west Paris suburbs
Beside the obvious ugliness of the quick & cheaply made buildings, those cities are the physical representation of Post colonialist France
They are where we parked to die those we used and abused to rebuilt our country
Now they serve as scapegoat by far right (all over the world) to label and blame Muslim as "trouble". It is to me the biggest failure of our last 50 years
2 - Béziers, Hayange, Fréjus, Hénin-Beaumont
Those city elected Far right politicien
They are a tumor
3 - Paris for many reasons but mainly losing it's soul
4 - All new cities built on the American model
Made for car, not people
Ok, I'm almost a month late know but seeing all my fellow frog talk about Marseille made me think of somewhere way worse in my opinion
Behold: the wet and gloomy grey Belfort
It north-east, and the only thing to save is their choucroute
It's grey as fuck, it's cold as hell (pun intended) the rain would make London blush, AND CAN WE TAKE JUST A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THEIR FUCKING ACCENT
Also it's a bastion for the FN and the far right in general
Nothing to save there
Franchement j’aurais d’abord pensé à Charleville-Meziere
Mais est-ce que c’est une ville (nombre d’habitants) ?
To be fair, the drug scene isn't worst than other big cities, it's just that the media only talk about Marseille
Paris is just the same, Givors in a much smaller way is the same etc
But for a reason we only ever hear a thing about Marseille
And it saddens me because it's still a great city
Yeah it's full of trash, but Paris smell of piss
If you look at the city from the Bonne Mère the city is still beautiful
People are cheerful and helpful
To be frank, I would have said Marseille too because it's the general consensus, but I think it's a real shame the way people see the city
Yeah Blackpool
Went there once when I was studying in  England because a friend said it was ugly so as students from abroad we had to go and check
It's ugly
Have you heard about Roubaix ? (I'm from there )
Charleville-Meziere ? If there are enough inhabitants here to call it a city
Let's not forget Saint Etienne
Serbia isn't the poorest country in Europe though
It’s actually a nice city to visit, worth the trip I’d say (but I’m biased)
He's probably from Paris, that's why he chooses Marseille
Everyone else hate Paris more
This a legit opinion and it’s probably pretty close
We should hire one of these guys with highly trained noses that work for perfume manufacturers to decide once and for all
Yeah of course but it’s not really known well enough to be the city France is most ashamed of
They're the Americans of France, to sum it up shortly
And women don't exist ?
The thing is, no one really hate Paris, but the parisians
Fake news, we live on a cylinder
My family is there, though my parents relocated when I was young
Are you
I should actually have known that
Like
It’s written just beside your name
Please act as if you didn’t know I’m dumb
There is no excuse because being late is normal and almost required
If you are really late you incriminate the peripherical road traffic
Strikes
"I couldn't go through this road because of a strike, I was stuck for x amount of time, all the trains were stuck at the train station
" It's not super common, but if there's a strike where you live here's your chance to use it
Traffic jam or accident
Because my city has accidents every day on the freeway
If you live in Paris I guess the usual jokes about la RATP (Paris underground and suburban train) which are either late or in strikes
Otherwise we do not have common excuses
The classic "panne de réveil", which means "alarm clock failure" --> you basically overslept
No excuse because it's even more polite to come a bit late that punctually
And if I'm very late, I say there was a demonstration blocking the road
This, the same is true for Paris
There are some subway lines that are just known for always having problems, just say that it was the 13rd, everybody will understand
If you’re on time, you’ll just be sitting there waiting for everyone else
Because when there's a lot of cars they can't follow the morotbike, but trust me, sometimes you see the morotbike and then a few seconds later you see cops morotbikes and everybody in their car claps in a "cheh" vibe
Lmao do you think he knows what "cheh" means ?
EDIT : For those wondering, "cheh" is an Arabic word that we use a lot in France
It means : "You deserved it
And not only I do not feel empathy for you, I'm also delighted seeing you get what you deserve
Ain't sure of that lol
Doesn’t matter, is on strike anyways
Going by stereotype, we'd be the sales rep
of the company
Because we're just so much better than anyone else (oh man, I hated writing this being French and working in sales
Otherwise probably in administration, asking you for some paperwork, and some more without ever looking at it and telling you you filled it wrong anyway
We’re the union leader
The guy with high responsibilities who hate his Boss
On strike or on smoking break, talking loudly and awkwardly to the pretty and shy Swedish supervisor who'd be looking for a polite way to tell us to fuck off
Three months or one, depending if you're management or not
That's a good idea, spokes person, PR Manager, sounds great too
You can't fire us, we've passed our trial period
We protest instead
I speak english like an american but use British spelling
I was always influenced by American language and culture so I knew English even before started going school so I barely learned it in school so I am all american words I guess
Can't, I sound like a douchebag from L.A :( (/s)
I've seen too much american tv
...This is honestly a good representation of how I speak english
I am never getting out of my house ever again now
I was a 17yo french guy visiting California, I was mostly annoyed by how much people wanted to hug for no reason
I was in San Francisco with my family a few years ago
At some point we stopped in a Hard Rock Cafe and I ordered what I thought would be a small brownie, and I got a probably a dozen of brownies mashed into the biggest cup I’ve ever seen, along with a crap load of ice cream and chocolate on top; even by sharing it with everyone we didn’t finished it, and it was the same everywhere
The size of the meals over there is ridiculous
Also the distance you can travel before finding any sign of life freaked me out a bit at first
The weirdest thing for me were houses
They were, like huge, even in middle class people, with a huge front yard no one used but had to be perfect and tiny tiny backyard for the family
It was just a waste of space for me: you buy a land and use only a small part on it
Why a so big front yard
Also, the lack of privacy, most houses didn't have a fency around their land, you wouldn't see were your land stop and where the neighbours one start and everyone could see in your yard
Then I realized that most american almost spend no time outside, except maybe if they have kids
The last thing were the huge and sometime double
) garage, here there is only one garage (or even none) and it's on the side, a bit hidden, on many american houses it's in the front and the first/only thing you see, wich is ugly
When I was there I was like "aww this house is beautiful
" and they were all like "eww it's old
" in front of olders building
It seams in the US, old is NOT a compliment for architecture
In French you’d say « Monsieur » (sir), « Madame » (mrs), you’d never ever call them by their name !
That's the cultural shock, I don't feel better when strangers hug me
The state  I was were not really hot to be honest, it's was a nice day
But most of the time, when they went outside for "a walk" they were actually going to the mall, or sport events, or shopping or restaurant
They really used they garden, no matter the season, not just the family I was with, but all their friends/neigbours to
Yeah, but I find it less oppressive/invasive to kiss cheek people than to hug them :)
Cheek kisses are pretty depersonalized in France, it's a bit weird when you think about it
I personally find them very awkward unless if it's with good friends, as a genuine mark of appreciation rather than just as a mechanical greeting
Same as with hugs
The governement trashing our Work code in France
Using the coronavirus crisis they failed to prepare and face correctly to take workers rights away and bringing us closer to a police state
Our government didnt do a very great job so far, so the opposition is having a field day because, of course, they would have been way better at protecting the country against the virus
Terrorist attack
Yup and the media just ignores it
That's awful gosh
Have you seen anything about Hungary lately ?
That kind of sums it up
Amazon is closing its warehouses following a justice decision: they were told to limit their activity to essentials only, didn't, put their employees at risk, and were put in front of a judge by a union
The warehouses are closed for 5 days, in order to clean them and put sanitary measures in place
The thread on r/worldnews was bad enough, with people only reading the headline and missing the point, please don't let this nonsense spread it elsewhere
I did
That's horrible
The new "laws" are to answer the emergency that is the Covid-19
Last time we has emergency laws were to answer to terrorist attacks and they then became part of the normal laws even in non-emergency times
So I'd say pretty likely unfortunately
At the moment, it'd centrist globalists but 2022 should decide it
France may actually go far right (Front National which became Rassemblement National has been the first or second biggest party in every national election for the last 19 years
) but I do feel a switch to the left in the population
Will it remain until the election
I'm not sure
Will people realize that what they advocate for has been defended by the far left for years
I unfortunately don't think so
This has more to do with social issues here, so no worries about WW3
(or we won't be the ones responsible)
That one's a minor fo sho'.
Napoléon please come back
Just another change in regime
Medieval edition:
Cunégonde, Radegonde, Brunehilde for women, Odilon, Odo, Aldéric, Raymond, Raoul, Anne (now a women’s name
) for men
20th century edition:
Odile, Jacqueline, Suzanne, Nicole, Chantal for women
Gilbert, Marcel, Gaspard, Denis, André for men
my cast: Aristide (m) and Louison (f)
probably Jean-Jacques, like I don’t know anyone who’s called Jean-Jacques under 65yo
Geertruida ? we have Gertrude in French, and it sounds reeeeally old too
You forgot Godefroy in the medieval edition
That's really funny because in France, double first names are generally seen as very "bourgeois". The complete opposite
Wow that’s interesting
Anne is absolutely never used for men here anymore, and most people don’t even know it used to be a gender neutral name
Yes i have noticed that it comes up in shows sometimes
I noticed they also use those names in the USA, like Simone
It sounds old-fashioned for us
So apparently you guys copied us, but a bit later
True
For full medieval saga effect, add Chrétien, Lancelot, Perceval, Ysengrin, Iseult, Isabeau
Honestly they don't have to be dying out; name your kid this, suggest it as a name, use it for a book character; we can influence society
*Some* first names are seen as bourgeois, but not nearly all of them
The only example I ever saw is Anne de Montmorency
Took them long enough
Feels like right now the world is a big cigarette smoker and now that we're coughing blood, after multiples warnings from our GP, only now we're thinking "Hey perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea to quit cigarette".
This is not to them to decide what countries should do
They wants to decarbonyze european industries but EU have no inudstries
Countries have industries, so they decide for us
When I'm binge watching a show, it's often in the original language so, often English
One day I downloaded the wrong file so the new season was in French and I couldn't understand it at first
It only takes a few seconds to realize that I can in fact understand it perfectly but that's super weird
Yes, I'm not the only one ! Sometimes when I read something I don't even remember if it was in French or English because at some point it made no difference to me
For a while, I even wrote a word in English instead of French and didn't notice until much later
Thanks I forgot the word turnout in French now
I think “我还学中文” (I'm also learning Chinese) would sound more natural  (am a native speaker)
Ah yes we say "taux de participation" in french, no wonder I forgot it
No problem :)
We are the country with [the most timezones in the world] (12), more than Russia and the US (11)
It is also always daytime somewhere in the country, the only or other country for which this is true is the UK
Our longest land border is with Brazil (730km), longer than our border with Spain (623km), even with Andorra included (680km)
In 1801, Napoleon passed a [law on religion] ("Le Concordat") which among other things meant that bishops were appointed by the state
When in 1905, the law on the separation of church and state was passed and officially abolished the Concordat, it did not apply to Alsace-Moselle which had been annexed by Germany in 1870
When the territory was returned in 1919 it was still, and is still to this day under the Concordat
That means the the french president is still the one appointing catholic bishops in Alsace, even today
Our only land border with the Netherlands is in the Carribean, on the island of [Saint Martin/Sint Maarten] France owns the north, while the Netherlands own the south
[Pheasant Island] is an island on a river on the French-Spanish border which changes country every 6 months
It is currently Spanish and will become french on August 1st
France is the country with the most different time zones on earth and is present in every ocean and continent on earth thanks to its islands and regions overseas called DOMTOM (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic, Indian Sea, Oceania, etc
France has the second biggest network of embassies on earth right after
America
France is the most touristic country on earth
In fact, there are more people visiting France every year than people actually living in the country (90 millions tourists, 67 millions inhabitants)
France shares a border with Brasilia
How
Thanks to Guadalupe
More than 20% of the French population is located in one single place which doesn't even represent 10%  of the total French area (Ile-de-France / Paris, which make this region one of the most dense populated region in Europe)
BONUS 6 : We don't wear caps and walk around with our baguette under the arm when we wake up in the morning :)
BONUS 7 : Our country is one of the most rural countries in Europe
In fact, a big part of the French population is located in Paris (result of a thousand year old centralisation in France)
The other people are whether living in the other smaller cities, or in one of the 36 000 villages from our country side
Super interesting thanks !
Wait that highest elevation point
does it mean the country is flat and cycling is easier
Thank you for that one then
I grew up there and luxemburgish is german mixed with french with some dutch sprinkled on top just for taste
The capital is full of remnants of that fortress, awesome to visit and chill around with friends in the spring and summer !
In France this kind of taxes isn't surprising either
I must ride bike there and bother unsuspecting countryside folks into housing me for a night
Would it work
I mean is that kind of hospitality common
I'd love an immersive stay throughout the country
All right thanks !
Wow it appears we have the same dumbfucks
Oh yes ! The great conspiracy by the evil LGBT lobbies to turn all our poor innocent children gay ! The reason why La Manif Pour Tous started
They're all obsessed with those "gender theory" stories
And sex ed books too
Sex ed books are meant to make innocent children gay !
And so many people on Reddit think Europe is some sort of progressive heaven
LOL no
Same thing
This is the reason why assisted suicide is still illegal in France
Catholic lobbyists are powerful in a country that's supposed to be unaffiliated to any religion
The same Catholic lobbyists have been fighting hard against stem cell research as well
Yeah they should all agree on one thing, it gets confusing, am I living in the 4th Reich or in the EUSSR ?
Some sentences stay the same
Maybe I nt'should not have much oversimplify
Perfect
I you love all, my friends European
Maybe that sometimes it would look weird but the structure of sentence French is pretty similar to the structure of sentence English
The two languages have many of things in common
I will do of my best to speak clearly
I hope that the people in this subreddit me understand
Hello , i'm called RonronFaitCaca and my account reddit has 1 year (old) . I you wish a good day
It’s same in French
Almost
I just had to remove the “the”.
We do speak not good English in France although, this is a bit the shame
Now the thing funny is to guess if the Belgians translate from the French or from the Flemish :D
It (would) have been nice if we could all translate a sentence of example, so we can compare the different languages
&#x200B;
Actually "It would have been" translates to "Ça aurait été", so a word disappear here
Not much difference for the second part of the sentence, except the "of" which would translate to "d' " (une phrase d'exemple)
The spanish is more easy and one time that you have already learned the spanish, thé french becomes more easy
> in Romance languages, it comes after
This is not always the case, in French the adjectives can be before and after
If they are "completing" a noun they are before, for example *Un nouveau livre*-> A new book
It can even change the meaning of the sentence *un sacré livre / un livre sacré* (a great book / a holy book)
It depend, if I write like I speak in French it can quickly be messy
Majdnem mindent értettem
Yes, I'm tired of shady governments using big sports events to redeem themselves
And the French football team has a habit to botch one out of every two worldcup, so if we can prevent that it would be great
A boycott would be the right thing to do
But it's pretty unlikely that some teams or company is going to do it on a significant level
However the most hurtful boycott of them all would be if viewers don't watch those games
institutions, corporations, advertisers,... Are still going to spend their money like everything in the world is going well
No one is more relevant than human beings to worry about human rights
An online awareness effort during the WC will definitely help
Yeah, I think we can use your post as a template for more or less every single country
Fucking hell that's depressing
Honestly, the FIFA bribes I don't particularly care about
It's obviously not good, but I just accept that it happens for every World Cup attribution and always has
It should still stop, but it's not something that I feel strongly enough to boycott
&#x200B;
The human rights situation and the conditions in which the infrastructure was built is 100% enough to justify a boycott though
Korea 2002
What a sweet memory
Isn’t there a law in France which prevents boycott based on a state’s politics
(Granted, human rights should not be politics, but I’m not sure we would even be able to boycott it if we’re to be coherent
Hi, born in 1999 here, what happened in 2002
I don't think there's such laws
For the 1980 Olympics in Moscow a lot of nations boycotted the event to protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the French government didn't want to interfere and let the French National Olympic Committee decide
Several federations, Horse Riding, Shooting and Sailing Federations decided to not participate
It was also decided that the French Flag and anthem wouldn't be used, the athlete were there but France wasn't.
There was a similar debate for the boycott of 2008 Olympics in Beijing because of the Chinese occupation of Tibet, Jack Lang for instance was in favor of a complete boycott
More recently Daniel Cohn-Bendit called for a boycott of the 2018 Football World Cup in Russia and there was some talks to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in China
2002 was a disaster : 2 defeats (opening game against Senegal and Denmark) and a draw (Uruguay) with 0 goal, despite having in the team the best scorers for english (Henry), italian (Trezeguet) and french (Cissé) championships
They hit the post 5 times
Zidane was injured a few days before the competition during a useless game against Korea and wasn't able to play the first 2 games
Few months before, Pirès, a very important player in the team was badly injured
You add to this some arrogance (Adidas started to run adds with a 2nd star, players were everywere in the media), impreparation (players were exhausted by the regular season) and lack of games against strong teams
Indeed, as titleholder, France was automatically qualified and only played friendly games during 2 years against weak teams
For example, they lost against Chile, had a draw against Australia and lost to Belgium
[This is what I’m talking about] though I’m not sure it can be used in sports
Oh putain
[The European Court of Human Right actually went against the cassation judgement]
But it's an interesting case-law that could have been applied in this context
On est passés très vite de "On est les champions" à "On est dans l'avion".
I’m glad, actually
Thanks for the info
Interesting indeed, too bad I know so little about law
C'est quand même mieux que "On est dans le bus".
Probably peak “I’m not racist but
”, Nadine Morano once “my best friend is more black than an Arab”
Sibeth Ndiaye, french gouvernement spoke persons, said during this very pandemic “some people don’t know how to put a mask on, I don’t know how to put a mask on”.
That’s just one of many ...
"We couldn't have seen coming nor prevented this crisis" - Our President, after three months of the start of the COVID propagation, and years of protest by the nurses and doctors about the unpreparation of the hospitals because of the lack of government support, and the years of warning by everyone of the ageing population of doctors in rural areas
"Mourir, c'est pas facile" (Dying ain't easy), President in office Nicolas Sarkozy during his speech for the new year's wishes to the national medical personnel
Nicolas Sarkozy said something like " dying is not easy"
But

neutrinos notoriously interact very little with matter
Literally billions of billions of them pass through the earth every second
They might be the **only** thing in the universe that wouldn't require any infrastructure if you wanted to send some from one place to another (apart from the emitters and receivers, that is)
As far as I remember Suski was the one member of the comission who never heard of Catherine the Great and didn’t understand the man was purposefully making him look like an idiot
His fellow comission members, especially Małgorzata Wassermann were trying so hard not to outright laugh at him
There was also the one time when Suski said in an TV interview that Polish people like to go to Egypt /Tunisia for the holidays, so an airport south of Warsaw would be good for them
And yes, he meant the one and only AIRLINE HUB of Radom
Haaaa Nadine
Sibeth outright said “I will lie for Macron”. It doesn’t get much worse than that
Calling himself a dick, I burst out laughing
Why
What was he trying to say, for any of those
That guy has more than one family
Protests are banned
Can't protest to protest against the protest ban
Why live
Closing bakeries
I need my baguette
Closing the bakeries
And they won't do it because it's considered a bare necessity
Btw I don't know what's worst, that my dad just bought 15 baguettes just in case, or that it was our only panic purchase
Wine shops, bakeries, market's. Basically any place to get food and beverages
Macron speaking like a true socialist, defending the public services and the health workers
No protest, the cafe are closed and so the bakery soon
In France, the public services are the only one working \^\^
[It's in our minds]
And listen to classical music
Nevermind, i tried it once, it's painful and never ending
For real, Macron announced that leaving your home was forbidden and the first thing my father asked was if he can still buys bread every morning
Maybe they realized how this could potentially fuel the illegal market ? This news definitely made street dealers happy
I think you've just been annexed mate
bUT aMenDMeNtS
I don't forget about it because I want to visit
But I forget how far it is
How different from continental Europe it must be (including the UK)
It's like being in a village and there is a guy on his hill far away in the distance
I imagine Iceland as a quiet place where they're minding their own business
Peaceful country, something like that
I wouldn't support it, but wouldn't oppose it either
I would support a big Europe wide high speed rail network
Why wouldn't we after all ? Yet do we have the funds to do it ?
No I wouldn't. High speed rail doesn't even work properly within a country, much less internationally
I don't think I ever traveled internationally on a train
Yeah Hu so about France
We’ve slowly removed the smaller lines for decades now
You basically HAVE to go through Paris and follow the main TGV lines, you can’t really travel around the country by rails
No it's not
Well, unless you like to have your travel canceled because of a strike
There isn't one
I haven't yet seen a rail that is preferable to taking car or plane
I skip to comments from the French, just so I can disagree with them
**Comté ? Really ? How is Roquefort not our best cheese how can you say that ?**
Doesn't mean I don't read the rest though
If there's less than a 100 comments I read everything
Otherwise, just the top ones or my country ones
but I try to read as much as I can
Nah, there aren't many French posters anyway
Depend if I want to answer or not, if I want to answer i'll look for my countrymen in order to not make the same comment, if not, I'll just scroll normally
Usually I try to see if I can find my own country, but it depends on the subject
There, that's the spirit !
Hello br
wait this isn't France
Yes, all the time; either by mail or email
Most of them are made to be provocative tear jerkers, going as far as making the person who read the ad the one responsible for the death of a starving child in a country struck with starvation
It used to make me feel bad, until I discovered how much these NGOs were turning in as profit per year, and their "reserve" money
Yeah, I remember as a kid/teen (kind of stopped watching TV after) in the 90s we had a lot of ads by NGOs about donating money to the poor in Africa
It's a business
I'm not sure that a lot of the donations actually help "poor african kids". I recently spoke with a girl that worked for more than 10 years with charity missions to Africa (from the UN to private charity like Oxfam), and the salary she was getting from those charity was insane, like 30k for a 6 weeks mission
She quitted this job because she said she felt disgusted at some point with how much money was going in those NGOs and how little was actually used to help the poor
Knowing that it makes sense that they make a lot of ads to play on the emotion of people to give money
Showing poor African kids dying of starvation and covered by flies is typical in those ads, and since it's almost all we see from Africa on TV then we're made to think that it's the typical situation there
In France though, we have a lot of people who immigrated from Africa or are descendants of African migrants, so it's almost impossible to have no one in your surroundings/friends who have not been to Africa and will then tell you how life is there in a more realistic way
Kind of true, but right now africa and poor malnurish children, is like 3rd or 4th competing with the swimming immigrant in hijab
- Before that, in number 2, you have néo-nazi eastern country (also named Soroskistan) starting with Austria/Italy and moving east,
- But number 1, is UK and brexit, I'm already stacking equipement for the polish plumbers overthere or else how will the Brit get the water they need for tea that will allow thme to go threw this mess ?
>Whenever I surf the internet, I'm always baffled by the amount of ignorance that exist regarding Ghana and Africa in general
What do you mean ? Is Ghana that different than Norway ? only difference is the specie that eats you alive, polar bear vs lions, no
"Maître d' ". Just, why
How do you even pronounce it in English
That's because it's borrowed from French (the goofy prononciation)
No it's "say-musse"
Hahahaha I always think the person had an accident mid sentence and forgot a word
Stool doesnt mean shit in French
There, just thought you guys needed to know
Not really then
Crèche is before 3yo in France
Then you go to école maternelle
I miss the snowy Winters of before
Now Winters are grey, humid, the ground is mushy, it looks sad
It's like Spring immediately follows Fall
Even now, it should already be freezing at night but night temperatures are like 12°C. That's August night temperatures
I don't mind Christmas stuff in stores though
I like chocolate
I don't know if it's a global trend but here in Paris there are tons of guys between 20 and 30 with Canada Goose heavy parkas as soon as the temps are under 15°. Like they are about to start an expedition to Greenland or Svalbard
In Lisboa ! Wow
I've never been there but given the latitude and the proximity of the ocean, I can't imagine it being cold enough for such protection, even in winter
The elderly are still very resentful against the Germans, but there is a solid Franco-German bond tied after the war so not in the younger generations

In France, I don't know anyone under 50 years old who ever said anything anti-German, I'm not saying they don't exist, but I never met one
Sure, my grand parents generation on the other hand were very anti-German because they lived through WW2
Generally speaking, I think modern French people admire today's Germany because it's a successful country
Ignorant people here love to hate on Germans, kind of on the same level as Englishmen though
I did meet some Germans while partying in Frankfurt, Mannheim and Berlin and they were the nicest and laid back people even after disclosing that I was French
I had such a great time there
In France, Germans are perceived very differently depending on the age of the person you're talking to
I'd say that people who were born well after the end of WW2 and did not witness its impact firsthand are generally neutral towards Germans
The younger the people, the more likely they are to be enthusiastic about the current Franco-German relationship
Older people however, are still quite resentful towards Germans, understandably so I would say
My grand parents come from Alsace
Their family was forced to abandon their home and everything they had during the Franco-Prussian war because they refused to join the Prussian army against France and wanted to remain French
Their new house was then destroyed in WW1 and my great-grandfather was injured fighting for France
Then, WW2 brought occupation and destruction
Needless to say Germany isn't very popular among the older members of French society
However, I think that even older people have come a long way since then and are more likely to be scornful and distrustful towards Germany than actually mean to German people themselves
The typical "we don't like this group for this reason but you, as a person from that group, are different from the rest" your slavic friends have a shit attitude, sorry
But to answer your question, I come from a part of France that used to be German and I've heard that certain people in the countryside still kept a bit of a grudge against the Germans because of occupation during WW2
Most people kind of got over it though
Older generations can be very mistrustful
But since younger generations are very pro Europe, I think it's safe to say Germany is a close friend
Amongst the younger generations
Not really
Germany is seen like a different country now and their willingness to address their history is widely commended
They’re one of, if not the most, respected countries in Europe/EU now
To older generations, in France there is sometimes still resentment but not really in the UK that I’ve noticed, it’s mostly just for humour
I’m Jewish though and amongst my community
well we recognise that the culture of Germany has changed massively but it’s still a source of immense discomfort to be in the place where such atrocities happened
I have enjoyed travelling through Germany and felt safe and respected amongst the German people (although not necessarily amongst all of the immigrant Muslim population who often have a different view of Jews and I have received abuse) being openly and identifiably Jewish
Even so, sometimes it hurts my heart to know of so much suffering so recently
My adoptive grandma is from Berlin and still I cannot visit where she lived because she still suffers so tremendously and endured so many unthinkable things
I have tried, but I felt sick and obviously I know and support that life must go on but to be surrounded by normal life as though nothing happened was really difficult for me
I guess it’s different when we have personal history like that
Also, some old people are very pro-Europe _because_ of the past
My grandparents, who were born in the 1920s, both felt the need for a strong Europe and had no prejudice against German citizens: they knew what resentment had done after WW1 and did not want to repeat the same mistake
But I do recognize that both of them used the term “boche” (pejorative slang for “German”) quite often
That seemed natural to them
And they were neutral rather than enthusiastic when it came to Germany
We have them in France as well they're used to warn people of disasters they're tested every first Wednesday of the month a 12:00
That's interesting
Having lived 15 years in London I don't think I ever heard a Brit mention Germany (including at work events) without making a veiled or overt nazi reference/joke within the next few minutes
You see that even in the financial press
There seems to be a perception that Germans are a different kind of human, somewhat robot-like
I mean, do they know that the nazis planned to kill the Slovenes so "Germans" could settle there
Not sure if things would be in order, but they would not be there to find out
That's my experience too, having spent 15 years in London, although I'd put the line somewhere in the mid-80s rather than 1960
There seems to be a very big generational divide in terms of attitude towards foreigners in the UK, not just Germans
"Boche" is still heard among younger generations because their grandparents taught them
How dare you
You're the little brother, youngster born in 1871
I don’t see where the French are insulting in the video though, there are pretty much describing themselves as lazy and saying the Germans are more serious
Edit: The only guy saying he doesn’t like Germans is from Belgium, and that’s even the very first thing he says
I don't know
Here this is not the case
Please tell me this happened in the 1950s.
That's very cool, cheers
I’m 20 and I’ve never heard it
I was taught it’s insulting
I know that’s what people say, but from an outsider’s perspective, it doesn’t really come across as banter, more institutionalised bullying
Ofc it is but yknow how we work
That annoying little brother that always do better than you in everything but you love anyway
Paris is not real
It's in another dimension
When in doubt, blame us for everything please, we never get tired of this, really
I first thought Maggi was german, when it's actually swiss (and the name is of italian origin)
I thought for a long time that Total and Orange were British
My bad, they're French
I also thought that Ubisoft was American, turns out it's French too
I'm very bad at localizing brands
Here are few that surprised me :
- Ubisoft is French
- Nestlé is from Switzerland and not France
- Bugatti is not Italian but French
Ubisoft is French, not Canadian, even if their biggest studio is in Montreal
Me too
It's the same for Ubisoft (assassin's creeds, far cry etc)
Most of the population don't know it's french
It's owned by Coke, so it kind of is
Only thing i knew them for initially was their soy-sauce-but-for-white-people, but i guess they're huge sellers of instant noodle in southern asia
Wikipedia says they at one point held 90% of the market share in india, which sounds pretty big
Sure, but that's not where Julius Maggi was from : he grew up in Basel, in German-speaking Switzerland
His father on the other hand emigrated from Lombardy
[It's not Canadian]
Plot twist, they are not
It's true
And you invented the double-frieds french fries recipe
Yep, they have studios in Montpellier (France), Montréal, Milan, Atlanta, Paris, London, Berlin, Rotterdam, helsinki etc
It's an international company
&#x200B;
And it doesn't change the fact it's french
Yep, they have studios in Montpellier (France), Montréal, Milan, Atlanta, Paris, London, Berlin, Rotterdam, helsinki etc
It's an international company
TLDR: French fries are not actually belgian
The source of this common mistake is a 1871 writing but it talks about slices of potato fried in butter
Not french fries at all
The recipe is french, according to a food specialist from Liège
To be fair for a few of the stories they are actually french (Belle is one I’m 100% sure of)
They do but I thought Disney was french also because of that
No but there is a certainty that you are salty
BAHAHAH alors là c'est fantastique
Très bonne blague !
More like the courtois type then !
Thibaut Courtois was salty during the world Cup
[Link]
Thibault Courtois, Belgium's goalkeeper and saltiest person on earth
Yeah he was very salty about that, to a point he became a meme in France
This would be nice because it would help poor people better and maybe help people to spare money to pay the expansive studies but if I remember well Bernie Sanders attend to make studies free
Convincing the average American people that universal healthcare is somehow a bad thing for them is probably the most amazing marketing scam success ever
They literally convinced people that selling your house to get the treatment you need is normal and good
I was thinking about that yesterday and as a European I have a serious question
What is the plan regarding the COST of healthcare in US ? We have universal healthcare in Europe but for exemple even if you are not covered an X-Ray is like 50€. In the US it seems like  it can go up to thousands of $. If the US adopt universal healthcare but the prices don't change I just don't see how it could work, the amount of money needed would be insane
I am really not sure about this one
If you travel for tourism sure, but I moved from France to the Netherlands and had to apply for healthcare there
That's what I expect but to me looks like a really big change to the system, even bigger than just universal Healthcare one
But it's not like I see any other way to do it
Super common, only water I buy bottled is sparkling because I love myself a nice fresh San Pellegrino on a hot day
Otherwise I only drink tap water
Tap water for me too her in France, never had to complain about any kind of bad taste to it, and since I try to be Eco-friendly, I prefer not buying plastic bottles :)
It is very common to do that in France, although I know in some region you should avoid doing that because of seaweed
Other story, when I went to Germany about 3 years ago, I was quite surprised when they gave me bottles of sparkling water, the tap water was ok but apparently they just prefer sparkling water, found that quite funny
I avoid as much as possible to drink tap water as underground pipes suffer from corrosion
Also it tastes weird, like metal-ish
I don't mind buying buttles as it's a normal habit for me and around me
I'd say it's probably half and half
I used to work in a suoermarket and i saw bottled water sell an awful lot
We also have so many different bottled water marketed for all segments of people: Mont Roucous for babies, Evian for kids, Contrex and Courmayeur for women watching their weight, Hepar for people with digestion problems and so on
Special mention for cristalline which is an ulbrella brand for lots of sources across the country and the cheapest option everywhere (under 0,10€ per bottle)
And also if you ask for tap water at a restaurant in Italy they can refuse
In France they legaly need to provide that
That would depend on where you're from though
I had a few friends in some small city in the Loir et Cher who didn't drank the tap water because it wasn't adviced
I also had a fair amount of friends in Bretagne who don't drink tap water because of the nitrates (IDK if that's still a problem there though)
And my GF tends to avoid tap water
Like, until we moved in together, she would find it weird that I drink it rather than bottled water (she even thought it was pricier to drink tap water .-.)
In France, I only knew two friends who had what we call an "american fridge" (with a water and ice dispenser)
It's not that common here
As for the filtring pitcher, it's more common to see them
Especially in areas where there are a lot of farming (nitrate contamination) or with a lot of calcite in the tap water (it's not a problem for the health to have calcite, but in those areas, a lot of people uses water softener which is believed to cause potential health issue)
I do have a Brita filtering
hum
jug ? Bottle water is more expensive than tap water, but tap water can contain very small amount of lead, chlorine, sediment or other heavy metals
Hence why I decided (quite recently) to buy a Brita
Only rich people have “American refrigerators” but most people I know use Brita filters or similar at home
Where I’m from the water tastes of calcium which many people don’t like
I prefer it like that (so does my dog
) but my family insist on filtering it
>France had mixed(Paris had horrific water, but Gaillac/Toulouse had decent water)
Strange, I've been drinking the Paris water for many years and I never noticed a difference with other places, nor have I heard it qualified as horrific before
It's possible that there was a problem with your sink, or the plumbing of the building you were staying at
I was also told that myth but it’s actually fine
Most people just don’t enjoy the mineral content in the water but I personally love it
London water is my favourite tap water (unless you’re making tea and it forms some kind of scum on the top)
I’m in Manchester currently and the “corporation pop” (as old people love to call it) just tastes of chlorine and sadness
Why does evil always taste the best
I don't know how this is really happening, but apparently some seaweed are making toxic gas which are infiltrating the ground, and it manages to get into the water distribution system
It only happens in some moment of the year, and some effort have been made since some years now to avoid this
They actually call them names like Dylan, Steve, Brian and such, and usually they are people who are drunk on US/British/Australian soap operas, sitcoms
As such, it's very telling of your social class to be named with an Anglo firstname in this country
People assume you're automatically coming from the working class and your parents aren't very educated because they don't do much else than watch TV
&#x200B;
Interestingly, I noticed some of the same trend in the US, especially in poor black communities where people will be given French names like Antoine or Andre, or invented French names who don't really exist but sound kind of French
[This] says otherwise
Pretty often
Some English words have no literal translation in French, such as "creepy" or (love) "crush". I have to resort to approximate translations or changing the sentence to translate accurately
Almost never happened to me
But now I'm required to learn about 150 new words of english every weeks
So I learn words in english that I don't even know in french
It used to happen from time to time, but with regular reading it disappeared very quickly
Anglicisms are not appreciated here, we have to be careful \^\^
Not that often, thankfully
Maybe I'll struggle on a super specific word for 10 seconds before remembering it (my luck is that English is very close to French)
Pretty often to be honest
And it is frustrating but it is also a sign that I am pretty good in english so it makes me happy
All the time
I’m currently looking for the French word for sunflower (I don’t want to look it up, I want to remember it
it’s frustrating and I’m an idiot)
It happen rarely because I'm not fluent and don't use english in my everyday life, but it can happen like 3 to 4 time per month
I use english words instead of french words more often but I quickly correct me
I don't forget the french word
Oh yeah it happens a lot, especially if I just got out of Youtube or Reddit (It's often in English)
Luckily both my parents understand English quite well so I just say the word in English
It happens less when I'm in school though
... tournesol
Oui ! Haha, merci
In France: not saying hello to the shopkeeper/ the other clients in small shops
This is particularly true in smaller cities
I've seen many tourists forget to do this and they usually end up receiving poor customer service
Not saying hello, please, goodbye, to waiters, salespeople,  assuming that people will appreciate it when you charge like a truck speaking in English, and don’t underestimate the bickering a region can have against another one
In France, you do not want to denounce anyone to the police or their relatives if they did something illegal or bad (except when it is threatening to others)
This is called "Délation" and people see it as something really really despicable since the 40's.
Not only small town, my wife got into a huge fight about that with a security hard at the galleries Lafayette

Anyone know if it’s like this in the UK
My housemate’s mother died and all of my other housemates (half of them Irish) went to the funeral but I didn’t know if I was meant to
I thought it’d be really disrespectful to go to someone’s funeral that I didn’t know and, idk, watch a bunch of strangers be sad
I’m still really worried because I don’t know if I committed an enormous faux pas
I went on a date with someone who didn’t thank the bus driver
nope, that’s the end of that relationship
Same in Australia
Driver always gets a thank you, regardless of how terrible a driver he was
Well, unless they start first
I found that was the most common topic of conversation with tourists
Paris vs the rest of the country comes to mind (while it's fun to joke about Parisians, the "having to move to Paris to have the best career in your field" mentality/reality is awful)
Don’t eat carbonara in France
Even some Frenchmen put mushrooms in carbonara
Is it really different in Belgium ?
I was grocery shopping once and asked help to a store employer
Hé was kind of busy and i tried thrice to get his attention before hé noticed me
I did Say "bonjour" l'oud and clear three times but he didn't here it
He cut me off mid sentence with a Big "bonjour" and eye contact, visibly pissed at me for my lack of basic education
That is something that i don't think would ever happen to a customer in the US, at least from what Reddit taught me
In south America (more specifically Peru) you can enter a shop, say "I want this"  , pay and leave
All this without saying hello, thank you or goodbye
It enraged me at first, shopkeeper would never return my "hellos". But well, when in Rome
Fr, I saw this kind of scenes more than once, and not even between French and foreigners but also between French people who lack politeness (from a French point of view of course)
Well, it certainly seems normal to me but I have noticed (mostly in the UK and in the US but also in some Asian countries) that people don't really greet the shopkeeper or if they do, it's a mumbled "hi" without eye contact
Again, it varies from place to place (in England, people are likely to greet each other a lot in small villages for exemple)
However, I feel that greeting the other clients when entering a shop is a specifically French thing to do
It's because it's considered rude if you don't say hello to people you talk to
Advice : if someone says hello to you, always say hello as well, no matter of you are busy or late
And finally someone from my city :o
Celebrating his life as it should be
I'm guessing that maybe be because national patriotism is really frown upon because of history, so people take pride more locally instead
Is having bad psoriasis a bad excuse
> A: No, I mean "Holland
" I'm not going to fucking Brabant
This is the correct answer
Exactly this is the biggest feud that all regions can unite against, I’m also thinking of Bretagne and normandy, Lorraine and Alsace
While exaggerated, this is kind of true, parisians have it easy with probably every possible careers reunited in a single city, and all the universities around
The region of Paris is also one of the main reasons regional dialects and accents disappeared, so for me it’s just one more reasons to not like them
In lots of countries it's something disrespectful, but in France, it's REALLY REALLY something you should try to avoid
When in Vienna I was surprised how manners there mirror Parisian manners
The protocol is very similar, and I got amazing service while all my English buddies complained about the horrible Austrians
That's not my experience at all, especially if you're Western
On the contrary, they're super chatty
Maybe it depends who the shop keeper is
Yeah, I think you’re on to something but also I feel weird on the Tube because I’m a young woman and often older men seem offended when I offer my seat like “heavens no, I couldn’t take a seat from a *lady*”, idk it’s awkward
"Hup Holland Hup"?
>	Honestly, we’ve lost all hope with the french
Don’t go to /r/food it’s worst than French version of Italian food
When it depends on the shop keeper everywhere in the country,  it looks like a cultural norm
Even the grumpiest shop keeper in France is expected to salute you
Now my experience is really based mostly on Peru, maybe Bolivia, because it is true that my experience on this particular topic was way different in say Argentina, Brasil or Colombia
I should have mentioned Peru only, my bad
Thanks, it’s just that when I was visiting Peru (I went there 3 or 4 times), I’m pretty sure that my « buen dia » always got a response, and often a chat
We're the first pizza eaters in Europe (10 kg/person/year), 2nd in the world after the fatties (13 kg) and way before the Italians (5 kg)
Well we're not last but can't say that's very glorious
I trust you
Meanwhile, we get it reimbursed but we're the most anti-vax country (even worse than the US), smh
For real, you have tons and tons of good singers and not even one of them accepts to participate to Eurovision ?
"Ma Orbán Viktor újra megmentette a világot", "Orbán Viktor a legjobb elnököt", "Magyarország a legnagyobb ország a Földön"...
Well there's still a diversity in the titles and the content
well, for living there, i have never heard anybody about vaccines bad, or something like that
i don't know, maybe it's local, or something
Yeah I hate that we are forced to learn the rosbif language
[Contre toute idée reçue, un Français mange davantage de pizzas qu'un Italien
En Italie, la consommation par an et par habitant est de 5 kilos
OMG we need to bring that back
I had no idea this existed
Oh no no no wait not that quick
Based on the sample size here I'm curious as to what constitutes 85% of a person
I like how both countries want to be first at it while it's not very glorious
Well, at some point we've been enemies with the whole fucking planet
Talk about discussions being akward
Lol
Én: *Mondom azt hogy Trianon mellett születtem*
A magyarok:
All my homies hate Carthage
...until you tried to tell everyone that the raclette came from switzerland and not savoy
Never got a problem about this while we spoke several times of this with my Austauschpartner it was more a meme than something else
De Trianon egy szép kisváros
Cool
My opinion is that Napoleon was a very complex character, he was neither inherently good or evil, but he did things which were on both sides of the spectrum
Yeah it's mostly focus on banter
"Oh we  won Agincourt, muh arrow better than horse
" said the Englishman, "But we won war with cannon, silly Brit using archer against artillery
" said the Frenchman
Then take that banter and change the name of the war, the order of the the one talking and the mean of winning and you have most of the Franco-British back and forth
And the fondue aussi
I've seen a Swiss being angry at France for killing Swiss guards (they guarded the King) during the revolution, but that is so very specific than I'm quite willing to bet he was an outlier more than anything
Ja tudom de mindenképp viva Trianon
We might be unreasonable, but we respect ourselves, see, our head of state don't come gliding with tiny flag in his hands
[*cough*]
Aaah hors de ma vue hérétique
Yeah, in the meme department, I have to agree, yous guys decided to go all in, we can't challenge you in that
I'll accept your meme dominance, my good sir
(Did he really elbow bash the kid though ? It looks like he went all in on the poor little dude)
> long may she reign
You don't need to wish she is immortal, we also have one of [those] but he doesn't have any corgi, so he is not as epic, I'll give you guys that one
Didn't realized it was in Japan, the kid seemed to have had a fun time though so no harm done
> “Doesn’t this undermine my whole raison d’être for being here
I'm admiring the honesty here, it's kinda beautiful
Well i guess one needs to realize than the wealthy difference between those "rich" and "poor" means that in "rich" countries people can buy nicer cars and spend more on iPhone
But all those countries  are highly developed places with efficient healthcare system
So all in all it has more to do with the lifestyle, and not the small difference in purchasing power
What happen if there's multiple car going past speed limit
How do the police officers to cope with it
I don't think it's a very good idea
I think i heard than some a country had come with a system in which the fine amount was defined by how much a person was making a year
It's closer to a good solution in my mind
Fine in percentage of your wealth would be efficient too
Three strikes is a lot
I drive like 3-4 hours a day often over the speed limit like you do, I get like 1 strike every 15 months or so
The point system does hurt but I'm still not driving at the correct speed despite not having all the points on my driving license
Not really the same but my region and a couple of others have something called "les 100 jours du bac" (100 days of the baccalauréat) where high schoolers disguise themselves and don't go to school, instead they just go in the city, give candies to random people and sometimes ask for money in exchange, it's still very popular around where I live and you can see hundreds of kids doing that every year around february, 100 days before the final exam of high school
Nine time out of ten I can't understand a word of what they're saying when they pretend to be french
The scenes are very funny, as they tend to sound like utter gibberish
I see it really often
What annoys me is that they make fun of French people for not having a good English accent, but I can't even understand a single word when they try to be "classy" and speak French
"Eh Voaaahlàà"
I am french and I don't watch movies often but I do watch animes and when voice actors tries to speak french, their french is always super mispronounced and all but I always like it because it is fun to hear voice actor trying to speak french and give what they can and how does the author can admire France
It honestly hurts my ears when they try to say things like “voilà and “déjà vu,” the pronunciation is never good
Yeah, that's horrible
I remember watching an episode of heroes and a woman was speaking french, I had to watch it 8 times before giving up on trying to understand what she was saying
Also in iron man 2 movie at some point there is a cop speaking, and like i'm not from Nice, but i'm pretty sure he shouldn't have a canadian accent
I think in all the marvel movies the characters that were supposed to be french had very pure canadian accents
And when it's a native speaker he's from Québec
It sounds funny to us and when it's a serious role, it takes out of the movie
Yeah most of the time it sounds like someone trying to do a Russian accent rather than French
And the one time out of ten it’s understandable, it sounds posh and English, like if an English man were trying to have a sexy French accent
I have nothing against the English, but don’t expect me to think that this guy is French
Oui cest terrible
What ?
Lol, I'm sure you do not pretend to be french :)
I don't find French classy
The word "croûte" sums it up
But I find Italian really beautiful though
Incompréhensible et condescendant, là c'est le combo
Iron man 2
Captain america the winter soldier
Haha, I am indeed French but I did not meant that my accent is sexy (I actually think that it’s ridiculous)
What I described as sexy is an English accent in French -some English men use a sexy tone of voice whenever they speak French, it’s funny
and sometimes it kinda works
Yes that’s true
Yes, not only on mountains but also in the countryside
Definitely yes, and not only on mountains but also when hiking near the sea for example
Actually where I live you can tell the difference between tourists and locals pretty easily : tourists always seem surprised
Well basically we say hello to barely everyone we see so yes
I just went hiking last wednesday and yeah I greet other people, I mean it is kinda awkward to pass next to someone really close and not say anything
A simple hello or sometimes a quick exchange about anything really
So yeah we don't ignore people we give each other the Bonjour :)
In the mountains, in the woods, in the coast path, sometimes even in the streets when it's a small village
And obviously, you *have to* say bonjour to the shop assistants, cashiers, waiters, bus driver etc
Yes, pretty much the only time we say hello to random people we pass
Of course, and I'd extend it to our countryside as well
The only time we greet strangers
Well not at all I have no idea where you live but I say hello to everyone I see in the street lol
I biked along Route 8 from Flensburg to Copenhagen this summer, and also greeted people, I was generally the first to do so but they always reciprocated
I’m French (it was my second time in Denmark) and we greet others a lot, including in elevators, so I just did it naturally, not even thinking it could be unexpected
And in the elevator
I don't know, I great strangers everywhere
I mean, I never greeted a stranger in public (except in the countryside), and a stranger never greeted me in public so idk
Well of course if there are multiple strangers at a place we can't great everyone, but it it's just one or two strangers walking on their way and that we meet them I always say *Bonjour/Bonsoir*. Even if it is in a city, a town, countryside, mountain or whatever
Oh my god
When you say Bonjour and the other guy say Bonsoir
Anyway i greet people in waiting rooms, the bus, in the countryside, the store owners, and people who greet me in general
Hehe yeah that's embarrassing, but at least you can comfort yourself that you're polite because you greet them
I agree on where you said you greet people, seems to be the most common places where greeting is important
Weekly strikes
Not being on time for informal events
If your friend tells you the party starts at 6pm, you don't show up at 6, but more around 6:15, 6:30
It's called the "fifteen minutes of politeness"
Kissing when encountering other people
I tried to do this in other countries
Bad idea
La bise I assume
More specifically la bise with your colleagues
In France they do this with stuff like interviews or reality shows, I can't imagine watching an entire movie dubbed like this
Not really
It's considered crazy by similar people everywhere I think, but it's not specific to Belgium
I think they're not talking about the Fridays for climate strikes, but about the strikes by workers on a regular basis for every reform ever
If French don't like something, they take it to the streets
Yesterday, it was the truck drivers, railway and transportation workers, teachers, and more, against the retirement reform
Two weeks ago, it was uni students for poverty among young people
Inbreeding isn't really a problem unless it's repeated over several generations
In fact I remember reading that a slight amount of inbreeding is optimal
You're probably safe marrying your second cousin, in terms of genetic proximity it's barely above marrying someone from the same village
It is more optional than most people make it out to be honestly
My girlfriend does not kiss anyone at work because she does not want to and no one really cares, people just shake hand with her
The second one certainly isn't.
No they're overdubbing with actual voice acting
It's nothing like what the Polish guy is referring to
As far as I know, Down syndrome is unrelated to inbreeding
Actually they don't, strikes are typically on Tuesdays or Thursdays specifically to avoid that kind of abuse
In France, if you strike on friday, you'll be considered on strike on saturday and sunday too
Your employer will remove 3 days out of your salary
I find just one so weird
It feels intimate
No, though I guess you might find some in Paris and some other big cities, but hammam and spas are much more common
I think it's because here kissing once on the cheek is something you do with a partner so it's associated with intimacy
Joyeux Noël et bonne année !
Joyeux Noël !
Joyeux Noël et bonne année !
Je vous souhaite de putains de fêtes aussi bois and grills ! :)
first of all
*how dare you*
**Être soûl comme un polonais** : be drunk like a pole
Use about someone who is completly drunk but It seems the expression come from Napoléon :
« After a decisive battle of Kozietulski's Polish Light Horse in Spain in 1808, the heroic survivors of this elite unit were paraded before Napoleon
French generals, jealous and wanting to minimise the role of the Poles, indicated that the Poles were drunk
The Emperor replied: "So, gentlemen, know how to be drunk as Poles
**Branlette espagnole** : spanish titjob
**Fort comme un turc** : be strong like a turk
**C’est de l’hébreu pour moi** : this sound like hebrew
In France we say "filer a l'anglaise" which means leave the English way
We have the same game as your first example, but we call it the arab telephone
For the "it's all greek", I think we would use "it's all chinese" (c'est du chinois) but I'm not 100% sure it's actually a thing
We use "the Englishmen are landing/disembarking" when we have our period
When someone can barely say 2 words in English, we say they "speak English like a Spanish cow"
>"sair à francesa" (to walk out like a french) - walk away sneakily, without being seen, being sneaky
English speakers also say “to take French leave”, but in French, we say “filer à l'anglaise” (to make off in the English style)
I have a hard time understanding people from Quebec sometimes, due to me not being used to the accent, even though we both speak French
I had a German colleague - we worked in an English speaking environment- who, upon being introduced to me, launched into a friendly and longish greeting and explanation of I don't remember what
I was confused he was speaking German to me and had to irrupt at one point: "I'm sorry, I don't speak German".
He replied: "I am speaking English" :'(
The accent was so thick that my brain honestly did not recognise a single word
I burn with embarrassment every time I remember this
In music class when i was 13 we listened to the french version of Hijo de la luna
And i kid you not after hearing it for the first time half the class thought it was japanese
When somebody tries to speak French in a movie to appear sexy, I 100% never understand or think they are talking about some cheese brand
french rappers are the best to say total understandable nonsense
Yes
Once I was in the metro in Lyon and facing two strangers chatting together
I was wondering which language they were speaking because it didn't sound like anything I knew
After a while I realised it was actually French with a really thick Québec accent
I also once watched the Québécois movie "Crazy" and needed subtitles
I think it's because I had never really been exposed to that accent before
Now I regularly watch Québécois youtubers etc
, so I don't think it could happen again
That used to be the case for French, until about 10 years ago when suddenly they started hiring (not always very good) French actors to speak French
Some kind of Italian creole
Interesting
Embarrassing story time
I met my first person from Quebec ever as a kid on holiday in the US
I assumed they were American trying very hard to speak French
I could not understand a word they were saying, so I was answering in English, being like "don't worry it's ok I speak English", while they stubbornly insisted on speaking (a version unintelligible to me of) French
After three-four embarrassing minutes of this exchange, I realised they were saying "je ne parle pas anglais" and their parents had sent them to the US to learn
That day I learned
Also, French in songs is ununderstandable
Especially when the singer is Japanese
It's more than a hard time sometimes
I was in a business meeting in Toronto when a person wearing native clothing came to talk to me
I just answered "Oui
", and she hapilly came back with a coffee for me
I was not sure at all what she had asked me
Also recently I was trying to figure out how to use a fire stone and I found this video:
I could understand about 3/4 of what one guy is saying and 1/4 the other guy
When I was living in Lille, one guy called me about my house with a strong northen accent
I couldn't understand a word
It *really* depends on the person singing for me, some person not speaking French saying or singing stuff in French are completely ununderstandable, other are not
Same here
My roommate telling me "Va ker la wassingue dans le trou" took me a bit of time and explanation
Ch'ti isnt exactly french though
Yeah, but did ya do it ?
Yes, I figured out they were rural people with a particularly strong accent
You missed a great opportunity to dunk on the swedes here, are you even really Danish
You know, most of the people who work at my McDonalds including me are university students, so treating us like lowly idiots makes even less sense in that regard
Gotta start somewhere right
Supermarket cashier was often said, McDonald as well but it's more seen as a student job
Same thing with McDonald's, or they say "you'll end up being a hair dresser/garbage man"
I get that there's downsides to these jobs, but there's some in every single job, and these are pretty well-paid, so yeah, doesn't make much sense to me
Plus it pays farely well, and you only work a few hours a day
Well said
If only more people thought like that
When I was a teen, I spend 2 weeks in the USA, my host family asked me:
\- if we had  sinks in our houses
\- Their 15 years old son asked me if I had to go to school by horse
\- what was my favorite red wine (I was 14
\- not to take their son's virginity, because "here girls are not easy like in france". They were scared I would try to "seduce" him (again, I was 14
and I had never kissed a boy)
Also they took me to a supermarket and show me how it works like "isn't it great
you take what you wants, put it in this , then you go to the lady and pay
great right
". I had to politly say we had supermarkets in france too
And they gifted me a picture of washington DC's subway as a souvenir
I know not every american are like this but come on, the parents were college teachers
They were very nice and lovely to me, they made sure I had fun (they took me to a theme park, a baseball game and a boat trip to baltimore
) and felt welcomed  and I'm so grateful for it but they treated me like they were doing some kind of humanitarian mission
The classic "france surrender military bad" and no, we don't all cheat with everyone and no, it's not seen as normal
Some people seem to think that the académie française has a legislative power and that everyone religiously follows what they say, some even think you can be fined for using English words when an equivalent académie approved French word exists
Académie française is an assembly of semi senile people who are widely ignored by 99% of people
Not me but my cousin who studied in the US had to assure an American student that travelling to Paris was perfectly safe, she was not going to be abducted by Albanian gangsters and be sold into sex slavery unless her dad had "a particular set of skills". She basically believed Taken was a documentary
* The French hate Americans
* The French are ok with pedophilia
* The French lost every war
* The French are racist to anyone who is not French
We're nice, don't hesitate to ask for direction :)
"French people always surrender in wars
Your flag is the white flag
" even though France is probably the country with the most wars won (in terms of wars won/numbers of wars)
Haha yeah I hate it when North Americans automatically look at me to choose wine at dinner
I know next to nothing about wine and we can't grow it in my region
> "here girls are not easy like in france"
I heard this one many times from north americans
Also the "all french dudes cheat on their wife".
[Would I lie to you]
I've heard that from French people too
It's always entertaining to listen to left-wing and right-wing Americans talk about socialism in Northern Europe
I understand that the news, especially cable news, are dumbed-down so people can understand but still, it baffles me that smart politicians like Bernie Sanders make that mistake
Well
I'm sorry to say: I still don't like red wine much
I prefer white wine
I swear I'm french\^\^
Our knowledge of eastern europe is embarrassing af
Yes
at least I tried to
My english is bad today, but when I was 14 it was
well, you know\^\^ I knew enough to understand but not to reply so I just weirdly smiled for 2 weeks
But they took me to visit the city with a segway wich were new at that time and didn't exist in France yet, that was really cool
I live in Bordeaux and don't like red wine
Foreigners are always disappointed when I say I don't know shit about it
I can help with rosé or white though
lool I 'm glad to see I'm not the only one
In deed
hahaha
I can imagine that\^\^
It was at Washington DC, I was from Lyon, it's a small city for american, but the third for us
But I would had love to go to school with horses
I wish :)
hahaha I didn't think about that
maybe next time ;)
some of us have bidets, but sshhh ;)
I wasn't a exchange with a school, my mother knew a french teacher (I don't know from wich school) and asked her to find a family to host me and an other one for my best friend
We went together, one in each family then their sons went to our home for 2 weeks too
haha no, they asked me NOT to take it
They were worry I would try, I gess
I only cheat on the weekends, that doesn't count
It's actually closer to the etymology of the word
They replaced the *f* by a *ph* at the beginning of the 20th century to make the word looks like it's coming from ancient Greek, but it is actually coming from Arabic/Persian, so they went back on that decision in 1990
In Californian universities apparenťly
Polanski
He's in France since the 70's and there's no legal ground to extradite him back to the US
So people just assume the French are ok with pedophilia
Our knowledge in general is embarrasing
It's nice to know I'm not the only one
Sadly no
I got similar questions when I was there as an exchange student
The parents also tried to explain to me the concept of a supermarket, I didn't really react because I didn't really understand what was happening haha
Other kids were asking questions like "do you have a TV in your home
Electricity
Shampoo
" etc
Good intentioned and lovely people but I feel like some of them spent their entire lives only looking at their own navels haha
It’s socialist by US standards because Americans are much more individualistic and also have been brainwashed for decades during the Cold War and told American capitalism is only way
The weak political cultural, 320 million people and only two political parties, does not help
let's just say we appreciate the effort
Depends on what you eat with it
The white/mixed community in New Caledonia is known to have a horde-riding tradition
But it's probably not so much the case anymore
She still went to school at 120 yo ?
We have so much to make fun of, I'm glad you can enjoy it   ;-)
I don't know, I guess because here it's more common than in the US to talk about sexe
while they are more modest about it
Also the " abstinence is better" thing doesn't exist here
It was a math joke, because 5
=1*2*3*4*5=120
I'm sorry
Our freedom ends where other's freedom and rights start
And children should have the right to a healthy life and to not be subjected to their parents' stupidity without their consent
Children's interests have priority over their family's power to potentially ruin their life
I fully support Germany and hope all other countries will eventually follow
Absolutely, we should not leave public health in the hands of irrationally retarded people who don’t understand science
If the lack of vaccination only hurt themselves I would be against forcing anything but herd immunity is a critical factor and the children of anti vaxx parents are not responsible for their parents’ stupidity
Flu shots are less effective for elders, this is why we ask to the rest of the population to do it too
Same in France
From English to French, I have an edition of Lord if the Rings that says “ne m’oubliez pas” for “myosotis” (they translated “forget-me-nots” literally, as a sentence rather than as the name of the flower)
Same for water lilies, but those do not seem _that_ out of place
I mean, I’m French it would be “nénuphar”, not “lys d’eau”, but those at least sound poetic
The forget-me-nots, on the other hand
that sentence was painful to read
Recently I saw the menu of a French restaurant in a touristy place, it was written in French and English
They translated « Foie gras fait maison » (homemade foie gras) to « Foie gras House »
Just under it was : « Saint Marcelin » (the name of the cheese) « Holy cheese Marcelin »
I read that as “castrated cook” for a second
Made me laugh
That article/post was super interesting
Thanks
I bet they knew it
This just reminded me that there was a time when eating bulls’ testis was a thing
What's your hometown
Lived a year in Malta, never thought cycling was an option given how people were driving :p
I don't think tourists would derive much enjoyment of a visit in Nieuw West tbh
It's 35°C in southern France, and I'm stuck in a classroom all day because I'm taking my finals, which have been delayed because of the pandemic
I'm definitely not okay
31° in northen France, where houses are made to keep the heat
I've started to make room in my fridge, I think I'll live in it now
South of France here
Not unusual for this time of year unfortunately
It was much worse last year
The nights are still pretty cool, so it's unpleasant but ok
If this were as hot as it's gonna get I could handle it for the time it'll last but we know the worst is still coming
The hot weather doesn't bother as much as the need to keep windows open at night and not getting any sleep because of mosquitoes
I live in Southern France and it's 27°, it's not very hot for us  but I'm sure that I will suffer more in July or August with 35/36°.
Thank you, I'll try and do my best :)
I have a fan, that's as far as my plan goes
The first few days it starts getting hot I can still manage to keep the windows closed at night, so I just let my windows open as long as I can before bed then I gas them and myself in the bedroom with a good old can of raid
Well, if you don't have anything to refresh the air, you just suffer in pain
At least we got the sea at 10 minures so if it's really hot, we can spend the afternoon at the beach
The one I have stinks, but I prefer that than spending the night fighting against the mosquitoes
Ah, lovely diagonale du vide
In short, because there's nothing there but fields
So the land is mostly used for agriculture
A ridiculous amount of French people live clustered around Paris
Metropolitan France has ~65M people, and 12M+ of those are around or in Paris
If you want a historical answer, the empty spots are mostly due to Rural Flight, when most people crowded in cities due to industrialization
I lived near the border between the Center region and Bourgogne
There used to be a lot of metallurgical plants in the area, some dated as far back as the middle ages
But they all closed now, as they couldn't compete with German's steel and most of all, Chinese exports
These plants, and other factories, used to feed economically wise the whole region
Their workers spent their wages into local clothes, bars, libraries, in turn creating what is called in economy a "virtuous circle".
But since these jobs disappeared, most folks realised that they or their childred needed to move elsewhere to find employment
There are exceptions of course, and thanks to wine production and some agriculture, there is still some activity there, but way less than it used to be
I've seen a little town having shops for basically anything, including video games at the end of the 90's.
Now the whole majority of these businesses are closed
That is quite chilling tbh
Yeah I never understood why 70% of the posts there have a bunch of deleted comments as answers
literally have only seen 5 posts with actual answers there
"A return to partible inheritance is probably the most easily described component"
I always cringe when i see this theory brought up, it's nowhere near the more logical explaination, for several reasons
People just don't chose to have children solely in consideration of inheritance laws
Besides france's legal system was, up until the revolution, far from unified and partible inheritance, while very common, was not the only system in france
Half of the lands where owned by nobility and clergy, which means that many peasants used to work lands that were not theirs anyways, so the idea that they would refrain from having more children (and potentially limiting their household's income) simply in ordre to preserve the right of their children to inherit something they don't own is odd at best
The most logical and obvious explaination is that medieval agriculture technics simply could not support more than a 30M inhabitants
And given the regularity of famines in the country up until the industrial revolution, that seems way more likely
Malthusian policies could also be part of it
I've always been interested in the Azores
How is life there
Usually we don't talk about Guiana in the info except if they protest
From what I hear there is a BIG problem of violence + no employment
Most of the people live on the coast, Brazilian illegal immigrants are common since the frontier is so huge, so more poverty emerge
I'm pretty sure there is more positive fact, but we are so much centralise that I don't really know what can I share you more as just a french leaving near Paris
Don't you think that self governance is enough of a reason in itself
Much of what you're saying has been used for 1900 Ireland (or current northern Ireland for that matter)
I see, it does look good tho ;)
I've never been to Portugal, but I really hope to visit the Azores one day
Any particular island to recommend
Wow thanks a lot for your advices
I'll save that comment for future uses :D
Also I'm sure Portuguese people don't like when we talk Spanish to them
I know it's a beautiful place nature wise, is there anything worth seeing on the historical side
Interesting
Really thank you for the answers :)
Yeah, would be cool
OP could make one thread per day with the date as title
Sub please
Thanks
Hope your pet is fine
>What are people from your country born with
Anger
Contradictory spirit also
It would make biking harder though
Damn
I work at a tax office in France and we just ask people to send us a mail with a copy of their id so we can ascertain it’s them and we send the number back
It’s insane to think an administration may be more obtuse than the French one
"You're just born, now you have to pay all the medical staff that helped you to born
Damn, I will print this comment and give it to the next guy who claims we are being difficult
Nationality vs Citizenship .... FIGHT !
When I meet a Wallon or a French-speaking swiss, it feels like they are actually French with an accent and living under other laws
I guess nationality is a question of point of view
I'm from the other side of the border, from Dunkerque
We're French but at the same time we claim that we're Flemish as well even tho almost none of us actually speak Flemish
But we do have some Carnival songs that use flemish words
Come nie mee
Come nie mee
Come nie mee Nae boven
Travelling around the world makes me feel even more French than just going across the border
And I've noticed the only Europeans we can consistently get along with in terms of group dynamics are basically Latins and Germans
Northerners are just as remote as Koreans
French third
I'm from Dunkerque, we often go to De Panne or Oostende for the Waffel
I've travelled a lot but I've never thought of identifying myself as an European, wherever I am in the world when asked I say that I'm French
Might very much be, in France we make a distinction between Nationality and Citizenship, but it's more or less the one between Ethnicity and Citizenship
Once I even made the trip by foot from Dunkerque to De Panne, it's a continuous beach and sand dunes, it's like a 3h walk, really nice in the Summer
Technically speaking, from the etymology of the word, Welsh, who comes from the German "Wahl", means "someone who doesn't speak a Germanic language". So, for them it was the people speaking a gallo-roman language
When the Saxons and the Angles invaded the British Isles then the local people (Celts), who weren't speaking a germanic language, got called Welsh
Same in Belgium, the "Walloons" have the same etymological origins, in Belgium they are surrendered by Germanic speaking people so for those Germanic people, the "Walloons" are "the ones who don't speak Germanic". In Romania, who speak a roman language, it's the same and it gave the word "Wallachia". And also in Switzerland, there's a group of people speaking a Romanche language and they're called "Welsche"!
So, technically, if you speak English (which is a germanic language) but not Welsh then you are not a Welsh ;)
I'll say that in that case the person will be Canadian
To me the language is the most important aspect to being part or not of a culture/nation
For example, between someone that was born French from French parent, still has the citizenship, but moved away at a young age and doesn't speak French, and someone who speaks french fluently/natively but isn't of French ancestry and doesn't have the French citizenship then I'll definitely consider that it's the one who speaks French that is the most French in that case
But I understand that it isn't the case everywhere, in France, having a share common language was quite pushed to the population over the past centuries and is definitely a strong defining characteristic for us
> Say you lived in Quebec, had fully quebecois ancestry but went to a English speaking school outside of Quebec, only knowing a small amount of french, would you be Canadian, or quebecois
Anglo-Canadian, without a doubt
You can't be Québecois or French without speaking French
You can be black, you can be a three-legged whore, you can be a fucking duck, but you can't *not* speak French
I think that's more or less the universal answer you'd get from French-Canadians and French people
I heard that Saint-Etienne is an ugly city and Brest is a very brutalist city, I love the concrete and brutalist architecture tho
This is the ugliest town I've ever seen holy shit
Having lived in Saint-Etienne, the city is pretty ugly but people are super nice
I'd rather live there than in Lyon
Grenoble is my homecity and is mostly super ugly
The surroundings largely make up for it though
Le Havre has the same reputation as Brest
My mother lived in Brest and in Cherbourg, the only thing she ever says about those cities is how ugly they are
St Nazaire
Also, I'd say that Gueret is pretty lame
Wait what's wrong with St-Étienne
Brest is the real winner, but Le Havre is a close contender as well
I scrolled down to find the first comment from a frenchie
So glad Marseille is not in the list <3
I love Köln though
Don't know if it's pretty or ugly but they surely know how to karneval
Just looked them up and while they look fake af it's still a nice type of fake, like Hollywood
If you want ugly touristy mediterranean towns, look up La Grande Motte
Damn if that is a criteria for you, don't ever come to France
Don’t know if it’s ugly but it seems like one really boring city
It’s near Cinque Terre, but it doesn’t have the charming buildings or dramatic cliffs
IMO La Spezia was nothing amazing but it wasn’t bad either
If *that’s* the worst that Italy has to offer, I think the country must be pretty damn good-looking
That's because of Perret, but honestly the church and all is really classy there
The volcanic rock is cool as hell though, I actually found it rather pretty when I went there
"Full of roundabouts"
Almost all the cities that are considered as being horrible were built in the 1960’s, the same goes for the Parisian suburbs and Marseille
A famous architect « Le Corbusier » even wanted to destroy the historic center of Paris to build those ugly cheap buildings because « It would be more practical ». Good thing it didn’t happen
Because you were in the wrong cities at the wrong hours
Crack heads
crack heads everywhere
It's a mix of lack of government funded assistance for those who need mental care and the general culture at large
I mean, it's not like you don't see crazy folk on the tube/métro in London or Paris, but it's certainly not as prolific as in some major West Coast cities or economically struggling rural areas in the States
I think the way that Americans tend to look at the world can be very stressful
There's a zero-sum mentality that both drives them to be as productive as possible while burning everything they have to sustain themselves - often out of necessity, since weak workers' rights and unconscionably high costs of living via insurance (health and auto), education, transportation, and lodging make life extremely difficult
Combine that with the sheer prevalence of religion in the country, an absurd "bootstrap" mentality that blames all failure on the "personal character" or "moral fiber" of an individual, and a primary education system that promotes a myopic and dogmatic brand of patriotism that makes the country seem above the world rather than of the world, and you've got a recipe for some crazy-ass people
**Article 1**
France  shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic
It  shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without  distinction of origin, race or religion
It shall respect all beliefs
It shall be organised on a decentralised basis
Statutes shall promote equal access by women and men to elective  offices and posts as well as to professional and social positions
In the preamble of the construction there is also:
Preamble
The French people solemnly proclaim their attachment to the Rights of Man and the principles of national sovereignty as defined by the Declaration of 1789
It would have been so funny if this law was the first article of Bavarian constitution
...  confirmed and complemented by the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946, and to the rights and duties as defined in the Charter for the Environment of 2004
That part is important as well, as those 3 texts (and the preamble itself) are therefore part of the "block of constitutionnality", and have constitutionnal value
They don't
They don’t have much power compared to German Länder, sure, but I think that the idea at some point was to never again have something like Louis XIV’s hyper-centralized state
I’m not a specialist, though
Edit: plus, this is the beginning of the actual Constitution and I’m not that sure that Louis XIV was the first thing that came to mind in 1958
It may have more to do with the way the third and fourth Republics were organized
Statutes, not statues (not sure if you were joking\^\^), but yes, we do have a thing for statues
"The republic of Poland is a republic :p "
Yes, it refers to the separation of power and that a single man don't have absolute power over the state
Edit : I was apparently wrong, look at the comment below
From 1958 to 1971, the Constitutional Council (our BVerfG) only controled the respect of the articles of the Constitution, that is, only the respect of the institutional rules: the articles of our Constitution enunciate almost no individual rights
The preamble was straight up ignored, as it holds little normative value (as you can see [here]
But in a case in 1971, the Constitutional Council refered to the preamble of the Constitution, and thus gave normative value to the preamble, but most importantly the texts cited in it (at the time: the preamble of the Constitution of 1946, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789; the Charter of the Environment was added in 2004, but it doesn't bring much in terms of rights or obligations)
The Constitutional Council basically said that from then on, it would not only be a guardian of the institutions of the French State, but also of the rights and liberties of the citizens and of the rule of law
Nowadays, people can object to a law or a justice decision on the basis of the rights & values enunciated in the texts that the Preamble cites
Certainly does not, this was just a cheeky word play
Not a thing on r/france, but we did kidnap it one time
A Portuguese guy threw a piece of cinder block at me
I went to porto (portugal) for a week with a friend
We stayed in a youth hostel near Gaia, just outside of Porto
The hostel was big and had a terrace with a great view of Porto
For several days we noticed that a man in hoddy was watching us from his window when we were eating on the terrace
When we turned our heads in his direction, he either kept a stony face or he would wave at us
At first, we though it was funny
Then we started to get a little scared
Every day he would stand there at his window and watch the passers-by
One day, he came down on the little wall above the terrace and waved at us again
We ignored him
In the afternoon, as I went out on the terrace to smoke, I turned around in the direction of the building
And there, he threw a piece of cinder block at me
From his window
Wtf
&#x200B;
Except that:
* I saw an English girl entering the London Underground with a huge helium balloon shaped like a dick at 7am,
* A drunk dude from New zealand threw up on me because I refused his advances
It was in the London underground again,
* A old and scary Thai soldier asked me to do a selfie with him in Bangkok,
* In 9th grade, during a school exchange in Leverkusen (Germany), I went to a German secondary school
When my class arrived at the school yard, about 30 young Germans stood at the windows and sang "voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir". Was weird
I went to Peru with a group of 20 people or so when I was 18
We did a 3 days trek in the Andes and it was at the time of the Pachamama (1st of August)
Our guides were Quechua people so we all observed the ritual together
It was really peaceful and weird
We all took the coca and had to keep it in our mouth for the whole ritual
It was a really good memory
I was in Krakow, Poland
Obviously a very touristic city so there were a lot of shady people
One woman accosted me and my friends to go in her strip club
We followed her because we were drunk af and it turns out it was a completely empty strip club (except the dancers) with very shady things on the "menu"
hahaha, wtf ? I hope she get a copy of that picture, it's really funny !
And yes, I staid one month in Cambodga/thailand and I have been taken in photo a dozen of times
Mostly by chinese tourists though
I guess they are not used to see foreigners
I live in a big german city and there is no such thing
What's fascinating to me is I hadn't even noticed before reading this thread
It's a big plus for me, public transport is already tiring enough without adding extra noise and so on to it
They have mirrors or cameras to be able to see every door in case of an issue
How [frencher] can we get
[This one] because of all the meme we got
Like [this one] or [this] [this one] or [this]
I prefer [this man] who braves the elements to seek his basic needs
How about [this] ? Stylish too, since we have that reputation
Daily routine Var edition
I'm sorry but if I have no baguettes anymore, but I have [this] After Paris, deep countryside
This picture needs far more attention
It reminds me [this]
Hmmmm very good, you just need someone lighting a cigarette with the fire in the background and it's perfect
The overseas territories tend to be ignored by the government
Even though France owns a lot
The north that has suffered greatly from the de-industrialization driven by the neo-liberalism of the European Union
The mass unemployment that has been caused there is terrible
Idk if it's known or not, but during WW2, Nazis forcefully enrolled Frenchs to serve
The term Malgré-nous (French: "against our will") refers to men of the Alsace-Moselle region who were conscripted into the German Wehrmacht or the Waffen-SS during the Second World War
The French wars of Religion
I'm sure some people have heard of it, but I doubt people really understand the scale of it
\~3,000,000 Frenchmen died, which makes it a death toll higher than our death toll from WWI and WWII combined
If people understood the extremely bloody and painful part that religion plays in civil conflict in France I think they would be less shocked about our laws/culture surrounding religion today
I found a video about Swiss history online months ago and it was really interesting
The main takeout of it was that Swiss are fierce warriors since ages contrary to the popular view
You also had a PM shot dead while in office not so long ago I think ?
I was taught that in school so I don't think it's that obscure (last year of highschool)
They also forced hundreds of thousands of French people to work in Germany
Also, almost two million French prisonners spent the war there and some were also forced to work
Learned about that in highschool
Et les noyades de Nantes
Then now's the time to follow /r/100yearsago - you'll got a day-by-day retelling of the 1920s for the next decade
A lot of Republican exilees fought with the French armies in 1940 and then from London or overseas after the fall of France iirc
That's mainly post war french communist propaganda, claming that Dien Bien Phu was "The SS last battle". It's true some men that were in the SS were also in the légion at DBP, but by the time the war started most of them had been purged
The difference is that the Malgré-nous were later accused of warcrimes
It left a wide open scar for these people
I'm Alsatian, and even if i don't know of my family having lived that, i'm really sensitive to it
Here :
(Edit : removed "Sir", sorry)
One of the division that was first sent to Paris was mostly (entirely
not sure) Spanish that helped the French army from more or less day 1
Un de mes ancêtres était un chouan
Drinking wine in anything that isn't a wine glass
No one around me really cares, but I always have an hesitation moment before pouring
Same goes for cutting the cheese
Always a doubt about how it is supposed to be "properly" sliced
The sunday's admonitions of my father are still vivid, that's for sure
That always bothers me when visiting other countries
In France, if you ask for water, the waiter will ask if you want tap or mineral water
Same with bread, you don't even have to ask for it and it's free
Really
Here it's always included and normal to ask for tap water, it's usually the same quality as the bottled one anyway
We are lucky in France that it is common to ask for tap water
It is better to specifically request "une carafe d'eau" instead of just "de l'eau", since if you request a carafe, it means it is not bottled water, hence meaning tap water
Some restaurants though purposely keep these pitchers of tap water at room temperature so that if you want cold water, you need to order a bottle
It is a sly move, but it happens
It is very unusual to request ice though
So if you ask for tap water and ice, you are definitely crossing the line
I swear, watching foreign people trying to cut cheese makes me scream internally
Like chalk screaking on a blackboard
I'm sure that is how the German Gestapo used to torture French resistants
Same here
But I can drink a beer in a regular glass without even thinking about it
I wish it was the same in France (it's basically becoming illegal though
) I absolutely hate this shit
Why 5 precisely
Made me remember I drank first at the exact age of 5
Jaywalking when there is no traffic
Probably because most people have a proper lunch at the same time as a drink, something unheard of in the Neherlands
Yeah I think it is 15 in France
May be legal but definitely wrong
Water, bread and even sometimes olives and/or pâté are free
Worse would be for me to see someone smear Foie Gras like it's some supermarket grade paté.
[Relevant video]
I think most of us have been there to be honest, or from half pint glasses for that matter
My mom will eat the sunday chicken with her bare hands, so there goes the étiquette as well as my father's love for good table manners
Well, we have specific cheese knifes
As for cheese slicers, I have only used them on very specific cheeses, like a sheep cheese like Ossau Iraty
You go and try cutting camembert, brie or Roquefort with a cheese slicer and tell me how it went
Yeah, knife makes sense for most of our cheeses
Cheese slicers gives you a wide and thin slice of cheese
We don't really have a use for those
We have cheese knives and opinels
Sure thing
It's just "not the way it's supposed to be done". At least that's what I've been taught, and it makes sense if you want to enjoy wine "the proper way". A duralex glass is not the perfect glass to "shake" the wine for it to release its flavours and then dive your nose in it
My guilt is proportionate with the quality of the wine let's say
Yeah I don't even own wine glasses
Ah, what should I say then ?
I must have been around the same age, my father had me try beer, and I thought it tasted horrible
France does it even better
It's free and you get a pitcher
No need to get a waiter annoying you every 10 mn
Add to the list salad, peanuts and chips
But free pâté? That's the first time I've heard of this
I am interested
No, but tap water is
I thought it was the same elsewhere
Jsp on boit de la Vittel ici
No French want a thin slice of cheese
We want a good chunk of cheese
That's maybe why
For me it was wine
I lied on the sofa for the rest of the day
Free rillettes would have been more accurate, but yes it definitely happens in some places
Most of the "proper" cheese cutting etiquette is based on trying to get equitable slices from all parts of the bloc so no one ends up with just the crust
So if you think about that before cutting, there is 99% chance you are cutting it correctly
We don't really eat that many sandwiches in the first place
And when we do, the cheese if often in a rectangular parallelepiped form (if not spreadable)
Plus most sandwitches you make yourself are in a baguette, not between square loaves of bread, so the cheese slice doesn't really fit
That's a bad point
Is that a good or bad point
where is here
Oiseau (bird) is the only French word that doesn't sound at all (wah zoh) like the letters it's written with
I'd say entitled cunts speaking it
That seems pretty French to me
We have the only Romance language with a fucked spelling (seriously, who could guess that "oiseaux" is pronounced [wazo]
In French, we have a word that changes all its letters at plural form:
"Œil" means "eye" and "yeux" means "eyes".
English has the same thing (example: freedom, from Germanic roots, vs liberty, from Latin roots)
Same in French, that little "ouais" you pronounce while inhaling air
All languages with genders have no rule for it I think (for knowing French and German I can tell you that's just random)
Tudtam de soha nem értettem miért, tud valaki a választ
Ich gehe noch zur Schule could also mean you are walking to school but it is taking a while no
For an example :
- Wo bist du, uberblau
Frau Müller fängt gleich mit dem Unterricht an
- Ich gehe noch zur Schule
Ich musste einen Umweg machen, um die Demonstranten zu vermeiden
Hab noch nie gehört jemand sagen "ich gehe ja eigentlich zur Schule". Es klingelt wie "ich bin so froh dort zu gehen"
Same in Hungarian, and there even postpositions like -ba/-be, -ban/-ben and -ból/-ből.
Hungarian
Like what
Hungarian has it but only for suffixes
You can absolutely have dark and light vowels in the same word
Ø exists in Danish, å in Swedish and Finnish and æ in Latin
Sorry
Same in Hungarian:
"Giorgios is here": (A) Giorgios itt van
"Giorgios' house": Giorgiosé ház.
"Call Giorgios": Hívd Giorgiost
There is no vocative but plenty of other cases:
"I'm going to into Giorgios": Giorgiosba megyek
"I'm inside of Giorgios": Giorgiosban vagyok
"I'm going outside from inside of Giorgios": Giorgiosból kimegyek
"I'm talking about Giorgios": Giorgiosról beszélek
"I'm at Giorgios'": Giorgiosnál vagyok
"I'm going to Giorgios": Giorgioshoz megyek
And so go on, there are 18 cases in total, I think no European language has more
Funny that you'd use the *liaison* between the words "pas" et "un" in your example since it's not uncommon to **not** pronounce it, whereas the next two ones have a mandatory one (un [n]ami)
Notice that aa doesn't exist in Hungarian
They would write it á. It only exists in compound words like visszaadja
The scientific alphabet of Gabon also uses them
Yes but not at all like the individual letters it's written with
Yes, all I'm trying to say is that no letter is pronounced like in the alphabet
There's no other word in French like this
If you don't know how to read French there's no way you can deduct the pronunciation from the spelling
Me neither
But I try to hide it by pointing out other people's mistakes
Yeah I found it because I was thinking about the same thing as you
Winter time
Having light in the morning helps me wake up and not feel exhausted all day
Totally worth having less light in the evening for me (especially since I wouldn't enjoy it
Because too tired)
I guess I'm weird for needing sunlight to actually wake up though, most people ask for summer time here
Winter time, because it has the solar time centered on the EU (instead of summer time, which has it centered around Ukraine)
Did I understand something wrong or do people here don't make sense ? A lot of people seem to say they can't stand the free time in the night, so summer time
Those people prefer to have sunset after 9am and sundown before 6pm all winter because they don't want to be out in the night ? What ?
Summer time because it's the actual solar time duh
You're going to get in the dark both morning and evening with a "normal" 9-6 schedule in winter with summer time
People seem to forget the change works both way
To get more sun in the season where sun is abundant already means wants less sun when it is rare already
The natural time is the summer time lol
But work hours are an *even more* arbitrary human invention
Instead of working from 9-17h, we could work from 8-16h, and voilà: it’s equivalent to summer hours
Shortest day (around December 21st) in Belgium is like 8:30 to 16:30
Change to summer time and you get 9:30 to 17:30
You don't get more sun after work and you're in the dark until 9:30, eww
Those people here that say they want day until 11pm in summer but night from 5:30pm to 9:30am in december
Wtf
I'm with you there
I hate when it's still dark at 9:30, I just can't wake up properly and then my whole day is ruined
But having a dark evening doesn't bother me at all
Is it worth 9am dawn 6pm dusk in winter ?
Summertime = December sun rises at past 9am and sets at before 6pm
December gonna suck so hard in summer time
You go to work, it's night
You come back home, it's night
Day doesn't matter when you're at work
So it's perpetual night for you for the entire winter
Gotta get those vitamin supplements because you gonna need them
Summer time December = no sun before 9am and after 6pm
Calculate sun times in December in summer time lol
Its already dark as fuck during winter in the morning when they go to work/school, at least with summer time they will not have to get back from school/work in total darkness too
Not sure if you are serious but summer time is not solar time at all
Call the Polizei, that german doesn't want to wörk ! Get him quick !!
(jk)
Except in winter you're in the dark both arriving and leaving work with summer time
Personally, as someone living on 50°N and suffering from insomnia, I'd rather have more daylight in the morning to reduce my melatonin consumption
Sunrise in winter is much too late on DST
Also Summer days are getting unbearably hot and I'd enjoy cooler temperatures earlier in the evening
> Also I don't get it
Just go to bed an hour earlier or get up an hour later and you have the same amount of sleep
That is what i do everytime, and guess what
Couldn't fall asleep cause i was used to winter time
Well let's not make it worse then
Why reducing the sunlight when it is already rare ?
Up there maybe but not here
Staying up a little late, yes
Go to bed early
Only if you feel tired enough to need it, so in order to be tired enough for the time change night i need to sleep less and be tired the day before
This is madness
You sleep when you are tired, if you are not tired you don't sleep
I mean its pretty simple
During the day when i'm feeling well rested i do not fall asleep randomly
In 2016 we were the first country to adopt new laws about food waste
Supermarkets bigger than 400 meters square have to seek partnerships with local associations to give them unsold food items
No country has won more Nobel Prizes for Literature than France
Of all countries which observe an “Independence Day”, 26 of them celebrate their independence from France
An I like this one
In France, you can legally marry a dead person, since 1959
And the best for the end
It is against the law in France to name a pig “Napoleon”. We have our pride
We are also very proud about the declaration of human and civi rights of 1789
And the rest is coal ?
> And the best for the end
It is against the law in France to name a pig “Napoleon”. We have our pride
This is not true at all and never was :
It does not even makes sense, farmer don't name their pigs ...
The closest that can be found on the subject is the editor of the first edition of "the animals farm" of G. Orwell who renamed the pig César
The law was created in 1959, after the Malpasset tragedy, the destruction of a dam
The tragedy killed 423 people
So, posthumous marriage is  authorized by article 171 of the french Civil Code
Law was first created during first world war
It was reintroduced following the destruction of Malpasset dam on December 2, 1959
Aim of the law is the legitimisatin of the unborn children whose fathers died as a result of this tragdey
Maybe, but the story is far much funnier than the fact that the law really exist or not
I've never seen a stray dog in France, just because a dog is walking around doesn't mean it's a stray
We use nuclear for around 70% of our electricity production, that's around 80/90% of clean energy with renewables
France is a great country for beyond understanding administrative process
Marseille, Palermo or Naples
Let's do that in corsica !
London would be interessing
Marseilles or Naples, or even Corsica
There was a game similar to GTA, I cant remember what it was named, but it was based in Nice and it was pretty good game
Napoli was my first thought, but you're right about Marseille too
Counterpoint: Malta irl is too small for an open world game
Without spoilers: you visit Malta in AC
I've just started the series and I'm looking forward to see familiar places
True, but half of that looks like de_dust without buildings
I thought of Just Cause as well
It's a game that's badly written as opposed to GTA, the goal of the games anyway is to inflict mass destruction, not having a great story
In a sense it's satire thought, as everything are stupid clichés and you can do crazy shits
It doesn't take itself seriously is what I mean
What is the biggest "tourist trap" in your country
Paris as a whole
I'm only half joking
First, there's too many tourists for it to be really enjoyable or romantic
The Eiffel Tower, Trocadero, etc, everything is crowded and packed full of people
Second, it's really expensive
Compared to other places in France, restaurants and cafés are truly more expensive (because of tourists)
Some tourist activities like going on a boat along the Seine will also empty your pockets really quick if you're not tight enough on your budget
Third, people trying to sell you shit everywhere (tiny Eiffel towers and stuff like that, way too overpriced) and people who will mug you (speaking from experience)
The touristic spots are very touristic for a reason, and it would be dumb of me to not tell you to go there
However, I would recommend you don't expect a romantic, lonely, magical Paris experience because you will never get that
Go see the monuments for the view that they bring, but don't be disappointed when you see the sea of people
Go on a walk among the less popular areas, pack your own food, and for the love of God, don't use backpacks, and put any cash and IDs in a jacket that has inner pockets, or that will get stolen
Mère Poulard restaurant in Mont Saint-Michel from what i've heard
Any France tourist area restaurant is going to be expensive and disappointing
Preparing your trip in advance and finding small restaurants that locals appreciate is mandatory
Surreal post in this time
Experiencing withdrawal ? lol
Europe has so many castles tbh
I agree
Neuschwanstein is beautiful but the town and mountains are breathtaking
The Alpsee with Tirol in the background was one of the most spectacular sights of my life
I was so disappointed to be there only for a day
It was a school trip and teachers only made us visit the castle and shops, but the trails looked even more interesting
I hope to go explore them by myself one day
I agree with you
It might be worth one visit, but I enjoy the other cities much more
Yes I do agree that Versailles is ovverrated
I like though the gardens better than the palace
And the Louvre is fascinating
That's actually kind of a smart move
La Place de l'Étoile (Arc de Triomphe's roundabout's name) is
an experience
So I live nearby Paris (15 minutes in RER)
And let's be honest, if you don't know Paris, your description is a decent match ( a tad to harsh maybe but I've seen worse)
But:
> and few legit French dining opportunities
That's false, while it's not the easiest thing to do (because you have to look for it in less touristy land), if you're friends were unable to find good French food in Paris, they either didn't search or are bad at it
This city is choke full of insanely  good restaurants, a simple google search in the area you are and you'll be able to find a good one quite easily (of the genre of your choosing)
> Huge crowds and traffic everywhere, rare to find a quiet area
I mean in the densest city in France (one of the densest in Europe too), that's sadly a given
Still, that can be somewhat circumvented if you are able to go outside of classical vacation times (end of May-Early June/ Mid-September would be my pick)
> France has so much more to give than only Paris
Also true, and if you aren't able to find a timeframe outside of school vacation times, I'd advise to go shoot for the rest of France
Take care though, some area are also choke full of tourist depending of the period (Every coast and mountains ..)
I just can't understand american people on the paris subreddit always talking about going to Disneyland
WHY
In another comment I recommended Normandy, but you'll probably want a change of weather
I think you might enjoy the South of France
There's the Cité de Carcassonne, a medevial citadel, but it's a touristic spot - -' I think that renting a place/going to a hotel in the region, and then go on a search for local curiosities, wander around the region
Some interesting places in France:
- Le Palais idéal du facteur cheval (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)
- Colorado provençal (Provence-Alpes-Côtes-d'Azur)
- Cascades du Hérisson (Bourgogne-Franche-Comté)
- Sundgau (Grand-Est)
- Vieille-ville de Troyes (Grand-Est)
- Puy de Dôme (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)
I am biased, as I'm from here, but I do find it peaceful and calm
Small villages and small towns are great if you want to be submerged by French culture and the language (you're less likely to meet other tourists)
Very beautiful and it's really worth it
But as other said, it's also very expensive
Just for an idea, one of my friend paid a medium pizza at a local domino spizza 25 euros
The worst is that he was italian, so he complained about this misfortune for the rest of the trip haha
Yeah
Someone stole my phone in Barcelona, but the police found it and gave it back to me the day after
They're good
It was kind of a nice experience to see a bureaucracy being so effective tbh
I guess they only care about stupid tourists like me
At least I met a lot of kind people trying to navigate the city without any phone or any way to contact anyone
Probably cheaper now since the zone system was ended for Navigo passes
One of the densest city in the world actually
(for a 1st world country)
You have the same park at home (and probably even better ones), why travel thousands of kilometres and go to another country to spend 2/3 of your time in a queue
I guess with all the holidays at the end of the year, more people are at home celebrating with their family and kin :) Even if Paris around Christmas time sounds very romantic (at least more than in heatwave-and-bugs summer)
Great question
They have Paris and great places around it but no they must visit the 'murican place
If you're not afraid of cold water even during the middle of July, I would say Normandy
It's not highly touristic even during summer, and has some very pretty sights
It does have the same shitty weather as Britain, but a little rain never killed anyone
:) A "major" city in the region is Cherbourg, located next to the sea
It has a museum about the sea, due to its history as a harbor
They even have a titanic exhibition
I would recommend going biking or hiking in the countryside, around the fields and woods
It's very fun, quiet, and you'll be surrounded by cows (seriously there are so many cows in Normandy)
And I love the local food
Nothing like a good camembert normand, with the cider to go with it
And due to its place next to the sea, you can also enjoy variety of seafood
Another place in Normandy which is very famous, but definitely a tourist spot/trap, is le Mont Saint-Michel
It's a very nice and peculiar place, but it's very crowded (which isn't helped by the fact that the place itself isn't gigantic to begin with, with its narrow streets)
You're welcome
I only just realized that you're American, so you may also appreciate visiting the beaches from the Normandy landings during D-Day
Honfleur, Bayeux, Étretat, Cabourg, Deauville are really nice cities in Normandy
Also if you are a fan of WW2 history you'll have plenty of things to visit
I really, really like cheese
Especially "smelly" ones
I love bread and often tuck the baguette under my arm whilst puffing away on a cigarette
I'm probably gonna enjoy a glass of wine over dinner with my roommates
Of course, we had an apero beforehand, with various types of cheese,  charcuterie and saucisson
We talked about brexit and joked about how stupid the brits were for having done that
Oh la la
Is a genuine reaction that can be used in pretty much any context/setting and I say it more than I dare admit
On the other hand, my English is pretty good and I don't live in Paris with a view on the eiffel tower
Edit: my rommate is working on the tower's painting campaign,  so there's that
Not cliché: I shower every day, I don't have hairy armpits nor legs
I'm faithfully in a committed relationship and I don't think cheating is fine
I don't really care about fashion
I have never in my life worn a béret or a marinière (stripped top
) I don't smoke
I don't play the accordion or even listen to it regularly
Maybe cliché?: I don't think I'm rude, but I'm more direct than people from Anglo-saxon culture and I can see why it could be a culture shock to them
I do think it's rude if you assume I speak English when I'm in the street or in a store, or if you start asking stuff without saying hello (but I will still answer
) I have not eaten frog legs nor seen anyone eat them before I was in my 20s (I now live in an area where they're common though, and I like them a lot
Cliché: I do love food, and would be sad without good bread if I lived abroad
A good wine is important with a good meal
I love complaining about a lot of things, especially our politicians
I don't drink wine
I drink very little alcohol
I eat bread but not baguette, I prefer whole grain loaf
My favourite bread is called here 'german bread' (pumpernickel)
I don't smoke
I don't dress up and put make up everyday
On the other hand, I do eat lots of cheeses
And meat must be rare (unless the freshness has been compromised)
As for the specifically Parisian cliché, yes I don't speak to strangers in the street, even if they look lost
Sorry
I love bread and cheese and complain a lot
But:
\- I'm not fancy, I love nothing more than burger + old sweatpant + the lord of the ring night
\-  ~~I'm fat
~~      Fine
,  let's be positive: I have *curves*
\- I don't smoke
\- I don't like red wine
\- I'm a bad cook
\- I shave (like most french women)
\- I shower (idem)
\- My baby throw food (maybe because I'm a bad cook
\- I can speak English decently (even if I'm not fluent)
\- I'm nice and friendly to every one (which is not always a good thing
\- I don't wear beret because no one does (except foreign fashion lover tourists) but like it
I'm bad at being French since I hate protest
I'm good at being Breton as I have a 2
5:1
5 meter flag
I really like cheese, am quite proud of my cooking skills, and often carry my bread under my arm
On the other hand, I despise coffee, am not much a fan of wine, speak good english and loathe garlic
Also, I fit the Breton cliches of being a bit *too* proud of my region, of handling alcohol well and often eating crêpes and galettes, but I do not eat most seafood and do not drink cider
That's when you know they are good
Pretty much the same, and I drink café au lait in a bowl for breakfast
I'm also guilty of carrying my baguette under my arm lol
You forgot to say whether you had a mistress or not
How close do you stand to people (either people you talk to or to the next people in line) to the closest ~~10~~ meter~~s~~?
I hate it too
There's an order to be respected
First, fill out empty double seats, and then, if that can't be avoided, seat next to someone as a last resort
>I hate jamón serrano
How is that even possible
How can you not like village festivals
They’re among my fondest memories growing up in southern France haha
Hey I have the same opinion about Tintin and I've offended a lot of my fellow countrymen by saying so
Cheers to that boys
I'll drink to that
Nope, (or at least none that I know of) but we have LOTS of cheese with mold
Btw may I see I love Italian cheese, it's so good and salty
In Corsica, yes
On the continent, it existed in the past
My father remembers cheese with worms when he was younger, but it's been almost completely forgotten now
I don't think anyone makes this kind of cheese any longer, other than in Corsica
Je connais personne qui fait ça... je parle du café dans un bol pas de tremper son croissant en fait
Not me but
Idk, i don't live anywhere near it but my roommate is painting it so it's a funny coïncidence
In regards to previous comments
To give you an idea, we usually spend 10-15€ each for food and drinks
So 400g charcuterie,  600g of cheese, beer, wine, and chips, appetizer (quiche or pizza for example), main course and desert
We usually cap it with a digestive
That's for 5 or 6 People aged 23-29
Do you bike everywhere
Lol the onions
I discovered it was a stereotype last year
The good People of roscoff, Brittany (Bretagne) realized it was quicker to cross the channel and sell their onions there rather than to go all the way to Paris
Yes, there are only 2 places in France, Eiffel tower land and Provence
And a long thin moustache for every man and never shower
Women don't shave also
And that's true we were all in the Résistance
Mes deux parents l'ont toujours fait, c'est pas si rare si ?
Ma mamie ne prends son café que comme ça.
Fair enough, it does get repetitive after a while
I LOVE FETA SO MUCH
I once had the wonderful idea to eat a big portion of feta in one go
Never had my mouth been so dry before
Chaource, Coulomniers and Morbier (mold) are among my personal favorites
Edit: cannot write
Non c'est normal, et tu trempes tes croissants dedans
J’ai bien l’impression que si
Tutti bene
My brain didn't process the mistake when i was proofreading
Call the inquisition !
>rainy London
sounds perfectly accurate to me
In Eurotrip, it's really meant to be over-the-top, it lacks the following scene in the hotel where they're rich with 50 cents
That reminds me of a show in France called Mafiosa, about organized crime in Corsica
A lot of the cast, including the main actress, aren't Corsican and don't even speak with a Corsican accent
I never watched but apparently it's a good show despite this
It's a great movie though, but I don't remember much is shown about Belgium
I live in Nantes, I know all about grey days with drizzle
The only one I could think of is "The EU is actually Germany trying to recreate the Reich," which I heard a few times from French people (on Twitter under tweets mentioning the EU mostly)
There are some people who believe a conspiracy that says 1000 years between antiquity and renaissance have been completely made up by at choice the jews, the freemasons, the satanist elites ...  In short, the usual suspects lol
I mean she is obviously a vampire, so it's fair to make the mistake between immortal bloodsucker and friendly-neighborhood eater
We can't trust the Swiss anyway
Poles were serbs all along ???
Not the same kind of influence for France and Germany, Germany has way more weight in internal matter (thanks to it's economy), while France is now the only somewhat "kinda-heavyweight" outside the EU (since no UK anymore, and thanks to nukes/army)
I think it was mostly to have economic deals and prevent war
So in a way, prevent any country from taking over Europe
That's a star, which is even more impressive
It's so far fetched that I like this one, it's cute
Did you hear the one about Columbus' real place of birth being Calvi, in Corsica, thus making him Corsican
Half of my family is from Corsica, I heard that one a couple of times
That's just brilliant
Never heard of it, but I'm barely surprised it's from Corsica to be honest
My handwriting is a cursed illegible sacred relic if you pronounce it you'll awake the nine fallen kings of men realm
I've almost never seen "a" written by hand, mostly "ɑ"
I briefly went to a primary school in England and it was always taught to write ‘ɑ’ but sometimes kids would try to be cool and write ‘a’. I remember half the class getting a detention when we were about 8 years old because they decided to write ‘a’.
The only time I really form it like an ‘a’ is when I’m writing æ.
I write "A" because I forgot how to write in lowercase by hand
I do when writing in script
In France we just joke about not giving back Alsace and Lorraine when we meet a German lol
In France we joke about avenging Jeanne D'Arc or reclaiming Louisiana/Québec/Nouvelle France
We have l'Alsace-Lorraine so everything is where it should be xD
Well, pretty much everyone in France consider Belgium (at least Wallonia + Brussels) and the French part of Switzerland to be French regions
It’s a very popular meme in r/france
When the riot thing started in the USA we were like, let’s go take back Louisiana while they’re not looking
Surely only flanders though
My whole family is alsatians, and I don't think anyone there wants to be German
Ain't happening xD
1812 best year
It's not so well known, and doesn't involve the eternal Anglo
'cause where friends now xD
Shhhh
We might be able to get away with quietly annexing them next time they can't form a government
Besides, we need the beer and the Netherlands needs the wine
Though come to think of it that means we should probably get Flanders and let them have Wallonie
The German state didn't care about the Alsatians when the region belonged to it
If i remember correctly, the region was not even fully integrated
(See: incident de Saverne/Zabern-Affäre)
On the other side, the French state took advantage of this situation to give birth to a pro-French feeling among Alsatians
Yeah I know, we make the greatest things but we fuck up right at the end
(༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ)
Annexing takes a while to plan, I figured I'd be optimistic and bet on you having a government sometime in the next year or so, which isn't enough time to infiltrate Wallonie and make it look democratic
You're in, mate !
French medias haven't talked about it at all
Yep, they talked about it on several medias today
We can send special Révolution forces
Their massive debt
Vat
Taxes
It's very different than here in France
Not saying it's bad or good just very different
Tipping
I can't wrap my head around the idea of waiters being so underpaid that they expect customers (who already paid for their food) to also pay them for the service
Bosses should start paying their employees decently
"As an Irish-American I..."
"Oh, your parents are Irish and you were born in the USA ? Cool"
"No, my great great great great great great great great great grandfather had a cousin with the irish citizenship"
And others variants
And worse of all "I know how to recognize good french food, my great great great great great great great great grandmother was born in Brittany"
Just shut the hell up
The whole race concept is super weird
Had an American teacher (English teacher), and when we would talk about social issues, society, etc, she would use "race" in English and then struggle to use another word in French, because the word "race" is the same in French but has deep racist connotations
In france you get paid and can stay home :
* 3 or 5 days per year for caring for sick children *(edit; this is a common feat from private companies, but it's not mandatory)*
* unlimited sick days if a doctor says so (broken legs, depression, burnout, bore out, you name it)
* 4 days for your wedding
* 1 day if your child gets married
* 3 days for a birth in your home (yes, even if it's not your child)
* 7 days if one of your child dies
* 3 days if your wife/husband/sister/brother/parent dies
> 3 days if your wife/husband/sister/brother/parent dies
Mhmmm
Can we combine them all
Sick days for children is not in every company
Mine doesn't offer any, however we are entitled to 2 days per year of paid leave without any medical prescription
Typically it's for when you're sick but don't necessarily need to see a doctor, but you can use it for sick kids or even a hangover if you want
Only a biscuit ? I get offered a whole meal afterwards
if you're ch'ti
Yeah you'd get 100% of your base salary
We can thank the communists
Maybe I didn't understand but it's for every company, public or private
You'd typically have to prove that you are moving by giving a new address to your employer
Depends where in France
I've gone to places that offered a sandwich afterwards, and others where I just get unlimited snacks, but I try not to abuse it
Or Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes
Yes, correct, it depends on the company
I was mostly replying to the previous comment, not to OP
Yeah you can ask for it but you don't get paid (that's in the link you sent)
Mine is unlimited snacks and drinks : sandwiches, biscuits, cookies, cakes, coffee, water, you name it
I don't abuse it either but it's a nice incentive to donate lol
Please, if you know why it's not true, explain why, it will be more productive for everyone
Ah god dammit, you right, i'll edit my post
yeah i edited my post, i was wrong !
No probs
This post is really great ! People probably won't see this but thank you very much for telling the reality
On the internet, Nordic countries are often idealized and cons are not discussed
This is refreshing !
French people do that all the time
Not specific to Scandinavia
Imma spill some beans
Lozère
Nature all around
The Gorges du Tarn are partially located there
The place is so sparsely populated that I am sure that they didn't have any problems with covid
The best unknown city in my region would be Blois, France
It is not very huge but have a impressive past and really beautiful architecture
It have a castle built on a hill that stand over the city, the castle is very representive of the evolution of the French style castle from the renaissance to baroque with all of those styles are put together next to one another
It also have a house of magic where mechanical dragons come out through the windows
It was an important place of the late middle ages during the crusades, even a king of England was a "de Blois".
It is
I loved it
Really nice city
Have you been to this other Italian secret destination, Venice
I went to huesca for an highschool trip
It's was very pleasant, i enjoyed the sierra de Guara and the Loarre castle !
Siena is generally considered part of Florence's surroundings
It's gorgeous though
Not quite, as Pisa is further
But it takes one hour to drive from the cathedral in Florence to the one in Siena, so a simple day trip
"Bite" means "dick" in French
"Verge" also means "dick", but more formal/medical
Peter means "to fart" in french (or to break in modern slang)
But the pronounciation is different
Fee means fairy in french aswell
But well french has ~~Italian~~ latin, Greek and Germanic roots so it makes sense
EDIT: i wrote italian, but I meant latin obviously
Fée in French for the fairy
The bit about dick is a good basis for jokes, though
But I have a poor sense of humour, they say
I think there's a complot about squirrels because whatever the language I translate "squirrel" to it still seems unpronounceable (e.g. écureuil or Eichhörnchen)
In Czech/Slovak/Hungarian it's kurva
&#x200B;
I guess that this is the word that unites the Visegrad group
Embarassé in French has even a slightly different meaning
And that my friend is a really common mistake made by French people speaking English
Faux amis are the exact opposite of what OP is asking
*Dia* in Spanish (with an accent) and Portuguese come from Latin *dies* while Swedish/Dutch/Danish/Afrikaans/Faroese/Icelandic/Norwegian *dag* and German *Tag* come from Proto-Indo-Germanic *dagh*.
In German it's schön :)
The Italian “colazione” also looks like “collation” in French which refers to a snack
\>  to exit = salir
&#x200B;
That's funny because in French, *salir* means "to make dirty"
I love that I learned that
Thanks
(If you ever meet a French guy named Paul, do not nickname him Popol
That’s one of our names for dick, same reason as yours
Fairy is féérique (btw it's fée)
Ah it's "va te faire enculer" in french
It's macska in Hungarian
Yeah that's exactly the opposite of what OP was asking
*Fée*, for sure, I omitted the accent as it didn't matter in this context
However, *a fairy* litterally means *une fée*.
I'd say it's the same in France
Yeah I understood don't worry I just wanted to say where do both come from :)
You guys are a hidden latin language german took so much from latin
My thought exactly
People from countries sharing a language with a bigger country, do you feel overwhelmed by news related to this bigger country
I've lived in both French speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland, I was surprised to hear a lot about France politics and see France related news in Belgian and Swiss medias
Meanwhile in France we don't hear that much about Belgium or Switzerland
Is it the same with other languages and what's your feeling regarding "big brother" presence in your country's media feed
On regional news in the north of France we hear about Belgium
Yes the US is indeed a special case given its position in the world
For English in Europe it would maybe be more about UK presence in Ireland medias
On n'a jamais vue autant de seum lié un pays non plus
I do not want to leave France but if I had to chose i would go to Germany without hesitation since I love our common history and I’d like to learn the differencies between our countries
Idk if thats a good reason but when I visit (or live in) a country I love being surounded by history that make me think of where I come from, Europe is nearly paradise for this reason tho
Denmark !!! dear danish, i felt in love with your country, it is beautiful !! but the language is sooo difficult to learn
Outside of France probably only Portugal or some part of Spain
Maybe Croatia
Been living in Germany for 7 years and I'm happy I'm leaving soon, I don't really connect with the germans, most of my friends are from latin countries
In general I don't like the germanic mentality
Been to Denmark, Norway, Sweden
it's beautiful in Summer but honestly I will never want to live there
UK is also a no-no, they're just not really social and fun to be with imho (sorry)
I had a good time while travelling in Croatia, people were really nice so maybe I'll also appreciate living there, but I don't know enough
I think that Italy is a bit too conservative, I prefer Spain/Portugal
Imho, people there are much nicer and social, you enjoy life so much more than in Northern European countries
Kind of sucks that there's not much job there because that will be for me the best places to live in Europe (with France of course)
Eastern / central Europe
Czech, Slovenia, Poland
Once you speak the local language you can learn the others very easy
They have nice forest ( even if in Poland they enjoy to destroy forests ) and good quality of life
Finland
I really enjoyed traveling there, and, apart from the language, it seems it would quite easy to adopt the local way of doing things in general
The language seems a major PITA to learn tho, and the wife is really, really not into subpolar climates
Sweden seems nice
I would live in Germany just to speak the language
Idk why I love German so much
I would live in the UK if I could and the language wouldn't be a problem so excluding that I guess it would be Norway or Iceland
Austria, i pretty like Wien
When i took their commuter train, I've fallen in love
compared to ours
Germany
I went to Germany a few times, and I really like the country and culture
If Italian politics weren’t that fucked, Italy
But considering Matteo Salvini has a tik tok and I can’t even remember who is the prime minister because they change so often, I’d rather go to Iceland or Denmark
The Netherlands, I spent my summer 2016 there for an internship in Delft and had a great time
I would gladly go back
There is no bad weather, there is only inadequate clothing
Spanish is easy to learn when you speak french
I know of two french people who went to work in Denmark, both fled the place after one year, they couldn't stand the Danish people anymore
and our great shared artists and scientists like Chopin and Marie Curie
[Elle te plait pas ma sœur ?]
That's what a lot of people think, but no
It's very hard to accomodate to another climate
When you've live all your life around the medteranean climate, which is rare around the world, you'll have a hard time living full time somewhere where the air or temperature aren't the same :/
Some fishes, vitamin D and a lot of booze
Yes it does
I'm a Mediterranean guy living in Nantes and I can confirm this
i'm so stupid haha !! i didn't remember there are belgian people who only speak dutch
sorry
at school, i was pretty good for irregular verbs
I'm pretty sure you can find really good friends in Denmark but from what my friends told me is that it was just extremelly hard to socialise with the danish as a foreigner
They ended up feeling really lonely and after trying hard to make friends they just gave up and returned to France
We generally refuse to speak it because it's the language of our ancestral enemy
Lot of french do speak it but often they'll just pretend they don't. Like the flemish when they pretend they don't speak french
Mediteranean Guy living in Toulouse is already a change
It's even more intertwined, from my experience with our school system you'll get mocked if you try too hard in english class, so you mostly learn grammar and vocabulary and you barely speak
Leads to people being shit (or believing they're shit) at speaking english when coming out of school, so they're self conscious about it, they try to avoid speaking english and they never improve
When I moved to London I could write, read, understand english very well but I was mumbling and losing words when I tried to speak
First time I got shitfaced it all unlocked and I was speaking fluently, so it's mostly a mental issue
Many french friends, in London or in France, told me they had the exact same problem
Also we don't work on our accent, natives usually don't understand us when we try to speak with their accent so we instantly revert back to a caricatural french accent that they seem to understand better
Once in Apex Legends
Cancerous team mates insulting in French
Mid game I told them in french to shut the fuck up and next time before saying shit they should check if they are speaking the right language
Assholes
Fun fact: the *only* cancerous team mates I tagged with in Apex were french
Way to go boys
I'm French and American, on a visit to the US we ended up on a bus and a French family was on board and assuming nobody understood (we were with my mother we speak English with) and they were having this very lengthy detailed conversation about family drama, kind of awkward for us
French here, I knew this because one of friends with Spanish roots had one deck, so I played with it once, I think
So I guess it is very uncommon here, and you definitely can't find a deck like that in stores
In France we also have the tarot game that uses it's own special deck of cards
I knew about it because I browse Wikipedia a lot, but I never saw one IRL
Obviously in France we use the international deck
And beware, because there are some differences between a French deck and and American one
Basically a French deck is more rectangles and the American one is more squarish
But the card's designs are the same
In French the card are called:
Hearts: Coeurs
Diamonds: Carreaux (that means a tile/square)
Spades: Pique (a pike)
Clubs: trèfle (a shamrock)
>French deck
Briscola and scopa are the best card games
Many friends of mine come from Italy and we always play when we are at the pub
French have other decks too : tarot
I have one like that
Can’t tell you were it’s from, though, it’s just
always been there
Mysteries of life
My grand mother used to play "Ronda" with the Spanish deck, so it does exist in some part of France
Neither did I.
Me neither and when I went to Wikipedia :
>The most popular standard pattern of the French deck is sometimes referred to as the "International" or "Anglo-American" pattern, but the name recommended by the IPCS is "English pattern".
HEY ! This is so unfair =(
>I didn’t even know the normal ones where french
Is a brit having an epiphany ? Everybody in France knows this, since forever !
That must be why I don't know them
I never lived in the South
Do you know if they also invented the tarot rules ?
I mean, I’m (pretty) sure it came from my grandmother and she never went to Finland, so that seems unlikely but who knows
Maybe one of her friend brought it back for her
Clearly
It's not like restaurant is a french word and concept
The english just forgot that when they eat beef/porc/poultry seated with knife and fork it's french cuisine, or at least some kind of attempt to imitate it, when they eat cow/pig/chicken with their bare hands it's english
Do you think elder people should pass a test to see if they’re still fully able to drive ?
At some age, our vision, attention and reflexes decrease, putting ourselves and other in possible danger
But, removing the right to drive can highly limit the movement of elders people
What do you think of this ?
God yes please
Only if the doctor orders to revoke your license, there’s no driving test or medical test just for driving
It was a genuine question, I did not seek everybody’s agreement, that’s why I wrote two opposite argument in the post
There many way to disagree with this statement : people might not want to loose time passing a test, people might not want to pay for it, etc
You’re free to post any question you want in this sub Reddit if you’re not happy with what’s currently posted
In some countries there is no renewing your license, you get it for life
IIRC, a doctor can only say that you are incapable of driving anymore, but that doesn't suspend your licence automatically, someone (private individuals
the *préfecture*?) then need to act on the doctors opinion to have the licence removed
Also, you can't force people to go see a doctor most of the time: I have personally met a young woman, with several physical handicaps (partial blindness and deafness, violent tremors, etc
) who had been trying to get her licence for years (and failed everytime) but no one could prevent her from trying
Thanks for the info
Had some family members killed by a 69 years old driver who totally got away with it and merrily went on being a threat to other pedestrians
On the other hand, one old uncle of mine got his license snatched from him at 80 years of age by his doctor after he'd checked his terribly bad vision
Being tested is great, I think
Wish someone has the balls to implement that in France
I'll wear a jacket under 23-24°C. Under 20°C, it's getting cold
Under 16-17°C, I usually wear a good jacket and a coat
Under 12°C it's really cold and under 7-8°C it's freezing
I like heat, I feel comfortable between 25 and 34°C.
However quite few french people are the same as me, most would feel good between 15 and 25°C, and cold under 5-10°C
Well I don't wear jackets, so
I haven't started to wear coats yet this year, but it's getting close
probably under 10°C or so
&#x200B;
Parisian region btw, you'd obviously get different answers from people in the South (much warmer) or in the East (much colder)
Below 10°c it's winter coat and scarf, hat only if it's windy
Below 5°c I dive my toddler a hat but not for me
Below 0°c I add glove/hat
Below -10°c I have a warmer coat like I would have to ski but only if I stay outside for a long walk for exemple
I'll start heating my home when the temperature inside goes below 19°C.
I live in Southern France
20°C and for me it starts being cold
It's currently 16° outside, and if I go out without jacket + pullover I will very likely get cold
anything below 20°C without sun and some minor wind is considered cold in France (need a jacket)
In summer I'm always in T-shirt, else I wear a pullover under 15°C, a jacket under 5-10°C and ski pants below -15°C (which didn't happen since 2012 :/)
Living on the mediterranean coast, I'm not used to being cold
So I would say 15°C-12°C : cold (thin jacket), 12° and below : freezing (big coat)
In my city, I never experienced a temperature below 0°C, and that was like 10 years ago
I was wearing a T-Shirt until 2 weeks ago
Chilly weather : under 10°C, down to 5°C if it's humid, down to -5°C if it's dry and no wind
Anything below that is pretty cold, but I don't mind as long as it's not humid
Dry -15°C is nicer than humid and windy 2°C. I'm from the Northeast so I've always been used to it
20C koz Mom told so
Personally, it's more like -20C with a dry weather
I live in Southern France and same
Where is that for in the UK
In London it really never reaches 0, so I'd add 5 degrees to all of these
Wow, and to think that in Paris it rarely ever goes above 25
Where are you based
When you get over 40°C every summer now, you get happy with 24°C, trust me
You weren't lucky
It's quite rare to have negative temperatures in Paris or in western France
And no, oddly I like heat but I live in Britanny xD
Our flat is currently 16
2C, but our mezzanine bedroom is much warmer
Haven't even had the heating on today
Well I just wear more clothes I guess xD, but between April and September we have good temperatures
r/YUROP is leaking again
<3 (if only)
Oh people are waking up, protests are becoming bigger and more violent, but the cops just mutilate protesters and get away with it
Politicians basically then say that police violence doesnt exist in France
Its gonna take a bit of time but I feel theres gonna be something triggering a much bigger protest that's gonna turn into something more
Then
the guillotine lol

* I use the "warm" LED light bulbs at home, they have a light spectrum that mimics the one from the Sun's spectrum
Not sure how much it helps, but it feels agreeable to me
* I have some indoor hobbies, like recreational coding, cooking, etc
Being at 45 latitude, I feel not very impacted by the shorter days in winter, it feels mild relative to what they experience at 60 latitude
Hot chocolate, hot soups, warm blankets, heavy food
Winter is synonym of coziness and additionnal layers of fat for me
"Avoir des couilles" ( having some balls ) can mean being brave/audacious or a "real man" sometimes
In French it has the same signification as in English
But to say being bored we can say : "J'en ai plein le cul", which means "My ass is full".
And if you are exploring the latin american world, you have all the guevón, aguevonado, gueva,....
Balls may translate by either boules or couilles
Strangely there are not really interchangeable
Avoir des couilles, or alternatively être couillu, as you said, means being brave, being bold
There are other expressions like "poser ses couilles sur la table" ( literally to put one's balls on the table) which means to dare, to go to the limits
But also "en avoir plein les couilles" ( literally to have your balls full), which means to be fed up
Avoir les boules, to me, means more like to be frustrated, to be angry, but I checked the definitions, and yours (to be afraid) is also valid
I have never used it that way
You can also break balls (casser les couilles) to say someone or something is bothering you
Most complete description for the French
True I've forgotten this one
Love it
Sounds so childish it is actually cute
We used to say this also when I was a kid, in South West of France, totally forgot before reading you comment !
Edit : After investigation, it comes from the comedy movie « la tour Montparnasse infernale »
Live in France but next to Geneva, that's the best of both worlds
What is in the exciting cities, banks ?
For the presidential election, no
But for the mayor, yes
I love your political system in Switzerland
same in france ... declining and replace by vaping by youths but still a big thing (might be a bit less than germany but pretty similar)
"Only" 25% daily smokers in France where tobacco is very expensive, packs are all the same with horror pictures on it and its generally considered a very bad habit even though teenagers keep thinking it's cool
People in their 30s like me are desperately trying to quit
So forget the cliché.
Everyone knows it's bad, but everyone does it anyway
Related question: how common smoking electronic cigaret is in your country
Why I feel like I see personally is that a lot of young people are smoking cigarettes but the older generation has switched to vaping
Young people vape as well but I feel like that’s what I’ve noticed
Found some [figures] Apparently, 11% of the population in France smokes at least occasionally, and that proportion rises up to 32% for people aged 18 to 75
We still have the 4th highest proportion of smokers in Europe
If you rule elderly and young people out of the equation, I imagine it becomes a lot
Even 22% means 1 out of 5 person (including children and seniors) smokes
Edit: checked the numbers in France, it’s 11% over the whole population, but 32% for people between the age of 18 and 75
Quite a significant increase
well here in France a pack is 10€ so it is becoming very very expensive, while vaping you can have it on internet, with no nicotine for 4€/bottle
I am 23 and pretty much everyone I know smokes
I wish I had never started
Most people I know including me smoke Belgian tobacco, it still is 5€ when you cross the border
Same for me
Well in Paris you don't have that option only Chinese crap at 5€ but with anything else but tobacco
My wife is French, so that is the big thing
We married in the states and moved back after a few years
But what initially got me thinking about France was my aunt and uncle moved here before I was born and I learned to love France and Europe as a whole
I moved to France last year and would not dream of leaving
I've done a language program in Lyon and am now doing my Master in Paris
Plenty of things to see and do around the whole country, food is fantastic, and people have been warm and welcoming as opposed to their unfortunate (and clearly misplaced) stereotype
Travel is easy, cheap and convenient as well
And I have a lovely girlfriend here who I can't imagine leaving, we've made France our home
I can't yet speak of employment as I have only recently begun my job search but covid-19 has really stuck a nail into that for the moment
I would be open to living in other European countries, depending on employment opportunities, but unless I fall in love with them like I have with France I'll be looking to stay in beautiful France
You're a splendid story teller =)
I hope you'll enjoy France and what our country has to offer
Did you decide in which region you'll move yet
I hope you'll enjoy Paris but don't be discouraged if you don't, it is quite different to the province
After 10 years away, I moved back to France with my British husband and the one condition I had was to not move to Paris (I am not a fan and I knew he wouldn't like it there)
We're in the Vosges which is a pretty nice area for now
You might like Lille in the North, lovely city, very friendly people
Cool, which uni ?
Will you live in cité universitaire ? The one with crazy buildings
Please don't listen to this "french people are rude, they don't speak English" bullshit
A lot of foreigners actually complain that we switch to English too often
I wish you the best
It's seen as a big city yes with most jobs, I'd say of all European capitals London and Paris might be quite close in what they are
Supposedly the new Paris in France is Lyon
You could also try that
I haven't. I looked for a bit of nature after the big cities of China
It's a bit particular now but I love the fact that local farmers are so loved by the community where I am and how easy it is to get good, reasonably priced local products
People who say or write «viva la France».
«Viva» is freaking Spanish, in French it's «vive».
Tourists saying "France is so beautiful, I love France" but they've only been to Paris
Although being a compliment, generally it triggers most French outside Paris, and they will go like :
"You should come to Lozère, this is real France ! Not that filthy place filled with Parisians
Not saying Bonjour makes a french person automatically ruder
Omelette du fromage
The only "Italians" who care if you put cheese in your carbonara are Americans of italian descent
Asian people: NEITHER DID VIKINGS
Slovakia is Nagymagyarország change my mind
Yeah, many in France do that
When my family does, I'm always telling them to not say "hollandais" but "néerlandais".
Wait till you learn that the Netherlands are called "Hollandia" in Hungarian
I mean, Marie Curie and Chopin were French as well as Polish
> Marie Curie or Chopin were French
Oh yeah, if either of those are mentioned anywhere on Reddit the comments will be nothing but poles endlessly insulting France
I mean they both adopted the French nationality
By all accounts they *became* French and were French at the time of their death
Pretending they didn't is kind of insulting their life choices
>"Marie Curie or Chopin were French"
Sure they are lol
I wish I had enough money to buy you an award but take this instead
>	You absolutely have to queue
You can’t push in
You can leave a friend in a queue and go off for a bit, as long as you have made everyone else in the queue aware of what you’re doing so when you come back, they know you’re not pushing in
I want this in France
I hate when someone is doing the queue for all his friends / family
I've had many times Wiener Schnitzels in Vienna and they always asked if I wanted sauce
I think it's even harder for us because moreover flags are similar and the similarity between Slovakia and Slovenia is common in many languages while Austria/Australia is only struggling for English speakers
I think replacing the B with a P of Bretzel could come from Alscace in France
Here they got a language pretty close to german, but thet have an accent which replaces B with P.
They are both, they were immigrants and couldn't have achieved what they did without being both
It's unfair to forget about one country or the other
This is exactly what I'm saying lol don't they teach you at school where do Native Americans come from
Wait till they learn it means "the German Plain" lmao
Copying my answer to another comment :
> They offered me ketchup
I don't know if that's the issue but it was a Schnitzel inside some bread (Kaiser- something), so maybe they did it because it was sort of a sandwich
It was a small streed foot kind of meal, I was poor and a student
I mean I lived there but they might have thought so
They offered me ketchup
I don't know if that's the issue but it was a Schnitzel inside some bread (Kaiser- something), so maybe they did it because it was sort of a sandwich
It was a small streed foot kind of meal, I was poor and a student
Indeed, my bad
Alright yeah, that was it
It's still a schnitzel though isn't it
Of course they didn't taste exactly amazing as they were poor quality but I had to eat something
Haha can't remember but yeah that's the kind of place it was
we are the second biggest consumers of Mac Donald’s in the world after the United States
France’s longest border is with Brazil
Oh, wow, let's be twin countries
here in France people are sewing masks at home to gift them to those who care for the elderlies in nursing homes
I don't think you even know what is Fascist state
I'm from southern France and I think 10% is still too high
It's 5% at most
I'd wager something like 1-2%.
Even 10% is unrealistically high
The reality is nowhere near that
Maybe 1%. And foreign tourists do it much more than the French
Same with naturism, most naturists in French resorts are Dutch and German
Also France is one of the European countries where breastfeeding mothers are the most reluctant to breastfeed in public
I wouldn't be surprised if creepy male comments are the main reason for that
France is definitely well past its hippie phase
There are boobs on TV but not on the beach
1/3 for France is just insane
I've already spent weeks at the beach in summer without seeing any woman topless
From what I've seen, I'd say that even 5% would be a high number
1 out of 3 for France is completely ludicrous
1 out of 10 already seems pretty high to me
That's interesting, in France middle aged women are actually more likely to be topless than younger women are
Depends on the job really, my first job I was at 2200€/m but 50h/week on average
Then imagine it takes you 13 hours (I'm even exaggerating)
You would pay 60€ for each hour of construction
Unless you're super rich, that's at least twice your wage
There isn't a limit for the cadre status so yeah it's legal
Some status have a 35h weekly charge, but you can work more than that and there's a bonus
I think there's a limit for them
But for us, no, nothing
It's usually management positions
By law the standard is 35h.
If you work more you have more paid vacation and/or more pay up to a maximum but there are tons of condition around it so I won't translate it sorry :
You have technically no limit but full time was 39h, it's now 35h and it could have been 28h if the proposition was accepted
Basically above 35 hours per week you get 100% of your supposed wage
That's how it is here too, we get 1 or more days off a month
From my point of view, it's a very inappropriate behavior
I've got no issue with anything past Chaucer (Chaucer is actually quite pleasant due to the orthography being closer to Middle French)
Old English is just as obscure as Old Norse, Old German or Gothic to me as I'm not particularly trained with Germanic languages
Old english is closer to germanic langages
But then William the Bastard invaded England from France and was crowned king
He brought with him a lot of old French
That explains the gap between old english and middle and early modern english
I can understand Early modern and middle, and not all the words of Scots
Me reading the early modern English:
M'kay, i can almost read it perfectly without problems
Me reading the Old and Oldest English:
What
France is celebrating how they took over a prison to steal weapons
14th of July
When I was a kid in the 1980s, we would celebrate St John's day (la fête de la Saint Jean) with a huge bonfire on June 24
It was originally a pagan ritual to celebrate the harvest
However it seems to have completely disappeared
Every 8 december at night in my city (Lyon), everyone put some candles on our windows
The story:
\- 1643 the black plague arrived and people started to pray Mary to help them
It worked so they started to celebrate her every years to thanks her
\- 1852 they even made a huge golden statue of her, placed it on the basilique on the hill above the city and it was supposed to be inaugurate the semptembre 8th but the weather was bad
They tried again on the december 8th
Weather still bad, but they had wait enough and still put candles (luminions) on their windows
Now it's still celebrating, in private schools kids are making their own luminion each years
\- 1989: we started to illuminate all the city by creating the "fête des Lumières" (the light celebration) with light shows projected on buildings, music, light art in the streets and a big "merci Marie " or "Ave Maria", it depend, on the hill etc
first only that night and then it became so popular that it started to last 3 to 4 days and attract millions of people each year
=> just google "fete des lumieres, lyon".
Fun story : I was doing an internship in a Swedish primary school around Lucia time, and the students went to sing in several places in the neighborhood
When they went to sing in the retirement home, the gingerbread boys (who were dressed up in brown to imitate gingerbread) were distributing candies to the elders
One of the elders who either had a good sense of humor or didn't have all of her head, tried to bite one of the gingerbread boys
Former President François Hollande [
I'd say our former president François Hollande in this [discours aux Philippines] said the worst
But Emmanuel Macron said something like "your wife is delicious" to someone very important
A very famous terrible English sentence by former prime Minister Raffarin about the European constitution [link]
It was used as lyrics for a satirical song when he has dismissed, in the style of [Cobain's last days ]
François Hollande with Elon Musk
EDIT : this one is great too : [
PM Raffarin will be hard to beat
You can not beat our former president of the Republic, François Hollande
Well, i can't imagine better for Tirol
How about some classic Raffarin
"Because you can be do what you want to do"
Beautiful ️
This
There are longer versions of speeches in India, but these few seconds are enough to understand the extent of the problem
That's exactly what popped immediatly in my mind lol
It became a meme in France just after the speech
Iconic !
Hahaha I had forgotten about this, I was going to offer [this]
He speaks very good French though
He still sounds the same
I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this
Raffarin is an old time classic now
I love how self-confident he looks while saying that
Same, it's literally the first thing that came to my mind when I read the OP
Pls stop saying that i'm old it hurts
Surement une question de génération
Hollande m'est directement venu en tête (j'ai 21 ans), alors que Raffarin
Kids in France are forced to learn english and do not have the option of refusing
French kids are required to spend years learning English
Besides the collaboration with Nazi Germany of then government of France in the second world war or the colonization and enslavement of people from Africa, i don't quite see
Algeria war I suppose
France at the time did not consider Algeria as a colony but as a part of mainland France since there was no Algeria before we went there (it was a place where various local clans lived from attacking European ships and selling their passengers into slavery)
As a result the government of the time was adamant that even if France lost all its colonies Algeria would remain french since for them Algeria was France
When a pro independence movement called FLN started blowing up shit left and right to force France to give them a referendum France reacted by sending troops with the objective of « bringing back order ». The troops sent there were composed of a core of hardened paratroopers who tended to be very nationalistic and of young conscripts who were not sure what they were doing there
Ensued a years long campaign against an insurgency where French army controlled  the countryside during the day and the FLN controlled it during the night
Villages which helped the French were therefore slaughtered and razed during the night and the villages which helped the FLN were slaughtered and razed during the day
The more violent one side became and the more violent the other side became
At some point napalm starting being used by France under the name « special barrels » because since it was officially still an operation to keep order in a French département they really couldn’t tell the public that they were going to such extremes
In 1958 De Gaulle is elected and decides that enough is enough and organizes a referendum calling Algerian people, mainland French people and oversea French people to vote
The result are overwhelmingly positive with 75% of voters voting in favour of auto determination for Algeria
Vichy
Most people would say Vichy or WW2 collaboration
I would however take a reminder that the French Army was sometimes ruthless during the napoleonic era
There is a famous date in Spanish history :  ***El tres de mayo de 1808 en Madrid
***
Basically, when the french occupied Spain in 1808, insurgents tried to fight back
This resistance was repressed in the blood
While many spanish citizen died fighting the french army during this episode,  patriotics and resistants prisoners where then massacred by the french army during the "Tres de Mayo", the 3 May 1808, for no other reason than to send a message to the population
It's worth noticing the uprising was not that huge and popular in the first place
The slaughter of the citizens and resistants on Tres de Mayo backfired hard, and would later encourage the spanish people to fight even more and harder against the french, who were now seen as cruels and evil, where they were tolerated occupants at first
&#x200B;
And there is Massacre de la Saint-Barthélémy,  St
Bartholomew's Day massacre, les Guerres de vendées
Well
We had our fair share of citizens slaughter
Lots of things
Let's start with the Revolution
Robespierre killed all his opponents
Napoléon Bonaparte was a bloodthirsty dictator, but for some reason he's still viewed as a national hero
The colonial empire, that allowed to keep some form of slavery despite the Constitution
WW1
WW2, Philippe Pétain and the deportations
The Indochina War, that led to the Vietnam War
The Algeria War
Nuclear tests in Polynesia and Algeria
Forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people, which was a regular thing at least until the 1990s. Refugees being locked up in "centers" (more like Russian style prisons), both adults and kids, before being deported by force to their death in Iraq / Afghanistan / whatever
I probably forgot to include a few more things, sadly
>The Triangle Slave trade
Almost every western European nation did it
I didnt even had heard about it before, yikes
It's bad but 'OP' asked for "most horrible atrocities" so i don't believe it's scale up to the other example i gave
And during the Sainte Barthélemy
Most of our protestants went in Germany after that
Where we should start
We might be the champion of shitty ugly messed-up decolonization processes
The colonies, the slave trade, fucking over Indian tribes in America, I dunno
I know the feeling
There might be some idiom but « avoir le seum » comes to my mind
It’s slang but also kinda common amongst youths and young adults and means that you are frustrated by some thoughts or unfortunate outcomes
Grasse matinée. (Fat morning)
In France, you just stay in bed slowly drinking your coffee or what ever
Read a book, or make love
Then, you get drunk at 'aperitif' time (noon), or not
We usually call it "blues du dimanche soir" or "déprime du dimanche soir".
Чёрт is outdated ?
Ah yeah "blues du dimanche soir" sounds right somehow
Nah, I know our litterature has made a lot ouf of this word but ennui is just boredom in common french
La Transhumance- basically a Provençal (Mediterranean coast of France) tradition
Two times a year, the sheep are led in the mountains and back, in summer
They are led through the Provençal cities, you can see the roads flooded by sheep
There is traditional music and costumes, eating and stuff
_We want our Ratatouille back
It's a traditional dish around here
Fête du Roi de l’Oiseau
It is basically a renaissance festival with costumes and dancing and food but the whole town of Le Puy is involved and it is very fun
It is from the 16th century, so not quite ancient but it is still a main event every September for 5 days
Definitely the Épiphanie (6th of January, where we eat "galette des rois" which is an absolutely tasteful pie with almonds and somewhere in the pie is hidden a little figurine, and the person who gets it will get a crown), we also have Chandeleur (6th of February, that's the day of crêpes) and Saint-Nicolas (6th of December, which is only celebrated in the Northeast of France and surrounding regions abroad and it's a kind of pre-Christmas where (according to the legend) the brother of Santa Claus comes to your house and gives you candy if you were wise during the year, while his mad brother will give your parents a stick of wood to beat their children if they weren't wise -- of course it's just to affray the children and no one does it for real)
I also like how it's all on the 6th of something
I'm just forgetting the traditional egg hunt on Easter Day but I think that's pretty common
Do you celebrate something related to Attila too
I had the chance of celebrating Līgo back in 2014
It was awesome
The Finno-Ugric seems pretty accurate, as I know pretty good the bases of Hungarian I just started to learn Finnish and it seems much easier, there's the same system of cases, the same way to express the possession (no verb for to have but a periphrase with to be) and some similar words (menni/mennä seems to be the best example)
Hi, I'm a French person who doesn't eat cheese or drink wine
A French who can't be grumpy, ever
A French that is satisfied with the government
I have a French friend who doesn't eat cheese
I'm a french that doesn't eat cheese
I'm french and guess what ?
I don't like Paris !
A French that doesn't complain
Vegan French dude here️ I feel this is a job for me
A French person who doesn’t like bread would be even worse !
C'est tellement tragique
tu sais, si tu rencontres des problèmes en ce moment, tu peux en parler
Il n'est jamais trop tard Teproc
Yeah that’s terrible
If I was told I would have to never eat cheese ever again I would probably lose the will to live
I don't like cheese either, but in a truly french way, I compensate with copious amounts of wine
Believe me, we are at least 10
Truly unthinkable
A french person who doesn't like Nutella would be wild
Mais tellement
Le fromage c'est la vie comme dirait l'aut'.
People support them when they are in their best interests
When paid leave got created in 1936 no one demonstrated
I'll be glad to great you too in English:)
And I'll be happy to help if you need to talk to non English speaker
now don't go too far
I prefer Nocciolata !
French person who prefers peanut butter here ! And la Chocolade
And I don't like bread either, btw
I don’t. It’s garbage
Rather eat straight butter on my bread
We just eat a lot of it
I mean
a LOT
Le bon fromage si on en mange souvent ça peut revenir cher quand même
Ça m’arrêtera pas d’en manger mais bon
Nope
Not as much in the UK for example
Bread really is a big part of our food culture
Yes, there are a lot of countries where there’s a big bread culture
Die Sonne : Le Soleil
Der Mond : La Lune
It's reversed for us
The opposite of you : Moon is female and Sun is male
Now that I am thinking about it, maybe it is because of our far greek/latin heritage
In these cultures, Moon had a godDESS who was Selene but the Sun had a GOD who was Appolo
Maybe this is the reason why
It seems to correspond to Appolon, greek god of the sun, and Artemis, greek godess of the moon
Earth being female and sky being male might be related to Gaia and Ouranos
And the Taoist concept of Yin/Yang put the Moon and women on the Yin side as opposed to sun and men on the yang side
Hahaha depends if it's Greek or Roman I think
I'd go with 1871-1914, maybe because that was the comeback from hell
1871 => Paris is revolting and is anarchist, Germany occupy more than a third of the country for a few years, repayment of war which were the highest to ever happen (at that point in time), loss of the most industrious region, humiliation in Versailles and complete diplomatic isolation
1914 => Second biggest and richest Empire on the Planet, stable internal situation with amazing social progress comparatively to most of the planet, a solid alliance with Russia and a decently solid one with the UK (which was a millennium long opponent, so no small deal that one alliance), insane cultural influence on the world stage (most of your cliché on Paris and France are from that era), industrialization going smoothly despite the lack of resources compared the UK or Germany, scientifically comparable to the top dogs with a ton of "great scientist", and the quality of living was rising sharply
It ended in the worst way possible though
It depends your definition of golden age
Some might say something like 16th to 18th century, but I'd say *Les trente glorieuses* (the glorious thirty)
The period of economic growth between the 40s and 60s.
We've never been this close again from full employment etc
If we go with italy as a concept, I guess your roman empire was not too bad of a golden age either
Oh you guys use Grosso modo too ?
Neat to know
Wait has the french history curriculum changed in the last decade
I remember there having been 3 periods described as a "golden age" in french historiography:
- 1180 to 1314 which encompassed the reign of the "Three Great Direct Capetians" (Philip Augustus, Saint Louis and Philip the Fair): our medieval golden age and rise as the wealthiest and most powerful christian kingdom following the Battle of Bouvines in 1214
- The "Grand Siècle" or "Great Century" (the 17th century)
we were freshly out of the french wars of religion, huguenots rebellions crushed under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, weakening of the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years' War and France's rise to the top once again as Europe's greatest power during Louis XIV's long reign
- The First French Empire (1803-1812)
No explanation needed
France emerged as Europe's greatest power in all those periods
politically, culturally and militarily speaking that is
Socially (as in life for the people living in France during those periods), I don't know if the average Frenchman saw any improvment in his day to day life due to said golden ages but I remember having read a great famine hitting the country twice during the reign of Louis XIV though and a shit load of people dying
So it must not have been all that "glorious" for the commoners lol
There was the "Belle Époque" you talked about as well (1871-1914)
Life improved greatly for the people, high industrialization, progressivism, art, science, culture
all flourished
But we were no longer the top dogs by that point
The British Empire and the German Empire were above us on the power spectrum
even the US in some ways (industrial output and economy) was ahead of us
and Russia was rapidly industrializing as well
So I don't know if you can call that a golden age
I don't personally
I can't describe any period in which France isn't n°1 but below other european powers, rivals such as the UK and Germany nonetheless, as a "golden age". Embarrassing
lmao
Also, the times of Louis XIV
Like
Ok it was a monarchy, but France was kind of the ultimate boss, especially in terms of arts, at the time
For the same reason, the 19th century before the 1870 war
Yup it was the first republican experiment for France that didn’t end in another revolution or a coup d’état
Probably the period that really anchored what France was about and which paved the way for what it is today
I just googled it and it seems that it's Latin, but I always thought it was French AND informal
I mean yeah sure, we weren't the big bully of Europe, but I put more emphasis on the whole :
> high industrialization, progressivism, art, science, culture
all flourished
Than the ability of France to kick yet another coalition ass (those time make for fascinating moment/story though)
Too many war for Louis XIV and too unstable for before the 1870 war for my taste, but I see why one could defend those two
I didn't express myself very well in the precedent post, sorry, I meant to say that France *owned* more than anyone but the UK, France had a quarter of the world capital (iirc the UK had a bit more than 30%)
Most of the revenue came from France owning massive amount of other countries industry, for example most of the Russian railway and a decent chunk of their arms manufacturers of the time was built on French fund
(It was also thanks to this massive capital that France managed to stay in the war economically speaking
France owned a lot of American industry for example meaning from the get-go France production for the war was split into multiple area and that France could mobilize a greater portion of it's population without destroying it's industry
I chose my words poorly before, again sorry
Sure but France never dominated the continent in such a fashion before
in fact nobody did what Napoleon did in Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire
The only thing close to it until that was Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire
Ok this shit is getting quite hilarious
The Italians are even making things up to be mad about now regarding the French
Who the hell hails France as the heir of Rome
I've only heard such statements come from the British online (and rarely enough for it to not be considered a big deal)
There have been some historians who drew a parallel between France and Rome on one side with England/Britain and Carthage on the other to describe their rivalry and that's about it
> Many in Europe referred to Great Britain as "Perfidious Albion", suggesting that it was a fundamentally untrustworthy nation
People compared Britain and France to ancient Carthage and Rome, respectively, with the former being cast as a greedy imperialist state that collapsed, while the latter was an intellectual and cultural capital that flourished
A little quote from "That Sweet Enemy" by Tombs in reference to the anglo-french rivalry:
> The republicans knew as well as the Bourbons that British control of the oceans weighed in Continental power politics, and that France could not dominate Europe without destroying Britain
"Carthage"—vampire, tyrant of the seas, "perfidious" enemy and bearer of a corrupting commercial civilization—contrasted with "Rome", bearer of universal order, philosophy and selfless values
>not even France, as they claim they are
Lol what
No one claims that
It seems that we're living rent free in your head however
Well, names are often adapted to the local language, so that particular critic is not really valid (we say Jules Cesar, and not Julius Caesar for instance)
France was big on church stuff at some point also,but it had nothing to do with the Roman empire, which for us is definitely an Italian empire
Damn Elisa
You need to chill sister
Haha What the hell is the deal with Italians
Reading posts and comments here and r/europe made me realize so many of you seem to have a problem with us and it's absolutely hilarious because of how one-sided the whole thing is
You guys even manage to see the French "stealing" from Italy in instances as ridiculous as this
lol
I guarantee you that nobody considers any of the people you listed to be French
Their names have simply been "frenchified" as it is done in many other languages
You probably have many french historical figures whose names have been adapted to the italian language as well (Joachim Murat for example
Not too sure)
Calling Julius Ceasar "Jules César" or Leonardo da Vinci "Léonard de Vinci" isn't us trying to make them French, neither are the Germans calling french kings (named Louis or Charles) "Ludwig" and "Karl" trying to make them Germans
WTF
Oh by the way "Eldest Daughter of the Church" (or also "Most Christian King" as one of the many titles of the kings of France) is a title which has been given to the Kingdom of France by the Papacy, iirc
I do know we can have our obnoxious moments but yeah
turns out the French weren't completely a bunch of rude arrogant assholes with delusions of grandeur
A couple of people outside of France also thought we were pretty cool lmao
Are italians this sensitive
Those are just translated names calm down
Why wouldn't you
Filthy offspring of the Perfidious Albion
Pretty badass description tho I agree lol
>Eh yes, a lot of french redditors say “we don’t care about italians
I mean it is true
This rivarly our two countries apparently have is really one sided
People don't really think about Italy this side of the alps
Or have any strong opinions about it
Most people like the food and the architecture
Of course people notice similarities and will think about the italianw as "cousins"but that's about it
Fair point about the stolen art, I suppose you should focus on it instead of the Mona Lisa
And I won't approve of anything created by that goblin, Sarkozy
But you're not alone, it seems the Spanish think more about us than we do and the same goes for the english
>The problem is that you still claim to be (even if you don't say it, you think it cause you have been a superpower and your economy is pretty strong)
As I said rent free
No politician is claiming that and I've never known anyone who claimed that
Obviously in the past, yes like most european coutries as you said
But currently nah, hell the french government has been pushing the "our gaulish ancestors" narrative for decades now
>it's absolutely hilarious because of how one-sided the whole thing is
That's the problem
If this is one-sided, you should have ignored both of them, and avoid the unnecessary condescending tone
You did waste your time
I have come accross many of Elisa's comments here before and I've never had any altercation with her prior to this because at least her other complaints were reasonably coherent (italian stuff France looted during wars throughout the ages or political matters like Libya)
The whole name thing baffled me that much yes as did the claim to be the heir of Rome
that's why I decided to answer
My goal wasn't to be condescending and if that's the way it appeared, my dearest apologies
The laughter and "WTF
" moment I was having reading her comment and trying to answer to it may have been transmitted through my reply lol
Did she seriously call me Jean Paul instead of Pierre or Antoine
Pfff
Disappointed
See if you had brought up the Gioconda, italian stuff France looted, Corsica or whatever, I would have just had the habitual hearty chuckle and moved on
The name thing is the most ridiculous and hilarious of all the complaints I've heard so far but hey whatev's.
Oh and a little advice cousins
Just so you know
You'll have to try a bit harder if you want to kick off an actual rivalry between us, not that lightweight stuff you've been doing so far lol
Taking a page out of England or Germany's book and invading us to take your stuff back could be a good start or having the audacity to pull that shit you pulled in 2006 ever again hahaha
Good, translating names is a very common practice
Good to see it's just that one person getting weirdly angry at normal things
>It seems that you want to make pass them as french
Nah I'm pretty sure we just translated names
>(like that idiot controversy about leonardo da vinci, though i know it wasn’t a serious thing)
The average guy knows they’re italian, but with a french name it sounds subconsciously like if they were french, **somehow**.
Yes, because they're translated
>Maybe we should change french names too, Voltèro sounds so good
Sure, go do that
It was bought by Francis I. It is a well known fact in France
It is rightful french property, so is Corsica, which was bought from Genoa and pacified
Maybe not you, but I came accross the occasional wild italian who includes both in his list of "stuff France stole from Italy", that's why I listed them
Anyway, I think I'll end my contribution to the circus here lol
Have a great evening
I mean you knida imagined that translating italian names in french was some sort of nefarious plot to claim famous italians as french so I'd describe that as kinda weird but alright
A friend and I went to Italy a few years ago
We decided to rent an Airbnb in Genova to be in the city center
The owner came to meet us at the train station and we walked to the place
Maybe a hundred meters from the flat, he stops, looks at me and say in English "now you walk fifty meters behind me and pretend you don't know me
They are supposed to know I rent this flat". It was his friends flat
We were not to do any noise in the flat, on the 7th floor of the building (with no lift
), We could use the giant terrace at night and not talk to the neighbors
We spent our three nights barely sleeping because we thought someone would come and kick us out
Plus, Italians were not the friendliest and Milano at night was scary
I didnt look at the reviews so it's kinda my fault, but once in Madrid i booked an hôtel, the receptionnist didnt spoke english and she used Google translate to check me in (wtf)
Then i she showed my room which was like at the end of the road from the reception
Inside was gross, the sheets weren't changed
The other people there looked ok at first and not mean or anything but damn judging by their faces i wouldnt be surprised it they took drugs ( and the neighbourhood was full or drug addicts
) And also we couldnt close the door ?? So like everybody could come inside say a hi during a night
Needless to say i didnt slept there at all, huge waste of money though
And when i wanted to check out the next day, the receptionnist wasnt there on time, i waited like 30mn and an other client check me out
Fucking hell
I was so angry at myself to not have been carefull enough
Sadly our hospital are most of the time in overwhelmed, if you got something like this happening again, try to call the 15 if it's urgent, it's sadly the only fast option
I hope you where able to find some pleasure at least in our country
There are several public hospitals in Paris that are open 24/7
They can't legally close
Even when striking, they can't stop working
I don't think you went to an ER
It sounds like you tried going to clinics, which aren't ERs
Shut up or he'll start insulting you as well
Let a Norwegian do the job
In my city, two drunk guys kidnapped a Lama from a circus and paraded it around in the tramway
They called him Serge the Lama (after one of our singers who's called Serge Lama)
In my city we had the original "he bought a PS4 by weighting it in the fruit section".
He came back the day later to do it again but he was caught
You now have a new goal, a higher calling
When buying fruits / vegetables in bulk, you weigh them in the store and the scale prints a price barcode to put on the bag with the produce, and that get scanned at checkout
The guy put such a barcode on the PS4, and scanned it at the self-checkout: so he bought a PS4 for the price of a bunch of fruits
Usually, there are employees making sure it doesn't happen, but he managed to get through this time
But they saw him later on camera, and when that moron came back to do it again
he was caught
Yeah, it's usually the case in France too but I guess in not all supermarkets then ...
As a French
Only places I can think of would be Britanny
But most of the country gets absolutely overrun with tourists (even the Massif Central) every year
Maybe the Pyrenees when it's not skiing season
Basically inner France except Paris and the southeast
Sure Provence is good but invaded by tourists in the summer, except a few areas in the Provençal highlands
The Pyrenees, the massif central region and the less populated departments' prefectures are a great place to visit, most of it isn't targeted by tourists
Edit : I mean in summer season
So traveling alone in Sicily without being able to speak Italian is actually safe
Been tempted to do that for a while
My thoughts exactly
Tourists-free places are so rare, we really shouldn't ruin them by exposing them on the Internet
Okay, thanks for the tips
Especially the cathedral and its famous 123-metre spire
Russian - not the most used language but because it is rare, you will be in high demand
Better to operate in a pool with less competition
German would probably be most useful here, in addition to French (obviously number 1 priority if you work in France) and English
One of the biggest trading partner
Working in banks in France, I've encountered more german and italian than any other languages
Spanish just after
We definitely speak English with all of them though
Regarding russian that is often mentioned in this thread : never encountered anything related to Russia in my experiences so I'll say that if you work in banks, you don't have to care about learning russian
Except maybe if you work in private Banking sector with those rich russians that are many in Paris to spend their cash and be safer that if they stayed in Russia
Probably spanish, since it is spoken in the majority of south america
French is also useful if you want to work in Africa since it is spoken a lot there
That's not a reason not to learn the language of the country you're working in
Russian
Not really sure about this
One more vote for Russian - because not many people speak it compared to English/German/French, you will have less competition and be in higher demand
German is much, much easier than any Romance language for a native English speaker
I'm learning Hungarian and I just started Finnish uwu
I encountered the styrian Dialekt when I went to österreich
Man ….
"I hob es nie gmocht" I heard
Couldn't even guess what was behind that sentence without the hochdeutsch translation … And I even speak some german …
Was surprised nobody really spoke English in that area though, especially when in France, we think that we are the shittiest English speakers and everywhere else everyone is 100% fluent
I had to use my completely rusty German but I managed o/
We probably will not need to speak chinese during our life
Chinese soft power doesn't really exist and very very few people learn mandarin outside China
The ratio between native speakers and outsiders learning their language is very very low compared to English, French and Spanish
They will all learn English before we will all learn mandarin
95% of speakers are in Russia and Ukraine
It’s rare outside the countries where it’s spoken natively
Ah ok
And no, here it'd be rather German
I guess I'm not convinced German grammar is so much more complex than French or even Spanish grammar, that the huge vocabulary advantage you get from learning a language within your linguistic family is offset by that
Granted, English has a fair amount of Romance influence through French, but still
It's actually cool if you're involved in it you know
Many people think like you while they never heard a single word in Hungarian, Finnish or Estonian
I find these languages very pretty
I was in Kindberg and there nobody spoke english I met
They were mostly indeed 40 or smth
But the pharmacian I saw there was smth like 25-30 and didn't as well
But yeah, in Graz, young ppl I talked with were speaking english
If you plan to work in tourism or with China's companies, yes
Otherwise it's not important
I may be influenced by my personal work, but working in the financial sector you don't need at all to speak chinese since you'll never encounter chinese things
Except if you work in HK of course (which is currently in a good way of losing its status btw)
Except if you have a business that has some factories in China, it's probably better to learn German or Spanish in the EU than mandarin
Also, the chinese market is huge compared to nearly all countries, but it's only one country, against a whole "cultural world" we call "the west" with the EU and USA where english is the standard
Also, the soft power there is 150 234 092x (according to a study based on a survey on 1 person, me) more powerful than the chinese one
> you definitely can't deny the potential for Mandarin to be the lingua franca
Well, for now, there is no sign of it
Chinese culture doesn't export and since the rise of the economic power of China it has been as a mimic to the western (american) culture
Also with the political system there, it doesn't attract much westerners except those who wants to do business
Which may still change regarding the usual growth pattern which is high as long as you are behind the "norm" of the rich countries
China's growth will lower too
Also, the language is completely different with another alphabet so not too much ppl would want to learn it
People struggle already learning german, so mandarin …
At the moment, nothing suggest that this may change in the near future
China is a big country with a big economy, but the "west" is still bigger in every way
Especially regarding the soft power which is more important than economy for the spread of the language
The current most useful language, yes
And we don't need it that much
Besides, learning it at a proficient level is one of the first steps to assimilation and that's not going to happen
Ask some Dutch, Swedes, even the Britons themselves because that has little to do with them anymore
>because of the british
Because of the Americans
Until the next one
Do you think she'd agree to help me
Thank you for your input, it's interesting
>I had experiences and travelled through France, it’s not about politics it’s about living in a world where not everyone knows french
It's about living/working/visiting a country named France where everyone should know a bit of French
These are our lands, our culture, our rules
Tourists need to adapt to it, and not the other way round
If you're not pleased with this, you can go and visit somewhere else, the world is vast
May I get her username please
Okay no problem it's just I've be looking for weeks to find someone that could help me :/
- Danish is the butt joke of every jokes about languages up in the North
- That sink cabinet thing that only exists in Finland and Italia
- While teaching English in pretty much almost every non-English-speaking countries, Dora teaches Spanish in Romania
One time someone asked about what one could do in their city, and a German person's answers was at least 5 paragraphs long (with bullet points)
Belgium roads (at least in Wallonia) are worse than the roads in northern Italy
But they will say at least their highways are illuminated, and that if in France this is not the case, it is because we think we are brights
(I don’t know if it is the best translation of their joke, and if it make sense in English
A party and a cake with candles on it and that's it
Everyone awkwardly sings happy birthday while you're blowing out the candles, and if you're unlucky someone knows happy birthday in another language and it lasts even longer (ex: French and English, sometimes German)
The cake and the gifts are the only things that separates a birthday party from a regular party
I live at the border and everytime I go to Belgium I see those big ass signs saying "xxx deaths on walloon roads this year" yeah YOU DON'T SAY
Have you *seen* your roads
Nah not Paris
Hmmm
I'm used to hear people making fun of french stereotypes and of the french accent but not the language itself
Anyway I kinda agree, spanish or italian and even English sounds soo much better than french (it's a bit monotone I think)
That joke made me laugh a lot at least !
Who is the most hated person in your country's history ?
In France, it would probably be Phillipe Pétain or Pierre Laval, both collaborated during the occupation in WW2 and are seen as traitors
Some diehard nationalists like my cousins really like Pétain for some reason
Maréchal Pétain who was the French president during the Nazi invasion
He basically just instaured antisemite and nazi laws and is who I personally think of first when the word “collabo” (French slang for collaborator) comes up
Edit: didn’t see the description of the question lol but yeah it was already mentioned haha
Klaus Barbie also !
Harald Schumacher
On a more serious note, Harald Schumacher
No seriously, Marechal Petain, probably
Typical French rise and fall story
I am not sure Pétain is the most hated (due to the WW1)
I find that really interesting that you guys don’t like Éamon De Valera
As the first president (I think that’s correct but not 100% sure) you’d think he was popular
Could you explain the hate pls
ni oubli ni pardon
I never knew about the shootings, only the bombing
It wasn't know to me until I saw Netflix's 22 July which is a good movie
The meme is even better considering that his name literally means "of the hole"
He didnt really have a chance to begin with
This
I may receive a lot of hate by the brits for this but having seen many of his interviews, he does come out as impulsive and very confrontational (and difficult to deal with) but he makes a lot of correct points and debates in a fair way compared to some Americans who basically rely on fallacies
I'd rather have Piers than a 'yes-sir' kind of TV figure who doesn't contest anything that's being said in a morning talk show for the sake of following a boring repetitive protocol
Wow ok that’s very in depth thanks a lot for the clarification
My favorite one is when he condescendingly asked someone to "give the Pythagorean theorem to the fifth digit
Also, the one where he interviews Ricky Gervais and thinks that he's going to heaven because he's a "good catholic boy", and he doesn't understand why Gervais ain't afraid of death
French grammar & conjugaison is not the easiest one
But i know few people that have learned it and make it super hard to spot they are not French native
Some others (like my spanish mum) could change their accent but didn't and that's fine too
&#x200B;
So i would say not impossible, but hard to get and probably useless, as we do like foreign accents ... at least i do !
I guess it's possible with some work
My mother lived in France for a bit of time now, but she always had an almost undistinguishable accent, and had an even better French than some natives
Very hard
You can usually tell if a person is not a  native french speaker even if they speak very good french and don't make close to grammar mistakes
The accent still betrays
One thing for americans usually is that their "R" sound is SUPER insistant even when they speak french very well
Like "Garçon" becomes "GaRRRçon".  Or the "é" sounds like in the end of "retrouvé" (to find) sounds more like "aay" for native english speakers
You do have a lot of them, but honestly who cares ? As long as people can understand you, keep your accent, it sounds hot :)
There are a few exceptions though
Like Jodie Foster (who went to a french school/high school) speaks pristine french
Like she sounds 100% like a parisian, you really need an extensively long interview with her in french to spot some grammar spots here and there such as misgendering a noun to think "Oh yeah", but it's very slight
I also had a friend from eastern europe who, when I met her, lived in France for like 2 years at most, and she spoke also pristine french
No accent whatsoever, I couldn't believe her when she told me she was not from France
That’s a good thing you try to encourage people who are trying to learn your language
It’s really important
In France when someone is trying to speak French and does the slightest mistake someone will be there to mock him or make him understand that his French is bad
It is really annoying because people don’t want to even try to speak it because of it
It’s already difficult enough to learn it (even French natives make mistakes)
Sorry for my English
Yeah our aeiou are quite guttural
My Spanish mum never managed a clean U It was always a OU
My polish fiancé is also struggling
I keep on saying it's fine but their self expectations generates frustrations
How would you compare french conjugaisons vs English ? And I'm talking about all of them not the casual ones .
How about that any noun must be feminine or masculine
Which is beyond rational for objects
Our 10s of ways to have the same sound ( or é ei ai ...) Noir trying to make French the hardest language in the world but I'm happy to be french learning English rather than the other way around
So you speak like a native french with a cold and nose full
Congratulations
English spelling doesn't make any sense and it's pretty hard to know when use which tense
If think these are the main difficulty of English
That's how I tend to say it with a flue :)
Lol, no
We already have a 35-hour work week and it's a curse
I assure you that French 35-hour work week is NOT working fine
Hum, As a French I d like to thank the German for burrying the war hatchet after more or less 200 years of war
I like how we are kind of best  buddies right now, with Merkel and macron seemingly working hand in hand after years and years of senseless  hatred
Cheers, und ein kebab mit alles  bite :)
I'd like to thank the US for the invention of Blues, Jazz and Rock n' roll, the world would suck without American music
Scotland for being our ally since more than 700 years, and for its army helping (sometimes saving) us mutiple times in our battles against England (isn't it beautiful to be linked by hate for England ? Haha)
The United States for helping us during WWI _and_ WWII, and being an historic ally since the XVIIIth century even though our politic views are often very different
Also, for their amazing music and movies
The UK for being an ally who sacrificed their people in WWI and WWII in France despite the fact that we were ennemies since a millennium
Italy for their awesome food and their breathtaking pieces of art that we love and admire greatly here
Hungary for simply existing because else I couldn't lernen their language
Thank you Spain for allowing us to come in holiday in your country year after year even if we (especially the youth) are terrible tourists
Same here :)   Even if it must be weird to go to your local hospital, pass out there and to wake up in a hospital room with everyone talking german XD
Thanks for the comeback a few years later !
You can also come in the winter ! Our ski resort are cool too :)
Love you too Germany
It took great men and women to put all that history behind us, and people of our generation tend to forget how incredible it is to be able to live in long term peace with our neighbours
I am old enough to have some great-grand-parents to lived through both wars (especially one side who lived in Lorraine)
One day we tried to take one of my great-grand mother to Germany for a day trip, for her it was just impossible as the fear and resentment was just too strong even 60 years later
That day I realised how far we've come nowadays
Wir lieben auch Deutschland ! I think Germany is our biggest ally since quite a long time now :)
Ich liebe Deutschland !
We have a strong bond as countries, and you're our best friend on the international scale
First of all, I agree
We love to shit on each other all the time but in the end we are best friends
Secondly, there is no way to anger a french better than saying Viva la France
Viva is Spanish, in french it's Vive
> But also screw you for not teaching your kids English
We do, everybody is just really self-conscious about their accent
Also, sorry Spain
We welcome you with open arms :)
May I recommend Nice, by the sea, only 45min from ski resorts, best of french and Italian food,  and great  for engineering (not nice itself but around)
That s where I hope to go living after my PhD
And how did you thanked us ?? By partying like madman on the champs elysee after Eder s goal in 2016
My heart is still bleeding
I was in Faro this summer : amazing
Fun fact, France was sometimes called “the second homeland of jazz”, and in Shanghai the French concession was _full_ of jazz clubs
(Which were run by the Green Gang, a mafia who also sold drugs in these clubs, but hey: nobody’s perfect
No need to be super old for that :) My great grandfathers both thought both wars (except one of them was a Hungarian -and an Austro-Hungarian prior), plus one of my grandfathers fought in WW2, and I’m only 20
Some of my friends are in the same situation
Plus, I think we might be more likely to have mixed origins (French and Hungarian for me, plus English and Italian but those are more distant)
And we travel more than ever, which helps some of us realize how awesome the EU is
So, yeah, we know how important and awesome peace is
Boua, most of the wars between us had no good and bad side, and for the last one  the vichy regime  collaborated thoroughly so we are not all white either
But now all is good
And thanks for the beers
Fourcade is so awesome though so it s easy, but now comes the reign of Boe
Yeah, there was a time when Jazz smelled like danger, it was mostly played in brothels for a long time
To be honest, even tough Lafayette is almost considered as a hero (I've learnt recently that you have not one but _several_ cities named Lafayette ?), he is very controversial in France (debates about if he was good or bad)
His actions during the French revolution (with the Champ de Mars massacre and his constant defense of the monarchy) and the Restoration (after Napoleon I) are not well percieved here
He was even sentenced as "Traitor of the Nation" during the Revolution
That's why he always loved and missed the US
But he's also an important figure of French history
What a life he lived ! He met Washington, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette (who hated him), Danton, Napoleon I, Monroe, Franklin ; he participated in the American Revolution, _two_ French Revolutions and the reign of Napoleon
He lived until his 70s, so old at that time
I don't know for the US, but in France his surname is "The hero of two worlds". A complex but very interesting figure !
Well I love going to austra in summer, plenty if 3000m summit for long days of hiking and not so many tourist
So perfect
(Same of Suisse but more expansive)
Italians are very gifted when it comes to music
I didn't know that :o thanks !
You're welcome :D
I'm speaking from experience, my great-grandad was an Italian immigrant from Varese, and he played guitar (I have his old guitar) in local bars in Alsace, he was quite popular
:) I'm a guitar player myself, so I like to think I perpetuate a tradition
As a French person, I'd say that we can vaguely understand most European language, as many words resembles their French equivalent
It's not like we'd understand a full sentence though
Concerning Swiss, Quebec, Belgium etc, they all have at least a part of the country which speaks French, but with some small difference, so yeah I think we understand each other pretty good
I dont know about Romania though, I personally don't understand that language, and I've seen people saying that it's closer to Italian, so I'd say that we don't understand but other people might
>France/French Canada (Québec)/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland
Yes to all
If there is a heavy accent it may require more focus from me but if the other guy does not speak too fast it's totally understandable with a few variations in vocabulary
French can understand without problem Quebecois, Swiss French and Belgian French
The only thing we wouldn't understand is some slang that we do not share, and sometimes a word or two because of the Quebecois accent
But all in all we've got absolutely 0 problem understanding each other
I mostly understand people from Quebec (except very rural parts of it with a strong accent)
I understand French-speaking Swiss people (sorry, not sure about the name
Roman Swiss
), appart from like, five words
our languages are the same, and we get the meaning of these words (those are numbers)
Same with Belgians from the western part of the country, but without the funny words
I don’t understand people from Luxembourg, unless they start speaking French (everybody I spoke to there knew French, so I’m assuming it’s pretty common
Also, history here, we share that language with a fair number of African countries
Sure, I understand other French speakers without any issue
Canadian French is the one that is more tricky, it will not stop us from interacting with each other but a Canadian French speaker may use some words that do not even exist for me sometimes
They also have a really distinctive accent from the rest of the French speaking world
But well, it's still the same language so no real issue
For the other French speaking countries (including African countries) no issue at all, it's mostly an accent thing there
Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg might use different words sometimes (the number 90 is an entirely different word for us and the Belgians) but it's more of a "regionalism".
When it comes to other Latin languages, I learned Spanish but I'm not really good
I understand most things and it's really helped by the fact of being a French speaker
I can understand Italian, Spanish or Romanian when I read it (thus making it easier to buy groceries during holidays)
Those 3 languages are also more pronounced mostly as they are written
If someone is speaking slowly, I might get some of what they are telling me
I'm not sure if the other way around is true though, because French does not follow that rule when it comes to pronounciation
There's almost no difference between belgian, french, and swiss french
A strong canadian accent might be difficult to understand, they have some french words which we don't have or don't use the same way, and they often use a lot of english words when speaking french
Romanian is a different language, we can understand some words like with italian but that's it
Yes, people from french speaking countries understand each other just fine
We speak the same language, you just have to add accents and some funny words in the mix, but those local specific words or expressions aren't really a big deal to understand each other
Sometimes you can even figure it out yourself
Have you tried /r/french, people have patience and are always helpful there
Sounds like you have an incredible streak of bad luck when it comes to teachers
Jó napot kívánok, mate ! No one can understand Hungarian but that's what make it unique
(Great-grandmother was Hungarian, tried to learn it at university but had to drop it because of work
And two hours a week was clearly not enough for such a unique language… Still, I regret that the language has been lost in the family)
Actually, if frenchs and italians spoke a bit slower, i'm sure it would be relatively easy to understand each other
I find quite easy to understand the overall meaning of a basic sentence in Italian even though i never really studied it
Spanish is indeed a bit harder
And about the original question, no problem with Belgian and Swiss French, a very strong Québécois accent may be hard to understand but in general it's okay too
Dude you nailed it, don't be so hard on yourself
Sure people would know you aren't french, but they would totally understand what you mean
Not much unless you go look for it to be honest
France kind of has its head up its own ass when it comes to news but to a lesser extent than the US haha
News about the US involving France or broader geopolitics as well as political tensions
Definitely but that's about it
We'll occasionally hear about whatever "stupid shit Trump said this time" as well but that is mostly to be seen online
Spending a bit of time in both Sweden and the Netherlands actually made me realize why people see France as not being "English-friendly". The difference between the sheer amount of anglo-american media content/entertainment or news you come accross in those countries compared to France is baffling
No wonder we are in the bottom tier of English proficiency in Europe lol
From France : For sure daily for national and international level of US news
Is it bothering ? Yeah kind of ... we hear a lot of any small issue in the US while Lybia, Syria and many other problems on earth are not being talked about as thoroughly
Now US still being the biggest market and trend setter on many social aspects ... it is normal to hear about this country more than some others
Unpopular answer according to what I've read from the thread but here in France, the US do not feature that much in the press
Important news that have an international impact will be covered (such as the presidential election) or news that relate to global events (the Californian wildfires are linked to climate change for exemple) but apart from that, you have to actively look for news on the USA
I'd say not frequently
It depends of something happens in the US, but outside of special events like the current wildfires when there might be more, usually a bit less than one time a week
See, I think everyone misunderstood trump when he said to rake the forests
I think he said we need to *rape* the forests
At least, that would make more sense coming from him
Yeah it okay here, at least on my feed
I checked and out of the top 20, right now I have 11 news about France, 2 US, 2 Turkey, 1 UK, 1 Japan 1 Russia and 2 worldwide
I feel there is some bit of US news, but rarely the front news in France except big events
If I look at le Monde website right now, Californian fires are on 5th position, the 8th and 9th is world covid news
After, the 14th is Joe Biden, 15th Algerian demonstrations, 16th covid effect in Johannesburg
All the rest are French news
Le Figaro is even more French centered, the first international news are Lebanon already far away from the front
You guys have Arte too, and at least in France they report news everyday (and as always they are probably the best we have)
And we lived to see the stupidity of Bush Jr so completely outshone that he appears as someone not that dumb
What a world
I think I speak for all of us when I say the work y'all do as the mod team is recognized and greatly appreciated
Being able to enjoy a wide variety of questions, answers, and conversations without being inundated by agenda-pushing or bad-faith arguments is a huge part of why this sub is such a pleasure to read, and we have you to thank for it
Congratulations, /r/AskEurope
Onwards and upwards
One minute I learn new historical facts and the next everyone's favorite fizzy drinks, this sub is great
Nah
I'm French, that's all
Our culture has a bit in common with our neighbours, but I definitely can't tell I have the same identity as an Icelander or a Cypriot
When I visit any western European country, I always try to imagine if I could live there and possibly feel at home, and the answer is always yes, absolutely
I'm not commenting on Central / Eastern Europe because I've never been there, even though my family has Slovenian roots (50%)
The other half of my family is from Alsace (and a little bit of Italy too)
Alsace being a region which has changed hands from Holy Roman Empire to France, then to Germany and back to France over the centuries, and thus we have kind of a hybrid culture, with French ideals but Germanic lifestyle
I was born and raised in France but I feel strongly European
I've been to the US (many times), Mexico and Japan (only once) and loved those places, but it was probably because they felt foreign and thus interesting
De te magyar vagy
Inkább olyan vagy, mint egy másik magyar, mint egy litván, igaz
Oh hi fellow European
Great username btw
The Eiffel tower is not really overrated, but there is a place where you will definitely get a better view of paris: the tour Montparnasse
It is a very ugly black rectangle tower, and the top of it is the only place from which you won't see it
And you get to see the Eiffel tower too, so definitely a win-win
Also, the Mona Lisa is ridiculously small
If you have to pay to go up in a tower/enjoy a skyview, it's a waste of time
The Champs Elysées
I’m currently Parisian and the less I go there, the better I feel
Clearly Paris !! We often say that Paris is not France, and you will be surprise by the beauty that we have in the country side
I was disappointed by Bratislava
However the blue church was beautiful
We only had time to see Bratislava because we were staying in Vienna but Slovakia's countryside looked amazing from the book I was reading
You have a beautiful coast
My trip to Croatia was one of my best vacation
Plus it's not too crowded
When I try to describe it I tell my friends it's like Corsica, but way better
I think it's because it's easy to get to (fly to the airport, train to the city)
Also, it *is* nice
A group of us spent a long weekend there a few years ago (in January - it was freezing
We had 5 different cuisines for dinner, wandered round the canals
I spent one day at the Rijksmuseum (Rembrandt's Night Watch is one of the most amazing paintings I've seen in person; it's powerful and huge
Edit: also, the houses along the canals are beautiful
I always heard that Rhodes is nice; would you agree or not
I went years ago and can't really remember much about the inside; it's the outside that most people go for I think
The thing with London is that central London is very walkable, but if you get tired there's usually a tube station nearby
Plus, all the free museums
To visit Paris you just have to get lost on the streets and look a bit everywhere
That's the right way to do it
Way better than being in a random queue to a random museum
Or go to the museum off season
well, obviously England
we have that kind of love/hate relationship
i mean we’ve spent centuries fighting each other
that shit builds links
they are our little rosbifs <3
The UK, definitely
We have a love-hate relationship
After reading a few comments, all of them apparently
So as frenchman we have a few but I think you already know them
Germany
and
England
The other countries surrounding us are fine
Those damn English !
(But pretty much every nation in Europe consider us rivals for sole reasons)
It's mutual fear not
I would say that France and Germany have been "ennemies" from 1870 to 1950s, but France's real rival has always been the UK, aka Perfidious Albion
I'm not asking to come off as arrogant, maybe I live under a rock
But in what way do you have rivalry with us
I didn't even know
I didn’t even know we had a rivalry ! why ? i feel like i was betrayed by a friend
I notice that a lot
I see a lot of Italian anger towards the French that isn't really reciprocated
I wish we could get along
I personally have a huge amount of respect for our Italian neighbours as you're one of the few countries who take food as seriously as we do
what the hell ? i feel like everybody hates us but never told us ! first Spain, then Italy
what is it ? WE LOVE YOUR COUNTRIES
YOU’RE OUR LATIN BROTHERS, we should be a gang !
Oh, that explain why when I play with some Italians in videogames they often bring the 2006 topic for no apparent reason, I never also really understood why some of them became a little bit agressive when they realize I am french
Because of coupe du monde ?
Spain, Italy,Germany, Belgium and even Hungary (read that in a comment) are also our rivals but UK will always be the first in our heart
♫  *Three lions on the shirt ...*  ♫
No the english Love France, to the point where thet faught 2 wars that lasted a hundred years for it, but they hate the french, as every european worth of it's name do (yes even the french)
I remember our Spanish teacher told us that Spain hated us because we beheaded our king, because of Napoleon (obviously), and because of « fútbol »
sir, the land is called northern France
"france itself doesn't think it has rivalries". That's completly false man, the rivalries with England and Germany are well-known here since they were the most important
We did nothing wrong !
I mean we had napoleon so that didn't help
But we like you
Flag almost the same = good food people
Me neither mate
Me too have never heard of a Franco-spanish rivalry
Maybe it just goes one way ?
Nah, they're ours ! Hands off !
&#x200B;
It gets too dark with you guys, that's why we have to be all respectful of each other, instead of mercilessly roasting each other like we do with the Brits, which is way more fun
well it’s not really accurate anymore for Germany
we just do the funny accent and insult them behind their back when they’re being loud in public places but that’s all
> Germany historically
Germany was a rival for barely 75 years
>fear not
That's not it at all
it's the same as saying "Don't worry"/"Be assured", but old-fashioned
It’s generally because it’s linked to bad stuff we did to them in the past
It’s not so much rivalry as old grudges against us
Spain for Napoleon invading them despite them being allies at the time and taking the royal family heirs to France as hostages which is definitely a shitty thing to do to anyone
From what I understood it may have indirectly led to the Franco period
Italy probably because of Napoleon too although some of them are grateful for him ridding them of the Austrians who were oppressing them and relieving them of their riches before we did
That and I suppose a rivalry over who has the best food and maybe some football thrown in too
Honestly, as of today, the only ones we keep the rivalry hot and steamy with are the Brits
Everyone else is a lover
Except for our Rosbif neighbors !
(love you guys, though really do !)
We're better at forgiving
But the most two sided rivalry is definitely with Belgium
You're welcome for wine and apéritif any time
not mad just disappointed :( but yeah totally ! we should be the stay-more-than-six-hours-around-the-table-while-discussing-very-loud-with-our-relatives gang
The only TV shows we know from Belgium are stuff that exist in France but in a hardcore dumber way like "l'amour est dans le pré en Belgique". And it's like they take the worst people to prove that the belgian are dumber
It is unfair but i think it's a french thing and it's shame because France has discovered a few belgian celebrities that we love
French TV groups must refuse to get belgian stuff in France because I think they want to keep their programs
Canal + has put their channel in clear for free for the quarantine, and the other TV groups sued them for unloyal competition
So yeah maybe I think I know why we never see things from you but we like you
>we hate the French
That's the part we have in common
Had heard that too, that the English archers who were taken alive had two fingers cut off to make sure they could never draw a bow again because the massive use English long bows was such a problem for the French and that English archers would show their fingers to French troops to taunt them as a result
Since we all have heard the same thing I suggest we all treat that as a fact, regardless of whether it’s true or not
we just do the funny accent to be fair
Not Germany in itself but the place were Germany is, we have been rivals since Charlemagne died basically
meh not soo much in comparason to us
yeah he was kind of an asshole (he did the best and the worst, such a controversial man), sorry :)
good idea
Nah, not for us
Yup
That's straightforward
Good on him/her
>But the most two sided rivalry is definitely with Belgium
Je te demande pardon ?
During the times of Henry the Fowler and Otto the Great sure, but otherwise Germany has been virtually nonexistent until 1866
Yeah, that's one-sided too
The only rivalry we really care about is the one with England
Maybe Germany, too, but that one is not comfortable to think about
Californian What ?
I'm sorry, I understand the word but it doesnt mean anything to me next to the word "Californian". :)
We know that Macron is creating resentment abroad, we know because he creates tons of resentment in France too
Our government’s official stance is still to tell people that masks are useless unless you are actually sick, as if we didn’t have news from abroad and pictures of people in South Korea where literally everyone wears masks
The amount of stupid shit this government pulls is just tiring
The various mask piracy acts are completely stupid too no matter the country
We get our masks stolen by the US so we steal masks from others it’s literally endless
All that because they, along with the former governments, destroyed tons of those strategic reserves to cut costs over the years
yes we do ! usually there are the grandparents, uncle/aunts and the cousins
But of course you have to get along with them
and usually we spend almost all day eating
that because of « apéritif », then appetizer, the main dish, cheese, salad, dessert, and then coffee
Hey, I learned that recently but apparently to have potatoes cut in rectangular form then fried in oil is something from Paris, I'll try to find the link and put it in a edit
Edit: It took me far too long to find the link back
But here it is:
We're not very fond of ourselves either tbf
Macron wasn't that popular at the beginning of his presidency
The main reason he won is that he was against Le Pen (far right), he won even though we didn't had abstention like this since 1969
Yeah, they all did and now they are all « looks like we don’t have enough beds for everyone guys, not our fault though, it’s all because of the five guys who played a game of football last week end despite the lockdown
Ah u/L0kumi, je me rappelle bien t'avoir fourni cette information
Je suis fier de toi, propage la vérité sur cette terre :')
Is that why you left
There's usually a drain in the upper part of bathtubs and sinks so they don't overflow if the main drain at the bottom is clogged and water keep pouring
Is "wieners in the oven" a euphemism
Family of mine in Hungary felt it
~~News talks about one person dead and some damage
Info was corrected
I strongly agree with you on the party/beach thing
Well Disney as well, I just don't really like animated movies so I'm not familiar with most of the characters, I would only go to the Marvel part now that they have that
All the tropical beaches as well because I don't like when it's over 25°C.
I hate Paris as well
I have no interest in Japan, sure it might be pretty but I don't get it
If I ever went to the US, it would be Washington DC or Seattle then go to Canada, New York seems so busy and LA seems really hot and fake
Disneyland Paris
I don't see the point of coming from America and going to Disneyland when you have Paris right there
That's a very good point, how you you holiday in the US without having to drive everywhere
It sounds exhausting
It's much better to use public transportation than to have to pay for gas, tolls depending on where you are and parking
Preservative in english is conservateur in french
Préservatif in french is condom in english
A rape in english is un viol in french
Une râpe (à fromage) in french is a cheese grater in english
Komisch in German means weird while comique in French means funny
Part in Hungarian means shore while porte (trust me they almost sound the same) means door
Chat in English means what it means while chat is French is cat and chatte is pussy
And the well-known tak that means branch in Dutch, roof in Norwegian, thanks in Danish, like that in Czech, but in Latvian, yes in Polish and no in Indonesian
Besar in Spanish means "to kiss"
Baiser in French means "to fuck".
Very easy words to mix up in context, too
In French *douche* is shower, in English douche is an insult
(Mostly) in Norman French, *fagoter* is a verb meaning having clothes on, while fag°t is an insult as well in English
In French *bite* means d!ck, while in English this time it is not a cursed word
~~In some slangs *bezo* means a kid, but in Spanish it means to f#ck

Will update when i'll have less work
French "librairie" (bookshop) and English "library"
How could you forget "bite"?
Pain means bread
Another :
demand > exigence
il demande > he asks
For french and spanish :
Gato in spanish is chat in french (cat)
Gâteau in french (pronounced exactly like gato) is pastel in spanish (cake)
Pastel in french is some kind of pen, I don't know the spanish and english word for it (maybe pastel too ?)
Actually we also use "Entendre" for "Comprendre", for example the translation of "J'entends bien" is "I hear well" BUT also "I understand" :)
Baiser also mean "to kiss"
'Je lui ai baisé la main' (I kissed his hand)
Its not used very often thought
J'ai mis ceux où j'ai vraiment expérimenté un quiproquo
Mais oui t'as raison, for non french speakers : bite in english is mordre (verb) or morsure (noun) in french, bite in french is dick in english
You are correct, it is the same word in English and French:
, although most people would call them crayons in everyday speak
There's also "bitte", "please" in german
I'm talking about [those things]
According to the link, I think it's called pastel too in english
I should clarify that the second meaning is for a formal langage, It's not something you learn when you start French !
This is probably why you only know the "strict" translation
In french it's both the object and the color it produces (couleur pastel)
I love living here
But I would like to live somewhere else for some time, like in Germany or in the UK, because I love these two countries's culture
(I already went on holiday there and enjoyed it a lot)
I do love my country and living in it, but I also want to move somewhere else
Maybe not for the rest of my life, but I certainly do not want to spent all of my life in France
The first reason for me to move would be my future job
I'm in film school to become an editor, and I do not want to work in the French audiovisual industry
If I can I'd like to work in the UK and in Canada/the USA maybe
Otherwise if it's not for work there's plenty of country I'd like to discover/live in
Germany seems really nice per exemple
I like my country, but people are assholes, and our policies are so annoying, you may have to wait 4 month to have your proof of incorporation, as an example
maybe Poland or austria could be great, but i don't really know
Sure I like living in France, but I went 2 times with my best friend to Quebec and damn we absolutely loved it
I'll see after my studies what will I do
I'd also like to visit Sweden once because everything seems wonderful about it (thank you Football Manager for starting this)
Fuck yes
I enjoyed various countries as a tourist but I always feel like France is where I belong
The food culture is just so perfect in France and I would be unhappy with a limited cheese selection at the supermarket
I'm fine with living here, mostly for the work legislation, working 35h a week for the same pay as another country where they do 40h is pretty cool
Is there a lot of opportunities for work
I live in the East
It's very quiet there, and there are probably more fields than people, as they aren't a lot of big cities
Depending on where you are in France (even when just talking about the metropolitan area), it does differ a lot indeed
The South is very nice, if you wanted to move briefly I'd say go there
Crafty
You're more dangerous than I thought
We should smear some marmite on us to lure you, that should do the trick
Try Nantes or Brittany maybe, you'll get the sea without the accent
We couldn't let the golden opportunity slide
With the crisis, we do not have enough baguettes to stab all these gentlemen, as awful as it may sound
Pretty much perfect
We have access to both the Atlantic ocean and the Mediterranean sea, we have 4 different mountain range, the Alps, the Pyrénées, the Jura and the Massif Central
We have a huge diversity of environments, sceneries and culture, from the southern Europe typical ones, to the most common northern ones
We have great neighbors, allowing us to borrow (quite) a bit of their culture, mainly gastronomical
Therefore, we have heavily marked hispanic regions in the south, German influenced Alsace, and some cultural influence from both Switzerland and Italy in the Alps
Of course, we have Corsica, which is a whole culture on its own, but our relationship has always been quite complicated to say the least
I think one could spend his lifetime in France without ever getting tired of the diversity of cultures, scenery, great holidays spots, etc
I do love my land
We have the Atlantic Ocean, the Channel, the Mediterranean sea and mountains, which makes great natural defence and nice vacation spots
We also have lots of neighbouring countries, which is cool during peace time
I'd say our only weakness is the Belgian border
During most of history we had tons of land borders with rival countries and a fuckton of sea border which is a problem with the british (one of our enemies) being such a naval powerhouse for most of its history
Them being an island (so no land border with anyone) it meant they could focus on navy for their defense -something we couldn't do- and rope in various european countries to fight us on land at the same time (looking at Prussia and Austro-Hungarian Empire for example)
That was not an easy position to say the least
Now that we are all at peace I would say it's an alright position, we can easily trade with the US when they are not busy being pricks as well as with Africa, we are next to Germany which is one of our main political partners as well as next to Italy meaning the two countries with awesome food are right next to each other
Our politicians and CEOs also enjoy being right next to Switzerland and Luxembourg to go hide money from the tax administration
Belgium ensures that we are continuously supplied with excellent beer and double bath beef fat cooked fries
France
Great in time of peace, very central position, direct access to other important countries, ocean and sea connected
Terrible in time of war, very central position, other important countries have direct access, either by ocean, sea or through belgium
For real, extremely varied landscape from Normandy to la cote d azure
2 seas, 1 ocean, 4 mountains Jura Pyreenee Alps and Massif central
Good skiing spots, good surfing spots (Biarritz is top notch)
Good soil for beer, good soil for wine
No extreme event (volcano, earthquake)
The down side would be that half of France is too north for the wearher to be perfect
I d say for a small country you really have everything
Germany is a beautiful country, but the sea in the north is way too cold
This
Yeah, we good
Just wish we were a bit closer to the Nordic countries, but that's a personal, subjective opinon as I'm just totally in love with them
So basically, we bought it in 1768 IIRC, from the Kingdom of Genova
Fun fact, this was one year prior to Napoleon’s birth
Had it been a few time later, mf would have been Italian
Back then, they already had strong independent views, as shown by historical figures such as Pascal Paoli (who Napoleon tried to impress during his youth, only to understand they would never have him, a small noble from Ajaccio, at any high place)
To this day, this quest for independence is still going strong, with a heavy pressure on the island by mafiosi & nationalist terrorist groups
For example, there’s not a single McDonald in Corsica, all previous attempts to build one have been bombed at some point
Shit is so tight, my uncle’s neighbors in the south of Corsica had a red house that was visible from the coast
Since Corsicans considered it was ruining the view, they blew the living room up in the winter (so that there was no victim of course)
French language used as an official language is often seen with a bad eye there: i.g. The roadsigns are displayed both in Corsican (it ressembles an italian dialect) and in French, and the French roadsigns are often covered in bullet holes, so there’s that
Corsicans are a very proud people, maybe too much but they sure do love their island and hate anyone from the continent
They have to tolerate them of course, as tourism is probably the single biggest source of income for the island: I went to Corsica quite often in the winter about 10 years ago, in a magnificent town called Bonifacio, the place was empty in the winter, almost a ghost town
I just want to state that I ain’t no political expert nor am I an historian, so there’s a lot of details missing in here, but it’s just coming from my experience as a regular vacationer there
And now they speak French and have been quite integrated for some time
I am French, that’s part of my identity
I ve been there for tourism and it a really lovely, but it always make me remember the time when we go see  my family  in Normandy during winter,  like it a really nice but I feel like I cannot enjoy the water as I should,
But maybe I just did nt have the good weather
Those Fjørds though
People with guns in France are either criminals who buy them at the black market or hunters in which case they have a license
Hunting guns mainly, but some mafiosi do have a stock of explosives and assault rifles, although they rarely use them
Shoot-outs usually happen between mafiosis as vendetta
My father used to know a dude that got shot on his yacht in the port of Porto-Vecchio
There’s this joke about the prices
"A Parisian walks into a sandwich place in Bonifacio and asks what sandwiches are available
The owner answers:
-There’s the Corsican sandwich, corsican bread with corsican ham, corsican salad, corsican cheese and corsican butter
-Oh right, anything else
-There’s the tourist sandwich, corsican bread with corsican ham, corsican salad, corsican cheese and corsican butter
-Oh, huh
kinda similar what’s the difference
-The Corsican sandwich is 3€, the tourist sandwich is 12€
-Huh
I’ll take a corsican sandwich then
-We’re out of stock
The Plantagenet weren't Occitans
They were Angevins (from Anjou, France hence the name "Angevin Empire")
I am actually surprised by how confused so many English seem to be about their history in the middle ages haha
I suppose your reference to "Occitan" is because you heard somewhere that it is a language Richard the Lionheart probably spoke, right
Well yes, his mother was Eleanor of Aquitaine after all
Richard and his brothers spoke both old French (as their father Henry II did) and Occitan as their mother did (occitan was the language spoken in Aquitaine)
The Duchy of Aquitaine became the core of the french lands that formed the Angevin Empire as Henry came to rule it when he married Eleanor
But the duchy and the other french domains of the empire, though under the direct and independent rule of the Plantagenet kings of England, were still nominally part of the Kingdom of France as the Plantagenet ruled them as dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy, counts of Anjou etc (so vassals of the french kings basically), not as "kings of England" (a king has zero obligation to play vassalage to another one)
I don't quite understand this weird denomination in England of what is "french" and what isn't in the middle ages
The kingdom of France was a feudal state, so it wasn't centralized
All regions of the kingdom had essential things in common (dialects of the langue d'oïl in the northern half of the kingdom with old french and norman french for example being two of them and dialects of the langue d'oc in the southern half with occitan being one, then you have religion, principles of knighthood and chivalry etc) but they had social customs unique to them as well
That is to be expected in a feudal state
Poitevins weren't Flemings, Angevins weren't Normans, Aquitanians weren't Bretons, Picards weren't Parisians
So what exactly is french and what isn't in say 1066 or 1170
If people from Aquitaine, Normandy, Anjou, Provence and other regions that were ruled by feudal lords/vassals cannot be considered "French" because they weren't under the direct authority of the french king, you"re in for a shock mate haha
Until the reign of Philip Augustus (the french king who is credited with beginning the centralization of France and who infamously conquered most of the english continental holdings from King John Lackland, destroying the Angevin Empire in the process), Parisians and their immediate neighbours would be the only people that can be considered French as Paris and its surroundings were the only places the Kings of France actually ruled lmao
So yeah by that logic, only a tiny tiny minority of the people who lived in the Kingdom of France were "French". It makes zero sense
Sure, nationality was a concept which appeared centuries later but come on
They were all as French as they could have been under the shitshow that was feudalism
Nobody is going to argue that Saxons, Bavarians, Hessians etc in the HRE weren't germans
because you know "Germany", the unified state, wasn't yet a thing lol
Is your name a reference to Peter Fehervari, the warhammer 40k author
I was quite sure that it is not written that way, but I like the Scandinavian touch :P
You can argue they were an independent duchy as were most of the lands forming the kingdom of France therefore they were "Normans" as "French" as a national identity didn't exist yet
I definitely agree
That's not the matter at hand
French culture, language and ethnicity did exist or at least for the two former the many variants of it
The matter at hand is how the hell can anyone consider the Normans (those of the Duchy of Normandy, right
) in 1066 to not be French which in itself isn't the issue
but go around describing them as Scandinavians, when they were ethnically and culturally more of the former
The Normans (Viking raiders) who settled Normandy (named after them) in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte were purely and simply Scandinavians yes, there was nothing french about them, absolutely nothing
But you're aware there were people already living in those lands they settled in northern France, right
That population didn't magically disappear when Rollo and his men settled it
There is a reason the Norsemen were the ones assimilated and not the opposite
Scandinavians have never been a majority in Normandy, even if it was named after the norse settlers
The House of Normandy itself, while of nordic heritage (Rollo being the first ruler and patriarch of the house), cannot be considered a scandinavian family in 1066 either
Rollo's son William Longsword (second ruler of Normandy) was half french ethnically as his mother was Poppa of Bayeux (matriarch of the house)
William Longsword himself then married Luitgarde of Vermandois who gave birth to the third ruler Richard I of Normandy
By that point, how can they even be described as "french-speaking Norsemen" or "Norsemen who adopted french culture"? By 1066, even the ruling dynasty itself was predominantly french by blood
Keep in mind William was the 7th ruler of Normandy
7 generations
Do you know that joke about some dude from Boston, Massachussets claiming to be Irish because he descends from some Irish dude who settled the US generations ago and married a local woman
His ancestors haven't exactly been Irish after that but hey he is lmao
Here I quote an excerpt of Cambridge Medieval History, edited by J.R. Tanner, C.W. Previte-Orton, Z.N. Brook
(Volume 5, Chapter XV
It reads:
> “To understand the Normandy of 1066 it is not necessary to go back to the foundation of the duchy in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, or to attempt to dispel the fog that surrounds the careers of the first three dukes
These princes, Rollo (911-931), his son William Longsword (931-942), and his grandson Richard I surnamed The Fearless (942-996), were all undoubtedly men of mark; but nevertheless for this period there are really very few reliable details available
Dudo, dean of Saint Quentin, who wrote about 1020, indeed professes to tell their story, but his work is fundamentally untrustworthy and for the most part based on legend and hearsay
Some important points, however, can be established about the development of the duchy during the tenth century
The first is that by the end of the reign of Richard I (996) the descendants of the original Norse settlers had become not only Christians but in all essentials Frenchmen
They had adopted the French language, French legal ideas, and French social customs, and had practically merged with the Frankish or Gallic population among whom they lived
I am interested in your sources though to have a broader perspective
That is weird to say though
That french nobles who very obviously came from France, weren't Anglo-Saxons and didn't even speak english as a mother tongue or most not even at all until Edward IV (was it
) were more culturally english than french
In England, in the middle ages, there was a very clear cultural schism between the lower class and the royalty/nobility
The english nobles held holdings both in France and England and spent time in both
In fact until the Plantagenet were cut off from the continent in 1214 with the destruction of the Angevin Empire, many of them spent much of their time in their french holdings, with some (Richard comes to mind) most of it
I don't think there were that much cultural differences between french nobles and english ones at all
Both the french and english nobility were that interlinked
It can be argued that it is the merging of the norman and french culture the medieval english nobility with that of the anglo-saxon lower class that evolved into english culture and the english language as we know it
And sorry but no
haha like I said, all regions of France were independent in the middle ages, so yes they all had a culture and social customs unique to them
That is totally understandable in a non-centralized feudal state
But it is absolutely ridiculous to claim the Normans (nobility and peasantry alike) were ethnically or culturally closer to Danes or Norwegians than they were to let's say Parisians
By 1066, that was no longer the case at all and that is supported by english historians themselves
The region called Normandy (after the Norsemen settled it in 911 by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte) was already populated by a gallo-roman/west frankish population
The local population was not relocated after the norse settlement
The Scandinavians were a minority among the larger french population as Rollo and his men settled it after a failed viking raid (the Siege of Chartres in 911), it was not a some mass immigration from Scandinavia
The House of Normandy, while of nordic heritage (Rollo being the first ruler and patriarch of the house of course), cannot be considered a scandinavian family in 1066 either
Rollo's son William Longsword (second ruler of Normandy) was half french ethnically as his mother was Poppa of Bayeux (matriarch of the house)
William Longsword himself then married Luitgarde of Vermandois who gave birth to the third ruler Richard I of Normandy
By that point, how can they even be described as "french-speaking Norsemen" or "Norsemen who adopted french culture"? William the Bastard was the 7th ruler of Normandy
By 1066, even the ruling dynasty itself was predominantly french not just culturally, but by blood as well
This is written even in english history books
Here I quote an excerpt of Cambridge Medieval History, edited by J.R. Tanner, C.W. Previte-Orton, Z.N. Brook
(Volume 5, Chapter XV
It reads:
> “To understand the Normandy of 1066 it is not necessary to go back to the foundation of the duchy in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, or to attempt to dispel the fog that surrounds the careers of the first three dukes

They had adopted the French language, French legal ideas, and French social customs, and had practically merged with the Frankish or Gallic population among whom they lived
So the whole Normans in 1066 being considered more Scandinavians than French thing is a bit ridiculous
Yeah I suppose he must have Hungarian roots
I know he lives in London but no idea if he is originally from there
Well
the Norsemen who settled Normandy in 911 not being ethnically the same as the "Normans" living in Normandy in 1066 is the point I've been trying to make since the beginning
I for one have a hard time understanding how the Duchy of Normandy was populated by people who were ethnically Scandinavians in 1066 when Scandinavians never were a majority in Normandy when they settled it in 911 to begin with
Many (the ruling family and nobility especially) had Scandinavian ancestors
William the Bastard is a descendent of Rollo
I understand Rollo being considered ethnically Scandinavian
I mean he 100% was
But I have a hard time understanding how William can be considered that if his ancestors after Rollo haven't exactly been Scandivians
A bit of Scanxinavian in him sure but that's about it
Does the concept of ethnicty works differently in Japan
lol
I don't know man
if my dad is ethnically French and my mom ethnically Japanese
I am ethnically half-French and half-Japanese
And if I marry and have a family with a Japanese woman myself, then my children are 3/4 Japanese and only 1/4 French, so mostly Japanese ethnically speaking, no
That's how it works where I am from
Nationality is something recent yes and cannot be applied to the past but ethnicity is not
Blood has always been blood
The Normans weren't "French"... not French like I am
That didn't exist in 1066
Nobody is questioning that
I left France 2 years ago for my studies because I wanted to live somewhere else as I was tired of France (education, administration, work
) and wanted to take a degree in English
Now I've got a nice boyfriend here in Denmark (+ being gay here is way easier here than in France) and I started a job in field around a month ago
Plus each time I went back to France to visit my friends and family, I was super happy to leave again after 2 weeks, and I'm just negatively fascinated every single time I hear something about French politics
So not planning at all to move back
I left France in 2005 for a world tour
Instead of spending a few days or weeks in a country, I stay for a few years
Middle-East, Asia, Africa, North America
I’m sitting out the sanitary crisis in rural US at the moment and hope to move out in a couple of years when it’s over
South America looks interesting to me
I might just go if Americans decide to elect Trump again in November
I became a third culture kid because of my dad's job
He works for a  multinational, so I was raised in the US, the UK and Belgium, and educated in international schools
I've now settled in Brussels and work full-time in English despite being French
Well, I don't know which one is the best for the programme you're looking for, but I studied in Aarhus and it was quite nice (in humanities)
Concerning living expenses, I wouldn't recommend Copenhagen as rents are insanely high (like 600€/month for a room), so other main university cities (Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense) are better on this point, but concerning night/student life, Copenhagen and Aarhus are the best
In general, living in Denmark is more expensive than almost every European country, especially for you coming from Lithuania, but if you find a student job (easier to find in Aarhus and Copenhagen if you don't speak Danish) and work 10-12 hours a week, you can get a scholarship of around 600€/month in addition to your salary, so it's quite easy to get around 1100€/month, which is way enough to live comfortably

Too much poetry in one day, have a good evening
Yes Arnold Dan's Les starting blocks
Arnold (from the 80s show) in the starting blocks
I knew it as “mandarle un fax al diablo”
It's actually refering to coil pottery
A "colombin" is a long sausage of clay, and clay is usually brown in colour
As an image is worth a thousand words ...
Yes sure
But I don't see really the analogy of this
"Avoir la taupe au guichet" (to have the mole at the check-in counter)
"Avoir le cigare au bout des lèvres" (to have the cigar at the edge of the lips)
"Passer par le Chappa'ai" (going through the Chappa'ai - Stargate reference)
There's probably more out there
>"Mouler un cake", Mold a cake
Weird, I always heard "démouler un cake", un-mold (?) a cake
"sa race" or "sa mère" can be added to any sentence
And that's the beauty of these two expression
It was popular in the 80s, not so much now, Lada France actually died a few years ago
I only know of it because a friend of mine is obssesed with his goddamn Lada
Lada is also the name of the greenhouse unit on the International Space Station used to grow plants [
That was my first car
When I worked at a touristic site in Paris and Americans always tried to pay me so they could cut the queue and I was like "that's corruption of a state employee sir, also I earn enough doing my job thank you"
Oh man we really like to criticize food and that's the same if we're invited but it's not meant at an insult, just our sincere opinion
Edit: of course there are limits and the guy is wrong to have said that, just saying in general
An outdoor BBQ is done the same way as a picnic so yeah, you have to bring your own food
If the host invit you in his house, he provide the food, just like for an usual dinner
You just have to bring a bottle of wine/beers or some snacks to be polite
I think in this case it feels weird to be in socks with complete strangers, removing shoes is for friends, when you’re comfortable
So maybe you keep your shoes on a bit for introductions and then remove them if it’s more the style of the house
Or you know, context, if everyone has shoes on, you keep them, or the other way
You don't say that to your hosts though
Especially your MIL
> I've had many instances where I show up and am fed some charcuterie, wine, bread, nuts and the night kind of ends
Because you weren't invited to diner but to *apéritif*.
The BBQ is known to be something informal where everybody pinches in
But if someone invites you to *dinner*, you'll look odd bringing food
People are expected to bring wine at most
I mean if I invite someone to come over for dinner, dinner is expected
If I offer a friend to come over for a beer at 19:00, I obviously have eaten either so we'll figure out what to do later
I don't know, it just makes sense
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Probably easier to sleep early when it's always dark outside and the sun is gone after 6pm
Suck it
Beautifully described
Spain is also on the wrong time zone
The sun rises about 1
3 hours later than if your timezone was correct
When I went to England, by the time we went to the night club (01:00) every English people was trashed and going home
It was weird
( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)
Maybe a little like that
If it’s too meet casually without really any solid activities, it’s alright, but for specific activities, or if someone has something to do later, you just lose time with the people you meet
Or the whole country works the same way
The Tales of Charles Perrault were pretty dark
Disney softened much of the original tales
Mmh
Peau d'Anne ( ***Donkeyskin***  ) from Perrault is pretty weird : A king had a beautiful wife and a rich castle, including a marvelous  donkey whose droppings were gold
One day his wife died, after making  him promise not to marry except to a woman whose beauty and attributes  equaled hers
It became clear that the only woman who would fit the  promise was his own daughter
So yeah, incest
&#x200B;
Except that, well,
* The beauty and the beast which is basically a stockolm syndrom novel
* Barbe Bleue novel (Blue beard) from Perault is quite brutal, considering the main character killed all his wifes
* Le petit poucet ( **Hop-o'-My-Thumb** ) from Perault, where the children are abandoned by their parents and Poucet have to save his brothers and sisters from an Ogre
* I also read the original version of "the 3 littles pigs"  when I was a child . The wolf resolves to come down the chimney, whereupon the pig who owns the brick house lights a pot of water on the fireplace
The wolf falls in and is boiled to death
Then, the pigs eat him
In France, our child stories were not that disturbing, but our nursery rythmes on another hand
I mean, we truly learned them at school, and yet, most of us don't know the meaning of the lyrics
* [Il était un petit navire] (there was a little ship) is about canibalism ([translation]
&#x200B;
* [Ne pleure pas jeannette] (Don't cry Jeannette)
In a nutshell, [The lyrics] are:
* *Don't cry Jeanette, We will marry you off
To the son of a prince, Or the son of a baron
* *I don't want any prince,  Even less a baron
I want my beloved Peter,  The one who's in prison*
* *You won't have your Peter,  We'll hang him*
* *If you hang Peter,  Hang me with him,*
* *And they hanged Peter,  And his Janet with him .*
&#x200B;
* [Une sourie verte] (a green mouse) is a song about the torture of the vendéens (who wore green uniforms back this time) during the french revolution:
* *"  A green mouse, That ran in the grass, I caught it by its tail, I showed it to those men
The men said: Dip it in oil, Dip it in water
It will become a snail
Nice and warm
&#x200B;
* [A la pêche aux moules] (Fishing for mussels)  is about the [rape of a child
] Yep
&#x200B;
* [Alouette, gentille alouette] is about killing/cooking alive an skylark (bird)
&#x200B;
* [Il court, il court le furet] is a spoonerism
If you switch the letters C and F, "*Il court, il court le furet"* (he run, he run, the ferret) become "*Il fourt, il fourt, le curé*" (He shag, he shag, the priest)
* You will understand the rest with the video haha *"He run, he run, the ferret, the ferret from the wood, myladies
*" ;)
&#x200B;
* [Au claire de la lune] is about prostitution
&#x200B;
* [Jean petit qui danse] (Jean petit is dancing) is about a french dissident, Jean Petit, who died in  1643  from the  [Breaking wheel] torture
The way this torture method works is by breaking the bones of the convicted person, one by one, so here they start by breaking his fingers, than his hand, his foot, his leg etc
So the lyrics "*Jean petit is dancing with his leg, with his hand, with his foot etc*" sounds more
disturbing
&#x200B;
* [Sur le pont du nord] (the North Bridge) where a young girl wants to go to a ball on the North Bridge, but her mother refuses
She will go there in secret with her brother
The bridge collapsed and they both died
Bad luck
&#x200B;
* [La Rirette] is about the gangbang/rape (?) of a young woman and 4 "young and handsome men".
&#x200B;
* [Le petit cordonier] (the little shoemaker) is about an alcoholic shoemaker who beats his wife " [He'd beat her so right
Exactly as needed
&#x200B;
* [Il était une bergère] It is the story of a shepherdess who made a cheese
Her cat ate the cheese, so she killed it
Later, feeling remorse, she went to confess to the village priest
The priest says "*My Child, for penance, we will "kiss" each other"*. Later, she said she liked it so much, she will kill another cat
&#x200B;
* [A la claire fontaine] is basically a woman who lost her boyfriend because she refused to have sex with him
Merkel because on our century,hitting a woman is socially innaceptable
So win by forfeit
With my (now ex) American boyfriend, we had a heated argument about what was a "filet mignon". For a French, it's pork, for an American, it's some sort of beef steak ? Anyway I won by asking in which language that name was
Well, yes, "misérable" can mean despicable or pathetic
I had the reverse experience living in Australia
I remember talking to a guy in a resort town who had made a « short 6 hours drive » to spend the weekend there
I definitely understand what you mean
Italian dad, Canadian mum, born in Cambridge, lives in France most of my life
I feel french but I have italian documentation
I’ve been losing my Italian accent and it breaks my heart
I getchu bro
Could you recommand some good Greek youtube channels with English subtitles please ? I'm learning Greek and I want to listen more to the language :)
Hungarian culture is so cool
I will do it !
Architecture, language, cuisine
I'm too lazy to develop but yeah that's it
[LAUGHS IN FRENCH MEAL]
It's really unbelievable how many wine bottles we can drink at a meal
For instance when my parents invite friends or family members, for a lunch, if we are around 6 people in total, we can drink up to 4-5 or 6 bottles sometimes
EDIT : Damn, talking about my country's alcohol problem gave me my first Award, thank you
In France you can absolutely trash yourself but still be seen as a fine alcool connoisseur
South west of France and a part of Spain has [Feria]
Once upon a time it was nice festival with some fanfare, bullfighting, religious celebration ...
Now it's a great occasion to get wasted with thousands of other peoples drinking cheap bear/vine/sangria/whatever
Bayone in the extreme case, the whole town become a giant bar
The fuck are they thinking about ? Drinking but not getting drunk ? Are they drinking water or what ? Of course drinking is for getting drunk, otherwise we wouldn't say "drunk".
Of course, not absolutely shitfaced every time, and not getting drunk is fine too, but the people who want to drink but consider being drunk as immature and irresponsible don't seem to understand how it works
Bad but young people like it because its so cooool to be drunk
And in UK whether Scotland or England you have the Fireball that have been a real pain in the ass for the country
And going to the bar is also normalized
And as a beer geek, when I go to taste a new release with friends, I know it IS a "traquenard" (we can translate by trap) and I'll wake up at 9AM with a can in my hand at a friend's apartment
Other detail : next Monday I'll work and study in Paris
Goodbye, liver
So yeah being drunk is the standard weekend in France
Snaps
You mean Schnaps
It's what we call eau-de-vie in French (even if Schnaps is also used in Alsace and Lorraine for the kirsch, the quetsche and the mirabelle) or brandy in English
You've never really been in France or Germany if you've never saw us wasted man
Just the sheer amount of alcohol we can consume during a single family diner (*extremely* important in our culture
Starts at 11-12h and finish at 16h with the full menu of entrée-plat-fromage-dessert-café, and of course, a lot of wine and other booze)
Getting hammered once a week is the staple for students here
Student's party generally take place every Thursday
Fun fact, we're also one of the 3 country in Europe with the biggest alcoholism problem
So all in all, I wouldn't say we're just a "social only drinking" country
Yeah that's what I also think (even though, wine is around 12%, it goes fast)
But not foreign friends who told me that they never knew a country that is used to drink more on a regular basis than France
Edit : the record at a meal for 7 people was 3 bottles of champagne, 2 of red Bordeaux, 2 of red Bourgogne and 3 bottles Muscadet if I remember well
But it was not at my parents' place, we were invited by friends of them
"drinking wine is more upper class and thus you cannot be alcoholic
Dude you really don't know the Villageoise, a.k.a. the wine of the homeless drunkards
Maybe private parties aren't the same as back home
What is an AF event
Also, you just could've find french people that do not like to drink, they exists as in any other country x)
The polite thing might be it, they're new in a different country than theirs, they must not want to look like total trash in front of you, or they don't know how you drink in NZ
Yup, I'm not really aware of the prices and the alcohol market in Finland
France is really one of the only countries with wine bottles sold for 2 or 3 euros
Well, the AF things aren't moments to drink to death, everyone's here to share something, to discover, to talk
Not really to get shit faced
Especially during a tasting, never get drunk during a testing
You wouldn't taste anything at all in the end
You drink cheap beers*
I'm the kind of asshole that pays a 44cL can of beer 9€ because it's a Double New England IPA
But for things like whisky, you can have some good shit for a really cheap price
(My go-to for a party is the Glen Turner Heritage Double Cask, it's around 18-20€ for a bottle and it's actually nice)
I officially invite you to one of my family diner next time you come to France
I also invite you to a student party
It'd be a shame not to try them
Bidets
They've been very rare for decades now
Even 30 years ago, they were already uncommon
A few bigots pretended that bidets were meant for prostitutes' hygiene, and then bidets vanished
Les Bouilleurs de Cru Ambulant !
They used to go to every village to make Gnole, a strong fruit Liquor with the fruits that the villagers recolted during the year, it used to be somewhat of a event where everybody were together, laughing, eating and drinking all day with the Bouilleur de Cru before going home with their barrel or bottles of Liquor for the year
Here I think it's snowy winters too
It has been years since we last got a real snowy winter
Although this year we got 3-4 days of kinda big snow, but still, the vast majority of the season, we don't have any snow
Makes me kinda sad, I love snow
I just came back from Namibia and the amount of bugs I had on my windshield reminded me of my childhood years in France
Now there's barely any insect left to kill just by driving
True artisanal boulangeries
Baker is a tough job, fewer youg bakers want to wake up at 4am to bake, so they become "bread depots" if I can say that
Resistance against the stupid decisions of the government
Ha llegado el afilador
Pretty funny, i learnt of the existence of such job (and, therefore, people) in Spanish classes, i guess it really was a thing
Oh man same here, yet last week, on my way back to work, on foot, I went through a little dirt road (I live in a small town), and there it was : a small hedgehog, probably young, drinking from a puddle
Didn't seem scared by me, but I pushed it out of the way cause cars go through that dirt road
They're a protected species nowadays in France
The Japanese are slowly but surely getting more French than us
That makes for a fantastic contrepèterie
It's forbidden now, cause the licenses to be a bouilleur de cru aren't renewed
It's a matter of taxes
Funny you should say that
I go to Portugal quite often and I’m always amazed at how much going to church is still going strong in your country
In France, church attendance is so low many of them don’t even open their doors on Sundays
Yeah it's the same in my town, only two bakeries left, there used to be a 3rd one where I would always go with my grandmother, the owner was a elderly lady who was dedicated *corps et âme* to her bakery, she really insisted that she wouldn't quit unless she died
Then eventually she closed her business, nowadays it's been bought up by three young chaps working as *traiteurs* (not sure of the English term)
I remember back when it was still a bakery/boulangerie, my mom worked briefly there with the owner
Now the only two left in my town are one in an Intermarché (the baguettes they sell taste off, their pâtisseries also taste bad) the 2nd one is outrageously pricy as Hell (seriously 3€ for a baguette ?! Vous êtes fou à lier, ma parole !) and their stock always get dilapidated by the clients
There was one doing it in my street too when I was little, but he retired & nobody took his place
They pretty much disappeared, now, I think
We had lots of ambulant professions, like the “tripoteuses”: women who would go from village to village & prepare the inhabitants’ meat (in such a way that it would last more than a few days: they’d smoke it, make sausages, make ham
Also, the milkman is no longer a thing
We are slowly adopting japanese toilets
I've still seen it in public toilets in my city not so long ago
Also they're not free
Even worse, they have a timer
Beware the timer if you're constipated
There is still a few of them, but i don't think they are more than a hundred in France now
My grandfather had two Lada Nivas, 1st one suffered a gearbox failure (lack of servicing killed it for the most part) 2nd one was rotten to the chassis (the seller had painted over the rust, it started showing up again, the paint's bubbling where the rust spots are) + engine died after my grandfather put diesel instead of petrol
Seeing them rotting away in his yard really pains me
Japan is in the future when it comes to toilets
They got bidets but with tons of electronics and stuff
In public WC
Slowly
Give them time
Mildly interesting : in France the correct word would be urinoir, pissoir seems to be Swiss French
Well, the more you know
No, I found it really strange when I saw one for the first time in th USA, I seams like something from an ancient time, something only sects would do
I also found strange that they were so many different style of church (not the building but the community and style)
Last time I checked, except jehovah witnesses, you never see any public reference to religion in IRL France (well, except for the lieux de cultes and religious associations, obviously, but most of them are sneaky)
I remember seeing a couple of billboards about Jesus in Slovakia, but nothing as bad as these examples
I don’t think it’s legal in France
There are, however, sometimes ads for religious charities
And when you enter Marseille by road, there is a big “CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS” painted on a house wall over the highway
Generally speaking, I don’t think Europe is really fond of big, colorless signs that are basically just a phrase screamed at you
I've never seen that around
That would be hella creepy
I've seen one "Jesus is your saviour" painting on a wall in Spain once, graffiti style, it actually looked cool
Other than that, no
In France it would be really awkward
France; nope
I live a 3m away from a church and never seen anyone in it
I don't think those religious billboard would be very long lived even if public proselytizism (orthograph ?) were allowed (no idea if it is probably not considering the rest of the forbidden religious stuff)
I can easily imagine them being defaced very very fast
Public demonstration of faith and references to faith like these are frowned upon in France
Maybe big religious places like Lourdes or popular pilgrimage way to Compostelle in Spain could have them maybe ?
I’ve seen one in my life
It was written on the side of a big truck trailer and parked up next to the side of a motorway for people to see
Just a simple “Jesus is Good” message that I assume the guy painted himself because it was bloody awful
There’s a guy who writes "Jesus loves you" (graffiti) everywhere in town here, probably a jehova guy or something
Was super strange to see one for the first time, like, dude, wth
>Last time I checked, except jehovah witnesses, you never see any public reference to religion in IRL France (well, except for the lieux de cultes and religious associations, obviously, but most of them are sneaky)
I thin it's forbidden due to laïcité?
I walk by them everyday, I didn't know what it mean as I don't speak polish
thanks for the translation haha
I guess it's more against same-sex marriage
Yes, you're right
You are not allowed to build any religious thing on a public building or area and such kind of poster are 100% illegal
But the french laïcité is such a rabbit hole, You could spend 3 days and 3 nights reading laws on it, and still not understanding exactly how it is applied
Surprisingly, mass is on public TV every Sunday morning in France
But other religions also have screen time on Sunday morning on the same channel
Laïcité à la Française
I recognized 'cult'.
I'd say Italian and Spanish actually
I've learnt Italian at school, and let me tel you that I am *bad* at it
But even if I can't speak it, I can still read it and get the gist of the text
Spanish is also quite easy to understand even though I never learnt it
I don't know what Romanian looks like but I'd really love to
Portuguese seems like a weird language to me, especially the prononciation
I can't understand it even when I try hard
Clearly Italian, most of the time we can get like 70~75% of what can be write on an information sign
I can understand Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (only written though), English (a lot of French loanwords make it easy to understand with no knowledge), Romanian (only written, and even sometimes I struggle reading it) and Hungarian (I must be the only one in the whole country tho)
As a French, none
Even though Spanish courses have been easier than English, I have a better understanding of English texts but that's really just experience
I'm sure Spanish would be like a second language on equal experience
Totally agree, Italian and Spanish are way more easy to read than Portuguese and Romanian
I think they are also easier than French-based creole (from Martinique for example)
I think the easiest language to understand for a french people is Catalan
Ex: **constitucion de Catalunya**
**Article 1
*De la sobirania de Catalunya*
Catalunya es constitueix en Estat democràtic de dret
**Article 2
*De l’Estat català*
La forma política d’organització de l’Estat és la república parlamentària
Els principis que regeixen l’ordenament jurídic de l’Estat són la llibertat, la justícia, la igualtat de drets i obligacions, l’avançament dels Drets Humans i la celebració de la diversitat
**Article 3
*Dels símbols nacionals*
La bandera de Catalunya és la tradicional de quatre barres vermelles sobre fons groc
L’himne oficial de Catalunya és ‘Els Segadors’.
La Diada nacional es celebrarà el dia 11 de setembre
Els símbols nacionals mereixen respecte, doncs representen una nació i els sentiments de pertinença dels seus habitants, però no poden ser mai imposats a ningú que no vulgui reconèixer-los com a propis
**Article 4
*De la llengua*
La llengua pròpia de Catalunya és el català. El català és, doncs, la llengua oficial de Catalunya, i l’emprada per l’administració de l’Estat
L’espanyol és llengua co-oficial de Catalunya, en virtut del dinamisme de què gaudeix al nostre país. El seu coneixement serà promogut entre la població. Els ciutadans de Catalunya que prefereixin expressar-se en aquesta llengua amb l’administració de l’Estat tenen dret a ser atesos sense discriminació de cap tipus
La parla aranesa serà objecte d’ensenyament i d’especial respecte i protecció.
Catalan is indeed *very* easy to understand, but I couldn't've known, it's the first time I read it
I would have said Italian aha !
I've gone in spain this summer and I understood nothing (that was not catalan but arround Basque Country)
Alcohol, complaining, the family dinner that ends up in a shouting match
Our inconditionnal love for good wine, charcuterie, bread and cheese
It’s very common in rural France, every family has their homemade « eau de vie » that they will offer after the meal
Same answer but with baguettes
Ah my sweet country :')
I'd say the saucisson and foie gras au petit dej' too
And the chocolatine vs chocolatine debate
Mind you, alcohol consumption has drastically diminished in the past decades in our country, especially regarding wine
First time I went to Spain we went to a bar early evening for after-hike drinks
We bought 3 rounds of drinks and with each round came tapas
Don't remember the first two plates, but the third was a huge plate of fries with pork in a creamy tomato sauce
Then we had to go back to the hotel for dinner
Yknow, as a Frenchman, I don't dislike the poldermodel
It's part of what makes living in NL such a pleasant experience, and there's a level-headedness in public discourse that's rarer elsewhere
Not by French standards I assure you
Foie gras au petit déjeuner
Once met a young guy on a ferry going to Dover
He was German but a Man Utd supporter and once a month he'd come over to watch a match
They do eau de vie with what they have, potatoes, pear, apples, whatever
I am sure you can do with grapes too
if you have some on your land
Et au gouter avec une tranche de nutella ;)
Je mange des tartines de coulomniers et du chocolat chaud perso, n'allons pas jeter la première pierre
I eat some every christmas
Disagreeing is not a bad thing my dude
Yknow, I thought so too (A'dam resident) and I attempted to escape to Randorp in a small cottage for a peaceful NYE
I did take a stroll through the village around midnight and every fucking house had their own nation-grade stash going off, not to mention the guys on one of the village squares having fun next to the historical churches
Madness
Everywhere
Sandwich made with a baguette, ham, cheese, butter (and potentially more things)
Our fast food is a bottle of wine, a saucisson, and a baguette with butter and cheese (or ham)
O'Tacos
You will never feel hunger again
The "traditional" one is just ham & butter, also known as a [jambon-beurre]
Also [galette saucisse] if you live in Brittany
In South Alsace we have the « mauricette » it is  sandwich made of bretzel batter
I think it only exists here
Oh, i thought it was the mitraillette
or some pâté de campagne or rillettes to spread on the baguette
Or, as I've noticed, more a beurre-jambon
Half a block of butter and some manky ham :(
Please, France, get more imaginative with your sandwiches (and the plural is not spelled 'sandwichs')
I think that's just Rennes/Ille-et-Vilaine
A croque monsieur is different because it is cooked
Smoked ham, cornichons and mayonnaise is where it's at
In Côtes d'Armor, you can find them as well
I like saucisson and cornichons
Displaying one is weird except during sporting events like the World Cup or the World Cup
So weird, no one is proud to be french
In France we unfortunately left the flag to nationalists ... Result is that it's very odd to have or display the national flag home or in public
In France, it’s considered to be offensive for other nationalities and therefore racist
i think a lot of people have a flag at home, for football matches for example, but displaying it in front of your house is weird and we could think that your from extreme right (which is not a really good thing)
Outside of sporting events, I would assume you are a far right supporter
You forgot May 2 - which is literally "Polish National Flag Day"
Except for the flag of some regions
Yes I do own a Breton flag and wave it everywhere I can
I would even automatically assume that people with French flag on their house when it's not the World Cup are racist far right people
I disagree
There is an ammount of people that have a flag on their window
Ah yes my flag of Ile De France
Well no
I prefer to remember 2018, especially for you :p.
It used to be very true, however I feel like in the recent years many people have started putting a flag, even if small ones, on their balcony for various reasons (terrorist attacks, World Cups) and just never removed them
which in most cases are some close minded racists
Yeah feeling the same
Terrorist attacks do tend to give more voters to the far right
I lived in Gloucestershire and I saw more Welsh flags around than English ones
Having a flag don't make you a fascist
It is stupid to think like that
Thinking like that is giving these people the exclusivity of the flag
I haven’t said EVERYBODY who flys a french flag is racist ....
Unfortunately no
My mum lives in the middle of the countryside, the few houses that fly are voting extreme right, then most of her area actually votes extreme right ...
I was at a busy campground in upstate NY years ago, and a lot of the folks had flagpoles with flags on them
I was in the Portsmouth area this summer
I didn't see a lot
But I suppose that with Brexit, more people put their flags out
[It's so stereotypical of your country that you guys even do it in France]
[this one ] would say
I can think of many pictures that most French people would immediately recognise and associate with historic events
Those ones are particularly famous
1° [Mitterand and Kohl holding hands] has become a symbol of the Franco-German reconciliation
The picture was taken at the Verdun memorial
2° [Charles de Gaulle's appeal of 18 June]
This picture was actually taken later but it is still widely used to illustrate Charles de Gaulle's radio speeches to the French people after he was forced to go to London
They were broadcast via the BBC
3° [President Chirac turnstile jumping]
That one is super famous in France too
(Though obviously not from one of our photographers or anything)
I'd say  [this one] is more well known
I thought of the same event but from another angle
Also, [that one] is pretty well known
Bonus: [not a picture, but everyone has seen that one]
It's amazing
It's an amazing photo, but fuckin' hell it's a horrible context
This guy is heartbreaking
À peu près pareil je pense
Mais la tienne est plus épique
I think the most well known french painting is [this one] or maybe [this one]
I prefer la Liberté to be honest
Probably the second one, you’re right
It's the second one
I prefer it too
It's a mild inconvenience, but could our Members of parliament stop talking about islamic veil for like five minutes and talk about real issues like climate change
Hate for the capital city
It so weird
Sure some (very rare) parisians look down on the rest of the country but everyone I've asked had no problems when moving to Paris
But if you try to move to another city from the capital and people will tend to be more hostile to you
When I went to study in another city, 90% of my new friends were actually morrocan from casablanca cause they didn't assume I'd be a dick without ever speaking to me
There are news stories of former parisians moving to other cities only to be told wrong directions when asking a local were to find something
In Marseille your car might even get damaged if it's immatriculated with a parisian license plate
So unwarranted
Smoking
I never smoked a single cigarette in my life
But people here smoke _so much_. I already saw parents smoking next to their baby or child, or even non-smokers
Plus the littering of the cigarettes
Like ugh, they're literally nothing good about smoking
France is one of the countries that smoke the most
Fortunatly it's decreasing, but slowly, and now people vape instead
It's not really better
Same in France, I’m a teacher too, let me tell you it’s downright shameful
rants are good
At least you're making yourself heard
same in france
It's gottent better but you'll still see garbage in the streets
It's annoying
Also people don't pick up after their dogs
I wish there was a bigger proximity police presence
thankfully there's municipal police in paris now and they seem to be doing a good job
what about work, bars or activities/club
also some dating apps have a "friend" option which you could try
What do you mean
Don't you find it unacceptable that you can buy hallal food in the supermarket
It's a disgrace
France is attacked at its core
We cannot allow that
Islamism is running rampant
Truly France has never been lower
And I'm not being racist, I have a friend who's [more black than arab]
hell nah fuck Paris dude, ive been there 3 times, ive had  awful experiences with parisians all of those times
Also i hate everything this city stands for and how the people in charge do to keep everything there
so you're agaisnt the lockdown
Europe isn't one unified country
Making such a broad generalisation about something is bound to be false
I obviously can't talk about the whole of europe but if you're part of the LGBTQ+ community, be more carefull in eastern conservative countries like poland
&#x200B;
In france you should be safe, I don't know about the countryside (though it doubt it's much worse) but in the cities there are very few cases of aggressions (1870  cases of homophobic or transphobic infractions in 2019 for the whole country)
None of my LGBTQ+ freinds have ever told me of harassement
It's definitley an issue but you won't be in any kind of danger
Being trans is probably what would put someone the most at risk, but once again it's extremely rare
kinda, it seems like the only viable solution to slow the epidemic until we get vaccines
> thinking it's a lasting step towards a totalitarian system with impacted basic human rights and corrupt media
Seems kind of absurd
Do you have so little faith in your government that you seriously believe they want to keep you at home
Also lockdowns are terrible for the economy and their reeelection so I'm sure they'd avoid it if they could
Additionally you'll notice that the politicians around the world who did not go into lockdown are the most self absorbed and/or crazy of the bunch (Trump, Bolsonaro, etc
As for corrupt media, sure some media might be bias but there are independant agencies that can tell you which sources have the least amount of bias and you can always sample from a wide range
> Some fear the vaccines might be tested to little, up to thinking they might sterilize them, mark them, or even impact them biologically
Not much to do with lockdown but common, there's a european agency tasked with testing that stuff and it's known for being particularly rigorous
> Some people think the virus might not be worse than a flu
just look at the numbers way more people died of covid in Germany in 2020 than of the flu in 2018
And in 2020 we had face masks, constant hand washing, and a few lockdowns
Imagine what the numbers would have been if no precautions had been taken
> there is no special virus at all
Don't you know at least one person who got covid
I know a few and one still can't taste anything months after
> scientific world rendered unreliable by capitalism
The scale of the conspiracy would be so massive
Why would every country on earth, some that have been at war or on the brink of it, suddenly work together to fabricate a false virus
Do you think everyone in the world of science has so little ethics as to not blow that conspiracy open right now
I grew up in Somme (where the dreadful battle of the Somme happened), it gives some perspective on what war is like when it happens on your own turf
No, not strange at all
I love in Paris: most streets have some kind of war memory & it shows
You’ll be having a walk, passing in front of a primary school, and suddenly there’s list of names: Jewish kids who studied here & were murdered
Same goes with some parks, when the kids were to young to even go to school
And there are plates everywhere of soldiers & resistance members who died during the liberation of Paris
It’s kind of hard to make these events sound distant when you have reminders at every corner
Plus, my grandparents were young adults during the war, and I’m only 20
It really was not that long ago, one/two generations
Little enough time that I’ve heard family history/tales about it
WWII is relatable
My grandfather was a soldier, I heard his horror stories
And beyond my personal story, the siren blast monthly, the buildings have bullet scars, there's memorial plaque for every person shot for fighting or resisting, plaques in schools with the lists of kids that were deported
We can't forget but it's a good thing because we shouldn't forget
War has been the default setting of Europe for so long, peace is stranger than war
Never understood war, guns or violence
Never know it so, no
I lived in Lille, a northen French city that has been bombed the shit out of it for various reasons, it was weird seeing building that survived the bombing, next to brand new building , next to post war ones
I now live in Paris and two street next to where I live used to be a gestapo hq
That kind of stuff is everywhere in europe and works as a reminder that long time peace is something that a lot of people paid a hard price for
Apparently here, there's only 12 municipalities (out of the country's 36
000 in total) where no conscript died in WW1
In the north-east, close to the border with Germany, there are also several dozens of villages that have been completely leveled and never rebuilt, sometimes because there was too many unexploded ammunition a still lying around
Out of these, 6 municipalities have a mayor, but no inhabitants, and he's officially appointed by the state to maintain the memorials in these villages
Same for my hometown Lorient
There was a German submarine blockhaus near her, the allies bombers have destroyed the whole city but the blockhaus is still there, not even damaged and today it's a museum
It does make a difference because "your country" refers to the government
The government started the wars
Not some random grandparents
>  cause it is still your grandparents
No it's not, you were "lucky" that the person you talked to did have a Nazi Grandpa
But that's it
Also, you don't know the age of the perso you're talking to
You could speak to a 21 year old, and I bet his or her grandparents didn't start anything
It blasts every first Wednesday of the month at noon
The revolution led to the creation of the metric system and put a lot of ressources to force its utilization so I don't think we have much
I only heard my father use a pound (0
5kg) once
In French there's the archaic "lieue" that is roughly 4km long, and the measurement system of the Middle Ages that used pi, phi (golden number) and the metre in its relations before they were even (re)discovered
In France, we usually count with baguettes until 3 or 4 years old
Well, we Invented Metric
So, not really traditional (even if it's a few centuries old) and not special anymore since it spread around, but I think it kinda counts for your question
~~All to say, our measurement is stronger than your measurement system
Some areas of France, mostly rural, have unofficially kept pints (pintes) and pounds (livres) only for milk and bread
Both weigh 500g.
We also have the quintal here
Le cirque de Gavarni in France is just otherworldly
Interesting that everyone puts Notre Dame in Paris first
There is [the cathedral of Reims] which was built around the same time, with the same kind of gothic style, but is more sophisticated (statues everywhere) and historically important in France's history
Agree that the Mont Saint Michel has a better place in this list though
Honestly, I get it
I’m Jewish and my family were ravaged by the Shoah but I don’t think it’s inappropriate to include something like that here
When we talk about a wonder of the world, it doesn’t mean something that’s really, really brilliant
It’s something impactful and doesn’t have to be spectacular because it’s beautiful or a source of good
The Pyramids aren’t a Wonder because everybody loves elaborate tombs for rich blokes that were probably built by slaves
You’re all listing the Colosseum but nobody thinks that forcing prisoners to fight for their lives against wild animals is the pinnacle of entertainment
It’s about the place these places have within European heritage and tbh I can’t think of anywhere more powerful
I've never heard of this before, I am truly amazed
I knew the Dutch were the world's best for these kinda stuff but it's still impressive
Look at the actual Wonders
They’re not on the list because they’re wonder*ful*. They’re there because they’re of immense importance to world heritage
It doesn’t mean “wow this is really, really great”. The Coliseum is where prisoners and wild animals were forced to fight to death in the most barbaric conditions
The Pyramids were probably built by slaves and forced labourers to give some rich bloke a fancy tomb
Nobody’s saying “oh wow, that’s brilliant”. They’re on the list because they’re spectacular, innovative, and yeah, often terrible but they’d had such an impact on the culture of a country (and beyond) that they are remarkable
Yeah I learned some stuff about the Netherlands lmao, like almost half the country is below sea level
I suddenly love you
Uh because European culture *was* twisted into blind hatred for a people who bore no guilt
You can’t pretend that it wasn’t a massive cultural shift which continues to impact us for generations
The Jewish people of Europe have *never* recovered from being almost entirely wiped out
You can pretend like this is all in the past, and yet my adoptive grandma whose own cultural beliefs forbid tattoos, has a tattoo on her arm with the numbers that were her identity instead of her name
There are still fewer Jews in the world now than there were before the Shoah
Our numbers have never recovered from what several European culture allowed to happen
Where are the missing tens of millions of my Jewish brethren who should be here now and where are their own distinct cultures which were wiped out
I’m very happy for you that you get to sit safe at home in Austria and think “What does a concentration camp have to do with European culture
” but, as I’d like to tell you from my Jewish community in England, from my synagogue that’s had swastikas carved into the walls: Aushwitz has *everything* to do with European culture but it seems some people have the privilege of forgetting that
Love

Joking :)
Drinking Wine, mostly
I guess French culture is known for a sum a things that you learn to appreciate with time
When i was a tadpole, i thought the french left not going lib-dem flavour was somewhat backwards
And you know you face a conflit because you want to vouch for you country to feel like part of the goodies but you also got tv up in a corner of a room whispering you what's cool according to a board of obnoxious old farts
Now i don't vouch so much for what makes talk show hosts wet
French humanities classics never hyped many (french) teenagers, while they're worth giving a shot later in life – or sooner
Also, the place for meals in daily life start making sense as you begin your career
Those meals have nothing about gastronomy, nor sustentation or a political stance, but are an attempt at something tribal, mindful, that infuse some meaning in your work day
And then comes the things i came to hate…
Yes, speaking Basque is my dream
Nah, but my family have tried to make me drink wine since I was 12
They said Latin alphabet
Wok to walk, made in Amsterdam, it's in every major city, even a few in France, but none in Paris
We still use email/mail
I never heard someone ask for a gmail
(also, nobody says the "proper" word aka "courriel")
Absolutely no one except maybe some official documents use "courriel", everyone says "mail"/"email".
No one uses courriel
It's the same thing for "texto" honestly
I haven't heard anyone use the word in years, everyone around me says SMS
However, I think they both are the official french words though, as defined by the Académie, which is why they are used by journalists, authors, and the government
For "GSM" though, that's just the name of the standard for 2G network protocols
Using it to mean mobile phone is the same as saying "gmail" for "email".
Southern France
"texto" *is* used just not a lot compared to SMS, maybe I just don't notice it when it is
england
Germany
italy/roman empire
spain
austria
Is it normal to feel sad when I don't see France in the top 3
Monaco
United Kingdom
Italy
Andorra
Spain
There are two that are very important: Germany and the UK
There is the major ones: Italy and Spain
Maybe the Habsburgs, the US and Russia at some point but really other countries aren't nearly as important as those 4
I mean I think people already do learn our country's history
England
Germany
Maybe Italy because of François Ier and Napoléon ?
Yeah, we're a pretty self centered people, I know
>  Basque country
What is the link between the Basque and Iceland ? Never heard of such connection tbh
> Honourable mention of France
I mean France wasn't that involved in the area until the 19th century I'd think your neighbors might be above no ?
Nincs is Franciaország? Úgy értem, Tr*anon
I wish the auld alliance was talked about more over here
I never heard about it in school and had to search before stumbling upon it
> helped us counter England
Hell yeah we can help anyone as long as it annoys the rosbifs
Austria above Algeria
I would definitely add Scotland
Italy waaay above Russia
I'm a bit curious about what France did with Iceland
Seems a bit difficult since the Gauls weren't a country, Greece wasn't united, and there is probably something about Israel too
depends what you count as algeria, then independant entity that lasted until today, ok sure we learn more about them
&#x200B;
but the area and the people are older then that and before that france only played a minor role in the area
I mean Algeria didn't exist before France created it so basically they have been ours for like 100 years and have been a close but not so close relationship for 60 years
The US  are way above Algeria for example
Imo Austria is a good pick because it has been around for a long time and has always been a powerhouse of Europe
There is probably a lot to say about Russia, the Ottomans, the North and Portugal too and we might also count the great kingdoms of the middle age that have dissapeared today like Burgundy or Provence but Algeria is really far behind
Try asking questions about Maori and New Zealand
Also this is about Europe, no need to bring other painful memories
Many European countries did horrible things
Yeah, It's Italy that should be there (heck I'd put them above Spain and Austria), between the link between the monarchy and the papacy, and the numerous French kings who made a hobby of trying to plunder northern Italy, or their link with the Naples thrones, the fights with the Austrians/Spaniards there, Renaissance we copied from them
Way too many link with Italy to not put them in the top 5
Are the programmes very different between the landers
Didn't knew that, I thought it was mostly because of France involvement in a lot of Ottomans dismantlement shenanigan and WW1
Well TIL for the law inspiration I guess
Thanks for the answer
Now that I think about it we didn't talk a lot about the 100 year war to begin with, so I guess that's why
Sorry, I had misundertstood your intent
I am old, so I remember very well the Greenpeace boat
I remember French speaking usenet was unusable for a while, full of new zealanders insulting French people
It was a sad time
Thanks for the infos
Always nice to learn new things
> that Napoleon said "give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world"
I seem to remember a Polish comment on reddit saying he said the same thing about Polish soldier, so it's either something he said multiple time, or he at least said something like that at some point (for whom though ?)
Ban
Nah
Regulate
Yes
I actually don't mind lootboxes
As far as I know, the issue is that kids / "weak" people may spend way too much money on those things without noticing
This is due to microtransactions, not lootboxes
Yes, both sometimes come together, but so does most of the pairs of things you can think of
There are even games with lootboxes that you can't buy but only earn through playing the game
If a regulation should take place, it should be about how microtransactions are integrated to games
For example you should be able to block yourself for spending more than a defined amount
Also the presence of microtransactions should be indicated the same way PEGI are, that way the parents would be able to control the spending of their children (unless they are bad parents, but regulations can't really correct that), and people that have issues with gambling could decide to avoid the game
About the "gambling" nature of lootboxes
Well, I get your point: some people completely loose their mind when gambling
There could be regulations to make that more sane, like making it clear what exactly you can get in your box (most of the games I play already do that, so maybe this regulation already exists
), or having an available setting that makes the website unable to validate payments (so that if you purchase something thinking it was free you just get told it actually wasn't free, and don't loose your money), like if you never gave them your payment infos in the first place
Especially since they most likely know the back end (aka what's in the lootboxes)
Fortnite doesn't have lootboxes, at least where the big money is made, aka not Save the World
Epic is even pulling them from Rocket League
F2p will take over gaming by 2025 no matter what, lootbox ban or not
r/Yurop
Yurop
is now reaching new frontiers, and sending men where no one else wa before
The colony on the moon Europa, called "Yurop 2" was established some years, and it seems that Yuropean unity has no limits
In the near future, if we don't succeed in counteracting the big rise of nationalist thought, who knows what will happen
If we don't reform quickly the obsolete unanimous vote Europe is running towards disintegration, we need a strong political Europe more than ever
(It also implies the power to eject habitual abusers
Probably not very different from the rest of earth : a mess of a wasteland where humans have to use force to stay alive
This being said, it'll probably be a very old population, as it's already pretty bad now and will get only worse
Controlled by the CCCP
This post is about envisioning 100 years in the future, dude
Not telling what you wished for 50 years ago
Don't worry my over-the-Rhine neighbor, the EU is important to a lot of people here too
Some euroscepticism exists of course, but to me, EU is the only way Europe can compete in the future
And I do feel European, but I still feel French
It's a weird mix
In France they are weird-clown parties
They won few towns in municipal elections recently and they are now famous for their weird statements, such as cyclism competitions are sexist and they don't want that in their towns, or Christmas tree is a dead tree and we should not encourage people to party around dead tree
Stuff like that
And we've landed spacecrafts on comets and asteroids
No, youth in France also have a strong EU identity, same thing for every founding nations
Not all youth
RN party has litteraly the most support from youth
I'd say there is more a european sentiment rather than a will to have an european nation
You are way too optimistic
And my France !
Since French was one of the instigator of the EU, and as been heavily implicated in the WW2, I would say that yes, indeed, there’s a strong connection, I would even say that’s why Germany and France are perceived as the two “leaders” of the EU
You guys need to make a difference between the European identity and European federalism
Doesn’t the RN like to encompass on the European Identity, with his Christian roots and Roman heritage ? Obviously yes, it doesn’t mean that they support the European Union though, but they sure support the idea of the European Identity
"The franco-german couple" is a common saying here
I would say that there is a lot since the meme community in France is huge on Facebook
Theses groups, called neurchi are specialized on one subject and are often really creative
For instance neurchibald de tintin is a neurchi focused on making memes with the comic Tintin and are really funny
We have bad jokes about fishes on r/rance
That's all I could think about
Yeah, translating everything in bad French for example (attends, c'est tout France ? - Toujours a été) but we have plenty of them
Tintin is widely known so template used in French can be translated and understood to someone abroad, to a certain extent of course
Kaamelott memes on the other hand, if you don't speak French and don't have the context I wouldn't know where to start to explain what it is
I’d say that the ones with OSS 117 are pretty much exclusive to France
I would add Denis Brogniart's "AH !", it can easily be translated even leaving as is, but I've never sen it anywhere other than French websites or used by French people
Et les memes de la Cité de la Peur aussi
Ouais, mais sinon
Snoop Doggy Dogg, qu'est-ce-qu'on attend ?
C'est pas faux
Other french memes can be :
* Palmashow  (based on two humourist videos)
* memes décentralisés (based on the struggles of the contryside's way of life)
* C'est pas sorcier (based on a child science show)
You can also find a niche in the JVC community, a video game forum which mascott is Risitas
J'appelle ça la France
Et pas n'importe laquelle, celle du général de Gaulle
> (Competing with the magnificent "salut" from fanta)
[TA GUEULE
C'EST PAS TOI QUI DECIDE
One of the most famous memes as well
Un classique !
Vous allez m'arrêter pour mangeage de choucroute interdire ?
Barrez vous cons de memes !
Is that your Schnappi ?
I'm also thinking about this absolute legend :
The madlad
Not the meme we wanted, but the meme we needed
What is you "brother" country ?
What is the country you have a more intimate relationship with that no other country has ?
Like for example, France and Belgium are very close as we share the same language, a patrimony somewhat related, etc
South of France, it can be Italy, Spain or Switzerland, especially since close to those countries, French is not the only language spoken (especially near Perpignan), and Switzerland with the Franco-German mix
However I’d say our real brother nation here is Monaco  ! (In particular since if the king does not have an heir, they would become French)
France has Wallonia (French-speaking part of Belgium) as a sister, as opposed to Belgium as a whole
Still love you Flemish people
Wow I didn't expect so many responses
Thank you guys very much
It is really interesting !
Historically speaking, I'd say first Italy with the roman empire, Germany with the Franks and Charlemagne, then England with the Normands
I personally feel more connected to Germany, coming from thé north easy of France
I do not consider Belgium a "brother" country the same way
Feels more like a twin (for wallony) or a member of my own body
Smth like this
None really, there has been a whole culture movement since the early XVIIIth century that sees Japan as our bizarro world equivalent but that's about it
Not sure where you heard about that France / Belgium brotherhood
Our brother country is Italy, no questions asked
It's like that brother you love, you share everything with but you hate at the same time
Similar food culture, luxuous countries, close latin language, Paris and Rome (Only Paris deserves Rome, and only Rome deserves Paris) , one of the oldest history on earth, café, terrasses, etc
Funny because French people don't see Germany as our brother country at all
I'd say it's Italy for France, Germany is more like our nemesis haha
Aber Deutschland liebe ich trotzdem, mit freundliche grüßen aus dem Elsass ;)
Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland are our three little kids
Belgium is a little disturbed but I'm still proud of what did the two younger
You eastern fellas are sometimes a mystery to us westerns
Ukraine deserves love
Real love
I kinda envy how close Northern countries are to eachother
A Danish friend of mine once explained to me that Northern relationships were a bit complicated to understand though
In a funny way I mean
Yeah it's some kind of brotherly relationship like there are some intense arguments but at the end of the day we still love each other
It really does haha
Funny how Netherlands and France are Belgium's big brothers, but they never relate together
France and Germany do have a big friendship, but I feel the Netherlands are closer in terms of patrimony etc (correct me if I'm wrong)
I’d say Germany, because of trade, but agreed that’s not really felt in southern France (neither, I guess, is it when you’re in Lille and work with Belgians daily)
I would never have guessed tbh
Huh
I don't feel that at all
I worked 2 times in Germany, I did one Erasmus there, and (at least, for me) they are the closest brother of France
We are also making a "French-Germany" union quite often within the EU
For me, UK is more an nemesis, if I could say that
But a nemesis that we always take care and fight like a little sister
I feel differently
Maybe because I made more German friends than Italian while living abroad
There are differences, but at the end of the day we have similarities with all our neighbours
Well, Istria used to be part of Italy and it really shows
Beautiful place
I don't know, I never hear anything bad said about Switzerland in France, but it seems a Swiss person can't go a day without crapping on France
Don't get me wrong Germany is definitely very very close to France when it comes to cohesion, cooperation and economic development
But in term of culture, living style and history, I don't think that Germany is close to us at all, especially if compared to Italy
Mais je suis d'accord avec toi dans l'absolu, je vis en Alsace et la cohésion Franco-allemande est extrêmement développée et présente, et j'ai beaucoup d'expérience avec l'Allemagne tout comme toi haha ;)
The Norwegians have it good I see
Sorry, I don't understant what's funny about that joke
Mon expérience est plus proche de ce que je vois sur ce thread, dans lequel je ne vois pas de critique des suisses
mais bon c’est juste mon expérience
Je comprends plutôt bien le message d'origine, et je n'ai jamais appris l'espagnol
Je ne comprends pas forcément les mots individuellement, mais le sens des phrases est assez facile à deviner
Je comprends encore mieux les messages en Italien, mais j'en ai fait un peu au collège et au lycée... Je ne serais plus capable de parler mais i' me reste forcément des notions
Donc c'est très facile à lire pour moi
J'ai plus de mal avec les commentaires qui sont dans d'autres langues
Je pourrais sûrement réussir à les déchiffrer mais ça me semble plus compliqué que l'espagnol et l'italien
Je parle pas mal de langue mais des latines je parle français, italien et espagnol
. Du coup j'ai très bien compris ce que tu as écris
Il faut dire que j'ai beaucoup de mal avec le catalan et le roumain
Et des légères complications avec la compréhension du portugais
Sinon ça va
Et toi t'as compris ?
J'ai étudié l'espagnol et puis l'italien à l'école donc forcément j'ai de la facilité à comprendre les commentaires dans ces langues
Avant, le portugais me paraissait complètement abscons mais après avoir étudié les différences systématiques entre portugais et espagnol, c'est devenu très facile à lire
Le catalan est aussi facilement compréhensible malgré le fait que je ne l'ai jamais étudié. En revanche le roumain reste très compliqué même si on devine certains mots
Il existe déjà un projet sur l'intercompréhension entre langues romanes :
Cette méthode vise à développer des stratégies de lecture pour deviner le sens de textes en langues romanes
Ce serait une bonne idée de créer un subreddit pour qu'on puisse développer ensemble l'intercompréhension entre romanophones !
Je ne pensais pas que j’en comprendrais autant
Mais ça demande de la concentration, surtout les premières phrases
Après un peu d’entraînement ça devient plus facile et on reconnaît plus vite les racines commune
Même les terminaisons des verbes se ressemblent
C’est incroyable, avec un peu de travail on pourraient tous se comprendre dans nos propre langues, au moins à l’écrit
J'ai du mal à te comprendre, tu parles d'anglais à un moment, comme contrepoint aux langues latines
Je compreder plus ce que tu escrito dans ton deuxième paragraphe, mais c'est quand même un peu un jeu de devinettes
Ça peut valoir la peine de préciser que je n'ai jamais appris d'autres langues latines, ni vivantes ni mortes (juste anglais et allemand)
Je trouve l'italien un peu plus facile à comprendre que le castillan, catalan ou portugais
Les Roumains pourraient aussi bien me parler en chinois, je ne les comprendrais pas mieux
J'ai pu comprendre assez bien car j'ai fait espagnol au lycée même si je suis très mauvais
C'est une question très intéressante
Je vais poster un poème de ma composition car je trouve que c'est marrant :
Voici ce qui occupe toute ma pensée :
La clarté bleue de l'âme volante qui occupe le ciel,
Notre sœur la Lune et toute sa beauté.
Comment puis-je rester de marbre face à un tel miel ?
Je ne peux tout simplement pas
Elle me regarde
Comprendre une langue latine parce qu’on parle déjà français ? Pas convaincue
Par contre , avoir des facilités d’apprentissage surtout en espagnol, que la majorité des élèves apprennent en cours , ça oui , tout a fait
C'est pas drôle parce que j'ai suivi des cours d'espagnol pendant 5 ans haha
Du coup j'ai compris 100% de ce que tu as dis !
En vrai, avant de commencer à apprendre l'espagnol, je pouvais le lire un petit peu
Le français et l'espagnol se ressemble tout de même beaucoup !
Personnellement j'ai très bien pu comprendre le message d'origine, mais cette aisance est certainement due au fait que je fais de l'espagnol depuis plusieurs années
En ce qui est des autres langues latines, j'ai plus de mal à les comprendre mais elles restent globalement compréhensibles (au niveau du contexte de la phrase ou du texte) à l'écrit, et je pense que beaucoup de français peuvent dire la même chose
Merci pour ce post original et intéressant au passage !
J'ai personnellement entièrement compris tes phrases en espagnol, sûrement parce que j'étudie cette langue en cours
J'arrive à peu près à comprendre l'italien et le portugais (seulement à l'écris), mais l'allemand et le roumain c'est autre chose
Je ne m'attendais pas à autant d'Italiens
Salut, je triche forcément un peu pour ton post vu que je parle déjà espagnol, en revanche c'est toujours plaisant de voir qu'on se comprend très bien entre langues latines
A l'écrit en tout cas
J'imagine qu'à l'oral ces différent
J'espère que vous allez tous bien et qu'on va pouvoir sortir de chez nous bientôt.
J'ai compris la majorité de ce que tu as dit
J'ai compris une bonne partie de l'OP, et quand je regarde les différentes conversations dans ce thread, j'en comprends une bonne partie
J'ai un peu plus de mal avec le portuguais et le roumain que l'italien et l'espagnol par contre
J'ai à peu près tout compris, mais j'étudie l'espagnol donc c'est normal
J'ai aussi beaucoup de facilités avec l'Italien, et je ne sais pas pourquoi mais le portugais est plus dur
Le roumain est par contre étonnement compréhensible
98% mais c'est parce que j'ai étudié l'espagnol a l'école sinon je comprendrais pas et je comprendrais encore moins l'italien et le portugais
Je crois que de toutes les langues le français est la plus éloignée du latin c'est pour ça que notre orthographe est moins intuitif c'est parce qu'il garde la structure des mots latins avec une autre prononciation
Romance or Roman ? IDK, I am ignorant French :)
Anyway, I vaguely understood your post, especially last question, while not speaking Russian at all
Ahahah :)
Je pense que c'est parce que j'étudie un peu l'espagnol mais j'ai un peu compris ce que tu as dit ! C'est trop bien !
J'ai compris 99% de ce que tu as dis, je suis pas sur du mot "spiegare", comprendre ?  Au début je n'arrivais pas du tout à comprendre l'italien mais ça fait deux semaines que j'essaye d'apprendre la langue avec duolingo
Je sais également parler portugais et espagnol assez bien, du coup par chevauchement ça aide avec l'italien
I don't understand trainstation ??
I only know extremely basic stuff for german and "Ich versteh nicht" is one of the first thing I learnt haha
Je parle le francais et l'espagnol, et j'ai etudie l'italien a l'ecole, mais la je comprends rien du tout
Everything but I learnt latin and I read Ceasar's commentaries so there's that
Well, I almost instantly recognized what this was from, so it was pretty easy
Caesar also purposely wrote in very simple terms because he wanted everyone to understand what he was saying (this was read aloud on the forum so even illiterate people could understand), so I'd generally have an easier time with this than with your average Latin sentence
Also, I did two two years of Latin in middle school
Vous y perdez sur l'allemand et les autres langues germaniques, mais ça doit quand même aider pour comprendre les langues latines, non
Ya genre 30% de votre vocabulaire qui est directement tiré de l'ancien français (avec juste une aphérèse ici et là)
TIL, thanks
oof , là c'était plus compliqué. mais je pense avoir compris quand même aussi !
Eine wunderschöne Antwort
Danke
In France, we also throw rice at the newlyweds, but after they exit the town hall
> aqwured
Just to let you know it's spelled 'awkward', but I really love your spelling
It would make life easier, that's for sure
Do you have 'funny' letters that are pronounced a certain way
I'm thinking of some languages, where 'c' at the end of a word is said 'ch'.
Super interesting, many thanks
I'm guessing Cyrillic is what is normally written
Keep it the same
It’s the regional flag I’d rather redesign
I wouldn't , I love my Flag : Simple , easy to reconize and has inspired a ton of other flags
Note to self : rosbeefs have dumb dumb flag
Tricolour good
Personnellement, j'aime bien celui utilisé par le conseil constitutionnel avec la brodure RF au centre
You're reall trying to make a french and a brit agree ?
Dude this doesn't piss off the americans so I can't agree
No worries, I was joking
But TBH tricolours have existed since the dawn of ages we didn't invent the thing
We didn't invent it but we made it popular
Now that's the spirit !
In France in some famillies (not sure abt most) it can be normal to ask a young adult to participate to the familly budget if he/she is making money and staying home
This is to give them an hint of the value of money and also give them a voice on how home is supposed to function ...
&#x200B;
But also many famillies (more mediteranean i believe) won't ask any money and some other will ask full money and give something back ...
&#x200B;
I guess here,just like anywhere else, you will find all possibilities
I think so
Really depends on the family tho
If you have a job, I think it's kind of expected that you at least contribute to the household spendings
I've heard multiple cases of parents charging full-on rent, tho at discounted rates usually
I've never heard of parents charging rent
We don't have a national pet as far as I know, we do have the rooster as our national animal though
Why is his name "papillion" ? It's butterfly in French lmao
I love him
This
I was not even into football at the time, and I know about him
Ooh I see thanks
French looks like you decided to try and get more points playing Scrabble by adding as many letters as you can
It’s either :
- beautiful language
- gay ass language
Either "Baguette language" or something like this (i can only think of this cliche
The only direct comment I got was that it sounded sensual
My Italian roommate told me that after overhearing me talking to my mother about banking
I suppose it depends on where the foreigner comes from:
Outside of Europe, I usually have people tell me that French sounds beautiful
Once, someone told it sounds like silk on skin, which surprised me because we have guttural and nasal sounds which can be off-putting for some
Speaking of, if they come from Europe they usually describe it as a mix of Italian and Spanish but worse
And that's the nicest one I have heard
We don't have a good reputation as I have come to discover from this sub :(
And there is this idea that it’s uselessly complex (the grammar)
But I don’t know if people really think that way or if it’s just a thing French people tell each other
I've been living in Netherlands, and heard many germans speaking there
Dutch is so much worse than german
German is so soft as a language, it really feels germans people can't do no harm
And then there is the dutch, which sounds like they are going to murder you when they ask what's for dinner
Lol you killed me
I laughed so hard
Thanks for that
(Same happens with French, which is probably the reason why I can relate: “je t’aime, vive la France, Tour Eiffel, café, où sont les toilettes ?”)
It’s nice, sounds very music-y. I think that’s where the Lord of the Rings comment comes from (it could also be that Tolkien used Irish to craft some of his languages
Don’t know but it doesn’t seem like a silly thing to think)
But then, I never heard someone speak Irish, just went to a museum where the audios were in both English and Irish
There’s this idea that it’s musical, though, because of the way you accentuate the words
My English teachers always told me to thinks of the English sentence as a landscape with little hills (I’m French)
You’re the second Irish whose comment I’ve read here, and now I badly want to know if Tolkien studied Irish language
Edit: it does sound music-y, btw, I like it
Not trying to be mean, but what you described is exactly what I imagine when I hear spoken Dutch
Thats funny because i never heard it like that
I did hear "discount italian" though
Thatt one had me crack up
I for once always thought it was a legend, glad you confirmed it
I think that it might be that both Italia and French are hard to learn for English-peaking people
The imperfect and transpassato subjunctive (subjonctif imparfait et plus-que-parfait) are still used but either in a very very very specific context, or when written
It’s true that people will think you’re posh if you used those like it’s an everyday thing
I had a teacher last year that wanted our whole class to use it all the time as a joke (I’m studying littérature and won’t bore you with more details
Last thing: we do use the subjonctif (“je pense que tu serais”, it just means something else)
The spelling actually makes sense when you look at it’s etymology
For example, we write “hôpital” (hospital) with this accent because there once was a -s before that -p. Those exact accent is always used to show that a -s disappeared
Same with other things, really: it all comes down to etymology
I find it fascinating
People usually keep that one for French men they meet, I think
I’m a woman and nobody ever told me that one, it’s hilarious
Haha, an English man once told me every French word he knew in a single sentence: the end was “Garçon, où sont les toilettes s’il vous plaît ?” Always wondered where that came from
“Que tu saches”, sorry
I’m not used to the names of these things in English (and, to be honest, I use these correctly -as far as I know- but am terrible at naming them
You might be a beginner but you’re already better at it than I am
We would say “I faut que tu saches ça avant de prendre ta décision” (You need to know this before taking a decision -is that proper English
Sounds very French to me) for example
As for the specific things, it’s more about present subjonctif: we use it for past things (Il aurait fallu que je le fasse avant de partir/I should have done it before leaving) but it’s just not very common because it’s formal language
It’s not that you never hear them, more that it’s rare
If someone tell me “Il aurait fallu que je finisse mes devoirs”, I won’t find it that strange but I might notice it (in a “oh, a bit unusual” but not in a “what’s this thing
” kind of way)
As for the imperfect subjonctive, it fell out of use but we still read it, as it’s used in lots of novels for example
Also, I’m not sure I get your example
And I really want to ask why, for the “you think you are” thing
To be honest, I only have one friend that studied Italian and he once said that the language was not that tricky
except when it comes to verbs
He said that it was a little similar, in that way, to Spanish: it’s roughly easy to learn the basics, but becoming fluent is way harder -most notably because of the tenses
Exactly the same on the conditional
“Je pense que tu serais un bon maître” is grammatically correct but this use of the word “maître” mostly fell out of use, it sounds like something a student from the 1930s would say -it’s very “vieille France”. We’d rather use the word “professeur” (cut down to “prof” in casual conversation)
I get what you say about the infinitive, though it’s not the way we use it in French
We go at it the same way English do, “I think that Marcus is good”/Je pense que Marcus est bon, gentil” (“good” really sounds like food in this context)
Sometimes we turn the verb into a word, this might be the French version of the infinitive
“Je pense que Marcus est une bonne personne” (I think Marcus is a good person)
(Also, side note: some French authors, such as Jean de La Fontaine, really admired this construction of the sentence in Latin
He wrote that the Latin sentence has a briefness and clarity that French could not achieve
We can use infinitive sentences (where the verb is an infinitive), but it’s uncommon
It’s a translation but I think that “être ou ne pas être” (to be or not to to be) would be an example of such a sentence
Again, I think that French and English are similar here
I don’t know why we translate the names of famous people and places
Believe mec it can be a nightmare
My current studies do that I have to learn English to French translation (and French to English, for that matter): sometimes we translate those, but sometimes we don’t bother
If a well-known translation exists, I’m supposed to use it, otherwise I have to let things as they are
We do that for fictional characters, too: Frodo from Lord of the Rings became Frodon in Le Seigneur des Anneaux, but Aragorn stayed Aragorn
A nightmare
I think that it comes from a translation usage at a time
And probably from days when people were afraid that French culture would disappear/melt and be replaced by English, too
(It my be a spelling mistake but we say Baudelaire, not Boudlaire
And we also say Kepler and Bacon)
As for the accent
we do not really think about it on an everyday basis
It might come, for a part, from the same habit of “frenchising” (franciser) names, or from a lack of understanding of the correct pronunciation
Lots of my friends don’t put the correct accents simply because they feel ridiculous, knowing that they do not achieve the right tone anyway and that it seems strange (I do this too)
French is not a very accentuated language, I think, and if it is I’m not aware of it, so when we try to accentuate things it often comes out forced and not very natural
I think that you’re right on French people: we don’t like to say it, but we are indeed nationalist on that we are often proud of our country
Because of our history, regional identities are not really a thing, but those that are are kind of strong -most of them
Also, these regions often feel very French no matter what (never, never
tell an alsacien that they are not French
Very bad idea)
(Also, thanks for the talk, I’m really enjoying it though I don’t know Italian at all, and I learned a ton of things already
Thank you Finland for your great music bands

Much love to you Scottish guys
France for beer
You might as well thank us for our fries
We also have laws against hate speech FWIW, though I certainly agree Germany has been at the forefront in that particular area, for obvious reasons
Of course you would
The price of neutrality
But your country is the one everybody admires and no one hates
This is an incredible achievement
And thanks for the raclette too !
Thanks for Marina Rollman, she's absolutely awesome
Plus the UK for food, Germany for wine, and Italy for trustworthy politicians
Yes, I do
Last year, my neighbors didn't lock their door when they went to the grocery store (5 minutes away from our building) and in the span of 10 minutes, their apartment was burgled
Also as a woman living alone, I would never feel safe knowing my door isn't locked
But that's probably because I live in a city with lots of weird and creepy people
Yes but only because my toddler like to open it and try to take the elevator by himself
If he's not here I don't: there is no handle on the other side so you need the key to open it
I our country house we only lock it at night
During the day it's safe outside (no car or anything, we know well every neighbors (all of them have our key) and anyway if someone enter the house is 3 centuries old: every step is loud so we would here it even if you're watching a movie on the second (thirds for american) floor
If we're out of the village, we don't lock it either: elderly neighbors are more efficient than any security camera to spot a stranger
I do because it reminds me of taking the keys with me when I go out
My door do not have an handle on the outside
I didn't in France (rural) but some English chick keeps coming in, uninvited, i bought a post office it's pretty amusing grannies asking for stamps when I'm eating breakfast
When i know that someone is coming let say 9h i left it open at night, if not nah recently
I live in rue Ordener, Paris 18, so yes
When I'm at home : keys locked on the door
And I have a 3 points lock
Je suis un mec et j'ai deux gros chiens
Du coup je laisse ouvert et si yen a un assez con pour ouvrir ça me fera des économies de croquettes
[Tribute]
Same here
I’d gladly lock it during the night only but I know I’d forget to do it
So just to be safe I lock it as soon as I arrive home
I've had a drunk man knock on my door once (the door of the building doesn't work well sometimes, I guess he took this opportunity to enter the building)
He was quite aggressive and I was glad my door was locked
Djaune méïde iz ouai tou eu taveurn srou zeu darke forèste, aunely tou faïnde ahoute zate i faurgote ze meuni
We don't have the "th" sounds, so I replaced /θ/ with /s/, and /ð/ with /z/.
Djone méid hiz wée tou eu taveurn trou ze dark foreste, aunnely tou faïnde aoûtte zat hi foregotte ze moné.
French :
Djone méïde iz ouéille tout euh taveurne srou ze d'Arc foreste, oneli tout faïnde août zat i forgotte ze moni
"Jaune maid iz waye tau a taverne trou zeu dark forresst, onli tau finnde oute zat i  faurrgaute zeu mauni"
In French, "i" is pronounced "e", and "ou" is pronounced "oo"
John a trouvé son chemin jusqu'à une taverne à travers une forêt sombre, tout ça pour remarquer qu'il a oublié son argent
In French
I was about to post my attempt at a French "translation" but your answer is perfect
You went to great lengths to try and keep French pronunciation rules
Looking at this, one can really appreciate how different English sounds are from French
The frequent use of the letter "z" and of the tréma ï as well as the overall lack of vowels make it look decidedly un-French
Southern France (Marseille); true, I forgot that the way we pronounce our "o" sounds is different than most francophones
Another reason for "Djaune" rather than "djonne" is that, at first, I wrote the sentence using french words whenever possible (ouais, euh, tout, goth for "forgot"), before changing my mind
Jaune survived the changes I made
Freedom of expression and islamism
It's a tough subjects because 5M french are muslim
A professor actually got decapitated a couple weeks ago
The problem is there is a lot of things happening and I feel like they are trying to divide the country
We need to win a world cup asap so everyone calms down
That’s a great post OP, with informative answers
Mods, how about making this a semi-regular thread that allows us to hear about and discuss trending topics in fellow European countries ?
Of course I know that it's been a week that they're shitposting us on twitter and they're hacking our websites
Of course Erdogan jumped on that to criticize Macron
He also encourage turks to boycott french products
Thank you for this comment, because got to be honest the way this is escalating I feel like France position is more and more isolated and I'm quite disappointed by the involment of other EU members and EU by it self
Don't know if it's because they don't support those values, don't understand how those are important to us, or just overall don't give fuck because "hey what are values when money is at stack ?".
Don't know if EU realise how sensible this subject is for the french but not taking a firm position behind us on this one will damage durably french trust in EU
Until now I was pretty certain France would shift right inevitably, but adding this I'm more and more afraid we might skip that and go strait to nationalist with Frexit etc
and this will be the start of a whole new kind of mess
I actually thought everyone heard of it when I posted it
Otherwise I would've put more details
It's not about calm but for a month the country was united and that's kinda rare
No indeed Erdogan encouraged the boycott
In Qatar it's a company that first banned french products in its stores
I don't know for the other countries but I think they just complained about what Macron said
Either Polytechnique (nicknamed l'X) for their engineering programs or Ecole Normale Superieure (nicknamed Normal sup) fir their liberal arts programs
As someone who lives close to Andorra and has been there multiple times
Yeah Andorra is the very definition of uninteresting
EDIT : typo
Luxembourg, Netherlands, the Baltics, Ukraine, Belarus, the first ones that pop into my head
Edit: Adding North Macedonia to that list
I always kinda forget that Lithuania is there, Estonia got Talinn, which somehow became a tech hub in the region, Latvia got the fastest wifi in the world apparently, but Lithuania ? What’s in there ? Is it worth visiting ? What makes it special ?
Moldova is probably the only country I know nothing about in Europe
I mean, I know the flag, but
What languages are spoken
What is the capital city
How many people live there
When was the last time someone mentioned Moldova in the news
I don't know, I felt Luxembourg had nothing of this
It randomly became a country for historical reasons, but couldn't find the associated culture
>The fries
Ah yes the French Fries from Belgium
Pretty surprised by Netherlands too, as Amsterdam is an extremely popular destination
I love Maastricht also, but it's true some cities have a poor reputation, like Rotterdam
Even then you can skii on the French side (I don't know about the Spanish one)
For me on the French side it's simply more convenient (and perhaps even cheaper) to go to La Jonquera instead of going up there for liquor and cigarettes
40 minutes from Andorra la Viella or Pas de la Case/Casa ?
So does Spain and you don't have to go through mountain passes that are 2km high to go there
> If you're into beer, there's the smorgasbord of beer types, brands and flavors
Real talk: yes,; Belgium has the most diverse "traditional" beer culture, but it's 2020 and Belgian breweries are still super orthodox
As sad as it sounds, I think the US has way more beer styles, and consequently way more flavours
That's not a diss on Belgian beer though, that's what I grew up on
The triples are marvellous and Orval remains a favourite of mine, but it's not super varied
The football team
Good potential, but lack some panache
No trophies, no finals, no big matches (the win against Brazil was cool, but Brazil is just not the same anymore), I hope they'll really make an impression next cup
Scheiß Luxembourgeois toi-même d'abord
We couldn't really find a typical restaurant (that was 10-15 years ago), the center promoted restaurants from other countries in Europe to give an European feeling, but it felt like tourist traps to us
We tried to find something unique, but not so much luck
It could be we didn't go to the right part of town, I usually find something good quite easily
Hahaha stop taking the piss out of them
I like their team, but the loss against Wales in 2016 was a huge let-down and 2018 was just fine
Now, they are still first in ranking but look harmless
The nations league wasn't better
I hope for them they do something good next time, but it's possible they have missed their chance
I don't remember having so many problems finding something local in the hundreds of cities I have visited
City centers normally try to promote ''authentic'' stuff from there, in Luxembourg it was more advertising itself as a capital of Europe
And Luxemburg is just a small city of 100k inhabitants, not some kind of megalopolis where you cannot go through a large part of the city in a 1h walk
The first time I heard "Help yourself," I misinterpreted it as "You're on your own
Do you mean süß or niedlich
Because I definitely agree for niedlich, but I think for süß it's more context-dependent and it's def used to compliment women
"fuck" would be really gross when translated in french (by our standards
For such exclamation we would use "merde" (shit) or "putain con" (whore cunt) in the south
Which word is tolerable or harsh may vary from one language to another
But we use more and more english and the young generation adpots "fuck" a lot (en anglais dans le texte)
I think here it's more that some french people think "Fuck" is by default the short version of "fuck you". I've seen this happen with kids and adults who  can't speak English
Aaah I might have heard it mostly to describe a behavior actually, never appearance
I live in Bavaria btw
Yeah not just in Liège or even Belgium . I am from Lille and I always use « Merde » to wish good luck , I’ve also heard French people from the South or even Paris using it that way
Thanks, you too :) Let’s stay safe
I think germans haven’t been too bad at isolating for now compared to the French at least
Politicians are mainly corrupt here
But I would not Say I experienced corruption, because you can't corrupt a civil agent, a policeman, anyone working for the gouvernement
Only powerful people are corrupt in France
I think France is alright and corruption isn't a major issue right now
There is some, of course, but not enough to be considered a huge problem plagging the country . There is many pressions and influences from lobbies, however
When cops took my friend's weed they didn't fine him, they just took it to smoke it themselves
[We all know who we have to thank]
In term of classic music, I like :
-[Debussy - Clair de lune]
-[Erik Satie - Gymnopédies]
-[Camille Saint-Saëns - Aquarium] because disney
-[Camille Saint-Saëns - danse macabre] (strat the video at 4m10s and wait for it)
-[Yann tiersen - Summer 78]
I also enjoy :
-[Opa tsupa - les 2 guitares]
As much as I adore those songs I still think one of the most beautiful songs to come out of France has to be [la bohème ]
Oh wow, I’d never heard that before (but then I am Jewish and live under a rock) but it’s just gorgeous and their voices are beautiful
I love their clothes
I assume that’s the native dress
Is it common to see people dressed like this anymore
What kind of occasions is it worn for
Jacqueline du Pré is such an incredible cellist
I live in Lyon
I only talk to the neighbor living on the same floor as me, I don’t really know the name of anyone else in my building
I wake up everyday at 6:20, leave for work at 7:30 to take the subway to work, I clock in at 8:00 and I come back home between 5:30 and 6:00 pm
I mostly don’t talk to people in the street except if there is a specific reason like to complain with others strangers about our bus being late or things like that (complaining really brings people together in France) or if someone is lost and need information
I have a few friends in the city and we meet somewhat regularly to have drinks, play board games (we have board game bars) or play role playing game at home
Life is alright, I like having everything close by and the public transportation are mostly quite good so going anywhere rarely takes more than 30 minutes
I like going to the countryside to hike and whatnot but I would not like to live there
My grandmother lived in a very small village and I disliked the fact that everyone knows about your every action and gets involved in things that are your business
People in cities generally don’t care who you are, what you are up to or what you are doing as long as it does not concern them which I like
I live in Paris and have lived in Marseille, so I’ve only ever lived in larger cities (except for holidays)
It’s nice and all, but I guess I don’t really know what it’s like living elsewhere
My flat is something like 20mins to the Eiffel Tower, in central Paris (the 15e is a big neighborhood, but it’s also one of the places in Paris where you can be close to the center of town for relatively ok rent)
I have easy access to pretty much all the town, what with the subway, and with time I know where to go when I’m looking for a movie theater, theater, concert, cheap booze, good bier, museum, Japanese food, beautiful/calm/animated places, etc
Lots of my friends live in Paris & its suburbs, aka it’s rather easy to see one another
I know some of my neighbors, but most of them are strangers that I see once a year for the "neighbors party" (that’s a thing here)
We say hello when we meet, sometimes discuss a bit, but nothing more
The ones I know, though, we invite each other over
Don’t really know what to say
Good schools
That’s important: big city <=> good schools, in France (same goes for high school, uni, etc)
Very pretty, very safe, clean, good public transports
Lots of nature in the city and even more outside of it (but easily accessible)
A pretty good variety of restaurants and very good food
A bit expensive, but still doable
Not the most intense nightlife but that’s not a priority for me tbh
Amazing university environment, great for research with good accessibility to libraries etc
Great weather and very cyclable (flat and great cycling infrastructure)
Pretty nice people, but it’s not that easy to make friends
Good culture, plenty of museums and things to do all year long), same for general entertainment
Pretty much the perfect city for me tbh
Big enough that I still discover new things, streets, sights; but doesn’t feel overwhelming
I love it here
I was born in Paris and well it sucks, it's dangerous as hell, it's absolutely dirty, it's full of tourists and it's fucking expensive
Countryside and smaller cities >>>> Paris clearly
Des bisous de Valence, la ville qui se voudrait être Lyon mais qu'en a clairement pas les moyens x)
I just visited vienna, and holy shit i wanna live there
Its so well balance between a dynamic town with good infrastructure, and a chill place where you can have fun and relax
I wish they made Paris like that (i dont live there but its the biggest city, so it has potential), cleaning the big monuments and the pollution would make it such a great city
Il faut vous convertir à l’évangile selon Saint Bocuse, c’est votre seule chance de salut
I clock in and out so the later I arrive, the later I have to leave work and I hate getting back home at 19:00 more than I hate waking up at 6:20
Pour rien au monde j'abandonne les ravioles contres des quenelles
On se respecte un minimum à Valence quand même
I mean, it's pretty much a reality already for the Western part of the EU
We only need to expand it Eastward
Can’t agree more
I had the same idea and so did others here, I think it would be awesome
Thought I’m afraid I won’t be alive to see it fully complete, if it ever happen
>Architects and engineers should take inspiration from Japan and South Korea, where the high speed networks look super nice, clean and ultra-modern
I mean the South Korean train is a complete copy of the French one and was built by a French company so I don't see how they could inspirate us
That's my utopian dream as well :)
Well the two towers might be a good idea, but I’m not so sure about everything that goes with them
Otherwise a railway across Europe is a really good idea
That’s the first one I thought of
It already partly exists
It's called [eurovelo] Some routes are completed, like the 15th one, along the Rhine, along which I rode with some friends 2 years ago
I'm veeery excited about this, though some countries are slower than others in developing this project
It exists
It's the [eurovelo] network
Only a few routes are completed (15th and 6th I think, more more since then) but it's very exciting
I would build the dam all around England and fill it with the Baltic sea
Thank you
Can't believe how far down I had to scroll for that one
How long would that take ? A long train ride accross Eurasia sounds like a nice journey
We already have such a rail network here in France but there is one main cons : it's expensive to build and maintain
I can be built with EU fond, it's not really a problem if the politics have the will to, but then each lines operates at a loss and the train company's debt rise up to billion of euros
Because High speed train is an expensive technologie, it's difficult to fill a Paris-Lyon TGV (the only profitable line here) with a 80 to 120 euros ticket
A solution could be lower taxes or public subsidy
I completely agree with you, but what could prevent our politicians to agree about a project like this is its long-term economic viability
> more taxes on gas
Well, look up "yellow vest" on google and see what's going to happen lmao
While it's true that cars are used often when train would be better, many people, leaving in small cities/countryside, dont have munch money to begin with and have no choice but to use gas cars rn
Pretty sure the Creuse doesn't exists, its name literally means "Hollow"
In France there's Trifouillis-lès-Oies that really doesn't exist but we regularly talk about it or send people there
The existing alternative would be Plougastel-Daoulas, a small Breton village that serves the same purpose
Legend says even birds don't travel here
Sorry to ruin the joke and the contract but the whole Metal world fully knows that Finland is the center of the universe
For France everybody knows Louis
but we also have : Clovis, Clodomir, Thierry, Thibert, Thibaut, Childebert, Clotaire, Caribert, Sigebert, Chilpéric, Gontran, Dagobert, Pépin, Carloman, Charles, Eudes, Robert, Raoult, Lothaire, Henri, Hugues, Philippe, Jean, François
No women ever sit on the throne of France, so women names aren't avaible
Okay consider France the illegal abortion clinic then
You forgot Charlemagne ! And Louis-Philippe
Clodomir and Thierry
I love old French royal names
I’m sure you could use the names of the regents for women’s names, and local ones such as Anne de Bretagne
do not forget about louis-phillipe
Some left better memories than others, if Süleyman I left a good legacy, we can't tell the same about Abdülhamid II
If you count Seldjoukid rulers you have Tughrul, Malik,  Barkyaruq, Mahmud too
Pépin, Robert, Hugues, Louis-Philippe, Napoleon
The merovingians had many
interesting names, but I can't name them from memory
&#x200B;
No girls allowed
And Louis-Napoléon
It comes from Hlod (glorious) mir (great) in old frank
But yes it sound like old slavic name like Vladimir
Actually no, there were 4 reigning Clovis before the reign of Louis Ist (in 814)
So even if Louis is a late form of Clovis, both are treated as different names, otherwise it would have been Louis Vth and not Louis Ist
Because of that, it is pertinent to treat them as different names
I guess that half of those names were traditionnal among old germanic people and must exist in modern german
Well Charlemagne isn't a name, it is Charles le magne (Carolus Magnus) Charles le grand
He is count with the Charles actually
And concerning Louis-Philippe it is surely a name but it is a compound name and we already gave those names individually
Thierry is still used through
I'm still waiting to encounter someone called Clodomir or Childebert, this would be unbelievable
Here you go,  It comes from Hlod (glorious) mir (great) in old frank (close to Clovis= Hlodwig in old frank)
But yes it sound like old slavic name like Vladimir
More than that
It's between Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists
Yeah sure i don't challenge the fact that this name may be used for evocation
But those are in fact treated differently, so this is why i treated them differently
In France, Dora the explorer teaches little kids English
Are there shows that were changed as such to fit your country's market
Où est Chipeur ? Est-ce qu'il est derrière la porte ? Ou bien sous le bureau ?
In the 90's, French tv imported A LOT of Japanese cartoons, and would change all the names and locations
Apparently not
"Latino" usually refers to people from central/south america with a mix of European and native American ancestry (well it's mainly a cultural thing built around identifying as part of that population, of course)
A Spanish colleague of mine, from Madrid, spent some time in the US
He once checked "hispanic" on some admin forms, and got a WTF reaction from the clerk
On another occasion a Mexican restaurant worker congratulated him on his Spanish :)
Oh, miiiiiiiiiiince
Team mayonnaise
Same thing in Belgium with the two main pilsener beer brands: Jupiler and Maes
But everyone agrees that both are widely inferior to the real Belgian beers
Over, and cheese on top, the ham isn't soft enough on butt cheeks
Funnily enough it's masculine in french ( le Nutella, du Nutella )
I live in Brussels and Stella seems to be quite unpopular here
It's always Jupiler or Maes
However it's kind of my favourite between the three
I think it's really refreshing
Comparing France to the USA, we’re small
Joking, the thing is this is true for France but it’s also something I’ve seen in lots of little countries that is not that true for big: centralization
The fact that one big city has such importance, compared to all the others
Iceland, for example: I think something like 2/3 of the population lives in the capital
Why do the dutch have an obsession with the fact that their country is small
Besides calling a country small is relative, Kazakhstan is small compared to Russia but it's huge compared to Croatia
I love 3 (and 4, but I’m not sure I should laugh about that one quite as much as I did)
>pretty much identify as French
Wow really
Very surprising
It is but you don't see other (even smaller) countries go on about how small their country is
I lived in the NL, talking to many Dutch people and there's really something going on
Thanks, it's nice to have a real answer, I'm sorry to say Dutch people get easily offended when you criticize their country, I didn't want to talk about this "inferiority complex" first but I very much believe it's a thing
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I don't think we have especially famous song , but we have David guetta and Daft punk
we have Anissa from Wejdene, everyone was talking about how bad it is, making jokes, memes etc, nobody knows why but it became famous in the way that it has a lot of listening and it's at the radio
Meanwhile in France :
SAPÉ COMME JAMAIS, SAPÉ COMME JAMAIS !!!!!
> O-Zone - Dragostea din Tei
Dammmit Dammit, F*! i turned suddenly gay after watching that clip
People keep asking me What do the fox say as my in-game name is CowsGoMooMoo in Ow, never understood why
Terrible sound by the way, horrible i hate myself to listening to it twice
Dude
[Tomber la chemise] !
Also, that one about sardines
And Djadja, and Sur ma route, all that
No, Stromae is belgian
Oh yeah, this one is awsome
Except for the sardines,  not really
We're talking about cult summer songs
Think world Cup 98
I swear despacito and the sardines had the same effect on me: I never listened to it, yet I know it by heart and can’t stand the slightest sound of it
I don’t really think despacito (OP’s example) can compare to World Cup 98, it’s a “tube de l’été” more than anything
You don't have to apologize it's ok :D
Oh ok, I can understand that
Have a good day ! :)
Funny because we got the same problem in France with the EPR of Flamanville
The Vatry airport
They decided that to make the region of Champagne (the one where champagne is produced and there are more fields than people) more attractive by building an airport
Didn't really work as the airport is in the middle of nowhere, and Paris is like 2 hours away by car and 1 hour and a half by train
Also the Flamanville nuclear power plant
It exists since 1987 (Flamanville 1), then they built Flamanville 2, and in 2001 they started to build Flamanville 3
But it's been years and years, the construction still isn't finished (it's supposed to be finished in 2023) and it's costing a LOT of money
There's also been other problems, like the people nearby refusing to live near a nuclear power plant, or technical issues
The Notre-Dame-des-Landes airport near Nantes
They launched the project in 1963, Macron cancelled it in 2018
To make it short  : a lot people were against it (farmers, environmentalists etc)
They rioted and started to occupy illegaly the field in 2009
There were quite a few clashes with law enforcement
During Hollande's presidency, tensions grew for the Prime minister at that time was the former mayor of Nantes and supported the project
They organised a local referendum and 55% of the voters said they were for the airport's construction
In the end, the referendum was useless and people were still protesting and occupying the field until Macron cancelled it
You build thing faster when you don't care about the health of the worker weird right
The source of the problem is that all the four EPR construction projects to be build in France (Flamanville), Finland (Olkiluoto) and the UK (Hinkley Point C) are managed by EDF SA and its subsidiaries :)
Well it bring less jobs and money than if it was activated but it wasn't a complete waste of money
It ofc is but comparing it to china Is special lmfao
Since weeks, no pasta, no rice, no eggs, no canned food, etc
I live in Lyon and for now I have had no problem finding what I want
I haven't noticed it personally but I attended a Carrefour meeting and there indeed has been a huge impact on their stocks for essential products in hypermarchés all over France
I don't know if this will get seen but I wager that people are stockpiling toilet paper & water bc
they're cheap
It's not like people can stockpile gold etc .
Do you live where the virus is spreading hard perhaps ? Here in Auvergne I have not seen any difference in supermarkets
Really ? Haven't noticed shortages here (Yvelines)
Weird, I didn't notice any change in Lyon
Yeah
My local Waitrose, no toilet paper to be seen, yet the shelves are full of food and drink
People are fucking crazy; you can't eat toilet rolls (well, I suppose you could
The media should aknowledge their responsibility in this kind of situation but obviously they will never leave a chance for a spicy headline ...
Strasbourg supermarkets are stocked as usual
Île-de-France
No information about a big cluster here but shelves are empty since only 12 cases was announced for whole France
I have only seen pasta gone in Auvergne so far
I'm really glad they keep things closed on Sundays
I don't want to see our entire culture devolved into BUY THINGS even more
No issues in the North either
All normal in Paris too, surprisingly enough
Bordeaux, it's pretty normal but no hand sanitizer at all
I like Écureuil ( Squirrel ), the way it sounds and the way it is written make it a cute word
*Dépaysement*
It's the opposite of homesickness
The surprisingly pleasant feeling you can feel abroad or anywhere out of your usual personal comfort
*Affriolant* is more polite synonym of sexy
I like it
However in french it is the name of a laundry detergent, kinda ruins it
I directly thought of this one
"I'm going on an adventure !"
English is full of those, I really like the word "chop" for the exact same reason
Any too-american sounding name like Kevin, Brandon, Kimberley or Britney is a big :/
Fanny in France is a pretty popular girls name
Needless to say they get weird looks when they say their names in the UK
In France there was this trend in the 90s (especially in the most popular families) to call children American names because of popular tw shows and it didn't age well at all
Also the name Kevin is kind of the epitome of the stupid brat kid's name
Robert, Gontran, Monique, Thérèse
They're not awful but they sound quite old fashioned
However, genuinely bad named are some that used to trend in the 90s/2000s: Kévin, Ryan
Kevin,is just a bad name to give
I recently learnt that Chantal was a trashy name for kids in Germany and it feels weird because in France it's a quite common name among \~60-year-old women
Same for Jacqueline although they might be a little bit older
Jacqueline is an old women’s name in France
Several friends of my grandma used to be named Jacqueline
Exactly like,, children named Kimberley automatically are labelled as dumb
But honestly, can even imagine a Doctor Kimberley Dupont or a sergent general Brandon Lemoulin
Theres a super famous youtuber in france who is chinese and his name is kevin tran lmao
It’s only trashy if you are not from an English speaking country
Here in France trashy people often name their kids after their favorite soap opera, as a result American or Americanized names are trashy because when people hear that you are named Brandon and are from French parents they generally assume your parents were white trash
Think about a western weebo giving his child a Japanese name, would be totally fine there but in the west not so much
Exactly !! Every name that end in ey is a france recipe for disaster
Like that one girl in my middle school whose name was kimberley prononced it kim beurrr lééé (that french e sound you know the one)
It was dramatic
Exactly
Kevin is a teen with a cracked voice and Brandon cares a bit too much about motocyrcles and hitting his mom
No theyre just american/english names
The weirdness comes more from the fact that they are old names (both had their peak of popularity before 1960 and are rarely given nowadays), whereas in Germany the'yre given to kids
It's like if you learnt that Heinrich or Margarete were trashy names for children in another country :)
Yes I agree ! Just wanted to point out that it was quite an old name
Jordan ffs
So true
In the case of France it is generally right next to a Johnny Halliday sticker
Oh my bad
I read your comment as "are they native
" As in, are these name native american ? Sorry you meant naive haha
Yes, these names are associated with naive/dumb people in France
Edit : I just saw your edit
Welp sorry for that
What is your Country's Greatest invention
In general, maybe the metric system
In the realm of the military, maybe smokeless powder
Beyond the realm of science I’d say enlightenment and nationalism
[Most of these ]
In the French curriculum  we are thaught that the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg marks the historical start of the Renaissance, so I guess it is indeed a pretty big game changer
Wait, isn't the lightning rod Benjamin Franklin
I would also say the first telecommunications network, that got france a huge advantage during the revolution wars
Also wasn't one of the first vaccine french ?
The self contained breathing apparatus for diving was also invented by a French (first thing that came to my mind, don't know why)
La carte à puce ainsi que les boîtes de conserves sont des inventions françaises
Reinforced concrete, too
It’s used all over the world, and it was a French’s idea & doing
Not sure About that last one being "Great" but the rest pass
De Gaulle invented it, wrote a book about it which inspired Guderian
Problem was that De Gaulle wasn't listened to by those in command of the French army
Yeah, modern vaccines are a french invention
Louis Pasteur for the win
What is considered as the first vaccine is the smallpox one by Edward Jenner, an Englishman I believe
So no
Pasteur wasn't first there, not by a long shot
The name even comes from there, as they used a variant of the disease that infects cows ("variole vaccine" or just "vaccine")
Correct
The Lumière brothers
AND photography
Captain Cousteau invented it
That one might be the greatest
That'd be my pick for Portugal, it was an insane game changer in human history
Where did i say he was french ????
the semaphore line [
Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that you are a dutch, speaking to a french, on reddit, congratulating his (well our) nation, without even complaining about the stupid "they stole our flag" meme
Thank you, I love you
* Esperanto as an administrative lingua franca
* Common tax laws/system for companies
* Convergence of regulations
Plus, that could/would be a big step towards environmental policies
Where can't people do that
Yeah it'd make sense to have an unified rail system on the continent, but I don't see why island nations should comply
why
It's just a matter of taxing alcohol, isn't it
Imagine drinking wine at a party
I mean there's drinking and there's *drinking*.
But
but
that's not possible you can't drink wine like it was vodka
As far as I know there is no other word than collaborator (collaborateur, often shortened to just collabo)
Nowadays I see it mostly used as tech corporate-speak for coworker, which is rather weird to me (the full version
The shortened one is definitely only for nazi collaborators)
My grandparents were teens or younger during the occupation and both them and my parents would only use this word derogatively when I was a child
In France the word "collabo" is still very derogatory, but unfortunately it's now also used by fascists to refer to white people defending minorities
In France, collaborators is an insult, and the gestapo is associated with police harassment
Collabo is still absolutely an insult though
I was thinking "fascho"
Giving away Jews and résistants qualifies as collaboration
Yes
Not the most violent word, but it can really be the harshest of insult even
Well for people over 30 yo anyway
As u/locnlol explained, "collabo" is 100% understood as "a French who was on the Nazis side".
Well calling someone a petainiste would not really be well received generally but it’s not really commonly used as an insult
Pétainiste, but it's not widely used, it's mostly a term used for historical purpose
Absolutely
0 doubt about the meaning of this word
As an example, this word can be heard in Inglourious Basterds in this scene: [
Yes I think calling someone a facho is more common than collabo, but facho is more vague while collabo is really about ww2
I'm going to talk about a classic video game from the 90s:
«Another World» by Eric Chahi
All done by one single person (graphics and programing) on Commodore Amiga hardware and software
Games from Arkane Studios : Dishonored 1 & 2, Prêt
Games from Quantic Dream : Heavy Rain, Beyond: two souls, Detroit: Become Human
Also: rayman legends, Beyond good and evil
Ubisoft is a french company but I can't say what games exactly were developed in France, can someone help plz
Before Another World, he worked on "Future Wars" by Delphine Software, which was a famous point & click adventure game
Infogrammes, créateur de jeux français incroyables
Jokes asides, Valiant hearts: memory of the great war is a very good game about WW1
The Daedalic games are awesome
Another user mentionned the Gothic series, and there is also its successor, the Risen series (a bit of wasted potential this one)
Also, the **Spellforce** games were among my favorites in the early 2000
Hands down the best game I ever played
And I've been gaming since the late 80s.
It's one of the best game of last year, if not the greatest
Ubisoft is French tho
Fun fact : there's absolutely no proof about the « viking funeral » having ever existed among Norse people
The only testimony we know of is about Volga Rus, generations after they've established on the river
There are tons of tombs on land, though
But that's less tabloid-friendly
It was good but season 3 got too confusing
And simultaneously explained obvious things like if we were completely dumb
You'll have a bunch of people, you have no idea how they got there or why, except for one because it's very obvious who he is
and then the only explanation you get is someone mentioning that [very obvious character] is actually [character name]
Like if it was a big reveal
Thanks, but I needed help to understand absolutely everything in that scene, except that
So bad balancing of explanation that made it hard to watch
But great show for the first two seasons
I watched it earlier this year
I liked it in the begining, but the further it went, the worst it gets IMO
Like, not only they took a hard kind of scenario involving time traveling, but they also added more and more until becomming too much for the suspension of credibility IMO
But the musics are so good and the actors are good IMO
I was a bit disappointed by Barbarians
It's still a good watch but ultimately I was left with a feeling that the story was botched and oversimplified, leading to a climax battle who was at best confusing and commonplace
It's especially disappointing when next to that they did an amazing job with sets and props to get the right atmosphere
Belgium : thank you for the humor, the comic strips and the music
Without you, good francophone music would be inexistant nowadays
And thank you for being that neighbor that’s almost like us but much cooler
Spain : thank you for cheap cigs (also applies to Belgium)
Switzerland : thank you for offering high paying jobs near the frontier
And also thanks for the fancy ski stations
Luxembourg : thanks for the tax paradise (also applies to Switzerland)
And for giving a place for young french wolf of Wall Street to train
Germany : thank you for the cars and the autobahn to enjoy said cars
Italy : thank you for offering the second best food and wine in the world
England : thank you for the millennia of wars, alliances, betrayals, joys, hope and blood
Was a fun time having you as our best enemy
EDIT : also a huge thanks to Belgium for the beers
I want to thank Germany for being able to build a strong relationship with us even after a complicated past
And Spain cuz you guys are cool neighbours and I love your country
Thanks luxembourg for the jobs
But not thanks for the racism against french people
Thank you Belgium for the beers, the *bande-dessinées* and the humor
I would like to thanks the German for finally accepting that Alsace-Lorraine is french and stopped waging wars against us to take it back
wasn't Hitler Austrian
You aren’t really ment to be here any more, are you, brits
Nuclear energy is safe tho
And it pollutes very little
The German Coal plants close to Aachen are polluting the air of Belgium much more and are probably responsible for quite a lot of pulmonary disease among Belgians
Our nuclear power plants don't do such things
[Relevant to your last phrase]
"England is my city"
Norwegians go to Sweden for cheap alcohol, Swedish go to Denmark, Danes go to Germany, Germans go to Poland
Poles go to
I'm interested in how
Don't know much about our involvment in the post-WWII decisions
By the way and on topic, I thank Germany for the amazing beer, and the music
Sorry
collateral damage
On les aime, au fond, ces connards de rosbifs <3
I didn't tried to buy Champagne in Sweden but when I was there all alcohols were really expensive
We made some reserve on the ferry from Denmark
Depending where you buy it but Champagne can be pretty cheap in France, maybe not in Paris tho
Or maybe it's because you acted like an ass with us, with your dislike from the start
It sure didn't help
Je suis désolé. I've been too harsh
Breizh Cola, the coke of britanny, you will find it everywhere in France now, pretty popular with Britons diaspora ;)
Par Toutatis !
Bro i was i young but i was really curious what was that beverage 'cuppa' of yours but then i lost all interest when i found out i was just tea but it had to be served in a bloody cup
Available in Alsace too
I (from Lorraine) personnaly find it a quite strange taste
Don't you guys also have Frugo ? I remember drinking some when I was 6 or something and it was the most amazing drink I'v drank

We're not talking about the subtitles but the video titles
It only happens on some videos (I don't know how they're chosen though) so probably a lot of users have never seen it
>title being translated is alien to me
You get it
You can talk about Petain, it’s not super taboo and we don’t mind talking about it
It’s even a common subject for dark humour
We sometimes make jokes about Vichy France but this isn't something we are proud of
Interesting
Can you talk more about the two Spains ? Is it like a culture war between the Francoists/Traditionalists and the secular/leftists ?
Yeah, it's quite common to say that one's grandpa was a *collabo* during the war, just as a joke
There were plenty of fascist movements throughout the world, but the Nazis were really something else, you can't really compare the two
Fascist Italy is more akin to the dictatorships we see today than to Nazi Germany
Does the right still view themselves as the heirs of Franco ?
Some of my older family members still think we did more good than harm by building them infrastructure
Heck, even if the independence movement in Algeria was pretty radical and committed atrocities
They still don't acknowledge that we were very torture happy in Algeria
(edit: And I would argue that as a powerful country and occupant, we probably did way more horrible things that I don't know about)
It moves very slowly here in france when it comes to our history of being a major colonial power AND considering the *free government* (Petin so after we surrendered, not De Gaulle in London) not France
We basically helped the Nazis with their extermination of jews and we barely talked about it during history class
Depends on the game, usually english but if I'm playing a complex game (like grand strategy games etc) for the first time I'd rather have french and switch to english later
It depends
Sometimes I pick the language depending on the quality of the voice acting and translation, sometimes I just choose the language I think fits better the mood of a game
It's a bit of a mess really
I've played Mass Effect in French, Kingdom Come in English, the Witcher in Polish
It depends
Most games are better in English but for instance, I prefer The Last of Us and Bloodborne in french
it depends, i usually tests both but we have great French versioning so i usually keep the French version
In my language
Because I am playing Katawa shojo and it is nice to me to be able to understand what's happening as much as possible and the translation is good
But if I have to play a game with voices in it I think I would prefer to let the voice in the original version and the subtitles in my language or english if my language is not available
I prefer playing in English if it's the original language or if the English translations are better quality which is most often the case
I like puzzle games and got stuck countless times due to having crucial hints badly translated
I don't remember a specific example since I've switched to English years ago
It's so much easier to play
English, because video game localization is literally my job
AMA
On occasion, I'll play in French to see what's being done right now in the field, but too often it'll detract me because I'll pay more attention to the localization and try to guess what the original text was, instead of just playing the game
Besides that, I know the industry and it's exceedingly rare to find a translation that it better than the original
It can happen, but rarely over an entire game
And I prefer to see what the writers intended instead, since I can understand it
Always in french, unless it's a multiplayer game like League of Legends where you might need to used the same terms as everyone to communicate
French if available and it's almost always the case
I don't see the difference honestly, it's professional voice actors in both case
Few games have a broken translation so English for those
Well it depends of how good the dub is in French
These late years they have become much better and the dubbing of video games got  professional
The Witcher 3  is a good example of a perfect French dub
Dare I say that Geralt's voice is much better in French than English
French most of the time
Translating characters’ voices, names of places, objects, etc
don’t denature a game in my opinion
(It certainly does denature a movie however)
honestly out of every game i’ve played, i’ve only been disappointed by the versioning twice, and in France we have a lot of great voice actors
I used to think that too, and when the first Mass Effect came out on pc I played it in french and replayed a second time in english
Since then I play every games in english
The countryside represents a huge territory in France, but it really depends from where you're from
There are very urbanized regions like Île-de-France, Alsace or Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur (mainly the South) and very rural ones like Limousin, Guiana, Centre or Lorraine etc
I'd say that people from the countryside and from most cities kinda hate Paris, that's a point that we all have in common
And Parisians are often seen as assholes that are never happy and that shit on the countryside, but they don't have 200m^2 houses with gardens, they don't know their postman nor almost everyone in their city, they don't have deserted roads without any traffic jam, and they produce 0% of the French agriculture so they might be jealous towards us, but that's all I think
Most rurals like where they live and are proud of this, including me
There's no such big conflict between rural and non rural in my country
France has one of the most populated and "developed" countryside in Europe and I think this is the reason why
The only thing would maybe be that rural people see non rural as very non-manual (they need to hire and pay someone to repair or change the smallest thing in their house)
And also Parisians being jerks but Paris is a very different topic
Yes, it's more "Paris vs
The rest of France" than "cities vs
countryside".
Cities aren't rural areas
Confusing "la province" with the countryside is exactly what Parisians do
Pas besoin d'habiter dans la cambrousse pour maudire les pourritures parisiennes
True
I don't think there's an actual rural / non rural fight since most of the population lives in the countryside
It's mostly about Paris / vs the rest
Do you think Lyon, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nice, Nantes, etc
are "the countryside" or "rural"? Paris isn't the only city in the country
Un allié !
AFAIK a very large majority of the French population is urban
Et vous trouvez ça normal de parler des gens comme ça en plus
Bande de cons
You're right, I didn't mean in term of numbers
What I mean that France has a certain part of it's population living in small villages
In fact, there are more villages in our country than any other country has in Europe
But still, more people are urban of course
C'est pas moi qui suis en train de traiter les gens de bande de cons il me semble
Yes
I’m ashamed of my poor German (and someday I’d like to go back to learning Russian)
It depends more on your hobbies, in my hobbies I come across a lot of japanese and sometimes spanish so that makes me want to learn these languages
On my way to learn japanese and fuck it's hard
Good luck, you’re entering a beautiful nonsense place
I don't think it's not "enough" because I don't need to speak more languages, but I'm a bit ashamed I only speak 1 foreign language properly (english)
I learnt spanish and Mandarin at school but can't remember much
I would love, just for pleasure, to learn Turkish and Russian, 2 languages I love the sound, especially the first one, plus I love their culture
And maybe Arabic and Korean too
I live in France and can speak almost all neighboring languages : english, italian and spanish, so I guess I'll feel more complete when I'll learn german
>but once you know kana and ~150 kanji it gets way better
I already noticed that a bit, only started like 4 months ago but with something like 70-80 kanjis in my mind I can already notice patterns, same kanjis repeating all the time just combined with other ones to make different meanings etc, it already got a bit easier, it's just a lot of information to process
But I know I have a long way to go, can't wait to be comfortable enough with japanese in general so that I don't need to try and "decompose" every sentence I see to make out where a word starts and where it ends
I can assure you it is
C’est peut-être le fait d’en parler déjà une, ce qui rend les autres assez similaires
Mais je sous-entendais surtout atteindre le niveau de langue où les seules erreurs que l’on fait sont involontaires
Absolutely not
We would need snow in the first place
This is the first time I've ever seen that in my life
But I live in Southern France so it's not really surprising lol
It's now or never, try it
Il neige chez moi
Very few places in (metropolitan) France where it *never* snows though
Thank you, I was actually going to ask how it was made
Temps are starting to freeze here and will for about a month, I have to try this
Where I am from (Marseille) we may have one day of snow every 5 years or so, and it usually melts the very same day
But you can't generalise that to the whole country
AZF factory near Toulouse, chemical factory, 300t of ammonium nitrate exploded in 2001
31 deaths, 2500 wounded
My great-grandmother was Ukrainian
Well no comment
AZF is the most recent comparison, but there is actually a much closer one, the Ocean Liberty (as in liberty ship) explosion that occured in the Brest harbour in 1947
That was over 3000t of ammonium nitrate
I think AZF was closer to the city center than Beirut's harbour was fortunately
One of the things I am the most ashamed of
Italy: we love you unconditionally, even if some of you insist that we are terrible
We will just love you even more for it
Just like a grumpy cat
Germany: glad you are our new best pals for the foreseeable future, hopefully it will remain this way if one day Merkel gives her office to someone else
It sure beats bayoneting each other by the millions every twenty years or so
England: sorry you were not on board for the EU project as much as we were
Brexit just sounds a bit like a bad breakup and I hate people who say « I hope we can stay friends » but I do hope we can stay friends
Scotland: sucks you got taken in for the Brexit ride, you guys are awesome and I love that you guys still remember The Auld Alliance while so many of us (but not all) forgot it
Belgium: I love you crazy fuckers, you are like a crazy scientist’s experiment that somehow functions but no one has a clue why
Hands down the best beer in the world too, there is just no competition because they all went to sleep after two Chimays
The Red Devils are always my backup team in big competitions even if I know Les Bleus would never be yours, even if they somehow found a way to cure cancer
Romania: I don’t know why but I always root for you and wish you the best
Sorry for the ignorant people who think you are all living in caravans and stealing copper wiring off building sites, they are stupid people who never left their city
Romanian people I met always were cool as hell
Poland and Czechoslovakia: sorry for the WW2 unpleasantness
Our government of the time was dealing with its own shit and had a mix of incompetent and cowardly people at the helm
As Churchill said to Chamberlain after the Munich agreements: « You had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose dishonor and you will get war ».
Dear Belgium,
We love you
You're actually better than us, and deep down we acknowledge it
I wish we cut out the stupid accent imitation which is so rude and uncalled for
I hope that slowly we're getting there
Thank you for the comic books, the chocolates, and the enlighting concept of going on without a gouvernement
Dear Scotland and Ireland,
We would be able to understand you
Please don't dumb down your accent to plain English
Your accent is super cool
We're just not that good in English so oftentimes we're don't know how something is called in English rather than being troubled by your accents
Maybe speak a bit slowly if you feel that you've lost us
Don't give up on us
We can do it
Dear Netherlands,
Sorry for calling you Holland
We're working on it, I swear
I'm sad that History somehow stucked us appart, because I feel than we have more in common than we think
Dear Germany,
I'm always amazed how far you travel
I've been to remote place of the world and I've always met German people there
You know a lot and keep learning humbly
I always learned a lot of things from you guys and loved our philosophical political talks and imaging a better world
You set some good examples to us to follow and we're glad we're over that batshit crazy feud we had
I'm proud of us two, how we managed to u-turn from hissing at each other to complete respect and friendship
Dear Spain,
Thank you for living slow
Yes, really
I feel like we should slow down too
Dear everyone,
Contrary to popular belief, we do not think we're better than other people
We're not that competitive and cultures can't be ranked to begin with
We've been at the highest high and the lowest low in the course of our history and right now we're just trying to carry on with our shit
I love Italy and Italians but unfortunately, I can't really be there at the moment
Auld alliance for ever mate
No offense taken little England
Dear Netherlands,
Thank you for setting the gold standard for bike infrastructure in modern urbanism,  You basically made biking cool again
Also the deltawerken made me proud to be european
Finally I have not idea why you like camping so much, but it's always nice to speak with y'all when you're in south France
Indeed for Italy, we love you unconditionally !
I was about to add "Dear Italy, everything is pardoned for 2006; eventhough it took 12 years and you not qualifying to play a world cup
I'm almost sorry it took so long
I guess we sometimes know how to hold a grudge
I would say we only have a real "mutual rivalry" with the UK
I almost never hear French people say negative things about Italy, Spain or Portugal
As far as Germany is concerned, my teachers have always insisted on the "special franco-german friendship" and I've always had respect for german people however I know it's not the case for every French people
Also yes, I agree, the surrender jokes aren't funny
It's not hurtful, it's just unoriginal and boring
Every time people (especially American people) make a surrender joke, I cringe
I live quite close to the border between Italy and France and I don't think I've ever heard French people "hating" on Italy
Except maybe for football matches, (but I think that actually a lot of French football supporters love to watch the Italian championship) and a little bit of critics of your politicians (don't worry, ours are as bad as yours lol) and food
Teasing England ? Hell yeah
Teasing Belgium ? Hell yeah
Germany ? A little bit
Spain and Italy ? No, not really
It's definitiveky not seen as "mutual rivalry" here
In fact I think French people love both Italy and Spain, mainly for the weather, cheaper items, holidays and good food lol
So it's a one-sided love then ? :( Lmao
>France: give back Lorraine
You can't eat a quiche and have it
Thanks u/joelherman the thread is so interesting
We used our quota for you already
The dutch, danes and norwegians too
Germany contractually can't. Spain wouldn't like the weather
I dunno try Poland ?
Damn you made me crave for a nice Gewurtzaminer
You are, we will love you like a grumpy cat that insists he does not love you back
French people expecting Belgian people to cheer for Les Bleus are not sane or they never went to Belgium
I grew up in Picardy so I had lots of occasions to visit and I am realistic about what to expect
If you ask the average French person about Italy, the first thing they will say is that it's a beautiful country, that the food is fantastic and that they would love to go there
Now, if you ask them to compare Italy with France, then yes, some may say things like "France has more varied landscapes" but you can hardly consider this as "hating on Italy".
Also keep in mind that French redditors are not representative of the general French population
Never heard the French have much beef with other latin countries in general though, let alone Italy in particular
It's genuinely the first time I hear this and those points that french people apparently made make no sense to me
I'm really sorry you've met French people who talked badly about Italy
Aside from the 2006 final issue among hot-headed soccer fans (who are a minority) who have since moved on, I haven't met anyone who would diss Italy
>Also france has still some debts with us so some resentment is right (not to the single people, but conceptually
Debt for which of our many wrong deeds
Thanks man
Appreciate it
We get salty about it because the 20yo soldiers to be in '39 would have had to be born during WWI and that couldn't have happened
We also provided planned parenthood tools, so that the poor could get out of poverty trap and got unfairly punished for that social choice while Germany pushed for bigger families
And we were just outnumbered in WWII, there were no way it would be enough
half of the country
let's not exaggerate, it is estimated that about 5% of the population was actively involved in the war, either resisting or collaborating .
This does not take away from the fact that the jokes about surrender are stupid
> but often french redditors say “i love italy but it’s only pasta and pizza, you have less coastline mountain sea or whatever than us, you are less varied than us”
You seem real salty about that, wanna talk about it
It's only the 3rd time you're saying it in this thread :')
I mean, French romanticism right
Tbf, I never saw an Italian complain about the joke before, while whenever you have a surrender joke, you have a french guy who'll say it's lame
I'm probably biased but I think that in terms of landscapes and climate, France is extremely diverse
I don't know why you call  plainland monotone
Some of the most beautiful French regions are plainland (imo)
jeuxvideo
com is widely known as a cesspool, do yourself a favor and don't go there
It's like a French 4chan without the NSFW pictures
Never saw hate toward italians on French youtube
It probably exists because there are always retards but I never saw it and it is not a common sentiment that I can observe in real life among the population
if there is one thing I see myself not drinking it is milk (and pastis but that is for another time), I really don't like the taste at all
But I love anything made out of milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt
Not me at least
I strongky dislike milk, I use soy or hazelnut milk instead
Disgusting
I drink milk everyday, but I don't like it raw, only with cereals OR chocolate; but the best milk is when it have transformed into cheese <3
You've only tried UHT milk, right ? For a very long time I found milk nasty
Even with chocolate, I hated it
After trying fresh milk from a local farm, I found out I actually hate UHT taste
Try whole microfiltered milk if you haven't. It tastes sweet, nothing like burnt cheese UHT
Regular liquid milk that's been sterilized : disgusting
Raw milk that got solid because of the bacterias and molds in it : absolutely delicious !
I'm exagerating but that's how i feel about it
I don't really like the taste of liquid milk but I'll eat the strongest and smelliest cheese with great pleasure
Absolutely hate drinking milk
Ahh cool noice !
Well at least in france I have some Cheese bars ! :)
I'm from the country land and yeah I've tasted it but I don't have a lot of memmories about it as it was maybe 15 years ago but I'll try maybe someday
Are you my greek alter ego
See me on r/eatingcheesetwiceaday
I've always heard "à Tataouïne". For a long time I thought Tataouïne doesn't exist but it's actually a city in Tunisia
Trifouilly-les-Oies is a (fictional) caricatural, random and boring rural french village lost in the middle of nowhere
We also often use Bab-el-Oued, a district of Algiers, to designate something very far away location
Triffouillis-les-Oies or Perpète-les-Oies, Pétaouchnok,   Au diable Vauvert (old school), Bab-el-Oued (north african)
Vauvert (Gard) and Bab-el-Oued (Algeria) are actual places
« À pétaouchnok » a fictional city approximately located in Russia for somewhere very far away
« Perpète-lès-oies » for a village in the middle of nowhere
Tombouctou, and we have another one which was made up to sound vaguely Russian: "Pétaouchnok"
Some imaginary, very remote Russian or Ukrainian village called «Petaouchnok». The expression dates back to the mid-19th century, around the time of the Crimean war
we say that in french too
it's "au cul du monde" (more like butt of the world, but the feel is similar)
Il y a aussi le trou du cul du monde non ?
"Perpette-les-olivettes" ou "Perpette-les-oies" sont plus courants en Provence, et "chaille" en Rhônes-Alpes
Sinon il y a aussi "Pétaouchnok", je sais pas si c'est local
Bab El Oued also exists in French
I always heard "le trou du cul du monde" -the ass of the world
>where dogs bark with their asses
By far my favourite
Pas faux mais moins utilisé quand même
Chaille
où plus précisément, car je suis de Rhone Alpes et jamais entedu
On dit aussi (Lyon) Perpette les oies mais pas les olivettes  et on dit aussi Pétaouchnok
En effet on entend perpette et perpette-les-oies par contre chaille j'ai vraiment jamais entendu
J'ai grandi dans l'Ain et je suis à Lyon
Petaouchnok et Perpette-les-oies sont assez courants chez moi en Gironde
J'ai déjà entendu aussi le beau combo entre Perpette-les-oies et Tatatouine : Tataouine-les-oies
Tataouine-les-bains aussi
Because Star Wars is rather recent
Fun fact: the scenes of Tatooine were shot in Tunisia
Jamais entendu à Tataouine
Trou du cul du monde très souvent par contre
Je viens aussi de Rhône-Alpes et je confirme qu'on dit bien "à chaïlle" voir même "à chaïlle les oies". Viens de Valence, je sais pas où c'est dit d'autre en Rhône-Alpes
Ça fait partie du vocabulaire de mes cousins ardéchois et mon de chéri isérois
C'est peut-être juste le "Sud Rhône-Alpes" alors (Ardèche, Drôme et Isère)
Oui j'ai remarqué que c'est très régional y'a pas mal de truc que j'avais vraiment jamais entendu de ma vie
Ca doit être un truc du sud de la région, comme "ça pegue", une amie ardéchoise le disait nous jamais
It's rough and it gets everywhere
Wait I just noticed this
Anakin is from Tatooine right ? How the fuck does he hates sand ? It would be like an Inuit hating snow
Ça pegue c'est même encore bien plus au sud je crois ! On l'utilise dans ma famille mais je crois que même pour la Drôme c'est rare
> Basically it's now forbidden to leave the country
Most governments have a law that allows to shut down the borders in some situations like this one so I suppose it is
I do blame them, countless government bodies telling people not to hoard stuff, that it's not necessary and that it will ultimately hurt the system and medical professionals
They're acting selfish, no one needs 56 rolls of toilet paper - are they planning on having diarrhea for 3 weeks straight ?
I think the difference was in expectactions
France was considered the main country able to oppose Germany with UK
I don't doubt Denmark implication or professionalism but if you compare their numbers and economy with Germany's at the start of the war, no one would have really bet on you from the get go
People had a lot of hope for France to be able to at least severely damage Germany and we let everyone down and that's the actual reason why we get that much flack
You guys have a wide variety of cheese
However, the brits have their share of great local cheese
Sì, ma non fa lo sguardo assassino al turista se lui o lei dimentichi la parola magica
E quindi, inizia la leggenda
Please, we are talking seriously here
Don't kinkshame us like that
\*blushes\* not here Portugal, there is too many people

Where is England ?\*sweats nervously\*
There are business district but just not in the historic center
I think you can't build higher than the Eiffel Tower in France
In Lyon a lot of skyscrapers are under construction and were planned for the 2020 decade but we elected a ecologist mayor and he wants to cancel all those projects
It leaves only Paris and La Défense building skyscrapers
Most of cities have instaured laws against building skyscrapers to preserve the landscape, the originality and authencity of the cities since some have over 1000 years old buildings
Hence most of skyscrapers are located out of the city (such as Paris as you mentioned)
NB : several cities have a construction height limit based on the height of the main cathedral (such as Strasbourg where the cathedral is and will stay the highest building)
By the way, don't you think that with telecommuting being more widespread because of Covid, that kind of buildings would be less and less necessary
There are 2 now in Marseille (the [CMA-CGM tower] and the [La Marseillaise tower] and many are stiil against them but at least they are not generic buildings
Still, the previous majority (right) on the city council wanted to create a whole lot of them, to create a sort of business district
The new majority (left) will most probably halt that for a while
"Prêt ou pas, me voilà!"
Nous aussi mais uniquement quand on joue à cache cache
J'avais compris de manière générale
Makes me smile when hearing people from Québec or the Antilles
The advantage of French is that it's pretty standardized so there is little differences between countries
There is the accent though which can take (a very short) time to adapt to, with far away countries (in America, in Africa)
However some french speaking region can have other dialects based on french but other than french, like joual in Quebec or creole in the isles and it would be hard to directly understand all of it
I personnaly love the different accents and vocabulary  from other countries
By using different words and idioms, you can figure out that people think differently and add more importance to statements/ are more sensible to an aspect of their culture
For example the Quebecois (French canada) use religious words for swearing because their relation to the church is completely different from France
Another example is that in South east Asia, elder people (the last ones to speak French unfortunately) are always talking about  animals  when it comes to describe something ("he ran as fast as a horse", "you need need the strength of a cow to move this barrel", "these players are coordinated as a wolves group" etc etc)
Please keep talking with your own words
It is always refreshing and sharing cultures and ideas is thus easier and more interesting
Diversity is the key
Québécois has a little charm
I don't mind if people were to use it, it's just that nobody would understand
Same apply to every other, I don't see why people wouldn't like other people using a different vocabulary
> I feel like they differences with Australia/NZ etc are pretty minimal IMO
Really ? I have no problem understanding brits but I once spoke with an aussie and didn't understand half of what he was saying
It was probably a question of accent rather than vocabulary though
Australians use primarily American English, at least in Western Australia (where I live)
Apartment, truck, etc
Oh, they do use chips for both chips and crisps, so they are a bit confused sometimes
I honestly understand almost nothing about what happens in Germany but I'm glad we're finally friends
Why did Brazil build an entire new capital city in the middle of nowhere ??
We're not vocal when we're happy, Macron as still 25% of the population with him
And the president is saw as the symbol of the state and the governement so every mistakes or bad decision is put on him
It really does define who we are
Who was it that said "The French are people who live in heaven but think they are in hell" or something like that
Being unsatisfied with how things are can be healthy if it drives you to betterment
We overdo it though
Would say our neighbors underdo it too
I'm French and I can't stand the complaining either
No, but I’d be interested in learning about it
Willing to share
Please
In France it's a legal obligation to dub a movie on television
Englishmen after the SF: ["it was all irony
Nobody in the country ever believed we could do it"]
Seems like something that could have been a good idea but was not
Interesting, though, thanks for sharing
For example: Tippex, Nutella, Sopalin (paper towels, actually it's *SO*ciété de *PA*pier *LIN*ge, which translates to company of paper towels), frigo and stuff
I don't know a lot of them in french, but I'm sure that we've got "Sopalin" from the brand, Sopalin, it's the paper towels
Edit: We've got alos the Tipp-ex but it can be called "Blanco" and the Post-it
Ah good old Tippex !
We use it too
Y'a aussi Scotch (tape)
Abribus too
It's a JCDecaux brand
It's actually called an aubette
There's also Tupperware for the plastic boxes
I've also commonly heard Mir or Paic to refer to any brand of dish soap
IL y a aussi "Un caddie" qui est une marque de chariot, et pas un chariot en lui même
J'ai appris dans ce thread via d'autre gens que Jaccuzi est une marque et pas le nom d'un SPA
Aja ça merci
Yes it should be company
Yes sorry got confused with the word
Yeah that's a trick, because in french company is "société"
In French, a kite is called a "cerf-volant" which can be translated to a "flying deer". It came from the word "serp-volante" where "serpe" is the old word for snake
As the word "serpe" disappeared, it became "cerf" because it sounds similar
The word for dragon is dragon
Nope
Kite = cerf-volant (flying deer)
Dragon = dragon
It is "serpent" which indeed comes from "serpens"
In Spain, a US citizen talking to a clerk in French, who wouldn't understand anything of course
When I asked her why she would do that, she told me that since Spanish and French were latin languages, he should be able to understand
Take photos in front of a gravestone
Tourists crossing the Place de l’Etoile in Paris (the road that circles the Arc de Triomphe)
I know that we, as French, are not known to be the most keen on using crossings, but dude, when you see a whole bunch of cars trying to make their way around this huge monument, you just don’t cross
Seems basic, but I see tourists do the opposite on a daily basis
I've been to Auschwitz this year and I've seen so many people taking selfies in front of the *Arbeit macht frei* gate, it genuinely shocked me
That's in the Invalides right
Cool museums there
Ah, you made an honest mistake though, don't sweat it
Difficult not to do so in some cemeteries
Take Recoleta in Buenos Aires or the Père Lachaise in Paris
Those have very photogenic gravestones
Maybe he was gathering some textures to add them later in a 3D environment, for video game/architectural/advertising purposes
But it's quite specific
I'm sure it was under a shared agreement with your interlocutor
I understand Italian well enough, but if someone started to randomly talk to me in Italian outside of Italy without notice I would be very confused
As was this Spanish clerk being spoken to in French in his own country
I speak 3 but if you start to speak to me in italian, I will look at you madly confused and not understand you
They never tried English while I was here, so we will never know
When it’s a recent gravestone
I mean people are still suffering from their loss they do not need dumb people taking photos of such an intimate place, even it’s in the Père Lachaise
I find it gross, and disrespectful
I live in a small village where an ex celebrity (Gregory Lemarchal) is buried
His parents lives in my village, goes to his grave but are constantly disturbed by fans taking photos of their DECEASED son’s gravestone
You wanna grieve ? Do it decently
Mourn him if you want but don’t take ekcing photos
I think it's spelled geyser in English, the I and capital G would indicate that it's about the specific site in Iceland :)
Yes, it's call "la province" and it sound  a bit derogatory, so now the PC term is "les territoires". People of Paris have the stereotype of being smug asshole that look at the rest of the country with despising eyes
even Lyon and Marseilles (around 2 000 000 hab in the metro area) is part of the province
Every time a Parisian uses the word "province" a rat gives birth in Paris
I would also mention the [*diagonale du vide*] (diagonal of emptiness), which refers to the low-density population stretching from the Landes in the southwest to the Meuse in the northeast
it's generally count as Paris
I once went to Paris (I'm from Lyon), the guy at the hotel yeld "which room for to provinciaux
" to his collegue, provinciaux was said in a very  contemptuous way
Most of them thinks we all live in a hunt without wifi or even a museum around\^\^
To Parisians, it's the "banlieue" or even "provinciaux" (I live in Seine-et-Marne, which is mostly fields and forests outside of the urbanized areas), to the rest of France, they are Parisians
As someone who lives there, it's annoying
I certainly don't consider myself Parisian
Paris and its close suburbs are very much different from here in the way you live and the way it looks, no matter how close it is
Parisians look down on us as the dirty "banlieusards" who come pollute Paris with cars and sully their perfect clean city, and when I go in vacation elsewhere in France, I get called Parisian
Getting smugged by everyone be fun
No it counts as "la banlieue" (the suburbs)
A different category in itself
I can confirm that people live here
Oui alors, quand même pas hein, et heureusement !
_We do not actually think that, which is good because it would be an awful cliché to believe in_
Ouais enfin t'es surtout tombé sur un bon connard hein, il ne faut pas oublier qu'une bonne partie des gens habitants en IDF sont d'anciens provinciaux, donc pas du genre à juger ceux qui y habitent encore
"Adieu tous ces gens prétentieux dans la capitale
Qu'essaient de prouver qu'ils valent mieux que toi chaque fois qu'ils te parlent
Tous ces connards dans la pub, dans la finance
Dans la com', dans la télé, dans la musique, dans la mode
Ces parisiens, jamais content, médisants
Faussement cultivés, à peine intelligent
Ces répliquants qui pensent avoir le monopole du bon goût
Qui regardent la province d'un œil méprisant "Orelsan - suicide social
J’adore parce qu’à côté le type habite à Paris et _franchement_ il y a peu de comportements plus parisiens que de dire qu’on ne l’est pas
Oui il a grandi ailleurs (Caen je crois ?) mais enfin, c’est aussi le cas de plein de monde dans cette ville

When I was still a little kid I went to Québec and was surprised to find French speakers outside of France, outside of Europe
First I went to London when I was a child, I remember that me and my family went to a McDonald's and the cashier started speaking to us in French
That's when I learnt about the amount of French people in London
I’m sorry you had to hear this
I can’t imagine talking in such a mean way of anyone whether they understand me or not
Why wouldn’t you simply says « when that woman moves ». Some people are just rotten
Why'd you get punished to give your opinion on something
Isn't it what school was made for, to develop a critical mind in order to differentiate what you like/agree with from what you don't?
Yeah but it's not even a language thing
I would never think to design someone as 'the fat old chick'. Maybe at worst "the one with the weird hair", or the big teeth, or any distinctive feature like this; but idk, I'd feel like an asshole even just saying what he said you know
Like I feel like my friends would (rightfully) judge me if I said it to them
You just encountered the meanest German tourists in Indonesia
Ah thanks for the correction
And I'm glad you enjoyed Malaysia :)
I think you are too nice to defend them
They were rude, it is not the end of the world, but still
But that you defend them still shows that you have the better character
As a French girl studying in London, I would always stand out from British girls when going out at night because I was the only one whose belly button was not showing
People in uni dress a lot more casually than in my high school
Nobody is dressing like us
It's subjective but I feel like we're putting more attention on what we wear than other europeans
Actually, German people wear more camping clothes all the time (we used to joke about Jack Wolfskin being the most popular cloth shop in Germany) and are less formal in the office than in France
I won't say there's a huge difference, maybe more for women
Although German people do dress up for important occasion, and we (I used to work in Germany) were often surprised by Dutch in conferences that would still wear jeans, sometimes a t-shirt and no jacket or ties
We do but it's not very hard to be honest
Nobody will look weirdly at you because of what you're wearing, except in Paris or if you're wearing really strange clothes
Remember : I can go to another country, buy a house, get a job and have free health care
My wife has been in France for over a decade as a German citizen
No questions asked
None
My brother, a French guy, lived in Belgium but went to the university in the Netherlands
He crossed the border every morning and every night, probably had an ID with him
I don’t even think so, he just crossed a bridge and there were no customs or anything
He did have his ID with him when he came back home (to France) because he’d take the Thalys then and, you know, terrorists attacks
I did the same when I came to see him, but it never got checked -guess I was lucky
Also, in terms of school trips, through the years I went to: Italy (twice), England, Belgium, Luxembourg and I _think_ the Netherlands
In terms of friends & family trips, much more than that (Italy, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands
No need for passport inside Schengen area (UE+Switzerland+Norway+Island)
For people living not far from a border it
is extremely casual
People living in north of France casually for buy their smokes in Belgium or Andorra because it’s less expensive
Depends how far from the border you live
I know people who go to Spain or Germany monthly to buy booze and cigarettes because the prices in France are ridiculous, but they live less than 50km away
Otherwise it would be quite useless and a waste of gas
I haven't been outside the country in a decade
My grand parent often go to belgium (we live in northern France) , like that , because some stuff are less expensive
Going back in france from uruguay via a stop in madrid was the best feeling ever when the queue for EU citizens was empty and I passed the checks instantely in front of angry uruguayans who were waiting at the foreigner's queue
People go to Germany shopping, lots of stuff is cheaper there
I lived close to a border for some time
At least 3 times a month I went to a neighboring country
Some of my friends/acquaintances commuted daily to a neighboring country
I usually go to Belgium once a week for tobacco
My wife's niece's boyfriend works in Belgium, and goes there just about every day
Same with the Lille metropolis
People living in the North go to Andorra
For a Best Of Big Mac
I live in Tourcoing and used to go to Belgium like every week, mostly to buy cheaper cigarettes
Also my tattoo artist is in Belgium
On the other hands, many belgians come to France to do their groceries
Yes, the passport makes it a lot easier to be recognized as a citizen of aforementioned country (official document) in another country
Every time I've showed an official document which was not a passport it made things more difficult however legal and legit it was : when I showed my official French ID card IN California they had never seen one, when I showed my California driver's license in France they weren't sure what to do with it
The rules vary from country to country e.g. in France not many people know a driver's license is technically not a valid ID
Cultures vary within countires too - Switzerland is actually a great example
Not from Paris, but even as Frenchman, I can say that fuck driving anywhere in Paris or on the "Périphérique" if you're new to the city
I avoid driving there like the plague
I don't drive, but l'Etoile (which is what it's called) is notorious for being super scary for most people
It's kind of a test, like if you can cross it feeling safe, you have truly become a Parisian driver
Whether or not that's a good thing I'm not sure
Parisian here ! I can manage most of our traffic, Périphérique included, but I still avoid Etoile (where the Arc de Triomphe is) and Nation (its sister roundabout in a less touristy part)
I actually go around it through the side streets
Paris isn't the worst - I've been to Clermont-Ferrand on holidays last summer and the people would go all-out on narrow winding mountains roads ! And let's all agree to forget Corsica even exists :)
Not really, because I drive there every morning on a motorbike
The rule is to let people entering the square from the right (the avenues) when they have the green light
One gets used to it fairly quickly
Even bikes find their way through
The problem are the tourists who, for some reason, didn't realise there is a tunnel to get to the Arc
They walk their way to the center, which is extremely dangerous and very scary because vehciles drive fast when there's no traffic
I almost hit some teenagers once, they were running through the cars
Parisians have developped the unique ability not to give any fuck when it comes to driving
I, on the other hand, would rather take the train and pay more than to drive in Paris
Not a Parisian but I think the unspoken rule of driving in Paris is that you warn people of what you are going to do and then you just do it and it is the responsibility of the guy behind you to make sure they don’t collide with you
You only deal with what is in front of you basically
It just takes assertiveness basically
If you hesitate you are going to have a bad time
It's a rite of passage
Fuck driving a car in Paris, as far I'm concerned
As a Parisian, I just don't drive, and most of the ones I know (meaning born and having always lived in Paris or in the close suburbs) usually don't get a licence before they are around 30 or even older
But yeah, the Arc de Triomphe is one of my worst driving nightmare (along with the corsican roads, as an other redditor pointed out
When driving on the Place de l’Etoile (the Arc de Triumph roundabout’s name), just picture yourself as a fish in a bench
Go with the flow and avoid people around you
It’s actually fairly easy when you act chill about it
Not really
I do it quite often on my bicycle, it isn't so scarry
Cars tend  to mind each other, so they drive slowly
There are some places more dangerous like the peripherique, (higway around paris), Nation, pote-Maillot
I don't drive, but going through the place de l'étoile on my bike is something I was glad to do exactly once and never again after that
As a French that lived near Paris for a long time, I can say that it takes two hours to go from Paris to Paris
So it is hell
Of course not, it's just a roundabout
Except when there's people on it, then yes, it's like a huge game of chicken
You have to be more alert than usual, with a rather calm temperament
A tips is to not take general annoyance personally
Parisian here, the trick is to only look forward and respect the right of way to those entering the circle
after that its all good !
Place de la Concorde is up there too
Yes, it is
I believe it would actually be illegal
By the way, I've heard the same claim about Italian insurances not covering Naples in their basic plans, is that also a myth ?
Yes it's a myth, can't be uninsured when driving anywhere, especially somewhere as accidents-prone as l'Etoile
In case of an incident on l'Etoile the fault is very often shared 50/50 as it is almost impossible to determine who did wrong, except if it's clear someone denied priority, the Etoile being about the only roundabout in France where people entering the roundabout have priority
It's a myth, but I just found an [article] with more info
Responsibility is shared 50/50 if both people were respecting the priorities of the intersection, otherwise they try to find who is at fault like with any incident
However I did learn that student drivers aren't allowed on it
Yes
Having a small scratched car is the best strategy in Paris imho, "I won't mind another scratch, would you
" works very well
Fucking hell these guys are absolutely insane, crossing this shit like it's India or something
Do they believe you gotta deserve your visit of the Arc by crossing the death trap first, that everyone did it that way ?
I can see that you didn't get the memo, German tanks are not allowed in Paris anymore
Marseille is next level shit on so many aspects
Yes la Concorde is hard, Porte Maillot too, crossing the Pont d'Iena (between Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower) as well, and I may forget a few
People who don't have kids like to drive motor bikes or scooters for a reason
There's nothing quite like being stuck behind a tractor in Corsica
No, not the only one
Any roundabout without the blue round "left priority" sign is a "right priority" crossroad, for a roundabout it means that people entering have priority
Most roundabouts have the blue sign but not all, especially in small towns
Please, remember that, or don't drive in my neighborhood
> the Etoile being the only roundabout in France were people entering the roundabout have priority
They are rare but it's not the only one no
I must admit the signs for the tunnel could be more visible, especially if you're not in Champs Elysées
But, yes, it's pretty obvious one shouldn't walk there
Oops translated directly from French without thinking
I meant a fish in a shoal
I'll just drive straight across the roundabout like I always do but thanks for the advice
I agree, yet more scratches means you're a veteran of some ugly battles
If you're attempting to cross this there are 3 options : traffic in your country is that insane that it seems normal to you, you're suicidal or you're an idiot
No really, that was a symbolic gesture, an only once in a lifetime thing, now keep YOUR tanks on YOUR side of the Maginot lines
>Any optimism that it might improve in future
Minus the bankrupt part in your case
Fougace
Doesn't matter, they'll avoid you all the same
Yet seeing yourself as a veteran duelist put you in the right mood for driving in Paris, feeling like a shitty driver doesn't
You can be the best driver and have other ppl dink your car while you are parked, it happens so much here
Yep, that's my excuse too
We have many loan-words from english like' week-end' for example
But the most surprising are usually the ones we took from german
We have integrated the word "Ersatz" which means substitute, to use with food items in sentences like 'un ersatz de café' (a subsitute for coffee)
This one probably comes from WW2 times, when Germany was occupying France and took the good ingredients (coffee, potatoes, etc
) for their troops while french ppl got the subsitutes (chicory, jerusalem artichoke, etc
Another anecdote i like to tell about loan words is the one from "to flirt". We integrated it in modern french language as flirter, but the english verb itself is a loan word ! It originates from the very outdated french expression 'conter fleurette' (literaly telling little flowers, means to seduce, or at least to try ! XD)
> ersatz
I never heard this word until now, I guess it's used in the North East near Germany
Bra is "soutien-gorge" in French, literally "Breast-support"; *gorge* means throat nowadays, but was used for breasts as well until the interwar period
As far as I know, italian words ending with a consonant are extremely rare
from what i found (quick search on wiktionary) 'conter fleurette' comes back from at least XVI century, and the use of 'flirt' in french was already existent around 1880
but eeh i aint no linguist so idk what's true or not now
Intuitively i read media the latin way so i had no idea what you were saying xD
no, it's used everywhere
I guess the occasions to use it are just rarer now
In France, the second most spoken language is Arabic
Research has shown that more than 2
2 million people can speak it out of a total population of 66 million
( Due to the immigration )
It might be Portuguese, the Portuguese are the largest minority in France
German or Spanish
In my region, it's probably italian tho
I thought it was German
I did french as my mother language
still know nothing about
I did Spanish as a second language for 5 years of my life, but I now know absolutely nothing
Oh true my bad I forgot about the title
Same thing over here, I have colleagues in their early 20s who don't know where to find a file in Windows, have never heard of CTRL-F for a searching in a text, CTRL-C for copy or CTRL-V for paste
Most of them don't even know you're not supposed to turn off the PC by pressing the power button
I blame Apple
lol
&#x200B;
EDIT: I made a typo
I feel like when you know Napster you where a hacker and we had the first Debian redhat, the web 2
0, I learned php3 and was offered a great job we played alot with computers, now people are just lazy and want to edit videos to get mega bucks on YouTube you use a telephone they don't have the same chances that we had
For sure
I am a nurse, and sadly, we use computers a lot, everyday
I'd say 20% of our time at work, that we should spend with the patients instead
We use them for medical data, prescriptions, transmissions, and lots of administrative stuff that we have to do ourselves because of budget cuts
Sorry CTRL-V, typo
lol
Over here it’s everywhere
Feels like it’s barely regulated
Idk about other countries in Europe but here it’s super accessible even delivered n stuff
We're the first country in the EU when talking about joints
But in France weed is less popular than haschisch, the cannabis' resin
Which is worst than weed because you role the joint with tobacco and the resin is heavily cut with everything dealers can find
So that's that
But yeah, whether it's weed or hash, pretty popular
Edit: popular into younger generation, less when we're talking about 40 or 50 something
Its more popular in my highscool than tobacco
In my class, half the students smoke at least once a week
Weed is more like a trend among students and dealers are recognized
It’s easy to buy some and you often enough smell it in the streets, but it’s not everywhere either
Some places are known for outside smoking (bits of Montmartre, Les Halles in Paris
) whereas it’s pretty much unknown to others (to keep the example of Paris, you’ll pretty much never smell weed in the Invalides and the whole 7th arrondissement for example)
Also, the police doesn’t really care about smokers, but an arrested dealer faces real charges
Rennes is like weed city
I don't know where you live, but i'd say you are extremely over exagerating and giving missleading information
> We are among the first consumers in Europe
YES we finally bit you to something
Vogli fumare una canna ? (Don't judge I've tried my best)
Which country
I live in Grenoble and I don’t really know about Paris but over here dealers are rarely arrested
The idea is if they stop dealing drugs they’ll commit more harmful crimes like theft so they kinda let them do their thing
Yeah, Sainte Anne has a constant faint smell of weed almost
J’exagère pas à Grenoble c’est comme ça
Yes, that’s Montmartre for you
(Agreed it’s strange place for a smoke, but hey: the view is great)
Je pense que tu donnes la vision d'un enfant de 20 ans
Ça n'est pas la réalité des choses
Sono così stupido ! Oh imparato l'Italiano in lyceo, ma sono incapace di lo parlo corretamente !
Funny enough I live in Drôme which is just at the Alpes border, si you've never been so right !
Well, that's exactly what happened to me with my Italian
Still achieve to have 17/20 at my bac, but they do not seem to care a lot about our LV2
I just checked and it's a 2h drive from my town
But beware, do not mistake la Drôle Provençale and La Provence
They aren't the same region
La Provence is way more South
La Drôme Provençale is a part of Drôle that looks like Provence but isn't really a part of the region :D
I told you I couldn't speak Italian for shit
I am under the impression that they fool a lot of people
I'm happy you loved my département
Well you're almost my brother then
I visited Italy 3 times when I was younger
Really nice country
I miss it, I haven't been there for almost 7 years now
Please send me arancini al ragu
I miss them
Edit: spelling
Mathis, Matthis, Matis, Mathys
I've actually seen a Matthyss
Christelle also
Christèle, Christel, Krystèle, Kristelle and it goes on
Some parents absolutely want to be original so they just add a random amount of h or double consonants, so their kid has a "unique" name
(I'm a teacher, I can't tell you how annoying it is to remember all the different spellings)
Some very fun French spellings of American names too : Brayan, Stéci
Haha, didn't know Kevins had an international reputation, I thought it was only in France
Poor Kevins !
>Some parents absolutely want to be original so they just add a random amount of h or double consonants, so their kid has a "unique" name
Or they change the spelling randomly: Lorànt, because Laurent was too mainstream
>Some very fun French spellings of American names too : Brayan, Stéci
I've met a Rayane once
I just use Deepl and no probleme with that
If anything the golden standard of fluency is being able to decrypt the language in its most vile and twisted forms
I'll never consider myself truely fluent until I can feel at ease with Hiberno-English
That is, in all honesty, never
Sweet old "what are personal pronouns again
" latin language
My girlfriend is Romanian and she tends to make this little mistake too
You know, I took some Italian lessons at university à few years ago(actually, 10 years ago, damn), and it was probably easier to drop the pronouns for us than to add them for you guys
Btw, is the use of personal pronouns a common mistake among French people speaking italian
What's wrong with it
Good to know ! Now that I think of it, it was more pointed as uncommon than an actual mistake indeed
Thanks !
I don't know if that counts but I left France 5 yrs ago to live outside Europe
I am now living in South America
I believe it has been one of the best decisions, if not the best, of my life
I am from Southern France but moved to Paris a couple of years after graduating, because well, if you are a bit ambitious, you have so many more options in Paris
Well a lot of factors led me to take the decision to move abroad, but quality of life has been one big decision factor
In Paris, even though I was having a very decent job with a very decent pay, my daily life was miserable, with 1hrs30 to 2 hrs time in the terrible transportation system of Paris back and forth, the same public transportation workers who decide to go on strike for weeks if not for months about every year, making your life even more miserable, horribly expensive housing market, and a depressing weather, added to that a very stressful job, and I ended up doing a burn out
Today I live in a much nicer area compared to where I was living in Paris, my residence has indoor pool, sauna, open air barbecue, and a futbol 5 (micro football is how it is called internationally
) field
I go to work within 20 minutes, and even if my paycheck is lower, my spending power is way better
I could make several good friends so my social life also improved
Of course I miss France, the food, my friends and family, but for instance, safety wise, it is different but not worse, at least for me, even though I know I live in a country that is, on average, way more violent than France
The one thing that is absolutely true, your problems travel with you
Some people are moving abroad to try and get away from their own problems, this is a huge mistake
With the struggles to settle down in another place, your own issues feel even more acute
Yes, I am now living in Germany and very happy there
It is hard to envision coming back to live in France as it is so very centralized, and Paris is unlivable (incredibly crowded and expensive)
I don’t really know what the future holds for me
Moved to Ireland 2017 in order to find better prospects for my career
No regerts
Rents are crazy expensive in Dublin, so you might not have to live with your parents anymore but you might consider living with roommates
I had a really boring job when I first arrived
But it taught me a lot about corporate life and I made a ton of friends
After a while it allowed me to access a better position that required a higher degree of qualification and I really enjoyed it
Then I got a fairly high paying job in one of Dublin's tech company
I now realise that the money was maybe not worth it
As someone who lived on 600 euros intern compensation and unemployment checks, I was able to live comfortably even in the lowest paid job because I could manage my money
But don't focus too much on that
It's all about growing as a person, wonder about money and retirement pension when you're 25 or 30
Left France for the UK almost 5 years ago because of better job prospects
I'm lucky to have found a position in a solid, global company since as Brexit was voted 3 months after my arrival
I originally planned on going home after 3 years with more professional experience, but I've fallen in love and I'm about to marry a EU national who only speaks English and his native language, so unless we both manage to WFH full-time I don't see that happening before 15 years from now
I'm French, I love France but I always had issues with the overall mentality, my field was not really open to 'outsiders', I wanted to learn English, I flew to the UK to study a master degree
Although I must say I had 'good' student jobs when I was in France, it was easy for me to find waitressing jobs, and I supported myself during my studies
But other things (mostly social and the 'French mentality' that everyone accepts and justifies) made me want to leave, which I did
The first time was in the UK, I was a student, had a blast, learnt English, got my master, everything was fine and fun
Afterwards, I went back to France for around a year
I was still unsure that I was ready to leave everything behind, I had a job opportunity in Paris, and I spent a year there
Everything that I hate about France was 10 times worse
Sexism, normalisation of sexual abuses, etc etc, patronising co-workers, never feeling safe being alone, I was made fun of because I spoke English (not like random English words in all sentences, but I was dating an expat), and many others
I short, I was fairly unhappy
One 'incident' was my last straw
I found a job (took 3 weeks) and two weeks after the interview I was arriving in the Netherlands with my life packed in 2 suitcases
It's been more than 3 years, and I'm thriving here
My life conditions improved 10 times, I am surrounded by good people, the people are mostly super nice, I'm just happy to be here
And by no means I'm saying everything here is rainbow and unicorn
I struggled, a lot, and still am
Covid hit hard for me, I'm currently unemployed, it's not all perfect, but I love it
I do feel homesick, I miss my family, I have a couple of friends still in France, I miss the French social policies (health insurance, retirement funds, etc)
And you, as an Italian is going to miss something big: the food
To quote my old teacher 'how could she move to a country with such poor food and wine when she loves it so much'!
I think I also needed an escape from long terms issues, from toxic people surrounding me, but then what was the point of staying if I was starting 'fresh'. But all of that made me grow a lot, learn to know and love myself because when I arrived, I was alone, for quite some while, and I had to be okay with that
It can be lonely for some, although if you're planning and studying and working you'll meet people
I became much more comfortable meeting people, I forced myself to go outside my comfort zone
And now, I'm waiting for an answer from a job interview, I've found my partner, we're planning on buying our place in the upcoming years
I saw you are considering a PhD in the future, maybe check out the Netherlands, don't know your field but check it out here ;)
I'm french and I left my home country to go the UK 3 years ago to do a PhD
Now that I'm almost done, I'll be coming back home, but honestly, I kind of hope to move back away from france again after my postdoctoral contract
The salary are outrageously low for public researcher in France
No shit the researchers are leaving the country
Anyway, I'm freaking loving it in the uk
Although france is very prone to patting itself on the back for their universalism and secularism, they still cry like babies whenever they see a veil on tv
In the UK there are no such bullshit
I believe they are much more inclusive with a "you do you" kind of mentality
For what it's worth, I'm in Bristol, and it may be something that is very specific to the city, but I found it very welcoming and inclusive
I love the place
After Covid, when my situation will allow it, I'm moving to Italy
I left France in late 2009 for Vietnam then China, came back in 2015
I was in my late 20's, single, freshly out of university with no debt but no possession either
France seemed boring to me back then
Although the job market was not the best back then in Europe, my motivation was mostly a wish for change and adventure
It turned out to be a good move carrier-wise, and I got my fill of change and adventure for a lifetime
I like "boring" now
OP, this is the answer you're looking for
I was in a similar situation and Spanish/Italian population is certainly a thing
What do you love the most about France a French culture if I may ask
Because Latin culture is quite different from the Scandinavian one from what I've gathered here
> Smart, practical people
This is a blessing and a curse, though
Sometimes, and especially when you're young, you'll want a bit more "spirit" in your life than good old Protestant work ethic :p
What is it that you wanna do ? I've seen lots of Italians in Ireland and I find it surprising
In my opinion Italy is really not that bad
Everyone knows about the regional disparity but Milan and Turin have much more to offer than Dublin I think
Thank you good sir
Having a Burn out then
In Colombia
It is in my handle
Nowhere as much as in Dublin, and I'm saying this as a Mokumer
Thank you for speaking so well of my country and region
As always we take our ways of living for granted and do not realize  the bright sides
We French are especially good at seeing the negative aspects of our society
Wow, thank you very much for such a thorough answer
The "closeness" of Danes was what I was referring to when I said that our culture was different
Most Scandinavian on this sub describe it as following the norm and being quite withdrawn on themselves
I guess it might be a stereotype, but I feel like, as you described, we're more open on different paths in life
And one thing is sure is that most people don't really care about what other think of them
Your neighbour exemple was quite interesting, I didn't know it was a thing in Denmark, and once again as you said it's not something you'll find here
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you, but might I have you opinion on what you dislike in France on the other hand
Something you'd like to ameliorate
Because as another French said, we do take some things for granted, and it's always cool to have another pov
I checked & even the Vatican vicinity is not too bad lol
Dublin has become a major international hub for all sorts of business and I myself have to go there from time to time for work, but it just doesn't strike me as some place to settle down
Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's because it's growing too rapidly for the infrastructure to catch up
It takes time to expand cities organically like most existing metropolis
> it just doesn't strike me as some place to settle down
It's a farily unique city and I do think it's shit for the classic definition of "settling down", eg a suburban house with the wife and the dogs
However, Dublin has a gritty charm and a soul that I've yet to find elsewhere
Well, no, Paris has as much spirit as Dublin I think, only very differently
If you're annoyed by things not being nice or clean or neat, if you like things to run smoothly, Dublin is not great
But if you can look past that, there's a wealth of culture, fun and knowledge to be found there
Yes, but people do live outside of centrum, but within the ring
Dublin's housing issues extend well beyond D1/D2
>I don't think it'll surprise anyone when I say the slowness of anything bureaucratic or government related:)
Yep, just as expected, lmao
I have to send my RIB/IBAN for my future healthcare reimbursements by actual mail
I totally expected to upload a .pdf on some website but no, I have to use paper and mail it like it's 1973
Of course, I should've known
Yeah we're still an old country that is very *very* reluctant to change and improvement, especially digital-wise
Yes, I was going to say the downside of established metropolis, like Paris, is that old buildings are literally falling apart
Ireland has a great opportunity to build from the ground up and be modern
And of course the liveliness and energy
It feels different every time I visit
I haven't read the book, but the author made a ted talk that you can find on YouTube if I'm not mistaken
I lived in D1 and worked around Parnell, then on East Wall, after a year at UCD
So yeah I've seen the suburbs but it's not the most fascinating area of Dublin :p
I would not give too much credit to this ideal world of parenting, tbh
Regarding food, maybe there is something more or less true, you will find in France pretty elaborate baby food that really taste like real food
And if you look at typical pre school and primary school menus, you will understand that food is a lot more diverse and somewhat more healthy than in the US
Now, babies having full nights at the age of 4 months, sorry but no
Exceptions maybe, and then starting 6 or 8 months, you can start hoping to get 5 or maybe even 6 hrs of sleep
Otherwise, French parents are just struggling as much as US parents I guess, we may be a bit more strict in establishing rules and boundaries, but it is really a case by case basis
>Haha, I'm sorry I dont have something more original
Don't be sorry for saying something that's 100% true
As someone from the Côte d'Azur, glad you like it here
Oh there's an explanation for this one actually
It comes from WWII
As you must know France collaborated with Germany and gave *a lot* of jews during the war
We even gave more than what Germany asked
They mostly wanted men, and we gave them women and children
So the idea behind not having a register is simply: you can't find/give informations that might be dangerous in certain times and periods if said register simply does not exists
I'm not well versed on whether we had such a register during WWII or not, but you see how simple it would've been to find and send jews to camps with such register existing
I'm not explaining it too well and I'm sorry
But the idea is having such a register would have more flaws and bad sides than good ones
We also just aren't too keen on the idea of a centralised register of data overall
I can't explain it, but just thinking about such a thing makes me feel awkward
There's a whole big brother vibe to this
To be clear, I don't mind gritty, I actually enjoyed it very much
I'd much rather spend time in Smithfield (at least what it was 10 years ago) than in D4
Well, you can do DNA test from what I know
A lot of youtubers did when they went viral some years ago
I also thought about doing one and the websites were all available AND in French
As for the trust in the government, I think we've got some genuine concern seeing our history
I already talked about what the government did during WWII, but even today, they are trying their best to do whatever is best for them and their friends, and little for citizens
They don't take what we say and think into account
So it makes some sense that we're being wary of it
I'm not saying it should be this way in every country
Just that it is perfectly logical in a French context
I would love to be able to have such kind of register and stuff
But I do not believe in the "system is there to help them and to make their life easier". Because even if it was true, if it was created with such intent and purposes, there will always be a slight chance that one day someone decides to use it in a bad way
It is going to sound *really* pessimistic, but I'd rather never have such kind of infrastructure, because the downfall of such things could be abysmal
But I feel like such wariness from the government is a latine thing more than just a French one
I am under the impression that Spain, Italy and Portugal also don't trust and like their government too much
(Sorry Romania, I know you're always forgotten when people talk about roman countries, but I must admit that I don't know jack shit about your political landscape
Not that I'm an expert on the former three)
> It is a funny thing, Danish people are more closed off and like their personal space, but are fine with anyone being able to look up their address and phone number
French people are much more open and chatty but wouldn't want just anyone to get their phone number
I dont know how to explain that, but it is interesting
it is indeed very funny
I didn't thought about it, but it's quite the realisation actually
I don't really know what to say or think about that right now
But it seems like something to think about and consider about our relationship to government and politics
edit: for the last part, now that I think about for more than 5s it just makes sens to me
Those information are private ones
Of course nobody should have access to them
I can be chatty if I want, it doesn't mean I have to tell you those things
It just seems overly dangerous and a major breach of personal life and basic privacy to have those data available to just anybody
edit 2: When I say I'd love to have such registers I mean, I'd love to have such a trust into the government
The first edit made this assessment weird
Sorry
In French we have the adjective "ferroviaire" to things related to trains and railways (like "réseau ferroviaire", railway network)
Railway is "chemin de fer" and the actual train track is "voie ferrée".
Not really, even the most mountainous areas will have small towns and villages not that far away
I guess one would need to go overseas, to the Amazon forest in French Guiana, in a place with no native tribes, or on Clipperton Island, where you'd die without food or water in a matter of days
Not really, the population in rural areas is very much spread out and the landscape is either plains, forests or used for agriculture by inhabitants of a nearby village, even in the leadt densely populated areas
However, overseas departments and territories are probably very different, I wouldn't really know about that
I once heard that London can technically be classified as a forest, due to the ratio of trees/area
It's just a very populated forest then
It really depends on the country
Nicolas Sarkozy's father was born in Hungary, it was never brought up
Manuel Valls is born in Spain, it became a problem only when he decided to go there and start a short-lived political carrier
The mayor of Paris is from Spanish descent as well, it is brought up by the opposition from time to time but with no effect
Now if said politician was from some specific countries with which France has a more troublesome history,  it would definitely be brought up and would gain way more traction with the general public
I'm thinking a politician born in Algeria for example
We had french prime minister that was born in Spain I believe and all the reproaches had was about his way to do his job not really where he was born
So I would guess it shouldn't be a problem for a French President
It'd definitely be a bit controversial but I don't know how much, like, Sarkozy had one of his parents not born in France and it wasn't controversial at all, so I don't know
The former PM, Manuel Valls, has dual French and Spanish citizenship
For the most part it would not be a problem, in fact you'd be surprised by how many prominent politicians (especially socialists for some reason) were born in foreign countries
I disagree that Sarkozy's heritage never came up, but it wasn't used against him
Valls (former PM) did not acquire French citizenship until he turned 20, and Hidalgo (current mayor of Paris) at 14
They are good examples
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing was born in Coblence, Germany
I wasn’t born when he was President, but I’ve never heard anyone bring it up
So, we actually already had a President that was born in a foreign country and it never was a story to my knowledge
However this would probably be very different for a foreign-born or naturalised candidate
Remember Eva Joly’s candidacy
Yeah the reversible vest as we call it
Like would a French politician born in the UK be met with defiance, unlike one born in Spain for example ?
I mean if the guy is a French citizen, speaks French and demonstrated that he loves France over the UK, I don't see why not
That rivalry pretty much died out, except for sports
That would definitely not be a problem, nor would it be for any other European country
As it has been said, many of our political leaders were born abroad or are direct children of immigrants and it's never really been an issue
I had no idea, but tbf this case is a bit special
The mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo and former PM Manuel Valls were both born in Spain and nobody cares
True, true, I was wrong then
What newspapers in your country does the government fear ?
In France, for a century, a newspaper called "Le Canard Enchainé" (The Duck in Chains) has been known for releasing regularly news that shake the power to its core, sometimes leading to the downfall of politicians
François Fillon, that was supposed to lead the right wing to victory in 2017, lost in a pitiful way after it was revealed that he employed his wife at the parliament for years, while said wife never set foot in the building (it is one of many examples)
The newspaper relies on very solid sources, sometimes other politicians leaking an info that could weaken an opponent
Anyway, does your country count with such a media ?
Funny thing about this newspaper
It is released every Wednesday morning, but institutions, national agencies, and media groups can have it if they send someone at the newspaper office, between 5 and 6 PM on the Tuesday evening
That way, they have a twelve hour headstart on their PR response
If you pass by on the street, you can see a line of courriers and men in suits, waiting for the journal, praying to not be inside
Also "Canard" (Duck) is another word for:
- In old popular Parisian French, at the beginning of French journalism, someone who sells newspapers, and shouts to gain attention (GET THIS NEWSPAPER
ONLY X PRICE
They're called a duck because of the shouts
It then became a word to reference any bad journal/newspaper/etc (in Paris), any journal that are so-so
- In the late 19th century, it can also mean a fake news/gossip
So this a really amusing name for a newspaper known for their investigations
Mediapart in France too
Charlie Hebdo was kind of good too
Should have mentionned Mediapart as well
And security is impressive as well
There are always one or two gendarmes standing guard during the distribution
What's also quite interesting is that there are no ads in this newspaper : the cost of printing is quite low (8 pages each week most in B&W except for the first and last), the price hasn't gone up with the €, and the whole cost is covered by the subscription and sale
It's to ensure that the newspaper remains independent
Does media part has a printed version
To be fair they do work quite often hand in hand with le canard enchaîné
Was
It still exists
But they were never into news, only satire
Was it ever an objective for any Irish Gov to make irish the dominant language on the island or not so much ?
"In 1979, the newspaper reveals that President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was offered diamonds by the Central African dictator and emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa
"VGE" tries to defend itself, without much success
Two years later, he lost the presidential election to François Mitterrand
Granted this is an old case, but I would say this is considered as their biggest scoop
Mostly right wing, but I wouldn't say they make quarters
It's just that the left is rarely in power in France
No, i don't think so for the printed version
You can see here an article pointing out some differences :
Satire are often about currents events
So almost like news
Didn't understand anything but sounds cool
Absolutely,  he didn't get a free pass
We don't really have that
Scotland, because we both hate England
The US may be
We’ve been friends since the US is the US and we’ve always had each other’s back
Like De Gaulle said: "France doesn't have friends, just interests"
France and Germany are best friends since the end of WW2 I think
Much love from your neighbors
>we don’t have friends,we have interests
More or less a citation from De Gaulle
You would have liked him
Well Spain used to be ruled by our archrivals the Habsburgs, and then the Napoleon thing happened, we never were true allies like you and England were
It's either Scotland or the US
The term guerilla was invented by Spaniards fighting the French Empire
Plus, Habsurgs
Scotland is the traditional answer for us, but in reality it's more like the US, despite recent (freedom fries, Trump) events
We were pretty friendly with most of the peninsula throughout the Middle Ages, providing them with bored nobles looking for a bit of a scuffle (your very country being founded by one of those), but the Hapsburgs really spoiled the broth
We don't really care because you're our colony since 1066 tbh
Les Etats Unis ?? La bonne blague
Damn picky you are : )
Je dis pas ça de bon coeur, je les aime pas plus que toi
Not really but I have travelled a lot and I swear the U.S army sells merch
Mostly in asia, I have seen so many U.S navy shirts and shit in regular stores it's wild
Also, I live in SK right now and people usually have french phrases on their shirts, and I am pretty sure they don't actually know what is written on their shirts
Tons
And plenty more with meaningless *french* words on it
Yes, and I even own one or two shirts like this
My favourite one has a photo and captions related to an earthquake that happened in Japan
Good fun
I have a hoodie that has that, they're quite common and nobody cares it doesn't mean anything
It sets off a time bomb in me whenever I see someone wearing clothing that just says "FASHION". I have imploded 10000000 times now
Vivre, Rire, Baguette
Very crude and infantile in a lot of ways, and it lacks that dry (and often rather depressing) edge that you see in a lot of Northern European humor
Still, I don't mind it so much
I find it translates to (or perhaps is just more reflective of) a more direct and straightforward culture in France as a whole, which I find infinitely preferable to forced smiles, internal dissonance, and excessive overthinking about *every social interaction you ever have*. We just don't really have patience for anxiety-inducing nonsense like that
I'd say it depends
It's heavily reliant on wordplay and situational humour which can both be infantile or refined
IMO "Kaamelott" is a great example of what french humour is about
Because that is what you here about, especially for younger generation
There are a lot of other styles for one-man-shows
Best example would be Gustave Parking, who makes shows based a lot on poetry of the words, but that don't get much recognition
Fair enough, and I didn't mean to come across as dismissive or anything
Kaamelott is indeed a great example
My take should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, anyways - I'm certainly not the one amongst my friends known for cracking jokes
Maybe I should just move to Germany
Wordplays and situational humour, I agree 100% with that
That was my first thought
Most classic French humour are the likes of Louis de Funes or Les Nuls which are basically those notions, along with cultural references
There's also a weird layer of linguistic humour
Some phrases that are not funny in themselves but that said this way become funny either by the out of context language level or a sudden strategically placed insult
I'm thinking of Audiard's dialogues as a prime example of this but Kaamelott also does it to an extend
This reminds me of when Sarkozy was president and he gave a speech where he sounded and looked really drunk
Turns out he was completely sober, what happened was that he had a little « friendly » chitchat with Putin right before he got up on stage
Knowing that I actually think it’s impressive he didn’t piss his pants where he stood
Not a real nervous breakdown, but prime ministet Jean Castex was looking for his glasses for a solid minute
They were right under his nose, literally
A very funny moment
Pain au chocolat vs chocolatine, but it is getting old imo
[PARCE QUE C'EST NOTRE PROJET
[Le Pen trying to mock Macron but simply managing to look insane and ridiculize herself in public]
That's gotta be about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, in the semi-finals we played Belgium and they dominated the game but still lost
Some Belgian fans and players were pretty salty about it and yeah there are a lot of chances now that if you're getting salty in France someone will say "Ok Belgium" , "65% possession" or some stuff related to that
French people complaining about how much they complain in any conditions or governement and going into protest
The french railways society being ALWAYS late
Bryan iz in de kitcheun
- (since the last presidential elections) When Macron was campaining he yelled at one of his rallies "parce que c'est notre projet !" (because this is our project !) so loudly his voice broke, and now it's a meme and people will yell that sentence in a exaggerated manner everytime then can (anytime the word project is used basically)
- (for a very long time and still ongoing) North vs South war over the correct word to use for pastries (pain au chocolat or chocolatine)
I send students on exchange programmes to Universität Bielefeld and I chuckle everytime I see the name
It got old a year ago, but I think it's mostly an internet thing, isn't it
Normal people don't give a shit about this "debate".
[MAMMA MIA, Marcello ! That's not how you hold a pistol !]
Haha we have same "he was there at the creation of the Earth" joke for Valery Giscard D'Estaing, a former french president who is still very much alive today despite being already close to 50 when he got elected in 1974
The louder the better
I'd add OSS 117 and Kamelot for the internet crowd
> We should give independence to Catalonia, declare war and then surrender so they annex us and we are back United
Haha Spain playing 4D chess
Where is my umbrella
I see we share far more than our flag's colours
Why
Is he corrupt
I think this stereotype exists pretty much everywhere
They still do
And it's pain au chocolat damn it
Hey ! I am the host of a debate group in which we confront this question weekly
Not for all eternity, he's just Putin off the election
Ok I'm let myself  out
Hey do you have a mustache
If you don't then don't FUCKIN

THIS
EVER
you forgot Michel Drucker !
[ROCK ON
Fucking Kaamelott fans
c’est pas faux
What she says is not really noteworthy honestly, it's more the whole attitude and her laughing like a maniac that is cringy as fuck
She just says "they are everywheeeere, in our citiiiies, in our countrysiiiiide".
I really like soviet jokes, they have that hint of self-mockery also found in jewish jokes told by Jewish
WTF, that's the official Conservatives channel
You guys are going full american mode
About 4/5th of the country call [this] a "pain au chocolat". The last fifth (the south west) call it "chocolatine".
There is a nice rivalry about this, however everyone knows the pain au chocolat is the true winner by a very large margin
Google is right :) It literally means "At the good bread", a kind of way to say "where the bread is good".
It's usually bought together, and would be classified as the same "type" of goods, however it's not the same cooking process and can't be called a croissant
Edit : also, don't apologize for your ignorance about something
A fool asking a question is only a fool for a few minutes
A fool not asking is one for life
I used to follow the news but since about 6 months it's all covid brexit and trump
The best i can do is ask alaxa for flash info in the morning and live my life
I follow politics of our most powerful neighbors so the UK's politics (but I think everyone did with the Brexit) and Germany's politics
I also have ideas that are probably very stereotyped or just not true like Italy has a corrupted president, Turkey, Poland, Hungary and Austria have crazy nationalist presidents and the Netherlands have a cool president
Usually I look up to politics of neighboring countries like Italy, Luxembourg, Germany
I also often looks up at the news from European Parliament and other European institutions
Not really
I just followed the Brexit 4 yrs dramasoap, and though this, discovered how low standards has become the UK's  political life
Other than that I have no idea of what's the political news in the other European countries
Since I live really close to the German and Swiss border I follow both countries really closely
I even follow the local politics of Baden-Wurttemberg and Basel Kanton since it can have a huge impact on us
Les médias français sont de pires en pires je trouve

As an ignorant American, what do you mean “without government”?
Thanks for the explanation
The Amazon Forest in Guiana
No one around for miles except for illegal gold miners
And huge-ass spiders
Funny because another comment also mentioned scary undergrounds in Brno
Czechia sure is a frightening place
Any mountain even
Strong chances you’re fucked at this point
I thought about Paris's underground tunnels (not just the catacombs -it' s gigantic-), but unlike what would happen if I came face to face with a skull, I would probably have a heart attack if I saw one of those spiders
That's extremely creepy, thanks for sharing
Same
Cant find anything on google
It's very common, but we even start drinking before that
I know I drank 12 beers at a family gathering when I was 13, I drank wine or cider with my parents
Of course high school parties were way worse but it's not when I started drinking alcohol
Well I'm going to oppose the trend here : in France, it's not *that* prevalent for an european country, or at least not in the 14-15 years old range
Most underage drinking is like when you're 17 (drinking age is 18)
We have quite a weird relationship to alcohol anyway, we love our booze as much as the English but less in a binge way, more in a casual way
We call that *alcoolisme ordinaire* (ordinary alcoholism), like drinking a single glass of wine just like you'd drink glass of soda, for the taste of it
Right, but highschool is where you really start to have drinking between young people, as opposed to young people being allowed to drink by adults
In France, there are only 11 political parties and only 4 of them share the majority of the votes
It's not great, but at least it's not a two-party system
I don't understand how the Brits and Americans can stand it
Any Bielorussian or Russian to answer the question
Like 6-7 parties ... Very healthy demecracy
Having just 2 parties would sound like dictatorship to us
And again, the 4 majority political parties are like coalisions since most of them have different currents with different tendencies within them
Action Contre La Faim, not for the fun but for an ethical principle
I technically have benefits from it but I don't really use it but my membership to the association Neurchi de Bières (a French beergeek FB group that became an association)
&#x200B;
It's still young and one of the benefits is a reduction code on a beer webshop
But being currently in Paris I don't really command online (when I was in Epinal it's was nearly mandatory, not that much now)
I buy anime Blue Ray that I like after torrenting them
I don't even have anything to read them
Books in bookshop
I feel like the only places I really like to be are places with many bookshops compared to the size of the city
Also: FUCK Amazon
Pourquoi pas
A "Ouais, t'as raison ouais" said with strong disdain is a great way to anger someone
Yep "touché" is French, for some reason it got exported as an Anglo expression, and it seems, in Italy too
We don't really use it in that kind of sense in France though
Given name + family name is the standard
Some people wear both parents family names with an hyphen in between (for instance "Valéria Bruni-Tedeschi")
Most people also have a second or even a third given name that appear on the ID but are never used irl
I have three for instance, and it's common to give some relative name
On top of my name, my parents gave me the ones of two great-grandfathers
In France, at least in culturally Christian families, there's the first name, the godfather's first name, one grandparent's first name, then the surname
One given name + possibly one, two or three middle names + either your father's or mother's or both last names
It is more common to only take your father's name because if hundreds of year of patriarchy, but it is becoming more and more common to take both name
But it basically comes down to this kinda name:
Juliette Martin
Nicolas Renaud
Marie Dupond
Patrice Rousseau
We only state our middle names for bureaucracy and stuff
>Most people also have a second or even a third given name that appear on the ID but are never used irl
I only have one given name, AMA
Some people have even more than three, I for example have four given names (as do all my family)
The order goes this way: given name + name of The Godfather/godmother + name of the grandfather/grandmother + name of the other grandfather/grandmother (as I have an older sister, she has the grandmothers’ names and I have the great-grandmothers’ names)
Is this like Russians do
Like Vladimir Vladimirovitch  Tchaikovsky or Sergueï Mikhaïlovitch Eisenstein
Legally we can go up to 6 I think
Hum now not really
You can name your child whatever you want as long as it's not against the baby's best interest
Like if you wanted to call it "Nutella" (which apparently has been the case) the civil official has/must stop you
The family is then asked to choose another name and if they don't want/don't find something else than it's the civil official that can name the child
Edit: why would you think that there is such list
No, but the local authorities can reject a given name if they think it could be prejudicial to the kid
There is no list of names, but there is a list of letters that are used in french, and therefor some accents you can't use
This has created some issues, because some regional names cannot be used
For example "ñ" is not a letter used in french, but it is used in breton so parents that want to name their son Fañch have to go to court to be able to use the name
Every country does this
Germany and the Holocaust is the exception
Every country wants to move on and forget the horrors it participated in/directly commited in the past
Not saying it's right, but Belgium is no different than France, the US, or any other country in this regard
Dead fighting for Napoléon probably
Doing what all of my ancestors did
Farming
well I would be getting ready for a revolution or two
But my family got sent to Algeria like 30 years later so assuming I would have managed like my predecessors I would work for the government until I was killed in a revolution or coup d'etat if unlucky, or banished to a colony best case scenario
Had I been born 100 years earlier (1893), I would have been German and would likely have fought as a german during WW1
Glad to see my single year of ancient greek finally come of use ! "Liberty or death" ?
It is optional in high school, but I dropped out of that class after a year because it was incredibly boring at the time
In hindsight, it was interesting and I should've paid attention
Unfortunately, democracies are on the decline
Everywhere, states become more authoritarian especially in Africa, South America, Asia and even Easter Europe
The total number of democracies is dropping worldwide and the ones left degrade
Dictatorship are even perceived as increasingly attractive, including by people living in democracies thanks to China and Russia soft powers
So obviously the left ones MUST stand with each other, stay strong and cope together with dictatorships and freedom-repressive policies until one day people living in current authoritarian states aim for freedom, revolt against their governments and overthrow them
I know you mean well but Taiwanese think of themselves as Taiwanese, not as Chinese
The "legitimate Chinese government" is something they're forced to claim if they don't want PRC to invade
PRC is the main proponent of the "Republic of China" fiction
The Taiwanese government and most of the population would love nothing more than to be officially called Taiwan, but China won't let it
I don't know if it's a French thing (it probably isn't) but I've always heard Laponie (Lapland) as being his home, specifically Rovaniemi
It funny to see proud Finns, and Swedes trying to discredit them
I grew up hearing Lapland and North Pole about equally
Same
Although it was already almost a tie between them when I was a kid
Laponie or the North Pole for me
I'd have answered the North Pole on instinct, but it seems like someone (Finland probably) has really been pushing for Lapland in the last decades
A resurrected half-god with wholes in his hands and feet, breaking and entering into people's homes to bring gifts to children in the middle of the night
That reads like a creepy pasta
Are Icelandic children actually taught to believe in the Yule Cat ? Because it sounds absolutely terrifying (but I love it)
The Christmas what now
Christmas news
What is that
Makes sense, no tourism money in the North Pole
The mental image of baby Jesus falling down the chimney with a Nintendo 64 is just too much for me to handle
It just ... Keeps improving
I need to doodle this
Shortly after "Taken" came out, and American girl asked me if it was safe to visit Paris, as she genuinely thought kidnapping young women and selling them at auction was a thing there
I've had many people believe that we French people casually cheat on each other on a daily basis
We don't, it's something the upper classes do or used to do (at least in movies), most of the population doesn't.
When I was learning chinese in High school we  had some chinese students coming to our school
I had 3 of them
They bielieved we were rich, like the entire country (I'm french ) and one even asked us to pay so he could come study here in college , the entire 3  years, with accomodation, food and transport
He sincerly bileved it would be easy for us to pay this, like if he was asking for a new pair of shoes or a cinema ticket
I had to tell him that we were not poor but average/average low, wich mean we could afford a cinema or even a restaurant like 3 or 4 times per years without trouble but couldn't pay for this
I myself had to work as a student and live with 3 roomate to share the bill
Then I save money and went to see them in their country and understood that the medias and their school made them see France as very rich place where everyone is pretty, rich, elegant, were it's all about romance and wine and castle etc
Some chinese tourists are so disappointed when they arrived that they created a programm to help them with depression after they arrived
Funny I see this post today
Yesterday some guy on Facebook insisted pasta with sugar was a common Parisian dish
An American once asked me if they sold guns in my village
Not me but a friend who was working at a tourist information center at La Bastille place in Paris was asked by many tourists where the Bastille prison is
Not where it was before it was demolished
Where it is now today, as in where the actual building is and when it opens for visits
The worst part was a French woman once asked that question too
Same with French people
I actually acquired a lot of wine knowledge because everyone kept asking me to chose the wine, even though I had no clue
I learned through trial and error: pick the house wine
I love the conclusion about bear
Great/good
Also, some people do believe that we eat frogs and snails on a daily basis
Oh, and tourists asking for "typical French food” in ultra-marine territories, expecting to be given boeuf bourguignon, raclette, fondue savoyarde or pot-au-feu
when it’s _super hot_ outside, and they come here at this time of the year _precisely_ because it’s hot and sunny and the beach
Honestly, depending on how old he might have know quite a bit, didn’t he
Alcohol consumption was something else back in the days
Plus, the famous brands are easy recommendations, and there are enough of these for about every occasion
I’m French and abroad and the old restaurant I used to work at loved to have me behind the bar for that reason
Apparently it sells better if you can pronounce Chardonnay properly
Who buys pasta in a jar
That “Probably because they’re drunk when they do it” was magnificent
Thanks for sharing
The VLE used by most public and private French schools (let's say 80%), Pronote, had a flaw that allowed the download of the enitre database remotly
The developpers took 3 months to fix it
Yep, that's us
Not even surprised
efface ça neveu
yes, some are still using Win 98, or even Win 95
If you just need a computer to do a simple task and you built a program to do it back then in the 90s, why will you change it
That'll be stupid to buy a brand new computer with Win 10 on it just to re-write a program to do the exact same thing as it was doing on Win 95
Rentre chez toi ruscaille
Dépaysement
It happens when you're in another country (or a place you're not usually in), and you truly feel like you're out of your routine, your usual habits
I wish I could translate perfectly routine too
And maybe also retrouvailles
finding again something/someone you cherished, a heartful reunion
On a daily basis, or at least a word I use much more often, is regard
The way a person looks at things, their look, their eyes
It’s more a question of nuance than a real "there is no translation and that bothers me": I often find myself faced with one unique English noun or adjective where we have several in French -there’s a lot of nuance lost, but it’s still understandable
bugs me out
"( avoir la ) Flemme" means kind of "( being ) lazy" but not in a negative way, it's almost a noble feeling
I have yet to see a one-word English equivalent of the French word "rentrée", which means "going back" or "coming back", and is used for that time period where kids go back to school (and workers come back from their break)
Of course that is has a big impact in terms of society and economics
Feels like a word every language should have
We do this every time but I don't think we've a word for this
Same here, we have "la journée" (from sunrise to sunset) and "le jour" (24-hour day)
I love kombinować. In french we have the word "combine" translate to n°3
There is "si" in french that looks kinda similar, it can be used to reply as a "yes" after a "no", and can also be used as a "so" in "it is so good" - "c'est si bon"
Tu aurais du préciser que routine en francais et en anglais n'a pas le même sens
Les gens pourraient ne pas comprendre pourquoi tu n'arrives pas à le traduire correctement
We call that a meal
Meal is a whole thing here
When i went to england they ate in front of TV the barbares
Funny, for example
Marrant, drôle, cocasse, amusant, bizarre, comique, curieux, impayable, hilarant, rigolo, spirituel, etc: those all translate to "funny". But a "cocasse" thing is not exactly the same as a "drôle" thing -there’s a nuance in the _way_ it’s funny
Something "cocasse" is something that is funny because it is somewhat strange, while something "drôle" is just something that makes you laugh
I might just lack vocabulary in English, but I don’t know of words that would convey these nuances
I feel like the English nuances are more turned toward how much something makes you laugh (the difference between funny and hilarious for example; we have that too), not the reason why you laugh
I love German so much
You guys have such a rich and pertinent language, I don’t get why everyone is hating on it and I really miss speaking it
Yup
Some people even say "au jour d'aujourd'hui"
Keine hate
Nuch eine 'not useful thing'. Ich also miss Deutsch language
I know that
I just feel like we do not highlight the same nuances (as I said up there)
Some people say these are ugly
Mosaic walls and unusual windows
My least favorite building in France is the [Bibliothèque Nationale de France] (National French Library), or Bibliothèque François Mitterrand
It is everything a library shouldn't be: foreboding, intimidating, almost dystopian
When you walk in there you feel like you're going to prison
It's a great institution that provides a lot for academics, and in some ways it looks cool and all, but the architecture is all wrong for the building's actual purpose
Really makes you sympathize with the Corsican way to deal with this kind of things (a healthy dose of C4 before the buildings get inhabited)
We have [some of those (but worse)] in France too
It's like the quintessence of cheapo 90's architecture
Unpopular opinion: i like thé tour Montparnasse
Paris shouldn't be a museum city, time hasn't stopped in 1870
It's a welcome change in the cityscape and a rather impressive view when exiting la gare Montparnasse
With this mindset, we wouldn't have the Eiffel tower or le centre Pompidou (i love this building)
You're being harsh imo
The building isn't ugly in and on itself
It's more the difference with the rest of the neighborhood that shocks most of the time
I love this list
The way they carefully justify each choice is very German
Apparently, next year’s Rubik’s cube world championships are going to be in Almere (random fact)
> the
>Imec-Tower
just what is even going on there
But all houses do look the same in some parts of Belgium too
Well brutalisme is shite when you live in it, but as a distant piece of architecture it can look cool
Or as a university
Might be Stockholm syndrome but I appreciate an ugly brutalist university, as long as I don’t have to live in it
Feels like you can do anything with it, and if you burn it down by mistake it’s no biggie
>They had a great old building and they spend millions on putting a
>bathtub
> next to it
Lol, thanks for this wonderful and accurate description
That was Guy de Maupassant, IIRC
Mafia is generally alright with building projects actually since they mainly care about money
It led to them being at odds with FLNC at times
Well they teach us they exist, that's pretty much all
Teaching religion in public school is illegal in France, except in Alsace-Moselle, due to them being German when these laws about religion in school came out
A private school can still teach religion
In France, state and church are completely separated
The French constitution states in its very first article : "France is
a laical Republic
France respects all beliefs".
As a result, state schools absolutely do not teach religion, it is actually forbidden for both teachers and pupils to openly express their religious affiliation (for example, religious signs such as headscarves, crucifix necklaces or kippahs cannot be worn at school unless they can be hidden under clothing)
History classes may cover religious subjects but only ever in relation with historical events ( for exemple, the Saint Bartholomew day massacre was a violent clash between Catholics and Huguenots during the Renaissance)
Private schools on the other hand may offer religious studies
I only really know about Catholic private schools
The ones I know are very relaxed when it comes to religion and pupils do not actually have to be Catholic or to go to religious classes in order to attend
Some may be stricter, but for the majority of them, religion does not play a huge role in the teaching itself
I'm always a bit shocked when I hear my British friends talking about private schools in the UK
Some had to prove they were baptised and regularly going to Church
This sounds very alien to me
In the same way, I have seen pupils wearing religious clothing in British schools which was a bit strange at first
Yes, because our country is christian
But if you or your parents didn't want you to attend religion class that's fine
Instead you had morals class
It depends, in private schools they do sometimes
I think it's moslty an opt-in thing, but sometimes in very religious schools you don't get a choice
Well, it depends where you are and what kind of school you attend
Public schools in France don't have "Religion" as a subject, except in Alsace and Moselle as the law about the separation of the state and church was passed when it was a part of Germany (1905)
Otherwise private school often do that as they're very often linked with religions, almost exclusively catholicism
Yeah, it's only taught as part of History classes, as a culture aspect, not what they preach
As to why, separation of church and state is very important here
Of course that only refer to public school, some private ones might be more inclined to have religious education
But about 85% of children are in public schools
WTF, in what school where you‽ If a private Catholic school than yes, but don't go here telling people yes, when actually no
School with this kind of lesson are a minority
The actual answer would be:
No we don't have it except in private schools
And if you do have them in public school, you're either living in Alsace for the laws there are different, or it's an exception and your school decide to put this class as an option
Also our country *was* Christian
France is a laïc country for over a century now
I have never heard of something like this treaty
This kind of catholic schools are not that common though
Most don't have chapels on the grounds
They are mostly in big cities in very religious neighborhoods
The majority of catholic schools in the country are like public schools but with an opt-in religious course and some kind of celebration for christmas and easter ( as in you get chocolates and maybe go to church to see some people sing)
We still do learn about religions, but through the scope of history and geography classes
Not as a subject of its own
Unless you attend a private school but it still wouldn’t be mandatory
According to Fox News there are no go zones in Paris where shariah law is applied
And here I thought that money didn't really have an odour for the Swiss
Lyon : Already a big city, more central than Paris
Clermont-Ferrand : really central
Versailles ofc but only if we have a Capetian king back or a Bonaparte emperor again ( there are still heirs for both dynasties )
I just can't see a politican there
Belfast for the independantists I guess
Wouls feel weird honestly
Because of History, it feels like Greece's capital must be Athens or Sparta
Let's move it to Cayenne for the lolz
Ajaccio or Rennes for the sheer chaos it would cause
Lyon’s other name is “Capitale des Gaules”
Marseille would probably be a more fitting candidate than Clermont, Lyon ans Marseille battle for the second post populaires (Lyon in it's city is second, but Marseille in it's Urban Area is second, both behind Paris)
Plus Marseille is a major economic Center in France
Lille, one of the biggest french city, and no Parisians to be seen
Have you seen the face of the current Bonaparte heir
The Emperor of punchable faces
Dutch side go back to the Netherlands, French side annexed by France, everybody’s happy and we put an end to this failed experiment
Oh and Brussels become the official capital or Europe, and doesn’t belong to any country, just the European Union
TIL that Vienna and Bratislava are only 1h apart by car, I never imagined two capitals would be that close to their country's border
Too big of a city
Saint Pierre et Miquelon would be even crazier
Well, Marseille would be actually a good candidate
It's the second largest city in France in urban area, and one of the major economic centers, especially in Gas and Fuel
Or we could kidnap the pope for old time sake
I dont care about his faces, I care about personnalities, purpose of ruling and loyalty from the ruler to his own nation
Why is it not a good idea ? Most European countries work like this already
I'd rather have the capital remain in the EU to be honest
Clipperton, to finally assert our claim there !
I mean they all have decapitable heads anyway
That's the beauty of royals
You mean like an
European Union
Always those silly jokes
During the revolution like 90% of beheaded people were just peasants or random people suspected of « having sympathies » for the king, according to « La loi des suspects » ( 1793 ) but there are always some goofy people fetishising about beheading on those years
I feel like France is in charge in the UE's foreign affairs, like I feel we are alone with Greece against Erdogan, alone with Armenia against Erdogan and Azerbaijan, alone in our will to not be USA's puppet but overall the UE seems pretty hollow to me
We provide the nukes and manage the foreign affairs
I believe France to be one of the pillars of the EU
I have a double French/Polish nationality
Sometimes I feel like I'm not sure which country I should be rooting for
Tbh I didn't even know you were in the EU
Do you think you would get even more tourists if you were a part of Italy ? Serious question !
>we provide cheaper labour force
And that's a big problem, we call this social dumping in our country
I feel Greece is an important member of Europe, the influence of Greece over the continent is so fundamental
And we love you, I think that Europeans generally do not have anything bad to say about the Greeks, even if we collectively had to send a bit of money to you guys
Being from Marseille, Greece has a special place in my heart
We are a Greek city, our flag colors are the one of Greece
Not EU related but Portuguese immigration help rebuild our country after WW2 and for that we are grateful
Not everyone is though sadly
Being French, I have to say I like how Ireland is this pebble in British shoes
More seriously I admire how you finally could come together as a nation and leave violence behind to become this flourishing country you now are
Sosem lesz diktatúra
Also since Brexit we are the only UE member with nuclear power, a permanent membership of the security council, and a military force we are actually able to send somewhere else
You export truck drivers
It's a thing i guess
(sorry, outside of low income job, i don't really know either, do you have a hub like Estonia has with Tech ?)
From a strict European construction point of view, I feel relieved the UK is finally out of the EU
I believe the UK vision of the EU was nothing more than a business-level integration meanwhile, at least for the founding states, the EU is way more than economy
It is first of all peace and mutual cooperation
I think the island factor, as well as how the British see themselves as a global power, led to the misconception that the UK could eventually mold the EU to their views
Just look how the Brexit negotiations go, this sentiment that the UK can have the upper hand, that they are a negotiation force, how some believe the EU will suffer from the Brexit to a point of its desintegration, all this is preposterous and show how the negotiators have an inflated view of UKs supposed grandeur if not superiority
I genuinely love the British people, but you definitely have the worst political class
Well to be fair, the UK always was the kid alone at the back of the class
You didn't really fit in, maint due to the anti-EU sentiment
You weren't part of Schengen nor the Euro zone, and most of your contracts were with France or Germany
In the end, you were important for the other less integrated countries, but your economy is easily replaced by the emergenxe of Eastern Europe, and France's Nuclear Arsenal is the 3rd in the world, so we're still covered on that
Each country is important in their own place, but the UK always seemed like it was never there to me, hence is the most easily replacable
You are in without being in, you don't want the euro, you are out of Schengen zone
We Southerners are not that bad, you know
I have so much respect for Spain, how Spain became a true, strong, democracy in such a limited time
You guys have quite an difficult past of dictators, coups d'Etat, until quite recently
I love how your King, virtually raised by Franco, nonetheless instated a true democracy at Franco's death
You guys are important in Europe, and you are our gateway to Latin America
I feel like in diplomacy if you make no one angry it generally means you are doing nothing
It helps that Macron basically got elected on a « strong EU » platform as opposed to the fascist hag
Having a leader that basically got elected saying « I will do everything to make EU strong and relevant » really gives him a lot of political leeway to actually do stuff on the European level compared to someone who got elected on a EU sceptic platform and who therefore can’t be seen being too active at the European level without being seen as flip flopping
Ideally what would be great is if no one was anyone’s lackey
That’s what we should aspire as Europeans anyway
>and wasnt afraid to say no to the US
Because it's our son
Well, its not like you have much coice
Every other country is either "I don't want to get involved into global politics" or straight out "I don't like the Union"
If you don't like France's leadership, just take the head
Well, you have a Bourbon king after all
Oh I think I actually knew that at some point, I just forgot it
Norway is the only one that is not in the EU at all, right
This is the principle, but the problem has been identified, our parliament is working on a legislative arsenal to counteract these abuses
For example, in the coming years Polish or other detached workers may be refused in our country, because they are not subject to our work regulations
well, you got some money to compensate, no ? That what we have in France when a commune have anything with "nuclear" in the name
The commune is paid by the gov, of the case of "if" something bad happens
What is the general sentiment
Why are people rejecting a full integration
My feeling is that nordic countries don't really feel they are sharing the same history and cultural values than Europe
Is this word related to "Merkel" or not at all ? xd
Sweden litteraly joined EU to be part of a bigger, stronger entity
Yes France has more muscle, can you blame her for taking care of things within the EU because, apparently, no one is willing to ?
France has a particular historical relationship with Armenia
There is a huge armenian community in France and they are influencial enough to push their agenda
So on this very topic we need a counterbalance force within the EU to safeguard Macron's willingness to get involved
Ok, thanks
>If we wanted that we would've joined NATO,
Since when NATO did anything to diplomacy ?
You litteraly said it, you joined EU for Economy, social and culture
And guess what, its exactly what the EU uses !
Because the EU rely nearly solely on soft power, on being an economic power house, on being so diverse
On being the fucking grown up !
> and because of its foundational ideology of keeping the peace,
And what do you think France is trying to achieve by being world police ?
You think we're doing it because of self image problems ? Because we longed the Colonial days ?
Just because our country did some things bad don't mean we can't change and strive to be better, for ourselves and the world
Germany too did some horrible things ! Yet they don't get hit all the time about it
&#x200B;
> Can you blame the USA for Iraq and Afghanistan
Talk about a strawman
Because invading a country over falsified proof, and leading the EU's foreign relations is totaly the same thing
&#x200B;
All you just want is the return of the good old isolationism
Because you think you'll be spared if you don't try to do anything
Because putting your head in the sand is a "valid tactic"
If you wanted that, you joined the wrong Union
>FRANCE dictating EU's foreign policy without having been asked and without having explicit mandate for it
Exept France isn't saying "The EU this", or "The EU that"
France is talking about its own position,a nd tries to talk other EU members into adopting the same
Yes we ARE pressuring more than other, and i think its because Macron want a stronger EU, more "Federation like", rather than a loose bunch of country
> The EU is not your personal army
Go fight your own crusades and let the individual states make up their own minds
We didn't waited you to say that
We've been busy fighting since early 2020 agaisnt terrorism in Africa
Who joined us ? No fucking one
We're supporting Greece, who joined us ? ONLY ITALY
> Germany prefers to err on the side of caution, but they're not passive
Germany err to the sive of being passive
Else they would actually try to do something other than being a starfish
Turkey is menacing greece, a country milked by germany, and germany say nothing
Sub-saharian africa is beging for help agaisnt terrorist, and germany, the second military in this god damned union is doing nothing
Both are threats agaisnt us
One is directly toward a member
Don't tell me germany is "cautious" when their position is to say "pls don't fight".
&#x200B;
Yes France has taken the head of the Foreign Diplomacy, because its the best suited for
Yes we often talk for the Eu, again because we are the one with the stronger "punch". But what tells you we are not "mandated" by YOUR government about this
Do you really think the members would just "let France because a Diplomatic dictator" without doing anything ?
You say "Democracy", but last i checked, there are ministers that are trusted with special issues
Like a Foreign affairs minister
France has this role
Depends highly on the country
In France I don’t see any big downside honestly
We have various apps allowing you to get treated by a doctor fast enough and we have a card (called carte vitale) which looks like a credit card, you give it to the doctor and it allows the administration to reimburse you very fast for what you pay without paperwork
The organism in charge of healthcare costs, pensions, etc
is in debt
Has been for quite some times, I believe
It’s a rather big part of our national debt (10,5% in 2015)
Hopefully someone who understands how the Sécurité Sociale works better than I do will chime in
Edit: as others said for their own country, healthcare is not actually free
We pay for it by other means
But I don’t believe that’s a downside, as it’s the very basis of the system -it’s just the way it works
Plus, the logic behind it is that we help each others in times of need
Sure, I usually don’t go to the doctor, and pay for more than I use
But the day my sister broke both her legs, my family was not the one paying for her hospitalization: that was French society at large, in a (roughly put) way
Some people abuse of it, my father was a nurse in an emergency room, many people came for not much (like a small wart or a cold), so the emergency rooms was crowded and those people wanted to see a doctor before others (with important injuries) and would get violent and insult them all day long when they said "no". They did it so they won't have to pay for those small medication in a pharmacy or to avoid paying the doctor (even if they get their money back after)
The only way to calm them was to call the police or sometime hi black colleagues would say something like "why are you yelling, it's because I'm black isn't it
", this would calm them down since they didn't want to look racist
Waiting time can be long, but it depend of when you come, I went to the pediatrics emergency room twice for my son, the first time I waited about 30min, the second time about 1h30
I went with my (adult) cousin to the ER once for a broken leg, she waited about 3 hours but it can be much more sometime
(they receive you as soon as you arrive and then you wait for the doctor/nurse,  so if you have sometime very dangerous/important you go first, if not you wait
I see a lot of comments about waiting time, but we don’t have that problem in France so really, I can’t think of any downside
\- It is pretty expensive if you don't actually have necessity to use it, but I see it as a guaranteed by state investment for when I'll get older, like our retirement system
\- Numbers of new accepted doctor students are regulated by the government (at least in France, it's called a numerus clausus), and these numbers are very low
So there is a very long waiting line to get to some specialist (most notably eye doctors, even dentists if you're not already a patient)
Also those who have the best grade get to chose their specialty, so worst doctors are often where there is little money to make (geriatrics, emergency
Aside from the healthcare system, hospitals get less and less credits
It leads to doctors and nurses getting overworked and fleeing to private institutions
Where I live, they opened a private clinic about 15 years ago in the suburbs of my little city that had an agreement to unload some weight on the saturated hospital in city-centre (notably emergencies and some little standard procedures)
But considering some of the acts don't make money, or little, well they don't. The hospital was old so it's been rebuilt at the same place, so with no possibility to expand, taking into account that some of the load would be lifted which is not
So we have an hospital still overcrowded and a private clinic you can use but with an abusive mark up
This private clinic had a very nice reputation upon opening (because accessing to the hospital in the city center was horrible if you're from outside) but people start to realise they are just as greedy as you can get
That is something that is becoming really more and more common in France these days, and I'm afraid our current system won't be sustainable for long
>The only downside I see are waiting times (when it comes to surgeries) when you have a disease that is not severe
You can be waiting for weeks or months
Sure, but it makes perfect sense: if I need my tonsils removed, and another guy comes in with a bullet in his stomach, yeah, take care of him first
I see that as paying for the privilege to live in a society where people don’t die of untreated curable diseases in the street
That depends, for example I had a quick panic attack (involving chest pain) last year that only lasted 30 minutes and the man on the phone still sent an ambulance that brought me to the hospital just to make sure there was nothing serious even though my vital signs were good on the electrocardiogram they did at my home
I think even if it is not an immediate emergency they don't joke with things like chest pain, better safe than sorry with lots of expenses later
Everything was free for me
I’m not sure it has anything to do with free healthcare though as we do also have private hospitals
In my case I think heart attack was out of the question with the electrocardiogram but I'm so sorry for your loss
No one should experience that
English
I mean, it's just such a big melting pot of so many different languages - mostly German, French, Norske
- that the same few letters can be pronounced basically anything
Also there's so many words that comes from Roman languages but they completely changed the meaning of them, so when you learn English you're like "Oh I know what *Actually* means, it's like *Actuellement* in French
" but no
Why did they decided to change the meaning
Mystery
Does their new meaning make sense regarding the etymology of the word
not at all
Hungarian and Finnish seem to be the "strangest" languages in Europe
None who are you to tell if a language makes sense or not ? A language is the reflection of a culture
I think Dutch is strange to read: double e, double o, k's all around
we say four twenty ten nine
> Its flow of speech is the same as spanish, it uses same phonemes as spanish
On the Spanish side of the border
On the French side it's more like Gascon
>  Also they’ll still look down on you because you’re not actually French
r/thatHappened
I doubt it's nearly as underrated as 9/10th of the Romance languages people aren't even aware exist
God my brain has to work to hard to understand any of it
I think I know the basics of the Spanish civil war, it was taught in school when I grew up
What I know little about is the 30 years war which ended with the treaty of Westphalia, which shaped a lot of modern Europe
Also, I happen to know a lot about the Franco-Prussian war, but it's something which has gone forgotten from mainstream history knowledge, while it's the precursor and the root cause of WW1 and WW2
- Everything Eastern Europe between the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and WW1
It seems like a very crazy affair
Living in Alsace, I'm amazed that some Swedish army came down over here to fuck things up during that time
School start at 7:55
Periods are 55 minutes long, I have one break in the morning that last 15 minutes at 9:45 (We don't have time between classes lol, not even 5 minutes)
I have 55 minutes to eat, at 11:55
Then I have another break at 15:30 which also lasts 15 minutes
I finish school at 5:35
(17h35)
In primary school we started at 8am and finished a 4:30pm
Middle school and high school were pretty much the same starting at 8am and finishing at 5pm
Yeah this is a pretty long day if I look at the other answers on this post
We had like 2 hours for lunch from 12 to 2pm
In all 3, we had Wednesday afternoon free
I'm currently studying Computer science, not in university but in an IUT (Universiterian institute of technology) and my days are more or less 8am to 6pm every day
Your days are so short
I'm so jealous
Oh yeah I'm a dumbass, thanks for pointing it out
Yeah my younger self is jealous about your younger self hahaha
At one point in french History, a monarch could have regain the throne, but he declined because they would'nt change the blue/white/red flag to a full white one
The french monarchists lose their last chance of getting into power because of the color of a fucking flag XD
One time in 16th century Strasbourg, hundreds of people danced non-stop for days and wouldn't stop for any reason
This was the [Dancing Plague of 1518

The First Communist Revolution acrually happened in France during the Paris Commune event, un 1870
Unsuccessful, because the Newly formed Third Republic AND the Prussians kept the siege of Paris going to end the rebellion
The communist Red Flag was also inventes in France during the first Socialist uprisings in 1848, used previously as a symbol to the masses to disperse before the guards start shooting during a protest, it was transformed Into a symbol of Socialist demands and revolts
The French beheading the French king during the French revolution
Some guys did that with a lama here
They stole the thing from a zoo, called it Serge, and took it for a tour in the tramway
The name Serge is a reference to a French singer, Serge Lama
That reminds me of that US intern terrorist attack with the [killdozer]
This sounds so British haha
So did the French, an event called the Saint Barthelemy
Is there a Frencher name than “Jean-Charles Pichegru”, I wonder
3000 French-African cavalry in WW1 pierced the frontline from Macedonia to the Danube river in Hungary, 800 kilometers north from here
Cut from the supply and communication lines they captured Uskub (now Skopje) defended by 50000 men, causing Bulgaria to demand armistice, and the retreat to Hungary of the 11th german army
Which was cut in their retreat by the same cavalry and surrendered
They pursued their advance in spite of the austrian armies and reach the Danube where they waited for their army to join them
They progressed so fast the rest of their expedition force (French, Serb, Greek, British, Italian) took 22 days to catch up with them
The war had been over for 4 days at this point
They had no way to know
Since they were fighting on the "minor" eastern front and on "outdated" horseback they got little recognition back home, despite having a major role in the end of WW1 (major contribution in taking out an Axis member, a German army and was a pain in Austria's butt, singlehandedly)
General Jouinot-Gambetta who commanded that cavalry,  would write a book about them
"Uskub or the role of the african cavalry in the Victory". But even with Prime Minister and worst Nobel Prize winner ever Aristide Brilland would wrote the preface for the book they're still fuckin unknown
Overall the role of the entire eastern front in the end of the war is terribly overlooked
I answered that to another comment
I was a reference to what [Louis Bonaparte] said when his brother (Napoléon Bonaparte) gave him the title of "king of holland". The guy tried to learn a bit of dutch, but he mispronounced konig
We have this verb as well and actually it's mostly used about criminality when someone push someone through a window
Fun fact: it depends on your language
We had a Math teacher exactly like the one you described
I still remember her name, she was Mrs
Green
She was a good woman
I was gutted when I heard that she’d succumbed to COVID
This was May-June of last year
She was the reason Math was my favourite subject in 8th grade
Quite ironic that a country that beheaded its nobelty and king created a monarchy not even 20 years after the revolution
It would be Bastille Day for me
There's just a nice feeling of national unity, it's summertime, the parade is always a treat to watch, the firefighters organize bals at their stations and there are fireworks everywhere
In 2018, we won the World Cup the day right after Bastille Day, so it was an incredible two days
For me it's May 1st (workers day)
It's the only holiday where really *only* essential services (like hospitals) are allowed to stay open
In almost every city,  public transport is stopped (national railway and airports still works, and public transport in Paris, but that's all)
There are protests organized by unions but they are usually in a very friendly and nice atmosphere
Tradition is to offer *muguet* ([lily-of-the-valley] on that day, so the only "stores" opened are people selling it in the street
Anyone can do that, you don't need any permit to sell *muguet* on may 1st
I just really like it, the flowers, the quiet since everything is closed
It's relaxing
Christmas for me, there is an overall chill and relax mood that I love, it's snowy, with christmas decoration everywhere
When it's over and January starts that's so depressing
I'm usually not a big barbecue guy but that looks fucking amazing
Same
And it goes with the beginning of the summer holidays for many of us, which often enough gives it the “summer feels”.
They do celebrate it
It’s a national celebration, I believe they _have_ to celebrate it, and even if it were not mandatory I doubt they’d let go of a national holiday, the fireworks, etc that go with it
Yes it is :) the whole country is united in that regard now, its been a long time since the revolution and the government has always been very good at repressing regional differences
But anyway, regardless of the reasons, it's celebrated there like anywhere else
I'm not aware of anything like this
I'm positive they get a national holyday like the rest of the country, and I'm sure most people do celebrate it
The uprisings are water under the bridge, and tho it's still a catholic bastion, I'm pretty sure actual royalists are, like everywhere else, regarded as marginals
It kinda depends here in France
It's often the 24th in the evening and we call it "réveillon de Noël", "Christmas Eve" literarily
But also a lot of people do it on the 25th too
When I was a kid we had this big celebration and dinner with family on Christmas Eve, and then we went to bed and in the morning we would open the presents
Now that there are no kids anymore, we celebrate and have dinner on the 25th
But I know it's a real debate among some folks whether you should open presents the 24th at night or the 25 !
Merry Christmas and happy holiday everybody !
It's funny seeing people fighting a out whether it's the 24th or the 25th, in my family it's always been both
A great diner the 24th, we open our gifts either at midnight or in the morning
Then we go at it again the 25th with more food
We did both
Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve, then on the morning of the 25th we'll get our gifts and have a Christmas lunch, often with other family members
> But I know it's a real debate among some folks whether you should open presents the 24th at night or the 25 !
We'll all you have to do is wait for midnight to open your present and you technically open them the 25th
That's what we do in my family when we're impatient
Wait, doesn't everybody have a feast on both days
Christmas Eve dinner with presents (we do presents during l'apéritif) , some go to mass at midnight
on the 25th you have mass in the morning (if you're religious of course) and after another Christmas lunch that ends around 3 or 4 pm (la sobremesa for our Spanish friends)
Vannak-e emberek, akik December 23-án este ünnepelnek valamit
I think I did that on some years too actually !
It was like the continuity of what happened the night before, it was pretty cool
I think most my friend did this !
It's technically the 25th, but it's not morning I guess ? It didn't fit the trope of Santa bringing gift in the night while you slept
Depends I guess ?
I know we used to have dinner at night, and lunch on the 25th most of the time
But when you have a big family and you have to go to one side of the family then the other it's complicated !
To me presents during apéritif or lunch always felt super early ahah
Well, in my case, while we were young and still believed in Santa we waited til morning, but since now both my sister and I are adults we just open them after midnight, this way we keep the 25th thing and we just cheat morning for a few hours :')
Köszönöm, nagyon érdekel a kultúrátok ^ ^
Hát akkor nem értem hogy miért láttam ilyen sok ajándékok fotóját tegnap este
Ahah i definitely get you ! I did this for a several years, and weirdly went back to 25th in the morning two years ago !
I definitely see the perks of waiting until morning
There's something whimsical about it, like a fairy tale
Plus everything's better when you've waited for it
I guess I'm just too impatient
Plus it's not only up to me
Lehet, hogy én vagyok ^ ^

Can’t find more French looking man !
If I meet [this guy] in the street, I am 92% sure he is french
Half the "distinctively [insert nationality]" that I’ve seen here could have been French to me
I might be super bad at facial recognition, but I think it also has got to do with the fact that a "facial nationality" is not really _that_ much of a thing (not saying distinct features do not exist, just that we’ve shared much of those over time)
If I did that I'd be aaccused of racism
That's how crazy it is nowadays
When in Paris, you guys are less loud than Italians in the transports ! Except if it’s a group of students hahaha (but it’s cool they always look fucking happy, it’s really nice to see)
I can relate to this
Though many would think Middle Easterners or Arabs would look the same, I somehow pick up on subtle features to identify a Lebanese, Syrian, Turk or Persian
I am originally Lebanese
Not really common but totally French, you’re right !
A spanish guy would be more tanned than him I think
But if I have to give an example, I think [Pierre Niney] looks very "french". I don't know why tho
I notices a lot of english guys wear tatoos in London
I don't know if it's just my impression or not tho
More of a wealthy parisian stereotype than a french one though
Oh my fucking god she’s a stereotype hahaha
I admit I use it for my legs at the beginning of summer, because they are too white otherwise compared to the rest of my body (I wear a lot of jeans/pants during spring)
&#x200B;
But never on my face/arms, it's too noticeable
I have to agree, they have a particular look ! I’m not the biggest fan because sometimes there’s a whole bunch looking a bit too similar but it’s still sophisticated, I agree
But I think you’ll find that funny : we have the same conversation about Londoners when in London with my friends haha
Idk what it is, it’s the leather shoes, the shirts, idk, but some of you guys have a rock but really smart and sophisticated heritage in the way you dress and we love that
Also : the suits
Man
The suits
It’s from protesting all the time
Definitely Paris, it got like 36M visitors last year which is better than 95% of other whole countries
Then there's Disneyland, the Alps and Pyrenees in Winter (but to be fair all of our mountain ranges are pretty nice, and in the one near where I live there was traffic jam for the first time at the summit of a station so it's regaining some interest) the Riviera in Summer, the Atlantic coast is also a good spot for surfing and swimming, Brittany, Normandy, Alsace and Corsica are some of the nicest and most visited regions, there's also the whole Southern half that is really interesting to see, and for overseas, Polynesia (mostly Tahiti), Guadeloupe and Martinique get rather few tourists compared to mainland regions but it's still not that bad, and are mostly visited by people from nearby countries and by the French themselves
L'ile de France, which is saturated with tourists everywhere in high season, and la côte d'azur, I'm not introducing it
Easily Paris
Many tourists who come to France only check out Paris
Well, if there's one thing France doesn't lack, it's tourists
France has very varied landscapes and meteorological conditions so tourists may go to different parts on the country depending on what they're after
Most international tourists go to the Côte d'Azur (Cannes, St Tropez, Nice) on the Mediterranean coast during the summer or to the Alps (Courchevel, Megève, Arc 2000) for skiing in the winter and of course Paris which is the most visited city in France by far
Foreigners also go to French overseas regions (Bora Bora, Tahiti, St Bart), especially on their honeymoons
French people may go to less famous locations such as Normandie (Deauville, Trouville) and Bretagne ( Belle-île en mer, St Malo, Douarnenez) on the western coast during the summer or to the Pyrénées mountains in the winter
&#x200B;
Personally, I would recommend less crowded regions such as Alsace, the Loire castles and the Auvergne mountains
I also happen to really like the northern coast (Boulogne sur Mer, Le Touquet) which is very scenic although the water is a bit colder
If you put Paris and French Riviera aside, i'd say Mont-Saint-Michel is the place
Paris all year long
Mediterranean coast in summer
Biggest worldwide ski resorts in winter
Also between Marseille and Nice/Monaco (Provence in general) there are a lot of tourists
I was one of them in Provence a few weeks ago and everywhere (Marseille, Cassis, Aix, Avignon, Nice) has a lot of tourists
It would almost be shorter to list areas that *don't* get a fuckton of tourists
You just wrote the composition of France !
Saw lots of "local" tourists in southern Brittany last week
Beyond that, lots of Germans and way more Americans than I'd thought there'd be, what with the travel restrictions and all
Toute l'île de France ? Je suis pas sur que la Seine-Saint-Denis soit un haut lieu touristique
I honestly hesitated with the Mont Saint-Michel
Both the Mont and Île de France are touristy, but at least there’s more to the second one than just tourism
Not sure there is much life in the Mont itself
Yeah that's what I told (Riviera is the English word for Côte d'Azur)
La Lozère et le Limousin mdr
Comment tu fait CDG -> Paris
Via notre bien aimé RER B :)
Provence is not a part of Riviera
Je prends l'avion à Luxembourg quand je vais à l'étranger ;)
It’s past of the PACA region
[Toujours notre bien aimé RER B donc
I know, I grew up there
It's Provence, Alpes & Côte d'Azur
It doesn't mean one is part of the other
Je pars pas de Strasbourg hein et de toute façon je dois prendre le train 3 fois par an
I would say most knows every or almost every state by names but wouldn't be able to tell the list
Like they would be "Oregon
Yes it's a state" but wouldn't be able to say all of them by earth
Most probably knows where are precisly 3 or 4 max on a map and maybe a bit more if they are est or west, hot or cold etc
Most won't know their capital but knows the city itself
People will have heard of most of them, and can probably name some locations or stereotypes but don't expect them to know much more
Especially if you're not from one of the most famous ones (Florida, California, Alaska, Hawaii, New York, Texas)
The rest is pretty much considered interchangeable and the majority couldn't place them on a map
I would not be capable to recite the 50 states, probably 20 or 30
I would be able to acurately place on a map maybe a dozen
As State capitals, that is another level
people would know the names, but wouldn't really know where they are or what they're like (with the exception of New York, Texas, California and maybe Hawaii)
In High School geography class, I had to learn them all and place them on a map, but 20 years later I can only do it for half of them at the most
Not sure if they could place them, but most people are familiar with some of them: Texas, Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Florida
Easy to identify
If you give a state name, probably could easily tell it's a US state
But could never name most of them, or point them on a map outside of the well known ones (Texas, California, Florida
And it takes it name from a fairly big city in southern France, but misspelled for some reason (two Ls in the French city)
Got 48 of them in 2min30, and spent 5 minutes staring blankly at Iowa and Mississippi
Not going to let that stop me from being proud to name all of New England
And even then, I'd feel like the person assumes I'm not aware of the existence of Georgia the state
And tbh, I think it'd be pretty rare that someone from Georgia, US is mistaken from a native of Georgia the country
And some cities
Like Paris, Texas
Not really, except maybe those from Bretagne, Corse or Alsace ... for exemple because they have a strong local identity
Most people just say they are from a city or "near that city".
Most of the time Regions are just like an administration thing, not an identity/culture stuff, for exemple I'm from Auvergne-Rhônes-Alpes région
But people from Auverge have a different identity than those from the Alpes for exemple, the old patois is different, culture too etc
It's too big for us (even if they are small compared to US states)
We would rather say I'm from "this department". My region have 12 departements and those departement often have a"friendly" rivalty between each others
Departement were not originally a "cultural" or "historical" area with a local identity, they were made so a man on a horse would be able to go from the main town to the borders of it in one day ride
So some can have weird forms depending of mountains, rivers etc
and then changed to fit some practicle purpose
That is a nice story, thanks for sharing it
I saw a comment by a Polish who put a sentence on what only comas mattered
So here is one in french but I think that this is the same in english but this is all I have to offer :
"C'est l'heure de manger, les enfants !" =   Time to eat, children !
"C'est l'heure de manger les enfants !" = Time to eat the kids !
je me tut (I stop talking)
je me tue ( I kill myself)
The German exchange students taught me this during one of my German trips in school, was a delight to use on my essays lol
Me too
Sorry because this is all what I have to "offer".
Jag tallar inte swenska
Trust me, it's difficult even for us
I Know\^\^
And in reverse, when I'm talking  english it's really frustating because of the "lack" of choice, especially to for description
For a good things it's almost always great, amazing, good or awesome
We have a lots of adjectives that mean almost the same but not exactly the same while english language have only one or too so I never manage to express what I really mean
But I still love english
French has been used as the lingua franca for this reason
Subtle nuances helps when dealing with diplomacy
Most of the French comments I’ve read her said no
And I couldn’t disagree more
Being french means being European
We have to be involved in the future of the continent because, in the end, we’re just a bunch of small states
If we would fight economically alone against the US, Canada or China, we would already have been eaten !
We made war to each other for literally centuries before realizing that we can grow so much bigger and faster if we do it together
Europe, the European Union, the monetary union, all have a lot of flaws, I couldn’t agree more
But it’s such a gift
It was offered to us by people who actually lived the war in Europe, got their loved ones killed by it, by the neighbors
So, if they thought that becoming allies with said neighbors was the best thing to do, who are we, their spoiled children living in the XXIst century to deny this heritage ?
I'm glad to live in France, don't really care about the EU
Hell yes !!
Holy fuck yes
f r e e h e a l t h c a r e w a v e
Not at all, I like the idea but what it became is just awful
Euro is horrible, the way eu works without democracy and with awful lobbying is horrible, and imposing the exact same policy to 26 totally different states is totally horrible and antidemocratic
Absolutly no
I envy brits so much
Sounds up my view too
The EU is not perfect but it's pretty damn good
My opinion exactly, considering 80 years ago we were engulfed in complete war, the fact that the European Union exists is truly amazing, and I am so grateful for everything the union has done for Europe
Your feelings do not match reality
Can we swap ?
[Pourtant il faudrait
Hahahaha j'apprécie la fin de l'article
>Les auteurs de l'étude jugent que « des réformes structurelles sont nécessaires maintenant
Pour profiter de l'euro, la France doit suivre avec rigueur la voie de la réforme du président Macron ».
Plutôt sortir de l'EU que de suivre les réformes libérales """"""nécessaires""""""" de Macron
Yeah, most people here are really apathetic towards the EU (at least that's how I feel it), literally no feeling whatsoever, except when I can blame them for something, and I'm like that too
Wouldn't surprise me if we end up trying to leave eventually
Chacun juge des conclusions à tirer de cette étude
J'ai bien compris que t'aimais pas l'EU, je suis pas fan non plus, c'est juste que je suis un peu comme la plupart des Français, un peu apathique par rapport à l'EU, je m'en fous un peu de ce qu'ils font là bas
Fun fact
I've studied a fair bit of Irish in my home country before going for my Erasmus year in Ireland - Dublin, specifically
While I was aware of the situation, I did try my hand at basic stuff to start conversations and legit could not get a reply out of most people
I basically lived a limited (and self-aware) version of [Yu Ming is aimn dom] a short film about a Chinese kid who picks a new country to live in at random, lands on Ireland, and naturally decides to learn the language - Irish
He flies into Dublin, hilarity ensues
So like do you go "what's the scéal" or straight up "cad é an scéal"?
Ok one question that's always been bugging me is "taoiseach". I always heard it as "tee-shack". Can you confirm that I'm not insane and it should have a /x/ as final consonant, and that the entirety of the Irish media system (bar TG4) can't be arsed to pronounce it right
In France, we had the strikes with the "gilets jaunes" (yellow vests)
When we had terrorist attacks in Strasbourg, the gilets jaunes started believing and spreading the rumor that the government was behind this attack, and they did so to drag the attention somewhere else and make the population forget about them
The gilets jaunes (not all of course), truely believed that
The worst part is that they are so stubborn they forget that french civilians died this day, and all they thought about was their strike !
I had a friend who believed people on the government, and the rich generally speaking, were all part of pedophile, child-sacrificing rings
Frankly after the Epstein case, I'm tempted to believe he was at least partially right
Why do you think the tunnel was empty
Our government was in it the whole time
like sovereign citizens
It's not bad, I usually search the French one at first, and then look at the English version to see if there is more information
(Sometimes our version is even the more detailed one)
Lots of pages are direct translation from the English version
I generally use Wikipedia in French but when I read an article that seems to lack of details I take a look at the English or Spanish article
When it comes to chemistry I use it very rarely, English Wikipedia is way more complete
I use French Wikipedia for locally relevant topics, English Wikipedia for other topics
French Wikipedia is smaller and there's not as much quality control for this same reason
Some topics are subject to pseudoscientific content, and as an occasional editor, it's frustrating to see the number of affected pages, and vandalized pages as well
I almost exclusively use the french wikipedia
Only some very niche english topics that we don't know about in France aren't translated
Never use Wikipedia in another language if the article exists in French, it's often very well detailed
Cebuano wikipedia being autogenerated is so cool !
Sure
And I live near Vittel which is a pretty famous water brand so I have the same water quality as bottled water but without paying anything
It's also free in the restaurants, bars etc
Yes, some people prefer drinking bottled water though
Same in France
It's in fact illegal for a restaurant to make you pay for tap water
I almost never see people drinking bottled water though
Cold as fuck mountain water from a source is a godsend though while hiking
That is very cool
French system to enter med school is chaotic, but at the same time we lack doctors
They said they changed it, but in fact they just improved the reorientation after failing the "Concours".
I live in a part of France called "la diagonale du vide" (The empty stripe)
It roughly goes from the NorthEast of France to the West/South; this shape / . The population is decreasing in most cities and villages, and since there's not enough attractiveness/population there are no big universities or lots of job opportunities
My city has a nice history centre, and one of the universities here is starting to become more and more known, so I think it will become a student town eventually
There's no textile industry, or industry at all (except for small shops who do stuff themselves)
It's kind of depressing to think that I'll have to leave where I lived all my life to go to university and have a job in the field I want cause if I don't I'll get stuck
We're famous for our melons but most of the melons are not from this city
Propaganda from "non-political" group is getting out of hand
I suppose it's the same problem everywhere, ultra-anti-nuclear association pass false information on the subject everyday, animal right societies are backed by huge companies producing vegan meat
Today a high ranked member of a syndicate is more powerful than a elected parlementarian
I learned that for 50 years we had this :  which limit the number of medical student we can have each year
It's been removed last year
Today’s Europe is not yesterday’s Europe
And today’s Africa is not yesterday’s Africa
Things have changed dramatically and people are still stereotyping countries based on what they have heard long time ago
Where are you from ?
If you only know Paris, you might think that
but come to the south of France, then back to Paris, you'll see the Parisian-vibe is pure stress, hurry and sulking
I totally agree
I've lived all my life in the same place and people make me feel like a complete stranger
I travelled to many places and sometimes I had a bad experience, but most times I met wonderful people who gave my faith in humanity back
I believe there's a home somewhere for everyone who can afford moving there
Thank \*FUCK !
There it is
Finally ! I was disapointed not to read some Swedo-Danish wars in the comments so far !
There are only 4 cities in this list I've never heard of, 3 of them in Germany
They are:
- Bochum, Germany (364,628)
- Wuppertal, Germany (354,382)
- Bydgoszcz, Poland (346,739)
- Mannheim, Germany (309,370)
I've also never heard of Bielefeld, but it doesn't exist so it doesn't count
Bochum
I had never ever heard about this city before
Bachum
Litteraly never heard about it
But the population is by city limits so there are big cities that get far in the list
Bochum in Germany for me, although I know some Polish cities only by name and nothing else, like Lodz
As an aside I wanted to check which was the last city that I knew of on the list, but since Nantes is third from the end it was kinda moot, as I live fairly close to Nantes
Same for me
I think more people would recognize the name Stetin because of Churchill's iron curtain speech
As for Poznan, I am sorry, I only recognize the name because of the great duchy of Posen :(.
Bydgoszc
Never heard of it
The first rule of /r/europe is that Europe doesn't have an east side, only west and central
mhhh i would say that you should learn primarily vocabulary cause even though the grammar and the verb conjugating are wrong, it doesn’t matter because we will understand you and correct you
for the method, i would say don’t try to translate it (or just at the beginning to have the bases), try to learn as a baby learn to speak, by understanding the meanings of the words, but also their subtleties
also don’t learn only by hearing, you have to have a written support cause French is a written language and it’s necessary to understand the structure of a sentences because it’s peculiar
also, don’t put yourself to much pressure if you do some mistakes, even us can’t speak perfectly ahah
French often translates as the long + old english
english: "guess i'll eat mutton"
french: "je pense que je vais prendre le mouton" (i think that i will pick the mutton)
Don't feel bad if you can't write properly a word, or don't know how to perfectly conjugate a verb
It takes time, because French grammar is a nightmare
Learn how to pronounce stuff correctly, that's all you need to sound like a native
You just need time and patience and don’t force yourself into the grammar
Agreed neglecting the writings part would be a mistake: we accept more the speaking mistake than the written ones
Overall it's easier if you're a native Latin language speaker
Reading is probably a good idea to remember all the spelling
Spelling is the worst part, even for French people
also, I was talking to a friend of mine who is American and she told me that she was struggling to understand when French people are speaking French because she couldn’t distinguish the words since we talk fast and on a single « note », so learning by seeing the « cutting » of the words in a sentence will surely help when youhearasentencesaidlikethat
yes we do ! it’s called « une anagramme ». it can be done with a word or a sentence
it was not about spelling but it was understanding the cut of words when she would here a person talking
Like for example if I would say « Aujourd’hui j’ai été à la boulangerie » she would hear « Aujourdhuijaiétéàlaboulangerie ». so she wouldn’t understand what i was saying because she couldn’t understand each word
but when i was talking slower, she would understand
about French spelling, I wouldn’t say it’s that easy because there are a lot of different combinations for the same sound (é, ai, ait, ais, haie, est, è, ê, et
), verbs are faaaaaar from easy, even for us, there are also silent letters, exceptions
that’s why i recommend for someone who wants to learn French to start with writing and then pronouncing
but maybe you’re just natural :)
well the concept is not complicated
you take a word for example, and with the same letters that compose that word, you create another word
it’s not used everyday of course
it’s more like a sort of game
here’s an example from wikipedia: Le Marquis de Sade = Démasqua le désir = Marque des ladies
you see you have the exact same letters in every « sentence ». also you can use every letters as much as you want
well it’s always easier to learn a language when you are younger
and about the Nouvel Obs, sometimes even us look at verbs, they are so complicated
about the instagram page, the spelling is absolutely awful but it’s because it’s ironic, misspelled on purpose, don’t worry :)
in general i would say that we spell simpler on purpose (clearly not as much as in the instagram page, and not this way) on the internet with abbreviations etc
, and there’re also new words coming from English and Arabic languages mostly, or just made up, only used by younger generations
but in school professors tend to be severe on spelling (not only French teachers) for us not to write like that in the « real life » because misspelling is really not well seen in France and it can be disabling, even though we all know how hard our language is
well actually, even though it can be quite annoying sometimes, i think it’s necessary
we have a beautiful language so why ruining it ? :)
when you say all europeans then i guess you are talking about the citizens and not the governments in place
So here is my list (of course counter exemples can always be found):
* willing to keep our country specificities but be part of a federation
* Human right and democracy as a guiding principle
* Respect to the Occidental museum that Europe is
* willing to group to not let US/China/Russia rule the world without counterbalance
* FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Getting offended when someone from the US says he would love to go to Europe as if it was a country but also like to say they would love to go to Asia/Africa/America
Overall, nothing
There's nothing common enough in our culture, our language, our history to efficiently federate people
^(Not that history would be enough anyways
Come on, it's cheating to use the Balkans
Well, Denmark is notoriously bullish on European federalism
That being said, you're correct that it is a minority view, but certainly not one that is exclusive to the Internet
In fact, it's been present since the very start of the EEC
truth is that they will do as they want on the international scene ... we are diplomats and they don't care for diplomacy anymore
But in the long term, more countries will join our boat (the way we think, not joining EU) and hopefully this will pay off ... but before there will be more invasion/drama/stupidity making the news
What are some sentences every mothers from your country say
In France:
\- If you forgot to turn the light off: "It's not Versaille here
\- If you're hungry: "eat your hand, save the other one for tomorrow"
\- When you forgot to say please "what about the magical word
\- "Eat your carrots, it will make you amiable (variant : it will make your bottom pink)
\- If you pick your nose "do you want my finger
\- When you  yawn  "close your mouth, you'll eat a fly"
\- When you're uptset: "Cry, you will pee less".
"Tu veux mes doigts

I’ve never check so this might just be a legend, but
In France you can’t name a pig Napoleon
Because of the emperor
In France, it's forbidden to name your pig "Napoléon" and it's mandatory to have a haystack in your garden in case the king comes in your street with his horses
No, this law has never been abrogated
Hi, France here
And we can't name a pig Napoleon, so yeah
In France , it is forbidden to name your pig "Napoleon".
In France, alcohol isn't allowed at work, except wine, cider, beer, and perry (pear cider with very few producers)
The weird things are that wine, beer and cider represent like 80% of alcohol consumption here, and that perry is produced by a couple of cider producers
So idk how it was added to the law
Women forbidden to wear trousers until very recently
It is a law from the Code Civil written under the ruling of Napoléon 1st
Therefore, it is outdated and certainly not applied but true
In the same code was the law forbidding women to wear anything else than a dress
I don't remember if this one is still in the law or has been ditched recently
C'est pas une légende il me semble
In Animal Farm, I believe that the pig is thus named "César" (Caesar) for this exact reason
Edit: Not 1984
>It is legal to cook dogs for private consumption
I understand now why you have so many Chinese tourists
We have the same in France, it's about 125 euros a year and you have to pay it as long as you have a TV screen in the house
They talked about changing it to any screen as some people would buy a huge computer screen and use them as TV to avoid the tax
I was super happy about such a tax for the same reasons many people in other countries are (free medias not controlled by the government, much more intellectual programs than on private channels etc
However, I feel like French public TV has become part of the government propaganda agenda and is not as free as they used to be
Which makes me angry to pay for a government's propaganda I don't support
Anyway, when this works correctly, 125euros a year is not a high price to pay for free media
Mon oncle a essayé une fois

It was only in Paris, and it was abrogated in 2013
J'ai plus vu de jupe depuis un bail donc je pense que t'es pas trop d'actualité et hors-sujet cher ami
IIRC it was ditched one or two years ago
And it just forbid them to wear pants without authorization from their husband or father if unmarried
I has been officially ditched in 2013, but was no longer unforced before that
Also, it accepted exceptions
Tant mieux, c’en est encore plus drôle !
We flew a kite in a public place
French is a nightmare for that
Vert = green
Vers = near/close to   or verse poem
Verre = glass
Ver =  worm
All are got the same pronounciation
Most of words in french arn't exactly pronounce like they are writen if your not familiar with the writing (like the rule ai is prononuce è), or can mean differents things if you still pronounce it the same but change the spelling
We got a lot of silence letters also
also for exemple the sound "ssss" ca be writen  "ss" or "ç", "c"or "t" depending of the word, it's like this for many sound: The sound "ey" can be writen "ai", "è", "et" or  "ei".
No, because we have multiple ways of writing the same sound
*O*, *au*, *eau* for example
There are still a few rules (for example very low probability of seeing a word end by "o", it's almost always "au" and "eau"), and you can often guess based on other words with similar roots, but it's not always the case :
Gold is *or*, but gold mining is "exploitation *aur*ifère", both words come from latin *aurum* but somehow one ended up with *o* and the other with *au*.
Lots of spellings are just arbitrary lile that
Basically, if you know the rules you can pronounce any word you read, but you can't write any word you hear
French words are pronounced as they are written, it's just that there are 4 million ways to spell the same sound
But any of those 4 million ways is pronounced the same, so there's that
Yeah but I mean, if you're not bad in French you remember perfectly how 99% of the words are written even with all our silent letters
Also s'en sent sans cent
French has arcane rules, but at least it has them, unlike some pseudo-Germanic languages I can think of
The answer to the question the OP is asking is yes, for me, as long as it's not a proper noun
Cause those are truly crazy - de Broglie comes to mind
God I wish that were me
English native but lived most of my life in France
The reason it’s consistent is because at some point in history France got really fed up with the fact that everybody spoke/wrote how they wanted so they introduced the “Académie Française” which standardised the language
So it’s an odd language which has a bunch of weird quirks dating from the 17th century but at least it’s remained consistent since then
English on the other hand is constantly evolving but is simpler
Don't forget "aient"
Stupid old anglais
Ez, er and é soud the same but are different from aiz and ait, onlyh people from the south because of their accent and some from the far north pronounce it the same way
that's the point, you need to learn the rules
Don't worry, it can be a nightmare for us too
De broglie is a noble french family but was italian (from Piemont) at first so i think that they don't pronounce the g so it sounds like "de bro-i" and it sounds more like de Breuil
That's my theory tell me if i am wrong i'd like to know what the hell happened with that name
I mean that, we have silent letters and such but we're pretty consistent in term of pronunciation and use of said silent letters
In the example the first guy posted, we have all the different forms of "ver" but they're all pronounced the same just with different meanings and spellings, if English had a word like that, it'd be an absolute clusterfuck where the "e" would be pronounced differently in every single meaning of the word in addition to random silent letters, like the whole though, through thing
French has silent letters but there is a pattern to it
Yeah but it's way less random
Yeah, that's probably it
But the first time I had an oral exam and said de Bro-gue-lie and my teacher laughed and corrected me, I genuinely wondered if he was just punking me
The throne
We've also got the extremely classy "chiotte"... which just means "shitter
There's also an proverb which sounds a little bit similar to the one OP gave: "Sur le plus haut trône du monde, l'homme n'est toujours assis que sur son cul" (On the highest throne in the world, one is still only sitting on their ass)
Not totally sure it's related to the toilet "throne", but I've always pictured a king shitting for that one
Ah yes, a man of refined taste, I see
Écureuil, quincaillerie
Came in handy during a "try to pronounce this
" game when I was doing a student exchange
sadly it was a French-German exchange
"Curieux" is always a good one, as it combines U, R and a i sound right after
I had a uni professor who had been living in the country for 25 years who still struggled with that one
Another would be "chirurgien urologue", same seasons as above and also has a nasal vowel
Écureuil is definitely the one we have the most fun with
Works nicely on the flip side too, because a lot of French folk have a hard time pronouncing the English equivalent, squirrel
My gf is polish, she showed me this movie with Grzegorz
I try to learn polish, but sometimes it's nearly impossible haha
Even the letters ś and ć are challenging to say :(
My favorite from my czech class was "strc prst skrz krk" (missing the accent on the "c")
It also works in slovak too
Grenouille or garage are great
And grenouille is quite fitting for us frogs
Or worse, "serrurerie".
yeah, *him* haha
I think I say it well sometimes, but it's still difficult
I think Italians may have an easier time with polish pronunciation than French ^^
I've heard this before but it's quite easy to pronounce
'squi (as in squish) - rull (as in pull)'
In Marseille, calling your friends Fra or Frate has become a trend a few years back
Of course it comes from Italian
Other common way, at national level this time, is to call your bro, "gros". Means fat
But applies just to anyone
I call them "frère" (bro), "mec" (dude) or sometimes "bg" (pronounce "bégé, short for "beau gosse", literally handsome man but the expression kinda lost it's meaning nowadays, especially on Twitter)
This is fun
I call my friends "mec" or "meuf" basically dude for male and dude for female
Gros (fat), frère (brother), bg (beau gosse=handsome guy), mec (guy)
Mec (dude), meuf (girl), poto (friend), frère (brother), gros (fat)
I think the most generally known one are "mec" (mate) , some people use "frère" (brother)
We personally call ourselves "Michel" , even the ladies
I tend to call my friends or my brother "vieux" (old), too
It heavily depends on the socio-cultural background and age, but here in a little provincial town "mec" is by far the most used on a day-to-day basis
We also use "gros" but I think it's falling out of fashion for people under 30yo
Yes I guess because about 1/3 of Marseille population is of italian descent (including me)
Tio, que pasada
Jejeje
In France we have BG (beau gosse) which means the same
According to this wikipedia page, there are about 300,000 people of italian descent, 300,000 of corsican descent, and 200,000 of north african descent
In Brittany, LOTS of our folklore is linked to Wales and Cornwall
I guess it's because our languages were very close
Sometimes, it is also about Ireland and Scotland
Here is my favorite myth, a combinaison of Atlantis and mairmaid !
In the early days of Christianity the city of Ys, or Ker-Ys, was the richest trading port in the Atlantic
Ships and merchants from south and north came to the Bay of Douarnenez in south-west Brittany to buy and sell luxury goods
The city was rich and lively, but it was also too much given to lust and sin as to arouse the ire of Breton Saint Gwenole, who foretold the city’s ruin
The city of Ys was ruled by the king Gradlon, who was also the king of Cornwall
He was a religious and pious man who was grieved by the shameful behaviour of the city and of his wayward daughter, the princess Dahut
The city of Ys was protected from the ocean by a strong dyke and by a gate built into the dyke to take the outflowing tidal water, and only king Gradlon alone possessed the key to the gate
One night, while king Gradlon was sleeping, princess Dahut stole the key from his father for the purpose of opening the city gate for her lover, a demon
As she opened the gate, the ocean immediately rushed in and submerged rapidly the wicked city
As the city was being destroyed by the water, Saint Gwenole commanded king Gradlon to flee
He mounted his horse Morvarc’h and took his daughter Dahut behind him, with the incoming flood about to submerge them
Gwenole further commanded king Gradlon to throw the demon he was carrying into the sea
Gradlon hesitated but he finally obeyed the Saint
As Dahut was thrown off his horse into the water, king Gradlon managed to escape and save his life
After the city of Ys was destroyed, king Gradlon moved to the city of Quimper and kept a low profile for the rest of his life
As to his daughter Dahut, she was changed into a mermaid and was condemned to sing her remorse forever in the bay of Douarnenez, where she loved and feasted
Popular folklore tells that she often appears to fishermen, combing her long golden hair and luring sailors to their doom
It is also believed that when the sea is calm one can hear the bells of the church of Ys ringing from the depths of the bay
> I guess it's because our languages were very close
Same [ancestry]
new years eve
and the 14 of july thats when the revolution took over a prison and got weapons, it's our national holiday
And the 15th of August (the Assumption)
Battle named "Le chemin des dames" in WW1, a french officer was captured some days before the attack with complete plans of the offensive, date and place of bombing, etc
Nivelle attacked without caring
~~Napoleon~~ Murat advancing casually towards the enemy with a big smile and his arms wide open as if peace had been signed so the enemy didn’t fire at his men and him as they crossed the bridge, only to charge them as soon as the bridge was crossed
It was such a crazy bet
Also Charles VI a mad king who sometimes had episodes where he attacked anyone he saw in a murderous rage and had to be physically restrained, in some cases after he killed several of his own me
This king also thought he was made of glass and demanded to be carried in a special cushioned container
Honestly, 2010 French football team "strike" was kinda cringe
The government actually payed salves owners for the losfrom the abolition of slavary, and since slaved didnt get any help they had to get employed by their previous owner which would jsut pay them enought to buy food
Sorry for the spelling and all
Not history but 2 guys 4 years ago tried to rob a McDonald's. Turns out they picked the wrong one because there was 11 GIGN elit soldiers eating there
The GIGN is specialized in intervention and anti terrorist/hostage situations
To be fair it was the usual Nivelle battle plan : rush enemy machine gun emplacements until they run out of bullets or we run out of bodies, it was not really a problem even if they knew everything
Getting England, France and Germany to get along smooth is hell of an achievement
Didn't she once claim that Iran and Pakistan were in the EU
Sounds like classic 14-18 warfare
Excuse me, king Edward VII with his mysterious sex chair and resident room in a Paris brothel
It was during the Franco-Dutch War and it was just two german states allied to France that invaded them in 1672 actually (Cologne and Munster I think)
The two states then left the war in 1673 when the HRE led by Austria as well as Spain entered it on the side of the Dutch haha
England was allied to France as well and was supposed to invade by sea but after several naval defeats at the hands of the Dutch left the war in 1674, leaving France facing a coalition from 1674 to the end of the war in 1678 . That whole thing was a shitshow and you would have expected Louis XIV to chill out once we got a fairly good deal out of that war but no
the fucker was again embroiled in the Nine Years' War against an even bigger coalition after having annexed the entirety of Alsace, which started France's financial problems, made even worse by his revocation of the edict of Nantes
What pisses me off the most about Louis XIV is that he didn't even lose any of his wars, but the gains for France were never worth the amount of money and ressources spent
Louis XIV managed to both be the greatest king in french history and one of the worst as well at the same time
Making France the most powerful political, cultural and military power in Europe while at the exact same time leaving it on the brink of bankrupcy by the time of his death
I don't even know why I am ranting right now
the dude just infuriates me lmao
Good catch, it was Murat indeed
New Caledonia isn't accessible without a visa if you aren't French or Kanak
Our border with Spain changes every 6 months
We even have a Spanish village within France
Also we border Suriname, Brazil and the Kingdom of the Netherlands
Piggy-backing this one for France:
Longest border with another country : brazil
Longest domestic flight : 12 hours to la reunion, south of Madagascar
Largest EEZ in the World
Largest number of Time zones of any countries
World's most productive workers (we work less but get more done during our work jours)
Those are thé one i Can think of on the top of my mind
I didn't even knew about this
Wait, what
I've never seen a kiwi from Italy nor from China, in France all our kiwis come whether from France or New-Zealand
Wanted to check it out, got a good laugh
And our longest labd border is with brazil
Ah ! Interesting ! I get to ask you the questions I always asked myself about this place
Are all people there bilingual ? Do you try to get most of your chores (groceries and all) done in Spain or it doesn't matter as much ? Do some people work in France ? How did it work before Schengen to go from Spain to France and then Spain again ? Do people feel isolated from the rest of Spain ?
Muchas gracias !
Hey, I'm from not too far from there on the French side (Prades, if it rings a bell
Ah yes, I always forget about this one !
Exactly
My lazy ass thanks you for taking the time to source this
Haha France better
We have [Maripasoula] which is 18000 km^2 wide but has only 13000 inhabitants
Very interesting,  thank you for your answer !
You do ! I've always wondered how it feels like to live there
Do you do things mostly on the French side (grocery shopping etc) or do you go to Spain for it ?
Before Euros, in France we had Francs, and 1€=7 francs, so a "franc" cent was even cheaper than a cent of euro, and before 2002, there were some cheap things like candies sold for a few "francs" cents
So it was quite logical to have 1 and 2 cents euro coins with prices like that
However, prices got higher and higher and now we don't need those coins anymore
Wait wait wait, is France and Germany the only country to pay the exact price
Like I flabbergasted when I meant people in Ireland and other countries round it up
Like, even if I know 1,99 is the same as 2 and the 0,99 is only here to make me think that it's cheaper, in the end there is no reason for me to pay more than what is demanded
Also people seem to think that the only way to pay 1,99 is to give exactly 0,99 cents when here everyone will just give directly 2€ and the cashier will just have to give you 1 cent back
It's just quicker
Edit: I'd like to say that I'm not against removing them, but prices must adapt to end with a 0 or a 5
But as long as prices will be 0,99 there's not a chance for us to pay more than the price of the object/service
But, but, but, WHY would we lose money
If the price is 1,99€ and you give a coin of 2€ the cashier will give you one cent back
I don't understand your problem
In France there are three types of *Catholic (edit, as there are other Boy Scouts too) Boy Scouts: the European Boy Scouts are not officially recognized, as they are too
military/far right/conservative
I guess it’s not the same in all groups but yeah, that’s how we usually imagine them to be
Then they are the SUF (Scouts unitaires de France - United scouts of France), they ressemble your scouts when it comes to the age of the « chefs » (18-25 years old) and to games
We have to take part in the games, though, and would not leave in the middle of it
But we are quite close to them (I would not speak of my love problems with one of them but then, neither do I with most of my friends and family so it might just be me)
Finally there are the SGDF (Scouts et guides de France - Scouts and ... scoutess ? Girl Scouts of France)
They are the only ones including girls in the name, though all three types of scouts have girls groups, because they are the only one with mixed groups
They are the most progressive ones, and the bigger organization: the SUF tend to work by church, whereas the SGDF work by church and are connected France-wide
I’d say that they are similar to your scouts
Both SUF and SGDF have scouts names (I don’t know about the others, they might) but they are usually kept secret
They can be that of an animal or that of a flower
The secret and ritualistic part is truer among the SGDF than among the SUF: I was a SUF and my name was given to me in front of the whole group, for example
And we have the same names as you do, the little boys are "louveteaux" (little wolves), and the group is called a pack (la meute)
Girls names are different (jeannettes)
Sorry for long comment
There are a lot more than just 3 types of Scouts in France
Even considering only the French Scoutism Federation, there are 6 types : SGDF (as you described, and by far the largest group), EEUdF, EEdF, SMF, EEIF, EdlN
Regarding the scouts name, it depends a lot on the group : many of them do not give such names anymore
FYI : "guide" is called
"guide" in english ;)
I think that the religious link is more prevalent in France, or at least it is seen as such
Scouts are definitely something I associate with Conservative, upper-class catholics with a closeted military fetish
I have learned that its not the case for all scouting groups, but they are certainly less mainstream than in other countries I think
>rom the USA but on an exchange year in The  Netherlands, and I do scouting in both countries
I find the responses a bit funny because my experiences have been the complete opposite
As a USF i dont really consider SF as "whimps", i just see their movement as more accessible to the general public whereas ES & USF are more religious and have more "paramilitary" tendencies
The later vary greatly by troops or by groups but is usually a lot more prevalent than in Scouts of France groups
These tendencies can be really fun and motivating and have lots of positive aspects, but i understand why they're not for everyone
IMO the diversity of movement is great because it allows for different kind of people to get different kind of experiences
As scouts were introduced in France by a catholic priest, the vast majority of scouts are catholics
But our country is increasingly secular and having the biggest group of scouts be more relax about religion or inherent paramilitary background of scoutism makes it accessible and fun for a broader audience
Thanks for the info
I did not know of the other groups, will look them up :)
And thanks for the English term, it really was bothering me
Some people answered to my comment to remind me not to forget about Jewish and Muslim scouts and I’m glad they did
I know other scouts exist, but I do by reflex associate them with Catholicism (as I was in a catholic scout group)
I really don't think scouts were introduced in France by a catholic priest
In the early years, scoutism was even denounced by the catholic church while some guys (including a few pastors) created many groups and founded the EdF and EUF !
SMF  = Scout Musulmans de France and the eclaireurs are laics
I knew I was forgetting something
There are indeed Muslim and Jewish scouts in France, and I guess that there are Protestant scouts too, and probably others
Sorry for the omission, I chose to only speak of those I know and forgot to say this
Thanks for the reminder
There are some, especially in southern France
The [Maison Carrée] is one of the famous ones
Very well preserved
Hmmm, let me check, but I think we might have one or two
The region I'm from has [one of the best preserved roman theatres] just a few hundred meters from [a triumphal arch]
Also this big triumphal arch in my city : [Porte de Mars]
Bordeaux has some ruins of a Roman Amphitheater, le Palais Gallien
Les arènes de Nîmes :
Same here
There was a construction site near my HS where they discovered a column, the entire site stayed empty with just the column standing for like 2 years
Lots of money must have been wasted (for the construction guys, still cool for museums and stuff I guess
Can’t believe I didn’t think of that one
Most reknown by far :)
And in Nîmes [this is considered the best preserved Roman amphitheater in the world]
Grew up near Orange and went to middle and high school there, I was hoping to see it mentionned in the comments :)
Edit: if you're in the area and interested in Roman ruins, you also have to go to [Vaison-la-Romaine] nearby
[Partenaire Particulier]
I know all the goddamn lyrics by heart
I think France is a pretty good place for electronic / tech music
So I'd say Le Wanski - Tarte à la myrtille
Good music for late parties when everyone is either dead or dying
Ha ha fucking hell I forgot about that one
Otherwise there's always a bit of Philippe Katerine
I don't know think you can get a more portuguese song than Quim Barreiros xD Plus the songs always make me smile with how silly the lyrics are most of the time xD
Well, TIL I guess, didn't know that
Maybe something like "we have the most superior bread". Anything else may cause massive rioting
Almost everyone hates Macron, whether you're right or left
And I think it's beautiful
Must tell you about a thread on /r/France we had a few years ago about the french living abroad
They were all telling us their expériences and the pros and cons of the country they were living in
2 things came out every goddamn time that you can say that every french agrees on definitely :
- Everyone abroad is nice, more than french people
- Everywhere they eat shit and our food is better
I, personaly, only lived in England abroad, so I can agree on those statements, but it's way too easy to talk about the british cuisine
username checks out
France is good candidate
We’ve never agreed on anything except for the most basic things about our culture
No he is actually more popular than Hollande at the same period with about 30% of favorable opinions
The way French politics work is simple:
1) Elect a guy
2) Immediately hate him for no real reason
3) Ask for his resignation 2 weeks after he was elected
I don’t think there is any counter example in the recent history
Edit: typos, numbers
If a presidential election was held right now he would be re-elected
Even some of us French agree
You agree on something wrong
Pretty much the same when I went to Germany
Schwarzbrot ? Oh fuck no
It's ok though because you have Bretzels
Well of course he still is, he isn't going to resign on his own will, it's France, the Republic with the president with the most power in the world
People don't let their power go in a snap
Any dish where you add "English" in front becomes automatically disgusting
I mean, we have so many cheese, if you don't think that a French one is better than the one you prefer, it's most probably because you haven't heard of it yet
Na, so far I've always clocked my countrymen after one sentence max
That accent
Yes
Just once, while me and my friends were in London
We were at a coffee shop, the waiter started to take our order in english, we only spoke a few words or sentences until he asked in French if we were French as well though
We French people tend to have quite a thick accent
Yes, it has
Pretty much inevitable
No awkward moment followed, though, just peals of laughter !
Yeah once
I was travelling in Mexico with my girlfriend, we had rented a room in a guesthouse owned by a family
We started doing check in and he asked where we were from, soon as I answered he said "oh I'm French too". Turns out he was even from the same city as I was, had married a Mexican woman and came to live in the country
The only time I had struggle to spot a fellow french man, he had the double nationality franco-english
Except that, it's extremly easy
Our accent is thick :/
Clothes, the accent, the attitude and topics of conversation
The French can't hide
mais tellement
them : élo ! awaryou ?
me : oui, bonjour !
Porch pirates is not really a problem because we have no porches
Seriously either you live in an urban area and then you are living in an appartment, or you are living in a less densely populated area and then you may have something similar to American subburbs with cookie cutter houses
But, we have locked mailboxes
So either the package fits and the mailman leaves it in your mailbox, or if it's too big, he is supposed to ring your doorbell and hand it to you
If you are not there (or he has no time/willingness to ring), he will leave a notice saying your parcel will be available at the post office for pick up from next day
In a nutshell, unless you are living in a rural, safe area, the mailman will not leave your parcel outside
The real issue is parcels getting "lost" while going through sorting centers
This happens a little too often
Here they live the package on doorstep ONLY if you ask for
You also have to possibility to ask them to deliver it to your neighbours (and you have to tell wich one)
If you have a normalized mailboxe, then it's big enough for a regular package and every deliver man have a key
When they arrive they often call you, ask if you're at home, if not they would just do what you ask for: live it on the porch for exemple
If they don't call you and you gave no instruction they will come back the day after
You also have the option to live it at a nearbye shop
Not that I’m aware of, here in France the deliverers has been practicing the art of pretending you’re not here to not deliver your package and piss off your entire day
No package and thus no theft
I sometimes find mine left on top of the locked mailbox if it doesn’t fit, even pre-Covid but more so now
My neighbours could easily steal it but I’m from a sleepy village that’s pretty much just old people and I doubt any of them have much interest in stealing my stuff
I’ve never had a problem with that or heard of anybody else having
>unless you are living in a rural, safe area, the mailman will not leave your parcel outside
OH the innocence
Many will leave the parcel outside in a urban area, where it will quickly be stolen
I swear Hermes only ever leave my parcels in the paper recycling on bin day     I got a message from them last week saying they’ve successfully delivered my parcel and the proof of delivery was a photo of a bemused looking old lady holding my Debenhams order in the doorway of a house that I don’t even recognise
Yes, it happens a lot around me
I’m lucky there’s a guy in charge of all packages in my apartment building, because lots of my friends have experience with stolen packages
Well with the covid contactless stuff, yes
Behind the joke, I meant we have different demographics, different urban layouts, and different housing types, which makes the porch pirate american phenomenon much much less acute
Porched houses are not very common
At least it is not the staple urban or even suburban architecture like it is in the US
Like, we might have a small roof right over the external doors but it’s only a tiny bit of token shelter
As for those big, elevated, even wrap-around porches: I’ve only ever seen them in American TV
Eindhoven in the Netherlands
Left Breda for a job there, boy did I ever so regret that decision
Issoudun , France
Saint-Etienne
Sure it’s a fairly large french city, but it is very Soviet to me
Large apartment complexes, lots of dead industry, unfriendly people, and it’s not very clean
People from Paris make the city seem artificial and soulless, it has history, but current Paris is a pretty but hollow shell
I passed through Belgrade via the highway, it was quite disturbing all this brutalist architecture and the ugly double concrete tower
I love Sofia !
Yes, but the interesting thing is love is that while it can cherish even the most minute things, there must be still be something to love
A small brook near my home means far more to me than to a stranger, but there's still a charm point
It must be theoretically possible to have homes which outright discourage emotional value
the old town is quite cute
Make sure you order “poisson” (fish) at the restaurant, and not “poison” (poison)
Not in my language but my mom always told me of that time in Germany in his friend family when her mom said
* Die Nudeln sind fertig : The pastas are cooked
* Die Judeln sind fetig : The Jews are cooked
My mom was in panic for a moment until she undertood
Not a letter but a coma
"On bute, karadoc" (we're stuck, karadoc)
"On bute karadoc" (we kill karadoc)
I was going to say the letter ‘e’. It may not be a fish or death situation, but you also do not want to get genders confused
Merci beaucoup Vs Merci beau cul
Thank you very much Vs Thank you beautiful ass
That's in most languages though, for example in English "we have ended, karadoc
" vs "we have ended karadoc
" ("on a fini, karadoc" vs "on a mis fin à karadoc")
I'd say we can have pretty different outcomes with some misplaced accents but we'll usually still get the original meaning depending on context
Not exactly
"J'en n'ai plus" is the correct spelling
The correct formal version would be "Je n'en ai plus", not "J'en n'ai plus". But we drop the *ne/n'* in informal speech so they become the same, except for the pronunciation of the ending *s*.
In France public university is free
However private schools are expensive
Problem is, the best schools are mostly in Paris and living there is very expensive
Public universities are free in France but for the private ones it's between 200 and 10000€ per year
Public universities are free in France but there is a kind of tax ( CVEC ) for students, so it’s 90 euros a year actually
Aside, if you are from modest families you can be housed in a CROUS building for a very small rent, and there is such buildings next to almost every universities, and anyway you have an help from the state for this rent ( APL ) wich is ~220 euros every month + a another one ( bourse ) if you come from a poor family
What is cheaper in your country than in the rest of Europe
Probably baguettes, around 80-90 € cents
Internet access and a phone plan
I would say electricity !
Wine, cheese, vegetables and fruits, charcuterie
The cheapest places you can find are markets with local products basically
Bread is super cheap too
And waffles
Can't imagine waffles being sold for 2€ on the streets here in France
Internet maybe and shitty wine/beer
And cigarettes and alcohol
A lot of pubs and bars or regular people in the south of France go to Spain to buy alcohol
Alcohol in bars and outside of bars, cigarettes are way cheaper than in France
Around the same price here in France, I pay 12€ for 60gb unlimited calls SMS MMS etc
You need a new low cost internet provider to shake up the market
In France, prior to the creation of "Free", we were just being screwed over by the other 3 main providers
It's mostly due to the low quality of food
Almost US-bad quality
Yes definetly, It's just that Spain is really close and you don't risk being controlled as much
Especially if you are coming from Eastern Europe, they control you for cigarettes and alcohol since a lot of people buy it ridiculous quantities and resell
Well some essentials : 6 eggs for around 1€ in the small stores (not the best quality) fruits and vegetables are ridiculously expensive if you buy it in supermarkets 3€ for an avocado where I live
Milk is like 1€ per litre
Wine starts around 1€ per 75cl and around 5-6 for a decent wine
Alcohol is cheaper than in Belgium but not in pubs
Meat prices really vary
Sometimes 6€ for 1kg of chicken sometimes 12€. Restaurants from my experience were cheaper in the Netherlands
No way you can get a good meal in a touristic area in France for a reasonable price( apart from fast food obv)
> It's mostly due to the low quality of food
Almost US-bad quality
I would have to disagree with you there, though to be fair, I buy mostly fresh food products in both the UK and France
Veg prices are similar, but meat and dairy prices in the UK are cheaper (for free-range chicken and eggs, pork filet, mainly)
I can even get President butter and French cheese brands cheaper in the UK than in France
One thing that is noticeably more expensive in France is fresh milk
Fuck that paying double the price for fresh milk v UHT in France
Tinned foods are usually cheaper in the UK (tomatoes, chickpeas, etc
) and I've yet to find a French supermarket Indian curry that tastes vaguely 'Indian', so I don't bother any more
Mix it with rice
Wtf, what kind of heathen are you
j/k, but I've NEVER heard of that
TIL
Tbh I only have beans on toast, with fish fingers and chips or with a fry-up
Definitely, they scare my girlfriend, but they soothe me, I can remain stucked, my nose on a window looking at them, and the sound of thunder helps me fall asleep
It's one of my favourite thing and a large part why I'm moving back south as soon as I can
I do because i'm then happy as fuck to be inside in my bed

Heeeeeey ! An English(wo)man speaking our language flawlessly ! What a sight to see ! :)
"Tu m'casses les couilles
Potentially, we have wolves & brown bears on land, sharks & jellyfish in the sea & ocean
In terms of numbers, I couldn't find any data for France, but according to estimates, the top 3 are : wasps/bees (allergic reactions, a dozen per year), dogs (attacks, less than 10 per year), and deers/boars (road collisions, less than 10 per year)
I'm sure there are super dangerous snake/insects/spider/puma/crocodile in Guyane
But I'm not an expert on the subject
We also have scorpions in Southern France
The black ones are only painful (think wasp), but the yellow ones are dangerous
I think they're mainly found in the PACA region, not much elsewhere
Is that where you live
In France (in parenthesis is a parallel in a IT Company) :
President : in charge of deciding on directions the country will go
(Champion or Sponsor)
Ministers : translate those directions into smaller and practical bits (Project Managers)
Senators/Deputies : role is to come up with practical laws/rules to support those Directions (Developers)
In France the PM is chosen by the president to form and lead the government
The president is also in exclusive charge of France's foreign policy (like deciding to go to war)
As such the French president is the chief of the armies
In case of a major security crisis for the nation (ie when the Republic is in danger), the president can call a special session of the parliament and invoke article 16 of the French constitution to obtain the full powers for a renewable period of six months
It only happened once, by Charles de Gaulle during the Algeria War
In most european country, the power is held by a prime minister/chancellor/president of council/other, with a superior entity above that is essentially symbolic, like a president or a king/queen
An exception is France, where the President has actual powers (many powers in fact) and the prime minister is more of an “““aide””” (with massive quotes) that is in charge of coordinate the government according to the policy decided by the president
Lol "only by Merkel". I'd like being greeted by Merkel
I'm never greeted by anyone when I go to Germany
I will just add something to the last one: sénateurs and députés from the same colour as the government are doing that, the role of the opposition is a counter power
Not a thing in France
Most people don’t notice, and flags had been out of fashion for a time: flying one roughly meant “yeah, I’m nationalist af
” for some times, so usually not very pro-Europe
(This changed in 2015, after terrorist attacks flying the flag became more “normal” again)
Flags aren't really a thing here, so no
Also, I don't know if it's me being stupid, but I didn't know there was a Europe Day so
It's not a thing at all, I doubt that anyone except institutions have a European flag
Even french flags are not so used it July 14th
Only far right political fans and maybe sport fans use it
I don't know anyone with a flag
Never heard of this date, never have seen any EU flag on a house and ofc I won't do it
Same in Paris
French flags on the 8th (VE Day), European flags on the 9th
That's sad but it's true, nowadays flying a french flag or like having it in your twitter name (or worse, on your property like an American redneck) has become a nationalist/racist thing
Shouldn't be the case but they really ruined it
(Amongst other stuff, thinking about viking symbols etc)
La Haine for France
Comedy: 2 heures moins le quart avant Jésus Christ / Les tontons flingueurs / Les Bronzés.
Policier: Tchao Pantin / L'union sacré.
There's so much of them
I would recommend Mauvais Sang by Leos Carax
I would've said something by Louis de Funès
I watched this movie once and cried so much I can't bring myself to watch it again
Luxembourg to get the list of tax evaders
Plus, they open black holes on a daily basis, so who knows how many alien civs they already contacted through them
We can still invade the Metro station though
No, that's SERN, not CERN
Totally different thing ^(I guess)
Hey, Mister I am mad scientist
It's so cool
Sunvabitch
If you had to chose one european head of government or president to replace yours, who would you pick ?
Let's pick only politicians that are in place as we speak
Merkel is the obvious choice, though she has to be nearing the end of her career at this point and is obviously not perfect
but I don't know who i would prefer in the current crop, among those I'm familiar with anyway
Honestly just take Macron out
I don’t even care at this point
I’m hesitant between Angela Merkel and Giuseppe Conte
So we dislike Macron's stance but we want Merkel
She would get gilets jaunes style riots in less time than Macron tbh
Hell no anyone but Merkel
She’s the main reason why the immigration crisis was such a disaster and in that situation cared more about the immigrants than her people
I love your 2
Made me chuckle
So the honeymoon phase is over and done, right ?
a) some people are conservative, even though it's probably not the majority around here given Reddit demographics
b) a moderate conservative who's competent and honest still seems pretty good
I mean what are our other options
Why do you think Merkel is a bad pick ? It's true that she has an aura of being the "perfect" politician seen from abroad, though many German dislike her
Mutti is a childish way to say mum if I'm not mistaken
Well yeah, if you're a far-right nativist, obviously Merkel is no good for you
Which is precisely why I like her
Who's your pick, Orban
Johnson
Lmao being against mass immigrations = being a nazi, that's what you mean ?
>  It's true that she has an aura of being the "perfect" politician seen from abroad
Lmao
You just speak for yourself
Well, Merkel isn't actually as lax on immigration policy as nativists like to claim
She took the initiative in that direction and no one followed, including social democrats as you mention, and since then she hasn't been that bold in that department
To be fair that’s what this kind of thread lead to
Like, there are a lot of people here idolizing Macron for the EU stuff but actually he’s corrupted as hell ( Alstom scandal, Ferrand scandal, weird presidential party, coronavirus outbreak management etc ) and has been elected without programm litteraly but people glorify him here as well
About Orban/Salvini I don’t care, we have the equivalent in our opposition and she is laaaaame
But I do care about mass immigration and its consequences yea
I like that the pronunciation is completely fucked, it makes it more like a mysterious language only the worthy can know
The swears are very great, always a joy to swear loudly in French
I love the translation of The Sorting Hat from Harry Potter
Choixpeau
Choix = choice
Chapeau = hat
Mix together and one obtains choixpeau !
The sassiness you can get from normal words, and the power of insults
Also, as a French, you suffer from learning it at school, so all the latin languages are easier to learn and you also are more used to have a hard time writing or conjugating in another language
We've got an informal word that means "to slap one's face with one's penis". The word is "une bifle" and it's the contraction of "une bite" (a dick) and "une gifle" (a slap)
I love the reaction people have when I tell them this fun fact
I'm also looking at us don't worry
I'm pulling my hear at the way we write our language
Especially you PH, I'm talking about you
Italians are always worthy, unlike some others I won't mention but rhymes with Dickland
Wait, what is a portemanteau ? The name of the hat ?
Ohhh ok thank you
On top of my mind:
Frog legs, snails, some (old) cheeses, "pieds et paquets" (guts and pork foot bones)
*Steak tartare* which is seasoned raw beef
Hmmm, a lot ! Let's start with the all so famous snails or the frog legs
They are delicious btw
Any meal that has innards or from other organs like "andouillette" and "rognon". Pig legs, pig nose, pig ears and everything in the pig
Strong and smelly cheese
We eat everything there is, french cuisine is not just defined by high class gourmet stuff
Oh yeah and tongue, that's good too but only when it's served hot
Some of our cheese
Even here, most people aren't big fans of "strong cheese," like bleu, roquefort or maroilles
And frogs and snails
I love the raw herring you can buy in the street in The Netherlands
I've never heard of pieds et paquets before, is it a regional dish
Not only isn't Gravlax disgusting, it's a fucking great delicacy
that’s freaking delicious ! but i wouldn’t eat it during hot summer or at dinner or somewhere i don’t know
this is kind of a risky meal but definitely worth it
Haha :) Did you enjoy this "quail"?
Wow
Even snails
I hate the rubber texture
For me, it tastes like  a mix of chicken and fish
Nothing special as you say
I don't think so
So do I, but only rarely because my stomach is not fond of it haha
There is no rice inside blood sausages in France
>Things such as services, clothes and food, especially restaurants, are expensive
Yes, also relative to income
We lack a restaurant culture
Copenhagen is amazing for restaurants and street food from all corners of the world (or so I’ve had multiple even Southern Europeans tell me), yet average people go out to eat like once a month or less
Much less in the countryside
This was very striking to me as a tourist
Everything is sandwiches and incredibly expensive anyway
France is already expensive compared to the rest of Europe though
So I live in Germany and I have lost touch a bit with the prices in France, and I also lived in Paris which is especially expensive
But I’ll give it a try
- nothing in the supermarket costs less than 1€, not the cheapest thing, or maybe barely
You cannot buy more than one item with one euro
- the cheapest meal you will find (sandwich, crepes, kebab type thing), really barebones with no drink or dessert is already at least 8-10€ maybe 7 if you are very lucky but with the quality that goes with a lower price
- in an actual restaurant, the cheapest meal is usually 12-15€, except maybe if you only have a soup (8-10€ or so)
A nicer dish (say, with meat) will be around 16-18€ and that is still without drink or dessert or any extra
If you go to a fairly good restaurant, have an appetizer and a dish and a drink, it easily goes up to 30€.
- in cafés, tea is 5€, coffee is 2€ at least
- in bars, one beer is 8€ (cheaper in some places but you kind of have to know where to look), cocktails 12€
- in supermarkets, beer is way cheaper at around 2€ per bottle for the cheapest
Still more expensive than other countries
A frozen pizza would start at 4€, maybe 3 if really really basic
Then of course you have cheaper things, pack of noodles at 1€, or below if you take the ultra cheap brand
1€ buys you a pack of flour, a pack of sugar, a pack of noodle (more or less), a baguette
-cigarettes are also super taxed and expensive, I don’t smoke but i know it was 10€ a pack when I left the city
For drinks and restaurant meals, you can shave 1-2€ off everything and have the outside-of-Paris price
But it is still not that cheap in comparison to say, Germany
Funnily enough, I almost edited my main comment to say that wine is probably the only thing that is comparatively cheap in France
It's our consolation :)
Germany is fairly cheap in relation to salaries
I feel like Belgium and the Netherlands were also generally affordable
Italy is also cheaper than France, but I don‘t know how the salaries differ
Some of these are very Parisian lol
I know, the 8€ beer
I don‘t miss it
But the Parisian region is one ~~tenth~~ \*sixth of the French population, so it does represent a fair bit of the French experience
It was so stressful living in Paris though
The smallest outing with a friend, and you spent 5€ to drink mediocre tea in a cafe that you left after one hour and a half because the waiter was shooting dirty looks at you for occupying the table too long
I mean, we'd need to compare buying power rather than prices
Since most of Europe uses the euro, the comparison is more worthwile
You're right, it's one sixth
I always mix up 10 mil = one 6th with 6 mil = one tenth
It's used a lot, as much as a french word
It's not seen as an english word, just a word we use a lot
The direct equivalence in french is "d'accord" so as "ok" is way shorter it's very commonly used while texting and speaking ( "d'accord" is still commonly used as a stronger "ok" )
Well as "d'acc" is as short as ok I prefer to use the French word
Ça c'est de la référence
It is but saying ok is easier than repeating d'accord, d'accord, D'ACCORD
Also we don't use okay, only ok
And we only use it to agree
We don't say something is ok commonly, but it may happen
Oké???? That's how southern french people sound saying it but nobody write it like that
We just use ok
It's pronounced okê where I live
I've heard "rendi" as a short version for "rendben" is it also commonly used
Only for Québec
Here it means rather Thursday/Friday
Fin de semaine depends on the context but it nearly always means Thursday or Friday, especially in a work-related context, because we say week-end for Saturday and Sunday
As another comment said, "Fin de semaine" is understood as "the end of the week", which, in English as well, means "end of the work week" most of the time
Well pure french would be more similar to what they use in Québec, in France we are a lot more relaxed and use english word no problem, but some people sometime complain about it
The funny thing is that some world in english come from french, some were changed a little with time, and now we use the english word in french, when the word comes from the french to begin with
That it's preferable if he doesn't know anything
I would say we are doing alright
Could probably do better, but as it is we are definitely part of the lucky ones
We are cool with the germans now
You didn't ? Seems to me like you did
Really ? How about "Despite all the devastation, Europe managed to reconstruct and is now at peace, and has been for a half-century, and yes that inludes Germany
" ?
That is a happier way to look at it for sure
Every country has their idiots and in most of the world they do a decent score (including France)
I mean yes, but you still avoided having them for a much longer time than most European countries, and they haven't gotten as powerful as they have elsewhere
I'd say you've learned the lessons better than most
Sure, I should have said "Northern, Western and Central Europe".
Is boulangisme well known in Austria
It’s not even really well known in France as far as I know
That’s crazy I love France too
That’s what I suspected, Boulanger is kind of a footnote in French history, I don’t expect French people to know about him and even less so foreigners
There’s two big cities (not exactly big big but still) in my region, Nancy and Metz, whose been in conflict since 1420 to today
Both cities are beautiful and worth the visit, but what people don’t know is how much bickering there is between the two
May it be for historical reasons, football teams reasons, attracting people reasons, there’s always something, and even the inhabitants like to mock each other
The story between the conflict and of how long it’s been lasting it’s very interesting as well and it goes back almost to the moment the cities were built
For exemple when the region started plans for a TGV train station, Nancy said "We want it here
" And Metz said "No, we want it here", and it went on and on for a while until the regional council decided to put the train station in the middle of nowhere, away of the two cities
I love the history of my natal city Rouen
It was created by the viking Rollo, an English King was born there, the famous writer Guy de Maupassant was born there too and wrote some novels about it and many impressionist painters produced canvases of Rouen
There was a huge statue of Napoleon in front of the City Hall placed during the Second Empire but it was removed for restoration and we found a metal box under it with many books which are very deteriorated by humidity but people are working on recovering the books
There were like 4 train stations before train unionization but only one remain, the others have been destroyed but there are plans to construct a new one on site of one which was destroyed
This project is part of "Grand Paris" which aims to enlarge Le Havre sea port and connect it to Paris through the new train station in Rouen
I recently learned that at some point in history, there were _Swiss_ refugees going to France
It sounds super interesting (I’ve never heard of people leaving Swiss, always people going to Swiss to avoid persecution/one thing or another), I had never heard about it before, and I can’t find a thing on the topic
Malta is well known for the Christian crusaders
The name change was a mistake, Ragusa had some sort of brand recognition, Dubrovnik doesn't. Great suggestion though
Dubrovnik and Durrës used to be very important cities and they don't really get the press they deserve
It's okay you're all united in hating Paris
The only thing the whole France can agree on indeed
La Défense is pretty damn modern as it is the financial disctric of Paris, much like Wall Street in New York
Buildongs are very modern looking but there's also a lot of modern pieces of art
In France, it would be La Defense near Paris
It is basically a business district with skyscrapers
Nothing comes to mind and I hope it never happens
(Maybe puteaux
Our cities must keep their cultural cachet
Buildongs, because size matters
Hahaha eh merde
In France we have [Y] whose inhabitants are called the ypsiloniens which sounds way cooler than it has any right to
We have Y, a small village in Picardy, else there are also 2 hamlets named Ô in the South
With 2 letters, we have Ay, Bû, By, En, Eu, Fa, Gy, Oô, Oz, Py, Ré, Ri, Ry, Sy, Ur, Us and Uz
Someone must have had a lot of time and fun that day
Never learned another Romance language, but I basically understood what it was about for all of them
In terms of level of comprehension, I'd rank them as follows: Catalan > Italian > Romanian > Spanish > Portuguese
I might have stumbled on some pretty fortuitous Romanian articles though, I suspect I'd generally have an easier time with Spanish overall
Catalan was very easy, feels like I could read a pretty complex text and understand a lot of it
spanish, very big article, i knew the subject pretty well, so i guess i understood it easily
italien: small article, easy to understand
Portuguese: not much, apart for the words that are similar in french
Romanian: almost nothing :(
catalan: i guess it was an easy article, understood almost everything except a few words
&#x200B;
Romanina: it's about someone called Zoé. From the picture I guessed she was made a Saint
I understood she was the daughter of Constantin al VIII-lea and was consort impress
She died in 1050, the I'm not sure: in the house of  [Constantin al IX-lea] with him
&#x200B;
Italian one then: "Porto Lucena is a city from Brazil, in the state of  [Rio Grande do Sul] is part of  [mesoregione]  from the North-west of the Rio-grande and of the micri region of Santa Rosa"
Portugese:    Temecula is a city located in the American state of California, something about Riverside
It has been incorporated the 1th of december 1989
I openend a Romanian that was a few lines about a little town in Spain, so I tried again hoping to get something about Romania but I got a snake unique to Venezuela instead
Lol
Catalan led me to some peculiar fish of the sting ray family, ok
The Portuguese insists to be about UK Life Guards, lol again, so second draw in Portuguese is about Olympic swimming competition, butterfly breastroke in China, Nankin 2014, easy
I skip the 3 others because I know I can understand
I speak Spanish, French and Catalan, so it makes it much easier to understand the cousins
Italian: 98%, perhaps a word here and there that I miss, but would understand through context
Galego and Portuguese: 99%
Romanian: 60%, I brought though there if I were to learn how to pronounce the word, I'd understand significantly more
- Spanish: I speak Spanish a bit and could understand [most of the arcticle] without much difficulty
- Italian: Incredibly easy, I understood pretty much everything
feels like a mix between French and Spanish
As a bonus, [the article was very thematic]
- Portuguese: harder, but not *hard*. Reading it felt like bizarro Spanish, and I could understand the main points of the [again, very thematic article]
- Romanian: This one's a doozy
I could understand some sentences and the general meaning of [the arcticle] but not much else
- Catalan: Feels like bizarro French to read
I can understand most of [the arcticle] but it is harder than Spanish and Italian somehow
- Galician: Very, very very similar to Spanish with a Portuguese touch, so fairly easy to read and understad [this arcticle]
Overall, discounting Spanish that I speak, the easiest was definitely Italian and the hardest, by far was Romanian, followed by Portuguese
Got [this] and even if I don't speak italian, I could basically understand everything written
French : 100%; Spanish : 90%; Italian : 60%; Portuguese : 90%; Romanian : 30%; Catalan : 80%; Galician : 80%;
i tried again, and everything seems to be the same, except the catalan
I've understood nothing this time but the topic
Doesn't help that native speakers in both languages speak very fast
English is partly intelligible with Dutch
My favorite absurd translation is a multi-layered one, and it's for Ruben Östlund's film Turist
This is a Swedish film and that's the title in Swedish, and it so happens to be a "transparent" word in both English and French, meaning that it's understandable even if you don't speak the language
That didn't stop the marketing team from changing it though, oh no
In English, they went with "Force Majeure". The film does take place in France and this is a relatively well-known term in English (because it's used in law)
but it gets pretty funny when considering the title chosen for the French market
"Snow Therapy".
Swedish film, with a Swedish title understandable in both French and English, that gets a French title in English-speaking countries, and an English title in France
Gotta love it
Translating names in LotRO is perfectly appropriate considering in how much linguistics it's drenched
I'd even suggest that *not translating* would be something of a subversion or disrespect
The original work in English is itself stated by Tolkien as being a translation of an in-universe text, English acting as a medium for rendering the Common Tongue
Master Roshi from Dragon Ball is nicknamed "Tortue Géniale", a.k.a "Great / Awesome turtle". The turtle part makes sense, the "great" part I don't know where it comes from
The names of the main characters were not changed, except for *Neville Longbottom* that became *Neville Londubat* and *Tom Marvolo Riddle* that became *Tom Elvis Jedusor* (to keep the anagram *Je suis Voldemort*)
Also, *Hogwarts* became *Poudlard*.
Actually, the translator Jean-François Ménard did a pretty good job
The translator did a stellar job
The "elvis" part or the "jeu du sort" one ?
« Marvolo » sounds like the thing that comes out of your nose in French
« la morve ».
I think it really sucks for the history and the representation, I wouldn't say I'm devastated but I feel sad about it
I really hope it won't collapse
I imagine the Vatican is going to send us a paycheck
I don't care much -if at all- for the religious side of things
This is an architectural and historic loss, but it will be rebuilt and this will be part of its story, it was not entirely this original building already, so while this is bad, this is not the end of it
Many churches were already burnt almost to the ground and rebuilt, they're still historical buildings and it's part of their stories
TL:DR : Let's be positive
Edit: [Shared on r/France]
I'm on the verge of tears right now
It's horrible
It makes me really sad
I feel like I didn't take nearly enough time to appreciate it while it was up
I never thought it would be destroyed someday
It has always been here and I never considered it wouldn't be here anymore one day
I'm literally on the verge of crying
Luwembourgish is a mix of German, french, and luxembourgish, it’s pretty weird to hear because you’ll hear some completely unknown words and then boom you hear a few familiar one
It is, but it should be said that Walloon, unlike Flemish in Flanders, is not the language most people speak in Wallonia, right
It's mostly French
Yeah definitely
I guess your « personnality » depends how you learned the language:
-I learned French as my first language so im normal when I speak French
-I learned Portuguese with my family so Im way more down to earth when Im speaking Portuguese
-I learned English through Internet and by making friends around the world and I can feel the changes:like I speak louder faster and swear a lot
You really do change personnalities when you switch languages
Also I noticed how youre waay less shy and more willing to confess when you re not speaking in your native language
I'm way more confident in English
Also I'm still in France :(
> French - I complain more
Yep, you've got the french way figured out, good job
Vatican City
Sorry Esch-sur-Alzette
In my experience Bavarians feel more threatened by Hamburg than Berlin
Berlin is just on a whole other plane
Hahaha I meant that Bavarians don't even compare themselves to Berliner, because Berlin is almost like a foreign country
But I love the joke :D
Government collapses were quite common in France during the Third Republic (1870-1940) and the Fourth Republic (1946-54), both of which were parliamentary democracies
Governments were ephemeral because of party fragmentation and unstable coalitions – for instance there were 99 governments between 1879 and 1940
Our current, Fifth Republic is organised in such a way that Government collapses are extremely rare (only happened once in 1962)
We're technically a parliamentary regime – although in practice we're semi-presidential –, but there are two main factors which curb Government instability :
1/ Motions of no confidence have little chance of passing
Government is held accountable to the National Assembly (our lower house of Parliament) insofar that deputies may vote a motion of no confidence, but they usually don't do that, for two reasons :
* the number of votes required for the motion passing is high : it needs to be adopted by a majority of the members composing the Assembly, and not the majority of voters
* the Head of State (President of the Republic) can dissolve the National Assembly anytime he wants, which puts immense amounts of political pressure on Parliament
This is what happened in 1962 – the National Assembly voted a motion of no confidence against the Pompidou Government because they disagreed with De Gaulle's policy
So, in turn, De Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and reconstituted the Government, with Pompidou as Prime Minister just like it was before
Such a mechanism makes deputies unlikely to vote for a motion of no confidence, because the threat of dissolving the National Assembly would basically make them jobless
2/ the Head of State's and National Assembly's political party is usually the same
We call this the « fait majoritaire » (majority fact), and it happens because of three reasons :
* our Head of State, since 1962, is elected by universal suffrage with absolute majority (a second turn of elections is needed if no candidate receives 50 % on the first turn), so his election tends to reflect the majority political opinion in France, which in turn is reflect in ballots for legislative elections
* presidential and legislative elections are synced : since 2003, the Head of State is elected for five years instead of seven, which is the same length as a deputy's term of office
Our President's and deputies' elections cycles are therefore synced, with each happening one month apart
As the majority political opinion tends not to shift a lot during that time, and as voters tend to vote for the President's political party by default, the Head of State and President tend to be from the same party
* deputies are elected in a two-round ballot, which eliminates parties with too low scores and favors large groups and thus favors the creation of a strong majority in the National Assembly
Others Frenchs discribed our situation very well, but when I see how often government collapse around us, holy moly I'am happy that we threw away full parlementarism
I gave up understanding Italian politics a long time ago lol
Everytime I feel bad because I don't remember who is the PM of Italy but then I remember it changes all the time lmao
The only names I remember are Renzi, Conte, Salvini and Bersculoni
It's a very nice bonus for work is you do actually speak English (and didn't just say so on your resume) but the last stats I saw only 14% were able to speak a second language and most not to a fluent level
French people in Reddit are a small minority where speaking English in often the by-product of our interest (videogames, IT careers etc) but a lot of people outside that minority often see it as being pretentious to be able to speak English and something you shouldn't brag about
People here usually don't speak English very well, and often only know how to speak French at fluency level
People may know basic conversation/travel stuff (where's the airport, how are you) in usually Spanish or English
Speaking a foreign language at fluency level is seen as a nice asset
(There are of course French people who are bilinguals, I'm talking about the country as a whole
You're so right saying it's seen as pretentious and it infuriates me
I've immensely improved my English watching TV shows, reading and spending way too much time on reddit, and I must admit I tend to use "frenglish" a lot when I'm with friends
While most of them do the same, those who don't understand English (or don't want to) give me the look
Yes, disrespectful
At least with me, even  close friends would never do that
Even at my brother's house I don't do that
The only place I do it is at my parents' house
It's rude to search for things when you're a guest period
Yes, definitely
*But* I love it when my very, very closest friends (who will stay over regularly pre-Covid and crash on my sofa - or platonically in my bed) help themselves to things from my kitchen
Like giving them a key to my apartment so they can let themselves in before I arrive or take my dog out, I see it as such a fulfilling sign of how they’re like my family
I’m closer to my best friend than I suspect I’d ever be with an intimate partner tbh and I’m utterly comfortable in her company
Watching her make breakfast in my kitchen before she shoots off to work fills me with so much warmth
I love when her hair smells of my shampoo that she’s borrowed
I love when I can’t find my jacket and I have to text her and ask if she’s wearing it
I complain at the time and tell her she’s a pain in my arse but secretly I’m delighted
I’m so glad that my house is also her (other) home
I absolutely love British literature and the subtle, peculiar British humor that comes with it
Germany: all Germans I met were very cool and easy to talk with
They also tend to be frank which is something I value a lot
Belgium: awesome beer, my favorite in the world by far
Switzerland: gorgeous countryside, I also enjoy they direct democracy thing
I feel like we would have to strike less often with a similar system
Italy: food, culture and language
I feel like we are kindred spirits
As we say French people are Italian people in a bad mood
Spain: I don’t know much about them
I love chorizo so I will just say that
German politics are not as delusional under illusion of splendor as ours
I also enjoy German people being more straightforward as we are; Freikörperkultur is also something i admire
I love how Italians are so surrounded with antiques they don't care anymore and someone ends up graffing something actually funny/clever on it
(i'm speaking about the low low end of antiques you can find - like an old shitty column or smth)
I love how Belgian work hard party hard
And  their old goofy artists you always end up talking to  (after 3 pints) when you sit at a bar
I love UK's country side hobbit town, their pub culture, their music, their sport traditions, i love they hate because they're jealous, i love they always have to cheat or use boats to beat us
I love Dutch designer, their political progressivism (maybe i'm wrong on that, hard to say from abroad), their painters and that cheese, oh that cheese
I love how Spaniards seem to spend half their lives outside, and their crazy movie directors (they went full crazy after Franco i guess)
Aaaand i'd love Luxembourg to give the money back come on please we're broke so come on François rend l'argent
Finally i love you all accept us even though we're pretty fucked up as a Nation
Ha man I'm not even drunk but I love you all in ways that are hard to describe
Belgium : you guys are genuily nice, friendly, it's just hard not to feel at home there
I've never been big in capitals (and I despise ours, Paris) but yours I would move into in a heartbeat
Spain : well I mean to me it's family
And there's something about that too, I'm just so proud of my family, big, noisy, funny, so god damn loud did I already say that
But bloody amazing and just warm
Netherlands : you're a tough one to crack, had some tough years there, I struggled getting use to a few things there
Making friends there felt hard but boy if you put the effort, those friends are for life
England : country of my in laws and that always feel so diverse and accepting
At least to me you seem a lot more accepting than France
And
I like the way you work
Working in France with people not respecting meeting time and being late drives me through the wall
The others
I don't know you enough I'm sorry but still, I love you all except you Germany
(nah, just kidding, I'm starting to like you a lot too)
Belgium Beers
Santé les potos ! :)
German politics are not as delusional under illusion of splendor as ours
I also enjoy German people being more straightforward as we are; Freikörperkultur is also something i admire
I love how Italians are so surrounded with antiques they don't care anymore and someone ends up graffing something actually funny/clever on it
(i'm speaking about the low low end of antiques you can find - like an old shitty column or smth)
I love how Belgian work hard party hard
And  their old goofy artists you always end up talking to  (after 3 pints) when you sit at a bar
I love UK's country side hobbit town, their pub culture, their music, their sport traditions, i love they hate because they're jealous, i love they always have to cheat or use boats to beat us

Cheaper packs of smokes
Not gonna lie it's cool to see but it gets weary at times
That example with champagne is really a good one, happened to me multiple time in store ...
I mean why wouldn't we, we're fucking French
Lmao, in reality we regularly put "prout" (ie "fart") on trending on Twitter
EDIT : Just remembered that we broke the record for the largest-gathering of Smurfs while the Covid19 is still spreading
Guy on Reddit solve all Balkan's conflicts, 2020, coloutized
I kinda heard Gengis Khan's disapointed sigh from beyond the grave at that statement there
They're philosophical in their own, special way
>\* As if the French have sandwich fillings other than ham, cheese or ham and cheese
Tssssss
I know right
Très grande fierté
We could make a tradition to send our hated politicians in Spain ?
You guys took good care of Valls after all !
Goodbye Melenchon, no more Cult of Personnality for you
Marine le Pen
she’s pretty much the Trump of our country but she didn’t become president
Or we could send them BHL, Eric Zemmour, Michel Onfray or Michel Houellebecq
You're aware they're sending him back
I don't think you understand what the word democracy means, you probably mean "republic". The UK already *is* a democracy
You could wait her death (except if she is truly immortal), most people like *her* specifically, you will have way less trouble kicking the others out (just sayin')
I mean we'd be happy to pay for them if you keep them, we'd be graceful for it
^^^^Please
These four
Yep
Exactly
Add in Marion Maréchal Le Pen just for good measure
Alain Finkielkraut, Pascal Praud, Christophe Barbier
Wait, what ?! If the kids are being naughty they are sent to Spain ?
I mean he finalize his political suicide with you guys so that's that :)
Yep ! But idk, I would feel bad
Spain is nice, we don't want any of the Le Pen to ruin it
Damien Rieu, Dieudonné, Alain Soral, Daniel Conversano, Christine Boutin, Marguerite Stern, Cyril Hannouna
>you guys
I'm French too !
That'd be a good deal tbh
Imagine if you could send your worst politicians to another country ! We could make an EU+ exchange program !
And Apolline de Malherbe
I'm guessing this is a remnant of the 80 years war ?
Otherwise it's pretty damn strange
The flair didn't appear !
That's why the "+" was for, we can rename it if needed
Just nothing that would humiliate the kid
You are still getting a lot of freedom though
It's a bit different
If the name is going to hurt the child ("against the interest of the child"), the civil servant that register birth is allow to withhold registration and bring the case to a court/mediation's attention who will decide if, indeed, the name can hurt the child
The law doesn't specify what would exactly hurt a child but of course anything derogatory comes to mind
Also, names have to be in Roman letters with only French diacritics
We usely have several name at birth (each of them are equally our names) but once it's registered you practically can't change names, so better not go overboard
No laws but i remember a little scandal from one decade ago where there was a family named Renault exactly like the car brand, they got a daughter and wanted to name her Mégane or Zoé, I don't remember exactly, wich are models from the Renault brand and it was refused to them to avoid their child to be mocked for such name
A bit like this
And there are quite a number of gender neutral (to the ear) names in French, so the part about gendered names is a big no
Hell, our president is called Emmanuel
(Emmanuelle would be the girls’ name, pronounced in the exact same way
) We also have Claude & Claude, Pascal & Pascale, etc
A funny case we studied at uni : Aude Javel
For context, 'Eau de Javel' means bleach and is pronounced the same way as 'Aude Javel'. The parents didn't realize that and had already chosen the name, no ill intent whatsoever
The courts still ruled that the name was too hard to bear and ordered them to chose another one
And famously, no regional names using letters not usually found in French - still a big controversy in Brittany
For us too, tbh
Strangely, while the language is gendered, names aren't.
Most names have a specific gender expectation but some don't.
Anne used to be a masculine name in the long past
Some names go back and forth between being feminine and masculine like Camille
Some have been very common for both boys and girls at the same time like Dominique
Sans oublier Camille
Yeah, I think there was another case where the Renault family decided to call their daughter Megane like the car
really ? I though that kind of prohibition had been abolished
Consider yourselves lucky we no longer flog kids who speak regional languages in school
We got soft with you guys and that’s how we are repaid: with moaning and complaining
Isn't every name associated with a saint, or does that only work with the main ones
Or do you have a bunch of old roman/etruscan names that are lacking any corresponding saint
Anne used to be gender-neutral too
Yes, there were men named Anne
I have two married relatives called Pascal & Emmanuelle, or Pascale & Emmanuel, I never remember
Fun fact: there were probably jokes about his name in France too, because of the Jackie & Michel brand (all things sexy time brand)
[Here's a fresh summary]
ñ is the only one, and its status as non-French is debatable - it's used for some Spanish loanwords and the tilde was also used on vowels in old timey French
Ok that's hilarious
[And that concept has a name]
In France at least, Camille as a male name has become more popularized by world champion swimmer Camille Lacourt
But yeah, I was shocked to learn about Anne
I couldn't find any Belgian male Anne for you but it's also used in the Netherlands
French here
If I had to pick one among the hundreds if not thousands of museums we have
It would have the be Le Louvre
Musée d'Orsay is my personal favorite but there are so many incredible ones
Palais de Tokyo is my fav
Please do not listen to that obnoxious fredditor saying Musée d'Orsay (they never went, just want to sound posh and original)
Outside Paris you should visit Marseille's MUCEM, Lyon's musée des Confluences, or Centre Pompidou Metz (did i stutter ?)
As cliché as it sounds
I agree, it is a awe-inspiring experience
I LOVED visiting it
Couldn't agree more
Warsaw in particular has got some of the best offerings out there, which is quite a feat on a continent full of great museums
Les Invalides ? It wzs also very cool if that's whar you meant
Where does most of the art displayed at the Louvre come from then
Oh wait
Let me guess your answer
Italy
lol
I've read so many Italians complaining about the Mona Lisa being in the Louvre
Not our fault if Leonardo Da vinci sell it to François 1er
My father is near monolingual (speaks a little English, but not great), so mostly my parents used other tricks when I was a kid
However, since I have a sibling much, much younger than me, when my parents want to discuss something with me that they don't want him to hear, we switch to English, because me and my mother speak it
In front of my cousins, who are often preteens who start to grasp English, we use Spanish, with mixed results as no one in my close family is above decent at Spanish (except, of course, in front of the Spanish part of the family)
People may use English XD My mom used to do that when I was younger ("gifts" instead of "cadeaux")
If you happen to have a slightly higher level of English fluency than the average person (aka a better accent), odds are in your favor and you will probably not be understood (especially if you use fancy vocabulary)
This works wonderfully on children of course
I can't remember my parents did this to me, but my grandparents used complicated expressions, mostly from the countrysides to talk about subjects in front of us without worrying too much we could get it
This was mostly for things like OP said, desserts while we had a family dinner
My cousins however are English and just learning French, the younger ones are not yet bilingual so I guess it's a different and easier story for my grandmother, she can speak French in front of them
I'm not sure she is doing it regularly
I used to speak in English with my wife when we wanted to communicate without our young daughter to understand
I know people in my family switch to English for those things or spell the words letter by letter extremely fast
It happened through all my childhood
My parents would speak to each other in Alsatian dialect when they didn't want me to understand
When i was a little boy my parents talk sometime in english
Ofc i had no clue about what there were talking about so it seems efficient
There is no Dutch version of Pokémon
That's a real shame, and it's on Nintendo, again
Pokémon n'aurait pas une version en français non plus si un mec s'était pas amusé à tous les traduire
Ah il l'a fais gratuitement ? C'est même pas Nintendo France ou je sais pas quoi qu'a payer quelqu'un mais vraiment bénévolement ? Ben dis-donc
En fait je sais pas s'il a été payé mais il était employé chez Nintendo au Japon à l'époque et c'est lui qui a insisté pour pouvoir traduire les noms
Quel héro national
I feel so uncomfortable now because it seems like 50% of answers are “Please just speak English immediately” and 50% say “It’s rude to just launch into English and assume you’ll be understood” so like
what do I do
How to not be annoying
I’m socially awkward enough as it is but when I go *anywhere* I will frantically search for YouTube videos to teach me to say “Do you speak English please
” and “yes/no/sorry/thank you” in the local language and I won’t approach anyone without trying to ask first
If they ever say no to English (or French) I just have a panic attack and awkwardly go “ok, [sorry]
” and walk away dejectedly
Personally, I’m endlessly patient with language learners
I love it when people want to have a go
We’re not all lucky enough to have had comprehensive language education in school or been able to pay for private lessons so people *need* real situations to learn in
I never want anybody to feel like they’re foolish or burdensome (even if they are tbh)
I think French people really appreciate it if you try to speak in French with them
One thing that annoys me about tourists in Paris is when they just *assume* that I speak and understand English
I think the bare minimum is to first ask « Bonjour, parlez-vous anglais s'il vous plaît ? » (Hello, do you speak English please ?)
It helps (we appreciate that you take the time to learn, and try), but if it seems like the person you’re talking to wants to switch to English it’s ok to let them
It likely means that they have a hard time understanding you (I’m thinking about conversations with people you don’t know well: when asking for directions, at a restaurant/bakery, etc)
If you can't handle a conversation, then don't. I know we French are known for being bad at English, but this is a much better option than having to guess what you're trying to say (whereas everyone knows a few basic English words)
It's not annoying if you can make sentences (the accent doesn't really matter if you know the grammar)
But the thing is, most people overestimate their language skills
If you're trying to improve, maybe the batista at a crowded café or the random passerby aren't the best choices
(they don't have either the time or the patience)
To be honest, seeing the level French people have in English and witnessing the level tourists have in French, it's just a mess all around
Sure it helps, even just a few words, it shows they respect our country (plus no one speaks English here)
I feel you
Every time I travel to a new country I try to learn at least the very basics : hello/thank you / sorry / goodbye
And sometimes a random sentence, it’s always fun to break the ice
Regarding tourists in France, perhaps it’s because it’s my standard, I’m expecting them to at least try
We will catch pretty easily if you can or cannot handle the conversation
If I’m working and you want to practice now, if I’ve got the time I’ll speak with you in french, even help you find the right word
If I’m a bit in a hurry I’ll most probably node and smile but won’t further the conversation
I’m also used to saying hello in every shop I enter, to both the clerk and the security officer
Same on my way out, I’ll say goodbye and bid them a good day
So I would find rude someone who is not answering back if I was the one working (not working atm, but if you enter my shop and don’t answer my bonjour back, I will say it endlessly until you answer
I am not your dog, a minimum of humanity goes a long way)
Would seem pretty rude tbh
Sauf que personne parle anglais ici faut être honnête
Ne úgy beszélj, mintha minden magyar beszél angolul :D
Ami egyáltalán nem az igazság
Úgy tűnik, hogy mindenki nálatok azt gondolja, hogy ez a világ legnehezebb nyelve, de egyszerűbben tanulok magyarul, mint pl
japánul
The potatoe in the mouth
If there is one, the person tries to get the best accent
If there isn't, it's a stroke (or a native speaker)
That's not something to be proud of
Tanulj tanulj
Don't take it personnally if people reply in English
Most of the time, they're just as happy to speak English as you are to speak French
Also chances are they think they're helping you by switching to a language you might speak better
Yeah asking in English is fine too !
I’m sorry if that’s the case
Some Parisians can be real assholes
Mind you they’re not only rude to tourists
Because it's Paris, where people are most of the time in hurry and encounter plenty of tourists everywhere
I think if you talked in french to shop owners or servers they switched to english in order to go quickly on what you want exactly and move on to another customer
Pretty sure if you went into a group of youths in Paris or to shop owners in a smaller town, they would took the time to talk in french with you
But yea, Paris is pretty much tail or face, even for natives from regional areas parisians people seems rude and constantly annoyed
That’s sad :( I wish my fellow compatriots were not like that
Perhaps they thought they were helping .... if it can reassure you we are mean toward each other
French tend to be bad at foreign languages cause we just judge each other abilities all the fucking time ...! We do that in french too, correcting each other grammar
I think it’s just impolite to immediately start speaking to citizens of a country in another language
We are not a theme park with the red carpet rolled out for you
En vrai je pense que pas mal de monde parle au moins des rudiments d’anglais (voire parle très bien pour certains !) mais n’ose pas parce que l’accent et l’oral c’est _dur_, haha
On n’est pas assez entraînés à la prise de parole, mais on se débrouille :)
Englantia*, no
Can agree, it's very disrespectful if you don't greet people you meet here
Nincs kutyám?
Yeah that's what I said
I think the rude aspect was to say hello in the local language and not giving more information on how you would like the conversation to go on (native or English)
Meeting halfway means learning the follow string of vocabularies in French : hello, excuse me, do you think french, please, thank you
I don’t think it’s that hard, but then again I’m already french so who know
I guess french people are more sensitive to preserving their language, and do not like the global dominance of English
I think the two situations are quite different
The French speakers are a minority in Canada, and some feel they are being oppressed for that
So for them, it is a question a standing a ground, defending their culture and identity
In France, I feel like we havent integrated that French isn't a lingua franca anymore (if ever be), and as european citizen we are expected to have a certain level in English
I think it boils down to "you can speak one of your languages when you come to us, so I should be able to speak one of mine (even if it is my only one and my mother tongue) when I come to you".
So in Canada, it is a society issue, while in France many are just bad at foreign language, and because of our history some may feel a bit entitled so they wouldn't do the necessary efforts
I may be totally wrong, but it was my impression
Idk I've just learned that you have to use partitive when talking about languages but I may be wrong
En général les gens aiment pas discuter en anglais quand même
Nem értem semmit xd
It's a problem when you have as much English speakers as Norwegian speakers
Bah ça dépend
Moi j'aime bien parce que je suis à l'aise
Maintenant je n'apprécie pas trop quand un mec m'aborde et commence à me demander un truc sans saluer, en anglais ou français
I’m not sure french is declining on the world stage with African countries growing demographically
Maybe french spoken in France but french language has always been seen as universal
In France the debate is substituting English expressions when there are perfectly good french words to use
Younger, urban people don’t seem to see this as a problem
In a more general sense, French identity is deeply rooted in three institutions: the State, the memory of the French Revolution and the French language
My guess is that when french people, consuming Anglosaxon cinema, reading Anglosaxon books, following Anglosaxon politics, start seeing their own language as boring or lame, it’s a big part of French national identity that is being threatened for some people
Les trois-quarts des gens que je connais ne sont pas capables de tenir une conversation
Érdekes
Never told it was bad to speak it, I said it was bad when it exceeds the number of people speaking your official language
Oui je comprends ça. Après je vis en région parisienne donc je vois plein de touristes, et je bosse majoritairement en anglais avec des clients et fournisseurs de partout donc ça ne me dérange pas
Si ça se passe dans un coin pas très touristique j'imagine que c'est pas la même
I would hope the smell of a nice fresh butter croissant
Lavender, fresh baguette, and dear god I hope not the Parisian métro stations
If I wanted to show a good aspect of France i would say wine on top of it
If i wanted to be realistic i would say just take a smelly socks and some rotten milk in the fridge, mix those two and feel weak because France has a lot of eddible things that smells far worse than this mix
(for instance [Andouillette] or all those nice kind of cheese like the [Munster cheese] )
The European ideal is great
But in this specific case I am afraid it would be better to put France on its own separate board, or you won't be able to smell most other countries
Or IDK, maybe some channel #5 can compensate the smell of a nice maroilles
Interesting olfactive combination, I'm curious now
This is why I said "I would hope"!
That's pretty accurate, I personally smell of garlic, cheese, onions with a touch of peppermint to hide the alcohol and the cigarette
I'm sure my wife who's not French actually love it
I have lived 17 years in Paris and for me, Paris smell is the metro smell: piss and burnt rubber
The cheese you shall not touch barehanded, or else thee fingers will rot and withers
The town I grew up went from ~10
000 inhabitants in the 70's and constantly decreasing to ~6
500 today
The weirdest part is everything is clearly too big for the city, and subsequently badly maintained
The cool side is that I could watch two controlled demolition as a kid and that was a blast
My native town in South France has barely any people under 40 living there because the few teens leave for school all week long, the adults work in the big city nearby all day long and only come back in the evening
It's so depressing
Where is that town
Yes, it should
It would give users a break plus induce better quality products, give police a break to focus on severe matters (we've got plenty atm), empty court rooms & prisons, provide VAT and business taxes, provide a new market for tobacconists (a dying profession), most probably diminish the appeal towards it among teenagers (happened in other countries) and draw lots of people out of the illegal business
It would also diminish the impact of drug dealers on places where they are omnipotent lords now
It's been fought against for decades by politicians who don't understand what's going on and what's at stake, usually confusing pot with heroin
Yes, legalise it
France has the highest cannabis usage in Europe despite it being illegal
Ridiculous amounts of money are spent on drug war yet it's ineffective and ridiculous amounts of money are made from cannabis sale
In Russia it's difficult to get drugs as most people try to get it through the darkweb and it's controlled by police so people tend to resort to easy to make synthetic drugs such as Krokodile(Heroin on steroids) [Spice] which looks like cannabis but just destroys your body really, really fast and can kill you pretty easily
Surprisingly this drug was actually legal for some time and sold in Kiosks
Imagine how much profit the government would make if they legalised it and how much it would reduce the risks of people resorting to other, potentially dangerous drugs
I think it should carry very little criminal weight, but I’m not sure I’m entirely pro-legalization
Three main reasons:
It’s very difficult to accurately measure when someone has last been smoking which makes it impossible to control while driving
That’s a big issue imo
If it’s legal it will be smoked more in public places, apartments and so on and weed REEKS
Not sure I would want to legitimize what I personally consider to be a huge public nuisance
Weed presents strong health risks, especially for teenagers but for the population at large
If it is legal it will be easier to buy especially for minors, just like alcohol and cigarettes is
Weed is very dangerous for brain development
Aside from teenagers, weed can be a trigger for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in some individuals, and I feel like this risk is understated
Is it really worth it
Imo, medical marijuana could be a good first step, and in the meantime more studies should be done, and ways to detect it in blood, breath etc
developed
Cannabis shouldn't be legalized, majiruana should be legalized
There's so much bad mix of cannabis that it's horrible for the health, there's also the one that have a too strong thx
I'm absolutely against it because drugs are a vice that perverts people
It is a dangerous substance that destroys health and causes a lot of violence by its production
Yes, people should be able to grow, possess, and use cannabis on private property
Legalized but with strong regulation, like other legalized stupefiants like ethanol and tobacco
I prefer that market to be in the hands of lawful industries and under state scrutiny rather than under the radar ran by thugs
If people abuse drugs, there is usually a social problem to address, drug usage being a symptom
10€ in France the packets of cigarettes, at this price it's racket :/
Agreed it's so fucking retarded
Cannabis is extremely hard to get in Russia because everything goes through the darkweb, so people started resorting to synthetic drugs like Spice (some toxic shit that looks like weed but that kills you) or even worse, "homemade" drugs or fucking Krokodil
It's totally understandable considering the costs tobacco causes to healthcare
I grew up in France in a city next to Geneva and in Switzerland they don't say "soixante-dix" but "septante". The first time I heard that, I was sure that the Swiss are some kind of rebels and they decided to quit France and create their own country just because they didn't want to learn the 'corret' numbers
When I was young, I thought Cambodia was an African country because in French the name is Cambodge and it sounded very close to African countries' name to me
When I was younger, I thought that Slovenia and Slovakia were where the Baltic countries are, and that they were a whole country that got separated for unknown reasons
How silly I was
Portugal was never Spain Portugal has always been frindly with Galicia and the entire Spain
It is Madrid who enjoys to create fights for dominance and subject Portugal to speak spanish
Portugal does have the most fertile lands on the Iberian Peninsula
Portugal is 300 years older than Spain
Portugal was never Spain even when Portugal was ruled by a Spanish monarchy for 60 years
Holland and other European countries were also ruled by the Spanish Monarchy but it was never Spain /s
Among those i know, I’d say Dublin, Paris, Naples, Ljubljana, Riga
Edit : Or Lisbon, Carcassonne, Hamburg, Prague, Budapest
Lisbon, Carcassonne, Prague, Moscow (cities I personally want to visit)
We don't do it when it would be clear in context, which is the case here
I mean compared to those two everything is ok
Always go for lavazza qualità rossa
Call me weird but I make it in bulk and store my coffee in the fridge to put it in my cereal or latte macchiato freddo
My favorite that I can get my hands on easily is "Pfaff" a French one, can be found is some place specialized in coffee or some supermarket if the owner like coffee and get into the trouble of commanding some high quality
The best I ever drank is either one from Genoa or surprisingly enough one from a small "roastery" in Osaka, Japan (which expect this one place, is definitely not the place where I'd recommend drinking coffee)
Is it milled or in coffee beans ?
It sounds odd but special k milk coffee and a chopped up banana is my go-to breakfast
A healthy dose of Horse tranquilliser to start the day never hurt nobody
Dated and now married to a brit
Coming from a Spanish family and growing up in France, my main difficulty has been getting used to the eating habits
We take our time, food is very important to us and so is sharing where for him it's really about being done with it
The only meal that takes time has got to be the Sunday roast otherwise
Meh
With the years we've learned to adapt to both cultures and meals are now a bit of both of us but I think he still struggles when we end up going to my family and the meal stars at 2pm and ends at 10pm of we're lucky
I'm Colombian and my partner is French
While there are many differences between both cultures, its been an awesome ride to (re)discover the world through each other
Yes ! Although than can also cause misunderstanding sometimes, culture difference is a great thing, and we can talk about it for hours
Understanding the world from multiple perspectives is great for the relationship, that kinda creates a close relationship between the two
The farthest the country, the more the difference you'll notice
To anyone who never tried talking to anyone outside of EU, please do, you'll learn a lot
I'm a french girl and I'm almost her complete opposite XD  don't let her go
Ahah that is quite the stereotype indeed
Don't let her go, she seems like a keeper, enven for French standards
Can confirm
Bienvenue, mon frère
Let me guess, you dont speak a word of french
>In the Uk it’s really not all that special to have a threesome
*buys ticket to the nearest UK airport*
Germans be like let's eat dinner at 5
21h is a bit late for most French homes imo
19h30/20h would be a better fitting meal time
Anyway, 21h is still better than fucking 18h! Who's hungry at that time
Is this the US or Europe
Edit: guess what I changed
Can't tell if crazy early or crazy late xD
That's the usual time for a lot of people here even a little bit too late, more like 8-9pm
But I think 6pm is way too early for a lot of French people
At which time do you eat in Germany ?
Same, apart from "loves to use loads of onions, garlic, cheese and butter" lmao
I'm currently learning Italian
Is there something I should be careful about (if that makes sense) when learning ?
Yeah, between 7 and 8 is usually dinner time for me, not really 9
Vowel length, doubled consonants, and accentuation (stress)
> Waiting for that until 1-2 hours before going to bed wouldn't make sense to me
Well, this last sentence depends on what time do you go to sleep
I personally won't go to sleep before midnight/1a.m. So I've got plenty of time before I got to sleep
Amazing
Wdym lol
Thank you for your answer !!
What are the most comic "unfortunate language mistakes" that non native speakers make in your language
Some in French are famous ( and hilarious ):
"Merci beaucoup"="thanks a lot" , sounds like "merci bocu" with English accent, and means "thanks nice ass" ( beau cul )
Don't translate "I am hot" literally from English, "Je suis chaud" can mean "I am horny"…
Another mistake that English speakers, especially Americans, make a lot:
"I'm excited" doesn't translate as "Je suis excité", which means "I'm aroused". We would rather say "I can't wait for", and we don't even use that one much
There was an interesting [BBC Travel post] some years ago about the difficulties of an American to understand this seemingly lack of excitement of the French people
She makes some interesting observation about the French language and its relation to our way of life
In French, don't translate "I will introduce myself" (Je vais m'introduire) literally from English, It can be very sexual
This had me laughing way too much
I kinda hop someone asks me for food “without préservatifs” one day
(Psst, just a side note: the French word is “conservateur” -same as conservative people in Parliament, yes)
>conservatif
Conservateur
>les nourritures americains sont fait
La nourriture américaine est faite :)
Thanks for the link, it’s a real interesting point of view
As a French I had never given it much thoughts, so
TIL
At some point I thought that the author was going to speak of that French speaking about differences between French and American people: we sometimes say that Americans are like peaches -open and easy going, they’ll easily speak and laugh with you, but the core of their being is very private and only for their close friends to enjoy; while French people would be walnuts -hard to crack (break the ice with), but once you’ve made it inside you’ve got access to their whole being
This is another take on our differences, but one that I find it interesting as well
Any American here to confirm/reject this point of view
Ahah
Remind me an other one:
My mother once meet an american girl named joy at her church
She translate her name to my mother "fille de joie" (girl of joy) but this is a polite way to say prostitute ...
Apparently they use "Ça m’enthousiasme", but we would need a French-speaking Canadian to confirm
"foot" is never used to refer to the ball though
Kinda yeah
Yes, "baiser" is "to kiss" in an old fashioned way, but now it means to fuck
The way to greet is "la bise" and not la baise, so be careful ahah
Sounds like you had great time
Yes a lot of French don't eat foie gras because of the animals suffering
I guess so
I mean, if it wasn't with the USA and internet, I wouldn't know what millenials are and that we (apparently) hate baby boomers for ruining the economy
I don't think I've heard the term "millenials" in french
Not even sure how you'd say it, Les millénaires ?
It's not as visible as in the US, but generations exist here too
We have the generation which remembers WW2 and might have had a political role in it, or at least grew up during WW2 ; the boomers ; the last generation that grew up without Internet - was (almost) old enough to vote on 9/11 - remembers at least vaguely the Gulf War and the USSR ; the generation that grew up with Internet (born in the late 80s or later)
We're just far less obsessed with labeling our generations, but politically, they matter a lot as every generations votes differently
They do matter to politicians, but are much less visible because we don't label, categorize and divide everything like the US do these days
We don't like to label everything, because it causes deep societal divisions and some kind of dangerous "us vs them" ideology
We've had enough "us vs them" with WW2 and the Cold War, we're tired of it and we don't want that again
Also our generations don't strictly match the American generations due to different local politics and technology
TL;DR : generations don't really matter here outside of politics
Never in heard about generations like that in Europe, but I've heard someone from Australia use those (in a youtube video I think) so maybe it's not entirely limited to the US
It's unfortunately seeping with the help of social networks, especially in woke "hip" circles
Mostly related to housing and environmental issues
I think that in this case It says more about the person complaining because It's deeply ignorant of the issues they had
The older people harbour much less hostility toward younger generations than in America (or at least much less than what redditors seem to describe) and were much more likely to live in what most would consider severe poverty nowadays (no running water, poor insulation, literal slums around big cities etc
) at the time of their youth
The older people tend to have vastly different views, having voting patterns that differ heavily from their younger counterparts (notably, they vote a lot more for the establishment right wing party "Les Républicains")
But they're more like what you call the "silent generation" and very old "boomers" that weren't nearly as prosperous as young americans since wartime privations were very real and France was indeed quite poor till the end of the 50s for this reason
We really only have the 68-ards, it's oyr boomers, but even that isn't that common
There is les soixante-huitards
It is a thing
I don't think we have any equivalent in French, though I've heard many kids talk about "les 2001", "les 2002". Saying stuff like, 2001 are still okay, but 2002 are the worst
pretty stupid IMO
[Génération Y.]
Right off the bat, I'd say whatever is below La Défense (major business district)
It is said that some weird stuff happen in the basement, like satanic rituals etc
I think it's a popular urban legend amongst Parisians but I'm not that well informed about haunted places (since I'm not foolish enough to look for them lol) so I hope you get more conclusive answers for France
Les Catacombes de Paris are also quite creepy
Ooh, you're totally right
It was such an obvious answer but I totally forgot they existed lol ty
Is it that hard for you not to swear while you're in another country
Depends on the context
The only ones I can think if in french are "[à] (at, to, in, until depending on the context) and "a" (has for the singular third person)
There's also [y] (here, there, about it)
There are also transitions letters ("Il y a-**t**-il ... ?") and conctracted letters in front of vowels ("de" becomes "d'" : "Je suis content **d'**avoir ...")
But most of the one letter words depend on context
They don't mean anything by themselves
There are quite a few in french:
-a which is the verb "avoir" at the third person, ex : il a (he has)
-à a preposition which more or less means at
-y which doesn't really mean anything but is used ex : il y a (there is)
Then there are lot of contraction I don't know if it counts as words, like:
c' (contraction of ce)
l' (contraction of le)
m' (contraction of me)
n' (contraction of ne)
SPANISH
A - to
E - and, when the next word begins with i
O - or
U - or, when the next word begins with o
Y - and
FRENCH
à - to/at
y - location pronoun
A is a form of the verbal Have, only in the case of "He/She Have", "Il/Elle a"
And, if it means to, in or of in some contexts, then we have à
a (have with he/she/it), à (at, in), l' ("the" before a word which starts by a vowel), t' (ex : "je t'aime" which eans i love you), c' ("c'est" means it is), j' ("I" before a verb which starts by a vowel)
and our longest word (bc i saw comments about that) is "anticonstitutionnellement" which is an adverb which means "against the constitution"
True
Even though the main occurence of it I can think of is in Astérix, when talking to some authority ([for example]
Oh that's great
I don't really pay attention to grammar, I was pretty bad in French class
It's nice having words to describe it haha
Same here in France, you don’t tell people how much you make, and you don’t ask either
I think it depends more on the people you're talking to rather than the country you're living in
My experience with it had been a bit odd
Whenever I asked my parents they were almost frightful like “why do you need to know
” “Who’s asking
” etc
And they never gave me a real number just general approximations
In France it's a little taboo among the older generation, i share it without bragging about it
I think if you earn minimum wage, there is no taboo
If you are a cashier at a supermarket, everyone has a vague idea you get minimum wage, give or take
Now if you brag about earning 100k/year, in France you're considered a dick
I never encountered that, I know what people in my family make and all my friends too, it's not taboo at all
Yeah, it's somewhat of a taboo, don't exactly understand why though
Je dirais que ça dépend des gens
I've noticed it can go both ways here in Germany, some people just talk about it openly and some others seem unconfortable about the topic
I must say my Bavarian husband is brutally straight and has zero problems talking or asking about money matters, so perhaps people engage in fight or flight mode lol
True, but in France even a cashier can make a bit more money with the “primes” system, which is like a bonus; you get those if you live a bit far from the workplace, if you have kids, if you’ve been working there for more than 3 years
On top of that, if you work more than your 35h/week, you’re getting paid more, you get what’s called the “heures sup’”, which can range between 5% to 50%+ of your hourly wage
For these reason, it’s a bit more complicated to just guess how much money someone is actually making
Sure, but would you ask someone you just met how much they make ? Often times, you need to be friend with the person
Because if you're rich people will demonstrate against you
>On top of that, if you work more than your 35h/week, you’re getting paid more, you get what’s called the “heures sup’”, which can range between 5% to 50%+ of your hourly wage
>For these reason, it’s a bit more complicated to just guess how much money someone is actually making
Alright, point taken
But there is no way a cashier is making 100k/year, regardless how many 'heure sup'
Of course not but that's just common decency
I never saw it like that, but now that you say it, it makes sense
It’s also cultural
I currently live in Canada and everytime i meet a new person, we always come to talk about our jobs and how much we make within the first 15 minutes of encounter
You rarely see that in notre patrie
I see, I didn't except this to be a thing somewhere, good to know
Here in France, most of the "black" olives we found are marinated, not ripe
I only ever see black olives on pizza, I think (I don't like them so I'm not exactly an expert), but green olives are a common appetizer
In Provence they mostly make green olives but I only like Greek style black olives
Also, most of the black olives are used for pizza and the green olives are normally for appetizers or things like these
That's why there's a lot of green olives and less black ones
Not a rock, a giant ice cube
France isn't really a semi presidential country anymore, at least since the 2000 referendum
The presidential term in office was lowered to five years instead of seven, and parliament elections now happen just a month after the president is elected
So PR and PM have been from the same party for 20 years now, giving the President almost full control over the institutions
Wasn't the case before with the "cohabitations" other redditors explained
FWIW, "presidential regime" is a misleading term
It doesn't mean "a regime where the president has all the power", because if you look at the US regime (which is the posterchild for presidential regimes), the president is arguably much less powerful than in a "semi-presidential" regime like France, because Congress has a lot of power to block him
Even the British PM really is more powerful (in his own country I mean) than the US president sometimes, as long as he can hold his majority
The difference between "presidential" and "parlimentary" is a question of how the separation of powers between legislative and executive is organized
In a presidential regime, it is strictly enforced (at least in theory): Congress can't overthrow the President (impeachment is a judiciary process and requires crime, as opposed to mere political disagreement), and the President can't dissolve Congress, the most he can do is veto bills
By contrast, the separation of powers in a parlimentary regime is soft: in the UK, the House of Commons very much makes or breaks governments, and the Prime Minister can call for legislative elections at any time
So the legislative can overthrow the chief of the executive (the PM), and vice versa
Meanwhile, you have a head of State (the Queen in the UK and in other constitutional monarchies, presidents in many other countries like Germany), with very little power outside of major constitutional crises
If we look at France, it is technically a parlimentary regime
But four years into it, De Gaulle used a referendum (a dubious process constitutionally from the start) to make the presidential election a direct universal suffrage election
This, along with De Gaulle's personal charisma and place within the political climate of the time, made the President the actual chief of the executive, which completely imbalanced the system, because he now has direct democratic legitimacy, which tends to trump indirect legitimacy (through the legislative branch)
Now, the executive can still impact the legislative (the President can dissolve the National Assembly), but the legislative can only act on the PM (by overthrowing him), who's not the real chief of executive power
The legislative has exactly 0 power over the President, even less than Congress in the US
As another poster explained, this state of things was further cemented in 2000 when the legislative elections were scheduled to always take place right after the presidential elections, which ensures that a President will always have a majority in the legislative branch (because people don't change their minds that much in a month)
So in our case, the PM is basically a glorified manager
This has worsened in the past two decades, with the newly-minted PM being a virtually unknown technocrat as opposed to a well-known politician with a certain stature, as was the case before
There is no balance, if the PM is of the same party as the president, then the president have full power, if he's not, then the PM can block pretty much everything the president does
There is no balance
The president have full powers
The ministers are just aides to the president
Good question and good timing
In France, the recent nomination of Jean Castex as the prime minister highlights a fundamental problem with our republic : the president is extremely powerful
Not even talking about the executive power controlling both the judiciary and the legislative, leaving us with a parody of what we're taught as "democracy".
In parliamentary regimes, the PM holds the power and the parliament counterbalances it
In presidential regimes, such as the US, there is no PM, but there are other means for the legislative power to counterbalance
In France, the PM only acts as a fuse in case the parliament gets pissed
Which happens pretty much never, since the parliament gets elected one month after the president, which always guarantees him a comfortable majority and removes the need to negociate to create a presidential majority
For french speakers, this twitter thread is a very good explanation as to why France is fucked :
France has a disproportional amount of power, if not all of it, vested in the president
Up to 2002 there did happen to be presidents and prime ministers of opposing parties, in which case the prime minister ended up with most power to govern
However, since 2002 legislative elections happen 1 month after presidential elections, which means that these elections take place during the president-elect's peak of popularity, which tends to produce high results for his party
This means the PM will always be aligned with the president, and generally tends to be in service of the president
Then there is our parliament, the national assembly, I mentioned that its elections happen 1 month after the presidential elections, so normally it would be packed with representatives from the president's party
However, it has happened that that majority was a lot more slim, and it became possible at times that a law might not pass (eg the "loi travail") in which case the president and PM can use article 49-3 of the French constitution whose effect is that a law is passed into law without a vote from any of the representatuve bodies
There is also the senate, which is elected by some few tens of thousands of people who held elected offices of any kind
The senate tends to be more conservative, not just in the social way (for example most of its representatives still belong to LR and the PS, two parties that are now a minority in the national assembly) however it's also subordinate to the national assembly
The senate does have the power to launch investigations into the president and his governement, which does help a bit
The constitutional court which is like our Supreme court is elected 1/3 by the president and 1/3 by parliament, so you would think it'd be very pro-president, but surprisingly it has mostly done its job of censoring laws that go against the principles of the French constitution
Finally there's other elections like municipal elections and European elections which do have some influence on the governement and serve as a thermometer of the French electorate, however do not change the president's politics much
This is also why French people tend to protest, strike and riot a lot
Considering how unrepresentative the institutions are, often French people exert political influence through protests, strikes and riots
Tl;dr In France separation of powers is there in theory but a farce in reality, the president has all powers
From a french standpoint it's quite clear :
* President is giving the directions and priorities
* Government is implementing it through laws/rules
Now that's the official story ... reality is that it depends of the president, the prime minister, the topic, the media pressure, the current polls
The president is overpowered now compared to the PM but usually I'd say 75-25
France being "semi presidential" is a bit of a joke, tbh
> For french speakers, this twitter thread is a very good explanation as to why France is fucked :
I don't like that thread
It makes 3 claims:
- The PM is just a subordinate to the president (that's perfectly true)
- This is getting worse (that's not true: Pompidou was a nobody as well when he was nominated PM)
- That's a bad thing (that's highly debatable, and there's not much argumentation towards that in the thread)
Yes, they're elected directly (the MPs through a two round majority system)
It's totally possible for another party to win parliament elections after the President, but  it never happens in practice
The turnout for presidential elections is  very high by French standards (75 to 80%) and this legitimacy is key
So typically the President's party wins the parliament elections as the turnout falls to 50%, because every leader gets some kind of momentum
Chances are near to 0, legislative elections are barely 2 months after the president gets elected, when he'll be at the height of his popularity, he cannot lose the legislatives, only way I could see it happening is if the far right wins the presidential election, and I'm not even 100% sure they would lose the legislatives anyway
It being a bad thing is hardly debatable
The only people debating it are those who support the current president, because he essentially has all powers, and these supporters change with every new president
The thread's author has an extensive knowledge of constitutional law, and nothing there is subjective
Also, for Pompidou : sure, but that's really not the point there, and he had been de Gaulle's right-hand man for years, and a member of the Constitutional Council, before being appointed PM
In this case the Sejm pretends to listen to the president for a minimal amount of time (just enough to appease the public opinion), and then they do whatever they, or rather whatever one sad,old, angry bachelor from Żoliborz, please anyways
> and he had been de Gaulle's right-hand man for years
Which makes it way worse: he was deffinitly appointed as a subordinate to the president
> The only people debating it are those who support the current president, because he essentially has all powers
I think most people want a president who's able to act, rather than balances and restraint
That may be undemocratic, but most people are more anti-tyranny than pro-democracy
In Paris, not anymore, I guess
In the 90s any kid aged 8/9 and up would go and come back from school independently, and stay at home alone for an hour or two, but these days I see almost no elementary school kid without an adult and even middle schoolers get dropped off
That's said, parents take their kid by bus, metro or even scooter those days, cars are still very inconvenient
16th century+ French: some vocabulary issues but mostly no problem
older French: nope
but medieval latin, yes, so i have that going for me
There is a few words that I can understand but the rest is completely unreadable
Very accurate summary
I don’t read latin, though (medieval or not), so I have to stick to translations -of Latin & of old French
> It's not easy but you can definitely understand the general gist of the story
Or not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I really only got small fragments of a "strory". Like I understand there's a dog and an ewe
But that's basically it
It talks of death at a point but I'm incapable to say if the ewe did die or not
That's really it
Don't understand anything else
I learned classical latin in school as well as medieval latin in university
We only learnt one pronunciation, meant to be a "new" one, with "c" pronounced as "k"
"Actually" sounds like "actuellement" but means "en fait" (≈ "in fact), and I heard a lot of people pronounce the word "rap" "rape"
I would say that most French people get confused with the fact that police is plural in English (singular in French), whereas information is always singular in English, and can be and often is plural in French
Probably "I am agree".
In French,  you grammatically don't "agree" with someone but "are in agreement" with someone ("être d'accord avec quelqu'un)
Actually vs actuellement (an adverb) meaning "right now, nowadays"
Here too we "make" photos
According to this thread, every european makes the same mistakes in English . We do this with shooting, parking, camping ...
Same in France
Nope
[Always singular]
Nouns with no singular
>'The police are coming
The police are coming
' (They)
>Some nouns in English are collective
They represent a group or number of objects together
In many cases, these nouns are considered plural: they are collections of single pieces kept together
Because of this, they take a plural verb and have no singular noun form
Same in French, something _has_ sense for us
"Ça a du sens" is our "it makes sense".
But the English phrasing is starting to stick: lots of French people now say "ça fait sens", which is the literal translation of the English "it makes sense".
We can also say "prendre une photo" (lit
take a photo) but it's slightly less common
We use the same word for make and do so it's work as well
"Prendre une photo" is not only correct but widely used
It even sounds more natural to me than "Faire une photo" but I guess it's a matter of preference, or maybe region
Really
I would have said the opposite
"Faire une photo" sounds a bit weird to me
Regional differences maybe
(I'm from Paris)
Same in French (actuellement)
Well, we have fancy grammar but a poor sense of it
I hate it when people say « ça fait sens », but they do
"Faire une photo" is definitely more common here
"Here" being
En Lorraine
I was drunk in a nightclub in London
A dude didn't know how to dance the maccarena, so aften laughing at him several minutes (I was drunk),  I teached him the choreography
Later, we went together in the smokehouse to take a cigarette, and began the presentations
We talked in English like
20 minutes
And at one moment, he said  "but, you are French too !"
Yep, not very interesting story
Not especially funny, but this winter, in Reykjavík... I was chasing the Northern Lights and went at the edge of town to that lighthouse (Reykjavík residents might now where I'm talking about)
Quite a lot of people there but all in groups, and I came across the only other solo guy
We started talking in english, almost yelling through the wind
aaand it took me just a few seconds to notice his accent (note: I dont have an accent when speaking english) so, well
*"Ok, t'es français, vas-y, laisse tomber l'anglais alors, mec !"*
Usually, you can spot the Frenchs with the accent, it's quite easy
I'm French but I have been living in Amsterdam for a while
A few months ago, a friend of mine launched her online sex shop and she invited all her friends to party in Bordeaux, in France
Before going back there, I decided to get her dick and vagina-shaped candies from one of the touristy shops in the center of Amsterdam
So I find a shop on Hoogstraat, typical touristy shop with nutella waffels in the window and stuff
I go straight to the dick and vagina candies and fill a bag with them
When I go to the counter to pay, the clerk looks at my bag and smirks
Then, he says "These are quite popular among tourists". I recognize he has an accent but I'm not quite sure, so I answer in English with my thick French accent that I actually live here
He recognizes my accent and switches to French instantly
Turns out he came from Bordeaux, the very city I was travelling to
We chatted a bit, he gave me a few bar recommendations
Very nice dude
But alors you are French
Just alsace problems
Oh yes
I've been to supermarkets in small towns near the border where the cashiers greet you in German until you give them a sign that you'd actually rather speak French, because there are so many German customers crossing the border to buy stuff (very specific stuff, like bottled water)
Yes, but there are a lot of bilingual people
My boyfriend, who is a hotel manager, had a really difficult time finding a job in his area in Alsace because he does not speak German
Granted, hotels have a lot of German-speaking customers, but still, it's a little surprising especially considering he speaks English and Spanish fluently too
We did not expect not speaking German to be an actual issue, but it can be, in Alsace
Ours are huge
I wish they would make them the size of a debit card which would be much easier to fit them anywhere when travelling
Oh, and [they also look terribly fake]  (basically a plastified paper)
[Carte d'identité]
It just shows classic sex, DOB and height
In france the miscelaneous information would be : Size, eyes color, birth place
Just some indication to help police to figure out if it is really you
As France is very serious about laicity, we would never gather information about religion
We do
Besides name and date and place of birth, it shows gender, size, address at which you reside
And of course, there's your picture on it
Yes we have ID cards but they aren't mandatory
Though most people have one because it's quite useful
They look like [that]
I was actually quite baffled when I learned last week that not every country has one
Starting 2021, IDs will have credit card format IIRC
also they're peak 90s design
My bad
Oh my last sentence wasn't in a negative way
It was just something I grew up with so I never thought it was something some countries don't have
But it made me think about what does it implies to have one, especially about police ID checks
And let me tell you they suck a lot here in France
No need to look it up to say it'd be Paris/Paris/Paris/Paris/Paris
&#x200B;
For the second biggest, it was probably Marseille in 1600 and 1700, and Lyon ever since, though depending on how you count, it could be Marseille again
In France there is this sentence : "Paris and the rest".
I think this will answer your question
Naoned(Nantes) all the way for Brittany and Paris for france
I started in school when I was 10 but was godawful until around 16 when I started watching anime with english subs and gradually got better, in like 6 months I went from worst of my class to top 3
I learned the grammar in School, use to read a lot of translation of english music as a teen
Then i started to watch Rupaul's Drag race but i couldnt found subtitles so i forced myself to watch as it is and now i can understand easily english
Speaking it is tougher though, my accent is terrible
I started learning English around 11, and while school was useful to gain some knowledges, I really improved thanks to harry potter
I had previously read dozens of time each of the book in French, when I decided I wanted I wanted to try to read them in English
After that I found out about Audiobook and fell in love with
Jim Dale version of HP (he is a fantastic storyteller), and because I knew them more or less by heart, I think my brain was able to kind of guess the vocabulary I was missing
The only problem with that methodology is that I understand way better than I can speak, but otherwise I think it as a very good passive way of learning
It was during the summer before my last year of middle school
I was browsing through Wikipedia, and realized the English version of the article I was reading had more information
I thought "Uh
Would be neat to learn English
" Then I forced myself to watch English YouTube videos with French subtitles, then afterwards English, and then without them entirely
I also read Wikipedia articles in English and would use translation websites when I didn't know words
Started at 11 I wasn't good
Then my penny's could afford to send my in a host family that didn't speak anything else than English for 6 weeks 3 years in a row and I became much better
Picked up the basics in school at around 10 then really got into it at around 13 with youtube
I learned English when I was 5 because I used to live in NYC
I don't have the famous french accent when I talk so it's pretty fun to fool around with people
> english subs because they were faster released than french
Hahaha literally exact same reason, Toradora was SO slow to be released in French subs so I just switched to English, I already knew the plot and could recognize some words in Japanese so I just went with it and somehow understood most of it
Gaming was not an option, I spent all my teenage years playing Dofus and nothing else, so I didn't need english
"Sell Code Audio, no noob, no scam"
> you get used to same day release
it’s over
Yup, no coming back in French, nowadays it even feels
wrong to watch anime with french subs, like it's not how it's supposed to be
no arnak
I wasn't really a user of any website, I just direct downloaded what I found, then I went on 4chan, found nyaa, and then animebytes opened and I went on it in like 2011 and haven't moved since
I don't even watch anime anymore, I download something once a month just so my account don't go inactive, you know, just in case
Most people looked weird at me when I said I  was going to make mine in Lithuania
I was studying in Boulogne-sur-mer near Dunkirk and man it’s one of the most desperate place in France
On the other hand I was also studying in Reunion island and there were also a lot of Erasmus on it
It must be one of the most unique place Erasmus has to offer
I hope you didn't die because it's illegal there
Did you visit a lot ? How does it feel to be on an island so far North with so little people on ?
You should never go in the North of France it sucks as hell
Bretagne is freaking cool the only bad point is the weather
Btw where did you go
Yeah, learning a language quickly is one of the perks of studying abroad
I have nothing but positive thing to say as well honestly
It's pretty poor and even though people are really kind they're pretty weird and it's the kind of destination even the French avoid sometimes, everything is made of concrete, the weather is often bad so there are not many interesting things to see there
They could go to Brittany then
I mean, blue-eyed blond people *tend* to be more Northern and people with tanned skin, dark eyes and hair *tend* to be more Southern, but it's really not an absolute
Especially because here in France we're a bit in the middle of this so we really have people about equally distributed on that spectrum
I would definitely not be able to recognise a fellow French person abroad based on appearance alone
My very general rule of thumb: if the very tip of their nose is pointy from the side, there's a very good chance that they're from the east of a Poland/Croatia line
I'm talking about the tip here, not the bridge of the nose - I know aquiline noses can also be found in Central/Eastern Europe
It's having a rounded chickpea at the tip rather than a pointy profile that's rare there
First noticed that during a football match, have since then shared my theory with a bunch of Balts during a party celebrating their country's independence
At first they were all thinking that it was bullshit, but then they looked around and had to admit it held water
Years ago, if an adult was wearing something purple, he had to be German
Also if kids where looking like an arlequin (bright muticloloured clothes), German
But I guess globalization have pretty much erased most of the differences now, at least in clothing
Brands are now mostly global
I am living in a country where european tourists are mostly backpackers
I can spot my fellow French people very easily
I don't know, they have this nonchalent attitude, they do not wear very tidy clothes, and a quechua brand backpack, or some clothes or accesories from Decathlon
I cannot count how many times I spotted someone from relatively affar, thinking he was French, and then hearing French speaking when I am getting closer
There is something in the non verbal language that screams French to me
I guess we are better at spotting ours
That's very hard
I can spot a british, a western/northern european, and a southern european
There's not a lot of things that changes between german, dutch or french
Brits are red, or whiter than usual
Southern italians, southern spanish and portuguese have tanned skin
Sometimes you can also spot eastern europeans, because they have that slav facial features, but it's harder
In France, no (or not very often)
In less touristic countries (like Poland) but in touristic place (like Krakow), or in non European countries, I was able to recognize Spaniards, Frenchmen, Americans and Germans
Actually, after living for a year in Japan I have become better at distinguishing between Asian nationalities than European
The only ones I get fairly consistently in Europe are French and German people
It depends
When travelling, it's quite easy to spot the French, as they are all dressed in Quechua gear
Other nationality can be rather obvious too, mostly depending on how they dress or act
On appearance alone, it is hit and miss and quite hard, but I guess the same is true in most of Asia
I guess there are some "types" that match ones mental image of what an Italian, German or Norwegian look like, but it does not mean it is 100% accurate
You didn't guess any accent ?
The French are 100% decathlon/quechua gear
Don't forget the huge backpack and the sandals with socks underneath
I don't agree with you, in campings or sea side you can recognize Dutch, Belgian or Germans quite easily
Big expensive german car with a trailer, red skin burned by the sun, drinking a lot of beer all the day long
Quite cliché I know but I see that every summer =) They are quite nice people to play pétanque with
Where did you hear/see that stereotype
Yes but instead of a huge backpack it's a caravan and beers they brought from home
From my geoguessr experience I think it is related to Estonian (those double same vowels), but I might be wrong
I'd never heard about that one, is it actually something that's widespread
I feel like I'm learning secrets I'm not supposed to have heard about
Buy as many liter of disinfectant

Wait, the country of origin isn't indicated on produce in Belgium
In France it's mandatory
> Edit: Only one of those things is the most fundamental biological urge of humanity
Well shit I guess some of us aren't human then
There are probably hundreds in French but here are a few of my favourite:
"faut pas pousser mémé dans les orties" don't push granny in the nettles = don't over exaggerate, don't take it to far
"il pleut comme vache qui pisse" it rains like a pissing cow = it rains a lot
"Avoir le cul bordé de nouilles" to have one's ass circled with noodles= be very lucky
"parler anglais comme une vache espagnole" to speak English like a spannish cow =having bad english
Some of those are the exact same in French (“like an elephant in a porcelaine shop”, for example), or very close (we say “I’ll eat my hat if that happens” for things unlikely to happen, and speak of “the tree that hides the forest” when someone focuses on the details rather than on the whole)
Wonder where that comes from
Funny, I’ve never heard “tirer son plan” in France
I’d have thought that we shared expressions as we share the language
Maybe it’s used along the border
In French we have “il pleut des cordes” (it’s raining string/ropes) for the same purpose
Same in French, but in the negative: “vendre la peau de l’ours avant de l’avoir tué” (to sell the bear’s fur before you’ve killed it)
We usually use it to say “don’t [sell the bear’s fur ...], meaning: “do it before you speak of it”.
We do use “se débrouiller” (and “la débrouille”, noun but same origin), but it’s a verb rather than an expression/idiomatic
Thanks for your explanations
Yes, we use “à tantôt”, for “see you later” (with the underlying idea that you don’t know when this “later” will be)
We have the [*Académie Française*] the French Academy
I thought they were only relevant (sort of) in France, but other comments in this post seems to hint that they are somewhat known in neighbouring French-speaking countries
The *Académie* is an official authority on the French language, but since its rulings are not binding, nobody listens to them
They also have no linguistics expertise (members are mostly authors, and they are often at odds with linguists) and are rather conservative
But since nobody really cares about them, it is not a burning issue in France
Yes, L’Académie Française
The academy was established in the 17th century and has authority on French grammar, vocabulary and usage
I knew about the Office Québécois, and I knew they communicated with the Académie, but I didn't think the Québécois themselves were aware of what the Académie is saying on various matters
As far as I know, the Office is doing a better job at protecting the French language against some anglicisms, but that may be the rose-tinted vision we have from the other side of the Atlantic
Well people don't feel concerned about their decisions, most of them seem out of the touch, but sometimes they are showing common sense, for exemple they declared that the "écriture inclusive" (inclusive writing
) is a danger to the French language, something that I 100% agree on
Basically this style of writing is to put a dot in the end of gendered words in order to include the feminine "e". For exemple, for the word "écrivains", the inclusive writing version would be "écrivain
e.s". It is ugly, it doesn't make any sense at all, and for once I'd appreciate that the french academy would be listened
I think we usually listen unless it’s an obviously stupid decision like this one
“Virus” is masculine so it doesn’t make sense
It’s a virus
Disease is a general term
Heh, Kinda ?
On a subreddit most people seemed to think that, for whatever reason, swiss french and quebec french were vastly different than france french to the point where mutual intelligibility was not a thing
When I told them that it was not the case, I was met with disbelief
Well, now you're just making languages up
Yes and it's very interesting to listen to
Usually very much understandable tbh
It's somewhat common outside the anglosphere especially in France, Québec and french-speaking Belgium
I like the swiss accent, they sound cute when they speak french <3
Great thanks for sharing
Cajun country music absolutely sounds Murican, and at the same time speaks like rural pre-1900 France
weird but great mix of cultures

Paris and Marseille have a huge rivalry in footbal competitons and each time their teams have a match against each other you can expect clashes in the streets of those cities between supporters
"Did you know how Bordeaux was created ? We threw our dumbasses into the Garonne, and they stopped just before the ocean" is something that people from Toulouse would say
So we could say that Bordeaux and Toulouse are quite rivals
There are other rivalries in France, sometimes related to football, sometimes related to history
In France it would be Paris and Marseille
It’s a bit of an uneven feud though
Parisian don’t really care, they might just make a joke about the accent
Some marseillais will antagonize you or damage your car for having an Ile-de-France (Paris) number on your license plate
Same here with Paris but in worse
The rivalry is huge in football, but in other fields I don't think Paris takes any "rivalries" seriously
I feel like only people from Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux care about competing with Paris
Parisians are obsessed with themselves only
We also had the Marseille/
Lyon thing going on for quite some times (OL vs OM)
I do believe that it’s less strong that’s days, though
We all know the true opposition is Paris/province (everything besides Paris)
So Bucharestn't?
Tbf there isn't any city that can rival in size or power Paris
France is so centralized that Paris cannot have any rivals
It's the political, economical, historical and demographic enter of France
Nah dude
We have a rivalry with Saint-Étienne, not Paris
OL = Lyon, not Toulouse
The term "province" is so fucking insulting
I always hated it
yeah it’s kinda ridiculous, I don’t get the hate at all
I know there’s some rivalry with football clubs but that level of antagonistic behavior seems hardly appropriate
Lille - Lens
Rennes -  Nantes
And so on
Fair enough
Though from personal experience, Lyonnais are very quick to point out to me how Paris is a terrible place to live in, and how Lyon is Europe's most marvelous city
Woups, my mistake, I’ll fix that
My brain cells connected funny
There's not everything that revolves around Paris
Ask Stéphanois if you want a confirmation that Paris is not our rival
Is this a joke ? Your country militarily occupies a foreign nation and has the gall to say that they are pro unification ?
ah ! true
Many "romantic" cartoon characters with a French accent have an Italian accent in France, because that's the country we see as romantic (main example that comes to mind: Pepe le Pew)
In the Simpsons Willy the gardener has a Norman (If I'm not wrong) accent for his Scottish one
It's funny, all cops in France have a strong southern accent
Couper le conntact et sortez la carteuh grise monsieur
Is "Barbarians" the name of the series you talk about
Oh he's French in the original
I didn't know that
But I guess it makes sense
More than 20 dialects and i am not even counting outside of the "métropole".
All the dialects of French have been wiped out in mainland France
A few examples of dialects **of French** by old native speakers :
- [Gallo] (Eastern Brittany)
* [Lorrain] (Vosges)
* [Walloon]
* [Berrichon]
Someone already asked a similar question [here]
nearly every region of region has its own dialect
Same here, except if you count accent as a dialect
Italy has literal languages
Piemontese, Ligurian, Venetian, Sardinian, Napolitan etc
aren't dialects of Italian
Dialects are often minority languages so many answers to either question apply to the other
At least for France, dialects are minority languages, I don't know enough about other countries but I assume the situation is similar in (at least) some other European countries
Yeah I didn't say it was always the case, that's also why I talk about Europe specifically because the situation in other parts of the world is very different
The  "French" fries
French Wikipedia says it originated from Chinese workers in the US during WW1 while English Wikipedia says the origin was a French military hospital, it's funny
It's like saying Washington or Beijing
Of course the citizen take no part in the decisions
Hey, we didn't do anything
It's not our fault if Americans don't know you exist, no one in France claims fries are French
Not according to the university of Liege
No, they aren't Belgian
Belgians think that they were frying potato stick at the end of the XVII century while potatoes only arrived in Belgium in 1735
Also back then the people were refusing to eat potatoes it was considered food for animal and it took the convincing of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier through France and Europe to have people eating potatoes
It's generally accepted that people started eating potatoes in France from 1770 and really in 1785, after a famine, where potatoes saved them
So I really doubt that people in Paris were not even considering eating potatoes while in Belgium they were frying them for over a century
The text claiming Belgian were frying potatoes is also non-existant
It's a hoax
Moreover, the fat, oil, animal fat, butter
was a luxury back then
It's extremely unlikely that peasant or poor people will have used it for frying
Most of sources point to a Parisian origin
And it was introduced in Belgium by a german ambulant seller during fare
[  (and this is written by someone from the University of Liège
French fries is actually really french
I was curious about it and looked it up, and it would seem that noone really knows whether they are belgian or french
They are definitely more of a "belgian culture" thing, but noone truly knows if they were born in Belgium
**SOPHIE MOENS —** **Et à cette époque, il y a des pommes de terre frites en Belgique ?**
PIERRE LECLERCQ — Non, pas encore
Aux alentours de 1842, un immigré bavarois du nom de Frédéric Krieger travaille dans une rôtisserie à Montmartre et apprend à y confectionner des frites40
En 1844, il s’installe comme forain en Belgique et ouvre la première barraque à frites du pays
Pour faire sa publicité, il annonce des « pommes de terre frites à l’instar de Paris » et insiste sur le fait qu’il a fait son apprentissage à Paris
C’est à partir de cette date que les Belges découvrent la frite qu’ils accueillent avec beaucoup de bienveillance
Krieger, qui s’est fait surnommer « Monsieur Fritz, le roi de la pomme de terre frite » fait d’ailleurs fortune et inspire un grand nombre d’émules
So the first "barraque à Frite" in Belgium was opened by a Bavarian who learned how to make fries in Paris and was called "Pommes de terre frites à l'instar de Paris / Parisian's art potato fries"... ;)
You guys blame North Macedonia to be called Macedonia though, doesn't that fit the thread ?
I met a Greek in Brussels, he seems too angry about that considering that now they changed their country name
they're insane with it
Once I went to Sweden and my friends were packing alcohol in Denmark in prep
I was like "meh, it's Sweden, they'll have alcohol
"... well well well
Turns out that in supermarket they only sell light alcohol, no more than 3
5%. So you can't even buy a normal beer in a supermarket
You have to go to special liquor stores, which could be hard to find, especially if you're outside a city, and it's much more expensive
Same for bars, it's super expensive
and they have rules of not drinking outside or stuff like that
Luckily my friends forced me to pack some alcohol too
Another time I was in Norway, same shit
We sat on a terrasse, got our beers served and then we decided to move to another side of the terrasse (better view
I don't remember why we moved), but we had to walk like 5m on the street for it
The waitress ran at us, and was like "what are you doing, you can't do that
"... the problem was that we were on the streets with alcohol
On the bar's terrasse it was ok, was considered private, but on the street no
Only the waitress was allowed
So she took our beers, we went to sit where we wanted and she carried back our beer to us
In Denmark it's like the rest of Europe, you can get drunk in the street, supermarket sell normal alcohol, bars have normal rules
When people say Brussels they don’t mean they Belgium somehow decided stuff unilaterally, they just mean the EU institutions in Brussels
mais en fait les dernières recherches historique tendent à une origine parisienne de la frite
En tout cas c'est quasi sûr que les frites étaient mangées à Paris avant d'être connues en Belgique
> Everyone tosses the blame amongst the Spanish, the English and even the Dutch, but the Portuguese usually get a pass, for some reason
*French whistling in the background*
I've heard that a alcohol is also crazy expensive in Denmark
edit : Ok apparently I was wrong, you can buy cheap alcohol in Denmark
I'm just being flippant
The whole "freedom fries" thing was just kinda hilarious from our perspective, considering everyone in France knows (or thinks they know, since there appears to be conflicting evidence) fries to be Belgian

Greeks and arabs haven't had anything to do with one another for like 700 years
It's been greeks and turks since then, and turks use a latin alphabet
So, I don't know where this whole idea comes from
Greek alphabet is pretty different from the arabic one too
It could look cyrillic to the untrainef eye, maybe ?
Is there a school subject that seems to only exist in your country
Or on the contrary, one that seems to exist everywhere but not in your country
For example, France doesn't have "Religious education" classes
Edit: (As in, learning about Religion from an objective point of view, in a dedicated school subject
We learn about religion, but in other classes)
Just to correct you about religion class in France :
We do have it in Alsace and Moselle, due to us being German when these laws were adopted
I've even heard a few times that it is mandatory, and we would have to write a derogation not to have this class, which most people do, but don't take my words on that
In France we have philosophy in high school it teaches us to think rationnaly
You could've mentioned technology we have in middle school, it's a weird subject, there's some learning about industry and production but the teachers seem to all be uninterested
J'ai eu un cours optionnel "étude des religions" au lycée. J'étais dans un lycée privé breton donc c'est peut-être pour ça.
Je suis athée, et pourtant j'ai beaucoup apprécié ce cours
Le prof nous a expliqué les bases historiques et culturelles de l'islam, du judaïsme, du boudhisme, du protestantisme et des sectes religieuses
Si on regarde ce cours comme un cours d'histoire géo, c'était plutôt intéressant de voir l'origine des croyances de 70% de la population mondiale
Le prof était clairement catho, mais n'a pas mentionné une seule fois sa religion
J'ai eu la chance d'avoir un prof "impartial", mais je peux comprendre que ce genre de cours peu très rapidement déraper
Je pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée de l'enseigner à tout le monde
I wish we had this
so many people of my generation (90s) and younger can't cook anything properly or run a house efficiently
Included myself, I had to learn later by myself
That's included in French classes here
We learn about religion, it's just not a subject on its own
We learn about it in History-geography class, in Civic and moral education (or "how to be a good citizen" class) among other classes
We have a mandatory Philosophy class in our last year of high school, which comes after 7 years of studying French literature (replaces it in the last year)
I did orienteering during middle school
The final exam was in a big forest during a heatwave
and we weren't allowed to have water bottles "cause it'll be too heavy and unpractical"...
As in, a subject dedicated to learn about religion from an objective and fact-based point of view
I know that some countries have a subject dedicated to it (as opposed to us learning about religion from an objective and fact-based point of view in subjects like history-geography)
I have trouble making myself clear sorry :(
Dutch people having a bicycle exam is very on brand in my opinion
It's great that you have that, I think that back at my primary school we had something similar
Psychology
This is the first time I've ever heard of a country having that on its curriculum
That's so cool
Here, geography is put together with history (History-geography), and the geography part is basically about what's happening in the world (development of countries, ocean trade, population growth), and we have a subject similar to Earth studies, called "Science of Life and Earth" (biology, geology, climate)
That sounds very fun
Happy Cake Day
I forgot everything I had learned
It was a fun activity though, a nice welcome change from playing rugby in the rain
I know that you still have history and geography classes in other countries (I never once said that you didn't?)
I'm talking about how, in France, we don't have a subject specifically dedicated to Religion, and we learn about it in other subjects (Ethics, history), unlike other countries that have a specific school subject AND ALSO learn about it in other subjects
Objectivity in history and geography classes can be questioned, I wholeheartedly agree
French secularism and France's views towards religions are pretty complicated to explain, and I'm not the best person to do that
Bundt cake in English :)
I should've worded my point better too, then
I didn't want them to be opposed, in a what's better and what's worse manner
I attended a religion class in Germany during an exchange trip there, and I actually really enjoyed it and found it interesting
It made me wonder why we didn't have them here
I really didn't want to imply that Religion classes were bad, or rather less great than other methods
Sorry for coming across as really condescending the first time
Sooo many cities are riding the franco_belgian border
I suppose the opinions on Napoleon will vary a lot between France and the rest of Europe
In France he is seen as a man who defended us against other European powers in a time of peril and as a reformer who gave us our civil code and created an organized state that actually worked properly (both the civil code and his new organization of the state are still being used in modern France) in Europe I suppose he is probably more seen as a warmonger with an inflated ego
Yes, with North Korea, during the WW2
Pretty funny
Same goes for WWII
In France, we are mostly taught how we bravely resisted while other member states mostly focus on us surrendering
He is viewed more positively in Poland, Netherland, Italy
because those are countries that he "freed" from an other oppressor (Russia, Prussia, Austria
He's bashed by the British mostly and by the other main European powers as they are the ones who couldn't accept the French revolution and started attacking us to put a king back on the French throne
Took them 6 coalitions to achieve their goal
heh, why am I not surprised to see this is (and by far) the top comment
It seems all of Europe has something to say about Napoleon
Why do yall want to live in the land of Dracula
I think he is actually born one year after Corsica became French so it was even closer to what you say
Apparently he was often teased at military school for his thick accent when speaking French
I think he kind of sucked when it came to geopolitics though, he basically thought that the only way was to occupy all of his enemy and he completely neglected diplomacy which would have been the only way to ensure lasting peace
I think history would have been very different if had listened to Talleyrand’s idea more because Talleyrand was extremely skilled both at diplomacy and at geopolitics
Except that Napoleon never declared war, always defended himself so I dont see how warcrazy he was
Some things never change :)
It's not a very well known fact I would say
There was so much going on in Europe at the time that the fact he reinstated it in some colonies far from home kind of is overlooked
This is also the origin of the idiom: "drinking like a pole". See at first glance this might seem to be a slightly racist dig at the polish
But in reality it is not
After the battle was over, a French officer complained that the polish soldiers were drunk to try to minimize their exploits in battle
Napoleon would have said: "then you should have drunk like the poles".
Another origin story I read is slightly different
Both Polish and French troops drank a lot the day before the battle
But come morning only the poles were actually fit to fight and the French were hungover
So drinking like a pole mean that you can drink a lot and still be in control
Well, that definitely happened
Ofc de Gaulle was useful and coordinated the resistance to some extent but (and I am being influenced by my grandfather opinion here, not sure how general it is) de Gaulle definitely took all the credit
He was an opportunist at that point
He's also responsible for that "no collaborators in France" and "everyone resisted here" crap
Though, I've never heard anyone else in France tell me this
I think saying de Gaulle took all the credit and didn't deserve it is quite an unpopular opinion (I might be wrong)
One of the worst decision of him
Should have never put his brother on the throne of Spain
That's definitively an unpopular one
Something that's made me laugh is when we learned of the 18 June speech on the BBC WE were taught it's an important point in France resisting but in the end almost nobody listened to this speech
I've found it to be a popular opinion with people who experienced the war, including my father and my grandmother
Baby boomers are those who idolize De Gaulle
I can understand why they do as they grew up in economical prosperity while De Gaulle was in power
No wonder why he was viewed as the savior
Ignorance is not a fault to be forgiven
If you are interested in Napoleon I cannot recommend enough you read about Talleyrand
He was kind of the man in the shadow for several rulers including Napoleon and he is a very interesting character
« Napoleon’s master, a life of prince Talleyrand » is both fascinating and very informative
Like ?
Because we destroyed your team ^^
Napoleon never invaded Britain and the war was started by the British, nice try though
Yes and ? War was declared by Britain, France was justified in planning an invasion (Napoleon never tried to do it, only planned to) I fail to understand your logic
I'm French but basically fluent in English and I can get by in German
I obviously understand those pages, I get bits and pieces of the Dutch and Flemish ones, and am pretty lost when it comes to the Scandinavian ones
I haven't scrolled through it all but am I the only one to wear my best clothes at home
I'm talking about cashmere and silk, which are much more comfortable and luxurious than cotton or god forbid some polyester blend
But when I go out I dress more utilitarian
Sweat pants/tops don't even come in to the picture
In Russia yes but in France it doesn't exist
No, I don't. I put on nice clothes at home just for myself, or just for my family and loved ones
Worn out stuff I wear when painting or doing dirty jobs, and I change back when I'm done
There is a oldish song called « Les lacs du Connemara » that is very popular in student parties for its rhythm
It is basically a song about the beauty of Irish countryside, the resilience of Irish people and of course it has a clear anti English bias
It’s mainly popular for its rhythm since it alternates slow parts that you can sing at the top of your lungs and faster parts that you can dance like an idiot to
La strasbourgeoise and le chant de l'oignon
But tbh nobody would care
We know that our History (in Europe) is drenched with the blood of our neighbors .
[*Le Boudin*] is the official march of the French Foreign Legion
The chorus contains:
> Hey, here is [boudin] here is boudin, here is boudin
> For the Alsatian, Swiss, and Lorraine troops,
> For the Belgians, ain't no more,
> For the Belgians, ain't no more,
> They're a bunch of *lazy sons of a bitch*
This last term is not easy to translate, the French term is *tireurs au cul*, which means “lazy” but not in a nice way
I don't know why the Belgians are aimed here
French here, I don't know about "people sing it anyway" because these songs are not that popular but I think we have a tons of them
I guess that come with the fact that we often have dark humour and in context they are not offensive
Some examples from the top of my head :
A song mocking the KKK with lyrics as if the singer was part of it, by a full white band has a line "Va nous falloir un négro" which translates to "We are gonna need a nigga". Not shocking to me at all but I know Americans tend to be really strict with who can use the n word
Same band has plenty of lyrics with dark humor that are satire
A song about who to take in an Noah's Ark because the end of the world is near "Let's not forget women to repopulate the Earth, and wash the dishes when it will be repopulated".
&#x200B;
Other artists, a "clash" between them (they are friends irl), first one is black and the other is arab :
\- "Your women fantasize on our scent, \[...\], you'd rather stone them to death so they'd rather get dicked from us"
\- "Bonobos only think of fucking beurettes, they neglect their women excised with monkey wrenches" (Beurette are \~ young arabs women)
&#x200B;
Plenty of punchlines use a very well known French court affair in which a known French Singer (Bertrand Cantat from band "Noir Désir") killed his wife (Marie Trintignant) with physical abuse (iirc he slapped her and she fell / hit her head) :
"Truth is a "noir désir" cause when it slaps you it takes your life"
"Shut up or you will be Marie Trintignant-ed"
"You tried to Bertrand Cantat her"
&#x200B;
Some would just be considered rude I guess ? For example there is a song "You got no dad" in which the lyrics are about someone mocking a child who grew up without a father and telling him it could have been worse
Do you know that your anthem "god save the queen", was originally a french song made for king Louis XIV of France "Dieu, sauve le roi", as a get better song made by some nun because he had an anal fistula that wasn't healing
&#x200B;
>The French [Marquise de Créquy] wrote in her *Souvenirs* that a song named "Grand Dieu, sauvez le Roi
" ("Great God, save the King"), with words by [Marie de Brinon] \[[fr] and music by [Jean-Baptiste Lully] was performed in gratitude for the survival by [Louis XIV] of an [anal fistula] operation
(The surgical knife purpose-made for the occasion is on display in the [Musée d'histoire de la médecine] Créquy claimed that the tune was later plagiarised by [Handel] and so adopted by the British as "un de leurs air nationaux". (The entire story might have been intended as a joke
) After the [Battle of Culloden] the Hanover dynasty supposedly adopted this melody as the British anthem
A different song, "[Domine, Salvum Fac Regem] ("Lord, save the King"), was the unofficial French anthem until 1792
I don't know how true it is, and of course British are denying it is, but I have to say, as a French I love so much to think that the British national anthem might be a plagiat of a song based on an anal fistula of one of our past king, so I'm gonna pretend it's true and no arguments will change that
We also have a few military marching songs that are about fighting the invaders and which are still being taught to recruits today and sung during marches
I will let you guess who the invader in question is but a good clue would be that it is now one of our most important allies
[ here you go
It's basically an anthem to the cold beauty of Ireland and resistance to british
And yes, I can't count the number of times a party has ended on that song, with all wasted french, from 15 to 70 years old, dancing all together, and shouting the refrain of that song unendlessly (we generally make it loop for 15 min at least
[There you go !]
Generally we grab our friends by the shoulders and jump around like drunken idiots while singing the lyrics
Basically it's a marching song about loving onion and not  giving it to the austrians, we may call them dogs too
"But no onions for the Austrians,
No, no onions for those dogs"
Pretty spot on description of Finnish though, there
Yep
Yep we do
I've never danced it sobber so yeah I am a drunken idiot when I listen to it
Hey ! Qui t'a autorisé à me filmer ?
*\*drunkenly echoing from France\**
OOOOOH FLOOOOOWeeeeeEEEER of ScooooOOOOOOtlaaaAAAAAAAAND
when will we

We haven’t had a war with Britain since the fall of Napoleon and the congress of Vienna
I was thinking of Au 31 du mois d'août which is about the British
Sure, it’s your turn being the baddy though
I play CKII and I never seem to stray too far from the Mediterranean
My best games tend to be played around Greece, Egypt, the Levant, Tunisia, Iberia or Italy/Southern France
I enjoy the British Isles too, but I'd say that 80% of my games are somewhere around the Med
I don't really know why, to be honest
When it is independant (CK2, EU4) I try to play brittany but I always rage quit because I get steam rolled
In HOI4 I play Spain for the civil war but as the game without DLC is pretty boring I genrally play Kaisserreich and I generally play the USA for the civil war
I did a CKII playthrough and played as Scotland
Got allied with France obviously
I didn’t finish the playthrough though because I didn’t like that you could not play the battles
I play total war warhammer II now
The great trial awaits

What is the longest city/town name in your country ?
For exemple, in France, Saint-Remy-en-Bouzemont-Saint-Genest-et-Isson (Marne), Saint-Germain-de-Tallevende-la-Lande-Vaumont (Calvados) and Beaujeu-Saint-Vallier-Pierrejux-et-Quitteur (Haute-Saône) are equal with 38 letters each
Don't forget about Niederschaeffolsheim and Mittelschaeffolsheim that have 20 letters each but written as a single word
Yeah I knew about this one
I've already seen Balatonmáriafürdő which has 17 letters while Jászfelsőszentgyörgy has only 16
I bet it was someone's last name
Here we have Y
Came here exactly for this one
Honorary mention to Pfaffenhoffen that is not that long but has 5 Fs
Vive l'Alsace
But Balatonmáriafürdő has more
As a French, that pronunciation is absolutely counter-intuitive
As the first -a in “Arabic”? Let me check the pronunciation of Arabic
Erase that, as the second -a in Arabic
Or, better, as the -a in “girafe”!
Yes, I learned a bit (just a bit
It just so happens that I know those you mentioned) about your prononciation last year, as I had a geography course on arctic regions
No offense but I dreaded oral exams because of you, guys
Haha, you made me laugh with that monsieur
I’m actually a mademoiselle ;)
I never would have guessed the Tour de France was popular abroad, Reddit made me realize it was
It’s a bit sad that we don’t learn much about Norway in class, all I know are bits of mythology, and what I learned last year (but I only learned about the Arctic part of your country)
I’d love to visit one day, though
My sister traveled to Norway a few years ago, and she loved it so much she made me want to see for myself
Yes, what surprised me is that it’s _not_ huge at all in my family
Like, I know lots of people are watching it, and I listen to the records on the radio when I happen upon them, but that’s it
I’m glad you like it, though :) It must have been awesome, seeing a fellow Norwegian win (again, right
I think I remember at least another Norwegian winning before
(I’m more into football and it definitely felt awesome)
Ok, I definitely need to take a look at it more often
I don’t know the name of any of them, nor that of the current maillot jaune, nor (now that I think of it) the name of any French winner
I just know that one
English
And a French guy died of enhancing drugs & alcohol on the tour, and that it ends on the Champs Elysées (learned that the hard way, I was working there two years ago selling ice cream when they arrived
The crowd
I did not expect the crowd
It was super nice seeing them, though, and that day I understood the fame a little)
I know Wiggins and Thomas
Well, I recognize the names
_But_, that must count as something already :,)
I want to visit smaller cities in Belgium and Germany, but maybe seeing Berlin before that could be nice (I already visited cities like Bohn, Köln, Aachen, Düsseldorf)
I wanted to go to Sydney but I have the feeling Australia will be relieving lock down rules pretty late :(
My sister studied there for a year as an Erasmus student and she really liked the place :)
Versailles and more specially the Castle
&#x200B;
To be fair it was the home of the king of France so I can understand why it looks so rich even today so I have nothing to say really
Switzerland and Zurich in particulat it's only 200 km away from where I live but it's crazy how rich it feels being in Zurich
Ahahah i concur
Only place I ever saw someone wipe their ass on the plateforme
she most probably took a shit in the trash can just before
I’m glad that day my instinct told me to take left and not right, otherwise I would have arrived in the plateforme right at that moment ! Thankfully I only saw it from 20m away
From Europe I've seen Irish, Swedish, Ukrainian and Russian plates
I'm from quite a wealthy area so Qatari and Emirates plates are not unheard of
the most exotic i've actually seen was an American plate
As a student I worked at a toll booth, with incoming traffic from Italy (and Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter here)
I've seen trucks with licence plates from basically every country of continental Europe, apart maybe Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia
Even Moldova, Baltics or Turkey (which are really not that rare)
The oddest one I had would be a truck from Kazakhstan
No idea what would his load be to get from that far away
Edit : Thinking again, I'm almost sure I had trucks from Albania several times actually
I saw one car with a Californian plate in Greece and several cars from Guadeloupe, Martinique and La Réunion in France
Last G7 summit in Biarritz, Donald Trump was there and hundreds of CIA / secret service guys too
Never saw that many US plates in France, it was strange
in term of distance
it's France (but from Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana)
That's a hell of a road trip, but it could be fun with the right car and the right people
*Arobase* is more common, you can sometimes find *a commerciale* (commercial a) or the English *at* when spelling an email address
We say "**arobase**" but wikipedia say there's  a fuckton other way you can say it
&#x200B;
In French it's arobase (from the spanish word IIRC) and except for the mails, it is used to describe the price per unit
And according to Google, “Arobase” means “'a' minuscule entouré d'un rond” which means “A circled lowercase a”
TIL I had no clue it had another meaning !
That explanation doesn't explain the name in other similar languages such as spanish and portuguese (arroba)
That comes from arabic arroub to mean quarter
Because French arobase and Spanish/Portuguese aroba were a unit of weight (quarter of 100 ponds)
Source : the actual French dictionary
Yes it is very much used in French
Not really, never heard it from French people, except maybe those who speak English on a regular basis
Generally everyone still says arobase even for email adresses
It was only used for a short period of time; But damn that's useful
Like
8 kiwis @ 70c
that's clear like rock water
I saw it comes from a contraction of "a rond bas". And tbh it make much more sense than the arabic etymology
France > Spain > Any European country > \[...\] > England
I have a very simple cheering system
If England is playing, cheer for whichever team is playing against them
If a European country that is not England is playing against a non-European country, cheer for them
If Germany is playing against another European country, cheer for them (I spent a significant part of my childhood in Germany)
I am a northerner and we tend to cheer for Belgium when France is not available because northern france culture and belgian walloon culture tend to be close
I know that the opposite is never true though
Usually I root for Russia
I also like the Germans
Depends
If it's Rugby : France, England (Hubby is a brit after all) , Japan (because they're sweet)
If it's football : France / Spain (please don't ask me to pick one), Belgium, Netherlands, all the others and then
Right at the end
Germany
France obviously
The other french speaking country+Italy and spain
Is it a country that drench schnitzel in gravy
I'll be damned if I ever cheer for Italy though
Nah
France > Belgium > Germany > pretty much anyone > Italy > England
In rugby, France > Wales > Italy > Ireland > Scotland > Southern hemisphere > England
>but after their last World Cup performance I am going to back Croatia next time
What did we do wrong ? Is it the defensive playstyle ?
But not surprised
Oof, yeah I can't cheer for Italy in sports neither, also Portugal since that awful game in the last Euro finals
I was SALTY
>France (not always)
Depends on the weather ?
forbidden love
The look of disgust on my italian roommates when they realized that I (like most french people) took my coffee "lungo" (which is basically italian espresso with a couple big spoons of additional water)
I never dared ask them what they thought about "americano" coffee but I assume they would have broke my nose
You kind of find that in the north of France too
I now live in Lyon after growing up in the north of France and it was a nice change to realize that getting shitfaced and punch the shit out of each other was not the norm here
>Paris is a massive city but its not 24/7 at all
The only thing 24/7 you can find in France are very few McDonald's in the big cities probably
>Then I went to France (Orleans and nearby area) for a year and had to take a day off every time i needed to go to the bank or post office because their hours matched mine perfectly
My lunch break was theirs as well, and when my working hours ended so did theirs
I have no idea how and when people do administrative stuff without needing to miss work
Every French person is complaining about this
It's even worse for the tax office
Mine is open from 9am to 12 and from 2pm to 4pm
That is actually ridiculous
>You put water in your coffee
Do you just eat the beans
Not really popular in France
The standard in France is lungo, I would say second most common is espresso
I am not even 100% sure how I would go about ordering one in a French café honestly
It’s a bit confusing because the maginot line was extremely strong
The goal of maginot line was to force the German to avoid it to win time by presenting a incredibly hard challenge and it did work
The problem was the French high command being retarded as fuck and not covering the Ardennes because it was supposed to be unpassable with tanks
Lmao, good one
Funny I would have said that espresso (or "expresso") is the standard here
At least that's what I get when I ask for a "café" in Paris
Maybe that varies across regions
I think lungo is the favorite in France  because you can sip it with a croissant or a cigarette while the espresso just goes in one sip
Yeah Belgium refused that fortifications be built along their borders which is why it stopped right before the Ardennes
"Pregame" in French because we copy way too many words from the other side of the sea
I generally do that nowadays, I just order a double espresso
It’s twice the price though since it’s basically two coffees in one cup
I don't really think about Andorra and Monaco (those are the two I'm the most familiar with so I'll only talk about them), it's more of "ah yeah right they exist" feeling
At least I know some stuff about Monaco, like Grace Kelly, the royal family, casinos, pretty sure it's a tax heaven, and I think there's a car race there
but like I know nothing about Andorra besides the fact that technically whoever is President of France at the moment is the co-ruler of the country, and it's probably also a tax heaven
I don't think about them
At least they are just tax heaven so parasite
I don't think about them often, to be frank, except Malta which I visited twice and loved
It's nice that there can be little states which live free from much bigger countries right next door
I wonder how they didn't get invaded and annexed in the course of History, that alone is some interesting topic to research
What about former microstates
A peculiar one is the **Republic of Mulhouse** in Alsace, it was independant and Republican from 1347 until 1798, when it asked to be incorporated into France, under military pressure of course
Beyond my loathing for the Vatican, I don’t really think about them
that we should annex any French-speaking microstates, especially those that serve as tax havens
They're little more than tax havens for the most part
I live close to Andorra, and I've been there a few times
I've also been to Luxembourg
Only thing that I feel about them microstates is why do they even exist ?
Dude, Luxembourg is huge compared to the other states you mentioned
We are not a micro state
All micro states fit in our country and more
Just check a map
Luxembourg is not a micro state
I live just next to Monaco, I go there sometimes, but I never met someone on the Internet who's actually from there lmao
Luxembourg is not a micro state
Much bigger than all micro states and we can survive on our own, except maybe electricity
Where most micro states import nearly everything
It is actually cited as the last genuine city-state today
City-states probably also are micro-states for the most part
I don't think much of it except that gas is gonna get more expensive and that's annoying, but people believing it's actually gonna trigger some kinda WW3 are just delusional or just wish to see something big happening during their lifetimes, unfortunately it's not gonna happen just with that
It will be a repeat of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars
The US will spend trillions of taxpayer money, thousands of Americans will die, tens of thousands will deal with injuries for the rest of their lives
Hundreds of thousands of locals will die
Most Americans won't care and most, even after 10 years, won't be able to point at Iran on a world map
I hope France does a repeat too and tell Trump to get fucked
It will mess up the region even more
I think that it would be nice if the US could just stop trying to make war with everyone and start looking at how to improve the things that obviously malfunction in the country
If you guys were to put the army money into, I don’t know, education or healthcare, don’t you think you would be slightly better off ?
"may have"? It sure does look like it
even the US are saying they did it
>the cynic part of my brain thinks how convenient it is, starting something that could Lead to a war or fights for us troops (on foreign soil, not in the usa) with the upcoming elections and then the voters have to rally behind the orange guy and vote for him
Trump would agree with you :  [
I hope so
The UK
The British or the Dutch
They're already everywhere in summer
Russia
England
Not the UK
Just,
England
Same as always
Was it in the 8th century, or am I unaware of some interesting piece of trivia ? :)
There is no way Turkey is invading you, or anyone else in the EU
Your answer might still be correct (in terms of most likely amongst a bunch of incredibly unlikely options), but still
I would say Brasil, for Guyane
Il faut empêcher la vente de crème solaire à ces malandrins
Le cancer de la peau se chargera du reste !
London is already captive ! Our city <3
Russia is the only European country to have recently invaded another country (or two)
It's the most reasonable answer for many European countries
Good point
No, no
France
You know, I like the Valle d'Aosta
Do you mind ?
Thanks ! I didn't know that
Wouldn't have happened if you had been in the EU
I'm pretty sure anyway
I think in France the bistrot kinda fit the description
I'd say actually you can find fairly cheap homely British food in pubs, greasy spoons, and "sandwich bars / fry up" places (not sure what to call them)
I read OP’s question as privileging “cheap” over “good”, so pub would do
I have in mind the cafes types everywhere in London that do sandwiches, fry ups, coffee, builders’ tea
Not sure what to call them
*Comme un boomerang* by Serge Gainsbourg
It should have been an Eurovision song but due to tons of issues it was only released after his death
Wikipedia article about all the issues (in French) :
The music :
I don't know whether it's called this but 'Je ne connais pas l'Afrique' by 'M'. Super catchy
Alright, so
I think this is a Finnish christmas song
I have no idea what it's about exactly, but I got the tune stuck in my head since I've seen [this live] (the whole audience singing the song around 2'20 and again at the end is simply haunting)
Finnish sounds so fucking beautiful
Hell yeah !
I'm always up for some Finnish music and litterature even though I dont understand sh
But yeah, when it comes to music, you guys are a few levels ahead of everyone else (and so far, this is turning up to become a nice addition to my playlist, and I'm not even halfway through ! Hasnt yet fully kicked in !)
[... or dream
[... or drunk
Yeah, not for nothing Finland (and the neighboring Swedes too I must confess) has been at the top of my dream-destinations for a while !
... But as a Mediterranean, I fear I might be too loud and extrovert for you guys ! **/s**
There's no accent for Hagrid in the French version, not even a funny way to speak ... I watched the film in french and read the translated book as well but there's literally nothing on his way of speaking
But I read from an interwiew that apparently, the official translator decided not to retranscript any accent in french cause they don't want people to feel offended that a character would use their accent and that it would be made fun of
(from what i understand)
Which probably would happen cause in France, somehow, if your accent is different from the flat parisian, most of the time it's seen as a joke and it's a common thing in medias to laugh about it than to accept and appreciate it
He didn't have any accent but he did sound a little gruff but in a super-cute-big-bearish way
He didn’t have an accent in French, but he had a "big man" voice, if that makes any sense
Totally unrelated to Harry Potter, but in one episode of the new Lucky-Luke cartoons, one episode has a Scottish rugbyman come to the prison
Well in the French audio, they made him speak with a south-west accent (think Bordeaux and such), because that's where rugby is the most popular
So you've got this guy dressed in a full kilt, speaking in the chocolatine language
Translators are fun people sometimes
100%.
I usually hate French version but the Harry Potter one is pretty amazing I'll admit
I can't quite grasp of it's a good thing for you that his middle name is Elvis, but we've also changed his lastname
Correct
They had to change it because otherwise it would have been « Elvis » haha
It’s just a fun fact
We generally call it an "antisèche" wich litteraly mean "anti-dry", to dry is a slang for "to don't know".
Une "anti-sèche" which translates literally as "anti-dry".
Here, the dry spell obviously refers to the mental desert you find yourself in when you can't remember something
As per usual in France, we have many terms for them
The most usual when I was in high school in the beginning of the 00's was a "pompe".
And as usual, pompe as different meanings, it is either a pump or a slang word for a shoe
I think here we use that term because you pump the answer from your piece of paper, I assume
For video game we say « soluce » which is short for « solution »
Also anti-seche, at least it was what our teacher called this when they allow you to bring a single sheet with your own written notes for the exam
I had lockers in middle school and high school, but I think it's school-specific
And, at least personally, I didn't really use them for anything
I couldn't leave textbooks inside because I'd need them at home for homework
We had but I always have been really bad at picking the book at the right time so I ended up almost not using them until high school
When I was 9 I had some days where my backpack weighed 18kg
We did have lockers but we didn’t use them for much because we needed to take our manuals home to do the work anyway
Only in some years in high schools did we get some books in duplicate so as to be able to leave one at school, that was cool
We did in middle school but not in high school because there just wasn't enough lockers for the whole school (middle and high school were in the same location)
In middle school science class we weighted our backpacks once and mine was 7kgs, I was about eleven
I went to 2 middle schools and 2 high schools and none of them had any lockers, I always assumed lockers were a thing you only see in American series
I guess it depends on the school
Yes, same for primary school
We all have bags (backpacks or crossbody bags, some girls also have large purses) to carry books, notebooks, pens, etc
It gets heavy really fast but I personally always found it easier to carry everything all day, rather than having to walk by your locker all the time to get stuff for the next class
When I was 9, on Thursday my backpack weighted 18kg
France, but to be fair I was an idiot
We had lockers but I was terrible with them and was always forgetting stuff in it so at one point I just always kept everything needed for the day on me
This is yet another case of the English-speaking world refusing to get on the same standard as everyone else and causing people to be confused about what a "billion" is, including even English-speakers, as English has both a "short" system (the one you described) and a "long" system (in which billion means the same thing as it does everywhere else)
&#x200B;
So yeah, to answer the question, we go: million (a thousand times a thousand)), milliard (a million times a thousand) , billion (a million times a million)
Fun fact: the short scale is a French invention
So it kinda is on us
Makes sense
Cyprus is heavily influenced by the English language
How does plural work in Irish
Like I mean is there a fixed ending or is it irregular
And can 2-5 plural and 5+ plural always be distinguished
Haha, I like that you guys straight up avoid the whole "billion" issue by skipping to trillion
Tf your post confused me even more lol
I'm genuinely curious where the English etymology of their versions of these numbers came from as they don't follow the same rule
Actually it's also million/milliard
Shhh, don't you know we only stress we invented it when it's a good thing
Like the metric system and fries (yes, we did invent them Belgium)
Billion can mean two different things in the English-language
That's the confusing part
My bad
America bad
Is that better
A true, sorry I mixed
Cultural biais kicked in I guess
That's pretty interesting thanks
>What do you mean by 2-5 plural and 5+ plural being distinguished
Nevermind lol idk what I was thinking about when typing but I confused Irish and Polish (maybe because of the ish I have no idea lol)
I think the person i replied to had originally forgotten it
Either that or I just misread
That's the spirit
How universal when we are basically saying that a lot of countries use milliard
Because million and trillion don't have "similar sounding endings"?
Seems like you guys have a different definition of universal too then
You're the one who brought up the endings
I don't think it's true we focus more on endings since we do also use billion, trillion etc
but for bigger numbers
You're on an American website use American numbers
Sont bizarres ces rosbifs quand même
Interesting, didn't know that
There's also a huge network of galleries in Lyon's underground, nobody is sure as to when it was built (some parts are from the Roman era) or what they were used for
Then you know it's not really recommended to go there if it exists
On another note: there's a similar book in the same universe but in Saint Petersburg
I only know the title in French (Les ombres de Post-Petersbourg) written by Andrei Dyakov
I highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet
Food and alcohol
Also we have a lot of DJs: The Avener, David Guetta, Madeon, Møme, Bob Sinclar, DJ Snake, Martin Solveig, Kungs, Petit Biscuit
We have a proud and strong striking culture
Our long standing tradition to go on massive strikes whenever the occasion arises
lololol u surrender white flag
France represents 40% of cities in the EU, we like them small and kinda empty
The museum is awesome, the sheer size of the boat is really impressive
Birdy Nam Nam, Gesaffelstein, C2C , Justice, DJ Pone ..
And our unique talent to strike
Same goes for France
And we don't even know we are good at it
It's so weird, like most languages in Europe originate from Indo-European and then there's Basque
Everybody seems to forget him, but there is also  Jean-Michel Jarre, with his huge concerts
[In Paris (3 million)]
[In moscow (3
5 million people)]
[In Houston ("only" 1,3 million)]
You only have 9 time zone we have 12
Some do, some don't, it doesn't really mean much
We might say it if there's not a lot of people in the bus and if it's calm but that's it
It's the norm in Toulouse, south of France, but not anywhere else in France as far as I know
Nah
You're exiting through the back anyway, and there are signs telling bus users not to talk to the driver
In my previous time nobody was bothering themselves with it but in the place i live now it's systematic
Don't mess with me OP, I thought everyone there is autistic
Exactly the same here
I'm told by my sister who recently moved to Montpellier that they do thank the bus driver there, so maybe a North v South divide ?
Might be
I live somewhere in the center
It's probably more of a big vs smaller cities
I used to do it in Aix-en-Provence but not in Marseille nor Paris
Never really noticed it in Strasbourg
Especially when you exit through the door waaay in the back
I mean … You'd have to basically scream ^^MEERRCIIIIIIIIIIIIII to be heard
Blizzard done fucked up
That being said it was a shite situation either way
It was a choice between:
* Don't do anything and potentially lose a huge emerging market
* Punish the guy and lose a ton of public support / get a big backlash
Still, they definitely took the wrong decision and I hope they will come to regret it (and I say that as someone who played their games for decades and still play their games today)
If you want to truly make Blizzard feel your discontent there are currently two distinct initiatives going on:
* [Mass request of GDPR data by all european players] If you don't know it basically means that Blizzard has to gather and send you literally ALL the data they have stored concerning your account, if you have been playing several of their games for any length of time it can amount [to quite a lot of data] (link of a post from a Hearthstone player who requested his data some time ago, it was only his Hearthstone data mind you)
The idea is that processing a few requests is easy, processing hundreds will be very complicated and they get fined if they don't answer within a certain number of days
If even only a couple thousand Blizzard players do it at the same time it will easily overwhelm their legal department forcing them to outsource part of the job or to get fined
Either way it costs them money and they can't not notice the discontent
* Make Mei (a chinese character from Overwatch) a trending symbol associated with Honk Kong protest on Google until chinese censors pick it up
The idea is to force the government of China to ban Overwatch from China, hitting Blizzard asian commercial policy very hard
It mainly involves sharing a maximum of Mei memes from /r/HongKong
Some of these memes are already starting to show up in pretty high position whenever you type "Mei" or "Mei Overwatch" on Google and most of them have been created less than 24h ago
I grew up on Blizzard games
I've played more WoW than I care to admit
I'm not inclined to wax poetic about a gaming company, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a soft spot in my heart for all the great memories they've helped me make
But
My dad was born in Hong Kong
I have family in Hong Kong
And even if I were to ignore my personal stake in all this, Blizzard-Activision kowtowing to Chinese pressure like this is a stunningly overt example of everything I hate most about the world's current brand of multinational capitalism
I personally can't stand Marco Rubio - he's generally a spineless, self-serving prick - but I think he got it right on the money with this [tweet]
> "Recognize what’s happening here
People who don’t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions
China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally
Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone
And it's not just the U.S. - this is a global issue
It's like what's been going on with Huawei, Chinese investment in Africa, or the Belt and Road Initiative
I don't want this slow-creep of Chinese influence to erupt into vitriolic anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment, but neither do I want to see it slowly give way to allowing the dystopian, authoritarian, and utterly corrupt Chinese government to dictate our new societal norms
Anyways, Blizzard-Activision seems to be content prioritizing its market share in China over all of this
Fine
They're welcome to take their RMB over my €, but they won't be getting both
I'm glad you're edgelording your way into this, explaining capitalism to us peasants
Thanks you for you insight, oh wise one
Other than the other thousands of them making up 80% of Reddit right now you mean ?
Yeah, it's just a repost of some bad copypasta that's been picking up traction in other threads around Reddit with the recent uproar
It's incredibly annoying because it both diminishes the gravity of Blizzard's actions while also putting the focus on gamers instead of people whose lives and freedom are quite literally on the line
Don't let your dreams be memes, folks
Seriously, come up with some better dreams
I like Czechia
Why is no one talking about Croatia ? How it extends next to the sea, but still goes inland
can i start a war if i say schnitzel is like a milanese scallop, or a cordon bleu, or torikatsu ? Or is it not controversial like hummus or fries are ?
Idk, Napoleanic France kinda goes everywhere, it's got these little bits of territory that poke out of it
Napoleonic France borders sometimes makes me think of HOI4 peace deals
"Hey let's have Croatia cause it looks cool anyways"
Can you give information on that ? I'm curious !
are UK idding us ?
That's kinda wholesome
This is absolutely the best time for European unity
Betrayed by the USA and a shameful policy by the Turks
This is the best time we will get, get EU leaders talking about military; Turkey is not more powerful than France, this is the best chance we will have to show if the EU has any say in any international affairs
Our military and political ties must strengthen within European countries, and weaken with states like Turkey and the USA
NATO needs to be widely re-imagined, and if the USA does not change it's tone to European and middle eastern politics I don't see how we can keep on relying on a military organization which gives this much power to American and Turkish politics
Trump is right, we need to spend more on our own military, a military which excludes them and any other state willing to do the things that we are seeing unravel today
I don't know much about it but we need to stay as far away as possible from this crap
We'll only make things worse by going there
Dunno, for me it's quite a big deal, maybe because I'm a ML but I would like France to retaliate against turkey
Macron received Kurdish leaders at the elysee today that's a start
You'd pick ISIS over NATO
Yes, but that does not mean that Europe is set on a certain, predecided, trajectory
Our continent and countries will develop and change according to ongoing world events and, ever since 2003 for some of us, but at the very least 2016 for the rest of the continent it seems clear that our interests lie with each other, as Europeans, as opposed to across the Pacific
As these changes in foreign alliances change a lot of the way we run our countries (and the EU) will have to adapt, which will probably come in many joint European projects regarding climate, foreign diplomacy, and evidently military power
The invasion of Iraq
Discounting for the accent, I feel that I can spot 90% of the French speaking a language (French included) when I'm not sure of the language, based solely on the lack of tonic accent we have that makes words sound like a long syllable
Most of the time you can tell
Fluent non-native speakers speak with a global English accent which is very different from any English accent from the UK
Besides, as a non-native, we tend to stick to words or expressions that resonates with our words and our language, so people whose native language is Latin based with prefer English words of Latin etymology rather than germanic roots' words
That said, (< an expression I tend to overuse because it's a carbon copy from 'ceci dit'), some non-native speakers can really imitate natives parroting expressions and tones to the point they sound native
Depends, I play a lot online video games and Italians, French and Spanish have a thick accents but Germans, Austrians and Nordic people don't have a strong one when speaking English, in my opinion
It is most of the time very noticeable, because they still have their accent
Plus, English learned as a second language isn’t perfect English, it’s “go-to” English that you can speak easily and that everyone will understand
I am really like to try and identify languages and accents, so I'm not really representative of the whole French population, but I would say I can identify somewhat well if the person is native or not
Except for some Dutch and Swedish people, who quite often have a very good accent and overall level in English (at least the ones I've met)
that last sentence is absolutely hilarious for some reason
Il n'y a voir les arbitres au rugby, on sait presque tout de suite
No I meant only French accents
For instance in this case it would be French people speaking italian that I feel I can recognise easily ; or French people speaking spanish
Though I don't speak the language I can be "oh I bet they're French"
Well on video games online where toxicity is the rule, once the french accent is spotted you got a spam of "hon hon baguette", "omelette du fromage" and so on
Mordre la poussière, biting the dust, but it has more of a meaning of "being defeated" than dying
We eat dandelions by the roots (manger les pissenlits par la racine), but we bite the dust too
We have something similar here
"Manger le pissenlit par la racine" so "to eat the dandelion at it's root"
"Mordu la poussière" also "eating the dust"
Somehow to me, it mostly is used when someone gets a beat up
Not when he dies, perhaps I’m wrong
In French, we say “*rendre l'âme*”, and it's used both for people and objects
It was originally used for people (*to give one's soul back* (to God)), and then for objects, by analogy
Our slight tendancy to strike, protest and revolt probably
We get easily angry and we often demonstrate, and if there's no reason to demonstrate then we create a new one
The fact that protest is a weekend activity , oh and also the fact that we had firefighter that set themselves on fire while T-posing to fight police ! BOI !
I love that, laughed way to hard at the third paragraph
"Having admired the sheer disregard for intuitive simplicity" -> I’m dead
Time for a counterattack
Welcome to the club !
I tend to eat a lot for a French person my age
My exchange trip to Germany was so awkward because of that
Like I was still hungry, but at the same time I wanted to be polite
True
I was in both Greece and Germany and yeah, just yeah
In Germany I was fucking hungry all the day and in Greece I thought I was gonna explode after each meal
And the world wins every time
In France we have  similar prices (my plan is 9
99€ for 60gb; I used to have a 2€ plan with 50mb when I didn't use the Internet that much on my phone
) When I saw the prices of American plans I was so sad for them
Carbonated EVERYTHING
I was traumatised when I went to Germany at 13 and was served a carbonated apple juice after I ordered an apfelsaft
Szeretnék odamenni mert olyan gyönyörűnek néz ki
As a French, a lot of the revolt don't click with me, but i very much prefer seeing my people revolt over next to nothing than not being able to revolt at all
Yeah it's a good thing, but also an already made excuse for the government not to listen "whatever we do, they'll protest".
yeah tell me something new
Equally admired and despised is my experience
I thought a cute euphemism was the way to go here :)
Yeah why
Carbonara with cream
Pineapple pizza
Oil in pasta water
Tinned ravioli
Are you sure
they're #1 in number of medals won
Nincs különbség, azt hiszem hogy ő csak féltékeny
It also is a way to stop necessary reforms, sometimes
I’m glad some of our politicians did not listen to the demonstrations of their times
Have you been to Austria
My parents told me the portions were huge there (but they didn't observe other people so maybe nobody ate all of it and you were supposed to leave the plate half full
I don't know)
Une baguette aux noix et aux amandes, s'il-vous-plaît.
I here just to nitpick because I'm French, but a restaurant can only be 3 stars at best
Only hotels can have 5 stars
We don't mess with your food, you don't mess with gastronomy
BTW, even if Italians did bring their cuisine to France, modern Gastronomy has been invented by a French: August Escoffier
There's a really great documentary on Arte's YouTube channel about it if you want

This is the longest word in french actually
We're like the rejected kid
Wow I'm sorry I pissed you off, it was all a joke
I was playing the cliché of the French that's it

All are celtic arround there
BUT they are very kind and crèpes are excellent
Or Nord pas de Calais
This is our Alabama
But the crazy one should be île de France
Everybody seems to be crazy arround here
This is where everything is too big, too expansive, too populated, too everything
In France it's definitely the north like dunkerk there they tune cars have mullets and fuck their sisters
The Jewish Autonomous Oblast is really weird
Their flag is cool though
But they have the best regional flag by far

Some washed contestant to a reality show that nobody watched
And you can't even fathom how superficial the lyrics are
In France, we have a [webradio] dedicated entirely to this
It's awesome
It plays things like [this]
look up JUL
Arouf gangsta à French legend
trashy category: [
unexpected 00's award: [
Remind me this german ["song"] quite famous in France because of a youtuber
Merci, je désire maintenant la mort
Anything by reality show contestants sucks I'd say
I immediately thought of this one when I read OP's post
It's so bad it's good
I’ll drop this one here
Les compatriotes comprendront
[This one] is really bad as well
how have I never heard from this ??
What about this masterpiece
"Le tube de l'été 2001".
guys really were not gonna talk about JUL and Koba La D
For a moment, I thought you were speaking about [Disco Pogo] from Germany
The french [reply]
This has to be one of the worst ones
Such deep lyrics
That's a deal then
Yep
With the help of his clones
I went to the university in my hometown (it is a big city) so I stayed at my parents until I started working
I could have stayed longer, there was no pressure, but it was important for me to be fully independent
As for gfs, I never brought up a gf at home because my mother (love you mum) is way too nosy so it was at my gfs' homes or other places, including car, friends places, outdoors
But generally in France, you can bring your gf sleep over
Generally also, it's best that your parents know your gf a bit before the sleep over
Receiver of Wreck is such a cool title

I want a big fire twuck for Cwristmas
La marseillaise sounds good but it's kinda hardcore and way too martial nowadays
"May an impure blood water our sillions" it's kinda hardcore
It's nice, but we usually only know the first verse, and I think it's a shame
I really love the music but not really the lyrics; personally, I would replace it with "Le chant des partisans", which I found really beautiful and have better lyrics in my opinion
I hate it
Our anthem is a war song
It is sad and violent
At least it's not boring !
That's why it's good
I agree but at the same time it’s a good celebration song !
That's why it's so great ! What's even better is that, at least the short part that we sing, does not mention our enemies by name, so it can be appropriated to whoever the "enemy" is
If you listen to some of the other martial songs of the period many of them mention our enemies by name which would make it much harder to sing since our enemies then are our allies now
Brittania Rules the Wave is great too
Never forget:
I disagree, it reminds us of our past and it "teaches" a sense of patriotism which a lot of people tend to lack of in our country nowadays
Plus it is easy to sing, so it is a very good anthem in my book
> It is sad and violent
It reminds us of the harsh reality in this world
We are not living in the wonderland
Yeah, singing "let's kill Germans"  in our anthem would be pretty awful
I understand your opinion
I think we already know our past through history classes, and with a joyful anthem we could also feel united and patriotic
Thanks I'm not dumb - I mean that for a country anthem I think it's inappropriate, that's all
For me, we should be singing about something else than war
I wouldn't laugh if I were you, or you'll end in someone's basement
The hardests choices require the strongest will
Never seen less than three (at the beginning of the summer, I think that’s when the number of variety is the most limited), and the variety differs
We often have goldens, galas and
I think it’s the Braeburn
That, or the Fuji
In winter, it can go up to 10 different kinds
And I’ve once seen a guy, at the local marketplace, whose only product was apples
He had more than 40 different varieties
I was amazed
(Those 40 were only the ones he had at the time, depending on the season he’d have others)
Between 4 and 10 depending on the season in the organic shop I go to
Dude there is so many I can't even count them
Most Aldis I've seen here in Germany are small sized supermarkets for local neighborhood customers
My local has only four registers, and I've never seen them all open at once
I guess that's it
Danke
[Mustard glass] . Basically some mustard brands package their mustard in decorated glasses so everyone has a few and actually use them
There are eve' some wine glasses

The typical [Cocotte-minute] It's a pressure cooker
I wouldn't say  it's only in france but  every houses has a plastic bag full of plastic bags in the kitchen
Same here in France, but I think that’s just my mother
Or not
There is a big jar of bags in our kitchen
My mother literally has an entire cupboard for them, with all kinds of sizes, according to the amount of people who will be partaking
Also some material variations for different cooking methods (open fire for a picnic, oven-going for arròs al forn, stovetop versions with insulated handles, etc)
But then she uses them for more than rice dishes also, like quickly frying up some padrón peppers etc
But this is in València
TIL
Didn’t know such a thing existed, we French people are kind of strange when it comes to cutting cheese -it’s a ritual, really
In French sprays are sometimes called « pshit » and it is 100% because of the noise it makes
In French, the usual way to say "to poop" and "to pee" is *faire caca / faire pipi
* I guess it sounds normal to them, but the syllable reduplication always makes it seem really childish to my anglophone ears -- like saying "make poo-poo" or "go pee-pee".
Little fun fact, in france walkie talkies are called "talkie walkie"
Toilet paper in French is papier toilette
However it's way too long so people use PQ
Literally papier cul = ass paper
I guess it can be pretty childish
In French, some people (including my father), use the term "pilou-pilou" to describe soft, fluffy, fleece-like fabric
It somehow manages to sound both incredibly ridiculous and perfectly appropriate
In french, cotton candy is called *"barbe à papa"* which literraly means *"daddy's beard"*
*Pshit pshit* is more common where I live
Sometimes
No you mean all the time
I have never heard anyone in my life say « vaporisateur »
Fwuck you, meanie
>it sound like a 3 year old using an already childish word
Well yeah
that's kind of our definition and use of english
Isn't english sole purpose to allow the disabled french speaker a way to communicate ? I'have been lied too ?
My former boss, who is German, hates the word handy
He says it sounds silly as well, but I don't see the big deal
I always enjoy words like that
Now I tell my friends that I'm going to "think about my life".
>I didn’t though I was French by accident
Not by accident, ask your mother
I knew her many years ago and we had a relationship
That's how you were born and that's why you call it "pscht pscht". Genetic
"brumisateur" for the water bottle thingy in summer but that's not exactly the same
Un because it’s male for some reason
We say *le pshit* just like *le Big Mac*
Does she speak french ? Because in France we use "fute-fute" to say "futé" (smart, bright)
*Il est pas très fute-fute, non ?*
*He is not really bright, is he ?*
No, even in France we say "téléphone" and not "GSM" it's typically belgian
Yes it is
We have other words for candy (like *sucreries*) but nobody uses them
That's Quebec for you in a way
There is none, we just don’t a neutral gender so we have to attribute a random gender to every word
I understand how it can be seen as ridiculous though, especially since latin did have a neutral gender
And all the french IT guys despise those people trying to force stupid neologism created from nowhere, most of them by a random women in Quebec
Literally anyone who's kind of comfortable in English does this all the time, and I mean all the time as in basically every single sentence
In French an example I have is saying something is "not normal" to say something's wrong or off
The explanation for that mistake is that the word for French speakers and the word for the inhabitants of France are the exact same in French : "français", so we instictively translate "français" by French but it only works half the time
That's not correct in English
Ah, makes me think of José Saramago
Amazing author *when read in Portuguese*. Reading the English translation is unbearable, what with his unhealthy addiction to commas
It is
It breaks the flow of speech
I myself anglicize French words in English to an extent for that reason
It is only you
British parliament is civilized as fuck

You don't need to be popular to win an election, you just need to appear as the least bad option
"Faire l'amour" -> make sex
Make the love in French too
Poppy seeds on bread is delicious, I would say it's quite common to use them
In France its neither (from what I know) it's more of a sign of WW1
We have "romans noirs" (black novels) for detective stories, but I believe that’s as far as colors go
Our crappy novels are called "romans de gare" (train station novels) because that’s the type of book you find in train stations book shops & never read otherwise, haha
I don’t think we have an equivalent for the press
Noir for dark novels or movies, of course, and "rose" (pink) for romantic or suggestive  novels, or tv series, less for movies
For the press, no colours
One colour related anecdote though, the leader of the Tour de France cycling race wears a yellow jersey, because the historic sponsor of the race was the sports newspaper L'Équipe, which was, at that time, printed on yellow paper
Italy El Giro leader wears a pink jersey because La Gazzetta dello Sport is printed on pink paper
For yellow press (I heard prensa amarillista in Spanish), we just say presse à scandale or tabloid
"Romans à l'eau de rose" (Novels made with rose water) for the clichés romance stories
In french, there is the [Louchébem] that was used by butchers not to be understood by others:
First letter go last and is replaced by a L
Boucher = L-ouche - B-ém = Louchébem
&#x200B;
There is also the [Verlan] very popular, where you twist words the other way
Envers= Vers-En = Verlan
Femme = Me-fe = Meuf
I've read the whole thread to see if there were one in French that I just wasn't aware off, and I've seen 0 comment from a French
So I guess we don't have that
It's kinda sad when I think about it, and then I remember I certainly would've been really bad at it so I'm feeling better
> Envers= Vers-En = Verlan
Verlan is the
verlan of *l'envers*:
L'envers -> vers - l'en -> verlan
You forgot the [Parisian argot] and the [Javanais]
When I was in middle school we also had "langue de feu" (fire language/fire tongue)
Same as the bird language described by OP but with F instead of V. It was in the early 00's though, I don't know if children still use it
My aunt and mother once told us at a family gathering they used to speak French with those rules exactly ! It always struck me how fast they could talk while adding so many f's in their words haha
To be fair, before being introduced to the specific words, verlan can't be understood, even by native french speakers
For example "toncar" which is used in weed joints as a filtration material is just a *carton* (card board) piece which has been folded
There's no way you could make the connection before knowing the whole shebang
Not giving up nearly our entire territory in North America for fucking Haiti might have been a good idea in retrospect
The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
By the Edict of Fontainebleau, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches, as well as the closing of Protestant schools
This policy made official the persecution already enforced since the dragonnades created in 1681 by the king in order to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism
As a result of the officially sanctioned persecution by the dragoons who were billeted upon prominent Huguenots, many Protestants — estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 — left France over the next two decades
They sought asylum in the United Provinces, Sweden, Switzerland, Brandenburg-Prussia, Denmark, Scotland, England, Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire, the Cape Colony in Africa, and North America
On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV himself claimed that out of a Huguenot population of 800,000 to 900,000, only 1,000 to 1,500 had remained in France
The Edict of Fontainebleau is compared by many historians with the 1492 Alhambra Decree, ordering the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain; and with the Expulsion of the Moriscos during 1609-1614
The three are similar both as outbursts of religious intolerance ending periods of relative tolerance, and in their social and economic effects
In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a kind of early brain drain, as it lost many skilled craftsmen, including key designers such as Daniel Marot
Upon leaving France, Huguenots took with them knowledge of important techniques and styles — which had a significant effect on the quality of the silk, plate glass, silversmithing, watchmaking, and cabinet making industries of those regions to which they relocated
Some rulers, such as Frederick Wilhelm, Duke of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg, who issued the Edict of Potsdam in late October 1685, encouraged the Protestants to seek refuge in their nations
Not getting Pétain as president, but instead someone that would have not collaborated with the nazis
That France (as well as the UK) should have moved earlier in WW2, to help Poland
We failed them
I know we are responsible, but I still blame the UK (the government I mean, people and government are 2 different things) a bit for not helping when we asked for it, there was no way for us to defend ourselves either after what we lost during WW1
We were so close to greatness so many times
Franco-Spanish union in the war of the Spanish Succession ?
Napoleonic Europe ?
Fuck Prussia, all my homies hate Prussia ?
Put an artillery in the Ardennes to stop the Germans ?
The list is so long
Either the 1789 revolution failed (don't kill me yet) or Louis XVI successfully reached Montmédy (where loyal troops where waiting for him) just to see what would have have happened to France
Maybe we would still be a monarchy
Maybe we would have had another revolution
Maybe Napoleon would never have come to power
Then, no Napoleonic wars
So many changes in history might have occured, it would be quite interesting to see what would have happened
Indeed, this one was unlucky
In Camargue (south of the country) there are [the guardian] , mounting the Camargue horse and working with bulls and horses alike
Medieval knights I guess, there are plenty of famous ones
Also the Dragons, a light cavalry unit under the monarchy, were notoriously used to restore order in rebellious regions by living for some days in people’s houses
Mousquetaires also were famous royal bodyguards
Not a archétype, but in britannia (in France) we got
Zaout = Cow
And zaouter = Cowboy
I know that cause that the name of a mate
I would say medieval knights, especially [The Templars] famous knights of a Catholic military order protecting pelgrims during the crusades
They have a lot of legends around them, such as : "There have been speculative popular publications surrounding the order's early occupation of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there, such as the quest for the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant". Even today, people are still looking for their treasure
Yup, these are our cowboys
They are literally cow
boys
I’d say medieval knights are what most ressemble OP’s description, as well as mousquetaires
Children playing would typically impersonate these, just as they would impersonate cow-boys in the USA I guess
Where is your friend shopping
I live in France and I've been in Paris and in the rest of the country this summer, and I've only ever seen these 50 disposable masks packs being sold for 25€ to 29
99€. I even believed the government had capped the price
Before the crisis a mask costed 8 cts each and now it increased up to 95 cts
Si t'en as plus d'ailleurs, y a une épicerie asiat (Koozo Mart) rue de Lappe à Bastille qui en vend 50 pour 10 ou 15e, j'avais halluciné en voyant ça.
That's absolutely possible
That's true, in the early stages of the pandemic, France didn't have enough masks for everyone (because the stocks hadn't been renewed by the government/the local administrations) and they were only for medical professionals and sick people
We ordered a billion masks from China and then there was this whole thing where other countries were paying more, so the production that was supposed to be for us was redirected elsewhere (to the US and Germany from what I remember but don't quote me on that) so we took a while to finally get masks
But now they're sold in every pharmacy and supermarket
Yeah, at the beginning of the pandemic we didn't have enough masks (we used to have a massive amount for the last pandemic but when it was time to renew the stocks, the people on power were like ":/ that's expensive" so they never did)
The few masks available in March/April were only for medical professionals, so you had to get them online of you wanted some and there was a whole alternative market there
But now they're available in every pharmacy and supermarket and I've never seen them being more expensive than 30€ for 50 disposable masks
(It's not cheap either but a bunch of places give out some reusable ones for free - I know my city sent a reusable mask to everyone back in May)
That's the first time I'm seeing someone on Reddit who live in my city lmao
In France  my students mostly know the picture of the presidents/prime-minister /dictator
Not much else
France wasn't even invited to Yalta
This Western Betrayal thing is so interesting to me
I still can't figure out if it's Russian or US propaganda, but I found it fascinating how much it's believed and how much it's wrong and very very over simplified
Exactly the same in France
>The French Army would defend on the right and advance into Belgium on the left, to fight forward of the French frontier
The extent of the forward move was dependent on events, which had been complicated when Belgium ended the Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920, after the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland (7 March 1936)
Add to that the fact that US condemn France and Uk to invade "neutral" countries
You get the "phoney war".
So technically France had to wait for Germany to invade Belgium to launch offensive
UK had the same issue because their plan was to invade Norway to cut Germany steel supplies
but they had to wait for Germany to invade first before to be able to put there plan into execution
So the beginning of WW2 is Germany putting her plan into execution while allies have to fight with a major trade partner, who has huge business interest with there enemy
remember Germany never paid back nor France nor UK what they ought them from WW1, they only paid interest to US investor who lended them money to do so
Don't forget, business is business
Swiss direct democracy & German bottle recycling system
French protests are often pretty violent and sometimes have questionable motives, especially lately (like homophobia for example in La Manif Pour Tous, or some yellow vests wanting Macron to die)
They often look more like riots than protests
And they cause a lot of damage to property that people have to pay with taxes
I doubt you'd really want that
Swiss direct democracy is working well because Switzerland has a relatively small population
Trying a direct democracy with a population of 65+ million people is suicidal
We expecting a fourth defenestration in Prague
Oh, so the nice version of "Mediterranean people are lazy", got it
You know, sadly politicians still do whatever they like here
Many recent protests aimed at the government were only meant to categorically refuse any kind of change, sometimes using violence to make their voice heard
Both sides are awful
I wish we had more direct democracy in this country
But trust me, French riots are definitely not the right way
It doesn't work and it only creates more hate and division
American what now
No, you got it wrong, Robespierre got them removed was nicknamed the Incorruptible
But then thermidor happened
We have TV pundits and news host insulting Greta Thurnberg for having drinked from a plastic bottle once and telling her to shut up and let the scientists talk ( while not letting the scientists talk much)  mainly
Et vive la France
Depends who you ask honestly
Southerner would tell you it’s Pastis, a aniseed alcohol commonly drunk with water and ice
Normandy would tell you it’s Calvados, some apple tasting hard liquor
Northerners are fond of Picon, an orange flavored alcohol that is generally enjoyed mixed with beer
Behold the glorious drink of the montains : [Génépi] ! Every centenarians of Savoy's secret of longevity !
I won't say we have a national one but each region has is own
For exemple it will be calvados in Normandie (wich is of course the best one)
Cognac, Armagnac, poire, prune ... There are just too many and no one got to be THE national one in france
So you've tested grass before ?
I vote for the homemade eau de vie your grand parents make themselves and serve at Christmas with an alcohol content that would not pass a health and safety check
And there are many many others, like Chartreuse (my favourite), Cointreau, Cognac
In my 15 years in the nord, I've never had picon
When I first arrived here, people wanted me to try genièvre, which I've since associated with the north
And the cider from Britanny
Lol alcohol for a bad stomach XD
Beton <3
Mandatory [*Les bronzés font du ski*] and [*Les tontons flingueurs*]
Aka la niole or gnole or gniole there is no spelling for this
Depends where your grand parents are
My grand father in French Catalonia made his own pastis, I've found two bottles in the village
Ever had a Norman hole
I know that sounds absolutely filthy, but it's very good: apple or pear sorbet with Calvados
In French, it's called un trou normand
You spelled Normandy wrong
Cognac is mostly used for cooking as far as I'm aware
I feel like gniole is the right spelling
Pear seems to be very popular
Have you tried it in hot chocolate
It’s the ideal winter drink
Chartreuse in hot chocolate
Holy shit
I need to try this
enjoy
To write not really because there is no need to conjugate verbs or to be careful of the gender of the words
But for the pronunciation yes it’s still really hard
Well, English is basically composed of French words with an accent and without conjugaison
So pretty damn easy
English is pretty easy to learn
It's probably why it is so used today
It's made even easier by the massive abundance of english spoken media
By far the simplest language in Europe, at least from the standpoint of a native French speaker, aided by an absurd amount of material permeating passively everywhere
I genuinely think of english as one of the easiest language out there
The grammar and conjugations are so easy
The only difficulty is that it is phonetically inconsistent, and even that is easy to pick up
On a personal level, not that hard
* Written English was not a big effort, because of the shared vocabulary with French and the simple sentences patterns
* Spoken English was (still is) where the challenge lies
There are quite a lot of phonemes which have no equivalent in French, so speaking English without murdering the pronunciations required lots of effort, and I still have an heavy accent
Listening is fine now, even with the various accents
Written English is very easy, pronouncing it right is harder than most though
But it's an easy language as a whole
It's just that people don't practice enough due to everything being dubbed on the TV and internet
I wanted to go watch Frozen 2 in English in my city which is pretty large, I couldn't find a single place
Not even subbed English
It was only in French
Ridiculous
Compared to French, I absolutely believe that learning english is easier
For a language whose root is not the same as that of my native language, it is fairly easy, and much more so than German for instance
>For French I had to go out of my way to find content, which I never did, by the way
If you couldn't find content in *French* of all languages, you absolutely didn't get « out of [your] way ».

No more "I'm italian, my great great great great great great grandfather knew someone from Naple" stories
Discussing about races
That actually works in Italy, I believe
It gives you the right to a free baguette and half a bottle of cheap wine
Just because you great great great great grandfather was Irish doesn't mean you're irish
You can say you're of Irish descent, but straigh up calling you another nationality ? Come on, that's like saying you're a cat owner just because your great great great great grandfather owned a cat in his life : It's dumb
And you don't get "special powers" associated to it, you don't automatically can identify good pasta/pizza just because your great great (...) grandmother got fingerbanged by an italian once
Generations ago my great great (...) grandfather came from a jewish family in the north of Africa and moved to France
I don't call myself North African nor jewish by procurration
I was more referring to the fact that in the US, talking about race is something almost everyone does, while in Europe, most people don't believe in the concept of races between humans, and just bringing this word up makes you look like a racist
So we usually just talk about nationalities or origins
And don't forget fucking stones
Not that many, in fact
Lyons got an 's' for some reason, Dunkirk for Dunkerque (close in prononciation) and Brittany instead of Bretagne (which, in Breton is Breizh)
I can't see any other
The other way around, French have translated many names
London = Londres
Aachen = Aix-la-Chapelle
Warsaw = Varsovie
Cracow = Cracovie
Damascus = Damas
Usually french and engish exonyms are pretty close if not exactly the same
Off the top of my head:
In Italian: Parigi for Paris, Monaco for München
In French: Douvres for Dover, Munich for München
In German: Mailand for Milano (I think
), Genf for Genève (although that one might be equally legit)
Omg Florence is Firenze in italian
I'm on this sub since several month and that's now that I learn this
I though that Firenze was just a boring quite big city that we don't talk about much
Yes, same with Pékin, and Cape Town is Le Cap in French
A lot of Spanish cities are Frenchified but I guess remain understandable: Valence Barcelone Seville Grenade Salamanque Santiago de Compostelle  Saint Sébastien La Corogne Pamplonne Saragosse  Andorre Gérone Murcie (city and province) Carthagène Palma de Majorque
The French people stand united with you
(We call Beijing “Pékin”)
Is it frowned upon by Poles to use the German name of these cities
Don’t forget Marseille, it sometimes has an s for no reason
>	Spain=sfarad
Same etymology as Sephardi
>	France=tzarfat
Is the Jewish patronym Sarfati link to France ?
I think we still say Saint Jacques de Compostelle though
Which is weird, because I work in international logistics, so at work, even with french people I would use Beijing, but otherwise Pekin still stands
Woot, from latin Aquisgrana I guess
Forgot Bourgogne / Burgundy
Normandy/Normandie is close enough
We've butchered English place names a lot (think Thames/Tamise) but it's nowhere near the amount of butchering German, Italian and Spanish names, in fact
You're absolutely right
I got mixed up here
Except for like, 1 in 4 road signs to maximize confusion
Sorry I wasn't clear enough :)
I was wondering what your reaction was when a foreigner use the German name
Bath is still Bath
However I am ready to bet they changed Thames to Tamise just because of pronunciation issues
I think we're slowly switching the [French exonyms] we were using to the English names
Even from this list, Cantorbéry is almost obsolete (only elderly people would use it)
Ah thanks
I really was not sure the correct pronunciation was tbh, and I visited London a bunch of times
There are [mappy
com] and [IGN maps] (National Geography Institute)
Waze for driving (but it's owned by Google) or Mappy
fr for planning trips
We have geoportail
gouv
fr that is a public service and is very (like really) detailed
We don't use it on a daily basis as it's not meant to be a GPS but it's a powerful tool as we can get almost any sort of map from France that exist or existed (yes we can explore 17th century's maps)
We use waze more than google maps for GPS but waze is owned by google
[mappy
fr] used to be a good source for France years ago, but meanwhile google (and their service Waze)  really is now the reference
[IGN] has more niche maps, and I just found out they have a [Google maps equivalent]
I cannot emphasize enough how awesome the IGN maps are
You can see extremely accurate topo maps, XVIII century maps,...
Not weird, most of us think it's the same thing anyway
RU in spoken conversation usually stands for Restaurant Universitaire (at least if you're a student)
I disagree, it's pretty common to hear "L'UE" here, maybe it's a regional difference or something
Yep
Very commun in newspapers
France :
1€ : 1 baguette
10€ : 1 Margherita pizza or 10 baguettes
100€ : 4 meals with deserts and a drinks in an average restaurant or 100 baguettes
France:
1€: one cucumber in a supermarket
10€: 2 good Label Rouge chicken breasts
100€: headphones (like Beats)
1€ : a candy bar like a Mars bar
10€ : a pack of cigarettes
100€ : a plane or a train ticket (long distance)
Well you usually have a buy three get one free discount, so it would be 1, 13, 133 baguettes
>For 1 euro you get a box of soft sponge biscuits with orange jelly and chocolate cover
Pim's ?
You can get a « baguette blanche » for as low as .36€ cents I have seen in some big supermarkets like Auchan
T'habites vraiment dans les TAAF ?
We mean baguette from a craftsman, not the industrial mass produced version (although I would admit I enjoyed the Auchan baguettes way too much when I was a kid)
Ça doit être le cas, si chez lui la tradi n’est qu’à 1 euro (ça fait des années que je n’en ai pas vu à moins de 1,20)
elle est à 1€10 chez moi (Hauts de Seine)
la baguette classique est à 90 cents
J'ai vu récemment des 1
05 et 1
10, 1
00 ca me semble pas trop déconnant
F for pranks between friends
U for the union between us
N is for anytime, anywhere
How the fucking hell can I still remember this perfectly ?
F  pour les farces qu'on fera entre amis : Pranks that you do with friends
U pour l'union entre nous : The link between us
N c'est pour n'importe ou n'importe quand au fond de l'océan : Anywhere and everywhere in the ocean
EDIT : [ Why the fuck do I remember this and the exact wording after 15 years and still can't remember my bank account password ?
Au fond des océans
We have some very talented people, and also a very small pool of voice actors that are fucking everywhere and have the most annoying voices
I found Spongebob so fucking cringe and unfunny when I was younger
I still do, but at least I don't want to punch the screen when I hear the voices anymore
we learnt cursive
Later most people write with a mix of cursive and printed
Pretty much only cursive
Cursive first, and much later, printed
between 7 and 12 yo i learned cursive
In my school, some kids write printer like, and some write in cursive, including me
All of the teachers write in cursive
But every documents in digital boards or on paper are written printed like
In kindergarten we learnt printed script (early 1990s) and then in primary school we learnt cursive in my experience
From what I remember I only learnt cursive and I still mostly write in cursive
But we saw printed everywhere so for some letters I picked up the printed form if it was quicker
I can't really explain it kinda came naturally
Also some students have to because their cursive writing is so bad
In France you can't use a computer in class until university and most of the tests need to be answered with written sentences
Also in high school and college the dissertation (French essay) is still really popular and you may have to write several pages on a subject manually so it’s necessary to write fast
We didn't learn it, we just took it to make our writing style more cool/different
also because it's faster for some letters like the m and n
In Paris you might see someone come up to you with a ring asking if it's yours, they'll tell you it's worth a lot of money but they're nice since you "found it together" you can keep it and give them some money as a way to split the worth
The ring is simply worthless
Also the usual, overpriced tourist areas with gift shops and fancy looking restaurants, that's the case in all French cities who attract tourists
Get away from those tourist areas if you want anything close to authentic
In France, the worst scam I know of is the broken rear-view mirror one
Basically the scammer waits in his parked car in a narrow street
When some expensive-looking car pass in front of them they blast the horn, or go out out of their car and knock at your window
Then they show you their broken rear-view mirror and tell you you broke it, and suggest you pay them directly as the repairs are cheaper than the insurance deductible
Don't they just do as if they didn't understand your signs
After all there is not only one sign language
Tasty ? Delicious ? I can understand the distress from feeding from intelligent animals, like pigs, cows or ... octopuses
I don’t eat it and I find eating any animals cruel and unnecessary for me but it’s by no means unusual here
Squid is more popular but octopus is pretty widely eaten too, especially near the south coast
Americans online kicking up a fuss about people eating octopus whilst they happily munch on all kinds of low-welfare, often abused animals is a bit of a joke
It feels weird but there's a lot of things that my compatriots eat and is weird so I'm not judging
And I'm sure there's a region in France where octopus is a typical dish soooo
Meh, show a fish, a real fish with head and tails to an American and he will freak out too
I like it, octopus salad is great
Awesome
And now I’m hungry
It’s common here, you can find it at the supermarket &/or see food seller
We eat them in France, no problem
You just need to be used to it
I understand the weirdness though
They end up eaten by humans, so, not so bright after all
If they were so clever, octopusses on reddit would ask if eating humans sound gross to them or not
And then some other octopuss would argue: yeah but yhey are smarter than monkeys
We don’t do that, I believe, and I find it rather strange
But hey, some people like pineapple on pizza; I won’t judge
We're not though ? You're the one who brought up intelligence into this
Nobody said anything about having any qualms with eating intelligent animals
You know it was a humourous answer, right
What is the "meme region" of your country ?
For example, Florida and Alabama are often "memed" because of the famous "Florida Man" or the incest respectively
What is that region in your country ?
Nord-Pas-De-Calais (or sometimes just the whole north of the country) is our local incest-meme region
It is also the far-right #1 region, which makes it even more fun
Furthermore, the chtimi culture there is still quite strong
(Also Paris when you live outside of it)
Paris
Any cliché about Aosta
I'm suddenly interested in this movement
French guy moving over to Denmark this Fall (found a job there), and one of the things I'm most thrilled about is to finally experience that Dane/Swede rivalry ! From everything I know of it, it sounds epic !
Ah yes the famous *russian minority region*
"United" Kingdom
From what I understood, I don't think that this image is true
The "catapult" (inferior weapon btw) is a too advanced technology for this region
I would have said Bretagne for the alcoholism and independance jokes
And also for the fact the their flag is everywhere for no apparent reason as seen on r/unexpectedgwennhadu
Lille de la tentation
There is also:
\- Corse, for being populated exclusively by terro-independantists
\- Paris, for being populated by assholes and being way too expensive
\- Paris'suburbs, for being a warfield between police and local gangs
\- Marseille, for its mafia
\- Bretagne and Normandie, for their shitty weather
I wonder who decided to create these non existent regions
I think that's a worldwide meme for everyone
You mean Skåne is Southern Sweden ?
Yeah our flag really is everywhere
They even have a fucking sub-reddit for this, that's hilarious
Region name changed recentrly,I believe now it is Grand Nord (Great North)
I think yes,something like that
Maybe "North No Calais", "North without Calais"... I don't even know for sure what it is supposed to mean in french
I live near Paris, I must be a bit biaised on the matters
Pas means strait
Which truly makes no sense as it is, in fact, quite a low region in terms of altitude
It's because highschool students think of the North as "high", which
sigh
You shouldn't let random people choose name for things
I guess we should be happy it didn't end up being RegionMcRegionFace
Good call, thx
Possible
Never thought of this this way
Change a lot of things
Would make sense if it was just the worst curry
Well yeah, that is obviously how people took it
But that's nonsensical,  haut/high and nord/north do not mean the same thing at all
Septimanie would've been a thousand times better than Hauts de France, but I do think Occitanie is the best of the "new" names
Nope, I like my 45 day of paid vacation each year
No, honestly I really would rather go elsewhere, the values and political system as well as the total lack of decent healthcare are a big turn off
Loved visiting it though, people were great and the nature is awesome
Nope
I might visit but I've got absolutely no interest to go there on a permanent basis
The only thing the US has over us is better salaries
And even then their work culture and relationship to the corporate world is toxic
Not a chance in hell
I was lucky enough to be able to move from the U.S. to France about four years ago, and I don't regret a thing
It may sound curt and callous to so quickly dismiss my homeland, but it's really hard to convey just how much more content and secure I feel living on this side of the Atlantic
I'm happy
I live a simple life, and it's been no small amount of work navigating bureaucracy and hustling to get myself situated, but I really feel like I can just be myself and live comfortably here - whereas back at home, the constant anxieties that come with worrying about healthcare, auto insurance, work-related stress, etc
were absolutely hell on earth
I enjoy having friends who pride themselves on being cosmopolitan and engaged with the world around them
I enjoy not having to deal with the prevalence of religion in everyday life
I enjoy being able to be frank and direct, not having to dance around people who feel obligated to be overly chipper and facetious to uphold social mores
I enjoy living in a city rich with art and culture
I enjoy affordable vacations and ample time to use them
I enjoy not having to drive everywhere
I enjoy just being able to drink a cold beer next to the water at the local park on a warm spring day
Living in Europe, I enjoy *life*. I wouldn't give that up for the world
I've lived in the US for a long time on both coasts
I sensed something wrong in the political climate in 2013 and got out
I'm thankful for my own foresight every day since
Live no, but study yes
I mean "comfortable" by the american mentality and the way to live
France is a great country, but still quite socialist in certains forms, that I'm not okay with
My tastes, in music, movies, sports, are more likely to be american than french
I'll love to live during one month in the US, then go back to France, then I'll be able to have an idea by myself about it
I always wanted to travel to the US and do road trips and visit some cities like New York
Then I met my American wife and we decided to move temporarily to the US
I've been here since 8 years now
At first in cities, now I'm in a small town in rural Maine
I love many aspects of the country and the culture, but I do miss a ton of stuff
So I won't spend the rest of my life here
Healthcare coverage, toxic fake workaholic culture, Trump, gun nuts, religious freaks are all big turn offs
It's also a very inward-facing culture, just like France
Of course, U.S.A is such a beautiful and interesting country and I'll be much comfortable
When I was little I really wanted to but the verbal abuse my country and countrymen were subjected to during Bush Jr's Iraq war kinda left a sore spot
Even if I were much wealthier, i wouldn't trade my 6 weeks of holiday for a better paycheck, it's just not worth it
Why would I ever want to live in that shithole of a country where cops butcher  citizens every day, doctors let patients who cant pay die and where elections are bought ?
You're breaking Trump's heart
He wants equal number of Swiss and Norwegians immigrating to the US as the number of Mexicans, even though that number would eclipse Switzerland & Norway's entire population
What is he thinking
25 mandatory by law
14 because i'm supposed to works more thatn 35 hours per week (RTT)
5 thanks to the time I've been at the same compagny (ancienneté)
1 day (this one is bullshit) "local festival" (fête local)
We think it's something we have because years ago an unionist wanted to go to his village festival and we still have it
They are my holiday I use whenever I want
I have the same bank holiday (jour fériés ?) as the rest of France : 11 November, Christmas, 1 of May, 8 of May, 14th of July, 15 of August, Easter Monday
Let's be honest, even if you factor in all the costs of education and healthcare, ***as long as you're average and you don't have anything exceptional happening to you***, Americans still have quite a bit more disposable income
Now whether it is really worth it is another question
I personally prioritize quality of life, which is sadly going down in France
> There are strikes constantly that's so often services like trains, buses, and taxis aren't available
I mean I live in Paris so I think we're the worst at this, but even then, train strikes happen like a couple days a year, buses don't go on strike and taxis might go on strike like one day a year, it's really a non issue
> Pickpocketing is rampant and isn't taking seriously as a crime
Pickpocketing is taken seriously, but most victims are tourists and a lot of them don't even go to the police, and when the police catches pickpockets, there isn't a lot they can do (most thieves are minor, for one)
> People from other countries aren't accepted as part of the culture
[Citation required]
> There is less political diversity
An American saying Europe has no political diversity
Is this a trolling attempt
You literally have two parties : center right and far right
Not the original commenter but out of the first 25 you have to take them all (although I had 4 days left from last year, but I didn't lose them, I just have 4 more days this year)
All of them, some companies allows you to take them the next year
Sometimes you can get your days paid instead of leaving
But for the RTT, if you don't take them, you lose them
My employer this summer was like "hey, you still have 3 days left until the end of August, when do you want to leave
" with one of my coworkers

" with one of my coworkers
In theory I'm supposed to use at least 2 weeks (10 days) as a block during july/august
I've already done without issue 4 weeks (20days) at once several times
But almost all years I still have unused day so before they get wasted I'm not working on friday for 2 or 3 months :D
The public services and health specialists are going to shit, especially in rural areas, and there's an explosion in incivility and "noise" (sonic, visual, intellectual)
That's not even mentioning the entire environment going to shit to the point I'm wondering if I should withhold investing in property and buying in another region or even fucking Patagonia
This is also a thing in France
Basically, you are working one day less in a week
Often it's to keep the kids on wednesdays
For non-French people: until middle school, kids have Wednesdays off (usually for activities)
The drawback is that they stay longer at school the four other days of the week
The housing market in big cities is as bad as anywhere else
Smaller cities are still fairly OK, though
I think if you're smart about it, the best value you'll get is buying around a mid-cized city (in car distance)
No big city problems, affordable cost of living and you still got all the amenities of the modern world
Vert true
We work only 35h here in France and have one of the highest productivity rate in the EU if I'm not mistaken
Well, in some fields (like IT)  we do à lot of overtime though
this can end up in a family discussion where they speak about old thing
i don't have records for younger generation, because i am not too close to them, or "this" didn't happen to my closer 'circle'. But i don't see it as a forbidden subject
I think it's a pretty open subject
My mom has told me about this when the conversation called for it
I'm sure she'd tell all the details to my sister if she asks
It's not a mundane subject (why would it be
It's not every day a conversation calls for the details of giving birth) but don't anyone particularly shies from it
I'm a guy, and I got a cliff note summary of the pregnancy and birth of most my relative, like how fast/slow the labor was
The moment you see your child for the first time, taking his/her first breadth is a magical moment I won't shut up about
For me it would be a good "Quiche Lorraine" or a french taco
France : "[Croque monsieur] It's really easy to make, kids love them too
And you can perfect it with your own taste : specific cheese instead of basic emmental (blue cheese, tome, comté, morbier, et
), garlic and butter, specific ham (smoked ham, etc
), one egg on top
With green salad and vinaigrette of course
For me it's carbonara (with cream, sorry for the sin, italian friends)
[Aligot
] Just look at that glorious, glistening, molten mound of cheesy potato fondu
You can feel your arteries crying out in sadomasochistic pleasure already
Personally though, I'll always be jealous of South Korea and their unparalleled [fried chicken
Honestly ? It has to be two things : a camembert au four (take a camembert, put it in an oven, let it melt, done) with fries or a good old raclette
For most of my generation, probably kebab (with fries, yes I know) tbh
Probably not everyone's choice but mine is definitely a bland baguette
Baguette with a pieces of chocolate inside
It was an after-school classic
My granddad LOVED churros
I’m from Southern France
Every week when my grandma went to the market he would ask for some with powdered sugar on top
I miss him so much :’(
I miss Czech food (and Czech beer) so much
Counting the days until travel goes back to normal again
No pie
Not even a small chicken pot pie or a shepherd's pie
Like, of there's one thing nobody can take away from your gastronomy that's pies
Lot's of 'em
Oooohhh yeaaahhhh
Or Tartiflette !
La Tartiflette
God this makes every long winter night warmer and more homely
Literally never eaten aligot in my entire life
Now I want some
We have this cliché about ice cream, though
Girls are "supposed to" take a batch & eat the whole thing in front of the TV when they’re heartbroken
(Plot twist: we -girls- don’t do that
Nothing beats a kebab at 4 am while drunk
We only speak kebab here sorry
Just say you are from Brittany, the flags are basically the same
There is no eggs in a "French Carbonara", only crème fraiche and lard, maybe topped with some gruyère cheese
I usually do another thing while cooking and would 100% end up with scrambled eggs, so I don't do it
There are some in supermarkets that are surprisingly decent for industrial stuff
It's not the real thing of course but it's decent and gives a good idea of what the stuff is
The best is with a Montbeliard sausage so you can dip small pieces of smokiness into it for maximum pleasure
That's how it's normally served here for too ! It's just that I like to eat some fries with it
Drunk or not, the 4 am kebab is awesome
I'm from Brittany and I approve this message
You should put egg yolk though
Egg yolk is delicious
Hum, I would be so radicla about that
Almost everyone I know put eggs and cream
You need to get the white off otherwise it does coagulate which is normal
If you add a little bit of pasta water, percorino and egg yolks at the same time and stir over medium fire it should not coagulate too fast
If it coagulates it means you left it too long on the fire
You should take it off the fire when you have a creamy, velvety sauce
To be fair that's just what we call it here
It's pretty much unrelated with the original recipe at that point, but everyone in France makes carbonara like the guy above said
It's a "French Carbonara", like there exists an "Hawaian Pizza". It might be heresy to some (many ?), but it's definitely out there
I myself prefer by far the taste of a classic Italian carbonara !
It's far from being as universal as you claim honestly
I did the shitty recipe with cream when I was a student who could not cook properly but the second I tasted the actual sauce I just never went back and I know I am not the only one
In restaurants I would say we on a 50/50 basis between the cream one and the normal one in France
Yeah I'm talking at home, not at a restaurant
It's mostly something for young people and/or people who want to eat something heavy without much trouble, you know, comfort food
It's my analogy for this sub only, to try and not hurt some sensibilities
In France we just call it "Carbonara " or "Carbo".
Germany = Allemange
Netherlands  =  Pays Bas
Noway = Norvège
Cyprus = Chypre
Latvia =  Lituanie
Sweden =  Suède
Switzerland = Suisse
Been looking at the list of all countries to see which one have a completely different name in French and English, i.e., if it sounds different but basically means the same then I don't consider them
So here is the complete list:
* Germany -> Allemagne
in French we call the Netherlands « les Pays-Bas » (literally the Low-Countries) or « la Hollande » but we call the Dutch « les Néerlandais »...
also, even though it’s not really a country but Wales is called « Pays de Galle », I don’t know why
Il like it
Gallum also mean rooster in latin: that's why it's the French national animal
I've always thought it's funny that Germans call France *Frankreich* ("kingdom of the Franks"), which is a bit, well, outdated
and then I learnt that the Greeks (edit: and Greek Cypriots, just saw your flag) call it "Gaul".
Does anybody here call our country "caveman land" or something like that
Or "dinosaur country" while we're at it
Exactly
btw, [UN has 6 official languages] Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish
Wow I never knew that austrians didn't say Deutschland
What's the origin  of Piefkinesien
Belarus: does it translate to white russia ? Do all Lebowski originate from there or ?
Latvia is Lettonie
Lituanie is Lithuania
For the same reason why Spaniards say Alemania and Potuguese Alemanha
>Bheag
Which is that ?
Here is a [chronological statement about use of languages] in UN on Dag Hammarskjöld library webpage
UN creation was about political power, aiming at preventing wars among members
Official and work languages have rather been decided on such a political basis than an economical one or number of speakers, at least at first: example with Chinese language, chosen from the very beginning but at the time related to Taiwan who was then a member of Security Council,  and not regarding mainland China
Ok, what does "little britain" represent the
England ? The easternmost island ?
yes, my bad
woooow okay
There is a very old French pun (hundreds of years old) that has been used by hotels/auberges
It's "au lion d'or" meaning at the golden lion
It's a pun as it sounds like "au lit, on dort" meaning in bed we sleep
Many hair salons in France do that, too
I don't know if it's real, but I saw a photo of one apparently called Niktam Hair
Nique ta mère being French for "fuck your mother".
Au Bureau is also a common name for bars in France, but it's the same franchise that's present all accross the country
[*La Légende des siècles*] (The Legend of the centuries/the ages) is a massive collection of poems (more than 25k verses) by Victor Hugo, described as the last French epic, in which Hugo attempts to describe humanity journey "from darkness to light" through myths and historical events (or rather, the vision he has of them)
Maybe [Les Misérables] de Victor Hugo or [Les Mémoires d'Outre-Tombes] de Chateaubriand but those are from XIXe century so it's not that ancient but still have historical value enrobing beautiful stories
Also les [Fables de la Fontaine] those are pure poetry and are pretty famous
I was thinking _Les Misérables_. It’s hard to pick just one book, though: I don’t think we truly have ONE that stands out for every French
Except if you consider the Marseillaise as a poem
It's probably because the [Chanson de Geste] was very influential on the italian epics that followed, such as Orlando Furioso or La Gerusalemme liberata
I would definitely count it too
Heck, this created a word (and the first meme
If you're out in the early hours of the morning, it's not uncommon to see deer roaming the streets, foxes too
We get quite a few squirrels
Recently, there have been sheep and goats up on the mountain pastures attacked by wolves
Rural France here
It often happens
Foxes , boars , deers , hares and rabbits, small rodents ,hedgehogs , storks , bunch of other smaller birds
I nearly got trampled on by some deer just yesterday but i also life in the country side
I saw a whole family of bunnies on Leipziger Straße once
They crazy
I feel really bad about it
Because we're busy working in December, while during the World Cup we're usually in holidays
Also because there's no reason to host it there, the Qatar national team is unknown and has nothing to do in the competition, they clearly paid a lot to host it
Makes me feel like puking
Many slave workers already died to build the stadiums
I find it revolting that they would hold it in such a country
I hope the fans who will travel to watch games there can live with themselves
I am conflicted on this one
On one side we can all agree this WC is spitting on every human right law that can exist
It smells like corruption 100km away and is overall just bad
However, Qatar is for me special in the way it is one of the only country of the middle east that is actively trying to open itself to the world
It is heavily investing in sport, culture, tourism
For a very secular muslim country, I feel like it does everything it can to broaden itself by other mean than religion
I prefer Qatar to be investing its petrodollar in Football than in financing some shaddy religious expansions
It'd be better if they could not use slave while building their stadium though
For the time slot, I watch a lot of rugby, and big tournaments are not in summer, it usually doesn't spoil the fun
Just like the World Cup in Russia
I'll bitch and whine about corruption and how Qatar has legal slavery
But once it starts, I'll be glued to my TV
This
The non-respect of human rights is the problem, here
The timing is a bother but not much more
Does it matter
Maybe the World Cup shouldn't have been held in Russia, maybe we should all have boycotted it
But that doesn't change the fact that we should definitely be boycotting the one in Qatar
South Africa was in France's group in 1998 and particpated in 2002 too
They are leagues above Qatar's team, where there is absolutely no interest in football whatsoever (stadiums are empty in all events)
I won't watch it cause I can't but if we play another final and have the occasion to get the third star I think I'll watch anyway
I'll most likely stream it with a VPN from a French or British channel
Northern climates put some hard constraints on what you can grow and when you can get it
In the South, if you got water, you have far more options and a longer growing season
I live pretty close to Dordogne, an area where you can grow *anything* 8 months in a year
Contrast that to Finland, for example
Historically speaking : greater diversity in agriculture, trade, much larger economies leading to greater sophistication among the upper classes
People tend to forget it, but until fairly recently large parts of Northern Europe were, let's say, quite boorish
> Different variations of meat/fish and potatos is so good, thats like all I eat
That's the issue
You are satisfied with little diversity
That's a very Scandinavian trait
I ate hutspot last night in Amsterdam and it was very good
Saint-Empire romain germanique (Holy Roman Germanic Empire), sometimes abreviated as simply Saint-Empire (Holy Empire) or even just Empire if the context is clear (ie at a time and place where it's the only relevant empire around)
Normally it's Saint Empire Romain de la Nation Germanique but usually you just see Saint Empire Romain Germanique ( SERG ) or even just Saint Empire Romain
Le saint empire romain germanique
(sacred roman-germanic empire)
Saint Empire Romain Germanique
So yes, holy roman german empire
Apologies for the stupid question, but which language is used when teaching history in Luxemburg
L'empire can also refer to the French first empire of Napoléon, and it coexisted with the HRE between 1804 and 1806
Right, so it wasn't _too_ stupid a question :D
That's fairly interesting
Do all subjects follow this split of German first, French later
The Académie Française is trying to do exactly that, not really working so far
In Québec yeah e.g. there's a low that forbids any brand to have an English name, so KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is PFK (Poulet Frit du Kentucky) in Québec, they use "ARRÊT" signs instead of "STOP" etc
But here not really unfortunately
I try to avoid them when it's possible to use a French counterpart but they are everywhere so it's pretty hard
The french academy is hell bent on finding a new french word for every loanword but that doesn't mean that anyone will use it
I have to disagree somehow
Decades ago, words were created when new concepts appeared, like ordinateur for computer or télécharger for download
I read some computer magazine from early 80's, and they said télécharger was a temporary new world for the concept of downloading (which was actually different back then, but that's another story), but it became the official word for it
It worked for most words of that time, maybe not for brands like walkman
In the late nineties, they started to propose new words years after a new concept or device became popular, and was already known by its English name
That was always a big failure, even more than the names were often ridiculous (éblabla for chat or cédérom)
A few things do exist like texto, but people only say SMS anyway, except maybe old people that don't use them
Even baladeur (word proposed for walkman long after its release) still exists, but the French term lecteur mp3 is much more popular (I don't know if I've ever heard anybody say baladeur)
Baladeur wasn't used for lecteurs MP3 but it was widely used for the CD walkman in the 90s/early 2000s. When I was a teenager we also used texto instead of SMS
Those two weren't big failures but successes for my generation (from what I get from your message you might be 20 years older than me)
> Even baladeur (word proposed for walkman long after its release) still exists, but the French term lecteur mp3 is much more popular
Baladeur didn't refer to lecteur mp3
Most things up to the 80's have a translation that more or less stuck (like "octet" for "byte")
Everything since 00's don't anymore, due to the internet making international notions adopted way too quickly for the AF to step in in time
In between, it's a bit more blurry (like "e-mail" and "courriel" which still co-exist, and was popularized in that timespan)
Because byte can be pronounced like bite in French which means dick
We all use octet but gigabyte or megabyte jokes never fail to make people laugh
I wonder what the impact would have been if French people use byte isn't of octet
Would there be constant dick jocks
Would every French (that don't speak English or is not in tech) have smiled everytime they heard of mega byte and giga byte
Yeah but they say melon d'eau
>it's just going to irritate people
Who
99% of the people in Québec speak French at different levels
Actually, "télécharger" is used for both upload and download which can get confusing
They invented a word for it, "Téléverser", but nobody uses that one
"Télécharger" is used both ways, as it just means "load remotely".
> upload
It's also télécharger
Ja (bocs, **igen**), tanulok magyarul és sok német szó találom miközben mindig gondoltam hogy 100%-os magyar volt (pl

Van is pár francia szó (sofőr, bizsu, butik, amatőr stb
Me too
It sounds pretty more logical to translate a brand name in your language to understand its purpose rather than letting it without translating it
Yeah why
I speak English fairly well, but I always have to stop a moment when I have to use lie/lay
Words a pretty similar and translations in French (in the "lie down" way) are also really close
And don't even get me started when I have to use it in past tense
I mixed up condemn and condone for a long time, before learning they were totally opposite
It comes in lexical fields to me :
is it hard or difficult or harsh or tough or rough or raw or crude well nope homie, it's solid
Yards and rooms and attics and halls
Corridors and fucking closets
Where do these words come from
Because in French a short story is *une nouvelle* and a novel is *un roman*
And in French :)
Same in Navajo
Interesting that the indefinite article is "a" and the plural is "k", it's exactly the same in Hungarian
Jeanne d' arc she was as crazy as she was badass,
even more badass when embodied by a child [
Yeah thats totally fake lol nothing to worry about dont worry
But don't check under her hats pls
It was a scandal for the far right some years ago want a black girl play Jeanne(Joan) during a festival in Rouan, they realy like ruining the fun
hmmm
I don't know but in my class, there are people who are offended everytimes that the teacher is speaking about another country because they think it is racist to say "For example, if we go china, we will don't understand anything".
A large part of the French population has at least some anti-vax beliefs
Same with homeopathy and psychoanalysis, and both can be prescribed by any doctor
There are even quite a few doctors who are anti-vaxxers (the best known being Henri Joyeux)
Former president Sarkozy is a climate change denier
Since European Union has been created as a response to World War 2 to prevent it from happening again it could be argued that anything related to EU is linked to WW2
France also demanded you acknowledge it in order to join the EU
> We ~~still~~ finally love you Germany
You better believe this rosbif, Germany
That's saying a lot !
Stalin even said: " Hitlers come and go, but Germany and the German people remain
>while the 2 nukes dropped on Japan by the USA are overlooked
You're right
I never understood that
Yes, I know, it's just to show WWI effect nowadays
Also my understanding is that the EU never really planned to let Turkey in because it would have too much power (population)) and be too expensive
The idea was more the closest partnership possible without having the Turkey in the European institutions
Isn't it the AKP government which abolished death penalty, allowed Kurds to speak their langage, go to parliament (I may be wrong) and got the openning of negociations ?
As for joining the EU, I am once again very sceptical
Several countries as Germany are very opposed to it
France and I think the Netherlands demanded to have a referendum if the decision is to be taken one day
It would not have been an easy one
The 2004 enlargement of the EU caused many troubles and we are now waiting to reform the institutions before integrating the Balkans so a 80m inhabitants country which borders Syria, Iraq and Iran
You're focusing on the condiment instead of the gas
Almost everytime
As a French, and I'm quite sure other european country does too, we have a lot of clichés that americans think they are real
Sometimes it's juste like "How can you even imagine that ?". At least that's the funny part
It's always sad to see that they mainly refer to others places as if it is the US and don't understand how it can be different
Read the news, open a book, open yourself to other cultures, you'll see that our world is wonderfully different
Even in Europe you can witness so many cultures
I might generalize too much, I admit, but how many time I talked with them and saw that they are really "american-centric" and don't know much about the rest of the world
Remind me a post I made about a Reunion kreol song in /r/listentothis
This is one of the comments
> *An american*: God, these whitie tourists who claim to understand  African culture are so cringy
> I have travelled a lot, these people are obviously social outcasts where they come from, and probably tried these locals out by taking 500 takes so they could pronounce the locals words right and look cool back home ‍
> *Me*: WTF ? They are both french
They both grew up and are locals of La reunion island, that's why the "whitie" speak fluently kreol
> You are the one making a racist assumption
Because she is white, she can't be a local ? Reverse the skin colors, you will understand what's the problem in your comment
> > I have travelled a lot, these people are obviously social outcasts where they come from, and probably tried these locals out by taking 500 takes so they could pronounce the locals words right and look cool back home ‍
> Not enought then
> *An American*: You say they are ‘french,’ I say they grew up in an African island nation colonised by the French empire
That’s like calling someone from Burkina Faso French
I just can’t help but think about the implications of the white crimes of the past
> *me*: Well, they have the same rights as the french people in France so they are french
> No, Burkina Faso is an independant country
La Reunion is a [french region] Just Like hawaii or Alaska in the USA
> You should really travel more
Geography is not your strong point
> *An american*:  Your last sentence is an attack, I still don’t believe that that land is ‘France
’ I was just in the British Virgin Islands, I really don’t want to call that England, and the locals are poor and not supported by England at all anyways
You’re super naive and angry and you should actually calm down and open your eyes to some horrible shit that’s happened in this world
So fucking dumb
just because Burkina Faso has been liberated but La Reunion has not, doesn’t mean they’re both remnants of forced colonialism
You are a sheep
> *me*' I was just in Hawaii, I really don’t want to call that USA, and the locals are poor and not supported by USA at all anyways
> So fucking dumb
just because Burkina Faso has been liberated but Hawaii has not, doesn’t mean they're not both remnants of forced colonialism
You are a sheep
> I guess I have to say to my reunionese friends they are not french then, because a dumb troll on internet said me so
> *An american*: Glad you’re still stressing over this, friend
The Hawaii comparison is poor at best compared to the example I provided
It seems you’re hell-bent on pushing your finger into your ears and shouting so I’m going to walk away, but I just want to say that you should open your heart and try to be more caring in the future, the world really needs it right now
Yeah, I would have given up this conversation before you did tbh
His/Her answer are very strange at the very best
Yeah he/she was upvoted, so I was a little bit angry haha
The world really need it right now
*My country whistling in the back*
We'd never do that here ! *No sir
*, we French don't like to give lesson on how you should live more like us
Anyway, I think most people are doing that, it's just that they (anglosphere) are overepresented here
I use more diverse insults
I can talk about sex in English and French with ease but weirdly when I speak Latvian, I’m just a big prude
Hell yeah
I am much more sociable and at ease with people in English
English is a very direct, free, simple language that allows you to express yourself in many different ways and nuances
French is heavy, complicated, awkward and boring
Fuck that's exactly what I was about to say
And this is why most of my humor on reddit is using memes
Exactement dude !
(Québec me manque, câlisse, là ! J'veux r'venir dans la Belle Province moi !)
Switzerland isn't a reliable example for this
Definitely not same here in France
Germany is notoriously cheap for grocieries tho
Lyon: cold people, great food
Paris: awful people, great place to visit as a tourist, city of love
Marseille: armed robberies, gangs shooting each others with leftover weapons from balkan wars
Bordeaux: bourgeois drinking wine and judging people
Montpellier : Oldest medecine university in France (and maybe Europe)
Berlin is supposed to be poor
Marseille is trying so hard to change its image, then shit happens like the girl getting stabbed to death in the metro station (actually the one that I take every day) and the building collapse
Turku's center is really pretty with well restored architecture
Also, Muumimaailma :D
Düsseldorf : better Carnival
It's mostly stereotypes
I have lived in Lyon for five years and did not find them cold at all, it's just what they are known for for some reason
Yeah, my sister studied there and she was happy, never had a bad thing happen to her but yeah Marseille still has a lot of problems that regularly stain their already poor reputation
Obnoxious football fans too
Hab den Kölner gefunden !
Yeah corsican people have a problem both with italian and french people
It's partly tied to them being islanders and partly tied to their history
It used to be a genoan colony but then they rebelled and kicked the genoans out, the corsican people then wrote a constitution and tried to do their own thing
The genoans did not have the military means to conquer it back but did not want to let it go without making a quick buck either so they sold the island to the french king, who had one of the most powerful armies in Europe at the time, for next to nothing
Then the french king sent tons of men and equipement and crushed the newly minted corsican government and anyone who opposed french occupation and said "okey, this is now part of France, like it or not we don't fucking care".
That being said corsican people can be charming as long as you respect their island and don't act like you own the place, I have been there tons of times and I have family there and I have only good memories of the place
This is one of the places where you can literally get slapped in the face for littering if a corsican person sees you do it as they take the protection of their island extremely literally and they give no fucks whatsoever
But generally if you are respectful they will treat you very nicely
I think that a lot will depends on the reaction of Politicians and people to climate change
Especially to climate refugees tbh
In 20-30 years we will have almost certainly tens of millions of people banging at our doors
From Africa, Middle-East, Asia
The migrant crisis of 2015 was nothing
The other impacts of Climate Change will affect us but not that badly to start with, we will probably be among the last part of the World to feel the bad of it, so, in the near future, the "worst" consequence of climate change for Europe will be the influx of refugees from the less well-off countries
The far-right, anti-european parties, will use it a lot to divide people and push for nationalist policies
It will be a great challenge for the EU
Our politics need to be more social
They need to reduce poverty much more than what they are doing right now because that will be a breeding ground for nationalism, and it can really destroy Europe
We need more equality and a better redistribution of wealth and a plan to welcome the future climate refugees
I think the EU will shrink and we will go back to a EU 12 of some sort
Many countries have shown that they were not interested in the European project nor by respecting basic European laws like an independent press or justice
The EU needs a compass before it goes anywhere,  and adding more countries would be a mistake imh
I'm sure the U.K. bet on the right horse
> EU is already pretty much a confederation
Say that to the eurosceptics hahahaha
What are you refering to when you say "not touching member states internal security" ? Not sure I follow .
Also the EU doesn't follow some of its rules, and that's for the best, like not imposing economic sanctions on countries not respecting the financial equilibrium (like France, for that matter)
Can we vote before imposing this s- on us  ?
It is certainly a good thing that the EU does not allow itself to impose sanctions on sovereign states
There are plenty of backstops, the EU doesn't have the means to pose a threat to any country regarding its internal security
France closed its border with Italy on that predicament, backing its claim with European law
As for the migrant quotas, the fact that they are not respected goes against your claim : the EU cannot impose those quotas on countries that refuse to
You claim that the EU is a dangerous entity imposing its ruling on people and countries when in fact more often than not they don't have the means for the policies they try to implement
And that is the main problem for me right here
There is no EU project if countries go against the EU project
The problem lies more with countries having different views than with a supposedly tyrranic EU
Also, it's always good to remind it, whenever a country chose to join the EU, they agreed to give up some of their regal powers
Not one country has been forced to do so against their will, and many asked for special treatments (Denmark, Ireland, UK)
Its written right there in the treaties that it can
But it wouldn't be politically good, that's why the EU often choses not to
And in some cases it's just technically impossible, like Poland and Hungary having each other's back when unanimity is required to put sanctions over a state
>The EU is currently suing the countries that refused them and might fine them
Would you care to share an example ?
Edit : If you are talking about Hungary and Poland, since 1993 there is something called the Copenhaguen principles, enforcing rules regarding civil rights, the liberty of the press, etc
The EU and the ECJ are trying to sue those countries (that joined long after 1993, so they knew what was expecting them) because they are stepping on those basic principles right now
>Correct me if I am wrong but didn't Franks speak Frankish until 9th century
Not really, no
Areas of Gaul that were properly colonized are now
speaking German and Dutch
But some thoroughly Roman cities like Trier, Aachen or Cologne were speaking Romance well into the 9th or 10th century
Northern France had considerable Frankish influence and it didn't take long until everyone was just called a Frank (and the people South of the Loire river being called Romans), but the language didn't change
There was a lot of Frankish vocabulary that made it into French, but a lot of it was lost from forced latinization (italization really) during the Renaissance
By the way Frankish has **nothing** to do with the phonology of modern French, as some idiot always seems to think so
>My question is how germanic speaking Franks become romance language speaking French
In Modern Northern France Frankish immigration was typically one family and their followers taking over the management of a village
There's just no demographic weight behind it
[A good map of disruption in Northern Gaul] (from Peter Heather's *Empire and Barbarians*)
Note that it's more a map of the social disruption of the 5th c. than it is of anything else
Parce que c'est la langue belle
It's interesting because considering you're a Turk, things happened differently in your country
Nomadic Turkic people invaded Anatolia, and in your culture's particular case, these latest invaders managed to impose their language, unlike the Franks in France
I'm no historian, but there are surely varying factors which explain the difference in cultural dominance
In the case of France, surely the prestige of the Roman Empire and Christianity, and the fact the conquerors were Germanic tribes begging to integrate the  Roman empire, and to emulate it, this favored the preexisting Latin-based culture
The Germanic tribes who eventually destroyed the Roman empire ironically wanted to be in the Roman Empire
I'm no specialist on Anatolian and Turkish history
I only know the Hittites existed and were pretty great, and Greeks/Byzantines were important as well in the region, but when the Turkic tribes arrived in the early middle ages, surely at that time and in that region, it was better to speak old Turkic
Perhaps religion was a factor
In Gaul/France, the Catholic Church and the memory of Rome were so important that Latin-based languages were privileged
Thus the invading Germanic nobility had to convert to Christianity, and learn the local language, and say they were the new Roman Empire (like Charlemagne
Latin hadn't taken *complete* hold of Gaul at the time of the Frankish coup
A lot of areas would have been speaking Gaulish, at least until fairly recently
The transition in some ways actually *improved* the status of Latin, as the status of senatorial families also improved and their skillset was essential
I know it's completely counter-intuitive
The Franks also allied themselves closely to Rome and relied heavily on the infrastructure and administration left behind by the Roman Empire, so Latin was use for much more than just for religion
> When Franks started speaking vulgar Latin instead of Frankish
Depends on the area
But by all accounts bilingualism in chiefly Romance areas (ie Northern France and Belgium) was the norm from the beginning
Places where sizable mono-linguistic settlements existed spread out in a ink spot pattern and form the modern Romance-Germanic border
It seems that there's been a "Germanic revival" of sorts as the Carolingians came on the throne and brought more ~~Austrians~~ Austrasians (ie a lot of Germanic speakers) around
Gauls was an umbrella term, they were a rather diverse bunch
>So people in Northern France considered themselves Franks while still speaking vulgar Latin with a lot of Frankish influances
Linguistics is a recent thing
People didn't really think of languages in quasi-mythical terms like we do
They just thought of it as "their language". So by the time most of the people who saw themselves as Franks spoke a Romance language, they just ended up calling it "the language of the Franks", ie French
You could say the same about Russian or Bulgarians, the Rus being Norse and the Bulgars Turkic
>Are there still some words in French that are of Frankish origin
*Fauteuil*, *écureuil*, *guerre*... I actually love *fauteuil*. In Old French it still looks quite Germanic (*faldestoed*)
It literally meant "folding chair", and by extension a throne
As the "folding chair" in question was a Roman *sella curulis*. See the [throne of Dagobert] Now it just means an armchair
Sorry, Austrasians, not Austrians
Though the etymology is the same
[Austrasia] was the Eastern portion of the Frankish kingdoms that contained both Romance and Germanic speakers
Not much, sadly
I know that the Gauls living in present Aquitaine were quite distinct
They spoke what would become the Basque language, itself being quite remarkable from being outside the Indo-European tree of languages
Likewise, there was cultural differences between the people in Aquitaine and the rest, noted by the Romans, and confirmed by archaeological research
The problem with the Gauls is that they didn't leave nice orderly records like the Romans did
a friend's grandmother is a pied noir, which means she's a daughter of french colons born in Algeria
Her family, like most pieds noirs, was sent packing from Algeria and she has a lot of resentment against Arabs, she considers them ingrates as she believes that the french occupation of Algeria was done with the purpose of helping local population ("we were just helping and they kicked us out" is a sentence I've heard a lot), she also believes the numerous reports about torture and war crimes were communist propaganda
I know old people who still sometimes call some countries in Africa "the colonies" but that's more of a "brain fart" I think: the vast majority don't care about losing our colonial empire
As far as I know, the only ones that lament the end of colonisation are far-right idiots & those who had to leave our former colonies (notably Algeria) when those gained independance
In younger generations: in 2017, during his campaign, future president Emmanuel Macron called colonisation a "crime against humanity". Polls made after this declaration showed that 66% of people under 35 agreed with this view, but only 26% on the right (and 31% on the far right)
Overall, 51% of the respondents agreed (and 52% thought that France should apologise for the crimes commited during the colonial era)
I think that the older generations, let's say the ones who were at least teens in the 60s during the decolonisation, are often pretty defensive when younger generations criticise the colonial past of France
I think that now we are seeing it as something really bad that we should be ashamed of while older people are more in the mindset "wasn't all that bad for the local populations"! I don't want to enter the debate of who's right or wrong on that, but I'll say that from my experience it's generally the attitude of young and old people when speaking about it
I mean, decolonization happened in the 60's when my parents were still kids
My grand parents were also quite young and we never talked about it
As far as I'm concerned, it's really a thing from the past
I am biased, as my family from my mother's side was pied-noir in Algeria and had to leave in the 60s, when my mom was a newborn
Some context to understand how **my** family sees the loss of the colonial empire, notably, Algeria as I think they are from the from the "forgotten settlers".
My great grandparents are from the south of Spain, and left their country due to lack of land
They came to Algeria to have a fresh start, they were poor, well not quite, but they weren't rich either
Both of my grandparents met there, at Sidi-Bel-Abbès, in western Algeria
My grandpa grew up in a small farm, not a big plantation that you usually depict from europeans settlers
Then my grandparents married, my grandpa enrolled the gendarmerie (an army corps that covers the countryside security in France) and then, fast forward, the war came
My grandma hasn't mang souvenirs of the war, she was in "safe place" up north, on the coast
My grandpa didn't talk at all about it
He fought against his brothers (not litterally of course), against what he saw as one people
And the local gendarmes were the ones doing the horrible jobs (by that I mean torture, interrogation, raids
) that were ordered by the french military
How do I know that ? We learn that in school
Anyways
In 1963, my whole family had to, once more, start all over again in a country isn't theirs, they never went the metropolitan France before, they were Algerians, well the old meaning of the word
Then, in France (if you care, my grandpa's brother went to live around Bordeaux, and my grandpa settled around Orléans [you get an affectation when you're gendarme]) my grandparents developped a form a racism, but pure stupid racism, a form of hateful trahison, the feel that they were forced to leave their land, their life, once more
As for my mother's opinion, I don't really know it she always told how my grandparents felt about the war and that whole hippity hoppity your farm is now Algeria's property, but I think she's quite neutral about it, she thinks that "it's a shame, but what can you do, it's done
So as for myself, I think it's a horrible loss for my family, but it was for the greater good of everyone
Colonisation is bad, even if you're not exploiting the natives, leave them bloody alone !
I put an emphasis on the many migrations my family endured to make y'all understand that France's relation with immigrantion is special in Europe
France was and, in a way, still is, and of immigration
So yeah sorry for the long the read and I hope the one guy that read it enjoyed it
Okay so there's a subtlety that needs to be addressed
If you talk about the French Empire, French people will automatically assume you speak about the Napoleonic one, not the colonial era
I'll assume you're speaking about the later and not the former
But I think that older generations and young generations both look down on this chapter of our history
The only difference is that for older generations it can be sometimes be out of racist motives: they view it as the triggering factor for all the African immigration we received the last 50 years
You probably can find here and there some die hard fans of the colonial era of France, but these are extremely rare to encounter nowadays
Although we don't necessarily have all the details, we all know that France should have mind its own business and not slaughter entire countries abroad
If you mean the colonial empire, I (and most other French ppl I know) couldn't care less, but if we talk about the French Empire, I really wish Napoleon didn't fail
Clearly we should've never left Europe (military wise - not exploration)
Except Rassemblement National nut jobs no one misses the colonies no matter how old you are
They don't really care for both i would say
We don't make any nationalist movememnt from that for obvious reasons
As a fellow french I also find it hilarious how the young descendants of pieds noirs seem to think they're somehow of Algerian descent
My grand father, who was born in Oran and left in the 1950s for Paris, says he left in part because he was ashamed of the treatment of arabs .
Mmmhh
I'm not sure about the older generation
I know it's anedoctal, but both my grand parents fought in the Algerian and Indochina wars
They think it was pointless and a waste if time, and disliked the colonial Empire
I don't think the people from 1968 was very fond of the Empire either
Speaking of which, the Algerian war was quite impopular among the french population
For what it's worth former British colonies have all done pretty well, to put it lightly
Bloc  Québécois don't even give a shit about France
I think it has to do with those people that had to leave our former colonies: they are classically right, but not far right, wing
They consider that calling colonisation a crime is akin to calling *them* criminals
They wouldn't go as far as saying that colonisation was good, but they would rather we never talked about it
Edit: the largest group by far, that had to left Algeria, is called the [Pieds Noirs] the Black Feet
If your first name include "ael" as in "Mael", "Gwennael" (with the exception of hebraic names such as Anael) or "gwen", and if your last name ends by "en", "ek". Most likely, you're from bretagne (or at least one of your parent is)
Bretons, Basques, Corsicans, etc have names in their regional languages
For example :
Fanch, Maëlle are Breton
Maïténa, Imanol are Basque
Tino, Vanina are Corsican
May I add first names ending in -ig/ick: Lenaig, Soazig, Pierrick, which means small
My extended family holds the following: Maël, Tanguy, Maïwenn, Tugdual, Aelia
Also if a name starts with Ker
Dead giveaway
If a name is Germanic sounding, probably from Alsace and Moselle
As an exception, because there are always exceptions in French, Michaël isn't a Breton name
It's just a common christian/hebrew name but in English to sound cooler than Michel
> Etxeberria
Interesting how it's francised here ^ ^
It'd be "Etcheberry"
Bavarian tinder’s most common men’s name that are very Bavarian:
Tassilo
Korbinian
Benedikt
Maximilian
Occasionally: Emmeram
Ça suffix
For the most part, yes
But then again German last names are not so uncommon in France, they are not necessarily Alsatian
Especially as the most common Alsatian last names are Meyer, Muller, Schmitt and Schneider, which are all also very common in Germany as a whole
But then again there are other names which are typically Alsatian and quite uncommon in Germany, such as Arbogast, Umbdenstock, Eschbach, Morgenthaler, Ott, Oberlin, Pfeiffer, Schlumberger, Pfister, Pfimlin, etc
etc
These are easily recognisable, they often end in -berger, -mann, -lin, -ster or -ler, etc
, and there is a big chance that people with one of these patronyms will have Alsatian ancestry
I don't know much about people from thé north east of France as i lived in thé north west/north Center most of my life
"Ker" is the "du"/"de" of the breizhonag names (ker rohan -> of Rohan/de Rohan)
> (with the exception of hebraic names such as Anael)
Any example of "n ending names" ?
From my perspective, I didn't noticed that immigrated names usualy end up with "n".
Didn't know that about my family name ! Thanks
I don't know if it was me who can't read after waking up or of it was just edited
But ultimately it doesn't matter
Tassilo is the name of a Bavarian medieval duke :)
Korbinian is the patron saint of Freising (medieval seat of the bishopric)
Emmeram is a Bavarian Saint :)
> Varkevisser
... Pigfisher
Ah ok
Sound like latin names after shaving the -us at the end
Florianus, etc
Well, statistically, if the immigrated community don't isolate itself, the names tends to disappear (as most of the girls from that community that marry a man not from the said community are likely to take their husband's name, so roughly every generation, 1/2 of the immigrant descendants takes a non-italian name)
I lived in Germany for 2 months for a linguistic exchange, it was fucking cool but I was glad to go back home
Moved to Switzerland recently, I'll eventually go back in France but not sure when or if I'll move to an other country
What's that one stupid sentence you know in a language you're not fluent in
For me it'd be jeg er en pølse in Norwegian
Ich bin ein berliner
It’s supposed to be in Cyrillic alphabet but I love « Na dvori shapka garit » which means « on the thief the shapka burns » in Russian which is a way to say that bad deeds never go unpunished
Also « de papegaai zit in de kooi » just sounds so funny to me
It just means « the parakeet is in the cage » in Dutch

Snow, it's pretty rare nowadays but it used to snow a lot during winter
For some reason, eating a "[kouign amann] cake brings back memories of going to the seaside with my parents and buying one to heat up at home, I love these cakes
I was in Brittany last weekend
You bet I loaded the car with kouign amann (I’ve been told you can keep it in the freezer really well and so far, I’m not disappointed
For me it's the old train cars using road tires, called Micheline (because of Michelin tires) that I didn't see after the mid 90s. They had a very noticeable yellow and red color

Hope you survive the cold in Finland, funny how here we describe 12-15 degrees as very cold
Yep that's the origin of it
Almost no building has central heating so it makes living inside a house during winter a really tough one
Huge blankets and bissara do the job though haha
We don't like Eurovision in France, I really don't know why it isn't more popular and viewed so negatively here
As a 25 year old, I heard about it first like 3 years ago maybe and I really don't get the point of it
My personal theory is that we try to not win so we don't have to waste taxpayer money to organize it next year
Even for corrupt politicians this is too useless a spending
I'm confused, usually even if you don't speak the language of the song, you recognize the main message or even just the feeling that the singer wants to convey, by the melody, the intonations, the instruments, etc
Here, I genuinely don't know what is going on lol
I don't know how it's so popular anywhere tbh
We do have a flower like the red poppy : we call it the bleuet de France
It was found at the same time as the red poppy
The association is now for soldiers, victims or pupilles de la nation( orphans of France)
In France, the flower to "honor all the soldiers" is a cornflower
But outside of officials during official ceremonies, almost no one wears one
Not a thing in France although we do have the Bleuet de France, a blue cornflower
It’s not like the poppy though because hardly anybody wears one and you’re unlikely to see one outside of official ceremonies or military establishments
In the UK, obviously we have the poppy and I do sometimes wear one but I’m one of those obnoxious cunts who only wears it alongside a white “peace poppy” which symbolises *all* of the victims of war
The red poppy has become something different
It’s glorifies war and is growing more and more into a symbol of nationalism and militaristic pride
When I was young there were many WWI veterans who would give talks and share their experiences and they were truly hellish
I thought the poppy was a way of remembering all of those young men and boys whose country sent them to die in agony on some foreign bit of land
I thought it was a reminder of why there are no winners in war
Unfortunately we’ve learned nothing and the poppy has become a military symbol that we whip out once a year to glorify an ever-increasing number of deaths, but only British deaths, in wars that half of the time we shouldn’t have even been involved in
We do have the "bleuet", the cornflower, with the typical French blue colour, that is starting to get traction these last years amongst official representatives but definitively not in the general population
Every single village have a WWI/WWII memorial and still have 11 November ceremonies but it is falling out of fashion quickly
Almost nobody besides the mayor and some people in the veterans associations (which are getting fewer and fewer) still attend those, while the 8th of May and the 11th of November remain off work days
Maybe it should be transformed about general peace or something more than about dead soldiers rememberance, because as generations pass a vast majority of people are disconnected from that notion nowadays
Especially when you consider that a good chunk of the population originates from people arriving in France after WWII (Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, Africans, south-east Asians
), so without direct connexion to those memorials (former colonies excluded of course, whose soldiers were the first in line and are often without recognition)
We wear them at school just because there’s and internationals english section
Otherwise nobody does it here
Now kiss
I feel like Czech Republic has a more badass effect than Czechia
Just my opinion though
I always prefer the shorter version to the longer one
And it sounds better in my opinion
It's Tchéquie in French (République Tchèque), I'm not sure if I find it atrocious or not
Same goes for France, "Tchéquie" is more widely used than "République Tchèque"
I think it's because in our language, the standard is still "République Tchèque", and the word "Tchéquie" is still seen as a bit weird
Based on the other answers, it seems that a lot of countries were already using the short name in their respective languages
**Edit** : I just noticed that the first "*e*" is not accentuated the same way in both forms
Most likely yeah
I didn't realised it was renamed "Tchéquie" until last year and the name changed occured in 2016 I think
I feel like Tchéquie sounds more of a city name more than a country name
No idea why I feel this way though, Italie sounds fine as a country name
But anyway I don't think Czech people care about what we think about their name change haha
...maybe ;)
The blue one, with three golden fleur de lys
[Flag]
Is it lame if I say that this flag is my favorite
totally agree ! the fleur de lys aesthetic is really neat
The Soviet Union one
You have chosen the right side !
This one was
Another version of the kingdom's flag, during the same era and after
White is associated with the royals, I prefer the blue one, and three is enough
The other one is a pattern wallpaper at this point
This is our true flag
Not this plagiarism of a tricolour from the Netherlands
The fleur de lys is associated with the monarchy but so is the white colour
On point
The white one is the Bourbon branch
I prefer our kings from the Capetian main branch
Philip August among them
the ironic thing is that the white came from jeanne d'arc banner where the background was white
Jalousie et envie, different words, different meanings
We have jalousie and envie, pretty similar to English
I heard it defined thus once: envie is, I want to have what you have (envie means a want)
Jalousie is, i want you not to have what you have, so it’s a bit more malicious
Jalousie/envie
The English took it from us so they're similar
I agree with you
Unfortunately so many people are not using words for what they mean
If jealous of something or someone it’s just dark thoughts towards it
If envious of something or someone, you can do something about it
Sometimes it can even be admiration
Yes and no
There are around 20 regional languages in metropolitan France (60-70 in our overseas territories), from a lot of language families: gallo-roman, germanic, occitan, celtic
I made [a comment with more details] a while back
The issue is that France strongly (and successfully) repressed those language in the second half of the 19th century
At that time, French was the native language of only half the population of France
Nowadays, 6-7% tops of the population knows a regional language, and almost no one has one as their native language
Think about Switzerland: 4 main languages, and a ridiculous number of accents and dialects
Now think about how big Switzerland is, especially compared to Russia
People might disagree but to me french is totally uniform in metropolitan France
I don't believe we have regional accents but for sure people in some regions use some words or remnants of dialects time to time that others regions don't.
French Canadian ( Québécois ) is french with a thicc accent and use of differents words for some things
I don't really see it as a dialect tho, more as a sister-language kind of
Just to point out that there _are_ dialects in Russia (I only know of those of the indigenous peoples, so that’s what I’m talking about)
I believe they’ve been rather heavily repressed when the USSR was a thing, but I’d need to check my notes on that
I’m curious about the way those are counted
There are lots of dialects in Britany, but they share the generic name of Breton: are they counted as one language, or as several languages
Woups, I answered to the wrong comment
They’re languages, my bad
Pfizer
BionTech was in the news plenty when the vaccine was announced and it's pretty well-known that the lab was a German one, but we do call it the Pfizer vaccine
Similar to how Hyperloop One became Virgin Hyperloop, the money often dictates the name
We either call it Pfizer BioNTech, or more frequently only Pfizer
Usually Pfizer/BioNtech in decent medias but people just shorten it Pfizer
Probably because it's the first part of the name and it's a famous already known company, unlike BioNtech
I also assume people would trust more a big famous name than a small company they never heard about
I don't think we care much if it is american or german
If it were Sanofi we would care a lot probably though
Both party were required to have this vaccine but I mostly attribute the science breakthrough to Biontech
The big difference is that Janssen belongs to J&J.  BioNtech is independent from Pfizer

French here our national sport is off course going on strike
Even our national football team did it during a World Cup
Huh, I’m surprised it hasn’t already been said
Rioting
And if you disagree I’ll flip your car
If there was a complaining championship we'd be 1st by far
Revandicationfu, France will win, or go in the streets until it does
On a serious note I'd add Pétanque to the olympics, pretty much an assured golden medal
We also went on strike the day IOC inspectors came to Paris to evaluate its hosting candidacy
That was embarrassing
Hum, hello [
I'm sure the national tradition here would lead to strong competition
Of course you would win, other European countries never got to practice this sport due to the fact our cheese is too good to waste ;)
Then maybe just car flipping

Isn't Captain Haddock Belgian
Actually there is debate
He's living in Belgium, but his ancestor François de Haddock was a navy captain of Louis XIV, and Captain Haddock's own hat/cap looks way more from the French navy than from the Belgium navy

"Chasse, pêche et traditions" (hunting, fishing and traditions) also called "Mouvement de la ruralité" (countryside's mouvement)
I don't need to explain
We have a party which used to be called "Chasse Pêche Nature et Traditions" (hunting - fishing - nature -traditions), now called "Le Mouvement de la Ruralité" (Rurality's Movement)
Beyond being yet another beacon for conservatism, traditionalism, euroscepticism "and stuff", it's mostly known in France as a relay for (your casual) hunter or fisher lobbying
Saying they're not at the gates of power is an understatement, if you mind
Le parti de la loi naturelle was a political party in France

In france, in tgv there is a quiet zone in first class, you need to book it  and it's the same price than the first class ticket
There is a business zone in first class too wich is quiet
But generally first class is quiet because it's made of small zones instead of a full wagon with dozen of people
We also have specials place to use your phone so you won't disturb other people, with a desk if you need it
In some tgv a "family place" can be book: your kids can make noise there
We have the opposite
You're supposed to be quiet all over the train, making your calls in the space between the cars
It's also generally considered bad etiquette to be loud/chat on the phone even in second class
It's not necessarily a rule but you might be asked to shut up or get death glares
That's mainly for TGV though, it's less the case with local trains
Yes, especially because for both first and second class you can find small spaces and the end of every wagon (near the doors of suitcase space) for phonecalls
My favorite city in France is St Malo, just next to the sea with a beautiful architecture and a rich history
Also I am nostalgic
Well, maybe not favourite but underrated,  I would say Strasbourg, France

), French do not seem to have discovered the Alsace region for themselves yet

The French meme game on Twitter is really strong, the most popular meme when I quit it was [this one] And we have plenty of specific French memes which I like better than English one because they're generally more relatable
On Facebook, we have things called "neurchis" where there are plenty of OCs about different themes and they're generally pretty good quality
However if you're not well versed with the theme of the "neurchi", you're gonna be lost really quickly
On Reddit I'll [let] [you] [judge]
English memes are better , french memes are specific of us , and the concept of a popular meme format don't exist
r/rance
LE PAIN AUX RANÇAIS FDP
On non reddit we have this
Pretty strong meme game
this sardoche one makes me laugh
every
time
Neurchi de Tintin is probably my favorite, it gathers tons of Tintin memes
We also have David Goodenough, who apparently is known outside of France for some reason
There's not really much else on Reddit apart from maybe /r/franse but it will not help you learning French
Go on Facebook and search "Neurchi de". It's where the gold is
Personal faves: Neurchi de Tintin, Neurchi de memes historiques, Neurchi de Memes décentralisés pour provinciaux et francophones oubliés, Neurchi de memes extra-muros, Neurchi de commentaires, Neurchi d'escalade soudaine, NEURCHI DE DINOS
The problem with r/franse is that French language here is deliberately wrong in all the worst ways possible
Not a good idea to use this as a learning tool
You'll probably be better reading French/Belgian comic books
Also watch some French cartoons (try Last Man, it's very good)
There are also French movies, but most of them are garbage, or at least for a very niche audience
How do you use such filters
I grew up in the Somme so we went to visit one of the sites of the WW1 Battle of the Somme, specifically the memorial for a Newfoundland regiment that fought there
It was incredibly interesting because they keep an entire trench network (shell craters included) just as it was during the war and you can walk in them freely
What shocked me was how close the German and Newfoundland trenches were to each other, it varied a lot but at some places there were no more than 20 meters or so between them
To add to the realism it was raining hard that day, it really made you realize how miserable it must have been for the soldiers living and fighting in them everyday, I was actually burning with fever the next day
[Here is a picture of the place for reference]
Verdun
We even got to meet and briefly talk to a WW1 veteran (yes, this was in 1994)
Having travelled around a bit, I can say I am proud that we're using this sad past to solidify peace and friendship between nations

My mom is a nurse, so she began explaining some stuff when I got my period, she even made a doodle so i could properly understand

When I (22f) got a boyfriend (my fiancé now) at 17 I ask her to call the doctor to have the pill, she bought me condoms and asked my boyfriend (he was also virgin) to make blood tests to make sure he was clean
I’m really happy that I’ve always could speak with my mom about it
My dad doesn’t talk about it with me, but he has brought me condoms without problems
It's actually true

It's not really about my country but I heard an interesting trivia about Poland
During the Napoléon Era the polish were quite supportive of him and were great soldiers under him
Haiti was a colony of France and wanted the end of slavery and their independence
Napoleon sent troops and among them a polish legion, but they felt the similitude of haitans's situation and theirs (Poland was between Prussia and Russia and was for a long time occupied)
So they revolted against Napoléon and helped Haiti gaining their independence
They are even called black in the first haitan constitution and the first head of states called them "the white n**oes of Europe".
France and the Netherlands share a border [in the Caribbean]
This is one of the reasons why the Schengen area is a good idea
Imagine the nightmare of border patrol there

I'm glad to see that it's taught in school, in my eyes it's really impressive that polish had the empathy and the courage to sacrifice their well-being, potentially the independence of their country for their idea
French-German here
I struggled a lot with my national identity growing up, not knowing which I was supposed to be, but my (French) dad cleared it all up with this one sentence I’ll never forget: “You’re not half German nor half French, you’re 100% German and 100% French, and you should live your life like this” that kind of cleared stuff up
Today I don’t really care about how people perceive me, because I feel a stronger tie to the EU as a whole, because that’s the one thing I’m absolutely sure I am 100%. If I HAD to answer the question Id say I do feel more culturally French, because I was raised here most of my life
My mother was born in Spain, my father in France
I was born and raised in France
Half of my family is Spanish and I saw them regularly when I was a kid
I feel close to them and their culture, but I never considered myself Spanish
I don't know the language (my mom tried to teach me but I wasn't very receptive), I didn't experience living there and the surrounding culture is different
It's part of my history and legacy, but it has barely any significance in my identity
I'm pro Europe, so it's nice to have this multi national history but to be frank, almost everyone in Europe has some kind of connection to another country if you go back a few generations
I’m half French and half British
When I’m in France, I feel too British/English
When I’m in England, I feel too French
I feel like an outsider wherever I go
I speak both languages but you can tell from my accent that I’m not “properly” French
I started schooling in France when I was very young but moved to the UK after a couple of years
I didn’t speak much English when I arrived but now I speak better English than French
I’ve spent the odd year back in France as a teenager but I went to university and started my career in the UK
I try to split my time now and it was great when I was working remotely so I could live anywhere but now I spend about 4 months in France every year and the rest in the UK
Honestly, I hate it
Especially since Brexit, I can feel a lot more hostility towards me being British despite the fact that *I didn’t vote for it, the vast majority of people in my region didn’t vote for it, and I literally don’t know a single person who did
I feel kind of like a fraud to say I’m French or English
Atop of that, I’m Jewish, I’m from quite close-knit communities (which I deeply adore) and so we’re treated a lot like outsiders regardless of how long our communities have been here
We’re still seen as kind of
suspiciously foreign
I doubt it’s a good thing for the community but I’m actually really glad for that though because it means I can be surrounded by other people who are seen as “not quite French/English enough” despite being there their entire lives
It’s definitely true that there are bonuses of sitting on a fence between cultures
I get the best of both worlds and I am deeply attached to both
It’s just a shame that sometimes it feels like I’m not a legitimate part of either
I have an Italian father and a French mother, born and raised in France
I clearly identify more with my French side as I wasn’t raised with the italian langage and culture around me, and even though I’m still interested in Italian culture, history
I would never claim to be french-italian, something like that

And that's how we later created England and a rivalry that started countless wars and deaths
"Surely it would be a good idea to help the United States win their independence war and be freed from Britain, no way this idea can turn against me" Louis XVI, probably
[Saar offensive in 1939] France could have end the war early but thought it was a Germany's setup
Althought germans were just busy invading Poland and western front was genuinely wide open
"Surely this random guy won't recognize me and my wife" Also Louis the XVI
Wasn't Russia's shitty performance in the Winter War due to Stalin murdering all the competent military leaders ?
Did Czechoslovakia really have a choice in the matter ?
It makes me think of a question I have for british people : in english class, when I was around 11yo, we were taught that, on the phone, british people don't answer by saying hello but by reciting their phone number
My bf had the same lesson
I've always wondered if it was true
Can someone help ?
I had a teacher telling us that we should use and abuse tag question, also strongly emphasize them with an intonation
She was adamant that all English people talk that way
I later realized that this cunt probably wanted to makes us sound like a bunch of posh British aristocrats and she was having a lot fun with this, isn't she
I was told by my german teacher that german speakers answer the phone by saying their full name instead of just "Hello" which is more practical than "Hello" "Is this Bob
" "It's Farenknight" "Who ?" "IT
FARENKNIGHT
" "Far a kite ?"
Is this true ?
I was taught by every single English teacher that a notebook was a *copybook*. I live in London and no one in the UK have ever heard this word
The noun "a kiss" is indeed *un baiser*, but yeah, we use *embrasser* for the verb
However, there might be regional variations: for exemple, Belgians use the verb *exciter* to express enthusiasm, but in France it is almost only used in a sexual context (*ça m'excite*, would mean "I'm excited about that" in Belgium, and "That makes me horny" in France)
(that's what I learned in Belgium a decade ago, if someone from Belgium could confirm/infirm)
Your teacher must have been pretty old, since the shift in meaning is due to Marquis de Sade who died in 1814
I don't even know what a 'tag question' is supposed to be
I use them naturally because when I don't know a word in English I just anglicise the French one and that's probably why people thought I looked weird
Of course we use tu, we ain't gonna vouvoyer our family/friends/SO etc
Vous is for a stranger, someone higher in the hierarchy (and even then depending on your job it's not always the case), a teacher, someone you've already seen but don't feel too close to (depends on a lot of things actually like age etc) and obviously to a group of people
More like "J'sais pas" or "Chais pas", or even "Ch'pas"
"J'ai pas" means "I don't have". What you should say in your context is "Je sais pas" or short J'sais pas".
"J'ai pas" means "I don't have"
We'd say "je sais pas" (pronounced chépa, written jsp when texting)
On the opposite, if you drop the "pas" and not the "ne" (e.g. "je ne sais"), it's considered highly archaic and so formal a president wouldn't even use it
I think it comes from the guy who invented this (László Bíró, whose name means judge in Hungarian) but it definitely isn't used in any country
It's the other way around, inversion looks cringe, we use the first one all the time
You're mistaken
"Intonation" and "Est-ce que" are the most wildly used, Inversion is very formal and never used with tu
I'm really curious, on top of what the other commenter said, don't other languages have the intonation thing for questions
I use it even in english
AH ! I knew it ! Thank you for answering !
Oh, it's just "hello"... Each time I have to answer phone from an English-speaking person, I always go with the French "Allo", then remember that I'm fucking stupid because I'm not talking to a Frenchmen, then I panic, and THEN I manage to say something normal, like hi or hello
It must be confusing as hell for the other person
Well, answering phone is already difficult in my own language so in doing it in English can be difficult
Ahahah I never thought about it, but indeed it sounds like this for me as well !
In France, we say "Allo"
Ah good to know ! thank you !
>I also remember learning this, although only the older English teachers thaught this
My teacher was pretty young, around 25yo I'd say
And she was quite firm about this
When we would practice our english by answering a (fake) phone call, WHAT A BLASPHEMY IS WE SAID HELLO BEFORE THE PHONE NUMBER !
Thank you for answering ! It's really interesting, it actually makes sense
In France, if i remember well, you had to put money before calling, so maybe that's why we didn't have such thing
No I never said that using it is what make it sound posh, it's more abusing it and strongly emphasizing it
Throwing a 'innit
at the end of your sentence very naturally to get your point across is obviously fine
Saying it for no apparent reason with a a lot of exaggeration is something else, we definitely sounded like we were cosplaying an 19th century tea party
*The weather is lovely today, isn't it
*Yes, we were thinking about hiking earlier, didn't we
*I've lost my dog today, didn't I?*
Mi nem is tanulunk semmit a mi olimpiai játékainkról
I think I haven't said "ne" ever
Oh you absolutely spelt it wrong xD j'ai pas means "I don't have (it)". J'sais pas on the other hand does mean "I don't know"
Louis XIV is that you
So it's really something old people used to do
Thank you for your answer
Ah I didn't know it was a thing in other countries ! Thank you for telling me !
Got it, so I can throw a very exaggerated tag question at the end of every sentence and definitely sound natural
>Enunciating anything in an exaggerated way can sound pretentious
I do agree that this was probably a bigger part of the problem rather than the tag questions themselves, the way she wanted us to pronounce them and using them in very short succession was what sounded weird
My examples are not out of the ordinary when taken individually, but those were all in a row
If you tell me that it's completely normal to have a conversation with 20 over the top tag questions in a row I would suspect that you're conspiring with my teacher
I don't really like the French names for a lot of cities
I mean, I like the famous ones like Paris, Lyon, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux (and Rouen, Reims, Nantes and Caen, only because it's funny to hear foreigners pronounce them badly)
However, a lot of cities and town have "sur" and "lès" in them, like all these towns: maizières-lès-metz, Montigny-lès-Metz, Moulins-lès-Metz, Longeville-lès-Metz, etc
It gets very confusing which one's which
Maybe it's because we have a fuckton of commune, So it's hard to find original name
for comparison :
France : 35 000 communes
Germany : 11 000
Spain and Italy : 8 000
Belgium : 600
I agree, lots of places have super long names like "Saint-Aubin-les-vallées," "Mossigny-sur-Seine" which can be very annoying when trying to travel in the countryside ("What do you mean ALL the villages have 'sur-Marne' in their name
At least you can help locate yourself thanks to the geographic peculiarity included in the name lol
I don't find it ugly and quite like it, but everyone has different taste
But it's definitely super annoying
I'm from Bretagne and I'm currently living in Alsace and I can't relate to what you are saying, it seems like a myth I see only on Google maps (but I can't help but think "wow
Really
" when I see the names of cities in Ile de France for example)
I don't know about basque or corse cities but the name of cities in Bretagne and Alsace are really typical from these areas
I know that in Bretagne some of the names have been made more French (Morlaix is Montroulez in breton) and let's not talk about how every small town begins with Plou- (Plougourvest, Plouezoch, Plougonvelin, Plouvorn
In Alsace, as far as I know, the traditional alsacian names for cities have been replaced by more germanish interpretation of these names
Most of French people are making fun of the name of cities in Alsace (Schiltigheim, Illkirch Graffenstaden, Souffelweyersheim, Pfaffenhoffen
) because they seem really absurd
But I like them, I like how the name of cities in France are different from a region to another, it's really cool and varied
We do have a city that’s called Condom, and that is priceless
To anyone wondering: Condom is the French name, and it’s not pronounced the same way the English “condom” is
Still funny to me, but my humor is pretty lame
Because your u with dots is pronounced exactly the same as our u, so it's not that hard to get right
However it's always kinda hard to pronounce your "i" without the dot
(Great people and food btw
As a French, I prefer to say Valencia, because it sounds much cooler but mostly because we also have a Valence in France and it can be quite confusing
I hope I will be able to come back to Valencia for the 2021 Fallas !
North Finistère, right ?
But honestly names of cities in brittany are just so cool, and not just the "plou" one
We have quite a lot of individual villages, much more than 35 000
Also, I’m about sure there is a political question here (if you regroup communes, you fire staff)
Really
Is there a specific reason to this
And I do enjoy the fact
This made my day (night
I’ll have to look these shops up to see if they still exist
Also, let’s be clear: I do not have a condom obsession
But I’ll be going through a German year in a week, as part of a two-week exam, and I don’t know shit about German
But now I know how to say condom
THIS is what I truly find hilarious (in a desperate kind of way, ngl)
A common nickname for Marseille in French is "the Phocean city"
I highly doubt that this comes up in my exam anyway, but thanks for the head up and I’m always happy to learn, so: nice :)
Creuse, Ardèche, Lozère, Cantal
Very rural, hardly any city worth mentioning
Fantastic places to go if you like quiet holidays
Littéralement la “diagonale du vide” au centre de la France
I know it's (probably) not the etymology of the word, but it's worth noting that *Creuse* literally means "hollow". Talk about being self-descriptive
The middle of the triangle of Toulouse, Clermont, and Montpellier is quite empty in terms of population density
Le Puy is pretty much the only city
There is a lot of farmland and middle mountains
It’s called “les landes”. It is quite desolate but on a smaller scale than what I previously mentioned
Elle porte bien son nom
True
To this day, one of my best summer was spent in Cantal
I love Les Landes and spent many summers there but it is true that the coast is basically the main attraction, not much else to do
It has been back and forth over the span of the last centuries
Peasants moved to plant jobs in the cities in the second half of 19th century
Then 1st half of 20th, people in the cities felt the scarcity of food during wartime (and after), they were more likely to be bombarded too, and as the railway improved, some plants moved to smaller cities and plantworkers with them
2nd half of 20th, huge move towards the cities for white collar jobs and now in the 21st century there's a new trend of going back to village life, raising chickens and veggies while working remotely
It started before the pandemic but it was only a thing among high-earning white collars who believe they had bullshit jobs, but with the pandemic the trend has spreaded greatly
Kinda the other way around, more and more people from big cities go to the countryside to live more quietly
That's pretty much how it works
And the young very educated elite go to the US/UK
Young move to cities for uni and work
Families move from cities to suburbs for extra bedrooms at lower price
Retired move from suburbs to (sunny) countryside for quieter life
That's usually the pattern in the West
It's a hexagon lol
"la diagonale du vide" (empty stripe) is more accurate than empty center
The low population density in those areas is even more striking when you go to Germany or the UK
In corsica every road sign is riddled with bullets holes
That makes every sign scary when you don't know it's just a corsican thing
They shoot it for fun or target practise
Naturist beach signs
Nothing is more terrifying than a landscape filled with old naked german and dutch couples
I'm still having nightmares at night
We call these beaches: "Teutonic BBQ"
Most scary was in Scotland at the entry of fields
It was something along the lines of « dogs who scare cattle can be shot »
The ones about buried explosives from the world wars in the forests near the German border
You don't want to step on a mine do you
> Warning: falling cows
That's a cool sign, but what are you supposed to do
I'm pretty sure those things fall down fast and hard
It’s mainly a way to show French government what they think of it
Corsica wouldn't be Corsica without the bullet holes
Isn't it pretty standard everywhere ?
Alvin and The Deadly Chipmunks
Oh hey, me too
I was 5 years old and a complete stranger put his leather jacket over my head so I would be protected from any flying glass
Thanks, kind Mancunian fella
yeah also
Corsica is our Texas, many of them have guns, legally or not
A corsican friend of mine who is also a hunter told me that as kids they would do it for no reason, it's just a sport now
I think you never hear gunshots in Corsica too, you just have evidences it happened
In the whole country you hear gunshots during the hunting season though
Yeah we definitely have those in France
Could be just a UK and France thing though
I would absolutely try and hand feed a squirrel ngl
Really helpful, thanks
It's the most popular sport in the South West, even ahead of football
Everywhere else, it's relatively popular (more so in big cities like Lyon and Paris which have good clubs), but nowhere near football
It's quite popular in France , but not as popular than [Football] (or soccer for USA)
Saying that football is almost non existent is a bit far-fetched
You'll sure find cities where rugby is more important but football is still strong
Toulouse does not have the best football team but they're still a regular of Ligue 1 or a strong Ligue 2 team, a lot of cities where football is more prominent can't say the same
Yes
I'm not really keeping up on rugby news but I know that Toulouse and Toulon do great almost each year
It's quite popular, I think like the 5th or 6th sport with the most members
Hey, Portugal made it to the 2007 World Cup
Pau, Montauban, Albi, Brive, Agen and so on, you can't say these are some strong football places
Hell even here in the Alps rugby and handball (especially because of the club of Chambéry) are somewhat more popular than football
Of course football is a strong sport there, sure Rugby is very popular in those places, sometimes more, and there's a good share of the local population playing it
But from that to say that it's almost non existant it's very far fetched
I can talk about Pau if you want (since I'm from there and played my fair share of sports in the region)
Rugby is popular, the Section Paloise is well-known and liked, attract players from everywhere and stimulate neighboring town to have their own Rugby clubs, etc
But still you'll find more people playing football in Pau than rugby, because globally in France football is the go to sport
I don't, I only refrigerate the milk when it's open, it's not fresh milk like is some countries, so we can keep it weeks out of the fridge
Virtually unheard of in France a few years ago
But in the last 5 years or so, it is becoming totally acceptable
I have done it several times (especially with my kids)
It has never been a problem
It depends
Doesn't happen in gastronomy restaurants (it's not like the quantities are too big), it wouldn't be elegant
Same in all you can eat buffets, because you can't take food home
In other restaurants it's common to have doggy bags
Isn’t there a law about it now
I vaguely remember something like that from a few years ago, stating restaurants have to give you leftovers if you ask for them
Yeah, especially in Pizzerias: my girlfriend has a really small appetite so instead of leaving half of her pizza uneaten she asks to box it, and eats it the next day or at work
It really depends on the restaurant, though
In lots of places you’d be looked at you real funny (and then the people running the restaurant would probably accept that you take things with you, but still be uneasy & think that you’re super rude)
Honestly, I’d have gone we a “no, not a thing at all”.
The few times I’ve asked for my leftovers to be wrapped, waiters and chefs were more than happy to comply
They felt it was less waste and a true compliment to their cooking
I believe so yeah, restaurants have to accept if you ask
Yes, in France it is now required by law that restaurants offer you to package your leftovers for takeaway
The difference might be that they has been lots of talks in France in the past few years about food waste
Supermarkets are forced by law to reduce waste etc
This has had an impact on restaurant
It's a pretty positive move
It's not common as portion sizes arent that big in France (quality over quantity)
But it happens
Restaurants have to accept and they generally are happy to oblige
It mostly means "I'm full but I really liked the food and want to bring leftovers for later".
Except in All you can eat restaurants
Obviously
Culture
As far as I can see, serving sizes have not changed
We use AZERTY
[French azerty]
We have keys with é, è, à, ù, ç  and a \^ and ¨  key for ê, â, î, ä, ï, ë etc
The number row is Inverted
To type numbers, you have to press shift key
It's just a matter of what you're used to
I'm used to AZERTY and I'm completly lost on Qwerty, but if I would use it everyday I would quickly get used to it too
I think French is the only language to use AZERTY, and it has many additional letters (à, ç, é, è, ù and `, ¨, ~ and ^ so if we combine them with vowels we can also type â, ä, ã, ê, ë, î, ï, ì, ñ, ô, ö, õ, ò, û, ü and ÿ that we can only type as a lowercase letter)
Sadly œ is missing, even though it exists in only 4 words (sœur, cœur, bœuf, œuf), these are pretty common so it's such a shame
A key for acute accent would be really appreciated too
AZERTY, with a keymap that allow me to do characters like «»ÉÀœŒÇ more easily
The default French Windows layout is a shame
[fr-oss on Windows] for those interested, it's default on Linux
In France the bépo keyboard was created because it's more ergonomic regarding the french language but it's not too popular
Mon conseil : utiliser la disposition [« fr-oss »] qui est pratiquement identique à l'AZERTY de Windows et qui permet de faire plus facilement les majuscules accentuées entre autre
[À récupérér ici sur Windows
AZERTY is evil, I use bépo
It is recognized as an official norm in France, but it's not common
The ¨ letters are still pretty easy to do though, assuming your AZERTY is similar to ours
[« fr-oss » is the way to go
Being able to have accented capitals easily does sound pretty great

" shows pride in being part of the former empire
*Romania* derives from the [Latin] *romanus*, meaning "[citizen of Rome]
&#x200B;
Italy, being the birthplace of the Empire, has the greatest number of buildings and ruins, and takes care of this legacy with the utmost dedication
Not really Roman pride but we commonly to our cultural heritage as « gallo-roman » which is the marriage of Gallic and Roman cultures
Since 1870, the French Republic has been pushing the Gauls as our spiritual ancestors
And before that, it was the Franks
True, it didn't last long though
Funny thing about the Holy Roman Empire, it was neither Roman nor Holy
That's a bit extreme - we are taught that we are a Latin culture, and that our ancestors the Gauls were romanised to become "Gallo-Romans", embracing Roman customs
Except that, under Napoleon, a Roman aesthetic was very visible and the analogy was much more complex (and complete) than just aesthetics, even though Napoléon tried to suppress it when he became Emperor
[La Nation française et l’Antiquité à l’époque napoléonienne ]
>muddy heritage
How so
We tend to view the people who got conquered by Romans as savages (they weren't), because most accounts we have of them come from biased Roman testimonies
The gauls had Runic language but only the Druids knew how to read and write
Despite no other accounts about them than Roman testimonies, we have a few ruins (dolmen), potery, jewelry and many weapons (they used to be mercenaries for the Roman Empire before being conquered)
These people were very fine craftsmen, you can tell by looking at their work in museums
While their civilization wasn't as advanced as the Romans, they had a culture, traditions, their own mythology
It's such a shame we don't know more about them
Same with the Dacians and all the other cultures wiped out by the Romans
Yeah we don't care about that here either
The french legislation consider that a worker on a "contrat à durée indéterminée" (permanent contract) can work without any paper contract (with just a "tacite" contract)
This lead to a few loophole, including the fact that you can force yourself as an employee to a company if :
* you had a temporary contract beforehand (CDD)
* your contract ended
* you still go to work, and nobody tells you nothing
If that happen and that you can prove that you indeed worked and nobody said anything to you in the mean time even though you were out of contract, that means that you ought to have a contract
But since you don't have a paper contract and that the only kind of employement that can be done without any paper contract is the permanent contract, you can bullshit your way out of the french legal system and ending up being employed full time as a permanent worker
Once you're there, you either have a full time job, or you get fired (which means that you will recieve a month of salary as a compensation)
But you'll be remembered as the asshole though
And a company in France have many means way to fire you indirectly (usually, they "force" you to give up your job)
It's not like this anymore
It was probably how it was intended, but I find hard to consider it as anything else but a loophole as it is clearly a shady move from the employee to do
In the same way, the same "loophole" can be applied to insurances and their tacite contract that force you as their customer for the smallest shit you ask them (my mother got scammed once by an insurance that insured her without her knowing it because she asked for a cost estimate of insuring her house)
In France we do not say "I love you", instead we say "je veux bien te laisser le quignon de la baguette", and I think it's beautiful
"tu es fort callipyge" with an eyebrow up
means "nice ass bb"
Can’t help but imagine you as a dwarf from Witcher
brings a tear to my eye
Don’t you ever say nice things to your right hand after sex
bah ce serait con de te priver si ta dulcinée a un bouliche qui flatte la rétine
That’s true as well, my girlfriend recently made a full Witcher 3 play through though so it’s more fresh
You are right, wouldn’t want to make the missus jealous
Coup d'Etat, what else
So our first ever President of the Republic was elected in 1848
As he could not be re-elected, not in the Constitution at the time, [he seized power in 1851 and made himself our Emperor] Him being Napoleon's nephew, he called himself Napoleon III (his cousin who would have been the number II was dead)
His reign lasted till 1870, when he fled to England after driving us to a severe defeat in a war against Prussia, (he got captured,  we lost a significant part of national territory, Alsace and Lorraine)
Killing his own political allies
Yes, Robespierre was
insane, to say the least
Second place is a coup d'Etat while in power, courtesy of Napoleon III
To be honest, despite our history of "constant" revolutions, I can't really think of a politiian that went as far as some in other countries, because, well, usually they would get kicked out before they could try to do anything
You could say Napoléon III maybe, became president then emperor
Mass murder (Reign of Terror)
Um, are you familiar with the Reign of Terror/La Terreur ?
Depends on the accent
French regional accents : they can be prone to friendly teasing, nothing serious
European accents, like Spanish, Italian, English or German : they can also be mocked but also considered cute or interisting
Arab or African accents : It makes the racist jump out of people and is often mocked and ridiculed
It has a generally bad rep associated to it
Overall I’d say foreigner are usually encouraged to get rid of their accent
Here, in France, regional accents are still a common things, especially in rural areas and small towns
However, there is sometimes a kind of discrimination against people with regional accents, especially in big cities such as Paris
Also there is a difference in how accents are seen: for instance, singing-like accents from Southern France are seen as beautiful, while accents from Northern France (Ch’ti) or Alsace, my region, are unfortunately seen as ugly
>Arab or African accents : It makes the racist jump out of people and is often mocked and ridiculed
It has a generally bad rep associated to it
True, usualy people start grouping around clapping hands, the street artists slip on an overall, starts missippi burning sound track, while some guy start carving a cross and an other one search on google map the closest gas station
Don't forget we are civilised, we know our classique
And yes there is cheese, wine and of course baguette
That’s not at all the way they’re seen where I am
We make fun (but not in a bad way) of the accents from Paris, Marseille and Toulouse, sometimes of the accents of the north of France
We say nothing of the accent from Alsace
The others are seen as either nonexistent or variations of the ones I already mentioned
Also, the accents from the south of France are considered heavy/thick here, not singing-like
Or you're teased if your accent is too bad too
The first part is true
In high school, people actually were pointing out my English accent for being "too good". My parents still do that when I speak English
The second part not so much, as a Parisian myself, I’ve never really met anyone hating anyone else for their accent besides the gentle teasing that everyone does
I do feel like the scum of the earth when I talk to people from other regions though
It really be hurting my fragile ego
I can confirm this happens every single day whenever an Arab accent is heard
This is just a daily routine
Just like any language, you can but it does take a lot of work
I’m actually a linguist and I studied that in university
It depends what your native language is and how different it is to French and how much you actively use the language on a daily basis, and the amounts of efforts you put in
That’s merely related, but I met a Dutch person who moved to France in his late 50’s the other day and his accent was impeccable
It can be done
But at the end of the day, accents don’t really matter that much and _in my opinion_ sounding like a native is not worth the enormous amounts of efforts it takes
They also learn the language, but it’s very hard to not have an accent
No matter how good I get at English, I will probably always have some sorts of accent if I don’t put enormous amounts of efforts into it
People with accents are encouraged to get rid a accent with implicit remarks like "Oh you’d be more professional if you got rid of that accent" for exemple
Yes, of course, a lot of people just don’t care
But some does, not a majority though
Here in Alsace, people from other regions either don’t care about our accent or think our accent is ugly
Living in the east, even our own accent was kinda considered ugly, or at the every least funny, for the people that had an heavier accent
Nobody ever said anything about Paris's accent though, to me Paris's accent is the lack of any accent with a mix of talking too fast
Paris definitely has an accent though
It’s seems to you like not but there is one
The area in France with the most neutral accent is Nantes
Maybe we do I don’t know
The only time I’ve heard of a Paris accent was when Le Rire Jaune (another Parisian oops) mocked the Rich Kid️ accent ("Papaaaaa j’ai perdu ma carte goldeuuuh")
But maybe we do have an accent and I have not noticed
And Nantes
I’ve always heard it was Tours
That’s so fun to think about for some reasons
Not at all, I do it as often as I feel like it, nobody cares, wether it's a place I come for the first time or one I'm used to
Not weird at all but boring in my eyes
I'd say it's okay I'm France to eat alone in a restaurant, especially if it's lunch time
But, if it's in the evening, then it could be a bit more weird because the dinner is considered as something done with your family
Maybe it's because in US restaurants are considered a bit fancier than in Europe and when then just want to eat but don't want to cook they go to the macdonald or something fast
While we will still go to a proper restaurant for just eating
Nobody cares
It's completely normal, at least for lunch
Lots of people kinda do their own thing during lunch time, and some people want to unwind
When I'm working for a company that ends the week  at noon on Friday, I like to just eat on a terrace, get a drink and slack for an hour or two
We don't have bounty hunters, that's the job of the law enforcer forces to find people
that is the highest proportion in the world
The Land of the free has the least amount of free people
This looks good, I think I'll try to make some
It sounds a bit like our ["pain surprise"] which is sometimes served for aperitive on nice occasions in France
Yes you are right, there is lots of specialty in all regions
Pizza is well known as italian food but it is not so many eaten in Italy, i would say no more than in the rest of europe or USA
Nowadays there are still fights to defend the Neapolitan pizza (Unesco), and to say that the pizza is initially the Italian product
Unlike pizza which has been very globalized, pasta is A serious thing in Italy imo and foreigners cannot imagine how much it is consumed by Italians and for foreigners who are not used to it, find them on the menu of restaurants every day, there is a culinary shock
I haven't tried it, but the Italian dish that astoned me the most when I heard about it was the Sicilian couscous
It really shows how diverse Italian cuisine is
Wait what, that's a thing
It must be regional, I have never heard of it, and I've lived in Drôme, Bouche du Rhône and IDF
It sounds great though, when is it usually made
It’s often served around end of the year festivities
You can find more than decent frozen ones in your Picard shops
I've seen them often dyring weedings/cocktails/aperitifs ...
Anytime a traiteur is there
I'd rather not try the frozen kind first tbh
Btw, where do you come from
I'm still trying to know where it's eaten
Honestly a bit everywhere I went
I am from north of France and currently living in Rhône and both places have them
Oh even in Rhône ? Funny, my uncle and sister live there and we never ate it
But I'm really intrigued now
Honestly get à Picard one, that’s what people take generally
Making one yourself would force you to cook six or seven different fillings and get a bread of the appropriate shape for a result that may end up being as good as the frozen ones in the end
Some dishes are better to cook yourself, this is honestly not one of those
45 in total:
39 cultural properties, 5 natural properties, and 1 is mixed
Arguably the most interesting (to me, anyway) would be the decorated caves of the Vézère Valley or Chauvet-Pont d’Arc
45, here is the list:
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
My favorite: Mont-Saint-Michel, Carcassonne, Canal du midi, Pont d'arc Cave
Honestly, might not be the taste of everyone, but I think the [Völklingen Ironworks] is one of the most cool
Did you ever visited the reconstitutions of these caves painting ?
I heard they scanned and 3D printed the whole cave, used the same methods to recreate the art and even ajusted the athmosphere so that when entering the museum it would feel just like the real thing (closed to public to prevent damage to the paintings)
Yes I did
And it was just like everything you mentioned
They even added in the fallen rocks that had detached themselves from the walls over the years
It felt completely like the real thing
Never heard of it
I never been but i want to go there sooo much !
The oldest debate in France is about the french name for  "chocolate bread". half of the country says the proper name is "pain au chocolat" where the other half is more in favor of "chocolatine". This is a very serious debate
Problem is particulary acute in summer, when 'pain au chocolat'  supporters are going on vacation in 'chocolatine' supporters land
You could have very problematic discussion about appropriate term for bread with chocolate bar inside in summer
Plus, in food related discussion, if you add wine discussion and how to accomodate perfectly food and wine,
you can say this is our main reason for living
In fact, every discussion in France about food, is more than serious
For example, another great discussion in France is about Cheese and Coffee
Is it appropriate or is it not to put cheese in coffee for breakfast ?
Traditionalists and people from north east are in favor of Coffee with cheese, where modernists tend to think it as a sacrilege from another time
We have another interesting debate about snails
We eat snails in France, just to prove to the rest of the world, that we can eat anything, I guess
Debate is about the taste of the snails
Do we eat snails because of the taste of the snail itself or because of the taste of the garlic butter around the snails ?
It is pretty hard to think that a snail has a taste by itself, but specialists of  "Héliciculture" (snails lovers) tend to think otherway
It's not half and half but more like 90%/10%.
It’s pain au chocolat dammit
In the south west that’s what we say and we have a lot of vacation tourists
Are you talking about the Atlantic coast-south-west
I lived 15 years in Alsace and I never heard anyone use "petit pain"
That’s just another overestimation but the other way lol
The pain au chocolat / chocolatine french [map]
Strictly speaking Quebec population is about 8 millions, a bit less than half french population
And I can just agree, Chocolatine is the right way and Québec has our back
Yes
As shown on the map
It is an atlantic debate not a mediterranean debate
>why not cut Camembert in squares then
Okay, man, you've officially taken it too far
Seriously
It is even [trendy]
Maroilles [cheese] The taste is far better than the smell
It is a cousin of the Munster
I think sürstromming can be acceptable as it's got a nice traditional charm, like everyone has those weird / disgusting dishes that their poor grandparents would enjoy on feast day or something
It's weird but unique
Apple mousse on literally everything, on the other hand, reminds me of the Netherlands in a "grown ups eating like 8 year olds left to make lunch alone".
Indeed, really really too far
If you go in that direction why not putting pineapple on a pizza
That's because Chocolatine karma is stronger than missiles so it makes them scared
we call this a bizutage in french
For France it's ok ... But I'd like to change how German countries call us : Frankreich
It's Frank kingdom and Frank is different than France historically
I'll go with the German and Dutch names, French Empire
I'd replace France with Motherland
M'y country is spelled the same in french ans in English, si it's not really necessary to change it
Frankia is cool tho
Just a closer prononciation to how France is said in french— with a long A. Maybe how some British pronounce France
I wouldn't. It's fine as it is
Never understood what happened with your country name
You call it Deutschland, english-speakers call it Germany, and we call it Allemagne
I wouldn't be surprised to see a 4th completely different name from another language at that point
Edit : ok, found
Saksa in Finnish
Niemcy in Polish
Vacija in Latvian
Did you all just went around Europe giving random names to everyone asking where you are from
Don't forget about Swaziland
Well, calling us Frankreich is no different than us calling them Allemagne
Yeah, that was under Louis XIV not Napoleon and the french word for tie is "cravate"
Reich is "fine", but Franks people were only a part of what became france, it's capital was Aix La Chapelle (Achen) and represented the "nordic" part of France, but more groups of people joined (visigots, Normands, ...) to make the France country
That's right
They were Frank and Charlemagne family were the Franks of I'm not mistaken ... So more french than Germans but still not French as it didn't exist at that time
Think of it like Kurds ... A "nation" sitting accross borders then split between France Belgium and Germany
Where is it and what is it ? Interested !
I love russian names and the nicknames that come with them, Aleksandr/Sasha/Alyosha, Mikail/Misha etc
But it would be strange
Boys: Ladislas, Iskandar (Alexender is good but damn Iskandar sound dopes as fuck)
Girls:Avdotia (even in Russia it's a very old name right
Japanese name "Kakashi". It French it sounds like "caca - chie", literally "poop - is pooping".
I love the name Kirill
What a cool name
I think you could prolly use these names in cities
Too bad, because Russian names are in fact quite popular in France, I know a few French called Dimitri, Boris, Tatiana, Nadège, Yvan, ...
I know where that's from
Or maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure
Means something like "held firmly".
Ah, I wasn't sure actually, thanks for the precision
Do it, the knights tippler
I know a few as well (didn't even know Nadège was russian
), but the nickname/first name combo is what I really love, and that practice isn't coming to France any time soon
Lol, that's what happen when you take a liking of a character from the Russian literature of the 19th century
I immediately think about the red baron, but that's certainly because I am not German
You have a cat, and he likes to sit on your keyboard
With Ericsson, I bet it does !
Wrong
Most people wear clothes with logos on them, be it a jacket, shoes or a bag
I don't if they want me to publicities something, I would want to get paid
For people from outside Europe it's not that difficult
For them Europeans might have more similarities than differences, such as we might see more similarities than differences in different Asian cultures or African cultures
From that point of view, Europeans are pretty similar (general looks, clothing style, food, music, architecture, etc
are generally closer from one European country to another than to African or Asian cultures)
Idk things related to food (no doggie bags, no huge quantities) and even then, there may be European countries that are very generous when serving food
Let's say it's not UNcommon, but it's considered as a pretty pricy and middle-uper class clothing brand in Europe, so you would not see a lot of people wearing Columbia clothes during the day
Switzerland
The bureaucracy , petty rules, the amount of red-tape, the insistence on sharing washing machines / tumble driers and the horrendous housing market made the whole experience less than enjoyable
However, it is still a beautiful, clean, quiet country
Nothing romantic, but 20 years ago going to Denmark I felt it was a great country in advance regarding the wind energy development as a saw multiple fields of wind turbines and was amazed by that view as it was the first time seeing that many
Now I know they rely heavily on German coal / gas electricity and I feel that it’s not as great as it seems
> is how prevalent homeopathy seems to be in pharmacies, like WTF
Do not come to France for your own safety mate
We're the America of Europe in regard of anti-vax/homeopathy/"alternate-sciences"
It's really saddening
Homeopathy is also very much present in France
They are covered by our healthcare
However, since lobbies weren't able to prove its efficiency, it's not going to be the case anymore
A French person complaining is pure immersion
Really ?? Is it because you have an advanced level in French so you're able to talk about politics in class or is it just because your teacher wants to ? I remember learning things like the segregation in the US in English class or the fight against the mafia in Italian class but this wasn't all year, we learn more "basic" things as well
For me it was around 2012 when they all protested to shut down nuclear energy, which is pretty safe and efficient in Europe, and started to re-open  so many coal power plants
I can totally understand your disappointment if your mental image of Paris was based on glamorous films and perfume ads
Unfortunately, that's a very unrealistic view
Paris is a crowded, hectic megacity
For many people, it's a place to work or live in, not an open-air museum
Gare du Nord for exemple is dirty and some louche people hang around but it's also the [busiest] train station in Europe by a large margin
Sadly, many tourists arrive from there and choose a hotel in that neighborhood to be close to the station
In the same way, people often complain about Parisians being rude but most people in massive cities (New York for exemple) are cold and distant
You also have to keep in mind that Paris is the most visited city in the world, so Parisians see A LOT of tourists
In Europe, only London or Moscow have a similar feel in my view
That being said, I don't think that Paris resembles the rest of France
Paris is pretty dirty, for many reasons
I can be safe anytime at night but you need to know your ways around the city
Where were you staying that you found Paris dangerous
I've been going home completely drunk, falling asleep in taxis for years and never once felt unsafe, and it's not like I grew up here, I grew up in the countryside far away from Paris
Same for me
Not sure how recent for you, but for me disappointment started with neo-con era (Thatcher UK and Reagan USA)
At least you can drive on the middle lane without your car shedding bolts
You feel you've entered belgium rather than see it lol
I mean I often stay in the middle lane because the right lane is for trucks and entering the highway and left lane is for speeding
If I'm too slow I'll go to the right lane obviously
Mdr c'est un belge qui dit ça
I thought at the beginning that you were going to criticize cuisine at the beginning and I would have answered that of course cuisine is bad in tourist traps
Turns out it wasn't the case
What do I have to answer to that
Well yes, if a restaurant close we have no information
Yes, it's very difficult and it should change
Although if you go to a restaurant outside of the opening hours that's normal
That was also my opinion on Amsterdam the first two times I visited, but the third time I had a lovely visit of everything where tourists usually don't go and didn't see many drugs and sex stores
Nobody likes Marseille aside from people who grew up there anyway
That can't be the reason, most flats in Paris also have washing machines
Sometimes when it's really small they put a small size machine, but unless you have less than 10 m² you'll have a washing machine
Yes
The norm in France is to have your own washing machine / tumble drier
In smaller flats, they're generally in the kitchen or in the bathroom rather than in the laundry room
The only exception to that rule are very small, very cheap flats in Paris (10m2 flats for exemple), generally located in lower-income neighborhoods, and student halls
It’s true for a lot of people and a lot of cities (the Paris syndrome is well known in Japan)
People are expecting to see only the brightest things they see in ads, films or books
They tend to forget that cities are places to work/live in the first place, not some kind of museum or Skansen
Oh it's completely that
It's the same as when Brits are saying "London's a shit hole and *does not* represent the whole country
It's the same for Paris, except that people's expectations of Paris are even higher than people's expectations of London I'd say
Which is always very saddening because there's so much variety in France
We've got mountains, ocean and see litorals, plains etc
And people generally just go to Paris
>some ***louche*** people
Je t'aime
> the UK are super London centric
Well, erm, France is one of the most capital centred country in the world I'd say
I do understand why people mostly come to Paris even though it's a shame
Everything happens in Paris
Politics, art, sport etc*. France is very, *very* centralised towards its Capital unfortunately
*Not saying there is absolutely *nothing* outside of Paris, but there is way less important national or international thing
I'd say your social policies are bad, when they are not completely inexistant depending on the period
You're really known to be a country where it's best not to be poor*, and Thatcher made sure of that
Moreover I'd also say that even though class struggle/warfare is something every country encounter, it's really at its peak in the UK
*Of course being poor is shitty every where, but it just seems like it's even harden in the UK
You seem like this *really* capitalistic and neoliberal country where everyone will say it's your fault and your fault o my if you're poor
I know it certainly is a cliché, but don't cliché come from some kind of truth
I'd like to have your view on everything I just said, because it's just a foreign point of view, and a lot of things might've changed in the last two decades
Edit: also I'm not OC but I was really interested in the topic and wanted to talk about it
Oh ok
That makes sense, as I'm only B2 in English and B1 in Italian and I'm still in high school lol
Would love to reach the C1 level one day !
> Every RER employee I met tried to help me screw the system so we wouldn't have to pay as much
Man, you missed an opportunity to play the lotterie during your visit
Because damn if that's the most unexpected thing from your comment
Haha, j'adore ce mot dans les deux langues
Do you have an example for that
Usually restaurants open at 19:00 and if it's in a crowded place you'll have two services : 19:00 - 20:30/21:00 and 20:30/21:00 - ~23:00
In tourist spots some restaurants open all day (and even all night in some cities), they might not be great though
I mean if you had turned off the plancha and cleaned it, I'd understand that you wouldn't redo all that work again just for one toasted croissant
Yes I totally understand
Actually a lot of things in small towns like this are often unreliable
Maybe what happened to you is exceptional but it doesn't surprise me
When that happens we just go to another restaurant, if you really wanted to eat here you'll eat here next time, but I understand it is very annoying for tourists, especially in remote places like this
Yep
I agree with you though, that's dumb
I use mine once a week and buying such a machine for 50 uses a year is not really ecological
Hum, might've been during a stricke, that's really uncommon
I think it's just more common in Europe, you can't get anything at any time of the day
It might be cultural
I'd be happy to try to help you with the French surname but I'm not sure what you'd like to know
I don't really understand what you were trying to say about French surnames
What I can tell you is that surnames that are prefixed by "de", meaning "from" - which is NEVER capitalized by the way - are usually associated with the aristocracy, although that is not a hard rule
A lot of names start with D in general because they are compressed forms of "de"  or "du" + something
Other than that I don't really know
> Plus, the French surnames with -eaux etc
I'm not sure what you're asking here but there isn't any logic related to -eaux endings that comes to mind, that's just how those names end
In French, there is no real "son of" particule added to surnames (like could be the *ssen, *son, * ski/ska in other languages)
The "de" particule is more related to places and/or nobility
We have a splendid example among French politicans
Philippe de Villiers full name is actually Philippe Marie Jean Joseph Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon
So his real surname is Le Jolis de Villiers, and is indicative of a nobility title (adding de Villiers to his family name Le Jolis)
The addition of "de Saintignon" comes from his paternal grand-mother Jeanne de Saintignon, another noble French family
Then again, "de" is primarily indicative of a place, but the claim through a family name of a geographical origin is often related to the fact that it is/was the family fiefdom
No resentful at all, but sometimes I wish native english spoken people realize more how lucky and  privileged they are: it's easier to find a job in their country of in foreign countries, your are better paid, easy to travel, others have to make the offert, not you, easier to find more information online, school is easier too because even if foreign languages are teached in those countries, it's ok to fail and it's not that important, it's great but not essential, they have more time/energy to focus on maths, science,  etc etc
Even on Reddit: I'm not fluent in english, so it take me time and more effort to write a comment and sometimes I don't write something I want to say just because it's no difficult or wouldn't worse the effort
And I can't express myself exactly how I want to so sometime people get angry by misanderstanding what I wrote
We will just make sure it doesn't take over ours
The only thing annoying is marketing idiot who abuse of english language
For exemple today, i used glass cleaner and it was not writed "Lave Vitre" but "GlassCleaner"...
It wouldn't be my first choice for a lingua franca (my first choice would have been any language that is not complete bullshit, like Spanish or German, to name a few I'm familiar with), but it's better than not having one at all, for sure
As for how I cope with the cultural hegemony achieved by the *Perfide Albion*, i take solace in the fact that English's got so many french words, it's basically just mispronounced French anyway
actually no ! English is a great language and besides, having a « common » language allow people like us in this sub who are from different countries with different languages to talk together
also English is pretty simple to talk (not perfectly but enough to be understood)
On one hand, it's great that we have a universal language, allowing people to communicate more easily (like on this sub)
On the other hand, it kind of makes it feel like it's useless to learn other languages besides English
Yes
As a *lingua franca*, a universal language, I believe English is not ideal
Although I'm lucky to have learned English by living abroad from a young age, I'm frustrated by the fact that English is a difficult language to learn
As a Frenchman, English is not *that* difficult, because our languages share roots and a lot of vocabulary thanks to our friend William the Conqueror
And yet we could choose a universal language that would be much easier to learn for everyone, allowing for potentially billions of hours and dollars saved
This could either be an existing language or a constructed language, like Toki Pona
Yes that's an annoying *scenario*.
The curse of this language
Easy to start with
hard as hell to master
I don't really pity them, there is worse in life than only knowing one language
But I find that even if most of them knows it's great to speak english to travel most of them don't realize how difficult it can be for many people to learn a new language not because you wants to but because you are forced to if you want to succeed
Most english native speakers don't use a second language, some need it for their job but it's not the norm
Here for many job, not all of them but many, speaking english is needed
I rarelly see american/australia/brits etc
speaking french, most of them just remember a few words from school, but those who learnt it properly are generally very good at it
>When it comes to jobs, native English speaking people only get an edge if it's really related to the language (translation, transcription, etc), otherwise they're hardly any better off compared to someone who speaks English fluently but not natively
Same for traveling or finding information online
That's the point, the english speaking person didn't have to make the effort to effort to learn a language to find a job and had more time to learn an other skill instead
I had to learnt english for work and I don't work for a translation job
That's the point, he the ukrainian guy had to learn english to find a job in Norway, while a british for exemple wouldn't have to learn it to get that job
The ukrainian guy had to work harder in a way
Germany: been there, done that
Multiple time
Now both countries are like a couple, which mean we care for each other but are always arguing on small things
Switzerland: not really a topic
I've heard a lot of Swiss come to France for health issues since their hybrid public/private healthcare is very costly
Some French are working over the border since the wages are way better
Italy: culturally close so everything is fine
We have a shared interest into food, fashion, and public deficit
Also we are both latin countries
Spain: not really a topic except the whole Catalogne thing
There is a lot of regionalism in France, so the government really dislike the idea of an European region trying to get its independence
It may give bad ideas to Bretagne or Alsace, you see
UK: their food is awful, the Brexit is stupid, they have a monarch while everything is obviously fine without one
We always have something to criticize about them because, in fact, we really do love these bastards
Belgium: you mean the soon-to-be new Hauts-de-France ? Nah I'm just kidding
We are pretty close culturally because the South Belgium speaks French
We don't really care about North Belgium because they do not speak French
Also their accent is funny and our jokes about them are terribles
Luxembourg: a very few people know about this country except from a fiscal point of view, except in the east of the country
A lot of students from Luxembourg are studying in the east (Nancy, Metz, Strasbourg) while a lot of French are working in Luxembourg (mainly living around Metz and Thionville)
The Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFIP, taxpayer's nightmare) hate them, still
Belgium  - This is probably our neighbours with whom we have the most links
The French part loves us and we love them too, some even like to consider it as a French region
Many people spend a day or a weekend there and many artists are extremely well known in France
It's not surprising to find Belgians who have come to live in the north of France
Germany  - I know that we have fought 3 wars in 100 years, 2 of which were among the deadliest in history, but today there is no longer any direct tension between our countries
A lot of French people close to the border will spend a day or a weekend in Germany sometimes
But there are still a lot of people who don't like Germany because they see the country as the "leader" of the European Union and want a system based more on a Europe of nations (it comes from De Gaulle)
Switzerland  - We only know the part of Switzerland that speaks French and we like them a lot, we don't know too much about the rest
It doesn't look like it, but a lot of famous French people were born in Switzerland like Jean-Paul Marat, Rousseau or Napoleon III, so our stories are really interconnected
Italy  - I say this because I live less than 100km from the border but I think they are our favourite neighbours
We have a fascination for the Italians, their culture, their gastronomy that we see as almost on a par with our own
We love to go there and spend a few days in Turin, Genoa or Milan
Monaco  - It's a city-state where most people speak French
The people who go there are either because they are millionaires or because they want to look at the beautiful cars while walking along the beach
Spain  - We don't speak much about Spanish people in France (the last time we talked about it was with the history of Catalonia)
Nice people that many people see as a poorer country than us, so cheaper and go there mostly to buy cheap products and resell them in France
It's quite sad, but we still enjoy the landscape and the climate when we go there
Andorra  - I've never heard anyone talk about it, not many people go there
I don't know much about them, they must be nice I guess
EU FTW
As long as we're a thing, most of us don't have to worry about warring between ourselves, and it's a powerful enough defensive pact  to dissuade any neighbourg \*cough\*Russia\*cough\*. Stronger than NATO actually
It's really sad how much Italians seem to hate us
It's always the consensus during those questions and we actually like Italy and Italians so it's always kind of heartbreaking and I just don't get it
German food is quite good but it always bugs me when I take the ICE from Paris to Strasbourg, you people are opening tin can beers at 17 ? And eating at 18 ??? Also there is no separation in your train so there is food smells everywhere past 18
It's disturbing because at 18 I maybe had a sweet snack one hour ago and I'm not expecting to eat before 20
Best friends except North-Belgium did their best to cut off most of the federal funding in favor of regional funding for public services
But our government's choices are our own and don't impact you, and honestly Italians hating on us because of politics is irony of the highest level
Calm down V
I'm French
I had friends living in Liège and they were pretty salty about it a few years ago when the law was about to be adopted
Since the North is wealthier than the South, regional funding of public services mean less funds in Wallonie
Actually I'm pretty jealous about the weather
I'm working in Paris and I had this colleague during a few months working remotely from Firenze
Our daily meetings with webcam on were very painful, he was drinking his coffee in front of his co working place, sunbathing, while I just came out of 30 minutes of crowded subway and it rained the whole week
I'm thinking about moving in another country in a few years, and Italy is in my top 3 actually
I see, from your examples I only know of Gaddafi but barely because I was too young at the time (I think it was 10 years ago
) but I understand how that can be an issue
Great to know, I never visited the area of Bologna
I already visited Genova, Roma, Pisa, Milano and Isola d'Elba, and I keep great memories from these places
I'm not planning to move by necessity, I just aspire to see new things !
In Alsace some people speak Alsatian, a germanic dialect very close to german with borrowed french words
The language is dying thought, it is still spoken in villages by old people but in Strasbourg (main city in Alsace) you will hardly hear Alsatian
Everyone speaks french or german
I know a little bit of Alsacien, native to the region of Alsace on the German border, it's a dialect of German with some French elements and it's dying out, like most regional dialects in metropolitan France
In under a century, Alsacien went from being the region's inhabitants' native language to being very rarely spoken by anyone under 40
Today, the elderly natives always speak it natively, my parents' generation often learned it alongside French but then didn't pass it on to their children
I make active efforts to learn some of it, but I have no doubt that in a generation or two it'll be almost if not entirely dead
I won't go into the history of why this is the case because this comment is already long enough, but this is common to most dialects in metropolitan France and Alsacien is one of the few dialects that's still relatively alive
In France there's almost a specific language for envry region but it's very likely to French
I think the most popular and spoken language is the "breton"
In the "drom com" (the French isles) they almost all speak "creole" it's a mix beetwen French and old African
Is it close to Corsican
À Strasbourg on entend de l'alsacien de temps en temps, et pas de mal de monde cale quelques mots alsaciens du genre un schlouks
Mais c'est vrai que le dialect se perd
I come from the area of Mulhouse (South Alsace) and I speak alsatian, my grand-parents taught me how to speak it and always prefered speaking Alsatian than French
It also helped a lot to be fluent in German
Nowadays Alsatian is regaining its popularity amongst the younger generation (mainly in rural areas)
There isn't a single creole, most ex French colonies have their own creole which take elements from French, whatever the local language was before colonization, and any other languages brought by their speakers
\> That's like taking a Bavarian dialect and calling it its own language
No, it's like taking an germanic dialect and calling it a dialect
I can't speak german or alsatian but apparently even though alsatian is pretty close to german, it's not 100% similar, it forms some sort of dialectal continuum accross the french/germany/switzerland border but the further you go in Germany the less you will understand the german they speak
That's why some school offer both Alsatian AND German classes
Everybody just called it "German" before the French-Prussian war
Ca fait que deux ans que je vis à Stras mais je n'ai jamais entendu quelqu'un dire "schlouks" lol, ca veut dire quoi ?
For a long time, the French were big fans of centralization, they wanted everything to be centralized in France
This includes the language, everyone needs to be speaking the same language, and a common language encourages nationalism and reduces the risk of creating a real will for independence
So for the last few centuries (especially after WW1 when France got Alsace-Moselle back) it has been a big issue to make it so alsaciens felt right at home in France, despite being culturally closer to the German neighbors
The consequence of this is that regional dialects are kind of seen as ugly weird languages only lower class people speak, while when you're educated, you speak good French
This connotation led our grandparents not to encourage Alsacien speaking without forbidding it (like in school at one point) and then our parents would prefer French, because they probably spoke it better too
The French government had a big part to play in the erasing of Alsacien language, as well as that of many regional dialect, and consequently, culture
En plus les dialectes n'existe pas vraiment, c'est juste un terme politique pour dénigrer la valeur des autres langues de la même famille
Une gorgée. C'est utilisé dans toute l'Alsace
Y a même une application sur Strasboirg "Schlouk map" qui indique tout les bars de la ville :)
That strikes don't work anymore and haven't in a while
Some countries are doing some wine with a quality that can definitely outcompete ours
We're a minor country and our system isn't going well
Our country isn't doing as bad as people like to think
Sure, we're not the superpower we once were but if you talk to some French you would think we are a third-rate country
For god's sake, we're in the top 10 if not 5 of almost everything
Economy, Army, Diplomaty, Food Quality even our National Railroad thé SNCF isn't as bad as people like to say
85% rate in ponctuality ? Yeah Say that to a French and he will laugh
>That we are not as great, as powerful, as respected and admired as we once were
This is pretty weird to me has I don't think France ever was that much great/respected or admired
To me France never realy gave a fuck on how she was perceived and was diplomaticaly very pragmatic
Fought protestant with in her country while defending them outside of it, same with muslim/Ottoman
I mean historicaly, France was never realy that much above the rest of europe and kept fighting for her survival against on one side the English on the other the Hasburg and the rare times she wasn't at war with her neighbours she was fighting herself
I don't feal like in France you have that kind of English misplaced pride to believe that we "owned" half of the world, or like we conquered Europe, or we created the USA, etc
French usualy don't realy feal concerned nor invest in those historical event
Mostly because of the numerous regime that we had and that no one claims the paternity of our history in a whole since it mostly got there by over throwing the precedent
I think that most of the "arrogant french" cliché come from the fact that french just don't admit that anyone or anything is above them by essence, but that is well rooted in our culture
I mean we killed monarchie, killed god and we are still around
The US/Russia don't realy impress us, like India/China
I mean it's not because English and it's culture has taken over the world, that we should capitulate to it if we don't agree, nor do we think this might not change like our history has tought us
EDIT: Just to make things clear, I clearly don't believe that France is heaven on earth but to me right now, the hard to swallow pill would be more to get rid of all the boomer mess and delirium they made
Like retirement, get of stalinist syndicat, schizophrénic left that shit on colonialism but still wants to live on high standard that it allowed, corrupted liberals and of course the politicaly impaired like FN and FI
Tbh yes France isn’t as great as it once was but it honestly isn’t as bad as a lot of people think (yes France is a major power and diplomatically/culturally the nation is one of the most important in the world)
Yeah, tell me about it
Well, if you Can talk to your neighbors about not going to my country to put your trash on the side of the road, it would be a start
Too much strike kills the power of strike
It's time for strikes and protests to be used by the working class for real social issues, as they were originally meant to be, and not any more for whining about first world problems
To me, it's the exact opposite
We're doing far better than most frenchs like to say
But you're proving my point i guess
I was really really impressed when I went to Chile, wasn't expecting the wine there to be that good tbh
It's in French, but i dont have a better one
10 tons each year
It's in French, but i dont have a better one
10 tons each year
That's protecting World heritage
Not that shitty of a thing
Then take it, stop wasting time
I feel like I know quite a bit, and I feel closer to you guys than to many European countries
Though I've never been to any North African country, I know plenty of people with familial ties there, some of whom do go there relatively often
I guess you know about France already
I’d just like to point out the topics students in prepa lettres study this year in history: "France & Africa (1830-1962)" plus "Rome & Carthage (5th-1st centuries before Christ)”. So it’s not only about the Maghreb, but it’s included
The dates are actually more complex than that for the second but yeah, the spirit is what’s important: a large part of future history teachers in France will be people who spent a year studying these two topics
I feel like we’re
moving on
I’m glad I studying colonization in depth for once
I would believe the most knowledgeable would be the Spanish, the French, and maybe the Italians
I’m a French Sephardic Jew so I feel well connected
The Maghreb has been home to Jewish people for millennia and many of us still have family there
For French Sephardim, even if we’ve been in France our whole lives and our parents’ lives, our culture is still a good mix of cultural practices, foods, languages, music, etc
I’ve been to Morocco before and I’d like to go back
I’m especially interested in Algerian Jewish culture, a lot of my community have Algerian heritage
Unfortunately Algeria has recently been (and maybe still is) one of the most dangerously antisemitic places in the world, so Jewish life has been all but extinguished
maybe not an ideal holiday destination at the moment
One day, though
Algeria has actually always had really strong ties with Russia, since the independence !
I am not
The French resistance during WWII would work really well
La Révolution
it would be interesting to say the least
Really
I need to check out
beaufs
Cul terreux
Muddy ass
[Damn right]
Kéké works as well
&#x200B;
But yeah Beaufs is defintively the main word
From the french swiss perspective, german swiss (bourbines) are the chavs there
already knew what it was even before clicking
When I think of kéké all I can picture is Franck Dubosc
[good times]
Ou encore des ploucs
We also have "prolo" which comes from "prolétaire" (same meaning as Proletarier I believe) but that means poor here
Les ploucs c'est les beaufs de la campagne, c'est les Kékés des prés quoi
Aren't hobos closer to racaille than chavs
Wallah en France aussi
Spanish: Easiest to understand, especially written
If they speak slow enough it's possible to understand what they say
Italian: Kinda the same as for Spanish, it's quite okay as long as they speak slowly, you can kinda know what they're talking about but you don't understand everything
Catalán: Weird mix between French and Spanish, but it's impossible to understand to me, at least when spoken
Portuguese: Can grasp a few things here and there when written, but can't understand anything when spoken
Romanian : Maybe will understand a few words and there in writing but that's all
Nothing when spoken
Italian and Spanish are very close languages from french so it's very easy to understand without learning any words
Now that I learned english, I am able to understand few words in danish an japanese because this language has many words inspired from english words (ex : butter/batâ ; pocket/poketto)
Italian: I can understand it relatively well when spoken or written, but I cannot speak it
I can grasp what a conversation is about
Spanish: I can understand it well when written, but oh God people speak so quickly
I cannot understand a spoken conversation because of the speed
Portuguese: Sometimes I understand a word or two when written, but more generally no I can't understand it
Romanian: no
Italian : I get the general sense but couldn't compose a sentence
Portuguese : same
Spanish : same
Canadian french : we get all of it but some words have different meanings, usually slang, so it can get confusing
Romanian : I get nothing orally but some words ring a bell (probably because I took latin in school)
In French a lot of the words resemble Italian like « promotion » is « promozione » or « écharpe » (scarf in French) is « scarpa »
Also almost all the words ending with TION sound the same if not spelled exactly the same way
Exemple:
Intervention
Promotion
Legalisation
Motion
Juxtaposition
I understand 80% of written spanish because virtually all the words sound similar to french or have a common root with french words, but spoken spanish is really hard to understand especially spanish from spain
Spanish from Argentina or Mexico sounds easier because they speak slower and articulate more
But overall, written spanish is easier to understand than spoken spanish
Italian is even easier, it's like a wierd cousin of French tbh
If you really focus you can understand half of what they say
Written is even easier, like 90% of it is understandable
For example i take a random sentence from  the homepage of wikipedia italy:
"Nella tecnica delle ferrovie si definisce tender un veicolo destinato a trasportare il combustibile e l'acqua necessari per il funzionamento di una locomotiva a vapore
Without looking anything up, here is how i can translate it to french in my head :
"En technique ferroviaire se définit "tender" (i don't know what that is) comme un véhicule destiné à transporter le combustible et l'eau nécessaire pour le fonctionnement d'une locomotive à vapeur"
See, only one word that i couldn't figure out
Spanish is more or less the same :
"El parque nacional de la Sierra de Guadarrama es un área protegida de las provincias españolas de Madrid y Segovia
En 2015, con 2 989 556 visitantes, fue el segundo parque nacional más visitado de España, tras el parque nacional del Teide (Tenerife)
How i undestand it : "Le parc national de la Sierra de Guadarrama est une aire protégée de la province espagnole de Madrid et Segovia
En 2015, avec 2989556 visiteurs, elle fut le deuxième parc national le plus visité d'Espagne, après le parc national del Teide (Tenerife)".
You can see the similarities yourself
Again though, spanish people speak super fast and it sounds like they don't articulate much so when they speak it's really hard
I don't know much about Portuguese though, but from what i've seen it's very close to Spanish
I'd say i can make out 50-60% of it (written)
Romanian is definitely harder, i can make out maybe 40% of it (written) ?
Never heard it so I couldn't say
Hey you're talking about guillotines and all, so I'm gonna go slightly offtopic and talk about torture
During the Algeria war, we used the *gégènes*, which are affectuous nicknames for *generators*. You get it, they were radio generators that were used to
cook the unwilling soldier
Typically, you put one electrode on the ear and the other on the genitals
It was so effective we even inspired Pinochet with it !
... The guillotine
You almost made me spit my coffee
That's like
a bit excessive
even to my taste
That's imaginative at least
Well we aren't known for our good mastery of foreign languages
Pretty common in France; you can find it for regional languages starting in kindergarten, and for foreign languages it's an option in most high schools (usually English or German, sometimes Spanish or Italian)
It's very rare and there are very few highschools that have this kind of classes and a bit more universities
Nagyon jol hangzik :D
He means teaching non-language-related courses in a foreign language
It's not very common in France, but it does exist
There is for instance the [C.I.V.] close to me
They teach some courses in either English, Chinese, Italian, ...  And it's a state school, so basically free
I know what they mean otherwise I wouldn't have said it was an option
Not in metropolitan France anymore, most separatists movements turned into sorts of political search for more regional representation (like teaching local dialects in schools, funding for regional cultural affairs and stuff)
However, Corsica has an independence party currently ruling, and some of our ultramarine (= overseas) territories are actively seeking independence (New Caledonia has a referendum pending i think)
France doesn't know what you mean
*Sweats in català*
Scania is no joke
Scania needs to be Danish to restore the balance in the force
There are some separatist movements, but none are really big or serious
It's partly due to the consistent effort, over the last 150 years, to remove all cultural singularities in metropolitan France
Nonetheless, these cultural singularities are coming back and here to stay, probably not as independentist movements but probably more as decentralization/autonomization movements
About New Caledonia : the Nouméa Agreements set 3 referendums which question is : "Do you want New Caledonia to access full sovereignty and become independant ?".
One was held in 1987, one in 2018, and one will be held on the 06/09/2020 (DD/MM/YYYY for our american fellows)
In 1987, the independentists were boycotting the vote, which led to the "No" winning with 97,8% of votes
In 2018, "No" won with 56,8%.
I doubt the "Yes" will win in 2020, but the margin is thin enough that there cannot be any certitude
From the french swiss, i just hear them saying that the german swiss are dumb and racist
But i think that's just the "city VS rural area" thing, and not the communities
? Ce n'est pas un problème pour nous
They want both independence and more money from gov
Yeah, i have never heard a corsican said that he want to join Italy, it's rather independance (few), more autonomy (that's what they are going to have), or just stay like they are
But, the thing, that they will all (or nearly that) take back into the discussion is the short corsican republic that have been invaded by France
Sweden
Denmark
Norway
Finland
Long ago, the four nations lived in harmony
But this changed when Sweden attacked
You wish
In french we have the same word for both father-in-law and stepfather which is "beau-père". Same with mother-in-law and stepmother (which is "belle-mère"), but there are two different words for sister/brother-in-law ("belle-sœur/beau-frère") and stepsister/brother ("demi-sœur/frère"), it can be a little bit confusing
“Serviette” means both napkin and towel in French
Beaux parents both means in laws and step parents in French
Got me a few times that one
Same in French, with use corbeau for both
Same in French, both ravens and crows are just *corbeaux*.
Mmmh
So what about [Corneille] and [Corbeau] then
Not the same separation I think
Crow and Raven both are Corbeau, and I think Corneille is different
ault for example
I just clicked the "change language" feature on wikipedia on [Crow] and [Raven] respectively, so I think the distinction is actually the same in both languages
Oh well
We still have the chouette/hibou for the English Owl
French more than anything, tbh I've moved around so much that it'd be hard to identify with one region specifically
From Ile-de-France, just nearby Paris, I'm used to be considered Parisian, but I'd say it comes third after French and European
I identify myself as french then lorraine/vosgienne then as western european
I'm French and Lorrain
Both have relatively equal places in my heart
Yes especially Quebec and Wallonia
\- building tree houses
\- bike
\- playing in the river/forest/dirt

Focus (likewhen french people like me pronounce it, it sound like f\*ck us)
and throughout, it doesn't sound consistent, more like someone chocking on food
Also the difference between though and saw it tiny to my ears
Same with war/wore/were/whore etc
Squirrel
The word designed to torture students whatever the language
Écureuil, Eichhörnchen, squirrel
Room
Return, and of course The Rural Juror (are there 30 Rock fans here
Basically anything that starts with an r. The English r is just a nightmare, I either do a straight-up French r which sounds, well, very French, or something closer to a w, which sounds ok when it's inside a word, but awful at the start
I have to force myself to pronounce properly the "th" sound
Flour, I cannot figure out where to place it in the spectrum between floor and flower
Mostly I can't get the rhythm right (am French, dunno if my flair is active) and I am very inefficient and lose breath pretty quickly as I overcorrect my pronunciation with it/hit/eat/heat ship/chip/sheep/cheap
Squirrel - I just can't, years after years
Funny thing, it's also quite hard for English speaking people to pronounce the French translation - écureuil
Not only hard to pronounce but also I never remember how to write "neighborhood"
I am completely incapable of pronouncing the name of the town Fort Lauderdale, which is pretty awkward as I go there around 3 times per year
That's because it's a French word and the English pronunciation is trying to follow the French pronunciation but not quite
See also: oeuvre
Don't worry with the french R, foreign french teacher love to make a big deal of it and calling it "the french R" but actually we have different one: rolled R, german R, a R that sound like the spanish J but softer etc
we use everyone according to our regional accent, if we speak fast or not, if it's easier to pronounce, if we want to accentuate on a word etc etc
so just do the one you can do and it's fine
Well yes I can hear a difference between on and un/on/en, those sounds completely different to me, but not really between un and in for example
I know how to pronounce though and saw but the difference is tiny to my ears: if you pronounce them apart and you articulate well I obviously hear the difference, but in a sentence or if I don't really pay attention or the person just speak fast the difference can be harder to hear
Okay thanks ! Now how do i pronounce wheat ? Like in sweet ? You know, so i can make the distinction between a janitor and a baker (wet floor / wheat flour)
[Is it schedule or schedule
I don't know enough about german (i learnt english, spanish and chinese ) to tell
About the difference between en and other it's tricky: en in "bien" sound like "in" in "calin". But en in "content" sound like "an" in "maman". So there is (for us) a big difference between an/in/on but en can be like an or in depending of context
Also in and un are supposed to sound different but in modern french we pronounce it the same
To me an in maman, on in mouton and in in calin sound as different that O with A and I in the alphabet
Foreigners also have trouble to make a difference between é and è but to us it's pretty obvious
But it's ok if you can't make a difference because in the region é and è sounds in words are reverse
For exemple: Lait (milk): I pronounce it lè while my friends from the north say lé like in les
I think it have a lot to do with the culture and the beer culture
In Germany, beer is not a drink to get drunk but a drink
In UK, it's more about getting drunk
I have only been to the UK a few times, but from what I have noticed one of the main differences is the curfew in the UK
Because of the curfew, people in the UK tend to rush to the pub directly after work and get drunk as fast as they can, as the pub will close at one point
In Germany there's no curfew, so in my experience people tend to first go home after work, eat dinner and then meet up in a bar much later
There's no pressure to get drunk as fast as possible as many bars close very late or do not even close at all before sunrise
So people might drink as many beers or maybe even more in one night, but not as fast
As a student in Germany it was quite usual to meet up with friends in a bar at 21:00 or even 22:00 in the night and drink beer for hours, you'll drink a lot, sometimes more then 10 large beers (0,5L) but you'll stay only tipsy or slightly drunk for hours, without ever getting shitfaced
Also, typical German beers are quite low on alcohol levels, 4,5-5° maybe, in the UK other types of beer with higher alcohol content might also be popular
Canada feels both familiar and foreign at the same time
It is hard to say for France
Maybe the UK because of history
Or Poland or Ireland because of the independence and catholic spirit
Romania for the love of culture
Or Russia because of the Revolution and the feeling of being unique and universal
But at the end of the day, only Rome worth Paris, and only Paris worth Rome
Not similar at all but I’d say this mutual obsession you mentioned would actually be between France and Japan rather than Finland
Northern England and the North of France feels very very similar because of the working class culture/coal mines
Even the architecture (red bricks working class housing)
Yeah it's a bit uncanny
In francophone places, you'd think we're the same because of the language but then the north american culture hits you right in the face
> the more powerful neighbor
Damn Belgians
I dont think you understood the question
How are the UK, Ireland and Rome far from France
The Japanese government since Meiji restoration is actually based largely on the German Empire’s government and legal system
The Japanese legal system is greatly inspired and draws heavily from German civil law to this day
Source:
The distance is more cultural here: the Anglo Saxon world vs the Latin world
definitely not far away though, even culturally
I wasn't that disoriented when I lived in England compared to most other countries
The landscape itself is not unique at all but [you can see England] from the Côte d’Opale (North of France) on sunny days
Probably the [Wild Coast of Quiberon] which is still a fair drive away
Brocéliande forest is also pretty nice
I can think of a few incredible landscapes:
\- Le [Mont St Michel]
\- La [Dune du Pilat]
\- Les [Ocres de Rustrel]
\- La [Mer] de [Glace]  ("ice sea) in Chamonix
\- Les Falaises d'[Étretat]
\- Les [Orgues de l'Ille sur Tet]
\- Les [Calanques] de Cassis
Les Ocres de Roussillon, aka Little Colorado

Oh wow, this looks incredible
Haha same ! So we may have *met* from accross the channel by chance one day !
Computer science in France, we use Discord for almost every class except for English where we use MS Team
High school here, we use blackboards (bbcollab) for all lessons done online
I have like one online class every 3 days and then they sometimes give us busy busywork
We use Zoom and BB collab
Mine are mostly using Discord or a bad app from the university
In France we have Arnac-la-Poste, which (at least phonetically) means "Fraud-the Post"
**Montcuq** *-> Mon cul -> My ass*
It is the most known but there is plenty
"Montcuq" in France which sounds like "mon cul": my ass
Ahh in France we have the very famous Montcuq, which when pronounced means “my ass”
Not for from where I am there’s Gland (knob) then Pussy not too far either
There is a town called Rohan in France
We have the very famous Montcuq village that sounds like "mon cul" (my ass in French)
It's really known in France and there are many jokes about it
Le Fion (the ass)
Poil (hair)
Montcuq (sound like Mon cul, my ass)
Glandage (doing nothing)
Condom (do I need to explain that one)
And many many other funny villages
Not to mention Villejuif, a Paris suburb, meaning "The Jewish town"
We also have Bitche in Moselle (and the communauté de communes is called Pays de Bitche too apparently)
Let's mention Fourqueux (sound like French for "pitting dick in")
Bitche, Anus, Chatte (Pussy), Condom, Gland (Glans), La Trique (the hard on) , Le Cercueil (the coffin), Mouais ("meh"), Trécon (very stupid)
Since Brest doesn't sound like anything particular in French, I never realized until today that it did in fact sound like "breast
" Thanks
Bourg-la-reine, phonetically sounds like "fuck the queen"
Bouffémont ... Sounding like eat my ...
Brest-Litosvk right
Does trusting the Germans to not try and take over Europe as "ignoring simple safety rules" ? Because if so the policy of appeasement
There's also the [Courrières mine disaster] in 1906, a thousand people died (including children)
It was either caused by badly handled mining explosives or by the use of naked flames lamp because engineers underestimated the presence of methane in the mines
I'm atheist but I go to the Mass at funerals because it's important for the dead's family
I am full atheist, so personally, no
I have experienced death in my close family, and to me this is just the end of life
I still have these persons in my heart and mind of course and I wish they were still here, but that's life, we are born, we live and then we die
From my experience, people prefer to keep it safe when they are dealing with non-religious grievers
They would say comforting things like "She was a wonderful aunt, I will never forget her", or even fringing on spiritual like "I feel like he is still here with me", but claiming to an atheist widow that you know how many years her husband is going to spend in purgatory is rude
(Some still do though, you have cads everywhere)
You are talking about anti-theism, not atheism
Atheism is "not believing in god", not "believing in the absence of god"
They are generally exited and first question is "How it is to live in Pariiiiiis
it's my dream".
And I answear " I don't live in Paris and it would be a nightmare to me".
"Wow, really
Are you from Paris
" which will annoy every French person that isn't from Paris
"Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir" is the most common reaction I got when I was in Germany
Also, some people called me 'baguette' for a while
We have the same
France ? Hun hun hun la baguette
American/British/French schools in the Middle East teach history as it is taught in other Western countries
With that being said, you always have idiots who think Hitler is “good” because of what he did to the jews
They obviously did not know that the middle east would be his next destination if Russia would fall
Not to mention that they are also semitic people sooo
yeah
Ugh the obsession with skin color
Oh and they also often said "Nique la police" , which means fuck the police
Is there any German here that could explain me why you all know that
The countryside is cool indeed, but beware of Gégé in the woods
The food is as great as they say
Québécois are cool to me, I would like to visit, but most French know shit about Québec except the accent
We support them in their independence journey
Vive le Québec libre !
Of course I can
Just as I can say "America is a first world country".
1 millions people live in the city of Paris, and about 12
5 millions in its urban area
As of 2018, there are 67 millions French people
I have to agree that ~1/6 of the population is a lot, so it's understandable that foreigners will ask the question, even more when knowing the appeal and attractiveness Paris has
While Paris is without a doubt the most populated city, and has the most populated urban area as well (Marseille is the 2nd city with 863 310 inhabitants and has the 3rd most populated urban area with 1
5 million), most provinciaux (people who don't live in Paris) don't like Parisians
The fact that there's a word referring to everyone who's not Parisians can help explain that lol
Also most French people don't really like the capital all that much (everything can be really expensive especially housing, way too many tourists everywhere, feels crowded, Parisians live here)
But to be more serious here, it's mostly annoying because France is much more diverse than Paris
Depending on the person, regional identities can be very strong, some parts with even their own language (Britanny, Corsica, Pays-Basque) and accents (south of France, Alsace)
Don’t mess with Gégé, or Didier for that matter
Yes, indeed
The expanding territory, the many fronts and all the air, ground and maritime transportation/operation required more oil
He was advised to attack South to secure oil before heading into Russia
But, Russia was always his first ambition
Initially he did not expect France and UK to react and wanted to go West
Nope, nothing at all, unfortunately
I live in the Auvergne region of France
We had about 10-14 cm of snow on 14 November but since then nothing
Multiple forecasts of snow but nothing
In fact we have only had about three icy mornings
I live in the Northeast of France, and so far it hasn’t snowed
The temperatures were very mild until about 3 days ago when they got below freezing during the night mainly
And the area is known for harsh winters
This is terrifying
In France, I'd trust them to not be frauds and actually send the products
I would not necessarily trust the quality of their products though
Only very gullible old people would buy something from them imo
[This picture] of Charles De Gaulle in Paris after the liberation in August 1944

I would love to live in Vatican
Seems lit
I really love Greek and Arabic !
I love Romanian and Russian
Italian and Icelandic
Turkish for me
Italian and german
Arabic and Japanese
I also like the way both of these languages are written, it's very elegant to me
Why French
Why
Met a student from Romania at uni a few weeks ago, right before this whole corona quarantine bullshit
She happened to have received a call from her family back home while we were having a.... erm
constructive discussion
and damn if romanian isn't a sexy language, I don't know what is
sounded a bit familiar (it's a romance language after all) but particularly distinct and exotic as well
But hey
finding her incredibly attractive might be playing a part, I don't know lol
Damn right but still in touch so it's ok haha
She returned to Romania for the time being
Has your country ever been ruled (outside periods of occupation by another country) by someone foreign-born
For example, the current Georgian President was born French (with Georgian origins) and was naturalized Georgian in 2004
In France, we had chief ministers of state (unofficial prime minister) who were born abroad (Cardinal Mazarin, for example, was Italian) but their power was limited, due to the absolute monarchy
Manuel Valls was naturalized French when he was 20 and was our prime minister from 2014 to 2016
Edit: by foreign-born I meant borned foreigners, not citizen of your country
I'm sorry I wasn't very clear
I mean, you didn't name the most obvious one for France which was Henri IV, one of our most famous kings
He was from Navarre and he was a protestant, and had to convert to catholicism to access to the throne, leading to a famous bon mot: "Paris vaut bien une messe" (Paris is well worth a mass)
To add to the OP, we also have a number of French citizens born abroad who ruled France: Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, former president who died recently, was born in Coblenz in Germany
Paul Deschanel, a IIIrd Republic President, was born in Belgium
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was born in Izmir in Turkey
Also, we've had a number of recent candidates for the Presidential Election born abroad: Eva Joly (ecologist) is Norwegian, Jean-Luc Mélenchon (radical left) was born in Tangiers, today in Morocco and then an International Zone, and Jacques Cheminade (small candidate, kinda loony) was born in Buenos Aires and has dual French-Argentinian citizenship
Henry IV of France was born in the Kingdom of Navarre and crown King Henry III of Navarre first
He acquired the French crown as a direct descendant of Louis IX
As a near miss : Napoléon is born three months after Corsica was annexed
Back then it was an independant republic for 14-15ish years and before it was part of the Republic of Genoa
We tried to import Queen from Austria and we didn’t like that
What is wrong with you, Austria
José I was born in the Corsican Republic
(Ok it was annexed by France when he was 1 year old but it technically counts)
I was about to write about Bernadotte
Quite an interesting story to read about
>	Felipe V duke of Anjou was indeed French
And now, Louis, Duke of Anjou, is Spanish and pretender to the throne of France as Louis XX
I always forget why the King of Spain and the legitimate pretender to the crown of France are not the same, but I suppose it has something to do with Salic law and Franco's intervention
VGE, Deschanel and Balladur weren't born foreigners
Henry IV was
Aren't the Seljuks a foreign dynasty to begin with ? They don't come from Anatolia, do they ? (Manzikert wouldn't make much sense if they were i guess ?)
And before the Seljuks wasn't it the Byzantine Empire ? Constantin I was born in modern Serbia, and I would bet a bunch of other emperors were not locals (at least I would expect the first ones to be roman aristocrats)
If by "fun" you mean "incorrect", sure
Granted, Corsica had been French for all of three months when Napoléon was born, but still
Napoléon was born a few months after the annexation of Corsica
I wasn't talking about born foreigner, just born abroad
French legitimists think treaty of Utrecht is not valid
Juan Carlos is 5th in the succession order for them
I think even Felipe V told that he would claim throne of France if Louis XV died without heirs (but maybe he would have resign from his throne in Spain)
Ah you must have written it before OP's edit then
Maybe yeah, not sure what he meant
Any conqueror would fit "born foreigners" I suppose
:-/
Wouldn't that only exclude people who become American later in life, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
I imagine a child born in Europe with 2 US citizens as parents would still be recognized as American from birth
Quick Googling told me this:
>A person born abroad in wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother and a U.S. citizen father acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under section 301(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), if at least one of the parents resided in the United States or one of its outlying possessions prior to the person's birth
Nope, just wanted to add which French leaders were born abroad
I guess Delanoë is born in Tunisia, though he is retired
Actually there’s a theory that consciousness and language are tightly connected, but it’s hard to articulate and those are just suppositions
Yeah I spent a semester there for Erasmus, I quite enjoyed it
It was a long time ago but I remember there was some kind of free music festival, i went to some concerts and plenty of bars, so not so boring
Yes
Epiphany, we eat Galette des rois
But it's not a holiday
Yes we do, we call it "épiphanie", and  we eat a cake called "galette des rois" to celebrate the arrival of the 3 kings before Jesus Christ
My mom wait for epiphany to put the three rois mages (biblical magi) in her nativity scene
Some Christians do that to
Everyone (with family and sometimes at work) eat a cake called galette des rois
In some parts of France it is called gâteau des rois ou brioche des rois
I even have a piece of [king cake from 1871] at home
It is a souvenir from the siege of Paris by the Prussians in 1870-1871
I know, it’s weird
We call it Epiphanie and we eat a kind of pie with a surprise in it
We call the "pie" a "[galette des rois] the king's galette
(even in south of France they have [brioche] instead)
Inside there is a paste made with almond, the *frangipane*  and hidden in the paste, we have a [fève] *,* wich is a small figurine
The one who find the *fève* in his part become the king/queen and can chose a king/queen too
If you buy (that's what most people do) the *galette or the brioche*, it come with a golden paper crown
In private school kids would make their [own crown]
Many people collects those fève and it's traditionnaly small people reprensenting old fashioned jobs or [regional costumes] but you can have moderne one like [harry potter] disney or simpsons fève .
If there are children, the youngest one goes under the table and the person who cut the pie says "who's this one for
" and the kids say "oncle, daddy etc
" so it's more fair but it's also a great way for the aduts to have a look inside the pie and make sure the kid have the fève and the crown
I didn't even know today was supposed to be a special day of some kind
Yup
Here it's called Épiphanie and it's the day we eat the "Galette des Rois"
Same for us "épiphanie" where we eat the kings cake
But it's not a holiday, just a tradition
I would have called it a pie too but now you're making le doubt
Just look up "galette des rois", and be sure sure to choose the recipe with frangipane, as in southern France it is a different cake than in the North (brioche with candied fruits)
OHHH
Fuck I totally forgot this existed and was now, I thought it was way later in the year
Yeah it's kinda celebrated but it's not a holiday
Bien sûr que si que c'est largement célébré
Ah thanks, today I learned
I guess the king cake and galette des rois had the same origin and then everybody let their creativity go wild
What always weirded me out was the obviously artificial colours used for the cake
I mean, how did they make it back then
Great article, thanks
What I am going to describe hasn't really been valid this year because all the headlines have been about COVID no matter the season, but on normal years you will always get:
- Headlines about cold weather and snow in winter, complete with a long form interview with some random person who forgot to put his snow tires on and can't go to the store
- You guessed it, headlines about hot weather in summer, sometimes but not always linked to stories about global warming, but without fail, featuring some random person who decided to install /aircon/a swimming pool/an ice house/all of the above/ in their house
- The national high school exams are often considered prime exciting news, even though they always happen at the same time and in the same manner
- Same thing with the end of the summer break, you will be treated to parents shopping for backpacks and complaints about the latest education reform to fill the void
- The main TV news program often features thinly disguised ads for seasonal holiday destinations (beach towns in summer, ski stations in winter)
- Speaking about holidays, let's talk about journalist's favorite subjects when things get slow in summer: traffic jams
You will be taken to a journey on an unlikely village close to the highway who suddenly saw tens of thousands of cars come through because the highway was jammed and GPS apps told people to use secondary roads
This story lasts about two months and can be reused eternally since there are always new traffic jams to talk about
- I am probably forgetting most of them since I don't really watch that stuff anymore, but I am sure there are dozens more coming like clockwork every year
\-Dozens cars torched as "tradition" each end of year
\-How risky the new year will be for the president ( whoever he is )
Fairly good overview though
But let's not forget riots coverage in France
Everyone arguing the numbers, everyone arguing about the coverage, the people accusing the medias and the government, the medias accusing the other medias, everyone accusing everyone of accusing everyone, and so on
I remember the back to school period as well, with random people buying school supplies, random people in their house getting ready on D day, kids wanting to stay on holidays, others wanting to go back
We like having random people on French TV
There's also the 'oh it's raining' news, everytime it's raining heavily, and you guessed it, with some random people's opinions on the rain, it's flow, if they were affected by flood
(It's quite common as in the south, around Montpellier if my memories are correct, they put a lot of concrete everywhere, with the drought, when it's raining heavily, everything is flooded
Happens at least twice a year
Around January we'd also get daily updates on the Paris Dakar, endless reports about the origins of the Galette des Rois (with brioches fans fighting endlessly against frangipane aficionados), snow reports from ski resorts with at least one comical fall every 3 minutes
Something about bakeries selling Galettes des rois around the epiphany (shocking news)
People skiing down their last slope before going back to their sad parisian life
This, and we have our own "the hospital is collapsing
Doctors & nurses on strike, asking for better pay & recognition" every year (not especially January, flu season rather)
Conservative journalists saying France is doing worse than Germany because policies are too generous
My opinion on them is they are ~~merely~~ figuratively nostalgic of nazi occupation, fantasizing German efficiency and vowing a cult to "strong leaders", pure neocon imo
Haha, we do this with cigarettes
>Everyone arguing the numbers,
"9000 participants in the protests according to the police, 75000 according to the organizers"
Hardly surprising, with their inventive way of counting:
We have them all but I think the petition because some exam was too hard is a more recent phenomenon
Rarely have I read such bullshit
Typical uninformed left-wing criticism of the supposedly non-existent German welfare state, compared to the oh so generous French social state
Your preposterous amalgamation of Germanophile right-wingers with neonazis aside, your analysis of the German welfare state is outdated
It is certainly not the most generous in the world nor in Europe, but it is probably on-par if not even more efficient than France’s. Especially in healthcare
Which also explains why right-wingers and left-wingers like to refer to the German model
For different reasons, of course, but the idea that Germany got rid of the welfare state is just uninformed
The countless debates around the 'media's numbers', countless arguments around who wants to diminish the numbers and what
Mec, that's my point
They believe France should do less social, because they fantasize Germany does less social
And you cannot say these journalists are Germanophile, they're drooling over their fantasies of an hard-working and obedient society that France isn't and Germany is (in their minds)
I never spoke about neonazis, i spoke of neocon, and of occupation, and my point was about occupation, not about nazism (i did not intend to speak about that, those journalist dont speak about it)
And "Germany got rid of the welfare", did i say that ? Nooope, i did not, and am fairly aware they (to sum it up) downgraded it under Schroeder then upgraded it back under Merkel when they could afford it
My point is i believe journalists like Pascal Praud dont want to acknowledge that, they prefer to push forward their political agenda of getting rid of welfare state over the lie that Germany is successful because it does not do welfare state
"Exilé au milieu des nuées,
Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher"
L'Albatros by Charles Baudelaire, in which the poet is depicted as an albatross, struggling to relate to Mankind and to feel adequate among humans
(Exiled among the thick clouds (mankind, reality) / Its wings more fitted for a giant prevents it from walking)
"Demain dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne,
Je partirai
Demain dès l'aube by Victor Hugo, in which the poet talks to someone about a long trip he's making, to see their grave
It was written in memory of his daughter who drowned
(Tomorrow starting at dawn, at the time where fields become white (because of the morning light) / I'll leave)
Fun fact: I study German and those are the two I was taught in highschool
I learned the whole poem because I liked it, & the first few lines of the Faust because I had to (still liked it)
So you can probably say that those are also the most well-known outside of your country
It's always set in Paris, in the pretty touristic spots with a lovely weather, so not really
I can't think of one as of now
I learned about Bruges in Yoko Tsuno (the comics), and have dreamed to visit ever since
Learning that it’s a tourist trap was both logical and a disappointment, haha :) I’ll visit anyway, I’m a tourist after all
Spider man - Homecoming was a nightmare to watch
Less than five minutes in the Netherlands, about 100% cliché (though not those on drugs & prostitutes)
And I’m saying that as a French, so I can’t imagine what it was like as a Dutch
It's one of my favorite movies
This
The same is true for France, which is often 1
just Paris, 2
super romantic in foreign movies
And the Emilia (is that the name
) series that’s currently _the_ thing in the USA, it seems
man, that’s a nightmare
Awful, not at all representative
It's such a shame
There is so much that could be done to make a cool movie set in switzerland
Without evil bank or nazi gold involved
Haha, my bad
Don't forget to say Hello, Thank You and Goodbye in stores, with a little smile
Doesn't need to be in French, even in English or your native language, that is just a basic untold rule here, and quite probably the reason why you find people in service rude in France
kill someone
Expect train to arrive in time
Your worst nightmare would be a clown
Fine then, we wont
But you know, we've got all these guillotines gathering dust in our prisons, it would be a shame not to use them
just say the word and we can lend them to you for a lil revolution or two
>How is IKEA viewed in your country, if you have one
If you have one what, IKEA or country
Cheap, functionnal, not too bad design wise, but quality is crap
buying *new* ikea furniture is a luxury for sure (okay, not really, but i wouldn't call it cheap either), the budget option is to buy one of the thousands of identical ikea desks/tables/bookshelves that are for sale for dirt cheap on whatever your local craigslist equivalent is
Even here where the average income it's pretty good I view it as expensive, I mean every time you go here to buy a few things you have a €1000 hole in your wallet
Sure, 150€ isn't much, but because of how many of them end up on reseller sites, it'll cost you 15€ to get it used
I dunno man, maybe I'm a huge cheapskate, but I just don't see the point of buying new under these circumstances
Well, still waiting for you and the Danes to get really serious about Skåne ! It's brewing, but we dont see shit ! C'mon guys, show us the Vikingness in your blood and go raid and claim that bloody land once and for all !
**/s**    (just in case someone takes me seriously)
Ah, banter, the best way to insult with honesty removed
During the Cold War, I can see why it was a thing
Now, it seems making less sense
I would like Europe to defend itself
Say, if Poland and the Baltic States need support, I would prefer Europeans troops, and European gear
I think they are an obstacle in the way of a credible European defence system
This must be one of the subject where the answers mostly vary in function of the nationality of those who say it !
Be it here or IRL, I don't know a single polish guy that is against them and a single french guy in favour of them
That being said, for Europe as a whole, I don't know
That doesn't matter to us a lot and I'm obviously against them in my own country (The russian threat is nearly non-existent in France, to be brutally honest
But I can understand why some countries would prefer the US to an exclusively european alternative in the current situation
I mean, my country maybe has the most credible armed force in the EU (certainly once the UK leaves)
But it still is far away from Russia and we clearly do not have the same projection capacities of the USA
Our track record as an ally is not stellar either
And, again,  the french don't really care about Russia
Most are either indifferent toward the current policy or want appeasement, very rare are those in favour of a more hostile stance toward Russia
In this context, I feel like in the case the US end their involvement in Europe, France would be put in the rather uncomfortable position of protecting a very large part of the whole EU border for a period of transition before a credibly EU army is formed
And I don't think It would be politically tenable here to do this without asking for sizable political and/or monetary compensations from the EU members that benefit the most from it
And as I understood from my various conversations, such compensations are out of question and the status quo is nearly unanimously considered as prefferable if it's possible to maintain
I think the issue is fundamentally that there are no real feelings of kinship between people inside the union
I think It's fair to say that the French are very foreign to Estonians, Latvians or Poles
And I'm quite confident the opposite is also vey true
In this context, I can't really blame nations to act egoistically and to choose the most cost-efficient option
And it would be outright dishonest to imply US involvement is not the most cost-efficient
Till there is a real feeling of kinship between europeans, I feel like the idea of a completely independent EU-wide defense force would most definitely have to be forced on us
That being said, I feel the bases in Netherlands, Belgium and Italy have had their time and no longer serve any real purpose for europeans
Instead, the countries who really wish to have more insurance against Russia (Baltics and Poland mostly) should get them instead
There is nothing to think about when you're a voluntary carpet for American's boots
Tout à fait
Et avant même une armée il faudrait commencer par acheter du matériel militaire européen plutôt qu'américain
Oh gotcha, so "y'all" are in Europe out of pure kindness, it's obvious now
Thank you for opening my eyes kind overlords
Va dire ça aux Belges, aux Néerlandais, aux Polonais et j'en passe
C'est bien eux que je vise
Ils font moins cas des 40 000 GI parce qu'ils ont connu une occupation soviétique assez récemment, et que globalement la région qu'ils ont occupé a encore un très gros retard sur les autres 30 ans plus tard
C'est un peu pareil que leur peur du nucléaire qui parait étrange de ce côté du Rhin, qui s'explique aussi principalement par la Guerre Froide et leur rôle en temps que champ de bataille
Des deux maux, ils (comprendre : Le gouvernment
La population est plus divisée sur la question de ce que j'ai pu comprendre) préfèrent ne pas s'éloigner des US qui n'ont pas été des "occupants" particulièrement dérangeants dans les 70 années qui ont précédé (en tout cas en Europe, incontestablement) afin de constituer une menace crédible face à la Russie sans avoir à en assumer réellement les coûts
Il faut bien avouer qu'une armée européenne, pour être crédible, demanderait un gros budget que l'immense majorité des pays dont on parle n'est pas prêt à assumer actuellement
Il faut avouer qu'un effet secondaire de cette aide américaine est que ces pays peuvent se permettre d'avoir un budget défense assez faible, autant d'argent que l'état peut dépenser dans des projets qui sont visiblement plus utiles pour la population et/ou réduire le déficit (plutôt ce qui arrive dans les faits)
Là où par exemple, la Suède (non membre de l'OTAN) a rétabli la conscription obligatoire suite à l'occupation de la Crimée.
Je dirais que si tu es plutôt habitué à la perspective FR sur la question et que celle des autres européens (principalement allemands) te surprend, je dirais que c'est parce que globalement la France diffère de beaucoup de pays d'Europe parce que les gens ici ont BEAUCOUP moins peur de la Russie que la plupart des pays d'Europe*.
C'est d'autant plus marqué parmi ceux qui s'intéressent à la politique puisqu'en France ils sont même généralement plutôt en faveur d'une politique d'apaisement/neutralité face à la Russie
En 2017, un politicien de premier plan en France a évoqué la possibilité d'une négociation avec la Russie sur la question des conflits non résolus aux frontières
Et très franchement pas grand monde en a parlé à l'époque, encore une fois tout le monde s'en tape
Je peux t'assurer avec une quasi-certitude qu'il est clair que ça serait un suicide électoral dans l'immense majorité de la population dans les pays qui sont très représentés ici et encore plus sur r/europe (où il y a beaucoup d'utilisateurs d'Europe de l'Est)
PS : De plus, les pays qui ont vraiment peur de la Russie ont plutôt tendance à être sur la pente montante, tandis que ceux qui s'en foutent un peu perdent en importance à cause de performances économiques au mieux médiocres
Donc je pense que le status quo n'est pas prêt de bouger
Clairement, il n'y aura pas d'armée européenne avant que les allemands n'emboîtent le pas aux français
Avant cela il ne se passera rien
Chocolate, all the best ones are made in Europe (though I have never tasted Ecuadorian chocolate, this one has also a good reputation)
obviously cheese and bread
But a case could be made for the large majority of foods due to european laws on food quality
Best baguette I’ve ever had in my life was in
Costa Rica
And then Spain
Not sure if I’m just getting lucky (or unlucky
) or what
I'm too ashamed to tell that irl, but my favorite fromage is italian : the gorgonzola
I somewhat agree
Desserts from the Maghreb are insane
> Austrian and German cheese is competitive
German cheese is not heavily marketed for exports and Austrian cheese is exported here, but not a lot to other countries
Some are nice but they're not super diverse, not very strong
There is a law here where restaurants can't refuse you a glass of tap water
Even if you don't eat
And when you take tap water with your lunch, it will always be free
They have nothing in common
I wish I could tell you more but I've had them once or twice a long time ago but I remember being amazed by them
There were flavours that I wasn't familiar with at all but that I enjoyed a lot
Yeah, to be fair it's an extremely low bar, considering how the vast majority of Europeans can't handle spice
Yeah perhaps I wasn't clear enough, I was agreeing with your fellow brit and talking about how the rest of Europe can't handle it
There is one shop here in Lyon where I buy stuff from time to time
It’s a Russian shop though, but they offer a lot of Polish stuff too like Krakowska, frozen pierogis or twaróg (so I can make my own pierogis, waaaaay better than frozen
They have many other “treats” too, for me it is the stuff I was used to eating while on holidays in Poland
Can't say I've ever seen one
Poles have assimilated
In France, none, or maybe some few
But if there is a "Polish" grocery store, it probably sell more things that have nothing to do with Poland
And no, you can't buy Polish specialties (unless I've never heard of them, I don't even know their specialties)
I'm in a big city in the South of France, and while we do not have strictly speaking Polish groceries, we do have Russian groceries that also have Polish (and other Eastern Europe countries) items, due to the fact that we have a big Russian-Armenian diaspora in town
It's not a country anymore, but I've always been fascinated by their history: the Roman republic, then empire, and its continuity in what've been called the Byzantine empire, and also its legacy in most of european countries which still exist today: it's amazing that so many country did claim themselves of the Roman empire
More than 2 millenia of continued administration and influence by the Roman, their history is so rich, diverse, and everyone in the world is or has been influenced by the roman civilization, it's fascinating
Germany
Besides the world wars, I realized I didn't really know much about the country, and its history is quite interesting
Also I'm learning German and it's quite helpful to know more about Germany (cultural context, jokes and references)
The Roman Empire
Korea, weird little piece of land stuck between giant China and agressive Japan
Add to this a language that is prety much isolated is the region and a religion where erudition=power and you're in for a weird mix
Mesoamerica and South Korea and my picks
Both have such fascinating history
Check out Peter Frankopan's [Silk Roads] if you haven't already
A true madlad
1870
And maybe tell a certain someone that no, he's not ready for war with Prussia and he should hire better tacticians
Telling Louis XVI he has to reform real quick or giving the Wikipedia Waterloo page to Napoleon before the battle starts
A week would be far from enough for France but I guess during 1789 in Paris for the Revolution, or maybe 1870 during La Commune de Paris, or maybe sometimes during le Siècle des Lumières, or maybe sometimes during the Grand Conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, or maybe sometimes during the First Crusade
February 1848, the french Revolution for the 2nd republic
If it was guaranteed that I could not be killed I would love to see the siege of Alesia during the Gallic Wars
Or 1871, see the Commune of Paris
Maybe you mean the early web
The early internet was mostly email, ftp, rsh/rcp, then usenet and then gopher
The early web was (for me) very exciting
A page listed all the new http servers and another page gave awards for the best ones
I was awarded a best 25% of the web in 94 or 95
Exciting times
Yes that was my thought too
Actually Louis XVI wanted to reform, thing is he lost the minister Vergennes few days before the assembly starts and he was one of his best and smart advisor
So when the things went out of control he had the choice between  calling the troops or letting the Parisians taking over and when the latter came to Versailles asking the king to send away the armies camping near Paris he accepted because he wanted to avoid any civil war or bloodbath ( the two previous centuries showed how the monarchy struggled with the civil wars )
And one of his biggest mistake is to call back the Parliaments after Louis XV and his minister Maupeou banished them few decades earlier and made the justice free because they were contesting the monarchy and access to courts of justice by common people was expensive
Sadly Louis XV rule is not very teached despite it was the positive peak of the absolute monarchy
Louis XVI biggest weakness was his lack of good advisors in the end
I can huuuuum along the USAian, German, English, and the best of all the Russian one ( I find la Marseillaise pretty epic, but, the USSR one is one rank above)
I know it's not an official one but "O flower of Scotland" is beautiful and I love to hear it
And the Brits get a lot of shit for "Goooood saaaaave zeeeeee queeeeeen" but they have "Land of Hope and Glory"... Why don't they use that one
The old East German anthem is so fucking cool
I just watched the video, it's disappointing on the French side haha
I could definitely hum it, but I only know the first two sentences of the first verse (Über alles)
I don't.
Yes they were more talented at national anthems than at managing a state hahaha
I didn't even know that
Pretty much the  same
It’s generally seen as tasteless and crass
I suppose it depends what you call showing off wealth though
It’s okey to own nice things and all but bragging about money is seen as crass
You already know how the wealthy flex in the US
The richer the "better" and the "you ain't shit unless you're flexin'" mindset is strong
It depends how you show wealth though
Expensive things are okay if they are perceived as simple and "elegant".  They're not if they're loud and very visible
So my guess would be wearing [this watch] is ok, but definitely not [that one] even though the gold rolex costs half the price of the patek
How to become public enemy #1 101

Here in France it's Plus Belle La Vie (A Brighter Life), it takes place in Marseille and tell the tales of people (idk very much i've never watched it)
>it takes place in Marseille and tell the tales of people
j'aime beaucoup cette description
Only 17 seasons and 4600+ episodes but it has only been going on since 2004
I tried watching it with a few friends during lockdown and it was surprisingly not so bad
Definitely had a good time
Les Feux de l'Amour ont 48 saisons et douze mille épisodes et c'est pas fini
Demande à tes (grand-)parents pour un résumé, ça passe depuis la fin des années 80
J'ai fait du mieux que j'ai pu
Si t'as passé un bon moment alors c'est une bonne série
Ma foi
En soi c'était pas non plus un grnad moment mais avec des potes et une bière, c'était sympa
Some african accents are just too hard to understand
I really have troubles with thick accents from Northern France, and also with Paris subburbean popular accent youngsters have
Well their accent and their slang, it is a deadly combo
Accent from Marseille, in the south, is pretty unintelligible for me
Almost every quite strong accent, especially when Texans are trying to speak french
It’a really close to the south alsacian dialect
I spent quit some time in Vorarlberg and it was easier to me to speak in alsacian than to speak German to make me understood
And people from the Pyrenees
(Jean Lasalle for exemple
As the other guy said as we have a lot of immigrants yes we get to here a lot of accents in our country
I have no problem with the accents from overseas, they are very understandable, more than quebecois
But they are some people that spoke french as their first language and comes from somewhere in Africa that I struggle a lot to understand
How often does it snow in your country ?
Here in north-eastern France, it used to snow quite a lot from January to March, but it's been a few years that it hasn't really snowed
T'habites où en northeastern France ? Pour voir si on a la même météo
Well there's a mix between global warming and colding because I hate the fact that we have 5°C every morning while 2 weeks ago there was still 35°C that's absolutely incomprehensible
En Lorraine
Les Vosges ?
Non, en Moselle
Roh dommage :/
Pour une fois que j'aurais pu trouver un copain vosgien
In France tattoos and piercings, apart from the basic piercings for earrings, are generally frowned upon
They're probably more accepted now, but only by a small margin
They're not accepted in law firms though
If you wore one, people would comment behind your back
Space in between thousands, commas for decimals
1 235 678,45
In France, both
69 420,62€
69420,62€
are correct
We use commas as decimal separators and narrow no-break spaces as thousands separators, although people just type a simple space and usually the software (depends which one) will automatically replace it with the correct space
We also count like that, they sure need to be introduced milliards
Here we write 1,55 €
Same in France
Same here uwu
Oh you lucky I wish I had ´ on my keyboard and the fact that German has no accute accent but still has the key angers me
We have fricking "~" that we don't use in french but we still don't have a god damn acute dead key
Thé prõblëm îs thât wê hàvè äll ãççënts bùt thìs òñe
The "~" is used in breton, basque (not 100% sure about that one) and in math
So it is used
Not much but still
They're the norm now
I mean, most people are officially Catholic but actual believers are now less common than atheists
Especially in younger generations
As perfectly normal
34% are agnostic and 29% are atheist
So 63% of the population is irreligious
And we've had a very strict separation of state and religion since 1904, with our "laïcité" principle
If I'm not wrong, France is one of the most atheist country
Nobody really cares, excepted really religious person
There is another word people who hate religions and make that clear
It's antitheist
It’s stopped now (I think) but when Emmanuel Macron was elected there were a lot of jokes about the age difference between him and his wife (she’s 20+ years older than he is)
Macron's Wife used to be his french teacher
Macron vowed to be a "Jupiterian President". So, many of his detractors like to literally call him Jupiter to mock him
The guy has made many condescending and ignorant comments that did not help his case with that nickname
To many he comes off as arrogant and disconnected from reality, exactly like someone who sees himself as a God-President
Just to give a few examples of his numerous "dérapages" (slips) ;
He called the French people one of "Disobedient and refractory gauls".
He said that many of the workers from a specific plant he was visiting were "illiterate".
He bragged to a random guy about how he "earned his nice suit" and explained to him how "one just has to work for it"
He opposed those who succeed to "those who are nothing" etc
Absolutely anything that he does
Long life to Carl XVI Gustaf !
Sad that their age difference is not laughed at anymore ?
Why would you find this sad ?  I, on the contrary, am very happy that the joking has stopped : when you see a man with a much younger woman, nobody makes jokes about that
He met his wife when he was 15 and she was 39
This is fucked up, no matter which way you look at it
Probably used to be a typo and 6edfIsh corrected themselves
Oh, I’d misunderstood you
Yes, I agree with you, of course
Let them be
Who cares about their age
What matters is how competent he is as a politician,  not his private life !
Probably
But I wouldn’t accuse people without proof either
From what I remember reading in the papers there was nothing improper between them at the time
They met when he was 15 but got in a relationship when he was 16
>En mai 1993, dans l'atelier de théâtre qu'elle anime au lycée de la Providence, elle remarque Emmanuel Macron, alors âgé de quinze ans et élève de seconde dans la même classe que sa fille Laurence
>**L'année suivante**, le couple commence une relation
La différence d'âge (de plus de 24 années) entre les deux amants provoque un scandale dans la famille Trogneux : leur relation tombe sous le coup de la **loi du 23 décembre 1980 et du délit d'atteinte sexuelle sur mineur, qui dispose qu’un enseignant qui a des relations sexuelles avec un élève mineur âgé de plus de quinze ans encourt jusqu’à trois ans de prison**. Leur relation se poursuit discrètement à Paris, où Emmanuel Macron entre en classe de terminale, puis en classes préparatoires littéraires au lycée Henri-IV
And yet she didn’t lose her job nor was she prosecuted
Maybe she should have been or not, your guess is as good as mine
We don’t know the facts, and besides, it’s none of our business
One piece of advice : don’t believe everything you read in Wikipedia as gospel
Subject closed
This is old news anyway, and I’m beginning to feel as bored about it as our British friends are feeling about Megxit !
Oh I don't really care neither about it
I'm not the kind of person that will always put that on the table to criticize Macron, that's just stupid
I just answered to your "there was nothing improper between them at the time" because it seemed to me that it was incorrect
With an s sound
I don't think I've ever heard someone go with an -sh sound in French
With an "s", no reason to pronounce it differently here
Yes, people having knowledge and respect for other cultures, what wankers
I would argue on the difficulty of pronouncing "zs" for non native speakers compared to the 's' as we have in Latin languages or anglo-saxon
I have a hungarian friend named "Zsófia" and the "zs" is, from my understanding, somewhere in between 's', 'sh' with a bit of 'j'. I'm not certain I can still pronounce it properly
Edit: add forgotten accent in the name
Tu te compliques beaucoup trop la vie, c'est le même son que le j dans bonjour :)
Ah merde, si j'avais su
I lived 15 years in Réunion Island, when people go to France they say it like that, as if Réunion is not part of France
In the local journal 3/5 are on local news 1/5 on national, and the rest on sport
Being born on the island comes with a real identity another language derived from French (and french), another cuisine, unique music, others tradition and culture (the island is really multicultural) etc
So I feel that most réunionnais will see themselves as their ethnicity, réunionnais then French
For the EU, it's considered as a poor territory where investment are necessary
And man they really invest : if there is a new infrastructure most of the time the EU was part of it
It's more of a general issue with the EU but people don't understand it, it seems like there is a robot printing and giving money and not real people coming
So people are grateful I guess but don't feel part of thf EU
Also most of réunionnais don't speak English so is hard to feel connected with other nationality and the EU when you don't have access to it
For your last question about relatives : there is a lack of interesting jobs in la Réunion so most reunionnais do have relatives in France
Yes, France bought the island from the Knight Hospitallers and then trade it to Sweden for some warehouses in Götheburg (no idea how it is written)
Swede renamed Le Carénage into Gustavia
But almost a century later Sweden gave it back after a referendum among the locals
Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin
Then go conquer the world
- Japanese because I like stuff from Japan and I like it's culture in general
- Russian because idk sounds really cool
- and Armenian because I have some Armenian origins and kinda wants to learn it
German, Japanese, and Cantonese
The first two are spoken in some of my favorite countries on the planet, and the third would be a way for me to reconnect with my roots (and have conversations at my favorite bakeries/restaurants in Chinatown
Russian, Arabic and Mandarin
Being able to access resources in those languages seems super important to understand the major non western powers, and generally stuff that doesn't derive from a culture that's similar to mine
Also, that'd allow me to get much closer to other languages of the same families, so I'll be able to quickly learn polish and Maltese at last :)
Turkish, Russian and Arabic because I like how they sounds and the culture/history
I speak English quite well so I won't pick it and French is my native language
I would say German, Mandarin and Russian or Hindi or Greek, or even an ancient language
I love these languages and they're difficult so I would save a lot of learning time
\- Mandarin because I feel like it's an elegant language
\- Russian because I just like how it sounds
\- Icelandic because I love this country and it seems to me they sounds more "nordic" than the others  Scandinavians languages
I agree
I'm learning English since 6-7 years at school
I made little progress for 4 years (6th-9th grade), I could undertand 20% of the language
And then I became more interested in English and started to watch/read English things on my own and I made a huge progress in 2-3 years (10th-12th grade)
Now I understand 95% of the language
So yes, for anyone learning, don't give up !
English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic and
Oh right thanks
That seems obvious now considering the members of the UN Security Council lol
That was a great read, especially as a lager lover
Cheers
Nationale police and Gendarmerie ( military police doing police mission as well ) are armed and since the terrorist attacks few years ago you can see them patrolling with rifles in cities
Beside each cities have their own little police force ( police municipale ) and they can allow their officers to be armed or not, it mostly depends of the elected mayor
Also in french cities you have soldiers patrolling as well since we are still under terrorist alert, they have all rifles but they can't do anything without orders
For exemple when there were the Bataclan attack four years ago, there was soldiers next to the site but they just waited orders outside before going in meanwhile 2 policemen asked them to at least give them their rifles so they can go in, but they declined because orders
So the policemen went into the building with their pistols against terrorist with rifles, they managed to kill one and then went out with survivors
There was a huge scandal about that because if the soldiers would have been allowed to go in maybe more lifes could have been saved
Instead terrorist were executing their hostages by time passing while the special police forces were deployed hours laters
They're just patrolling to make people feel safer and supposedly to deter terrorists
That's about all they do
They are always communicating with the chain of command, via radio or even cellphones sometimes
The issue here isn't that they were waiting orders that never came, the issue is that orders were given to NOT go inside
Probably the [military police] The [nationale police] has G36 but I don't think they ever had Famas
The [military patrols] have always a camo uniform
They do have radios
And they intervened at multiple occasions but mostly because they were the ones attacked
Example :
They were right about the Bataclan attack
They received the order to engage the terrorists if they went outside though, but not to intervene inside
Slightly
Those soldiers are military and can come from different corps, including légionnaires
So it makes sense to have them strictly follow orders and take no initiative
In the case of the Bataclan attack it’s more a misconception from uneducated (on the subject) people
Hostages situations are a very shitty mess and there’s a reason for it being GIGN / Raid / BRI (or spec ops, as we’re talking about military) stuff
But excepted that it doesn’t erase the many criticism against Operation Sentinelle, especially among the military (mainly the cost for a discussed efficiency and the massive weight it represents for the logistics / troops)
Six continents: Africa, America, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, Oceania
I later on learned that technically speaking (for geographers) Asia & Europe are one continent, as they’re not separated by an ocean
Here in France, I was taught that there are 6 continents:
\- Europe
\- Asia
\- America (we did not separate North America from South America which are regional distinctions but our teachers were always careful to remind us that the term "America" when referring to the USA is contentious
\- Africa
\- Antarctica
\- Oceania (we never called it "Australia" which is always used to refer to the country
It could be because France possesses overseas territories in Oceania so this continent is often talked about
America is a single continent, Oceania is another including teritories from New guinea to french Polynesia
Same in France
Same over here
There is technically no more link between Europe-Asia and Africa, because of the Suez pass
I don’t know what geographers make of it, though
Shit, our cities have been designed around cars and public transportation
Bicycle lanes have been painted to the detriment of traffic lanes, without providing secure bicycle parking
The result
More traffic jams and the usual theft of bikes
And some places are quite dangerous, trucks can't always control their blind spots in one ways
In the Paris region a lot of money is invested in public transportation, their exceptional density (One station every 200m in Paris) makes it possible to do without bicycles anyway
Future lines extensions will help to relieve congestion in the heavily loaded segments
In Bordeaux (south-west of France) I can't complain, we have a bike lane everywhere, and a bike highway that directly go to the ocean, if you have a bus subscription, you can use closed bike shelters, and we've got 100€ from the government and the city to help repair a bike
Nice question : they recently added cycling roads everywhere in my city a'd now the car traffic is an absolute nightmare, clogging the entire city because of a waaay overkill biking network that very few people actually use
This was clearly done just so the higher up in Paris think of our mayor as a good guy and not actually for us
Lol France does the same a lot
Just got one today so I can explain in detail
We usually meet at midday but it's more polite to come a bit late (one hour max)
Then we take the "apéro" which is just a lot of alcohol and salted biscuits while saying hello to everyone and "install" you
After this we have many dishes until comes the dessert and the coffee
Children go play between different dishes
We usually end between 16 and 18 hours
Then we take a walk or play some games with everyone and sometimes when people come from far, they sleep at the place and go back home one or more days after it
Family gatherings are a mess
At least 70 people, every adult get drunk at some point of the night, songs that we-all-know-by-heart-but-pretend-we-don't play after some time, delicious food and everyone ends up shouting "Les Lacs du Connemara" at least once before the break of dawn
I love it
We generally talk about the actuality, politics, our jobs, family matter etc
have a disagreement then talk again like a debate, we all speak at the same time of course  and laught a lot, then have a walk or play pétanque, if we have time cause we starts the apéro a 11:30am, stats to eat a 12:30 and finish at about 4pm
then maybe a last coffee or tea
Some time we make a pause after the cheese for the pétanque or the walk or just a chat and eat the dessert as a snack at 4pm
Kids stay for the diner but are allowed to go to play during the cheese and come back for the dessert but most like to have cheese too
Then at 5 or 6pm it' s over
For birthdays it's the same exept the dessert is a cake, we sing the song and open the gifts
No such thing as a family gathering in my family, unless someone dies
This exactly
Also, not all members of the family are always present (at least in my family’s case)
Seems rather small doesn't it
I have 15 cousins on my father's side (so with the uncles and aunts that's a lot of people), usually we just rent a place with a lot of bedrooms for the weekend and we basically talk and eat and drink from friday to sunday
Don't forget "Les démons de minuit"
It was only for a birthday but yeah it's even longer for real family gatherings
It's a French song about Ireland, well-known in France :)
The numbers in French from France are beyond stupid
60 = soixante (everywhere)
70 = septante (Belgium) = soixante dix (sixty ten) in French from France
80 = ~~octante~~ huitante (Switzerland) = quatre vingt (four twenty) in French from France
90 = nonante (Belgium) = quatre vingt dix (four twenty ten) in French from France
"Mais qu'est-ce que c'est que ça " which can be translated by " But what is this that this is that that "
Qu'est ce que c'est que ça ?
What is this that this is that that ?
What is This ?
" Les cuisiniers excellent à faire ce mets excellent
""The cooks are good at making this excellent dish"
Not only "excellent" is not pronounced the same way in the two apparition of the word (the first one is silent on the "nt"), "mets" (dish) have a "S" in his singular form, while it's a common rule for french words to take a "S" on their plurarl nouns only
This is one exception
Why ? I don't know
Swiss (from Valais, Vaud or Fribourg) say "huitante" not "octante". Source: I lived in Lausanne for quite some years
Interesting, didn't know that
Apparently octante is no longer said, I updated my comment accordingly

Since they aren't necessarily called the same in other languages, it took me a minute to figure out a good half of the list, but ok I got them all, that's reassuring
I'd add one of the philosophes des lumières, probably Voltaire, since most of us had to read Candide/Zadig in school
Also we had a lot of history about Clovis, Charlemagne (sorry for the Germans), Henry IV (or at least l'édit de Nantes) and François the first so some of them are probably remembered by most of us
Also Molière, Saint Exupery and Jean Moulin
Charles Monet ? Don't you mean Claude ?
I don't think *everybody* knows about Debussy
I'd even say many people don't know Baudelaire or Monet either
Marie Curie, Georges Clemenceau, Jean de la Fontaine, Jules Verne, Jean Jaurès, Alexandre Dumas, Vercingétorix are pretty famous and celebrated, more than Debussy or Monet I would say
Descartes and Rousseau were already said I think
Joyeux jour de gâteau !
I don't see an issue that Charlemagne is mentioned for multiple countries, as his empire contained multiple of nowadays countries and as he was counted as a French king and a German emperor by his sons
I'm surprised there aren't more painters, like Vermeer, Bosch, Rubens, Bruegel
Edit: sorry I confused with Flemish painters in the end, as their place of birth was sometimes in modern Netherlands
Doesn't Ann Frank count as well ?
Not sure Marc Dutrou deserved his place between all those men (there's a definite lack of women in this whole thread)
I mean, *yes* he's famous, but does he deserves to be listed
I'm not quite sure
Of course
Yeah, there is so much famous french people that everyone knows about !
Oh it's just I did not think about him at the moment I answered the post ! But for sure, Robespierre belongs there
Do French people know that much about Robespierre in particular
The Revolution period is so intense to learn, a lot of names pop up and we have to cram them all until the next exam, but after the exam
Corrected ! Thank you, I was a bit distracted
And that's sad
I'd say monet is well know because we had to study in school (but tbf I can't say for sure if everyone studied it)
Marie Curie wasn't french before living in France
Yeah but you're going to summon the Polish nationalist keyboard army if you mention Marie Curie received a French nationality along her way or if you forget her maiden name
Thank you for adding some content :)
I put him in because someone mentionned Hitler for the German or Austrian answer
The question here is : which historical figure do everyone in your country knows about
Like it or not but this son of a bitch is sadly part of Belgium history :( For sœur Sourire : I am actually talking about Sœur Emmanuelle who was a belgium nonne who was cannonised by the Pope
Also, Marie-Antoinette
I would say he's the most famous person strictly associated to the French revolution
De rien :)
So what
She got French nationality
Were Clovis and Charlemagne born French
She was also Polish (although there was no Poland anymore at her time) but in France she is recognized as a French woman
The cases are different though
Chopin has a French father, but has widely told to be Polish and he was considered as such by himself and the people of his time
He was considered the national Polish composer
You're too late
I never knew her maiden name, so no way to forget it
But overall, we do consider her as French and Polish, and as a national figure (just looking on Google her name brings so much programs and official pages)
But I understand they're pissed when she's sometimes mentioned as just French, while she made great effort to keep links with Poland, recreate an independent country with WW1, taught Polish to her children, was poorly treated in the French press (breaking a good French marriage, as if Langevin wasn't responsible for cheating on his wife, and being told to go back home) and with institutions (only when she became worldwide famous or made a tour in the USA did the French institutions finally decided to give her some prizes and decorations)
If the Germans in this thread are counting Hitler because he got the German citizenship along the way, then we can count her
And we didn't get mad because they counted Charlemagne
Feel free to add every famous dual citizen or citizen from predecessor states to your tally as well
Same there
Danton and Mirabeau too, aren't they
Maybe Marat too
You talk about the movies ? :p
They're still considered France's historical figures, and the kingdom of France is in direct continuity with Francia (kingdom of the Franks)
Also there was no Poland when Marie Curie was born, and countries like Italy and Germany were created 150 years ago, but their people didn't suddenly appear
Chopin has a bigger connection, but he actively claimed to be Polish and not French, and even asked to bring back his heart to Warsaw after his death
Marie Curie did not make the same choice, she did keep attachments to Poland (like the Polonium element), taught Polish to her children (one became Nobel prize winner and first woman minister in France), chose Polish nannies and helped to build a scientific institute in Poland, but as her friend Émile Borel said about her "she shared feeling between Poland, her native country, and France, her adoptive country". Of course, it would be wrong to pretend she is only French (as she is not), but she accepted to represent France and actively participated for France in the first World War (it also profited Poland but still)
The French press and institutions weren't always kind to her when she was still alive, but in the end there is absolutely no doubt France has accepted her as a national historical figure
Her body was even transferred to the Panthéon in 1995, in presence of the Polish president
I get what you mean, just that in France, we consider national figures people born long before there was a fixed idea of what France was (like Vercingétorix back in Antiquity), because they lived in what is today France's territory
And Charlemagne's son Louis I is the first Louis of France that goes until Louis XVIII
Vercingetorix isn't considered a french historical figure though
That said, Charlemagne and Clovis are, at least by popular standards (historians may disagree, since the franks weren't exactly the same as what french people became)
Originally, French kings were said to be Troy ans but from XIXth century, Napoléon III and finally the IIIrd Republic, Vercingétorix entered the French national roman and is still widely taught as school (unless it has completely changed)
His fight against the invador was put in parallel with the 1870 defeat against Prussia
Astérix is basically taken from this fight
I signed up on Reddit just for this thread lol

The English here in France are generally the WORST by far, spend tons of money getting ripped off and the guys seem to compete about who's going to spend more "MATE I CAN BUY 2 ROUNDS IN A ROW NO PROBLEM"; that kind of bullshit drives me nuts as a bartender
The Dutch/Scands/Germans/Eastern Europeans love EDM way too much
&#x200B;
Much love to the Spanish and Portuguese
By FAR the best tourists
I like how it sounds, can't really explain why
Maybe more "vowel" sounds makes it pleasant to hear
I also appreciate that the grammar is not too complicated
What I really don't like is that I never know how to pronounce new words
Or even some words I've known for a long time, know how to write and use, but never heard
Overall I enjoy it, but it's probably also because it can be used to communicate with almost anyone
Not sure how to compare it
Our spelling is a lot more consistent (even if not obvious at first if you don't know the rules), but our grammar is a lot more messy
I'll usually not use it in the same context, so not really something that can be compared for me
I like it as a language
What I particulary love however is hearing and speaking to non-native speaker in English
We got a chance to meet this situation pretty often here in Europe when you're abroad and in a highly touristic area
( basically every capital to begin with )
You know the so called international-English or " airport-English " or whatever it is really called, it makes the situation even more lovely in my opinion
Everyone throw their accents, tones, way of speaking English, habits from their native language and so on, that's beautiful
Sometimes you could just guess where someone is from just by the way they speak *their* English, well that was a fun game back in the days we could freely travel and book some hostel nights
Damn I love those moments, you could feel people were pretty cautious at articulating or even explaining their feelings with some dumb vocabulary to be mutually intelligible
They knew the burden to speak a language they aren't that familiar with, that's something I can relate when I try to speak to an American / British / Irish ( whoever from the Anglosphere ), sometimes I just can't keep up with the pace or the accent ( looking at you Brits / Irish )
PS : In that regard, I was busted fairly often, since we are not that good at hiding our French accent, zis is trou
I speak it purely for practical reasons
It’s not the ugliest language around but I like French and Italian way better
It's a very easy language with almost no grammar and conjugation and you can communicate easily, joke or have serious discussions with people who are not native english speakers as well
I wouln't say it's ugly although I feel like english lacks some style and melody, it's a very neutral and useful language imho
I love the dad jokes
We have wordplays in French of course, but they work very differently
I like how English creates very small expression for new things, when in French we have to use periphrasis (but I hate when one tries to literally translate them in French, I love my periphrasis too)
I dislike how imprecise your vocabulary feels
I know that there are a lot of very precise technical sociolects, with very precise vocabularies, but “everyday English” makes difficult to have deep conversations (beyond the obvious fact that I do not master this everyday English)
Hot take but I think English is one of the worst Indo-European languages, as I hate it's phonology so much
&#x200B;
Plus I also feel bad that it overwhelm other languages (Welsh, Irish,...) and I also hate that today we are kinda "forced" to learn it if we want to go international as it's very rare to quasi-impossible to find some other language speaking comunity outside of the one country it's spoken except English of course
However, I'm still having a hard time to convey my idea from French to English basically, it always seems toned down because I can't find the right vocabulary or the right way to assemble my thoughts
I really don't know if it's related to my level in English or just the language itself
> also I'm currently learning French, and while I love it, it is making me  want to die with some of its phrases (like why are there so many  combinations with que, ce and est)
About that, "qu'est-ce que c'est ?" is the right one because I see a lot foreigners using "qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?" to mean "what it is
" but the first one is the "authentic way" and the second a more emphasised way that you encounter way less often, if that give you some relief
But overall yea we use a ton of little words and prepositions to make our sentences
Yes, "er" ( pronounce roughly like E in Las Vegas ) or "ir" n French minus some exceptions because yeah French being French
And I believe "ar" / "ir" / "er" in Spanish
How about in Swedish ?
Congrats, no idea where "vachement" comes from despite it's widely used but french is a really fucked up language when you think about it, it comes from latin mostly but had an heavy celtic influence so there is some weird things like prononciation, sentences structures and some numbers
If you made your way through this I do respect that
Hey at least I speak it
This is pretty much the 101 for any languages in Europe it seems, except those Finno-Ugric folks
where are they ? Hungary ? Finns ?
Yes pretty much, I know for a fact that if it was a French name the S will be silent
All the schools have reopened at full capacity here, only higher education will resume in the autumn
No particular problems so far, the sanitary rules are respected
Nobody categorically refuse to wear a mask
Having my 12 years old daughter returning to school in Paris suburb makes me worry
They are in dummy age and fall brings lot of flus and crap with proximity
We shall see
Hmmm
No ? Where my mom worked (children from ~3 to ~10) there was only half kids at a time
In junior high school/high school, all the students didn't return
It's still very unclear how it will be in September
My wife is a teacher in high school, and she do not know if she will be in front of her students
I didn't say all the students were there, but technically it reopened
And I agree that the communication to the teachers is trash, good luck to your wife :)
Yeah, and that doesn't mean that all parents are willing to send their kids back
It wasn't just a matter of parents willing to send their kids back
The thing is, there was a limit of how much children there can be in one room, plus (again for children <10), there was so much to do in terms of cleaning/ making sure kids wash their hands enough / making sure they respected the distances that teachers were not able to their jobs as usual
For children > 10, only certain classes went back to school, and often it was student with difficulty, or that didn't really do the work at home during the lockdown
See my other comment, but yes, that was my point
And in high school, I do not know the numbers, but some students didn't went back at all, some for 2-3 days (at least in my wife's highschool)
Do you have some great or humoristic quotes from someone of your country ?
Here  in france  my favorite is "Do someone  actually believe  im gonna start a dictator career at 67 years  old " from de Gaulle
Is there  quotes  like this one from your country ?
Charles de Gaulle:
>Comment voulez-vous gouverner un pays où il existe 258 variétés de fromage ?
How do you want to govern a country where there are 258 varieties of cheese
&#x200B;
Coluche (a famous French humorist):
>Do you know why animal emblem of France is a cock
>Becasue that is the only bird than can sing with feet in manure
A famous debate happened during the 1988 French presidential election, between the two candidates (during the second part): the then-president François Mitterand, and the prime minister Jacques Chirac
(Basically there was a cohabitation at the time, between the president/chief of the state belonging to the PS -left- and the prime minister/chief of the government belonging to the RPR -right-.)
Jacques Chirac : Allow me to tell you (François Mitterand) tonight, that I am not the Prime Minister, and that you are not the President
We are two candidates, on an equal footing, who are submitting themselves to the French people's judgement, the only one that matters
You may allow me, then, to call you Mr
Mitterrand
François Mitterand: And you are absolutely correct, Prime Minister
Here's the [video] cause the delivery and facial expressions are everything
« Casse toi pauvre con » (fuck off you twat) was said by Nicolas Sarkozy when he was President to a man who refused to shake his hand and who said to him « Oh no don’t touch me, you dirty me »
so iconic
Felix Faure, french president in 1899, died while engaged in sexual activities in his office with his mistress
He had a fatal seizure while she was fellating him
George Clémenceau's epitaph of Faure was "Il voulait être César, il ne fut que Pompée" (wordplay in French; could mean both "he wished to be Caesar, but ended up as Pompey", or "he wished to be Caesar and ended up being blown": the verb "pomper" in French is also slang for performing oral sex)
The press gave the mistress the nickname "la pompe funèbre" (wordplay in French: "pompes funèbres" means "death care business" but could also be translated, literally, as "funeral pump".
But why would pornography  help  against sea-sickness  in the  first  place ?
>Well, the truth is that something really remarkable has happened to me, that I have written it here and I do not understand my handwriting
I'm reassured that I have the same issues as someone who used to lead an entire country
We have  something  similar  from de Gaulle "the french are veals
Who  was the unlucky  midget ?
Yes sorry  phone  correcting
Interesting  To know  but now  i wonder if  sailors do this often
Not good unfortunately
I think it's because we mostly associate them with Gypsies and people are really not fond of Gypsies
When I left for a summer job in the UK a few years ago, I told my parents that there would be Romanians and Bulgarians there and my parents told "Be careful that romanians don't steal your stuff, keep it locked".
It's too bad tho, everyone at this job was super nice and I never had any problem with romanians working there, they even taught me a few words like "la multi ani" or "multumesc"
This thread summarized :
"People being racist toward Gypsies but trying to act like gentlemen by apologizing (not for being racist but)  for confusing Romanians with Gypsies"
Fair enough, I don't think Romania think a lot about Aruba neither
Yes for french people I think it depend of where you're from
Northen people and north east people would probably feel more connected to german, england, belgium etc
in term of culture or food while the south of france would be more connected to mediteranean culture
For exemple, we often resum with: north of france cook with butter, south of france cook with olive oil
I think the celtic roots are present, even if we can feel different kind of celtic rootS from a region to another
Many people often think celtic roots are only for Ireland, scottland, brittany etc
while they are also for spain, portugal and even eastern countries
I am from Southern France and I feel closer, culture wise, to my fellow Italians and Spanish neighbours, than from my fellow Northern France nationals
Of course my popular cultural references are French in terms of tv shows, music, movies, but deeper aspects like the relation to family, social rules, and so on, I feel a greater connection with the Mediterranean culture than the one of Northern France
We should totally embrace our Latinity but our government keep being pro German (which is not a prb) and keep bad relation with Italian, so fck
I grew up in south-western France and I totally felt comfortable when I visited Spain and Italy, like there are some differences but there’s also a sense of familiarity when I looked at the way people behave with each other, much more so than when I visited other parts of France like Brittany or Lille, I guess it’s more a continuum rather than just speaking a related language
But it’s funny how after a few days in Italy you start to get the gist of what people are talking about, once you get the pattern of differences between Italian and French
Kinda off topic but on most of these posts I have to scroll down to find the responses from other French people
Now this one is filled with them
Where did you guys come out from lol
I wanted to say "same in France" and then I remembered our history with Morocco and I was like "oups
I genuinely feel closer to the Southern Europe and Northern Africa mentality than I do to Northern France or Europe
What I mean is : taking time to do your business right, socializing a lot, letting out emotions whether they're good or bad and making your voice heard (aka being loud ahah)
And of course olive oil
Cooking with butter is a heresy to me, except for dishes that specifically need it
I'm from Lyon and culturally we're close to Italy (when you forget about recent culture
If you include recent culture then it's probably the americans and I think it's the same for most countries on this planet
" Southerners mock us because of the fog and the rain " Same here and I'm not even from the north (I'm from lyon)
They are always like "we have the sun and cicada sounds, we don't have any cloud and it's warm" like it's heaven and I'm alway like "do you realise that not everyone like this
" they always think we are jalous while I hate heat, sun and dry landscapes
Vrai ça.
I'm the opposite on all points haha
As a guy from Brittany, not using butter is an heresy !
Yes Lyon has a lot of Renaissance type architecture in the older parts of the city, it feels italian
On the Presque-île and the other side of the Rhône it's mostly typical Lyon architecture and Paris Hausmann like architecture without the zinc roof tiles
I would say we are influenced a lot by the americans
The difference of life before and after WW2 is immense
We have huge malls, we wear jeans, american brands we eat american snacks
Fast food are extremely popular, we speak more and more english, we adopted consumerism, our most popular music is rap, we listen a lot to their music and we watch american movies
Basically the life in the US and in Europe is the same with slight changes
That's why I also think it's the same in all of Europe
Same, my definition of happiness is heavy rain sound (bonus if a bit of thunder), fog, good book or movie like lord of the ring, fireplace, tea or hot chocolate and no visitors
Then I'm a happy woman ;)
I'm from Southern France and let me tell you living in Paris is really hard during the winter because of the lack of sunlight (compared to where I'm from)
It would be the same in France because the government passed a law and like 40% or 60% of the music has to be french
Nobody wanted to listen to french music
Radios started playing french rap
That's how it became so popular
But what I mean is culturally, rap, french, english or chinese rap, still is american culture
well I live in Paris so
but I would say my favorites are Le Louvre, Notre-Dame, Place Vendôme, l’Obélisque and le Sacré-Coeur
I would love them even more if there were not ALL OF THESE TOURISTS but I guess we’re used to them
edit: oh and I forgot about les Arènes de Lutèce (Lutèce is the ancient name of Paris) ! it’s not the most famous place in Paris but it’s quite unusual
it’s a gallo-roman amphitheater
In my city of Grenoble there’s the apartment of Stendhal
We have our pride in knowing that he was born here
Probably not of much importance to anybody who isn’t french but hey :)
Well, next to my father's (and grandma) birth place is a rock known as the Mont-Saint-Michel, a glorified sand castle, you've heard of it i suppose
And where i spent half my life growing up, Saint-Malo, some [corsair] and [nazi] mixed shit
Real stuff for zombie apocalypse in both cases
I live in Rochefort, were the king Louis XIV was building all the french battleships
In Clermont-Ferrand, France is the place where Pope Urban II called for the first crusade
I’m from Aix-en-Provence France, and we have this huge corridor like street with little fountains on it and it ends at the end with a huge fountain with a circular road around it
It’s called the Cours Mirabeau makes after the famous French revolutionary that lived there
I live in a village of 250 souls, so my church
That's Charles Martel with one single l btw
And it comes from Old French *martel*, which is *marteau* today
Worth noting that the modern French word for hammer is marteau (pronounced mart-o), martel is the Old French word, which you still have in the verb marteler
Molotok in Russian
Hungarian ending for plural is also -k, is that why you're so close friends
Yes, we still have the verb marteler => to hit repeatedly
Also use for exemple to say "il m'a materlé de question"  =  he "hit" me repeatedly with questions: he asked me lots of questions again and again without letting be rest
Így van az égesz nyelv
Question**s** :)
He was literally French
And also molotochek (молоточек)
We use frapper in most case, marteler is in very specific situation, like the exemple I used
You can say "frapper au mateau" too
Maillet still exists in modern french
Probably related to the French word "maillet".
Franks are our ancestors dude
I'm Lorrain I know what I'm talking about
Well, I'm in an intership right now, so not so much (800€ EUR/month)
But my friends (25y) earn around 2000 EUR/month after tax in Paris
> earn 3000€ bruto (don't remember netto, maybe 1900€), save some 1000€ after paying living expenses
You just withdraw 25% from brut to net
So it is more likely to be 2500 if it was 3000 brut
Human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria
Heads would roll, blood would paint the streets, the dawn of the sixth republic
All the northerners would liquefy because of the heat, all the southerners would freeze to death
Honestly it would just be july/august as usual
But we're all already confused with Estonian
I'm not even sure we'd notice a difference
>the southerners would freeze to death I guess ?
We'll find any possible way (car, train, bus, plane, on foot
) to return to the south
But we'd grab food all over the place on the way back down
No reason not to !
A friend from latvia once told me about this, how they really dislike russian presence in their country that persists today, it seems like they have a very negative way of seeing that period
It's gross and used to be very common in France
Thankfully it was made illegal to pee in urban areas
You can get a fine of 68€ if you get caught
It’s fucking gross
I did it on occasion but always super drunk, always out of sight and always in bushes or in a river (so it does not stink up the place)
I still am not proud of it
Timidly clicked the NSFW topic wondering what the question is and how much trouble I’m gonna get in being on the work network
phew, I work in the urology department
Same in France but when it happens it's no big deal for anyone
I’ve only had this experience in some metro stations
Anywhere in the city, except in designated areas
Yeah, they clearly have not haha
I like them more mushy
I don't care about how Italians cook their pasta or what's supposed to be « the right way ». I'm French, I cook French and I like them soft
Oh you know my flatmate ? I kept telling him but he answered "let me make my own mistakes", it's been 5 years now, he even claimed a "pilaf rice" recipe excuse to do that heresy
And the trick for ultra perfect pasta is to have some spaghetti available
You put one in the pot to check the amount of salt
This way you don't need a fork to check
If you just write a "Yes
" to a simple question, automod deletes your comment for being too short
Non-Reddit reader : Paris is a bit dirty and messy
Reddit reader : Paris isn't real-world Mad Max
Paris is kinda ugly
They wear helmets now
Apparently, great uncle of mine had his skull fractured during a hurling match and died a few days later
Stoplights before roundabouts are a must have in high density areas
In Paris we got a lot of them and they're necessary, if you didn't have them the roundabout would pretty much be stuck
In that case the roundabout's goal is to be a intersection of 5+ roads
Do you not usually put your seatbelt on ?
Our spelling is as weird, or even weirder than english, but I've never heard of competitions like that in french
There was a reading competition in my school once but that's basically all
Maybe we don't like competitions, I don't know ?
French also have this "problem" of words or sounds you can write many ways or silent letters
You can write [o], *o*, *ô*, *au* or *eau* for instance
There's Spelling Bee in France, for instance *"Les timbrés de l'orthographe"* organized by the ministry of education, but I don't think it's as popular as Spelling Bee is in the US
I heard a lot, it's practically in every movies/tv show that's about a family with an elementary kid
Like if every "good kids without confidence or friends or good physic" in movies had win a spelling bee competition to prove they worse something
And no, it's not a something we have
It look a bit weird actually, not that fun
There is a writing competition though (Dictée Voltaire)
I remember seeing one on TV a long time ago (Girl lost on "agrafe", she spelled it "agraphe"), but I was a young kid so maybe it was just a movie
Can't tell for sure
We definitely have spelling bees at school level, I remember doing one at some point, but it's not the big spectacle that the American ones are
Many if these words are French so the obscure is kinda hard lost from my point of view, but if it's the same feelings For English speakers as when I see the German words I can understand it
Dictées Pivot too
I reached the final of my département when I was a kid
isn't it the projet voltaire
Also, it's more an exam and a reminder on how to write in french rather than a competition IIRC
You don't get anything but a certificate that you know the spelling rules
It depends on where you're from, I guess
Where I live, it's pronounced the same way
As other said it really depends where you come from, for instance [*rose*] doesn't sound the same everywhere in France, you can hear \ʁoz\ or \ʁɔz\
*ô* is always pronounced \o\ (I don't have a counter-example in mind), *o* is often pronounced \ɔ\ but you'll have example where it's pronounced \o\ like in *fosse*, *chose* or *prose*
*au* and *eau* are also pronounced \o\, some same story as between *ô* and *o*
o, au and eau definitely sound the same in many regions
ô might be different in the east of France because they go heavy on ^ accent (on top of adding them everywhere)
In French we'd make grammar competitions
Yeah
I went up to national half final when i was a kid
Yes, Pivot, not Voltaire !
There is the projet Voltaire, which is a bit like the French TOEIC, but there is also an event where dozens of students gather in a huge room to write a text a guy reads in a microphone
IIRC it’s part of the projet Voltaire
I’ve done it
Never received anything
Oh, I didn't knew about that
There's the infamous dictée of Prosper Mérimée where every word is a trap
Easy, everyone vote for his candidate, and the 2 best at the first round (if nobody got 50% or more already) go into a final round, where everyone has to vote again, but only between those two this time
And everyone are equal in term of voice
One vote = one vote
We vote directly for them
If no candidate has more than 50% of vote (it never happen), but best scored candidate compete a few days later
We vote directly for one of them
If you wants to vote but don't like any candidate you can just vote "white", but they don't count the white votes to know how many they were so it's useless
It's the least kingly king though
He's more like your friendly uncle who's gonna hand you a cold one while he grills a few sausages during a summer bbq, and will watch football of the couch while nursing a hangover with doritos
And every sensible country yeah
The US voting system is so complicated it seems, why do you elect someone to vote in your place
That seems really weird and outdated
We also often say "you vote for the person you want on the first round but against the person you don't want on the second"
This exactly
States usually have a "head of state" and a "head of government". Thé head of state's role is to guarantee a continuity of power (as soon as the king dies, his heir instantly becomes the new one
Same with presidents during an inauguration type ceremony
The head of government is the one with proper power and who decides of the country's policies
This role Can be vacant (looking at you belgium)
If so is thé case you still have someone at the head of the country
It's funny, in France we have the same system but I have never seen case 1 in my lifetime !
I mean, that’s the way the French president was elected for quite some times, even under the 5th Republic
True, but I mean, Prins Pils
Beatrix didn't seem _that_ down-to-earth to me
You're a bit right, the fifth republic was made around the person of De Gaulle, he want a powerful leader and he believed in a strong head of state
The idea at the time was that the president should be detached from partisan politics to do their job
Meaning that while a president can _come from_ a party, they should not be _of_ a party
There is also the fact that we have a two-round election: people vote "with their heart" on round one, meaning that they vote for whoever convinced them among the numerous candidates (there were 9 in 2017, I believe
), but round two usually is an "elimination" round: people vote for whoever they dislike less
Meaning that even if a candidate were to form a kind of cult like Trump did, they would likely not pass round two (because during round two the votes are redistributed)
Of course this principle has its limits, and not everybody acts as De Gaulle did when he was a president, but that’s what he had in mind
Our system is kinda complicated because we elect the president directly and then we elect députies for the assemblée nationale
The majority party usually ends up being the president's. He then chooses a prime minister with whom he forms the government
The national assembly Can overthrow the government and the president can dissolve the assembly
So it's like a regular parliamentary system except that the executive branch is divided between the president and the prime minister
Effectively, the president has more power even though the constitution isn't explicit about it
Trump is a big reason to change it
Haha I like it, I enjoy [this one too]
>overly talkative people
So, like, they say "hi" to their neighbors ?
>Bavaria
> \- Gods holy land and a nation made of the direct descendents of Jesus and his royal highness King Ludwig themselves
They are of majestic beauty, speaking in sacred tongues only understood by those God deemed worthy
Generous, intelligent (just bc you don't speak our sacred tongue does not mean it's not smart things that we have to say) and hard-working
Everybody loves us in all of Germany and all over the world
It's true
We have the best beer and the best food, at the very latest since we acquired a new Franconia that now graces our large inventory of smaller countries that sometimes try to defy our warm godly embrace but in the end know that their place is by our side and thus by the side of all that is right and good in this world
This is where God and everyone else in Germany comes to dine and for vacation and spends abnormous amounts to have a small piece of our country
And then we are unkind and condescending to them bc that is what the Lord told us to do
Amen
All the reasons I chose to move there <3
Ostrava it is, then
FOR THE EMPEROR
The home turf of socialist leader Ségolène Royale (known as "Ségo")
She's the enlightened genius that executed the solar highway experiment despite countless engineers showing why it is a terrible idea
Imagine a chunk of the country managed by that person : Segoland
Vendée was royalist during the French revolution
As punishment a big part of the population was massacred
Since then they've historically been generally against the Republic and are pushing to have the events of the revolution recognized as a genocide
You grow up in a rust belt area from a family of people with gone jobs like mining or lo-tech manufacturing
You think socialist policies are great, but them (perceived as) foreigners stealing our jobs and (perception of) by-passing your struggle makes you very unhappy
Your other answer to that question was better
Ha, in France, there's the same stereotype about people in Normandy
Even better, I'm a Cogboy at ~~heart~~ mechanical blood-pump
Yes, that works with right-wing too
Our nationalist party, FN, is kinda schizophrenic like that, it's labelled extreme right, but some of their propositions are socialist policies
Praise, brother
Doesn't feel all that special when it's been around your entire life
When I was younger I lived in the north of France and had a couple of friends in Brussels and we often went there to see our mates and have fun as they had excellent beers compared to French bars at the time
It was only a two hours drive so it was easy
I lived in Nice & french riviera from 0 to 20 so you can imagine how often we went to Italy as it's literally \~30min to the border, it was a very common destination (Monaco too, as a country)
&#x200B;
Since I'm in Paris now it's kinda the same thing with Benelux & northen germany (albeit a bit more long)
&#x200B;
Edit : and might I add it was quite a natural thing too, if you're alreay in car u say why not hop in by italy and you just do it without thinking about it, it's just the next stop on the highway, no hassles
It's amazing and really cheap ! I'm only 21 but I've visited almost all countries in Europe
Whether it is by train, by plane, car or even bus it's so easy to travel
I did a euro trip with interflix where I went to Prague, Budapest, Split, Zagreb and Venezia, I paid 100€ for the transport and slept in the bus for half the nights
one of my favorite trips, really cheap and had an amazing time !
I live in the most Western region in France, so basically unless I'm willing to go to the British Isles which is a long trip on it's own - by european standards -  I'm doomed to hop a plane or to cross my entire country for the nth time
This is however another story for anybody living in the South western France, French Riviera, near the Swiss or German border, and let's say all the way up to Lille, near the Benelux indeed
We went to Greece in the middle school once
That was a great experience
Did school trips in Italy (one in Rome & one in Firenze), Belgium, Luxembourg, and England
That’s a really cool thing about the EU
I went to Roma with my class in 10th grade and it was amazing :)
Same thinking
Yeah it allowed me to have out of country school trip (Spain twice or thrice, Italia, Germany) but even that, for a school trip it's more about the trip than the destination
Outside of that, don't really care
Also note that this is the first neutral (not positive) comment I spot and we are both French, so maybe it's just good old French pessimism
Damn, were you in public school
I heard they do more school trip since the government help financially
I was in private school
The only school trip I got in my entire scolarity is 5 days in a Carmel without religious women, helping them the garden, as a religious retreat to "think about ourself".  3 weeks before the bac exam -\_- . Of course, no cellphone
You just made me remember a PTSD when I was waiting for my plane to Ireland and they specifically asked for passports
I was chatting with my sister during that time, " eh could you check for me if Ireland is in the Schengen Area ? No ? ... Well, too bad ".
They had me for 30minutes until there was a small way for European Union residents *who happened to travel just with their ID* \- like any Schengen Area country, they just decided to make their own policy, and they had me on that
Could be french pessimism but I don't think so, I'm just not someone that is very into traveling so being close to other countries doesn't really do anything to me
I guess it'll be nice if one day I want to travel
I’m real glad we sorted the phone thing on a European level
Much more practical this way
I was in a private school, and then a private classe prépa actually :)
I also did the spiritual retirement thing, but luckily nobody expected us to help the religious women & men (yep, I did it thrice -women, men, men)
I think you don't have to live close to borders to see giant swarms of Spaniards and any other Europeans diving in a small country
Just my two cents
Thanks for clarifying ! No worries, it makes sense
At the end of the day it was my fault not to double-check this kind of thing, I took it for granted in a way
Me neither, but that's because nobody care on visiting my region, except the Brits
The Brits are everywhere anyway
Ici c'est les néerlandais plutôt
Tu es des Hauts-de-France ? =)
Non de Lorraine pourquoi
Je connais pas forcément ce coin, c'est vraiment à l'autre bout de chez moi, je pensais tout naturellement que y aurait plus de Néerlandais vers Lille, cela étant en Lorraine ça marche tout aussi bien
Ah mais ils sont partout
What’s an object from your daily life which you think is uncommon in other countries
My cancoillote
Even in my own country you can only find it mainly in my region
It is a local cheese
You can spread it on bread
Also, it smells actually good
I swear
And I don't say this like "camember smells good" because a camambert compared to another can smell better or smell "good" like "I can tell this cheese is good by the scent", no, it ACTUALLY smells nice
A knife for [cheese] but this has more to do with me loving cheese than me being French I think
Also, this type of tissue [bag] to carry your baguette when you buy it at the boulangerie/bakery
That sounds really great
I was expecting to see the briki, which also comes with the 2-in-1 mini stove oven with a dedicated briki burner ^^
I just googled them and the designs look so cute
I'm going to swamp you with a third comment on those boots, but it's gotten me thinking; I own a vintage Dale of Norway sweater from my mom and it's one of my favorite pieces of clothing
I don't think I'd need boots like yours, but are there other brands or types of Norwegian clothing and outerwear which you'd recommend, which are also that type of traditional thing
I just love the style so much
Oh I love these
How do they fair at the end of the season when the snow begins to melt
Is there anything you need to do to preserve them for next year or can you just dry them off inside and store them for next time
I haven’t seen a can opener like that since, quite literally, visiting a WWI museum haha
I’m very interested in that toaster
I assume to toast aslice of bread you’d need to turn it over
Are there other types of can openers
Also, toasting rolls & buns sounds like genius
Does it look different from a normal rifle
Does it have an insignia on it like a Swiss knife
Super common in France
Wow that’s impressive
I’ve seen beer glass collections in bars in the past, but tbh I always assumed it was something the beers brand did as a gimmick and to make money
Does this mean that the boot glass is actually a thing
I always kind of assumed it was a tourists’ gimmick
I have one that I love
Granted, it’s from an Italian brand :)
I remember noticing that
It’s not very convenient
A birthday calendar in the toilets
That's the most Dutch thing
They exist in France as well but are not used every day I think
I’ve never really seen them in normal life but they’re ubiquitous in all the hospitals I’ve worked at for giving bed baths
Where I live in Bavaria, the same thing exists for [spätzle]
Not to be intentionally dense but why are your sinks in such need of scraping
Cancoillotte
Oooh, I’ve not though of those in years
So useful, I miss owning one
Thanks for the reminder, I’m gonna buy one now
Is that just your preference or is it pretty ubiquitous to Swiss homes
I keep seeing it in the store and I’ve been curious to try it but don’t really know how to use it
Italy has those too
Something that almost all of my Muslim friends in the UK have and getting more common in Muslim French households which are turning away from having a separate bidet
That’s adorable
It reminds me of Thomas the Tank engine
Nice cheese knife
I know some people who have them in Germany as well
Just googled welshcakes, they look delicious
I’ve seen this in Italy too
I’m surprised it’s a thing in two countries which are so far apart
That looks super convenient
What dishes do you use it for
I know this as the tool to make mashed potatoes with
This isn’t mandatory in places that I’ve lived in to the extent of my knowledge
Is the point to be visible to traffic
Bidet used to mean pony, it’s very archaic though
Now bidet just means, well, bidet
I’ve never been to à European country where teabags weren’t a thing :)
Oh hey, are you Muslim
All my Muslim friends in the UK have a shower bidet now and I’m so glad that the demand from their communities is making it so much more common because I miss washing my butt properly haha
Oh I know the porro thing
Ended up drunk a couple time because of it in a bodega in Nantes
Bidet in French means bidet, lol
For lots of my Arabic friends, they mostly have a shower head plumbed into the toilet to use rather than a separate bidet
It’s mandatory in Muslim households to wash properly with water after a Number 2 so even in countries where it’s really uncommon to have a bidet (like the UK), there’s essentially a watering can by the toilet to allow for proper washing
True immersion was a discovery for me in Ireland
I did see the same thing once in Israel, but it was so warm that having less warm water was less of a big deal
Wait, is it not
I thought it was to review your stool
My Norwegian friend sent me one as a gift, we honestly had no idea what to do with it and nearly took our fingers off trying to work it out
She came to stay and made it look so simple that it was kind of embarrassing
I keep stationary items in mine, it's convenient
Oh mon dieu ! Une soeur qui me comprend !
The split is to pick up the pieces of cheese
If I may ask, you say they’re not waterproof, but they still do well in snow
Same, I should move to the mountains just to be able to wear those
Ah thank you so much
And what about lighter clothing
Is there a way to find embroidered dresses or something of that sort
Oh that is also very pretty
Thanks for the tip :D how do you call that type of traditional patterns, does it have a name
Mostly they come with a pull ring
Admittedly it’s not fool-proof and sometimes pops off or the can doesn’t have one so I’ve always had a double wheeled one like this:
I see, that is convenient indeed
That’s pretty cool actually, thanks for sharing :D
I still think the mixer is a superior option, but tbh if you wanted that you could buy this [thing] which mixes the two water flows for you
Ahh, so there is actually a reason
Thanks for explaining :)
Well there's that, but I heard it's also to prevent any [Poseidon's kiss]
Can be one or the other in my experience, I prefer the shower one because you don’t have to move
Thanks for the tip
No I mean I saw a drier shelf exactly like the one you linked, above the sink
I ought to try and make pulled pork
Each time I think it's just going to take too long, and I'll end up with a lot of meat, but I guess I could freeze some of it
Yaay I am most honored
What Dutch treat do I get
That sounds good, thanks for the idea :)
Interesting
I did wear these as a kid but it was a safety thing and not mandatory
They are found in most people's homes in Germany for instance
Oh boy, I’m howling hahaha
Apparently it did mean that a few centuries ago, you weren’t too far off, but we now say poney for a pony
I see
I guess when it’s that cold, the snow really doesn’t melt for most of the season
Thanks for explaining
Thanks
I’ll look into it, maybe I could knit or embroider some myself :)
I know right
They should advertise more
We need a wider sample size
But I already own [this version
That’s not nice :(
All of this is so cute, I really want one now
Honestly I’m pretty sure I saw all three of those, as I stayed in multiple Airbnb’s during my last trip
But maybe I just got lucky
But I like it :( and it works
It was always a shared apartment where the people also lived and one room was an Airbnb
But I only saw it once I think, so probably just an anomaly
I have no idea what is a Hermitcraftlike server ? Care to introduce me to it ? c:
Thank you
So it just means survival
Thought it could be more than that darn
Clean streets (but it got better), no grafitti/tags on buildings, more public toilets
Returnable bottles and cans
In Sweden (and I believe Germany and probably many more places too) when you buy something in a plastic bottle or can, you receipt will show 1 or 2 additional kronor (10 or 20 euro cents), and there are spots in every large supermarket where you can submit these empty bottles to get that money back, and the bottles are sent back to the initial seller, I believe
Plastic bottles are such a large part of the trash over here, it would be be able to return them instead of throwing them all away
\- More drive thru in cities: it's a nightmare is you're driving and near a bakery/other shop, just need one thing but can't park
Many just park in the middle of the road wich make trafic worse
\- shop open 24h/24h or at least not close during lunch break
\- "wilde" campside: here it's forbidden to camp where you want and camp site doesn't feel the same than in the USA for exemple: here you're definitly not as mure in nature
\- more foreign restaurants, especially affordable one
\- more sport and art at school and scool club/dances, selling etc
and other "fun" things
\- free public toilets, ande MORE public toilets
I need to use the restroom often and I really often have to go backhome earlier or to by someting in a café to use the bathroom
\- Cheap street food
We only have the same few sandwiches, ice cream in summer and crêpe/waffle
Hazelnut Yoplait yoghurt and apple Fanta
I discovered these in Ireland and they were never sold in France although Yoplait is a French brand
We have bidets in houses but people put laundry in them and most people don't even know what their purpose are
> Dublin's safe feeling in the city center
In Athens sometimes you feel you have walked into Karachi or Mogadishu at night if you walk alone in some areas
Where/when did you live in Dublin
Things have gotten significantly worse the last couple of years, especially northside
There is a big contrast between southern Europe and northern when it comes to cooking:
No technicly it's forbidden and called "wild/savage camping", a few decade ago i was sill possible but not now
Same with campervan, even if you find a nice spot in the middle of nowhere, police would probably come in the night to ask you to live in the minute
So you can try but it's better to do it very discretly and hope the forest owner won't see you and be a jerk
Yes I thought about iand it is not compatible with my job and often with my health
If I can I use my bike, if not public transport, but I still often have to use my car
It's also a matter of tourism and overusage
Sweden is huge, not as dense, but mostly not attracting as much tourism as the various regions of France where you'd want to camp
I'm saying as someone who can't wait to go back to Sweden to enjoy it, though
For many places, you are right
Where I live however, it is too mountainous
There is a 400m altitude difference between my home and my work place
Exactly, here their is not much spare land (most "spare land" have private owners), and even in places like in mountains area you can only walk a few of hours without seeing a way
And only about like a couple of hour maybe, without seeing a fence, a farm, a sign, a refuge etc etc
And every "nice spot" like when there is a nice view, near a river with relativly easy access, a glade etc
a quite touristic: you can't camp there diescretly and you won't be alone for long
So you would have to camp completly in the forest, not even in a glade and that's not really practicle for most people, no view, etc and making a fire would be dangerous and illegal if it's not your forest since most forest are quite dry (the northen part of the country don't have most forest and most of then are too small for a walk that need a a night camp)
Living in an old city:
Roads are made for horses and carts, not for modern cars
Trafic: horrible, parking slots: scarse
Public transportation is vital
Buildings are not easily accessible to the disabled, they are "retrofitted" to get elevators, electricity
A/C... which may lead to strange setups
In France for instance, elevators were usually installed in the middle space left by the stairwell
This leads to tiny elevators, fitting like 2 people
You have tons of historical preservation rules that make upgradings of buildings more difficult and more expensive
As soon as you dig, you find historical stuff
Public works take ages because of that
I have lived in a 17th century building in the heart of Paris
Not a single wall was straight, and the floor wasn't that even either
5 floors no elevator building (no space to retrofit an elevator)
Plumbing was probably outdated, but electricity was relatively recently redone
I love my city, but it did have a big renovation job done in the 19th century, so most of its architecture/organization is not that old
Paris
The nightmare of drivers when we still had cd players in cars
Can't speak for everyone, but here we got our loads of WW2 bombs / mines but nothing older than 1950s to testify how does it feel to live in a old civilian building
What is even ironic here is the buildings the Allies tried to destroy are still in place, without a single scratch, like nothing happened
Not the fairest deal of the century you could argue
A big chunk of Paris is from the 1900-1920 period and is considered historic
It’s just that most of the buildings look pretty similar to Hausmanian ones so people just assume everything is Hausmanian
All the time
People here vote "against" someone way more often than "for" someone
In each election since it's a two rounds system and therefore in the first round you vote for the one you want in charge and in the second one, as there are 2 remaining candidates, against the one you don't want at all ruling
Wasn’t there actually something about Orbán being one of the only European leaders that do accept the number of immigrants the EU asks them to take in
Not sure at all, but I believe I remember hearing that in geography class (the teacher said it was a shame/shameful France was not doing its part)
You think most of America is significantly left of Biden
In what way were people "forced" to vote Biden in the primary
Ok, but that sounds like people don't think America is left enough to vote Sanders, not that anyone was forced to do anything
They may be wrong, but I'm not sure there's evidence of the contrary
Given the covid I would say la bise, let's see how it goes after the immunity
Mardi gras
Going out in the street in disguises, eating very fat food
I live in brittany, the french government has tried its best to crush local languages and cultures for centuries now and not much has been done to save anything that disrupts cultural unity
Its really sad
Breton music, festivals, songs, food are slowly dissapearing, becoming either clichés or just vanishing
Wait, Jesus used to do the deliveries to Portugal himself
without subcontracting to one of the two weird bearded men who had cornered the European market
I was always surprised how little Germans sing in random occasions or between friends , during the years I have lived there
Definitely much less than in France
Traditional music and dance is still quite alive in France, with some big festivals, but not very popular either
There was a big collection effort in the last decades to preserve old dances and songs from old people, so that they don't completely disappear
Also, in Lyon we used to put candle on December 8 for Mary, the fête des lumières, but I fear the big touristic event may kill the tradition
How is this not child labor
It might be why this tradition is disappearing
Is it though
You can still see the chalk inscriptions on doors everywhere
When the roads are [like this] we slow down and go on the sides as much as possible and it's usually good enough for both cars to cross
In the North it's ok
In some parts of the South (mainly the Alps and the Riviera) and Parisians when they come to the countryside, they drive ABOVE the speed limit (frequently seen people driving faster than 100 km/h in small mountain roads)
These usually have an 80km/h speed limit around here, though most people wouldn't go that fast obviously
If visibility's good, i'll usually go 60 or 70, when there are turns that block sight, i'll stick to 40-50, rarely less than that (i probably would if I knew encountering another driver on that road was common, but I haven't been in that situation yet)
I just pray everytime a truck is coming in my direction
I'd say "Non, je ne regrette rien" from Edith Piaf for France
Anything from Gainsbourg represents the french spirit quite well, according to me
&#x200B;
And then, there's this one : [
I would say "Aux Champs Elysées" by Joe Dassin is the song which is the most associated with France, but it doesn't really represent France
The non-official anthem still remains Le Chant des Partisans
Edith Piaf's song, besides their popularity, don't really have a national pride ring to them
I don't like Paris but ''Aux Champs Elysees'' is known worldwide and talks about a famous French avenue
The lacs du Connemara
C’est marrant je l’ai jamais écoutée
The opening of Grieg's Piano Concerto would be nice too
At least it would startle the opposing team in international sports games
I was always told that "Don't look back in anger" by Oasis was the unofficial anthem of the UK
I mean, if you are French speaking, you're going to associate a lot of old French songs to France I think
This is my answer too
True, and I do agree, but I doubt the far right would feel too happy about a communist song representing the country
Also I went for what must probably be most known French song internationally that I know of
Je sais, mais je pense que la chanson d'Edith est plus connue
Seulement si t'es étudiant et bourré !
As a French: yesssss, the anthem of my student days
Living in the UK: people only know Edith Piaf :(
It's a lullaby
Is it really a French music though (I genuinely have no idea) ? Because a lot of lullabies that we hear are usually translated in another language and that's it
Perso je la déteste mais c'est une musique super connue à l'Internationale
Écoute plutôt la foule de Piaf, c'est une chanson fabuleuse
Jamais été convaincu ni par la vie en rose, ni par je ne regrette rien, mais peut-être en réécoutant un jour
Edit: j'ai réécouté et c'est super je ne regrette rien, mais pas sa meilleure
As a traditional anthem, I feel like Jerusalem would be the most obvious choice
Malheureusement certains restent adulescents trop longtemps (collègues traumatiques)
I know it's hard for an Irish to acknowledge, but the Scottish anthem is by far the best in the Six Nations
Even if you're not Scottish you just want to send the English home
Well Today I Learned then, I would have expected you guys to have a translated version
Took us 1 year with that new squad
The Paris region in France is called Île de France
It translates to Isle of France
It's smack in the middle of the mainland
Kind of a well-known fact, but the oldest bridge in Paris is called the "Pont-Neuf" which means "New bridge"
Le Marais (the Marsh) in Paris is a very posh and very touristic gay and jewish neighborhood, right in the middle of the city
[Châteaudun] means "castle castle", as "dun" is celtic for a fortified place and "château" meant any fortified place during the MA
Departments of France are usually named after rivers or mountains
In South of France there is the [Var department] named after the river Var, wich flows in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Alpes-Maritimes departments (1OO km west of the Var department)
It dates back change of territory in the department century ago, but they never updated the name
The city Lyon, France, is definitely not a lion
Les Landes,  in the southwest of France, means moorland, because it used to be a desolated flatland and a marsh
But Napoleon the third dried the land by planting trees, making it one of the biggest forest in Europe
The name stayed though
Are you sure
According to wikipedia it says that Wales comes from the germanic Wahl which means "who speaks a celtic or roman language / langue Gallo-romaine" or "who doesn't speak a germanic language". It says that it was wrongly considered to mean foreigner when, in fact, it's a linguistic term
In latin languages the W became a G and Wales is then (Pays de) Galles in French
It has the same origin as Gaulish
In the case of Wallonia (the french speaking part of Belgium) the W was conserved but it has the same linguistic origin
It has no common origin with Gaelic tho, despite sounding the them
And I've looked it up a bit and it has also the same origin as, for example, Wallachia (Romania) and even Walnut is from it (Wales Nuts)
It's meaning is closer to "who speak a non-germanic language" than to foreigner, even tho it's understandable that the confusion was made, especially in Great Britain following the saxon invasion, the Welsh were, for the saxon, the non-germanic speakers
And in Belgium, the Wallons, are again, according to the Dutch and Flemish, the "non-germanic speakers" as they were speaking French
Let's all non-germanic of Europe Unite and call ourselves Welsh
Another in France: the oldest bridge in Paris is named Pont-Neuf ("New bridge")
"Come and try our newest bridge in town" "wow such bridgy - very pathway"
But which is Northampton North of Southampton
I've seen two interpretations:
- it's because it's almost surrounded by three rivers
- it's derived from old Frankish *Liddle Franke*, which meant little France
(Unlikely since Frankish became extinct long before the name *Île de France* appeared, in the late 14th century)
I always considered it to mean something like "the Crown Land". And remember that names come from a time when Parisians were not that cliché (which they still are not IMO)
Every city with stone bridge from the middle age has one (like Toulouse)
Most of the time the "old" bridge was a wooden one who was destroyed since then
Yes, but it's a tiny island
There are bigger islands within *Ile de France*.
*Ile de France* is 4,638 sq miles, while *Ile de la Cité* (Notre Dame island) is 0
08 sq mile
You got two "main" tiny islands on the Seine, Ile Saint-Louis and Ile de la Cité (there's also l'ile aux cygnes (= swann island but never seen a swann there) on which you can find a smaller replica of the Liberty Statue)
edit: that link [
Actually yes, Notre Dame is on a island
Actually for the time this bridge was kind of a novelty because it was forbidden to build any kind of building on it (think of famous bridges in Italy with houses on it
All of Paris was like that)
The bridge was designed to get you across the river, yes, but also as a leisure area for the Parisians to stroll
Speaking just for my country, I guess it's different in others
But part of France "unification" was made by erasing regional languages and dialects
It's only in the last ~50 years that we stopped trying to get rid of these, and some are now optionally taught in school, but almost nobody talk anything else than French
Even if there are countries where this didn't happen (I was surprised the first time I heard about Catalan
) , this kind of history makes people wary
Just to give an example, the EU members don't even have the same culture about the relationship between those who are in power and those who are subjects to power
I think by now, France has a staggering reputation to go on strike or protest whenever it can, but this is the result of visioning the balance of power as a constant conflict (*rapport de force*) where each got to defend his/her own yard
But if you go to countries who were more versed into Protestanism before, this kind of attitude wouldn't be received well
Maybe a German can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I feel that in Germany, you get to distinguish and prove yourself as a leader, not because you're the most capable, you have exceptional skills or whatever, but because you proved you could rally the most people around you
And again, if you would try to import that in France, most of us would be left confused in the best case scenario
So if we'd have a European Union federation state, that kind of things would be vital to sort out, and the thing is that I don't know how one could arbitrate that fairly without creating more problems than there were before
Why do you hate you country so much that you want it to disapear as sovereign and have no longer power ?
A vote with 40 million people, you have very more power than a vote with 500 million people who have not the same political interest as you
I think there is a solution to preserve culture and language diversity, and even maybe help the come back of some dialect
A language like Esperanto, which is not linked to any country but has its own culture could stop anglicisation and ease communication, education and travelling all across Europe
Because it happened
Savoisien culture is disappearring
Independant countries can have different laws also
My region have never been a country like most of other regions of France
It have its cultural specifities but nothing that would justfiy to been split from the rest of the country but this is the french centralized state that created the most of what we have
If i go in a other region, the things will exactly the same
That's why we are part of a unified in country
It is naive to think that Europe allows us to protect ourselves from the USA or China
Poland in 2003 with EU pre-accession funds first purchased F-16s. Belgium and Italy have bought F-35s. The European Union is full of American military bases and previous American leaders have always been very pro-European with sometimes very proactive ambassadors' comments
The import tax rate is only 2
5% outside the EU, i.e. bread crumbs
Many projects paid with European funds are sometimes carried out by Chinese companies
The Chinese have no difficulty whatsoever in reaching our markets and acting negatively in Europe
The EU protecting is a joke and the Americans and the Chinese laugh when they hear that a strong EU will protect European markets
All they have to do is put pressure on one of the Member States to veto any decision that would be against their interests
About 10 years ago i started to grow my own vegs in the countryside after an accident since I found a girlfriend who grows everything (from medicinal plants to olive oil
) we learnt to respect what we eat, the meat we have is from animals we know and take like 1/4 of the animal
We are in no way "hippy" but i can understand in towns sandwiches, kebabs etc since the covid more and more people are coming here and that's a great thing and starting to appreciate the way of life eating around the table
Just saying, crappy food you don't really want to share when you have salads/tomatoes from the garden and a steak of neighbours cow you want to share with respect to what you are eating
Hoping people realise junk food is only junk food
Where are you from OP ? Just curiosityy
I may have a hard time sleeping the weeks I get up early (4AM) but I tend to have good cooked meals
We take turn cooking with my SO
Recently got a dietetician to help us planning the food thing and eat less garbage
I also wonder if OP has kids
I bet OP's parents prioritized those things, and OP will have a chance to prioritize those things once they have kids (if they have kids)
We were on the same page until the two hours evening meal
It’s usually just a ~45min thing with my family, more than that when we take the aperitif, which we do both on weekdays & during the weekend, but we don’t have one every day off/weekend at all (and it’s not only adults who drink alcohol, all the 15yo+ that want some get some, they just get less of it/don’t get strong alcohol)
Agreed with all the rest
I'm paid to work 35h per week
I'm not going to work any more than that
Plenty of time to live and do things
I agree with your description
I used to skip breakfast but i don't because i have kids now, so we eat together, fully sitted
we have 20min to eat
Lunch at work is exactly as you describe, we have a cafeteria and we take about an hour to eat and have coffee, but sometimes we take longer, with the benediction of the boss
On the other hand the dinner is much shorter, 30min, 40min, because the kids have got to go to bed not too late
But we do eat together and share stories about our days
I have so much sleep I wonder it's not too much
How can they make enough to live
We got the "love locks" plague
Tourists who only care about posting a romantic picture on Instagram are putting locks everywhere and creating metal pollution in rivers and seas when throwing the keys
I should also mention that bridge rails collapsed in Paris under the weight of hundred of locks, putting other visitors in danger
"Fête de la musique" launched in France during the 80's. It's now in many countries as "Music day" but without the joke - "Do music !" and "Celebration of music" sounds the same in French
The idea is that anyone can play music once a year without the usual restriction (pay the author, be quiet especially after 22h, have talent
It's fun, especially in large cities
La fête de la musique, a national festival created in 1982 by the initiative of one of France's ministers
Since then, a hundred countries have adopted the idea but it originally is a french idea
I don't think we have a normal/typical city because the cities in the south are so different from the ones in the north, I'd like to say Paris but 80% of the population hates it
Maybe Lyon
As for the most foreign, I'd say Saint-Denis in La Réunion (very different culture) or Cayenne in Guyane (wet equatorial climate)
I grew up in the South-West
Cities up north like Lille  feel a bit different, with all the dark brick building
Lyon felt quite different too, almost Italian
Strasbourg looks very German
I'd say Bordeaux or Grenoble has a more typical architecture
I know this is ask Europe, but as an American, Miami is easily the most foreign city I've ever been to in the US
LA, NYC, SF, Atlanta, NOLA, etc
all have something similar about them
But being in Miami is basically like being in Latin America
I grew up in north west of france (Rouen) and the city I feel is the most foreign to french culture is Strasbourg and every ski station in Alpes and Pyrénées
I'd go for Lyon as the most typical because it is actually a bit of everywhere else and there's also extremely wealthy and popular neighborhood, so it looks like an mashup version of France
As for 'foreign' all the cities at the borders have taken from their neighbours: Lille is very Belgian, Strasbourg is very German, Thonon is very Swiss, Menton is very Italian
edited for clarity
I mean
Strasbourg ? Metz ? They definitely were better choices here
Oh God I know this place very well
So weird to read about it on reddit
Then there are villages in the Basque Country being very close to their Spanish consins
I agree that Strasbourg looks "foreign" and someone else said it below but compared to oversees Régions I'd say it still looks more French
Metz looks like a pretty typical French historic city but still a lot of German influence
Strasbourg could fit, Metz is pretty typical of a French city
I found the vieux port of Marseille quite special, but the rest of the city is nothing particular
Otherwise, othersea territories are the obvious answers
I don't think Lyon looks Italian, compared to Nice or even Cannes
For example, in the South close to Italy (Menton, Nice especially), they got those special louver shutters (persienne/persiana) which can be lifted like [the one on the 2nd picture] This is very uncommon elsewhere
We even call those shutter 'a l'italienne'.
In general, the city layout in residential area are made to protect people from the sun while still getting some light, with narrower streets, mini piazzas every three blocks, white and/or yellow tones
In the north every building is grey, basically
The use of sculptures on buildings, even if it's just a head above the door is also uncommon beside king's residences and churches
That said the Italy we refer to is most often the cities next to France, so maybe those are not what you consider 'typically Italian'!
Hmmm while I agree that Metz FEELS French, the architecture of the city isn't for a good portion of it
Le Vieux Lyon est calqué sur la renaissance italienne, architecturalement, le Vieux Lyon c'est comme en Italie
Lol, I feel for you, it's the same thing with France
When I said I was French in erasmus in Italy, they kept talking about Paris and their holidays there, although I had never visited it
I would think it's worse for England though, other cities are known only for football or the Beatles
Had to google this term and lmao
No I’m not but my partner sure is
We spend most of our summers in Quarteira just next to Vilamoura so I guess I’m an avec by proxy
I love your country, it’s one of the most beautiful and welcoming places in Europe
I had exactly the same experience in Zürich airport

Esperanto
It was designed to be easy to learn, and it really is
Think about it, how much of language learning is memorizing conjugations, complicated rules and then exceptions to those rules, inconsistent spelling and pronunciations, etc
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a language that has none of those things
Well, it exists, and it’s called *Esperanto*. Estimates suggest that people could learn Esperanto five times faster than English
A neutral lingua franca would let everybody communicate on an even playing field
Right now, native anglophones have a big advantage in the world, at least in international industries
Do you want to be a scientist
Spend 5-10 years learning English first
[A 2005 study] suggested that adopting Esperanto as a lingua franca could save the EU 25 billion euros annually – not to mention that the current dominance of English contributes an estimated 17 billion to the UK economy every year
Think of all the time devoted to learning English in schools—we could learn *other* languages in that time, promoting linguistic and cultural diversity
Why is English so dominant anyways
The answer is obvious yet hard to admit for many people: the United States, and to a lesser extent, the UK
Two countries which are not in the EU
Through economic, cultural, and political/military dominance, the US has turned English into the global lingua franca, a fact which largely benefits anglophone countries
I’d rather have the EU show some cultural independence and not willingly surrender to English and American influence
Well lets think a little what kind of langage EU needs
You need a rational langage, so all southerns one are out
You need a langage pleasing to the hear so all Northern ones are out
So you end up with english and french
Now it's maybe only me, but I believe europe should be leader in quality and high standards, so I don't why we would choose the cheap version of french instead of the original
Obviously base
Reasons pro french : easy to learn for Spaniards, Italians and Romanians, gendered language like most of europeans languages and unlike english, and above all turning the EU into the ~~Third French Empire~~ the European Empire will finally make Europe politicaly relevant
Reasons against : weirdest of all the romance languages, words don't sound the way they are written, plenty of accent marks and making accidentaly a sexual innendo is very easy
Shouldn't. Because no one like us
Should
Because it used to be so it's tried and worked
Englsh is already there, we should just give up the ghost and stop slowing the process down
> Also, language nerds already love those Finno-Ugric grammar complexities and if everybody knows them, they become a lot less special
Couldn't agree more

I first thought your cat played on your keyboard
Beszéljen mindenki magyarul
Other argument: French is the language that [conveys information] the fastest
Sure, but it’s still easier than English or any other language (unless they’re like really closely related)
Simplicity and regularity go a long way
In any case, the question was about a language for Europe, not necessarily for the world
My thought exactly
We can express everything
>Are you guys taught about these things in school or was this just a happy coincidence
No I think it's more a cultural trait
The subject is easy banter
You just line up the usual supect and try to make sens out of stereotype
I mean the brit do it a lot too the only difference is that they actualy believe it
most of them still believe normand were not french but a superior race that arose out of thin air and gave birth to Churchill and Dr Who
Oh comon you have to hear sometime ! You do know the only reason Beethoven spoke German was because he was deaf
Just take Charle V advise on it :
"I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse
Now, I'm profondly invested in equal right and don't see why we should speak to women anymore in Italian, they're not as stupid as history believed them to be at the time but I sincerely don't feel like EU should rule or express herself on behalf of religion or horses
NOTE : The most perspicatious will notice the absence of english
But you got to understand, he was a wise man and well instructed and at the time patois and other créoles weren't yet considered like real langage
>Which is why you cant have a language that assigns genders to inanimate objects
On the contrary ! How else are you going to fight against patriarchal oppression and machism in langage if not by naming random thing by gender ! You can't deconstruct just to desconstruct that Nihilism
You need to construct deconstruction to deconstruct construction so that deconstruction constitute the new construct of deconstruction
I mean it's pretty basic and simple knowledge
So you either don't differentiate man and woman, or you do
and then apply it to all
that's just equality
EU is not an ancient regime under monarchie
Oh yeah, that's pretty comon worldwide, it's just bad taste but with a little education you can overcome it
In France we say: "C'est l'hôpital qui se fout de la charité" and I think it's beautiful ..
They even pretend English has more of a "latin" (meaning, from the Romans) influence instead of French, when half of their vocabulary is purely French
There's just gy and a (and maybe ty) but they're easy to master
Maybe, we don't know, we can't understand what those barbaric folks are saying
Danish no

Napoleon invading Russia is one of the biggest mistake he made
Or maybe is  nephew  attacking Prussia in 1870
- 1812
But at least it created a cool music
Or 1870
Both were pretty stupid invasions

Spain would have probably shifted towards neutrality, the loss at Trafalgar was not only a huge blow to the morale but also made it really difficult for Spain to secure trade with its American colonies, putting the country's economy in a very weak position
People showed more and more resentment towards French troops stationed in France to blockade/invade Portugal, Manuel de Godoy who was the main figure in favor for a cooperation with Napoléon was then "forced into retirement" by an angry mob in favor for the heir of the throne
Now come the dick move, Napoléon came to Spain to mediate the power struggle between the king and his heir but just went "Fuck that, I already have troops in the country, now my brother is the new king
Just try me". And that's how a friendly country that just wanted to say that they're tired of this shit and want to get out of it became a guerilla nightmare, slowly draining Napoléon limited resources
Oh god
Absolutly not
Without Napoléon and his empire France would have been crushed by the others nations
Without Napoléon France would have been destroyed, a phantom state of thé Asburg
I don't give a shit about your inferiority complex
I don't feel morally superior, only a fool would be
>Truth hits the hardest, I guess
What truth ? From an event 75 years ago, when you and I weren't even born ? We declared war on Germany, a bit late, but we did, despite our numerous casualties in WWI, and we suffered our most shameful loss, destroying our military's reputation from a short event of 5 years over a span of a millennia of history
Not really no, as a man from Savoy, that's not what i call good management
And if they 're was no risk After that why do the powers in Europe pushed for the brother of the last King to step on the throne of France ?

The sun sets around 16h30
You just get used to it
I plan my days accordingly
I like doing long walks for example, so during winter I do them around 13h so I am sure I can get as much sunlight as I can
(Those long walks help a lot !)
I live literally right on it, and the nice thing is that the summers have very long days where you can sit outside drinking beer until 10:30
I live at like 46 and I don't care, I like when it's dark more than when it's sunny
1871, after the 2nd French Empire ends, a National Assembly is elected
Monarchists are at a majority ; they want to restore the monarchy in France
So they go over to the lawful heir of the throne of France, and ask him to be the new king
He just has to say the word, they vote, and, boom, France is now a Kingdom again
Except the guy throws a tantrum : he won't accept if the tricolore (blue, white, red) flag remains
He wants the old white flag of the monarchy back
The thing is, everyone likes the tricolore flag
Even the previous king (Louis-Philippe) had choosen to keep it
But the guy is stubborn : white flag, take it or leave it, so negociations end up bogged down
Republicans then get the majority of seats in the following election, and France goes on to become a long-term republic, and (likely) never again a kingdom
&#x200B;
The kind of thing that have exactly zero valid reason to happen, and yet do happen
Dude saw the 1871 mess in Paris and came out with the lamest excuse to dodge that bullet, expecting it to happen again maybe ?
Wich is a shame because imho d'Artois would have been a good king, he had a great mindset and was aware of the new social issues brought by the industrial era
it was just a small bite
It was the same year Paris lost its collective shit and tried to become an independant city-state and turn the rest of the country into a loose federation of similar city-states
Take a wild guess about their potential reaction to the monarchy
We changed political regimes like 8 times in a century, at this point what was even supposed to be good or bad man
Yeah we got a nice demonstration of how monarchies are a healthy thing in 1914
I mean he grew up on exile after Louis-Philippe "stole" is crown, he grew up with the white flag of the Bourbon dynasty in their bagage
Also a little context : after the collapse of the First Empire, the Bourbons return in France, they are the two young brothers of Louis XVI
The first one Louis XVIII, despite being mocked for his obesity was smart and had a good political sense so while the old white flag is back he knows how to balance the legacy of the revolution and the one of the monarchy, so it's overall a peaceful period with good ministers
He dies in 1824 and the last brother, Charles X comes in charge
He is way more naive than Louis XVIII and keep the memorie of his elder brother Louis XVI being executed despite accepting compromises and whatever the revolutionnaries asked him, so he has a more authoritarian rule and refuse the legacy of the revolution
Charles X is the grandfather of Henri d'Artois
In 1830 a parisian revolt starts, Charles X knows the most popular of the Bourbons is not his son but his grandson Henri d'Artois so he gives the crown to his son, who became Louis XIX for 20 minutes, and then to Henri d'Artois
But Louis-Philippe d'Orleans who is in charge after the abdication of Charles X and was charged to organised the succession to Henri d'Artois just keep the crown for himself and starts the Monarchy of July
The Bourbons starts their exile and go in Austria then later in UK
So, when after the collapse of the IInd Empire Henri d'Artois is the last Bourbons and claim the throne, he say this famous sentence about the white flag : "I received the white flag as a sacred deposit, from the old king my grandfather
He floated on my cradle, I want him to shade my grave
I think he had a great mindset because he was slightly socialist, wanted genuinely to be close to the people and all of that while wanting a no-liberal monarchy
And when he was in Paris after the collapse of the IInd empire he declined the proposal of several generals to just march their armies into the city and put him in charge directly, he wanted no blood splitted for him whatsoever even if he cost him the crown
I was working with German collegues years ago, I had to fly to Munich every month to spend a couple of days there, so we were using the company canteen for lunch
I do not speak German at all, but well, I know a few very basic words like hello thank you goodbye, the very very basic
So well, in a canteen, you only need to say hello, mention the food you want, say thank you and that's it
The plate names were written down so here again, you know how to read german, you can name the food
No special skills here
So I ordered my food, and my colleagues then told me, hold on, you said you can't speak german
It seems my pronounciation was not too far off and I ordered in an enough natural way to fool them
I was proud of myself
Not a word but catalan speakers are always thrilled when I say a few words in their language
Sometimes when writing in English online I get comments on how "fancy" my vocabulary is, but it's just because when 2 synonyms of a word exist I tend to think of the one of French origin first
You just shattered down my illusion of having a decent german accent
/Jk
Yes german have "harsher" pronunciation, if that makes sense, and also make "back of the mouth" sounds like the B for instance, while in French we do more "front of the mouth" sounds
I am no expert here and my language classes are far far away now
But don't worry, it has its charm, I still have fond memories of a german fellow student who melted my heart when she was speaking French
Well she was not ugly either, that propably helped
Outch !
Yes, definitely a winner
Gotta love Lyon
I feel like decades' worth of clichés regarding a certain box-shaped musical instrument with keys and the city of Paris answer this question without one even needing to say anything
This is similar to the premise of the Michael Moore movie, "Where to invade next

As a french living in Germany I honestly believe that the French Healthcare is better
Explique-toi
Il y a rien qui me vient quand j'essaie d'imaginer un trait ou une caractéristique générale des français qui soit clairement considérée comme positive ET où on est clairement meilleurs que les autres européens
Je vaux pas dire qu'on est mauvais partout, hein
La plupart des trucs bien c'est de la bouffe, de l'art, des monuments, etc
mais ça compte pas vraiment pour cette question
Après il y a probablement un truc auquel j'ai pas pensé.
I was stopped by the police in Czechia for jaywalking
They didn't fine me, as the younger one said it was close to Christmas, so they'd let me go
Bah ça n'empêche pas ni les Italiens, ni les Allemands, entres autres, de mettre en avant la gastronomie
Et justement
en parlant de cette dernière, c'est clairement notre spécialité, la mode également, notre sens de la diplomacie aussi
Comme l'on dit certains, c'est aussi notre résilience, notre combativité face à l'autorité, ce qui me paraît important dans une démocratie
La fierté aussi, ce qui nous protège de la vanité, et de vouloir sans cesse nous comparer aux autres, le savoir-vivre, le savoir-faire
Il y a tant de choses à dire
in French :
* Maman poule (chicken mother)
* Papa Gateau (Cake father)
Same in French: mère poule
we Also says that those parents "n'ont pas/n'arrivent pasa couper le cordon" => "they didn't/can't cut the  umbilical cord "
I probably never visited half the monuments and museums in Paris
It's just too full of tourists
Really the only times I went to the Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Coeur is when people came to visit me
It happened to me plenty of times, in different cities
The idea behind is that I have plenty of time to visit because I'm living so close, or I'm waiting for a friend to visit it with me
This is a bit stupid because I always regret not visiting enough once I leave
I’m in Paris, never been to Disney land
I don’t really want to go, either
I remember telling a bunch of English kids once (they asked if I’d been there) & they all looked like I murdered their mom or something
It’s a saying that most Parisians have never been up the Eiffel Tower, but I did go there years ago :)
I live not far from Versailles
I remember when I was little why we never went to the palace even though we lived next to it !
Not "never" but there is only 3 valid reasons to climb the Eiffel Tower as a genuine Paris inhabitant : you're a small child, you have a small child, you have a tourist friend
We have hundreds and hundreds of places that only tourists go to lol
In Parisian region we all live at maximum 1H from any monument here, still never gave a shit about them plus there is always way too much tourists
If you ever go, I would recommend trying to pick a time without tourists because the path around Stonehenge isn't super large and it can get crowded quickly
I went to the one in Zagreb last week ! It's kinda cool
It's funny, I've lived close to Paris most of my life and I've never heard of it before a Canadian friend told me about it
It looks super interesting
Definitely a go-to when it's possible
In French we say "Y", pronounced as "i-grec", meaning Greek i (that's just how the letter is called)
Un i-grec deux i-grec trois
EDIT It seems that it's just me who does that XD
In drivers school in order to evaluate the distance with the car in front of you, you need to leaves two seconds between you and them
You spot a mark on the road (end of a line, tree, exit) and you say out loud une-euh seuh-con-deuh - deux -seuh-con-deuh (you spell out exaggerating all the sounds in une seconde deux se conde)
My gramp used "un ti ta deux ti ta trois ti ta" which is slightly shirter than a second but still useful
I do that too
Same here, I was looking for my fellow Frenchmen to discover how we do this in French, sadly I've never heard of "elephants" / "Mississippi" tricks
Sorry about that I just edited, for some reasons reddit disclosed what I've previously written and just sent the message as " tricks ".
That's funny, I've never heard that
I use "Mississippi" or "crocodile"
C'est pas pour les distances de sécurité en voiture ?
Never ever heard that
I usually go with 1, 1 et demi, 1 trois-quarts (1, 1 and a half, 1 and three quarters)
Same in France, I'm so surprised it seems to be a common thing everywhere else because I don't really see the point
> I have the feeling it has been made popular by driving lessons
Yes that's where I learned it too
I use crocodile too
Some people also use "hippopotame".
"Hélicoptère", too
Oui exactement c'est ma monitrice d'auto école qui me disait de compter comme ça. On avait peut être la même xD
I my own specific case, we use it professionally when timing actions on movie sets or when decomposing a scene during rehearsals
Usually we agree on a "unit" beforehand
The most common being "éléphants".
1 éléphants ... 2 éléphants ... 3 éléphants ... eeeet ACTION !
A master in computer sciences, in physics, statistics, engeniering in general and some cultural diploma are the best qualifications in France, in my opinion
That might sound like a joke, but providing you can pay for them, private economic schools might be the best here in France
Masturbate/party through your studies, network enough while partying, get in a high-salary position in a big bank because network, and continue down the party/network lane
Main drawback: if you fail at networking, you're in deep shit as that school ain't paying itself
Diplôme d'ingénieur from a Grande école
Pompous stem diploma from pompous mini universities
If you want to get a job, don't go to a university
Agricultural sciences are a safe degree to follow; near 99% employment rate in the months following getting your degree in France for the good schools
I don't mean don't get any type of higher education but here the "best" options are engineering schools for instance, which is not university
Only highly valued options that are in fact university are law and medicine
Actually good  bread
I'm from the North East of France
There, like Belgium and the Netherlands I believe, we go out for Mardi gras (carnaval) as kids dresses up and knock on doors singing
We get candy
Fairly similar to what some do for Halloween but at another time of year
What I didn't realise was that it's not something every area in France does
So already made a fool of myself mentioning this at my new job
Happens here too
It's usually 25 years off as well
>The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
We have that in France, it's le goûter; some think it's mostly for kids but I find it's really needed if you have lunch at 12 and dinner at 8pm
Hummmm Mexicano and Fricandelle
Hadn't had one of those in many years
(probably for the best but still
That sounds amazing
Hahahahahaahahahahaha
Non
Same, it was my one of my favorite drink when I went to Morocco
I just wonder why we can't have that here
Hihihihihihiihihihihi
Il y a cru
We see the bricks you eat as exactly the same my friend
The secret : they're made of Berlin wall pieces
The true secret : The Berlin wall was made of german bread since the beginning
France
Sure people look at us now as harmless people who surrender often and prefer to spend their time drinking wine and eating our delicious cheese with baguettes while flirting with pretty tourists
but we've done quite a few bad things in our past
I'd say Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Liechenstein
They are filthy rich because of foreign industries settling down there in order to pay less or no taxes
It's some sort of piracy if you ask me
I think in GENERAL, we and the British catch way less flak than we deserve due to the Germans very generous (in regards to our reputation) actions in the 20th century
Recently that feels to be somewhat changing but still especially on Reddit I feel like Americans are much more critical of themselves, and their current administration, to be focusing on us, when in reality we are doing probably equally immoral things with a little bit more class, protester suppressing aside
France is considered to be in the top 5 of the most powerful military forces, and also has baguettes
Yeah what triggers me most about the surrender jokes is that it seems to ignore the fact we're meanies
We would like a word
Heh, overachievers :p
I enjoy them (especially the 15cm scissor) but they are not so popular
We can buy them mostly in haberdashery or hardware store, so i guess people use them for handiwork or sewing
If the 1812 French Empire was reunited today, how would it affect/change your country
The country would be bigger
Pardon, le pays serait plus gros
Les anglos ne dominent plus !
It would, for the best
Napoléon a conquéri plus de territoires que je ne le pensais
It would have the benefit of finally bringing some fucking order to things
Our country would become an empire
Our protest will look more like a global revolution
This time we won't invade Russia during the winter
Damn let's be honest that's the single one post where I got the most comments ever
Love talking with y'all guys !
Edit: Jesus christ my phone just keeps notyfing me of comments I've had more than 100 notifications yet chill out x)
It would be
Interesting
You're croatian if I'm not mistaken
Yeah most of Croatia was French at the time
What's the Konjin
Et merde, on est repartis !
Yeah I guess you're right lol
Yeah he didn't manage to conquer Russia in the end
You would have a government for once
Tbh I do think we wouldn't invade, more diplomatically annex Switzerland
Like seriously mate your while country is both a remote bomb and a giant fortress
Prepare for
BAGUETTE !!
"Remember 1942
Ok good, can you give us back Koeinsberg
Come on, don't be a bitch about it !"
Certainely would, my friend
>We would talk shit of the French government though
Wow, didn't think spanish were willing to assimilate so much to french culture !
We would take Catalonia from a country that doesn't respect refeundums of independancy*
Where you from
Yup
During
Napoleon sold Louisiana to the british after we too it back
Possible small wooosh here, it was actually what his sentence was joking about
>but the French rule is remembered in a positive way
That kinda surprises me, how was French rule good for the region
Ouch
Nay I don't celebrate colonialism
We simply, as French, would rejoice seeing a competent and strong leader in our Government
Napoléon is seen as a strong positive leader in France
(also points missiles) tu vas faire quoi
That's definitely not the case in my own experience, nor anyone I know of
The France I know has a neutral view on Napoleon: not a negative one, but it ain't positive either
That's at least the consensus I've seen when it was discussed in Reddit before
Also people in real life I know agree
Maybe it's a generational thing
(Points at Buger) so will we !
(Points Lafayette and de Grasse) come back, they don't need you not the French support
They'll handle the Royal Navy themselves
Isn't kind of the point of a War
To kill your ennemies
I see
Indeed what you say was true
Schools have not been closed since the first lockdown ended here (we close classes when there are three -now one- covid positive people among the class’s students), but universities have & their students are having a hard time
Depression rates are rising, people are dropping out of university, those who were preparing for a thesis have a hard time accessing libraries for their research
it’s not good
The first lockdown was bad because all schools were closed & some people can’t afford to have a computer for online class, some students don’t have a place at home where they’re away from both siblings and parents to work quietly, etc
When it comes to giving people equal chances in life (thanks to school), lockdown is a disaster
I believe there will be consequences
People want schools closed at the moment
Also, I’m a student not a teacher (hope that’s ok)
Schools have been open since September but if they dare to close them I won't attend classes anymore
The only reason I'm happy to go to school is to see my friends, I'm fed up with those shitty classes
I get back in the bar
If I’m rich, I order French fries there and then, but otherwise the 1:00+ am kebab is the way to go :)
It's too early, would probably go back in
Around 1am a crepe with eggs, ham, potatoes, molten cheese, salad
Might replace ham+cheese by salmon and some kind of parsley sauce
God bless that crepe guy
The next morning I will realize I had the calories equivalent of 3 meals between my dinner, the beers and said crepe and will look my beer belly with disappointment and tell myself next time I'll drink whiskey instead, somehow it doesn't make me hungry
It's funny I don't really have a spanish building that comes in my mind directly
Among those 3 the most popular is probably la Sagrada Familia
For a huge share of us it would be your football stadiums though
The Colosseum (Colisée in french) and the tower of Pisa are the buildings that define your country for me
I had the Reichstag in mind too
De szép
Not a building but the mattehorn would do it for me
It's not a building but what compares the most to the eiffel tower in Switzerland is le jet d'eau in Genève
It's also probably because we don't know much about german speaking Switzerland
I have no idea about this tower
For me, for  Portugal, it is not a place but it would be the azulejos
The little mermaid *has* to be the landmark of Denmark
Wow, looks like a Ufo
A dark force ufo
An Alfa Romeo in a nutshell, beautiful but poorly built
At least in the past
I visited the Atomium years and years ago, there was an exhibition inside, I can't remember what it was about, but it was looking so old and in bad shape
I hope they upgraded it meanwhile because it was truly underwhelming
I concur
Le jet d'eau on Leman lake is for me the iconic manmade landmark of Switzerland
The weather station I think I saw it on movies
Was there a James Bond movie showcasing the weather station
I agree with the Stave churches
This is Norway to me, as far as man made structures are concerned
(From an American living in France) There's a different trend in bike styles between Europe and the US
In Europe, I see a lot more city/utility-style bikes, with a more comfortable upright posture, often with baskets and bells
In the US, I see a lot more road bikes, even in big cities
It could be due to functional differences (more cobblestones in Europe, bigger distances in US), but I think there's a style element too: sleek, minimalist road bikes are fashionable in the US, and upright bikes are seen as bulky
Yeah the french/spanish term of all-terrain bike is far more appropriated
Both here and in the US (Chicago), I don't commute daily by bike, but I would ride for other reasons (go to the park, a friend's house, the store, etc
I usually take public transportation, but sometimes biking is faster, or I just feel like biking
The first time I rode in the street with cars, it was a little nerve-wracking, but I got used to it after a few times
You have to be aware, signal your turns, look before you turn, get comfortable joining in the car traffic when you have to, and get familiar with which streets are good and bad for biking,
Actually, the main divide here is not US vs
Europe, but rural/suburban vs
city biking
And if we're talking about city biking, it's actually way easier in Europe than in the US
There are more bike lanes, city centers have fewer and slower cars, and drivers are much more aware and accommodating of cyclists because there are just more of them
So, if you can bike in an American city, than you can easily bike in an European city
Even if you've never city-biked, you would probably feel fine biking in many European cities
Edit: spelling
We Europeans are gentlemen unlike the Americans
Pretty reductive way to judge a continent but just as ignorant as many europeans are about other parts of the world so fair enough
[Fortunately your priest was wrong
> basashi
Kumamoto
The best time I had in Japan
Basashi is not that good, but everything else was fantastic
Pretty sure most europeans would have trouble giving the names of 10 african countries
My question is why shouldn't they
Today we have more access to information than ever before, wouldn't it be a shame not to take advantage of this to be informed about the world
I consider it to be basic general knowledge anyone should have, it's just an example among others
I mean, ever since we « gained freedom » from the Roman Empire ?
There were short periods here and there of military occupation, but it doesn't really count
It's not like the state was abolished
I guess some people would count the Hundred Years War as partial « English occupation », but to me it's always been more of a series of French civil wars than anything else
And the State was still around anyhow
That reminds me of a talk I had years ago with an Argentinian on July 14
He told me « ah yeah, it's your independence day ». I stood baffled for a few second as the thought of France having an independence day was so incredibly strange and unexpected
Needs definition of country and after that Freedom
Anyway I'll go with the to main french aswers :
"Le liberté est choix" - Sartre
From 476/843 to today, with 4 years of occupation by the nazis between 1940 and 1944
We were occupied until 1789 by filthy royals but then guillotine happened
Then we had a restauration of kings from 1815 to 1848, but again we got rid of them at the end
We also got occupied by Nazis from 1940 to 1945
Same here, I think .
you can had the fivision of France just after the napoleonic war (in 1815), then
Because for us, Germany and Italy did'nt fully invade us either, we still had part free, ans the Vicky government, was more free than others pupets
Germany occupied all of France in 1942
The "free zone" was only a thing for 2 years
Execpt on overseas level
What
Paris is the core of a 12 million people metropolitan area and doesn't look like the movie Amélie Poulain
People actually live there
I want my mone back
Las Vegas
Absolute soulless shithole
No culture, no vibe
Only money is something here
À 2$ watch pretending to be a Rolex
Vilnius and Warsaw
I prefer Krakow and Riga !
Well, I'm sorry to break it to you but
Valencia made a much better impression on me than Barcelona
> Braşov
I loved it though
It's lovely and it's pretty nice to go hiking around
Also I ate my first kürtoskalacs on the central square
Irish fans left a very good impression I must say
Not onlyin Paris
Lol
Paris was dirty af in the 60s and 70s. Cars were [everywhere] Buildings were [black with soot] There were [literal slums] all around the city
It got better not worse
Thank you, I didn't get insulted enough today
So basically you went to Paris in 2017, went to shitholes, took the RER A and ate at bad restaurants, got it
I liked it when I visited a few years ago, it didn't feel like such a shithole tbh
Plus, *boulets*, *pékèt* and good beer
Amen brother, cheers from Irak
If i asked for the cheapest shot in the bar, the barman would ask for my ID and refuse to sell me a shot
I don't know why though
If your goal is getting drunk, it can (should) be a factor
That would be the rational choice
Not sure about the whole curriculum, but my 11 year old son is being taught right now about the birth of writing which includes Sumurian, Egyptian and Greek civilisations
He's been taught about Romans too
I remember some words about Mesopotamia, then it's mostly Rome and Greece during classical era
There's some Ancient Egypt too I think ?
The letter itself is pronounced \aʃ\, ash
The h is silent in French, but it affects pronunciation nonetheless: an initial h is supposed to prevent [liason] & [elision] ; but as usual with French, there are a lot of exceptions
It's silent but it changes the pronounciation of the letter that is before it, e.g. ch sounds like sh
I always thought the exceptions were based on the origin of the word
If from latin, then you can make a liaison, if not, then you don't.
The presence of the letter "h" directly behind the letter "c" creates the phoneme "ch" which is pronounced like the sound "sh" in English
I have seen the word "ihminen" said with sometimes a /ç/ and some other times a /x/, so I'm getting a but confused
That is indeed the case most of the time; but there are many exceptions, and the etymology of many words is not obvious immediately
Oh stop it you
No, ash is the right way to say it
[Pronunciation here]
The English word "ash" is basically pronounced like the letter H is in French (or the French word "hache" for that matter)
ash is /æʃ/ in English; æ doesn't exist in France French, except in some dialects
But the French /a/ is closer approximation to the English /æ/ than the /ʌ/ of ush
Look, I don't know what to tell you
The sound a French person makes when saying the letter H, as in reciting the alphabet is the same sound an English speaker makes when saying the word ash
The sentence you mentioned is not counterindicative at all
Edit: I guess you mean the a is longer in English
If so, then sure I guess
As much as I can see how "ash" is not exactly pronounced like "hache" (which is really how the letter H is pronounced, at least with a northern city accent) because the a sound in ash is longer I strongly disagree that the first syllable in "usher" is closer
It just isn't, there is an "a" sound when we say the letter H.
Well, I guess when you put it like that, sure
I don't know, I feel like you're saying "ash" with an American accent or something, but maybe it's me who imagines "ash" said in such a way that English speakers don't actually do
As for usher
it's so strange to me
I'll concede that your recording is convincing
again, maybe how "usher" sounds in my head is different than how it's actually pronounced, idk
I mean I have no particular interest in some of them, but not to that extent
If I had time and money, I would visit them all
None ! they all seem to be very interesting
Well, I've already visited many European countries: France, Belgium, Netherland, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovinia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Italy, Vatican, Monaco, Spain and Portugal + some overseas EU areas like Martinique, Guadeloupe and Canarias
(and of course many non-European countries)
I just wanted to show off on my travel experience
Honestly I'll like to visit more of Eastern Europe (Czech Rep
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria
), Iceland also (I guess it's a place to visit at least once in your life), maybe Istanbul as well
I think I'll also like to visit St Petersburg
There is no countries that I'll never consider visiting
There aren't any that I would never consider but some I don't really care about and we don't particularly have a good (or bad) opinion of, I just don't really care about south eastern Europe that much, except maybe Greece
Mind you I don't mean this to be derogatory towards those countries or people from there, it's more a question of my own ignorance
France once I get out of there
I'm honestly scared of my home country at times
I've lived in Nice and so Monaco is really close
To me the only attraction of Monaco is the Oceanographic Museum
The building is beautiful, facing the Mediterranean and the museum is full of relics, sea animals conserved in Formol, old scientific drawings of animals, and it has a nice aquarium (the Aquarium isn't the best I've seen, it's the Museum part that is more exceptional)
But then it's only worth going there if you have interest in marine life and museum
However if you're on a trip in the Côte D'Azur, on your way from Nice to Menton, it's worth taking a break at this museum for like 2h!
I think that Paris is still better than London tho
We are experts in this matter
Let me help you
I'm living up to my stereotype
If you'd ask me, Dunkirk is the best city in Europe
but I might be biased as well
Come come
To refer to a place far away, do you use the name of an imaginary place and/or real place ?
In French it's common to use *Pétaouchnok*, name of an imaginary town or island far far away
*Perpètes-les-oies*, from *Perpètes* slang for far away or long ago and *les oies*, ~~swans~~ geese, to give it a more rural feel
*Bab El Oued*, a town somewhere in Algeria
Oies = geese (goose singular) not swan :)
I've also heard "Veracruz" and "Ouagadougou" (capital of Burkina Faso) used to refer to faraway places a few times
I'm French and I absolutely don't know "Pétaouchnok", I only know "Perpètes".
We also use Tataouine (a town in Tunisia)
Oh right
"So, what's the name of your current king ? "
Dude
Guillotine Ier ?
She meant mostly cheese and bread, don't be offended
We really like food from elsewhere, it's just frustrating as a French to travel and never find proper cheese or baguette
For exemple, I know the Auchan along the mediterranean sea (in other countries than France ofc) are considered a haven by the sailing community, because they have usually the best food amongst the small costal harbors supermarket
We have probably emptied our stock
It did, and it was rightly seen as a tragedy
Now, as to the reason why it hasn’t got as much media coverage as the NZ shooting (because I’ve been getting frustrated at posts in certain other subreddits purporting that evil Europeans just don’t care about the lives of people who don’t live in the first world)
School shootings are seen as less motivated than killing a bunch of muslims in a mosque
They’re just less ideological
The NZ shooter basically parrotted all alt-right talking points that you find on subs like thedonald (so it’s no surprise that they’re actively defending him)
From what i remembered
If you are being attack, you can defend yourself with the same level or less, exemple, if you are in a fight with a knife, a gun is judge to be more powerful, so you can't use it
You cant use a knife in a fist fight, ect
Some sportsmen can't use their knowledge because of the risk they represent to the other person
And of course, having a weapon in the street is illegal, you can't even bring a fake gun if it's looking like a real one (and you need a licence to buy it (depend of the kind of fake gun))
Loosely related, but: here (France) you are supposed to act if someone close to you is being harmed
Those people who filmed George Floyd’s death
They would have been tried, here, for "non assistance à personne en danger" (not helping someone in harms way)
Because the law says that they _have_ to help in such a situation
(Well, the police thing makes it a bit complicated, but I’m pretty sure it still works
It’s not self defense, but I thought you might be interested since it’s... collective defense
Sort of
IIRC there are 3 conditions :
-proportionality as you said : for exemple a man was harassing a woman she took her high hells and pierced his eye, it was judged disproportionate
The proportionality is judged based on the consequences and not the act by itself
Also the proportionality is judged more strictly if it's to protect a property and not a person
-necessity : you have to protect someone/sth by doing the act if it's a vengeance it's not a necessity, if running can save you it's the same
-the act and the reaction must be at the same time : it's a condition that's linked with the last one
We consider that if the act is already done and the aggressor has left it's the police's job and not the victim's job to make him pay
It's been quite a long time so someone may correct me if I'm wrong
There is one exception to the second rule : if you are attacked at night in your home (domicile principal) there is no requirement to run away
I'd like to add that the legitimate defence is an affirmative claim meaning that you have to prove that the use of force was legal to avoid punishment
Except, once again, in the case where it happened at night in your home then the prosecution has to prove that your use of force was not legitimate
It would most likely not
There is _one_ case that has been in court for years, and the dead guy had pre-existing conditions according to a first autopsy
The problem is, the second autopsy’s results were different
But that’s one (still very sad) case in years
Thanks for the great precisions, to add to the end one of the tricky situations is related to traps : is your trap positioned at a height that shows your intent to kill or to a reasonable height to wound
Do you have a military police doing the police job in rural areas ?
In France there is the Nationale Police ( Police Nationale ) for the cities and a military police ( Gendarmerie ) for countryside and rural areas
They have [very recognizable cars] in dark blue with flashy yellow stripes and overall they are way more respected and liked than the regular police
Who is doing the police stuff in your countryside ?
Yes, it is called "Gendarmerie" (Men in arms)
They tend to be closer to people, more helpful
They are more appreciated than regular Police
I never understood why you have so many police forces
Is there a difference in how they are perceived by the population
Why
They have about the same as we do (fewer actually, since they don't have municipal police forces)
The main difference is that their guardia di finanza have a wider jurisdiction than our douane
Gendarme comes from "Gens d'armes" which means "armed people" in French
In the same city you can see the municipale, la polizia, and the carabinieri
It is a bit confusing
Good to know
Very different from France
I don't think there is *such* a shift in citizen's views on police and gendarmerie
You should leave your cave from time to time
And you shouldn't be passive/aggressive at all
Excuse me for not having read an articles on the matter
I wasn't stating a truth, just a feeling/opinion based on what I see
But thanks anyway, it was an interesting article
There has been protests against police violence for months
That's objective, not passive agressive
And in my head the gendarmerie was also a part of those protest
First because the gendarmerie is often a part of protest's suppression
And even though, yes, they are less violent than the police, they aren't perfect for all that
And also because I think that for a lot of people, police nowadays is a word that represents all the law-enforcement
Because I actually have been following all the protests against the police
It is actually one of the thing I've been the most interested in and disgusted by at the same time for the last 4 years
I also am very very sad that I couldn't watched "Un Pays Qui Se Tient Sage" before theatres were closed again
So, yes I think you were being passive aggressive
Whether it was an objective observation
And yes, my view on those two different trade certainly was blurred
Because if the gendarmerie isn't as rottent as the police it should be said and praised
But I still think that the authority they represent isn't liked either
Because it's not because they aren't the police now, that they can't and won't be
Also, I'm very much sorry if I, myself, sound passive/aggressive
That's really not what I'm trying to do
Have a good evening and a great end of your weekend :D
Which words in your language have a very special story
Like those in description
For example
The word for fox in french :
Renard has a very special story as it was first in middle age a first name like Louis or Pierre
The name for a fox was goupil back then
Then a kid story became very popular about a "goupil" called Renart, it became so popular that people began to call all fox Renard, and then the first name became the name of the animal
Goupil doesn't mean anything now in french but we can find the word in other word like Bottle brush which is "goupillon" as it seems like a fox tail or the world "goupiller" which means something like "have suspicious activity" as fox are seen as clever and cunning
The word today (you probably heard about it):
Today in french is "aujourd'hui", which is a strange word with a ' in the middle
It's because at first hui meaned today
People being french they love complicated ways ( we are the people who use "four twenty ten" for ninety ) so they always said "on the day of today" which was  "au jour d'hui", and it became aujourd'hui ! So now if you say "on the day of today" in french you basically say something like "on the day of the day of today" !
Edit:
World -> Word
Renard (name of the character) -> Renart
In Esperanto, there is a verb "kabei" which means to leave the Esperantist movement
It is based on the pseudonym of Kazimierz Bein, Kabe, who was a famous Esperantist who was super involved in the movement and suddenly left and cut ties with the movement
Just a little correction: The goupil was called "Renar*t*" in *Le Roman de Renart* (12th century)
And indeed I've heard people saying "au jour d'aujourd'hui" which means "on the day of the day of today", but they don't even notice it, this became pretty common
Már láttam tegnap egy másik subredditen de még érdekesebb
I think the author was talking about a story whoch is called "Le roman de renart". It was not really a book as stories were added by unkown authors
It was basically folklore
I do not remember when it all started and whever some of them where translated abroad, but it would be worth diging
I didn't know the story existed in other countries, very interesting
You are right this is not a kid story, I made this mistake because when I was in school, we used to read an adaptation of this story for kids, bit the original version is as you said more an epic story
Thanks for the correction ! I should have verified the spelling beforehand
This one is funny ahah
In french we have a similar word: démerder, which has exactly the same root (merde=shit, dé like UNmake ) but it means "do it by yourself" or "taking yourself out of trouble"
Thanks, I corrected it
Well, in schools years you learn about the big events, and sometimes really summarized, then you personally learn two things: Detailled country history, and Detailled local History
This might seem weird to an american, but in europe there can be a Completely differents approach and/or events within 50km of distance (30/35 Miles)
An example is in my homeland, Southeast of France
Nice and Provence were totally different countries, and even fought each other
The Provencial history is strongly attached to France, While Nice's history is strongly attached to Italy's. But to give you an Idea, I lived 70km away from Nice, and am far in Provence
If you take a larger scale, the differences within a same countries are insane
Scottish POV and Northen Irish are so different, same for Bretagne's and Alsace in France, or Catalogna and Andalousia in Spain
History is very, very complex in europe, and if you want to know everything, well you learn it by yourself or you don't. And yet, I am really passionate about history, but I don't have a clue about Poland's History for example, through we are on the same Continent/Union
Skip stuff
Two reasons:
Countries do not unite, even if they have the same monarch
Elisabeth II is queen of both Canada and England, yet they are two different countries
Marrying the monarch of a country does not make you ruler of that country but "queen consort / consort". For instance, the Queen of England is Elisabeth II, and her husband is her consort (and also "prince of Greece and Denmark" - but he was born with that title, and, similarly, Elisabeth II did not gain that title when she married him)
Theoretically, the last year of high school is the year you turn 18
So you start university at 18 (or 17 if you are born late in the year)
How many years do you have
It's 12 for us, I thought it was the most common
Maybe we start elementary school at a different time
It's supposed to be at 6 but if you are born between September and December you'll start it at 5
So maybe in other countries it's "you are already 6 so you start school" and not "you'll be 6 this year"?
In France we have 3 (optionnal) years pre elementary school, 5 years of elementary school, 4 years of middle school and 3 years of high school
That's the difference then, we do 5 years, 4 years, and 3 years
But I think you also have shorter days and shorter vacation
We have way too long days (often had 8:00 - 18:00 in high school) and longer vacation
For France, assuming you're going all the end to high school degree (and not going the apprenticeship way at the end of middle school), it's :
- 3 years of kindergarten (École maternelle), ages 2/3 to 5/6
- 5 years of elementary school (École primaire) ages 6/7 to 10/11
- 4 years of middle school (Collège), ages 11/12 to 14/15
- 3 years of high school (Lycée), ages 15/16 to 17/18
Didn't the maternelle years became mandatory during Macron's mandate
Metz -> Mettis -> Mediomatrici, the celtic tribe which ruled the area and had its oppidum on what is nowadays the historical center of the city (for info, this neighborhood hosts the city museum which is directly built on the roman thermae
They’re included to the exhibition and it’s pretty impressive
I currently live in Nancy for my studies; the town was firstly built around 664, and its name come from the Celtic word "Nant", meaning swamp, as the town was built on the shores of the Meurth in the middle of marshy plains
Now there’s hardly a swamp around but there is still remnants of it
My hometown Miribel means in Latin Jolie vue or nice view, because there is a nice view up the hill over the town and the Rhône Valley
Lyon comes from latin Lugdunum, the name of the city changed with the language
I don't know where Lugdunum comes from though
I live in Nantes
It apparently comes from the latin name "Portus Namnetes", which means the harbor of the Namnetes
The Namnetes were the tribes that lived here during the Roman Empire
Or from the King Namnès who founded the city, it's not sure
Another possibility is that it comes from "nanto" which means valley or river in latin (the biggest river in France, the Loire, goes through the city)
[My source (in french)]
My hometown is Le Vésinet in France, it comes from latin Visiniolum which means "neighbouring place" because
Well i guess its because its neighbouring other places
Lyon, France:
Come from the old Latin name of the city: *Lugdunum* wich became l*ugdon*, then *luon* then *Lyon*
Before that, we have several hypotheses about "*Lugdunum*" 's origin:
\- From the celtic words  *lougounos* (raven) and *dounon* (high place) because the city have 2 hills
\- From  *Dunum* (hills) and  *Lug* (light)
\- From *Lugus/Lug* (a local celtic god) and  *duno* (fortress)
Marseille originates from latin Massilia / Greek Massalia (Μασσαλία)
Marseille is an ancient Greek colony in the middle of ligurian tribes territory of what is now South-East France
The city was founded in 600 bc by Greek settlers from Phocaea
For this reason in French, Marseille is sometimes called la cité Phocéenne (the Phocaeaian city)
I grew up in Amiens in the north of France, the name comes from the gallic tribe that lived which was called Ambiani
I now live in Lyon and there is no certitude
It was invaded and renamed Lugudunum, it then became Lugdon and then Luon and then Lyon
No one really knows what Lugudunum meant though
A Celtic tribe lived here, and my town's name comes from the tribe's name
As for the village of my childhood, the origin is not well-known and it could either come from "land,' "ground," "fertile ground," or "ground that brings in a certain amount of money (could come from the word used to mean money) per year," or even the Gaullic word for "rock"
My hometown is the city of Lorient in Brittany, its name comes from the fact it was a trade harbour made especially for the French East India Company by Louis XIV's will ( compagnie des Indes orientales ) and so their heavy ships could bring in Europe goods from trading with eastern world
And in french one word to describe the East is also "L'Orient", so eventually the city developping around the harbor took the name of "Lorient" through the years
Fun fact, the area was chosen because an old citadel made by the spanish when they landed a force in Britanny in 1591 could have total control of the harbour's entry
Today this citadel is famous for being a museum of the french east india company
Reims comes from the celtic tribe that lived here during the Conquest of the Gaule by Julius Ceasar
They were the *Rems* and were one of the most important tribe of the region
If I remember correctly they were one of the only tribe to actualy like the Romans and cooperate while all the other tribes tried to resist
I'm gonna put Bordeaux here since it's kind of the same origin: first known as burdigala
Burd means muddy and cal means Shelter
The city was build on a plateau next to the Garonne River and was surrounded by marshes (that don't really exist anymore)
Lug is a celtic god and dunum means fortress, so the Fortress of lug
It's not unfortunately
The ruins of the castle got destroyed to build a 30m statue of Marie
The view from up there is beautiful though
In the good days (when diffraction is not too bad and we have a good visibility), you can see all of the eastern Alps, including the Mont Blanc, that is pretty singular by its shape
This meaning comes from the colour of the Bordeaux wines
The city lies something like 30 km from the coast, but the River is already quite large at this point, the estuary being only a few km away
It's also still influenced by the tide and the city and surrounding areas is crisscrossed by a series of smaller rivers, called "estay" , the level of which varies with the tide
So yeah, one Can make this assumption, me included before i checked the wikipedia page (it also has a breakdown of the évolution of the name if you're intéressed)
Londunum :)
You just made me realize how close both étymologies are, lugdunum and londunum
In french : Rrrrrrrr
Verb is "ronroner"
The noise is “ronron” though not just “rrrr”
Not going to argue with u. But we use the word ronron but when we do the noise it's more rrrrrr
But I have to admit my mother is Spanish ... So it might explain
France : Paris University, La Sorbonne, the National Superior School
But truth is it depends what you want to learn, each university has its own field they are best at
Paris Sud, La Sorbonne and l'École normale supérieure i think
In France the way to go for good students (especially in science) is not universities but [“Grandes écoles”] (literally “high schools”) which have a special status and deliver diplomas in engineering and business
You enter them through national exams
Public French engineering schools have a very good reputation (better than the private ones)
There are no public business schools
Among the most famous ones: [l'École Polytechnique] and [CentraleSupélec] for engineering, [HEC Paris] and [l'ESSEC] for business
If you want to do a carreer in politic, it's almost mandatory to go to l'[ENA] and [Sciences Po]
Paris-Dauphine , HEC , ESSEC , ESCP , TSE or PSE, if you study Business or Economics
>Paris University, La Sorbonne
Neither really exists though (or more specifically there are 17 universities in the region, 13 "Paris University" (some of which are not in Paris) with 3 of them being named after the Sorbonne)
Paris 7 (not the "historical" Sorbonne which is Paris 1) offers it and has links with the CNRS research lab
A friend of mine did his PhD there (in Computer Science, not Linguistics though) and didn't complain
See here :
I don't really know but I guess la Sorbonne might be a good one
The University of Lyon 2 is quite good too
I wish you luck on your studies
We have universities too
But there are less prestigious than “Grandes écoles” because they are not selective
Even though you will learn the same things
There are researchers in both systems
But in this case “grandes écoles” are often associated with universities
Sorry
It depends of what you are looking for
Generally speaking I would say that an engineering grade is more valuable on the job market
If you want to do a career in academics, either way is ok
I graduated from an engineering school, and I have friends that did a PhD
An engineering grade is equivalent to a Master of Science
The best advice I could give you is to look at the classes and do what suits you the most
In french the "Sirène" is a mermaid
From [Wikipedia]
> In the folklore of some modern cultures, the concept of the siren has been assimilated to that of the mermaid
For example, the French word for mermaid is sirène, and similarly in certain other European languages
People being openly rude to waiters and the waiter is taking it with a smile because she needs the tip
It would not go down well at all with a French waiter
Any US movie / TV series where someone gets out of jail by paying a shit load of money
Yeah, they'll just kick you out and put you on the banned list and won't give a shit if you let a bad review on yelp
To be fair Spiderman would not work in rural America
I assume it is the same in the US though it’s just the movie being silly
Benalla, Balkany, Kerviel
In France they would be stopped by the toll booth of the motorway
It does not really exist much in France either
>catholic Lord of the Rings
Well it already is
they didn't had to pay a lot of money
"high speed"
I was at home alone while my mother worked when I was a child
Would even cook lunch
they only had to *have* loads of money
It's more Tripadvisor or Google Maps in France at least
Pretty much the same thing here, you usually leave a couple coins on the table when you leave if you had a really great time
You don't have to though
or good friends
And even then nobody cares about them
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
In France we all learn academic French at school, but accents and slangs may strongly vary depending on the region
We don't have a standard dialect, so everyone would speak with their own prononciation
Maybe some people would make efforts to ditch words that are specific to the region, but others would use them proudly, to teach them, or implying that they are as important as the usual words
True I have no problem understanding most Alemannic dialects
In fact when I was hospitalised in Blüdenz (Vorarlberg) it was better for me to speak Alsatian to the nurses and doctors than Hochdeutsch
Baguettes
We have ravioles [Ravioles du dauphiné] most people just boil them but you can make soup, gratin, even pizza with them
They are filled with  parsley , cheese and cottage cheese
They look a bit like Italian Ravioli but they are definitly differents
Oliebollen
Or appelbollen rather, since you need something inside the dough
I love these
Came here to say that because I live in Dauphiné. It's really specific to the area
Ooh I always thought they were Italian
Thank you for reminding me that the word is "raviolo"...
In French, we always use the plural form "ravioli" : un ravioli, des raviolis
It's quite easy to perfectly boil them: as soon as they float/go back up the saucepan they're cooked and you gotta strain them
Can't overcook them of you follow this simple rule
If you're making them as a gratin, 30 to 45 min is generally ok
Blasphème !! It’s most probably Italian inspired as there is a huge Italian community around Grenoble/Valence area
Hola malotru ! C'est une spécialité dromoise/Isèroise ! Le terroir ça se respecte !
Chocolatine vs Pain au chocolat
Pain au chocolat vs
FUCKING WRONG*
Non ! C'est :
Pain au chocolat vs Chocolatine :)
*That is exactly same bakery product, just two different names in France
A fierce fight about that crucial matter appears every other day on* r/france
EDIT: bakery product
Note that there is a third camp in the North, those who simply call it «petit pain». Wildlings
A southwestern savage must have corrupted her
Bakery = boulangerie
Baked good = produit de boulangerie
Croissant au chocolat is a version uses by really few alsacian, I think couque is belge and nobody use "petit pain" to speak about the pain au chocolat
Anyway, each real French know that the only right word is pain Chocolat
Oups
Merci pour la correction
They say "petit pain" in the North
Petit pain is commonly used in the north and north-east and croissant au chocolat isn't restricted to Alsace but is also used in Moselle and parts of Meurthe-et-Moselle
Really
I thought the québécois had a different word
TIL I guess
Some even say "petit pain".
>Digging large holes at the Beach
Didn't you get the memo
The war is over and there is no need of the Atlantikwall anymore
Throwing an axe in between someone's legs, what could go wrong
Austria
I love their beer, I love their schnitzel, I love their trains, I love their motherfucking MOUNTAINS
I love that Vienna is so modern and clean, but the people's attitudes are just as grumpy and Parisian as Paris
I love its cafés, its old town, it's relative affordability in comparison to other highly livable cities
I love Innsbruck and the Alps and the fact that it actually snows there
I'd move there in a heartbeat if I could
Currently it's Norway
I'm not fan of out warm climate and I'd love to go to the beautiful fjords
Estonia for sure !
I did an Erasmus in northern Sweden and loved the landscapes, the nature, the free-roaming right, the food, and I know Estonia has this all, plus an amazing and fascinating culture, complex history, super cool sounding uralic language(s), and it's flat and small enough that I'll be able to ride by bicycle around it !
I don't have a crush on any country but I love everything about Ancient Greek & Roman & Egyptian culture
I basically want to be travel around the mediterranean sea and get lost in every part of it
I've been living in Mexico for 11 years
Can confirm it's a great country with amazing culture, delicious food, incredible landscapes and very nice people
+ it's cheap
Have you heard of Guedelon
Not only are we preserving Medieval architecture from time to time we are building brand new one
I rather my french passport, EU is not a nation or a country, it makes no sense to have a European passport because there is no European nationality because the European Union is not a country, it is an economic union
Indyref 2: Electric Boogaloo
It's the same than in english: tête, épaule, genoux, pied, the only difference it's that they say "2 eyes, 2 ears and one month and one nose
But we don't sing it often, and when kids learn it it's in english to learn body parts so
We have other song about body parts like "Jean petit qui danse"
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
J'ai deux yeux, deux oreilles,
Une bouche et un nez
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
Pretty much the same, excepted that we explicitly count the number of eyes, ears, mouth and nose
Never heard about it
Currently for penal reasons I would say Balkany (mayor of a small city next to Paris) and his wife
He is just absolutly corrupt and barely hid it
It's very probably that he had some friends in high places to remain in politics that long
He is currently sleeping in jail after various trials for tax fraud and corruption
In the past Charles Pasqua was known for being cited in many investigation and several trials
His tactic was "When you are in the heart of a scandal, you have to create a scandal within the scandal, and if necessary a scandal within the scandal within the scanl until no one understands anything anymore".
When it comes to lack of credibility I would say Manuel Valls
He is seen as an opportunistic clown who would gobble hairy balls in public for any political responsibility
He was ridiculed as a prime minister, then tried to become the candidate of Parti Socialiste at the primaries
When he was not elected during the primaries he tried to jump ship and beg Macron for any political responsibility, Macron told him to fuck off so he won a deputy seat (while an antisemitic humorist and some guy who had been arrested for slapping Valls in the street ran against him collaboratively just to mock and humiliate him)
He then tried to run for mayor in Barcelona (he has both citizenships) and got humiliated there too
This guy is probably the most pathetic person to ever hold an office, he just has litterally no dignity
I can’t pick between Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Jérôme Cahuzac
both make people feel a bit nauseous
Phillipe Pétain
Not a politician at first, but man did he fell after WW2
De Gaulle said that "he died in 1925"
France, and I hesitate between Napoleon III and Pétain
People remember the latter better, but according to people who lived then the Second Empire was hell on earth (too)
Queen Brunehaut
Ended up despised by everyone, tortured for three days, killed by a wild horse and her body burnt
Phillipes Petain, the definition of "fallen hero"
We're talking modern times there, cause otherwise, it's Pétain all the way my dude
Bernard Tapie was also seen as an up-and-coming, charismatic 'third way' politician in the late 1980s, early 1990s. He gained praise for his aggressive debating tactics against Jean-Marie Le Pen
Now his name is synonymous with corruption
And then there's also DSK who is, well, just rapey
He would have likely been elected president had he been able to keep his dick in his pants
For the non-French here, Jérôme Cahuzac is the epitome of political hypocrisy
He was President Hollande's Minister of the Budget, which meant he had to look into tax fraud
Cahuzac was eventually found guilty of
tax fraud
After telling an interviewer, "Looking at you in the eyes, I swear I have never held a bank account in Switzerland
Turns out he held a bank account in Switzerland
Modern, yeah, maybe, but overall, Pétain, obviously
Yeah of course
It's why I only mentioned pretty recent ones
I think Laval is by far the one that everybody blames for most of the exaction of Vichy
Pétain is still remembered and honored has the savior of Verdun, therefor way more mixed fealing towards him
After, historicaly by oder of importance, I'll say Napoleon III and maybe Louis XVI and/or Marie-Antoinette
Is it deserved or not is an other story
(Basicaly the symboles of the type of rule that France had that weren't republicain)
I think that even if France has had worst leader before the Revolution, no one cares about them anymore
Depends on the country, but generally we're more rigid with degrees and certifications
Getting into the job market is certainly harder, but getting thrown out of it is also harder
We're more anxious about getting hired than fired
I really can't understand how having a 100 different brands of processed foodstuff is any criterion for better life quality
Many Americans have mentioned it in this thread and for me if anything it shows poor  quality food preferences
In Europe in general one can find local and seasonal produce and a fair choice of processed stuff, even in small places
Perhaps these people are looking to buy the brands they used back home
If one's not going to try local stuff, why move at all
I don't get it
Edit: that's a cute handle you have there
I find that just sick and decadent really
Exactly
And then pretend it's a great thing for quality of life
I prefer to spend my time on a terrace café rather than in front of a 30 metre long aisle of cookies in the supermarket
I've lived long term in 5 countries in Europe and a couple more in America
Perhaps I do lack the ability to yearn for "home" stuff because I moved a lot, and I don't really have a place I consider my home country
I do sometimes want to have a taste of this or that,  stuff that is not common where I am currently, but I'll just wait until I visit again or go without, no big deal
Same for mother tongue stuff, I don't miss it
I understand
Free leisure options are pretty limited, right
The question is, can people not have it because the offer is just not there, or would people (excluding tourists) not use the opportunity to just sit there and people watch if available
The whole society is geared towards consumerism: one's time is either used to produce money or spend it
Sorry friend, I'll have an espresso for you
In France, we also have the well but we don’t use because it wins against both the rock and the scissors so it’s not fair
They're less culturally suited to Anglo-Saxon liberalism, which has become the rule as we're plugged into the US' systems
That's also the reason why what used to be the backwaters of Europe has prospered in the late 20th c.
Because the euro is overvalued for our economies
The EU prohibits the control of financial and commodity flows
As a result our domestic production is more expensive to export, which has the consequence of causing factory closures and relocations in Eastern Europe, where because of the EU there is no control possible
As a result, unemployment is increasing due to the application of disastrous neoliberal policies
The peoples of southern Europe do not want to be stripped twice as the neoliberals demand after destroying our jobs, they want to destroy our public services to align themselves with the northern Europeans who have no culture of contesting power
There are two ways to reduce unemployment: either abolish neo-liberalism, regain our borders, our currency and engage in protectionism, or else submit even more to those responsible for the current situation and allow our public services to be destroyed like the Nordic people
+ note that unemployment stats are fake for us
The lack of work ethics is staggering in whole of Spain and Portugal, no wonder they're falling out of the world stage
I'm hopeful about Italy
There is always innovation and competitiveness in the north but the south may get out of its slump too
Greece is somewhat relying on foreign investment
How does this not bother you
I have not dealt any business in Portugal but the time I spent in Spain was excruciating
It takes forever to get anything done and it's so aggravating
Yet they're all so chill about it
Are you all OK with languishing your life away
What’s the median salary in Austria
We should compare the ratio of the two
I do love imagining an army of Finns raking the forest though
Oh really
Who was this famous French politician
And what was the context
I'm curious
Oh, so he was complaining about your support for the Irak war ?
Well, fundamentally, I agree with him
Europe should not have supported this intervention
But he should not have say that this way, it was really arrogant and condescending
>The British papers took the opportunity to diss the french
Haha obviously :)
And that's at this period Chirac get the surname "the worm" by the British press
No , people should be able only if they are citizen
They can already vote in the communes\*. For national elections they need citizenship
No but a little yes
For presidential elections : no
For legislative elections : No
BUT I could be open for having **ONE** deputy that can represent foreigners in a country
Only french citizens should be able to vote in elections even for local one
This
If you want to vote for national election become a national citizen
For a national matter the rule needs to be simple and show at least some commitment to the nation
Giving non national a right to vote in national will only give fuel to xenophobia and right ext
Doing so would only end in civil war or some sort of nationalist taking power to get rid of it
To vote for a nation you need to be part of it end of story
In French, we have many but here are some absurd ones I like :
Tu vas pas nous en chier une horloge (you won't shit a clock about it) - - said when someone is making a fuss for something unnecessary
For the same situation, we also use "en faire tout un fromage" (to make a whole cheese about smth)
On n'est pas sorti de l'auberge ! (We're not out of the inn
) - - said when you're facing a difficult situation and you can't see an end to it in a foreseeable future
Être con à bouffer de la merde ! (to be dumb enough to eat shit) - - said to speak of someone you consider really dumb
Ça casse pas trois pattes à un canard
(It doesn't break three legs to a duck) - - said about smth that is good without being great/amazing
Prendre quelqu'un entre quatres yeux
(take someone between four eyes) - - have an argument
Poser in lapin (To put a rabbit) - - to stand somebody up/not come to an agreed place
Prendre un râteau (to take a rake) - - when someone refuses to become you boyfriend /girlfriend
Also works with mettre un râteau (put a rake) when you're the one refusing
My favourite one from French (the best are always the vulgar ones) is to refer to someone stupid/ugly and saying “il a été fini à la pisse” (he was finished with urine (by their dad))
Un de perdu dix de retrouvés (one lost, 10 found)
I never understood that thing
Usually people say that when someone gets dumped by his girlfriend/boyfriend in order to cheer the person up
But I don't know what that really means
Je suis pas un lapin de 6 semaines (I am not a 6 weeks old rabbit) = I am not an idiot/naive person
Un nom a coucher dehors (litteraly a name to sleep outside) = a very lame name
Mon cul
(My ass) = when someone lies to you and you don't believe the lie
Bonus: Et mon cul c'est du poulet
(And my ass is made out of chicken
) It is the same meaning but the polite way to say it is "Mon œil ! (My eye)
Femme qui rit, a moitié dans son lit (Woman who laughs, half-way in your bed) = a dumb way to say that women like funny men
Grenouille de bénitier (frog of the holy water bowl) =someone really christian but in a mocking way
Il faut pas pousser mémé dans les orties (don't push grandma in the nettles) = don't exagerate
*Il a ete berc*é *trop pr*é*s du mur* : "he has been rocked too close to the wall", implying someone had his head repeatedly banged on the wall as a baby, resulting in being a moron
&#x200B;
*Il ne faut pas pousser M*é*m*é *dans les orties* : "one shall not push Granny in the nettles", meaning that someone is pushing something too far
A similar one with the same meaning : "Il lui manque 15 minutes de cuisson" (He's missing 15 minutes of cooking)
Haha probably my favourite as well
Funny thing we have this expression too but it really doesn't mean the same
We say "c'est à se taper le cul par terre" (it's to hit your ass against the ground) to refer to something extremely funny
"Rester bouche bée" in french
The french version is "Construire des châteaux en Espagne", to build castles in Spain
It’s not exactly the persons idea that’s crazy it’s just the person is stupid
I could get by without English in Italy, Monaco, Switzerland partly, Luxembourg and Belgium, maybe close to the border in Spain as well
I live near the border with Germany
Sometimes I go there and think I can go ahead and practice my German but every other person over the border speaks pretty good French
We need to go a bit further away form the border to really need English or German
I speak German (though it's pretty rusty), so Germany and Austria should be fine, as well as the German-speaking part of Switzerland
I guess German might also come in handy in Czechia, but I'd probably default to English simply because I'm better at it
The usage of 'bah' makes you 50% french
Alright, italians are superior in that sense
Although bah sounds weird for the way italian sounds (while for french it's typical as a lot of words & expressions end with the sound of 'a')
You are right, but in pronounciation, a lot of words end with the 'a' sound despite ending with consonents
'Bois, Vois, Voix'. Or some vowel ending words like 'Toi, Loi, Moi, Va, Là' etc
Mainly did France - Switzerland
If you go through the border at Geneva they just check that you have the sticker for the highway and make you buy one if you don't.
On the other one I regularly take, sometimes there are border agents but we just slow down and never get stopped
Most of the time there is nobody
And I saw the border agents fishing in the nearby river once
Now if you’re in Strasbourg (France) you can literally just take the tramway to Germany, as they’ve extended one of the central city line recently
I always dazzled me that you can cross a border riding the tramway
I live in France, and tobacco is cheaper in Belgium, so many French people in this region go buy their cigarettes there
There's a sign telling you you're in Belgium, and my car tells me the speed limits there which is thoughtful, because otherwise I might get a ticket
There are occasional border checks for drugs and such, but on the country roads, you hardly notice you've crossed the border, except that there's suddenly better beer
I live in Strasbourg
It's the closest city to Germany
[Like you basically have to cross a bridge] and you go from Strasbourg to Kehl (German city)
We have a tramway line crossing the border
I go there once a week to buy groceries because it's cheaper
It's really that easy to go to cross the border
Occasionally there are controls but I never had one
I went to Switzerland last year : No controls
The only time I got controlled was in the train to Luxembourg
My wallpaper is also Ghibli themed
A cool fanart of Mononoke Princess I found online

On my phone it's often one of their stock photos in colours I like or a picture of Taylor Swift, depending
On my laptop it's a photo mode picture from AC Odyssey
My PC wallpaper is from Ascension
And phone is my forest
I dig Phone 2, been doing the same and I never not see it :)
Same here, I have the Debian default wallpaper since I never see it with my current window manager
Ohh Kinky, naah it’s my GF x)
I went from not liking this to loving this lol
The jokes and the cliché french accent
I'm sorry
My belgian friends I play RPGs with

Jacques Brel
r/yesyesyesno
He's both
He was created by a belgian author and he works for a belgian journal (Le Petit Vingtième), but he has a lot fo links to France
His friends are french, the iconic Moulinsart castle is french, etc
For a human sure, but we're talking about a character
The embodiment of *franco-belgian comic strips*. That's literally how anyone with some culture in the subject will call Tintin : *franco-belgian*. And a founder, so there's really nothing to be ashamed of
Who else if not Belgium ?
Germany the most I guess
Well my friends and me make a lot of jokes about Germany and France of ww1 ww2
Belgium and England
Did you know that a whale’s vagina is big enough to fit a horse in it ? Which makes it the biggest pussy after Italy in both world wars
Don’t forget England
It's not like you have a lot of other neighbors
> I don't know where this cliche comes from but apparently Belgians are pedophiles
Marc Dutroux
And you let them pass Belgium
Dammit, you always did !
Don't you dare Spain's butt ! ; )
Hmpf ! La bave du crapeau jamais n'atteint la blanche colombe ; )
It’s not loosing if you surrender
The fact that I forgot about that "country" proves that is not really significant
I doubt Spaniards have a lot of stereotypes about Andorra
Our « rivalry » with the Germans in recent times was really about the Prussian block
Tell that to the Italian
I'm in my IT classroom
Due to Covid all windows have to be open
10°c I would say
9° Here, doing some DIY  i have all my door open so, as warm as outside
Usually I will heat up in the night about 17° FR
I'm currently outside
It's 5pm and the temperature is 15°C but experienced temperature is 12°C.
Actually it's okay I'm not complaining we're used to it and like that we kept presential lessons during the second wave
What the fuck is "vin brûlé" ? It looks like it's how you call hot wine with spices in Italy, using french words ? In France we call it "vin chaud" (warm wine)
On the other hand, we use the Italian word "panini" to define one grilled sandwich
Plural "paninis"...
That's it
"Burnt wine".
Norway doesn't want to join because they don't want to stop killing whales
Recently (since the last presidential campaigns basically), the word "infox" started to arise in the classical media (TV/Radio)
It's just the fusion of two words "info" and "intox" which is an informal word for propaganda
It's on its way to replace the anglicism "fake news" which was commonly used until now
Fake news is still widely use tho, as infox is still very recent
It's the sound for fart in french (prout)
I’m pretty sure men & women won’t have the same answers here
Studied it a bit, actually
Anyway, I’m a woman in Paris: some areas are as safe as they get, others not at all
There’s no real city-large tendance
Women are frequently being harassed in Paris at night and most of them feel unsafe to walk alone at night
As a guy though I never had any problem and feel completely safe
I live in Lyon and I walked home drunk in the middle of the night and I never had an issue
I am a burly guy though so maybe other people have different experiences
There are some districts on the periphery where I would not necessarily risk it though
Créteil, France (Paris 94 suburbs)
Not safe at night, depends where in the city though
I’m living in Barcelona but originally from Marseille (~1M)  I’m a male never had an issue in BCN but I would avoid definitely Born which is full of those Moroccans teenagers without papers, they are very unstable and it is very common to get robbed by them, same goes with Gotico and Raval and apparently now Poble Sec
Now about Marseille = one of the most dangerous places in Europe
I’m 1,85 84kg male and some Algerian youngster came with a knife on me
Didn’t get hurt
I could testify an acid attack at the train station, many fights and thefts in the streets
many homophobic acts (some friend got spitted on) ... during the day the city center has many Rroma people using half naked children to beg for money
I would not recommend to go there, even for tourism
that’s a pity
It probably depends a lot on the neighborhood, no
One of my (woman) friends moved from Born to Eixample, and she said it made a massive difference in how safe she felt walking back home at night
That was one hell of a gamble, glad it worked out for you ! This guy was a good guy !
I wouldn't say Châtelet is the most dangerous station, Gare du Nord is far worse in my opinion
I would also feel unsafe by volcanoes while not erupting
I share this point of view
It’s worse than Châtelet (though the problem with châtelet is the fact that the station is _huge_: some areas are bound to be off camera, I guess
I dont think we do, but there’s the accordion stereotype
More regional than French, in Provence there is a very traditional three hole pipe called galoubet
It is played very high pitch
And is usually accompanied with a tambourin (tabor) marking the rythm
An example here:
There are regional and traditional instruments (accordion would be more for 20th century, for bal musette)
Those that are still somewhat played today are mostly present in other countries, but are associated to some regions in France too:
Biniou
Bombarde
Celtic harp
Vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy)
« D'ailleurs, j'ai horreur, de tous ces flon-flons
De la valse musette, et de l'accordéonnnnnnn»
It sounds so good
Might be my favorite instrument
Wait what
I came to say that, everytime a foreign movie has a scene set in France there is accordion music
Euhhh [excuse me]
And [this song]
Maybe we have the same instrument because we have  the same flag but not in the same direction
I think so too, but for i think an american saw one day a dude playing it in paris,  decided it was french thing and somehow everyone agreed
No mostly individual
About the song, it’s a drinking song:
« Come and have a drink at home
There's white (wine), there's red (wine) and saucisson
And Gillou with his little accordion
Long live the bottle, the friends and the songs »
Napoleon did his basic military training there
And Pope Pie VI died there
We've got a special pastry inspired by the Swiss gards during their stay
Literally every event in French history lol
The most significant one probably being the Storming of the Bastille
This makes me realize how my city historically is just a chill wealthy city
Nothing happened here
We hosted Jean Moulin when he organized the resistance and it's not even that true because he wasn't hosted in Lyon but around
Someone called Henri Deschamps hosted Jean Moulin at his house in my hometown
Now there is a commemorative plate on his house and one of the primary school is called Henri Deschamps
I live in the city where the Hermione (Lafayette's boat) was built, the boat he sailed on to go to America and fight in the civil war
A Priest seeing the archangel michael appearing to him and ordering him to build an abbey dedicated to him on a giant rock
And tadaaaaaaa Mont Saint Michel, most visited french place outside Paris !
One of the first railway of Europe (right after the english one i believe) was created from my city (Saint-Etienne) to Lyon
Bite
Yeah in french it means cock
"Bite" in French means cock or penis
"bite" - cock
"pain" - bread
"pet" - fart
Peter = to fart
Coin = corner
cave = cellar
lecture = reading
Pain = bread
store = window blind
Injure =  insulte
and many more
Don’t take Europe as one entity
Every country is different from its neighbors and people even behave differently within the same country (for example, southern french are much more friendly and talkative with strangers than northern french)
Don’t dress like the basic American tourist, and try to make an effort
If you want to ask something to some random stranger in the streets, try to go for the younger people
They most likely learned English relatively well
There’s this thing I noticed with the Americans I met : when asked where you’re from, you never say « America », but always the state and the city
It’s a bit obnoxious like we have to know your country so well that we can deduce that you’re from the US, but if I say that I come from Brest, Bretagne, I bet you couldn’t know what I talked about
So first just say that you come from the US
Just enjoy your experience without being blinded by the clichés.
Say hello before speaking to people, be polite, don't block anyone's way in the middle of the street, don't talk loudly in a restaurant/museum and I think you'll be fine
Just be polite and respectful, and embrace the local cultures with its pros and cons without comparing it to yours (at least, not aloud)
Well, i don't know exactly how things are in the USA, but remember people in Europe are busy with their own schedules and won't be necessary disposed to answer you, a tourist
I'm sure if you are polite, however, you will have great success
Trying to learn a few words in the language of the country you will visit is always a plus
People love when strangers try to talk their language, it's funny and it shows you are willing to communicate with them
Apart from Poland and Italy, is there truly any really religious country left in Europe ? :)
Even as a Frenchman, it really sometimes takes way too long
Especially when the longest meals are the family meetings I absolutely don't care about
>Even now when we eat, i'll get up immediately, and she'll just be sat
You leave her eat alone ?
France is with you on this one, sweet popcorn is obviously the way to go
> like the french
LOL
I use to live in the Netherlands and married a Dutch woman
You, Dutch people, are obsessed with having just sandwiches for lunch
I am pretty sure 90% of the world population have a warm meal for lunch, but you are the weird ones
Naaaah we got both, you liard
Yes, but the big majority eat sweet
\>american sitcom
\>someone does anything remotely sexual
\>it's badly received
\>"i-it's european"
spare me
Not really about Europe but black Americans attaching stereotypes to "white people" which are just ridiculous if you think about Europeans
Food, dancing, learning multiple languages, lack of empathy
These are all things I have seen "white people" be criticized for, and it's ridiculous, I'm not even sure if this applies to white Americans (legitimately, I don't know) but it sure as hell doesn't apply to "white people" in general
NoW It's NoT EuRopE IT's AfrIcA
Well, uh, our speech laws are still way stricter than in the US
In the US you may say anything you want without legal repercussion, except calls for violence, or false accusations
In many European countries, some political ideologies are banned, some images are banned, denying certain genocides is banned
etc
By "banned" I mean punishable by law
I'm not saying it's good to deny genocides, but I don't think it's up to politicians to say what really happened in history
That's up to history scholars
Granted though, in most of Europe we still enjoy a lot of freedom, and your average Joe rarely gets in a position where he'll say something that's considered illegal
But still, in Europe there definitely isn't free speech like in the US
This
During the 2017 election Americans pretended to care about French elections and it was so obvious to spot who was who
Both Liberals and Conservatives pick a French candidate to support and had not idea about their policies
Hearing talk-show hosts talk about the election was legitimately painful
See, I've never heard that, because our racists would say "we have so much violent crime becuase we're not homogenous enough" (we really don't have that much violent crime)
Everyone was both at some point
And that's without talking about all those who predicted the result without understanding how the election worked
I moved around a lot and it's usually black people in anglo-saxon countries/communities that think like this
Ethinic Africans/South Americans say things like this less often I found (not that they are any less critical of "white people", but at least their criticism is based on history or hatred and not ignorance)
Europe is far from being a white society too lmao
It's clear what you mean, but, there is a subtle hilarity about " I see black men about 10-15 times per day"  versus " I see about 10-15 black men per day" lol .
It's the coverage from John Oliver that I was thinking about when I wrote my comment
Although his was not that bad IIRC
> Also fine if female has male nipple stickers on her nipples
wat
Exactly I live near Luxembourg and hating Portuguese people seems to be the norm
Well yeah that’s what I meant lmao .you guys are more racist toward French than toward Portuguese
Wow . Honestly I get that they want to be fully french and I think it's okay but they just seems like asshole giving up on their family like that . Personally I have italian family and although I consider myself 100% french (I actually even refused to take the double nationality) I still go and see them very often and I don't compare their country to France and they're still my family
And they don't mind the fact that I don't consider myself italian and still consider me as their family
I have no idea I guess there is a lot of Portuguese people but honestly it’s stupid they don’t cause trouble or anything
Yeah idk why people would bully people for being of portuguese descent kids are retarded
It's weird 'cause portuguese people are like the only european people who really suffer hard racism in modern france
Idk I’d never assume something about so many people
In Paris, 25 sqm in the city centre (district 1 to 10), 30 to 45 in the outer circle (11 to 20)
In you want 45 sqm, there's probably no elevator, though
Haute-savoie (alps)
My village, 100-150m² (so 4 to 6 rooms) with possibly a great view on the mountains
But we are not as touristic as other places around, so going 10-20km from there will make the prices double or triple
I live in the countryside, I don't know about flats but this is definitely enough to buy a relatively big house (total of 3 "floors," your regular floor, one that is downstairs and one that is upstairs) with a garden
I don't live in a place that tourists dream of going to lol
100m2 house on 800m2 with up to date insulation, heat pump etc
A comfortable place 30km from Bordeaux city center
Ok I've just checked official statistics: 37% of apartments in Paris don't have an elevator (in 2016)
Lots of place do, but there's a remaining 15/20% building without
Every room where you could put a bed or a sofa bed into and that has its own window
Living room, bedrooms, study, etc
Dining room too, if separated from the kitchen
Ok, I found my new place
Stay away from Paris
It sucks
Instead, visit Nice, Strasbourg, Nantes, Monaco, Quimper, Arcachon
I remembe the umbrella girls from the year I lived in Krakow, they were every-fucking-where around Rynek Glowny, even during daytime, asking people in front of family
I've never took them myself but i've always wondered if the horse carriage city tours were scams
Other than that, great country, great people, great food :)
Yeah, and the wands don't even work
Let alone the nimbus 2000s
I’ve also heard the people selling beers on the beach store their beers in the sewers
is this true ?
Paris is far from sucking
When compared to other major French cities it's true that Paris is not the most pleasant place to be, if you come to France to just have a good time and have a taste of French life then I agree there's better places than Paris for that
But if you come for the architecture or the cultural offer then Paris is a no-brainer
Lyon for instance is an awesome place with plenty to see, but with two days you'll have basically seen everything the city has to offer, you can push to 4 days if you want to spend time in museums or really take things slow
4 days in Paris you'll have barely scratch the surface and what you'll see will be in an order of magnitude way above similar offers in other cities
I would never want to live in Paris, nor wish it to my worst enemy, but the Paris bashing is a bit tiring
I'll advise tourists coming in France to check their expectations and be sure about what they want to do, then Paris may not be the best destination and a "road trip" around the country could be better suited
But crossing out Paris out of the blue could be a big mistake
Did you get dumped in paris or something
Paris is a big city and for some that can be a bit off putting but few places in the world can rival the cultural density of Paris
Museums and monuments are worth at least a week of a tourists time IMO and they’ll be left with still plenty to do if they stay longer
Telling people to stay away is simply absurd
That being said other cities in France have a lot to give as well and are often a bit overlooked by tourists sadly
My favorite ‘hidden gem’ is Metz
I love the view of the cathedral you get from the other side of the Moselle when the sun sets
Also awesome train station
Paris c'est nul point barre
Security, scenery, royal palace
I see ! I was thinking it might be a quite effective (but disgusting) way of selling constantly fresh beers
It would take about 10 days to spend 10 seconds in front of each of everything at the Louvres
Most tourist don't see a tenth of what is actually exposed
Locals even less
(about a hundred hours and it's opened nine hours a day)
Which is a Japanese thing due to their cultural image of Paris that make them believe it is all like Amelie Poulain movie
A westerner never had Paris syndrome
It's not just disappointment, it's hallucinations, delirium, feeling of persecution, tachycardia etc
It's an actual psychological issue
Similar phenomenon exists for Jerusalem which has mostly archeological traces from after the 11th century, far from the holiness expectations of some people
Yes, it's almost exclusively among Asian tourists
The over-romanticizisation of Paris in Asian media and the strong cultural shock between Europe and Asia are mainly to blame
Paris first remains a big western city, and a really busy one
It's understandable that people who were being mislead to see it as a magical amusement park live it as a jarring experience once you add the jet lag and being, for some, the first time in a very foreign environment
Dandelions in French are called pissenlit
Literally pee-in-bed, because they make it easier for you to pee
Chauve-souris in France, means bald mouse
How do you say "hot dog"?
Everybody is speaking and writing English lmao
ni povas paroli en Esperanto se homoj preferas
Estas lacaj de la angla kiel internacia lingvo
La angloj forlasas la Eŭropan Union, La usonanoj pli kaj pli konsistas ... kial ni devas plu paroli la anglan
C'est pas faux
Automatically translated
is that a thing
I would be interested in an automatic translator
It's very science fiction
Looks like the Belgian r/rance
Using "submarine" for "subreddit" has become a meme on its own in r/france after an auto-translated post by some tourist
The sub already had a craving for litteral translations of everything, so this fits perfectly
r/rance litterally translates to *rancid*, I've always liked the name
I just wished it'd be r/ance (rance) because now we got AirFrance and Errance
Same in France
Street level is called "rez-de-chaussée" (pronounced rey de sho-say)
It comes from old French i think, but basically it means right-next-to-street
Then the next level is first floor, then second floor, etc
This is funny because the fact that different language use different words, all the problem could come from people counting different things !
English count the floors and French count the "étages", and an étage is by definition something above the floor
So English count levels, and French count stages of a building sort of
I am sure there is other example in other languages
rez is cognate with raz, meaning 'level'
Oh like a group of flower ? We say "un parterre de fleurs" here sometimes
Oh like a group of flower ? We say "un parterre de fleurs" here sometimes
Les frères Lumière invented Cinema
The guillotine haha
Fries are a Parisian invention bro
Beer is not a German invention xD
The car, the television and the computer are not exclusive german inventions though
Same goes for the beer (from babylon), the paper (China), lightlub (Joseph swan from uk), telephone (Bell from USA), you invented the bismark healthcare, but there is also the beveridgie healthcare (Uk) etc

The department where Lille is located is just called "North" simply because
it's at the North of France
In France too, there are dozens of place names that include "[Villeneuve]
It was named like that because back then people were not speaking french, or identifying with France, that much
We were Flemish and the department (not exactly same borders but close) was called "Province de Flandre" before the revolution
In 1790 the Parisian administration named us "Departement du Nord" in an attempt to remove the historical bond of local people to the flemish culture and to make them more French
In the 19th century speaking French was seen as high class while Flemish was seen as the language of the masses and the "uneducated farmers". In the early 20th century only a few farmers were still speaking flemish as a first language
In Dunkirk we still use a lot of words that comes from flemish in our local dialect, but there's barely anyone left that does speaks flemish there
The massive campaign of the government to forbid the use of local languages in the area in the 19th and early 20th century worked well
Elderly from my family told me once that in the 1920s there were big signs in school that said "forbidden to speak flemish" and if students were caught they were getting punished (back then they had physical punishments allowed at school, so they were basically beaten up by their teachers
And now the whole new region is called "Haut-de-France", in the vote we had also the possibility of "Flandre-Artois-Picardie" which I'll have preferred (FAP region lol), but I guess it will have been too empowering of historical local identities
In order to lesser the identities in both Departments, they called them Pyrénées Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees) and Pyrénées Atlantiques (Atlantic Pyrenees) while they are the "French" counterparts to Euskara and Catalonia
As well as the whole region « Hauts de France » (Upper France)
I was thinking more of [Neuville]
Terres du nord frère !
I don't understand the uproar
What's wrong in saying hosts are liable for copyright
I might be too old :)
It's bad, but it's almost like the end of the world according to reddit
Some think that this vote will make people vote for eurosceptic parties and, around me, I really don't know anyone who cares that much, and I don't see them vote for such parties only on the basis of that vote

I don't think I've ever seen anyone eating pizza with sauce (as in dipping)
not garlic or tomato but more very spicy sauces
I have no qualms putting Maggi sauce over every kind of food and call it cooking
But pizza
you crossed a line there
Pro: high variety of awesome fine food, good wine is cheap, big variety of beautiful places to see, contrary to the stereotype people are mostly alright, good public healthcare and safety net
Con: you have to plan your movements around strikes, we have around 9% unemployment
Pros: food, healthcare, places to see
&#x200B;
Cons: worst education system in Europe imo (stress is through the roof, too many hours, self-teaching is better), we complain over ANYTHING, strikes everywhere all the time
Tbh, I don't really like this place
Pros: pretty, a lot of culture and history, big for Europe with varied landscapes, high standards for schools, pretty good living standards, delicious food, good food and social culture, pretty language
Cons: politics are getting worse every year, lots of unresolved social issues, too centralized around Paris, expensive for Europe
Genuine question : is too much light an issue ?
Cons : High taxes and bad public services on average for what we pay
Shit educative system
Too much differences between Paris and the rest
Bad broadband in the countryside
People complaining for nothing
Corrupt politicians
There is literally no pros to living in France to you or you are just adding to my comment
A strong lightbulb is not in the same ballpark as natural light
I’m just adding to your comment
France is a nice country to live in
It could just be much better
So much potential yet so much delusion
I love my country don’t worry
USSR/Russia : Katyusha, My army, Polyushka Polye, Farewell of slavianka
Germany (including GDR and GFR) : Der offene Aufmarsh, Erika, "Unterwegs, Soldaten, Marsh
", Wo alle Straßen enden
South Korea : Torch of communism eradication, Arirang nation
North Korea : No motherland without you, Defend headquarter of revolution, My country is the best, The answered soldier, We pledge, We know nobody but you, One against a hundred, People call and follow him, Chollima on the wing
Cuba : Hasta siepre Che Guevara, Cuba my love
The russian "We need only one victory" : [
I like the italian revolutionary song Bella Ciao
Outside of American marches, I am fond of a Romanian patriotic song : "Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire", which means "On our flag is written Union".
Link to the YouTube video : [
I hope it will interest someone
edit: a grammar error
I vow to thee my country from the english is maybe one of my favorite but if someone can explaine me the background of this song, i'll be very pleased
Listen to the Tuva Republic anthem, it is really amazing !
I adore Hatikvah and I hate that it’s seen as glorification or supporting of Israeli government or any of their policies
It was written in the 1800s as an important and heartfelt declaration of a people persecuted and forced into exile and broken into a wide diaspora, yearning to be free to be together again in their ancestral land
Now every time I heard it I’m reminded of the stories of people being forced to march to their deaths in the Shoah, still singing Hatikvah and yearning for the survival and freedom of their people
So glad I’m not the only one
Another fun fact, Brittany loves so much the welsh anthem (well, the welsh culture as well), we share the same tune
[Welsh anthem]
[Breton anthem]
Yup can confirm, thanks to the 6 Nations I can listen to Celtic anthems I'd never know else and the Irish, Welsh and Scottish anthems sound really great (even the British one but I'm not allowed to say this)
Yup sounds even better when 80000 people are singing it in the stadium, same for all other Celtic anthems (and I have to admit I like the English one too but I can't say this in public that's a secret)
Yeah the DDR anthem is clearly the best of the two
Do you know "Defend the HQ of the Revolution"? Legitimately intimidating North Korean song
Haha, true
We really disliked the Austrians during the french revolution
Translation for those who wonder:
**Verse 1:**
*Let's go children of the fatherland,*
*The day of glory has arrived
*Against us stand tyranny*
*The bloody flag is raised
(repeat)*
*In the countryside, do you hear*
*The roaring of these fierce soldiers
*They come right to our arms*
*To slit the throats of our sons, our wife
**Chorus:**
*Grab your weapons, citizens
*Form your battalions
*Let's march
Let's march
*May an impure blood*
*Water our fields
Hahaha, it's brillant !
Thank you for the share, I love it !
Yup, I had an Israeli roommate in the US who identified as European and the first time I thought it was far-fetched
Thankfully I ultimately don't care but I remember it as a surprising "wait what did he just said ?" moment in my head
The big windstorm of 1997
I was born the next century but trees still haven't regrown up
My department has still a big part of its forests destroyed
The [eruption of Montagne Pelée] in 1902: the biggest city in the Martinique island, Saint-Pierre, was completely destroyed, 30
000 people died
I suspect in England everybody’s imagination is still captured by the Titanic and the film hardly stemmed the morbid fascination with it
I'd suggest watching this [*Perfect Storms* episode] for those that want to learn more about it
Aren't you talking about the "Lothar" storm of 1999
It was so violent that it blew off the chimney on top of our roof
Huge, but is that one well known
I don’t really think so, I’ve told people who did not even know the mont pelée existed about it countless times
I think it was named after the volcano rather than after the event :) But I do know of that
What I meant is that in France what happens in the ultra-marine territories is (sadly) not well known, at all
I’m therefore not sure that’s our most famous catastrophe
Especially since (but those might be out of the question asked by OP
) the Bataclan events are known much better, as well as the explosion of a factory in Lyon
Onion soup : rarely eaten, mostly in winter at ski stations, in some counrty side or in tourist restaurants
I had it twice in my life and know many people who had never taste it
Snails: we do it them but those who eat them only have it like for christmas and maybe once in spring
Many had never tried
Same with frogs
Croissant: I mean we do have some regulary (often for a foreigner point of view), but it's definitely not the normal breakfast
It's a treat for some lazy Sundays
Crepe: same, we don't have crepe for breakfast like you can make some pancakes, it's too much work (you can be satisfied with 2 or 3 pan cakes, but not with crepe)
It's a treat
Baguette: well, we do have bread everyday but many, especially in the country side would have an other kind of bread with a different shape (traditional or campagne): better taste and last longer
But some people still have a baguette almost every day
Wine: while elders traditionaly have a glass of wine for lunch/diner no matter what, it's not a thing anymore, it's more like for a diner with friends/family or at restaurant
In foreign (especially british and american) movies, people like to go back home and have a big glass of wine after a hard day, that's not really a thing here, we have it while eating
Most would have nothing or a beer or something similar
Cheese: we don't... wait
Actually, we do it a lot of cheese
never mind
I am part of the 10% then
Regarding French dishes that we do not eat that often, what I have never eaten and will never eat, is snails
And I may have eaten frog legs two times in my life, and one of these times has been outside of France
La choucroute garnie is indeed considered a typical Alsatian dish in France, but eaten throughout the country
I am personaly not a great fan of cabbage, and even less of fermented cabbage
Leaving the bread upside down on the table brings bad luck
\-The bread put on the wrong face is either a symbolic of upcoming death ( royal hangmans used to do so ) or a call for the devil
\-Seeing the shape of a white ghost lady by night while driving means you will have a deadly accident
\-In Brittany, hearing weird creaking sounds by night can be the Ankou ( evil demon, looks like a skeleton with local outfit ) coming with his undead horse
\-You don't say "good luck" to someone preparing for something important because it brings misfortune
"Bonne merde" ( "good shit" ) is better, it's related to old era where an opera can tell if they a lot of customer because of the amount of shit they brought on the floor
>* if you hick up that meas someone is speaking about you that moment
We have something similar but with tinnitus

Street harassment
All the female friends I know, have been confronted by men either following them to ask their numbers or cat whistled
I even know a few who would take an Uber to come home at night when they could actually walk for 20mn to arrive at their places
It's a serious problem, and of course a lot of men are somehow getting offended to be told that you can't bother a woman walking on a street
All the women I know who moved either to Canada or Germany told me it was a great relief compared to France, as they felt safe at last going out at night
Street harassment when you are a young woman
I lived near "la défense", a place that is supposed to be safe, because it is the business district of Paris
There are few inhabitants, we mostly meet workers during the day
&#x200B;
Yet in one year, I had been followed seven times
&#x200B;
My worst experience was a return from a festival (I saw macklemore at the sollidays) around 6am in the subway
3 young men came to me and proposed me an after-party at their house, I ignored them
At the terminus, I hurried to go out in order  to avoid them
After five minutes, an RATP agent (underground) grabbed my arm and said "*follow me*". He brought me into the RATP office and made me meet several of his colleagues
They were as confused as me
I asked him what I was doing here
He replied "*So, I can see that you are still a little bit drunk and I think you didn't understand what was going on
I heard several men talking about you, they were planning to follow you".*
\- "*Oh yes, I remember these 3 guys
They talked to me in the underground
He answered me with a grave voice: "*There were not three men, madam
I counted eight
&#x200B;
The next day, I bought myself a pepper spray
And I never go out without it
&#x200B;
Edit: I corrected some errors :/
We suck so hard at English it's tough to find cinemas airing original versions outside of big cities
Not a major problem, but can be annoying when you really dislike dubbed movies
Never EVER tell you salary in France, especially if you win more than 2000e. It's pretty taboo to speak about that
The 'Hatred of the "rich" ' is pretty strong here, jealousy is rampant
Personnaly I don't care one bit if you're making more than me , that good for you but a lot of people (mostly on the far-left of the political spectrum) can hate you and / or may agress you because of that
Also people always saying that our country is shit
We're not without problem but holy duck, if you listen to them you would think we're a third-rate country
Wages are extremely low compared to other Western countries
The cost of the health system is not justified by its quality, others do better and cheaper but some still believe that the service at this price is satisfactory
That we have the highest taxation in the world (45% of GDP)
How is it in the summer ? You get way more sunshine than central Europe right ?
You should get a luminotherapy lamp
Makes wonders
Even for guys it's a relief
I live in Germany (not that I didn't liked France, but got a job opportunity and decided to move), and it feels so safe compared to France that's insane
You can go to a bar, left your jacket and bag on a chair, then go play pool for like one hour, and when you come back everything is still there, untouched
(Speaking about Berlin)
You never get bothered in the streets, at night or whatever
No fights in clubs, you can go party with your gf and you don't need to be constantly next to her
You can let her dance by herself without getting directly harrassed by a bunch of dudes
Idk if I'll be able to live in France again, you get used very fast to the safety of Germany
C'est choquant de prendre un Uber au lieu de marcher 20 minutes seul dans la nuit ? Je suis un mec et ça me paraissait normal
Good boy !... but you forgot manspreading, feminicide, difference of salaries, etc
You don't learn enough of what TV tells you
The truth is that women like men get messed with in different area
The mentality to think that everything revolves around women and only women is sickening
The most absurd to me about that whole stance is that it claims to be inspired by feminism, with the will to fight against misogyny and machism, while it's inspired of it and renforces it, since it's based on the same principe : " women are weak and need protection".
What is even funnier, is that it's a mentality mostly exclusively shared among heterosexual mens
If you discuss the matter with hetero women, lesbian, homosexual men, none of them believe that about women and who are generaly regarded has manipulative bitch, which is the female counter point of men being violent cunt
Wow, in Sweden ?
One of your stereotyp is to be one of the most "social progress" happy country on earth
>but a lot of people (mostly on the far-left of the political spectrum) can hate you and / or may agress you because of that
Yeah, then they'll burn your kids and drink your blood
Seriously bro
This is a good answer for today in particular
Last time I looked into it, the consensus among the experts in France was that part of these men were after the thrill of making women feel threatened (as it made them feel powerful), and the rest were just extremely lonely people with little to no experience with women
I also remember a piece from a journalist, who made the experiment of going and talking with the men who were catcalling her, and they were mostly sad individuals: the moment she talked to them you could see all their confidence crumble, and those who accepted to be interviewed eventually admitted that they had no idea how to actually engage with women, and that they never met women in a social setting
(btw that is an explanation, not an excuse)
I didn't know Portugal was suffering from the same issue
Sorry for you :/
I ain't a sociologist-anthropologist, but here are my two cents:
I don't think it is so much related to a hormones problem than a cultural one
We've been educated in France (at least, from my point of view) with the idea that freedom of speech is sacred
Hence why there was such an amount of support for Charlie Hebdo after the attacks of 2015
That being said, the cons of this line of thinking, is to tend to think that if a conflict erupts because of something you just said, the culprit would be the recipient not the emitter
To give you an idea, the word "offensive" is pretty much non existent in the French language when talking about verbal or oral speeches
So basically, there's not just a firm conviction in freedom of speech, but a collective sense of entitlement and a complete insensibility to its consequences
Not all of us act this way, but one's got to notice that this mindset is way more present in our country that in others
For me, street harassment is an extension of this issue
Men go after women because they feel its their own right to address anyone in public spaces, especially if said person is hot enough to make a move
They just never compute even once that they can in the best case scenario annoy women, nor do they consider what it would feel like if they were in their shoes
White French men typically like to use migrants or Muslim as culprits for these issues, but the reality is that there ain't a specific demographic group who's reponsible
That being said, depending on the age and social class, there will be different manners to approach a woman, but at the end of the day it remains the same problem
This is just bullshit and quite old now
It comon harassment like you'll find in any big city
Yes painfull but inherently come with condensing big population in small area
They tried to bring awarness to this "menace", but did quite a flop
This mostly concern Paris, but the issue is that when media went there, teh one doing it were mostly immigrant more or less illegal
Lets say bad press for the left cityhall
After that you had a girl whos video went viral after a guy threw at her an ashetray, this was great the guy looked white on the videos, but when he got caught, police realised that it was crazy person
I guess no one can settle on what neoliberalism means, but at least on r/neoliberal, they're *constantly* calling for more housing to be built and rail against restrictions which limit new construction ([example] And I agree with them -- I think most housing shortages are caused by government limitations making building difficult and unprofitable (*edit*), and by established property owners who lobby the government to set those limits
I'm talking about things like zoning laws, height restrictions, rent control, mandatory built-in parking, not-in-my-backyards (NIMBYs) who don't want the "character" of their neighborhood to change, or who don't want their property value to go down, etc
Well, that what happened to me, and a few more people  i know as well
Maybe it's only we're i live, maybe it's just me, but that what happened around me
And despite that and being a night owl, I still dream of moving to Stockholm
(hey, I actually like the rythm of that sentence !)
yeah, once I was partying with some female friends, and one guy offered a beer to one of them
She had the drink directly handed to her without really having any room to refuse it, she looked at me and was like "I'm not gonna drink that" and moved on to just leave it on some table
I was kind of a bit drunk already and I just took the beer and said that if she wasn't gonna drink it then I will because, well, free beer
Damn, it made me pretty drunk/sick, and the morning after I had the worst headache I ever had, lasted two days and ibuprofen was almost useless, felt like shit
I dunno if it was something from that drink but I highly suspect it because I've never been that hungover from beers, and I had some heavy drinking many times
>The mentality to think that everything revolves around women and only women is sickening
That's media propaganda driven by some americain "liberal" lobbies
France is now infested by those since Holland and Berger era
The issue is that, that kind of mentality is percieved in France has communautarism more or less diguise and is in total opposition of our historical universalism vision of humanism
For example before that, dangerous neighbourhoods, the ones where the gentlemen I respond too for examples takes place, were caused by uneducation, pauverity and/or immigration, depending of political view
Now it's caused for media by men
The thing is, the people who are not confronted to it believe media bullshit, the one who are just vote extremist parties who still blames immigration
Well they'll glady tell you they're aware, and even declared "fighting sexism" as the number one mission of their office term, but at the same time their actions are only for show
The budget allocated to equality issues is ridiculous, especially compared to other countries
Probably Brittany
A bit too proud of their own region but pretty nice people overall
Connemara is also really liked in France
I would have said la Réunion, afaik they don't really have any cliché about them, the reputation is pretty fine and all, their food is considered good, most of everybody I know consider them nice
And they don't go everywhere shake a flag to be seen even if it doesn't make sense
(Tbh I kinda like that, but hey)
Do they dislike them a bit in Normandy ? My brain can't really accept that they are anyone in France that is not hated at least a bit by another Frenchman .
i know that place only because of "that" song
À l'aise Breizh
Si seulement c'était le Kroaz du et pas ce plagiat du drapeau américain
Enfin des gens qui savent que le Gwenn da hu c'est de la merde
My brother lives in Warsaw and lately he complains that he has to take his car battery home every day, otherwise it dies overnight
It's crazy that it's so cold in Warsaw now (not insane cold like in Yakutsk but still, a solid -12˚C), and here it Lyon we had like +15˚C last Saturday, when it looked like we were on Mars due to the Sahara sand
It's like a 2 hours flight between the two cities
We have some legacy database with keys in French, the rest of the codebase is french-rigid english, so are comments and documentation
I write everything in english: code, comments, and commit messages
Programmers who use french are usually seen as inexperienced
Is that a brand new 2020 joke ?
And it comes from an Italian ?
"all french i've ever met", "exclusively able", "nothing else", "such pricks", "very angry"… Another Italian found red-handed exagerating ?
Come on bro, not even a single one ? Even arrogant French people would give more credit to Italy
I feel like it got better in France
It was considered super cheap and low quality, it's still considered cheap but it's much more socially acceptable to go there IMO
In France Lidl is seen as the bottom of the bottom
The place where homeless people go
When you go to Lidl you feel like you failed at life
Horrible products, bad quality
It's cheap, but the reasoning is important
They chose to have little products but they buy in bulk
So it's good product, but they leave the floor pallet board and don't care too much about the presentation
I don't shop there, but last time I was in one, there was a soldering mask, it was hilarious
It's seen as cheap shit, a store selling producs of very low quality
It's low end, the lowest of the low
And it's not even that cheap compared to the rest
Yes, but it's still as a "low-cost" brand, just not a terrible one
I kinda get the feeling that it's still shit tiers (the prepared food seems awful, tried a pizza once, never again), but increasing precarity of our population made it acceptable
Picard is pretty good IMO, a bit pricy tho
I personally really like it
I think they have variety and good products, for both ingredients and pre-made meals
I find it very convenient to have nice meals available with almost no preparation needed, that you can basically keep in your freezer for as long as you need
I wish I had a bigger freezer to store a lot more
It's not necessarily more expensive than at supermarkets (at least where I live), and they also have good budget stuff
I suspect that's because they don't have a lot that they throw away, since everything is frozen anyway
Picard is great
I shop there all the time and it’s sometimes hard to believe some of their stuff is frozen food
There's one in the my department, never went there, never will i imagine
Didn't even knew it existed
I wouldn't know, I haven't bought from Findus in a while (they don't have their own stores that I know of, Findus is one of the many brands you find in supermarkets)
Definitely
Yes we can
It would be weird otherwise
Yeah they can, there is a few people thinking that they cant but they’re a minority
Well, back in the days when you still had a landline and no caller id, French were saying "Allo".
Now with smartphones, if it is a known number I either just say allo or  answer something like "hey [insert caller's name], what's up
If it is an unknkown number, I let it go to voicemail
"Allô ?"
Then common greetings, and then you start to talk
I still say "Oui, allô ?" a lot
I still say "Allô ?" every time someone answers, because it's quicker than "hey why are you calling me"
Don't you ever say "hallod
I say it the other way around « allô oui
». But only if I don’t know the number
Is the caller is on private, then I let them go to voicemail
Absolutely no other other use of Allo than picking up the phone
You may use allo as a passive agressive way to request attention from someone, but it is, let's say, directly derived from the phone usage
That's so impolite
Better hope it's not an important call XD
Köszönöm a felvilágosítást :)
The French Kingdom exists since Clovis I coronation at Reims, baptizing the kingdom to the christian church, which was on Christmas of 496
The actual name of our country now is "République française" so French republic, and that exists since the 22 september of 1792, the first day of the first republic
It depends
496 was when the Franks started blobbing in Western Europe ; 843 was when they fucked up their succession lawq and West Francia (Future France) was created
I mean, it's not that hard to take Primogeniture smh
around 500 i think, after the fall of the Roman Empire maybe
Officially 1792, but it's actually a bit more complicated
"France" is a very generic term that was used on many occasions but did NOT referred to the same entity
The Kingdom of France is not the same thing as the French Republic (despite having mostly the same land and people)
France is also not the same thing as Francia or Frankish Empire
As of today, we are the French Republic, not the Kingdom of France
As such, it was founded in 1792, during the French Revolution
You can be even more precise, as 1792 refers to the First Republic
We are actually at the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958
The Kingdom of France is old, and the Frankish Empire even older, you can travel back to \~1500 years
you guys are pure vikings
To go in further detail
The start of it being called The Kingdom of France (as opposed to "Kingdom of the Franks", which is still what Germans call us, guess they never got that memo) is under Philippe-Auguste in the late 12th century, with 1204 often being seen as the key date, because the official documents which officialized Normandy's attachment to the kingdom call it "The Kingdom of France".
If you want to be more nitpicky and just look at the current regime, then your date is 1958
either 816 or 62 years old
Vercingétorix  in -52 ?
Charlemagne is not seen as France's founding father
We just question the notion that he was more German than French (he was neither), but the "founder" of France would either be Clovis or Philippe-Auguste, depending on how you look at it
It did
Two different monarchies actually
It was also first an Empire under Napoleon I, then again under Napoleon III, then it was no longer a Republic (just a "State") under Pétain
The XIXth Century really was mostly Empires for France, with some monarchies and a brief Republic (1848-1852) before the IIIrd Republic settled in the 1870s.
There's really no possible way to claim Vercingétorix has anything to do with France really, aside from living in a place that would later be part of it
He's as French as Caesar is Italian, which is to say not at all (though "Italian" actually existed as a word during Caesar's time, so maybe not the best comparison now that I think of it)
Clovis is the farthest back you can possibly go, and even that is stretching it quite a bit
He was never crowned and died in exile in Austria
Napoleon III was his nephew and skipped his number out of respect
Same story with Louis 18, his nephew who would have been Louis 17 was never crowned and died in jail as a child
"If you believe it then it can fit", a famous saying in my family, usually said when going to ikea with a single car
Renting once or twice a year a truck to get this kind of stuff is way way way cheaper than buying a truck
So when I do to DIY, I go with renting
And by the way, drywall are not so common in europe, at least in france
If this don't fit in the car, you can rent a truck or a van at every supermarket (Carrefour, Leclerc, Auchan)
And if you buy at IKEA for example, they have a delivery service
Most people just open the trunk so the stuff can fit and they attach it
It's not like I need big items everyday, if I ever need any I just get them delivered at home by the store or rent a van for a couple hours if it's not possible
The lack of popularity of pickup trucks in Europe also stems from cultural aspects
First of all, it's about fashion
«bulky» stuff is not appreciated here, «bigger is better» is not valued in Europe
Just look at car designs from the past decades and you will see American cars look nothing like European ones, probably because US roads are wider, given that space is not a problem over there
I also think having a truck appeals to the American value of mobility, when it's expected to quickly uproot yourself and move to another state on the other side of the continent
Europe doesn't have that mentality, even though it has started to change with how the EU evolves
I know a lot of people owning a van
And you can rent one too quite easily
Deliveries are sometimes free for bulky and expensive items (like couches)
\- On the car's roof or inside with the seats folded and the car boot door open
\- rent a van, it's about 40 euros for a day
\- delivery, it's not that expensive (I paid 70 euros for my big sofa) and they take your old stuff back
\- borrow or rent a van from someone else (you have lots of app for  neighbour  to help each other like: I use your van for a morning, in exchange you can use my drill or give your kid maths lessons)
\- If you want to donate some old big fournitures, some charity associations can come to take it with their own truck
I renovate houses in France countryside without a car (or licence) i get everything delivered at once
Like "guibot mat" here ibn Normandy
Once you plan everything it's pretty simple but you need a place stock them
Last time I did 9T gravel, 300m² of insulation 350m² of plaster board and it costed 0€ for it
Better get some friends to help
"Tout peut être un godemiché, si l'on est assez courageux"

Haut vote pour la référence
They have van rentals and fuel stations, like most other french supermarkets
Most of them are also getting equiped with drives (order your groceries on internet) and proximity carrefours are on Uber eats
Merci, merci
Je finirai simplement par dire que j'aime mettre mon pénis dans un yaourt
I don't think anyone on either side of the Atlantic really considers Quebec as french
We have the same language but they are their own thing
It's like England and Australia
They're not really considered french or part our culture, they're seen as our cousins from Canada with a funny accent
They are North Americans\* who speak French, the cultural barrier is pretty much there
We do share a common history and plenty of French people live and work there though
We are closer to them in some way than other French speaking countries around the globe (not counting Belgium or Switzerland which are right next door)
The language has become its own thing, it's French but absorbed a lot of English into it, just like the French spoken in Western Africa absorbed a lot of local languages
It's somehow hard for the untrained French ear to grasp everything that's being said
They are an old colony the English stole, we will take it back one day, and reinstate de King of France, and live just like the good old days
Vive le Québec libre
For real though, as a French who lived 4 years in Quebec, I can say that except for the language, we barely have anything in common, but it’s not a bad thing
We like each others
If for exemple a French tourist is visiting Thailand, and see a Quebecois tourist, they will most likely have a conversation and a drink, because we have this link, we’re cultural cousin
Je vous aime les Quebs, gros bec
They are our cousins from the other side of the pond, Quebec and Quebecois have an extremely positive image in France, I think I really never heard anything negative about Quebec in the everyday chit-chats, there are even some people who developed a kind of fascination for Quebec
I think the Quebecois' opinion about France and the French is more nuanced, for historical reasons of course (we kind of a abandoned them to their fate)
There is a bunch of Quebecois artists who regularly expand their audience to France, because, well, a 60 million audience pays better than a 8 million audience
I have no idea if French artists actively seek to be present in Quebec
I know some went back and forth like standup comedian Gad Elmaleh
Really positive about it, I really like the diversity of the french language
Althought I have the feeling that Quebec people are more used to hear french from france than French are used to hear french from quebec
I feel like I'm saying french/france a lot in this comment but I cannot do much about it
Love Québec but I definitely feel culturally closer to countries like Germ\*ny or Engl\*nd, Québec is closer to Canada to it is to France
I read somewhere that the Quebecois accent many people make fun of could be in fact the way people used to talk in France in the early 1600'.
Hehe, it's funny because the Brits genuinely think Australian culture is close to British culture
Little do they know
This is an old Normand accent, more or less
They're not looked down upon at all, the accent is considered funny but that's it
Lol, what a weird dude
True, true, but they will say "bullshit" (connerie), "joke " (blague), "nice" (sympa), their group of friends is a "gang" and on Friday nights they go to "parties" (fêtes)
Also they use a lot of expressions that are direct translations from English and that don't really make sense for a Frenchman
Saying "c'est correct" is translated from "it's okay", "bienvenue " for "you are welcome " .
Quebequois often pride themselves in being a dam against the prevalence of the English language and will taunt the French by saying that we incorporated a shitton of English words in our language,  which is true (eventhough those English words have been bastardized by the French users and usually make zero sense for an English speaker)
But the Quebequois are direct neighbors to the US and their English speaking citizens in Canada, so of course the way they talk is directly influenced by the English language
For me it's really the use of English words (said with perfect English accent) that I find off-putting, my brain has a hard time to understand the mix of the two languages
In France when we say an English word it's with a thick French accent, it has almost become a French word at this point
Because as an American you are used to stressed words
French québécois is like old french with english stresses, so I guess for you it would sound more natural than for us
Yes, long overdue my dear Rosbif
Bwahahaha, I just spent 1
5 year working there, after 15 years in London, and you’re totally delusional mate
I know you’re told about great empire stories, and to be fair Australians like to keep the link alive, but it’s a very very different culture
The way they interact and behave is on the opposite end of the cultural spectrum, if you’re interested I can tell you more
I heard some Flemings can speak a couple words in French once they notice you're French and not Walloon
Indeed, they have plenty of funny cursed words centered around religion, which is not a thing in France
It’s Jeanne d’Arc you moose
Nounou (pronounced noo-noo in English) is probably the more commonly used term
Babysitter in France usually implies a short term thing, like watching the kids for an evening occasionally, whereas the nounou takes care of your kids daily for an extended period of time
Does tata means anything
Because in french it means aunty
Ah interesting
We call that “tétine” (probably from téton, meaning nipple)
(Or "téter," to suckle)
As weird as it sounds, No cooking class in France ! Sometimes we might go out with the school to learn how to make some bread or some jam basic stuff
But the cooking is to be learnt at home !
Not at all
I remember baking classes at the rec center in summer
And it was more for fun than for learning
No, that sounds very odd
Actually until now I thought cooking classes in school were like super weird
Like
why ?
My parents taught me basic cooking, sewing, and how to use tools
It was only very basic (my mum doesn't like to cook, and for everything else they wouldn't have thought to teach me if I didn't ask about it - mainly because they themselves *had* classes on these subjects as kids) and I learned most of the "advanced" stuff by myself when I was a student
I'm still lucky since even in primary and middle school I had noticed that lot of my classmates had never used a screwdriver
It's basic life skills that everyone should know, no reason to not learn it at school (especially since my CE1 teacher would make lessons about things like "how to fill a check"... Why that and not other useful skills that are not taught in school
Well some school have people from the outside come and do some intervention about eating well
But no school program about how to eat properly
We have maybe a few classes about activities or we learn about calories and that you don't have too eat too much but not specific programs
The way a child learns about nutritionism is exclusively at home, like for me I know my parents made us eat a certain way that I thought was a good one but actually wasn't that great
But yeah I mean in France we eat generally  good i'd say
but like everywhere some people can't afford to eat well
Sorry to disappoint :/
Read my other comment
I am against it
A good part of integrating well into the country is by frequenting people of the country
If you don't speak the language you will only be able to frequent people from your country of origin and I feel like we have way too much of that already
I'm going to say it depends on the situation
If the country in question offers support and lessons to said person to learn the language then I believe they should speak the language to ask for citizenship since an entire system has been created to support people moving in
I am currently facing this problem with my husband
France has a great system in place allowing foreigners to learn French and providing lessons to them which I find to be a great initiative
Except it doesn't apply to Europeans
And since the UK is still kinda in Europe, he can't benefit from this but still would love to be able to learn French
Bit of a missed opportunity there
I think that a high level in the language of the country, and a basic knowledge on the country's history and culture should be required to receive the citizenship
Ya wot mate
Ya avin a giggle
The law is different between arts, science and software
Also there are different kind of Creative Commons licenses, and not all of them forbid to sell the thing
Copyright laws are not the default in Europe
In France (and afaik everywhere else in Europe including Romania and Cyprus), the ownership belongs to the creator by default, with the exception of huge productions like movies where there isn't only one creator
Afaik Ireland uses Copyright but the rest of Europe uses a different system for art (something similar to copyright still applies to computer programs though)
There are both author's moral rights and author's patrimonial rights
The latter is very similar to copyright and clearly states that by default the patrimonial ownership of a piece of art belongs to its creator (patrimonial ownership includes the right to make money from it)
The international copyright treaties make it so that if let's say something is produced in Canada then the Canadian law about it applies even for exploitation outside of Canada
It doesn't make the copyright the same everywhere
In summer solstice, not spring
My high school had a tradition of organizing a strike in front of the school
Full French education heh
But I think it's just a local tradition
We were usually blocking the entrances, then we would trash each others with flour and eggs (and any teacher we could get our hands on)
We never had any demand for that strike as far as I am aware
We didn't think about that part
It degenerated in my senior year (for the first time police was dispatched to observe and someone egged them
Leading to reinforcements and the full French strike experience)
Ignoring each other and being respectful, not doing noise
this sort of stuff
Obligatory:
* « Hello » when you cross one in the common area
* trying to limit noise at sleepy time and warning ahead of time if you really have to make noise at sleepy time
If you want to go the extra mile you can also:
* exchange numbers which has to only be used very rarely and only for neighborly matters
* receive parcels for them if you are there and they aren’t when the postman comes, it saves them a redelivery / having to go queue at the post office to retrieve their parcel
You can be friends with you neighbor if you want but it is not required or expected
In France, it depends on where you live:
\- In the cities, Like Toulouse, Marseille or Lyon, you rarely know your neighbors
Paris is the worst case of that because everybody seems to hate each other constantly so it's a bit different
Anyway, in the cities your neighbors are just people that live her, you say hello to them while in the elevator and that's all for the most
\- In the smaller towns, (Around 50k/100k hab for example), like Cannes or Toulon, it's a bit different
In the center, you act almost like every big city, but when you start to get away from the center, usually you start knowing them a bit
You trust them enough to keep an eye on your garden while you're away, sometimes discuss with them, help each other with gardening
You're not "Friends", but you have a good relationship
\- In the small villages (I talk about th ones under 5000 people), you know your neighborhood
The smaller the town the better you know them
You do activities with them
As a child, you know every other child in the neighborhood/village
You don't like everyone of course, but you can be friends with most of them pretty naturally, and it's completely normal
In cities: avoid eye contact, small hello (if they say "bonjour" and it's already late, reply "bonSOIR"  (good evening) wich a sadistic voice)
Small talk only if you feel weirdly happy that day or if you are forced
Take the stairs if they were first on the elevator
Countryside: friendly but secretly hate them because the cousin of their grand-mother's great oncle stole your great grand-father's mushroom secret spot
I live in a small building in a residential area  with only six units, and I know  all my neighbors
My next door neighbors have become friends over the years, and we sometimes socialize while respecting each other’s privacy
With the others, we only exchange pleasantries (Hellos, How are your, etc)
As for my other neighbors who live in my street, I hardly know them, but it’s polite if you meet someone on the sidewalk to smile and say hello
It is most of the time
Happened to me to have a neighbor with a dog that was barking from 7:00 am to 22:00 pm earlier this year, a real pain
But after complaining to the owner and syndicate managing the building, it calmed down a notch to finally end completely 1 month and a half later
I don't know if it's because the puppy grew bored out of it or something else but it's nice, at least
25 minutes in the subway
It used to be 45 min to 1 hour in bus but I moved
I could never imagine how much difference these 20 minutes of commute made in terms of mood, tiredness and motivation at work
I just feel so much better all around
10mn bus, 35mn train, 15mn bus / 25mn walk
I often choose to walk from the station to the office, as I don't mind being 10mn late
I can sit in the train and watch movies on my phone, so it's fine by me
5 minute walk ! I live really close to my university
2 min by foot :)
20 minutes walk or 10 minutes bus ride
Depends
If i’m staying at my parents’ it’s a 5 minutes walk to a tram station, 10 minutes tram ride to a trainstation, 35 minutes train ride to the center of Paris, 10 minutes walking in the Paris trainstations to catch the metro, 7 minutes of metro and a 5 minutes walk to school
It takes about 1h20 from door to door
When at my appartment I walk 7 minutes to the metro station, take a metro for 15 minutes then another one for 10 minutes and the 5 minutes walk to school
So about 35 munutes door to door
And when there’s a strike, I walk there and it takes about 45 minutes
I've been working with a lot of Irish people lately and I absolutely love their names
Saoirse, Caoimhe, Ruairi, Niamh, etc
They were a bitch to learn how to pronounce though lol
Agreed
Friedrich is
Dominique is unisex in French, so you've got your male example already
It even comes [with its own song] what more could you ask for
What are the faux-Greek French names
I’m very curious :)
Aaah oui
Je n’y avais jamais pensé ! Anatole aussi
Théotime
My own dad told me he'd kick me out once I turn 18
He ended up leaving when I was 16
He was a total POS to me so good riddance
France is often mocked to surrender but it’s the country which won the most battles and had the greatest general of all time
Also, in WW2 the battle of Pont-Saint-Louis engaged 9 French against 3000 Italians and French won ( even after the government surrendered like cowards )
So it was you
"Surrendered like cowards" is knowing nothing about the history
France was defeated and had no choice but to surrender
The army prepared for a WWI episode 2 they got a WWII
There was no cowardice in surrendering bevaise there was no choice, the gouvernment cannot refuse peace like de Gaulle did because the gouvernment cannot flee from its own territory has the Pols proved
Moreover the actions led by le Régime de Vichy after the armistice were horrible, an eternal shame to the country but still does not fit the word "coward".
Napoléon won the most battle, that was the meaning of the sentence
We did the same error in both WW, this time error was fatal French army was strong as hell but the shit government acted like cowards to me
They did exactly what France shouldn’t have done
Now France is seen as a weak country
[This video shows how many battles generals in history won]
And fought 6 continental coalitions, yeah
First Coalition (1792–1797): Austria, Great Britain, Spain, and Prussia variously were in or out of this coalition against Revolutionary France
The coalition collapsed with General Napoleon Bonaparte’s success in Italy that led to the Treaty of Campo Formio
The most important battle was probably the Battle of Lodi (May 10, 1796)
Second Coalition (1799–1802): Britain, Austria, and Russia, which were unhappy with French expansion, were the main culprits here
Napoleon was in Egypt for part of this time, winning the Battle of the Pyramids and establishing modern Egyptology, but he hastened back in 1799 and took control of France as First Consul
His campaign in Italy, mostly against the Austrians, was highlighted by the Battle of Marengo (June 14, Third Coalition (1805): Fearful of an expanding France, Britain, Austria, and Russia formed the Third Coalition, but Austria and Russia were soundly beaten at the Battle of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)
The ensuing treaty ended hostilities for only a short time
Third Coalition (1805): Fearful of an expanding France, Britain, Austria, and Russia formed the Third Coalition, but Austria and Russia were soundly beaten at the Battle of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)
The ensuing treaty ended hostilities for only a short time
Fourth Coalition (1806–1807): Russia and Britain were still at war with France, and Prussia jumped into a new coalition
But the Prussians and Russians were soundly drubbed at the Battle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), effectively ending hostilities
Fifth Coalition (1809): Once again, the Austrians and British (these guys just don‘t give up, do they
) joined forces to try to throw Napoleon out of France
And once again, Napoleon thumped the Austrians, this time at the Battle of Wagram (July 5–6, 1809)
But the Brits were getting active in Spain, and the handwriting was on the wall
Sixth Coalition (1812–1814): Russia betrayed Napoleon, and the resulting hostilities led to Napoleon’s invasion of Russia and victory at Borodino (September 7, 1812)
But Napoleon’s withdrawal from Russia opened the floodgates, and one by one his allies became former allies and members of the Sixth Coalition
Napoleon’s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig (October 16–19, 1813) sealed his fate, and in 1814 he was exiled from France (as Emperor of Elba)
Seventh Coalition (1815): Napoleon’s return to France in March 1815 for a second reign as emperor (dubbed the Hundred Days to indicate its duration) caused all his old enemies to unite against him, with final defeat coming at Waterloo (June 18, 1815)
That was it for Napoleon, who was exiled to the island of St
Helena, where he died on May 5, 1821
There is a small village in the US, Castroville (TX), where there are native speakers of Alsatian
Alsatian is an alemanic dialect from the Alsace region in eastern France
It is spoken by less than a million people
Here is an example of a real Alsatian with an alsatian speaker from Castroville, both speaking Alsatian: [
Eating Frogs
Many foreigners think that every French home has a [*bidet*] in the bathroom
It is not the case, they are actually quite rare
We barely eat frog's legs
First time I tried it was in China
France:
Food: onion soup, snails and frogs, brie cheese (brie is common but often seen as not to tasty and very cheap, mostly eaten at schools/hospitals etc)
Also: berret, very good looking/elegant women, babies that don't throw food, smart cars, topless at beach, "french" toast
We wear berets and eat snails
Only the elders still wear berets and snails are eaten only at Christmas and personally I don't like
I went to Poland for a holiday a few years ago, and I didn't get the impression that religion was everywhere, that you were very religious or conservative
But while we were hiking around Zakopane on a sunday morning, I remember arriving in a village where there was no one on the street
They were all at an open-air mass 300m away
I don't know what's with tourists really, we get people asking where to find weed on /r/paris very often
, asking for numbers and so on
Alright, alright, weed is pretty prevalent here but you're not gonna give phone numbers to some random person online
> Car accidents
Yes, we all know the dascham videos, but no, not every drive in Russia is so weird or epic and not every Russian driver is so bad
I always knew it was just the best-of-the-best shitshow we got to see but I still wanna hope that you are lying and Russia is filled with epic stories about drivers doing whatever
It'd be way funnier
That's still more than most people
> Germans apparently loves to use lots of physical pieces of paper for some reason
So that's where the whole "Franco-German Friendship" comes from, the love-hate of administration papers
That one is true
You can find snails in many restaurants but, as far as I know, it’s quite uncommon to consume them at home
For example, I (26 years old), have eaten snails less than 10 times in my life and always at a restaurant
Again, this may vary from person to person
There are guidebooks to France that describe bidet
(I didn't check the Italy counterparts
Except the mimes
And the béret
Saying "bon appétit": yep
Saying "bonjour" a lot: yep (you greet strangers/acquaintances more than in the US, though it kinda depends on context)
béret: not super common, but more common than in the US
blue-and-white striped shirt: not super common, but more common than in the US
rudeness: a little in Paris, otherwise not so much
fashion -- yes
cheese and wine -- YES
man walking down the street with a bag of ten baguettes -- YES
Ok but what about that:   ?
I think it's a papist invasion
I'm 35, I've never eaten frogs and snails maybe twice
Well, bidet is a French word, so we did have some  in the old days
Current fashion is to get rid of bidets if modernising an old bathroom
True, administration in France in a fucking nightmare ...
They're molluscs
They mostly taste like seafood, but less salty
Yet Galicia has the perfect weather to produce them in large numbers
Bidet are really useful tho, we should keep them instead of getting rid of them in "modern" bathroom
#savethebidet
Almost every Christmas and almost never outside of Christmas and new year's eve
The Entente Cordiale, the document which turned the Franco-British relationship into a friendly one, was created to justify why Edward VII kept on going to Paris
Truth is, he just went there to bone prostitutes
Very few French people can tell how the IIIrd Republic came to be, which is a shame since it was the first true republican regime for France that lasted more than few years (we are talking about you, Ist and IInd Republic)
(my apologies in advance for grammar mistakes)
So, at that time, there was a huge debate on whether the French should adopt the republican regime or the monarchist one
After the end of Napoleon III and the Second Empire in 1870, the French people were really divided on should they reconciliate with the monarchy, and adopt a constitutional monarchy with a parliament, or should they definitively abandon the idea and create the IIIrd Republic
The provisional parliament tends to be in favour of the monarchy, but the big question was which house
Since the bonapartist house wasn't really popular (1870 war, defeat of Sedan, that sort of things), the two competitors were the Bourbon house (a.k.a. the legitimist, since they were the royal family of France before the 1789 revolution) and the Orléans house (more progressist than the legitimist, thanks to the moral legacy Louis-Phillipe I, not king of France but king of the French ; a massive difference that made him closer to the people)
Members of each house were fighting for the French crown, when the orleanist got a brilliant idea
The suitor for the crown from the legitimist faction was Henri, Count of Chambord
He was very old and didn't have any son, or heir
The orleanist strategy was to let Henri rule, dies shortly after and then, based on a previously signed agreement, the Orléans house would be granted the French throne
They asked his doctor how many years he would live, and he replied with "7". So, when the royalist president Patrice de MacMahon was elected, he was destined to rule for 7 years
The seven-year mandate cherished by the French Republic (but not anymore since 2000) was created
The orleanist however encountered an issue
Henri, Count of Chambord didn't want only the French throne and the return to the monarchy (which was already A MIRACLE), he also wanted the return of the royalist flag, white with golden fleur de lys
Outrageous for the people who fought and died for this flag for nearly 80 years
Every single royalist, legitimist or orleanist, tried to convince the Count of Chambord to change his mind
A flag combining both the tricolor and the royalist coat of arm was even proposed but nothing could change the mind of Henry
This angered the French people and when the next elections arrived, a decisive republican victory definitively buried the hope of a second restauration
TL;DR: France didn’t turn into a constitutional monarchy because of an old fart who wanted his old flag back
This is also how potatoes were introduced in France
I don't believe either story tbh
Which is false, the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland have already been around for 80 years when you signed your treaty
France never renonced it
Nah, a few clauses have been used (right for a French to live in Scotland for example) until 1909 when the ENGLISH parlement abolished it
Scotland or France never officialy stopped the Alliance
It's technically still in place
I would like to see my government pushed for a New referendum for our oldest allies
Might be wrong, but I never seen buckwheat crêpes outside France
Also I thought for a long time that "galette des rois" was a international tradition
Bread
But, *actually good* bread
We have "Champomy" which is pretty similar and popular at kids parties
I love this shit
In the Brittany region in France it's extremely popular, to make the local pancakes
I mean in every town you can find several restaurants serving almost exclusively buckwheat pancakes ! Not popular at all in the rest of the country though
In France we do it, but not with every stranger, and depending on the region it's a different number of kisses, but nobody ever knows how many so it's a mess and you have to agree on a number before of while kissing cheeks
Wait, "galette des rois" isn't eaten in other historically catholic country ?!
Myeaaah kind of
Champomy is closer to cider than it is to Apfelschorle I guess
Ça veut dire maïzena ?
But do you eat savoury crêpes ? (With things like ham, eggs, cheese
We call the continent Oceania and the country Australia but since it's pretty much the same thing we often say Australia
Sarrasin/blé noir :)
Ah oké merci
I have always seen it as a thing you were supposed to wait for the host to tell you (something like "here is the place for the shoes") the first time you enter someone's home
Next times you usually can take them off without asking
I am a simple man, give me a simple blowtorched crème brûlée and I will die a happy man
The [Millefeuille] is a french pastry invented in Dijon, during the 17th century
Of course there are so much more amazing desserts that I can't think of
[Lemon Meringue Pie] is probably my favorite, and surprisingly easy to make at home
I have it almost every year for my birthday and bake it several times a year for special occasions
Chocolate éclair
And Paris-Brest but it's not always available in the stores
this is delightful
Ah it is soooo good
Oh mämmi looks very intriguing, thanks for sharing it here ! I'll wait for my next holiday to prepare some, since it takes 4 days to make
Apart from kladdkakor and all the bullar you guys have, I really liked [Princesstårta] on occasions, with its original bright green icing !
Yes, delicious when done well
The origins are discussed though, so not sure it is 100% French
You don't like profiteroles
Probably in my top 3 with a crème brûlée and a millefeuilles
Paris-Brest beats everything
I miss it so much
Millefeuilles > all
>bread with marmalade and cheese
Sir that's a sin
There's also the [Kouign Amann] which seems to be very well-known among the French, but practically unheard of abroad
You could swear it was something straight up from an "Epic Meal Time" episode
It's also fairly easy to make if you've already done puff-pastry dough, the only difference being that with every fold you make on the dough, you add sugar
I am not a sweet food person
I mainly like crème brûlée and good flan
Anything with crème pâtissière is a no go for me
You seem to be very much into ganache
My favorite super fattening dessert is banoffee pie, it’s just so good but it’s concentrated fat and sugar
I think it's almost more popular in France than in Italy lol
When I was living in Umeå, I remember someone telling me it's more of a Norrland dessert, is it true in your experience ? Or is it maybe more holiday-related too in the rest of the country ?
Man kan ju inte köpa prinsesstårta här, men jag har precis i dag bakat råg knäckebröd ! Det finaste som finns i den svenska gastronomin tycker jag !
Respectable of course, but still a pity
It is not about who's first, it is about the one who has brought it to the next level
I don’t really see why
Pourquoi vous vous parlez pas en français c'est pas comme ça qu'on va préserver notre belle langue
I honestly don't know the origins of the profiterole, I just know I enjoy so much eating them
And it is just in about any restaurant menu in France
Indeed during the 17 and 18th centuries, Europe was probably even more a thing than today
The royal alliances influenced every countries' cultures
There are some variations of the filling
Usually it is a kind of custard /pastry cream, but nowadays it is often filled in with vanilla icecream
You can also find a kind of chantilly cream filling
The constants are the ball shape choux, and the hot melted chocolate
Everyone is speaking in English, it’s an international forum of discussion
I didn’t realize our language was on the brink of disappearance
That the Maginot line was useless and the Fench were surprised by the invasion of Benelux
TLDR is that the objective of the line was dissuasion and for various reasons, fighting the Germans in Belgium was planned but not so much a breakthrough through the Ardennes
well
do i really have to explain
History have been manipulated by anglos
US and UK supported germany during the 1870 war
And after that anglophile put us in WW1 and we lost 1
7 millions lives
After WW1 we have been accused of making the treaty of Versaille to hard but they don't said that initially Germany was supposed to be balkanised but US and UK refused
Then they supported german during all 1920', 1930' with many investments in their industry against France
After WW2 they wanted France to be a colony of USA
Liberation is only a recent word
They talked about "invasion" in 1944
Hopefully the anglo plan have been blocked
No, we didn't give up during WW2
We simply got destroyed
Also Portugal is just the Latin name of Porto, Portus Cale (the Duchy of Porto who gained independence from Leon)
That France just rolled over instead of fighting during the battle of France
The battle of France was short but very intense actually and the Germans had nearly 90k men killed and more than 100k wounded, they also lost 25% of their tanks, 35% of their aircrafts and more than 1000 qualified pilots, all that in five weeks
The planes were replaced with time but the lack of qualified pilots is one of the reasons they lost the Battle of Britain against the Royal Air Force
The German very rarely had air superiority after Battle of Britain as the allies constantly could field many more aircrafts at any given time because they didn’t lose a ton of pilots at the start
France did many stupid strategic and political mistakes causing a rapid defeat but the troops on the field often fought hard despite being often cut off from their hierarchy and encircled
Never did that
More wars probably, more battles certainly
You guys are second if my memory serve me correclty
But we cheated we always had more neighbours than you
The Algerian and Vietnamese wars are not "major" wars on the international level, they were wars of independence
The French population no longer cared about the colonies, and I am glad that we have "lost" these wars
These wars represent a political abandonment of the French colonial empire by the representatives, not " crushing " defeats
Ex: The Algerian war leaded to the 1962 Algerian independence referendum
Well "saving" Europe and being as evil as Nazi Germany aren't exclusive
Yeah it was a county my bad, but still Portugal comes from Portucale, the city of Porto
The main reason is Gamelin was a shit commander who did not bother liaising with our Belgian allies until right before German invasion, changed plans at the last minute and had retarded ideas like not trusting radio and instead relying on motorcycle dispatches to send orders while German high command was fully equipped with radio in every tank
He managed to get the whole allied army encircled in the first weeks of the battle leading to a hasty retreat to avoid losing literally the whole army
Politically the Reynaud government was pretty pro war but they made the mistake of bringing in Petain (who was then a military legend) to try and rally the troops, Petain then basically sabotaged the whole thing by calling for the troops to lay down their arms and stop fighting without consulting anyone
That's strange, the English Wikipedia article says 27k dead Germans, the French article says between 27k and 63k.
I've noticed similar differences on other articles about other battles
What could cause such a difference between languages ? Sources ?
And they cheated by fighting third world country
I mean India got you one bajillion war on your counter, but you're right
Yes, central heating from wood stove at my parents
This is one of those rural/urban divides where we just can't understadn each other I guess
In my area, wood pellet stove are getting popular
It's a stove with a thermostat, and can automatically start and stop
It also have a large block of stone to store heat, giving a lot of inertia to the system
It's a largely forested area, artificial pine forest, so the pellets come from residues from wood industry
Instead of transforming electric power into heat, it pumps calories from outside inside your house
In temperate climate, it's quite efficient
We learned that it really was a bad idea to try to invade Russia in Winter
And well not really a force for good since the whole Europe hated us
"We brought freedom to the world"
In school we learn about napoleon, but tbh not enough I think around 1 or 2 lessons while it's one of the most important period of history
The school system portrays him as someone incredibly smart especially internally
I personnally think he is one of the most interesting and smartest person in the world history
And our empire led by him was a force for good according to me (ww1 or ww2 probably wouldnt have happened if he had succeeded)
I'm pretty sure the ideals of the french revolution were more a force for good than the ideals of the monarchy that were carried by the austrian russian and english
The macedonian empire lasted for so little time that you can't really say tbh
Ye the big mistake was probably waiting a month in Moscow for the Russian surrender that never came
But isn't the lingua franca there because of the usa ?
I mean if it wasn't for the USA becoming such a powerhouse the world would probably not have a lingua franca
I know the usa was a british colony but let's be honest it's a very small part of the british history
lol no
Comparing evils is never a good idea, but the brits were not better or worse than the rest
That beliefs is yet another false facts taught to the brits on the topic
Who attacked who ?
The british empire wasn't as bad as the nazi
But it for sure was really really bad on the level of stalin ussr or mao china
Millions of native in america and australia killed willingly through direct means(straight up killing) or indirect means (disease)
Millions of Indian starving to death, the british had one of the richest country on earth (india had like a quarter of the world gdp during the mughal reign) and when they left it the country was ruined
There's many other things ofc (boer war,ireland etc)but wherever the british empire went, things got worse for the population already established, MUCH worse usually
Yeah I mean they were tolerant for the first 300 years so that for sure excuse the many genocide and massacre the empire commited :D
Idk only 12% of indian are english speaker (still enough to make it the 2nd biggest english speaking country in the world tho)
south africa has 31% of their population that speaks english and 10% have it as their first language
And I could give the stats of basically every former colony beside new zeland australia canada and hong kong(hk still have a smaller percentage of english speaker than south korea)  they'd be pretty much the same aka really low
It's fair to say that those number would be much much lower if english wasn't the lingua franca of the world and important for business and science
Which it mostly is because of how important the US influence was on the world
PS: I'm obviously not claiming the english empire didn't help my argument is just that it's influence was smaller than that of the US
PS2: Also it may be a surprise but english is not the only lingua franca in the world  :D french and russian are also lingua franca (if you go to a former ussr country like armenia good luck finding anyone speaking english but everyone will speak russian same if you go to the former french colony in africa)
Right, but of all of these the only one worth doing business with during the better part of a century (and also the time when English became lingua franca) was the USA
As long as it's not used as an excuse to make the brit one look better
All of them were essentially people with guns using their military superiority to plunder other people
A sad indictment of people in those days
But the way we treat it today reflects who we are today
Idk much about British rule in Singapour so I can’t speak about it
The British were good in Hong Kong I can agree with you, also honestly the worst thing they did to Hong Kong was to give it to the Chinese (it wasn’t perfect with many riot occurring but still much better than if it was part of China)
But exemple of 2 small colony don’t really changes much my point still stand
Singapore was a swamp when the Brits left
Now nearby Malaya, that's were the true decolonisation violence occurred

I can't be forgiven for that
Shame on me
I'm a small weeb, I think I can recognize half the names on that list
Definitely possible that he did not Google depending on the weebness
In France it's **Jacques-Yves Cousteau**, hands down
I mean, he was world-famous for his TV show " [The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau] ", and two movies: "The Silent World" and "World Without Sun".
Although, Gen Z probably never heard about him
&#x200B;
[Jacques Cousteau - Wikipedia]
I would say Jamy Gourmand with "C'est pas sorcier". A famous ~~vulgarisator~~  populariser who made from 1993 to 2014 a total of 599 episodes of roughly 26 minutes explaining different scientific things such as wine making or geological phenomenons
It was intended for the kids but had a lot of very complex concept explained with some amazing handmade models and cheap but funny sounds
Plus the differents reporters used to go to different places to meet the experts and show the phenomenons in action
For my generation it is The ~~emission~~ show we all watched as kids and made some of us love science
> was
Don't you fucking scare me like that
Fun fact 2: most of the music used in his documentaries was composed by [Vangelis]
I don't know what's your generation but it was popular among mine, I'm born in 2002
Though, my younger sister born in 2010 doesn't have something comparable
I’d also think of Stephane Bern, history populariser
Jamy, Marcel, Fred et Sabine
[link] for whoever is interested, I just watched the episode about the Iberian wolves
It is amazing how well it holds up, even more than 40 years later
Wow
I love Vangelis, especially the Blade Runner soundtrack
Also, Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) was the narrator of the English language versions of the show
Those films are still very enjoyable to watch even though they are close to being 50 years old
Thanks for the help
Now that i reread it, sure we do love our nuclear gaz emissions in France, especially during childhood, but it is not the subject here
I was born at the end of the 90's, so we are in the same generation
My brother born in 2011 is a great fan of it
you can find all of them on youtube, and there is a webside that has links for all of the different episodes
you hould try to show it to your sister
Link :
Not for my generation, in my opinion
He died in 1997 so his stuff was more iconic for the earlier generation
I'm sure my parents and grandparents know him and his work
But tbf i never watched a show by Jacques Cousteau so i can't tell if it is iconic
Et la p'tite voix !
Yeah these ones are awesome too
I am a die-hard Blade Runner fan, that's all
Probably Manuel Valls
He's so hated that he left France to live in Spain
If you do say it, be sure not to live in a city with a famous cathedral that has a 123m-tall spire
Well, he's not that vigilant, catching the virus and all
I usually cook them in the oven
You insult us
It's not, Flemish OP is right
I feel like France is doing alone the european military protection and we are kinda also alone trying to make the EU's foreign diplomacy alive
I wish southern europeans countries would be rather on our side than on Germany's one about plenty of topics
To French people, people go to Amsterdam for two reasons: weed and prostitutes
>-The only EU Member to openly hate the French
-We
Only because the UK left the chat
>We let all Europeans drive however the fuck they wish every summer when you all visit us
I mean, we simply adapt to the way locals drive
For the sake of European unity, I will not comment on the wine stuff
> The UK has good intelligence services
That might be the only thing with intelligence left in the UK
Thanks for the wars
I am not so sure all those who voted in favour of Brexit had this in mind
I am under the impression it was more something like "Europe sucks, we pay way too much to the EU, so we want out, bye bye
Oh, economical consequences
What are those
Mali asked military help to France because djihadist militias took over the whole north of the country and were getting closer to the capital
If we didnt helped them we were the bad guys, if we do help them we are the bad guys anyway meanwhile the only military assets going next to Greece when Turkey was flexing around were french warships and hunters aircrafts
But we are the baddies ofc
Why do you think that
Just because there would (should
) be a common EU army for defence doesn't mean countries don't get to have their own national army anymore
Just like space agencies, ESA is European, but France still has CNES as a national space agency
Damn the HRE
I'd rather have an EU army that's strictly defensive
Otherwise it'd be too easy to be used for personal gain by influential country leaders, as you say
The entire point of an EU Army would be to get rid of NATO and American influence on Europe
Not to mention that NATO has been used offensively for unjustified wars too: Afghanistan and Libya are two examples
I agree that an EU army, if it was to be made today, wouldn't be much useful, probably wouldn't deter Russia or Turkey, just look at how unintimidated Erdogan is when the EU gets "angry". But IMO it's something we should work towards
I'm expecting some names such as Phillipe Petain to pop up, but bear with me as I have a little more obscure tale to relate
Back in 1980, during the Cold War, a KGB agent named Vladimir Vetrov came to the French secret services to offer his help
The reasons why he did so remain mysterious, but we know that he wasn't forced to do it, and was a self proclaimed francophile
Over the course of the next two years, he delivered to the French secret services a little less than 3000 pages of classified documents coming from the KGB, all of them shared with the MI6 and the CIA
Including among other things, a list of all Soviet spies set in France, some with an official diplomatic status
The French government expelled the Soviet diplomats quoted in the list without further ado
But here's where the story takes an extremely dark turn: the Soviet ambassador demanded explanations for these actions
Francois Scheer, head of cabinet for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received him and presented the original document with the KGB list
Thanks to this document, the KGB was able to track down in no time who could have had access to it, and found out Vetrov's name
Vladimir Vetrov ended captured, and executed in a prison in Moscow
Meanwhile, Francois Scheer was never inquired for having blown their double agent's cover, even though the French secret services are still mad at him
It is known here as the Farewell case, how one of the biggest USSR traitors created in turn one in our side
Targeting a whole foreign entity instead of a person or a group of persons is quite counterproductive and it's telling, down to the arrogance you mention below
Especially when the traitors are not from your country, your ranks, your blood
I didn't know Czechia was perfect to the point when each individual, at any moment of your whole history, stayed loyal, no matter the circumstances, that you're forced to pick something, someone out of your own
Brilliant
I can't even imagine your feels to be stuck with a whole population of traitors in the EU
Yes they *did*. Quite a few generations occured since then as you may be aware
Where is the limit ? Eternity of autoflagellation for the said country's population
I didn't felt personally attacked, why should I've been ? I would have said the exact same thing if OP attacked a foreign entity on a thread asking you about traitor(s) from your country's history
Targeting someone or something for their guilt instead of your own when asked about your own is just low
> Well, Germany excluding
Just like that
How so ?
The only one I can think of is pretty old, from may or june this year
Our president has let one of his friends disguise as a policeman in order to beat the crap out of protesters back in May
His identity has been revealed since then and we learnt for example in a leaked phone call that he wasn’t afraid of anything because "The boss is behind him"
He’s now pretty serene & his life has not changed much
That piece of shit even challenged a Brazilian MMA fighter to fight him when the former insulted our first lady
That government does not make much sense tbh
It's actually from may 2018
But it's been talked about for more months and it's a big mess so at this point it's hard to follow the exact timeline
Probably the first time I went to Basque Country, in a rural area with my family when I was a child
It was really hard to understand what people were saying
Food, sport and culture were different
Everything was translated in basque
I felt like a foreigner when I arrived
The south of france looks like a different country, it looks more like spain or italy than other parts of france in so many ways
The way that people from Paris says the sound "o". This
It scares me
I had the same in Alsace : the towns, the accent, the regional language
A lot of things were really different there
Yes, some people there speak Alsatian
Used to be the Ministry of Defence (and Ministry of War a long time ago), now called Ministry of the Armed Forces (since 2017)
I don't complain that much
I don't like cheese
I don't like cheese and wine
lol i poured beer into a wine glass at a party the other day to share with a friend, it was no longer sad Aldi "bier" according to him, it became "*Bière*".
I have no words for you
May god have mercy on your soul
Had the same with pastis and rugby in France
I was pretty much forced to drink it, i love it now (and i hate licorice and anis flavored things)
Saoul comme un polonais (Being drunk as a Pole) => being drunk
But in reality, the expression comes from there:
>After a decisive battle of Kozietulski's Polish light horses in Spain in 1808, the heroic survivors of this elite unit were paraded before Napoleon
French generals, jealous and wanting to minimize the role of the Poles, indicated that they were drunk
The Emperor replied: "So, gentlemen, know how to be drunk like Poles
If someone doesn't speak English (or another language well), they'll say they speak it like a Spanish cow
"To speak like a Spanish cow" (France)
Saoul comme un Polonais (Drunk as a Polish)
C'est du Chinois pour moi (this is Chinese to me, means you can't understand any of it)
Branlette espagnole (spanish wank, tittyjob)
C'est Byzance / c'est pas byzance (It's byzantium / it is not byzantium, means it's the height of luxury, it isn't really luxury)
That's "partir à l'anglaise" here, or "leaving the English way".
In France we greet women by kissing them (more like cheek to cheek and kissing the air) except if it's formal (greeting your friend's girlfriend : kiss, meeting your boss for the first time : shake hands)
Some men greet themselves this way as well but it's more rare (mostly family members)
I don't really know about other countries, but in Japan for exemple it's extremely rude
Same in South-western France
not just family, all the close friends
It's weird to shake hands with friends it's so formal
It's really good tho
In France it's controversial on media but we do it often with friends
It's pretty rare but afaik it's ok in France too (at least for my family, and there is a "boucher chevalin" in the market nearby)
Not in France
now you have to explain Pivo and Rohlik
The "Quadrille des Lanciers"  is also danced at the Polytechnique's Prom [with the same touching clumsiness]
Another tradition that I find  cringy is the "game of the garter" at weddings
The reception becomes an auction room
The bride stands on a platform
The guests give money and at each new auction, the bride rolls up her dress a little more
At the end, when her garter is visible, the person who has made the greatest contribution wins the privilege of taking it off
[With the teeth]
I think I'll go for Carnaval in the North of France
I don't think it's very much done anymore though
People use to dress as the opposite sex and meet in front of the mayors hoise
He would then proceed to through buckets of fresh herrings on the crowd with one or two lobsters in there
If you were lucky, you'd catch the lobster
In Belgium I always loved the Gilles
They'd go in the street dressed up in their magnificent costumes and would throw oranges at the crowd
I always remember running and trying to grab one before hiding for a bit
I also remember that through the years it got a bit more sensible so you wouldn't get knocked off your boots by an orange
Never heard of those
Louis Ferdinand Celine is a very well known and very talented French author who is still studied in school, his books are considered classics
He was also extremely antisemitic and was an eager Nazi collaborator
Napoleon
Our boy Napoléon, in reality it was totalitarism
And I think a few ^^^^^^million people too
Capturing Richard the Lionheart was pretty dumb but it somehow worked out in the end
The Austrian Succession War
Well, I was going to say the dumbest thing our country did was Napoleon betraying Spain
Abusing the trust of an ally, pretending to just pass through, and then actually invading the country may be one of the worst dick move in history
Not cool, Bonaparte
Yeah I agree, not renewing the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia was a pretty bad idea
Wilhelm II did so many stupid things
He had too big an ego
are tulips some metaphore about bitcoins ?
What
It's far from being the stupidest thing
It actually prevented the germans from taking control of the fleet
The real dumb thing was Mers el Kebir when the brits asked us to hand over the fleet after our defeat and we refused, so they had to sink it all
I globally agree with everyone else by saying that the Lichtenstein have a very nice car plate design
But I'd like to talk about the french designs, because I think it's funny
Old french plates used to include the département number in the car plate number in order to classify them more easily
And french people got attached to it
You see, France is very xenophobic when they drive and see a bad driver from another département
You wouldn't find any french person that likes the drivers from the Ile de France région (so the départements 75 (Paris), 77 (seine et marne), 78 (yvelines), 91 (essone), 92 (hauts de seine), 93 (seine saint denis), 94 (val de marne), 95(val d'oise))
In the same way, people used to be nicer to corsica's plates (2A and 2B) because of Corsican terrorists (and because Corsicans have a bad rep in metropolitan France)
EDIT: it also makes me think of my grandmother who told me a story of my grandpa when he was a kid
You have to know that the Finistère was very poor after WW2 (and even before tbh)
Many people relied solely on agriculture to live, but they couldn't compete with the industrialised agriculture of the UK (which is just across the channel), so they were economically fucked
Not to mention that the Bigoudens (people from there) were among the poorest peoples on that area
According to my grandma, the only good cars my grandpa saw when he was a kid were from the Morbihan (he could see the 5~~3~~6 in their plates) and they usually got trashed on a regular basis out of spite
That's another example of xénophobie départementale
A few years ago, the plate design changed in a national way, so the département's number didn't appeared in the car plate's number anymore
But French people got pissed, because we couldn't be racist toward each other anymore
So they added that small part on the right side of the plate for the département
This part is unnecessary and you can ask to get a car plate from a département that isn't the one you bought your car in (my father got a 29 (finistère) car plate while he lives in the 41 (loir et cher) and bought his car in the 45 (loiret))
People do that now to either show their heritage (My father's case
He is from the Finistère and loves his plate, my GF too have a 69 (Rhône) plate while we live and she bought her car in the 01 (ain) département)
Some do to fear off the wankers (you'll see quite a lot of relatively nice cars with a car plate from Corsica even though they're not corsican because they piggyback on the clichés of Corsicans being revengeful assholes)
I think that's fun to know
France used to have black letter with white background in front plate and yellow background in back plate but they changed it in 2009 :'(
The old format was geographical too, you had to change plate if you move to another region
Knowing the area where the other driver lived was causing endless road rage shit-talking
The new ones aren't geographical but the plate still feature the area on the side because people were attached to it
Some people also choose the 93 number because Seine-Saint-Denis is the new Corsica lol
Personally I never had problems with my 94 plate outside of IDF
>from the Morbihan (he could see the 53 in their plates)
Morbihan is 56, 53 is Mayenne
There are shitloads of Seine-Maritime plates because grey cards are cheapest in Normandie, so companies prefer the former for their vehicule fleet
Oh yeah, it can be useful to know where your fellow driver is from
How else would I be able to shit talk about their region when they cut the line
Even better
if you're one of the 617 inhabitants of Tupin-et-Semons, your postal code is 69420
Oh, I didn't knew that
I don't think I've ever saw a french plate without the province though
Is that common in Italy
Lol we had departments before Italy even existed, they're a big part of our identity and we use them on plates since they were invented
That's because you don't hear the other drivers
I am to blame myself, for I worked in a parking for a national event where I saw many over many parisian cars that I cussed for they were arrogant
I generally have a bad stereotype on cars with 75 on them but I don't know why people hate the banlieue like we were Parisians lol
We are at this weird spot where Parisians think we are the countryside and the countryside thinks we are Parisians
Is the province your from and the province your car was bought a big deal
Like, would a tusconian go like "ew, this car comes from Sicilia, I'm not even gonna poke it with a stick
Oh you talk about new plates my bad I thought you talked about the concept of showing the department number
It's Paris of course, just like it's London
But if we exclude those cities because they don't play in the same yard AT ALL, then it's probably Lyon or Toulouse
Resolving a problem without creating five more
Dunkin' Donuts
I feel like they're at almost every street corner in other countries but non-existent in France for some reason
At least a chance at the 2nd best team to winning the soccer league
Discipline
Yeah
We love to complain
" Pourquoi faire simple quand on peut faire compliqué"
"why make it simple while you can make it complicated"
France's way of life
For once France shall join you on this one
belgium does not like plastic money either iirc
Y'all have stronger immune systems than the rest of us, you'll be fine
As a vegetarian, I find German cuisine has quite decent meat-free options
Even in the 90s, I could easily find something to eat in Germany even in the middle of nowhere
Sure, this isn't the best country for people who love salad
But I love recipes with potatoes and cream so I don't mind
As an American living in France for a long time, it is pretty sweet
There were zero advantages to the US system (besides dental, so I guess *one*)
Because we're right to do with guys like macron and his predecessors since the death of Pompidou
Belwhat ? Is this a territoire d'outre-mer ?
I haven't had many problems paying with a CB in Belgium, and we live about 12 KMs from the border
[Don't forget Houston
I don't think complaining is ever right
Being helpful is ideal
Complaining is seeing a problem and doing nothing positive to help
Helping is seeing a problem and stepping up to take positive action
Les gilets jaunes were not helpful
And didn't the Dutch government restrict sales in border cities to Dutch citizens
My experience is that in Brussels, starting at 9pm, every ATM is emptied by thirsty customers
And i guess they have atm at the French border for French people
Either your kebabs are very expensive or your pizzas are really cheap
Here, a pizza is usually 2x as expensive as a kebab
I agree, I've always been careful with this
French people are obsessed with chicken stock too, and also lard in my region (it's not so common now but it was everywhere before and the elderly still use it for cooking), so I always tell vegetarians travelling to either country to ask for no chicken stock or lard in their dish
Fortunately every time I travelled people have been very nice and the food was great !
>Of course I'd not shout that he is a dick in front of his office, but who can do it in front of their president's office
We do
Little local tradition
People want to pay their double Irish Dutch sandwich in cash :)
Where do you work ? Oberthur, Gemalto ?
Can't argue with that
Hell yeah
And thank you for myth busting some fake clichés and stereotypes about Belarus
You guys deserve more spotlight beyond being just "Little Russia" in the eyes of the world
With a line when it's a capital letter in cursive
Other than that, no
As someone who learns Italian casually with Duolingo, I never realized the Italian alphabet had fewer letters ! Anyway, in French, the cursive 'z' is different
At least, from what I remember of my school years long ago
It's with a loop at the bottom like for 'g'.
I write it with a line in the middle only doing maths to not confuse with a 2
Middle names aren't really a thing
But additional first names are
Usually 2 or 3 first names are given at birth
Though due to a mistake at my birth, I only have one
For my part, my 3rd name "Natchite" is apparently from a famous native American
Being overly expressive (to look polite I guess
Like you bake them a pie and they'll be like "O.M.G. it's absolutely brilliant, this is the BEST pie I had in my life
", and you're like "wtf, it's just a pie dude". They do it so often for most things, sounds so fake to me, when an american person is giving me a compliment I'm just like "meh, whatever", I don't believe it to be genuine, sounds exaggerated most of the time
Beginning a conversation on the phone without saying hello and, more importantly, hanging up without saying goodbye
The hug
Way too much body contact, especially with someone I just met
Not an American habit, but an America habit
the fact that wherever you turn you'll see or hear the three letters "God" placated pretty much everywhere
on dollar bills, on official building, in the morning-pledge at school
Agreed, while I think mandatory tipping is ridiculous and a shitty system I always tipped the amount required when I was in the US for that exact reason
Here you have to put a coin to unlock it and you get it back when you lock it back
There are easy workaround but it’s enough to make the big majority of people bring it back
It looks like some people genuinely think that it's ok because you can see so many on the parking lot, I can't believe they all know they are being assholes
It does require a deposit, but many stores have a plastic coin with the name of the store on it so people could leave them anywhere
But I've never seen it
I've only seen stolen carts in weird places
I think he's referring to [this typical American style] and in summer, the sandals are here
Believe me
That's a really cool job
Haha that is still crazy common compared to over here where it predominantly done for religious reasons
It could be, but then again I had an American friend who did just that and other nationalities don't seem to do that as much as Americans on TV
Idk
They said "shooting", not "knifing".
gonna walk the whole parking lot, no matter if it rains or snows, but I'm gonna get my 50 cents back
No the price is without service basically, you have to add 20% to the bill for the waiter or it means the waiter will pretty much not be paid for waiting on you (they get a small salary from their employers but it’s far from enough to live without the tips)
Labour code in the US is pretty much non existent so unless you have a very rare skill that makes you difficult to replace your boss can do pretty much what they want with you
Marseille, France :
THe [**MUCEM**] (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations) was inaugurated in 2013, and was well-received by the population of the city
[At night]
[The view underneath the "canopy]
[The footbridge to the nearby Fort Saint-Jean]
Right next to it, you can see the [**Villa Méditerranée**] which boasted the biggest inhabitated overhang in the world at the time of its inauguration
It is sadly not used anymore for various reasons (it has high operating costs, no more than 300 people can be at the same time in the overhang for accessibility reasons, etc)
There is also the  [**CMA-CGM tower**] designed by Zaha Hadid; it is the headquarter of the French shipping company CMA-CGM
[Closer look on the curvature]
There is now a second tower near it, the "[**La Marseillaise**] tower, that isn't too bad either; I think I remember it winning an architectural prize or something
You either love it or hate it
I hate it
It's the [Musée des Confluences] in Lyon
This is really pretty, but how is it not terrible for the trees
They have no room for their roots to grow
Interesting thanks, that makes me feel better :)
Well put
Architecture should be a sign of the Zeitgeist of the era, it should show the historical context
The bright green cross is the least flashy element in that entire building
The urgent things to be integrated :
- Taxes
- Retirement
- Army
The rest is kind of bullshit, if those three are dealt with
* What do they look like
A headless version of the default princess
* Do they have an animal sidekick
A little rat follows her and carry her head in a wheelbarrow, he sings sometimes
* Magical powers
She's alive, somehow
France wouldn't have a princess, what an abhorrent idea
We'd have the lady from Delacroix's painting "La Liberté guidant le Peuple", dressed as Jeanne d'Arc / Joan of Arc
She would have a majestic rooster or better yet, a triumphant snail as sidekicks
She would be able to make food appear from thin air, to make her countrymen rally round her and to haunt English people's dreams
Ghost (because she heard voices) sheep (because she was a shepherdess) as a side-kick, no royal blood of any kind
Okay i'm hyped now
Maybe a mix then, because the character names and the architecture look pretty french
Not a word about Finland in 12 years of school
Sorry but never heard of it, and actually I’ve never heard about anything regarding Finland history
Well, Finland joining the EU is in there, but that's about it
Nope
We learned about our neighbors once, but that's it
I had to learn this by myself
In Geography, we talk about the "global dynamics" like exchanges, flows, production, organisation of a city/industrial region, or the difference between countries and inegalities in these countries
I know almost nothing about Bulgarian history so don’t take this as an offense but I think that French history is already so rich and complex that we just don’t have time to study the History of countries we have nothing in common with
We even don’t have time to know all of our own
Besides in France, the history and geography programs are not really well made
it’s kind of messy
wow ok that’s pretty badass, well done !
Yeah that's a shame
There are many people that don't look farther than their nose
The irony is that in history class, some weeks ago, we talked about the European Union
At one point, we talked about the difficilty of creating an "European Culture", because, for example, people from France don't feel close to Czechia
At this point I just wanted to say yeah sure that people won't feel like that if our programms are so shit
Obviously France and Czechia don't have much in common, but the governments just stay there and say "welp boys, that's it". Instead of being "Francocentric", the History and Geography class should open the students to the world
Yes we don't have much in common with Czechia, Poland or Croatia, but we can create this link
Even if historically there is almost nothing between us, we can still create a common feeling in Europe
Someone can feel close to a country without  ever going there
That's this feeling that is needed to be created
By teaching the students about the history of Europe in its entierety, not just focusing on France, or any home country, we can start to create a bond between countries
well, I (F18) know for example that for the study of WW2, we’ve barely heard about the Japan-China conflict, or we’ve never talked the Apartheid in South Africa, or the conflict between Pakistan and India
There are a lot of things that we don’t talk about that are really important in the world History
We’ve never even studied the Indochina War though it was one of our colonies !
who would have thought right ?
in my opinion, the programs suck so the class depends a lot on the professor and thank god I’ve always had good professors but it’s not always the case since in France you can’t fire a public servant
Not an expert but I always found the [Sainte Chapelle] interior incredible
For complementary nature/manmade stuff, the [Mont Saint Michel] never disappoints
[Les Espaces d’Abraxas] were featured in  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  and then there is a steel framework tower in our capital that was met with much animosity, but that is engineering, not architecture
Notre-Dame
For cathedrals, I'd go with Amiens as the most impressive, but there are a ton of gorgeous ones of course
For modern architecture, the Pont du Gard
Edit: Meant Millau Viaduct
The Viaduc de Millau blew me away too, didn't even think to mention it
Pretty underrated
I got myself mixed up, I meant the Millau Viaduct
the Pont du Gard is great too obviously, mixed them up because they're relatively close geographically
BAC officers, BAC is a department of police that are generally sent first on any situation
They are plain clothes officers and they are absolute dicks to basically everyone and especially if you are not white
Apparently it comes from the fact that officers who ask for this posting tend to be looking for action but no matter the reason these guys are often racist pricks who get off the power they get over people
I don’t think any police department is quite universally reviled as BAC, even the CRS (riot police) are not as hated as them and they are hated a lot too for their brutality
It’s always like that, the less power they have, the more they get off it
But August Diehl
Plain clothes mean they are dressed like civilians
They have an armband when they intervene but they are often used to arrest dealers and criminals in the act and so they keep a low profile until the last second to avoid spotters
The Academie Francaise is a group of people who sit and decide about new words and spelling for official documents of the French government
I often read in U.K. and US news about the Academie forcing French people to not use English words and preventing the French language from moving into the 21st century and trying to paint the French as stuck-up and arrogant people who hate English and anything that is not French
Nobody knows or cares about the Academie in France
Another example is when France banned free refills in fast-food restaurants
It was never the norm, it’s just not part of the culture
Again, I learned it on US news
Reddit went crazy
Lots of Americans got very emotional writing about how they will never visit France, how the government is oppressing it’s people, and how America is the last bastion of freedom shinning light over the world
Nobody gives a shit in France
It was bizarre to witness this overreaction for something as meaningless as a free refill that was never part of the culture to begin with
From people who go bankrupt from medical bills because of their backward system
We've got pretty much the same here, our far-right party is the second biggest but with the way our system works and the fact that a ton of people won't ever vote for them there's no realistic way they come to power
I remember the free refill shit, it was so fun reading about it on internet
The journalist should visit r/natureismetal more often
They had to change their country name to Eswatini to deflect that threat
Well, i buy a baguette almost everyday
Wine, baguette and cheese for dinner
and breakfast
and lunch
Ate cheese and baguette like everyday
Blowing 60€ on a cheese platter and then passing three different bakeries to go to the one I like so I had the best bread to go with it
Also when I moved in one of the first things I bought were three different sets of wine glasses for champagne, whites and reds
2 weeks ago, I had a *jambon-beurre* baguette sandwich with a glass of Bordeaux red wine at the counter of a *bistrot* in Paris
It felt like heaven
There, you have it
Both hudging others and being never late are checking out
I'm glad to read that, I would never imagine making a Danish stranger happy by buying baguettes ahah
Dual citizenship isn’t a problem in France and I’m glad that’s the case
It seems absurd to block it
Maybe the problem comes from the UK, as I don't think we've got any restrictions about having several nationalities
But your case sounds a bit odd as I know some people who have both the British and the French nationalities
I was quite young, so I got only fuzzy memories of it
In the 90's, as a teen, you had to be death and blind to not know what a condom was and how essential it was to avoid AIDS
AIDS was synonym with slow, miserable, inexorable death with no real cure for it
That is so sad
Thanks for explaining
Countries have different policies
I donate in Germany and there are many boxes you have to check
You are considered an at-risk person if you’ve had sex with more than 3 people in the past year
I like how Italian sounds more than Spanish
But Japanese and British English are my favorites
I like Italian and Russian
Even knowing that since a long time, as a French it's always surprising to see how many people love how French sounds
Italian wins that one for me
My favourite is Scots Gaelic, a shame it's a dying language
Funny, I hate how Spanish sounds (nothing against you hispanophones, that is just a preference)
To me, German with the right accent is the most beautiful, followed by Russian
Not à European language but Cantonese and Mandarin sound really beautiful
my favorite is french lol
French guy hating how French sounds here, but loving the accents, intonations, sonorities and phrasing of Nordic languages
As someone working with a lot of Americans it's not bad at all and sometimes  very cool or even funny to hear, especially the strongest (southern
) accents
Got a friend from Chicago and he has a cool accent as well
Americans, and anyone else, making fun of Britain
Only we can do that god damit
I think no country should be ridiculed if it isn't for something recent
Making fun of people for something they didn't live is just so dumb !
Also I'd like to say thank you to everybody who said that the "French surrender" joke isn't funny
Like some people say: we hate you all the same way <3
Nazi jokes about Germany
Switzerland: Don't touch to our french bros, but shitting on those bloody Bourbine is ok
Belgium: only french can make fun of them
Every other european countries except England: one or two little jokes is ok, but no insult or annoying jokes
England (not UK, just England): Don't care
Germany, partly because I spent part of my childhood there
Any type of "Club Med" thing
Belgium, as a French I love this country
The whole debt crap with Southern Europeans is incredibly irritating, and the Brexit thing has more than had its run
I'm also always quite defensive of Québec
Thank you, friend
Voltaire's quote about the HRE is quite the bon mot though
And I don't even like Voltaire
Re: the Bielefeld thing
why ? I've heard ot that joke, but I don't get it ?
Italy !
With exceptions for the Scottish, the Irish, and I guess the Welsh
Yeah but I do love my fucking baguettes though
Did you guys just tried to marry us this whole time ?
Not just nowadays
Not original though
*start to cry*
Matou, which is a cute way of saying my name “Mathieu” , the -ou suffix makes things cute in french, and also is a word for “tomcat”.
My mom (algerian) would call me « mehza l’kehla » which mean « black goat » (which is actually, believe it or not, a cute nickname lol) ! I think it’s the equivalent of saying someone is a « black sheep » but it’s actually positive, just means you’re unique
She’d also call me « mazouziya », which means « the cherished one ».
My first name is Frédéric
My father often nicknamed me as "Alfred".
Also my older brother is named Florent, so he was "F1" and I was "F2". Yeah, that caused some psychological issues up to this day
"ma puce" (my flea), "ma biche" (my doe) or "ma cocotte" (my hen)
I know it sounds weird in English but it's fairly common in French
My dad always called me "Ma (petite) puce". Means "my (little) flea", sounds weird but it's just a normal way to say "sweetie" in French
No nickname for me but my mother called my nephew "Crapaud" which means "Toad" in English
It's not a common nickname and it doesn't sound cute but my nephew really liked it
Mistinguett
That was the scene name of an actress and singer from the late 19th century/early 20th
My mother called me "Ma Puce" (My flea), and my brother "Mon bonhomme" (My good guy)
On cats, my siblings & I are “chaton” ou “chatoune” (little male cat, little female cat)
Plus a bunch of nonsensical individual nicknames
Yes, the good thing about biblical names is that they are translated in many languages
Hahaha ! Ok, just googled it, seems terrifying
I wanted to learn Greek but I didn't find a lot of websites/apps, as I know that Duolingo isn't great :( I found Drops but that's all
Back when I was in uni (late 2000s) there was a new, modern app/website backed/endorsed by some fairly famous comedian
I can't recall the name of their the fella or the app but it was all the rage in those pre-Duolingo days
Does that ring any bell at all
Thank you !
I watched it ! It's very useful for pronounciation
It's illegal to become a state worker if you have a criminal record, but you can become a politician and get elected even if you have one
That's bullshit
Commercials aimed at little children
No company should have the right to manipulate a child's mind
Also "convenience euthanasia" of pets
If it's done for convenience, it's not euthanasia, it's an act of cruelty
A lot of things
SUV cars (and ultimately all non-electric vehicles), non-bio food, non re-usable plastic, a shit lot of pesticides, non free-range animals (how is it still legal to sell meat from animals who have tortured their whole life
), investments in fossil fuels, coal, industrial fishing, ...
Lobbying, circumsition without medical reason, use of violence made by police during protestation, ritual slaughter of animals (because they're alive and conscious) are the main things I'm thinking about
Not voting, not recycling
Farmed fish eat pellets made of wild fish
As long as farmed fish won't eat fish-free pellets, it isn't much better than wild fish
In my country, crime is synonymous with felony and doesn't include infraction and misdemeanor
There must be several languages making the difference, so maybe it was meant this way
It's been illegal in France for a while at least
In Brittany, France, we have the Ankou, an old myth about a skeleton wearing local outfits but in black, he has a scythe, an old undead horse with a chariot and he comes for the dead people
We have also la Dame Blanche ( the White Lady ) wich appears to you when you are probably going to die to warn you
It’s a modern myth iirc as a group of friends were in a car driving by night and suddenly a ghost young lady appeared on one seat in the back, screaming something like « careful
» and then disappeared
And she mades the driver avoiding something on the road
My grandfather comes from South-west France and was told the legend of the "raw leg" (jambe crue) which is basically a single leg with an eye and a mouth wandering in the forest at night eating lost children
Ridiculous monster but it still traumatizes generations and generations haha
Le voirloup, a satanical werewolf that can take the appearance of a rooster, boar, dog, cat
The satanical stuff is a bit creepy
Maybe be it’s a really dumb thought but could your Draugen be the inspiration of Skyrim’s Draugr ?
That’s very likely, I remember I was a kid when my dad told me about that story on a specific road near our home so I thought it was local folklore as I saw that story too on some festivals but indeed it could be just a local version of an old myth shared by Europeans cultures
Nice to know, thank you
That's an adorable image
Why the ear thing, though
Try Broadchurch next
I honestly don't know why they aren't more popular even in the South of France
I feel like I only see them outside of Europe
Me too
Tennant is awesome, he feels as natural as an eccentric alien as he does a washed up depressive detective
Well then if you haven't already, try **The Angel's Share** by Ken Loach
Exactly the same in every western European country, where I've been to parties (France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, etc
You usually bring something to drink with you as a gift for the host, who then proceeds to put everything that was brought in a single place where everyone just gets whatever they want
Have you watched River
It’s a very nice crime series from UK and I am surprised it is not more well known because it’s great
Yeah
Luther also is awesome
For *l'* it's obvious since it's for any word starting with a vowel
Still doesn't indicate if it's feminine or masculine
For *le/la*, [there are rules] depending on how the word ends, but also a lot of exceptions
So you can usually guess it right (more by feeling actually, I never learned these rules
), but there are always some words you have to look up because they don't fit the rules
There are a few words where the meaning changes if you change the article/gender (*le tour* = turn, *la tour* = tower)
Also, a few words that can be either, you can say both *un après-midi* (an afternoon) or *une après-midi*.
We know the gender of words, but only because we made repeated mistakes as kids and got corrected on the spot
Most of time I'd say yes, as there rules that can be applied to find a words article
That being said , some words are just weird, and people use the wrong article even with super common words they've been using for ever
Also, a few words which change gender when they’re plural (“un bel orgue” but “de belles orgues”)
Fun fact
Vagina is masculine in French
Dick is feminine
_But_ pussy is feminine
And penis is masculine
This show is even worse than I thought
“Vagin” comes from the Latin name for sheath
Nouns’ genre are usually not determined by their meaning, but by their etymology
And the man who claims to possess a woman’s vagina is about to become single
Well if you want to unite, you all have a common enemy, Nutella is masculine in French
We have them in "interesting" places: on the side of hikes, close to a good view, etc
I don't think that's a thing in France but there's usually always somewhere to park your car
We only have car parks in places of interest
For everything else, it is accepted to just park your car on the side of the road
Yes we have a franco-german channel named Arte that broadcasts about 50% of german productions (movies and shows)
The brits also send us doctor who each year
I do not watch a lot of TV but I guess we have a bit of others countries too
Well we have Arte which is a channel mixed between good French documentaries and boring German films uwu
From a French who watches a lot of afternoon cheesy TV-movies, the most we have are American ones (especially Hallmark movies from early November to February), but yeah I think German is second
I love Arte
It's probably the best channel we have
Eeeh wieso habt ihr die guten Filmen und wir haben die Deutschen
Yeah cobra 11 has also been on french TV for a very long time, I use to watch it coming back from school every day
Naja denn ich würde gerne besser echt nach Deutschland fahren für ein Austausch
That we are surrendering cowards
Man I can't stand this one, it's more of a free pass to insult us than a stereotype or a joke
I don't care about the rest of them, like yeah we love our baguette even though we don't necessarily wear striped sweater, that's harmless though
Can i nominate the same for both
Cuz that's "cheese-eating surrender monkeys" to me
Not the cheese part, of course we like cheese, maybe you would too if you knew how to make good one ;)
But international ribbing apart, the rest really gets to me
Both angers and frightens me how quickly it caught up, really hammers home how scarily efficient the USian propaganda machine can be when it comes to justifying war (and look how appropriate it is again
Every other decade like clockwork)
And on the other hand, I'm amused because, well, us Frenchies becoming internationally reviled for
refusing to go to war
For declining to invade a middle eastern country for made-up reasons
For opposing war hawks
Holy fucking shit, I don't think anyone would have seen this one coming
So there's a fair bit of irony there as well
The surrender thing is unbearable
We have one of the best army in Europe, if not the best, it makes no sense regarding our history and our current presence in several battlefields
All the other things are fine, we are rude, Paris is dirty and we are pessimistic
That France is full of gay people
Obviously said by offended homophobes who only visited some parisian areas which are well known as gay districts
There's a strong gay subculture here but it doesn't mean that France is LGBT heaven
French LGBT people are victims of daily discrimination and crime just like in the rest of Europe and I wish some people realized this
And also that French women are hairy
Not at all a true stereotype as most French women shave, but this is hilarious
France:
Hate: the "all cowards" and "always surrender"one
Members of my family like many are still suffering of the lost of a love one or the consequences of the war
(My grand mother is still afraid of the sound of boots in the street for exemple and still can't talk about her brother, a resistant who was shot at the age of 17
The white flags memes and others are above EVERY video or article about france
it's start to be anoying now
Funny one: all women are slim, well dressed and elegant
Clearly those who said that never saw me, especially me on a sunday morning
(please feel free to correct my english
I'm working on it ;)  )
I gave it a chance as a young innocent boy starting secondary school, which means I enrolled for German classes for 9 years
And yeah it was hard (having a terrible teacher to start with didn't help) but like you said, it can be easier for someone who knows a germanic language, or speaks one as a native
Personally I could never figure out how to chose between ein, einer, einen, das, die, der etc
probably because it is one of the first thing we're supposed to learn and the teacher's method was "here, learn this dialog by heart and repeat it".
I guess it's as hard for us to learn German as it is hard for you to learn French, or any latin language maybe
I stand with you on the "German is an ugly language" front
It's mostly because most people are first exposed to it through old recordings of an angry Austrian who we tend to think more or less as the Devil Incarnate I think
I find German beautiful for its elaborate but extremely pleasing (to me) grammar, as opposed to English's brutish (again, to me) simplicity
Here we have an expression you  could categorize as a stereotype
"Être saoul comme un Polonais" (Being as drunk as a Polish)
That one might come mainly from us
To be honest, I've never been to the UK nor tasted any of your food (that I know of) and I still feel there's some truth to that stereotype
I'm not saying it's true, i'm saying i've been seing and I've heard all my life that it's the case, so it became somewhat true to me, even without any evidence
So I'm sorry, someday I'll visit the UK and hopefully be cleansed of that cliché.
I mean any stereotype that's just an excuse for an insult is detestable, just like this one
I just don't see the point behind it, it isn't funny, doesn't sound smart and in most case it's not even a product of hatred so it's hard to see a reason behind it appart from "remember that one time you lost LOL loser".
How many is too many
what about not enough
\^\^
The only stereotype here is the striped shirt though :p baguettes and wine aren't,  we do love them and consume them in large quantities, that's a fact
As for the rest, you're preaching the choir ahah
Yeah it mostly comes from them
The way lots of them see things is that America saved the day during 2 world wars when reality is very different
TBF, the "always on strike" stereotype is true
I take the bus for work and you can be sure bus drivers will be on strike monthly for several days or longer
It's very annoying
Yeah that's the "source" of the stereotype, but shit like that happened at least once to any country, kingdom or empire in its history, yet the "jokes" are for us
Yes I hate that one and I don't understand where it came from because cheating isn't acceptable here
Marinières (striped shirts) are much more popular in France than elsewhere though
They're not ubiquitous, certainly, but there is a basis for it as well
France didn't send 11 thousand Frenchmen to serve in the SS
They were volunteers, big difference
This is directly tied with the interwar French political landscape and our surrender
France did collaborate but it didn't fight for the Axis
That's like staying Sweden was an Axis power
Hey, maybe german needs more roundabouts to sound pretty :p just kidding
For the number I see your point, even though for us it just sounds normal
For instance quatre-vingt, when you're learning our language you see as 4 20, but for us it's just a word for 80, we don't think 4 20 we just say it, and think it like a single word katrevin lol I don't have enough knowledge as to why it has come to this, I just know that it's based on 20 rather than 10
As for your level of French, I am in the same exact situation with German, which is a shame
All these years going to class after class of it to come out unable to speak it, what a waste of time
I wish I was actually able to speak German as good as I do English
Same thing for me with german, I had terrible grades, the teachers didn't really care much nor question herself about it so I thought "fuck it" too and stopped even trying
Then in high school I had a better teacher, and managed to have better grades around 10/20 (below ten is bad, 10 itself is "la moyenne" the middle ground, it's ok, not great)
I honestly have no clue ^^
Oh I believe you, like I said the only reason I "believe" in that sterotype is that it's been repeated endlessly to me for my whole life
There shit food and great food in any country in the world
I mean, if your answer to "UK food is shit" is "But you can get Indian food there !", maybe that's not much of a counterpoint
I think only WWII, since we didn't lose or surrender nor didn't get invaded during WWI even if most of the fights took place on French soil
And yeah the comparison is accurate, yet we're the only ones widely mocked about a loss that way
It comes a lot from the US but if we were to make a joke of the same level, they would lose their shit
Just imagine the shitstorm it would create if we were to spread jokes about them based on 9/11 or something like that
There's always a basis for a stereotype, it just becomes exagerated like it is the case of marinières, but you're probably right that it's more popular here
I mean it had its glory hour some decades ago that must have given birth to the sterotype, and we can still see someone wearing one once in a while
True, but a stereotype is usually exagerated
There's no exageration when it comes to baguettes and wine \^\^
Why are you doing this to us
You know what they say, history is written by the victors
Yeah, it's a joke, about  one of the worst things that happened to France and Europe, repeated over and over and over and over again everytime French are even brought up
But sure, we wont take it seriously
When I see the surrender jokes I always wonder how they would react if we made jokes about Americans soldiers being baby killers who lost to a bunch of rice farmers
Probably badly, but of course it's not the same thing when it's against them
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I mean I wouldn't like me being cheated on, I wouldn't like if a friend told me he cheated on his partner
But the President ? I couldn't care less, it's his private life
That's the stupidest thing I have ever read, and I read a lot
What did with English for me (because I wasn't that good at it in school) was series and music
Sadly i'm quite deaf now so there goes that
That's nice \^\^ now all we need is good teaching techniques ahah
Hey at least, learning German I got to come to your country for a schooltrip when I was a kid
Got drunk for the first time of my life in Wolfenbüttel on Jägermeister :D
Yeah that amplified it and made the insult kind of mainstream
Joke is on them, they have a president that collects every stereotypes we have about the US :)
Oh man you should try raclette ;) it's a type of cheese usually cut in slices, we melt the slices one by one in small pans with a special grill thing especially for it, and poor the molten cheese on charcuterie, potatoes, eggs etc
It's a winter thing, one of those you keep on eating until you're on the verge of death :)
Maybe you just don't notice them cause you don't care about them which is good
But these jokes are there everytime anyone speaks about anything french on internet
Its on reddit, in YouTube comments, on twitter, facebook
you can't seriously say anything about France without some idiot thinking he's a smartass coming up with this joke
I'm pretty good at ignoring that kind of shit, but this one comes up so often than it just makes me angry, it's my country, my culture and my history that's being shat on everytime I see that joke
You mean because the USA was in a proxy war against the communists, right ? We never asked their help, it was an independance war and I'm pretty happy we stopped it
Not our fault if they were in a cold war with Russia and China
Sure let's punish a whole country because of the actions of corrupt politicians and traitors while De Gaulle and the free armed forces of France and the resistance kept fighting to liberate the country
truth is De Gaulle fought to restore a French government, and played the allies leaders just right to ensure there would be no obstacle to that goal
Anyway, that's not the subject at hand and that's where I stop feeding the troll
Never been to strasbourg, but definitely will go within the year  ^^ spanish is a nice language, although I don't like it spoken by spanish people, sounds agressive and loud to me, but my girlfriend is Mexican and sounds wonderful ahah
I'm not in school anymore, so german is a long gone memory to me
Point is that contrary to the USA, we weren't only fighting in Vietnam, but in Indochina (Vietnam + Cambodge + Laos)  so our battlefield was 3X bigger
Our Army and our population were ridiculous compared to the military strenght of the USA
We don't joke about the "cowardise" of the USA
They do
Because it's so funny to joke about the dead soldiers of their allies
&#x200B;
At first, it was a classic independance war between France and Indochina ( 1946 et 1949)
The French gouvernment wanting to let it go (the war was very impopular in France), but it then became a proxy war in 1950 between the USA and the communists after the begining of the Korea war (1950) and the etablisment of the Communist China (1949)
The USA gave us a lot of weapon and asked us to fight against the communists
The war became way more brutal, with a lot of casualities
&#x200B;
At the end, the french government said "fuck you with your proxy war, if you want to fight, you have to go to the battlefield
We wasted to much time for this shit"
No worries,  I liked reading you get carried away ahah and I agree, it is a beautiful symbol of the beautiful thing that has been done to fix our countries relation, I'd say it's miracle
To think of the shit we put each others through and now we're like best buds, that's crazy and a real treasure
I've talked with chinese and Korean people, and theres still hate towards the Japanese for shit that happened during wars, even among young people, this would be unthinkable nowadays between us, or even between France and England
As for my girlfriend, I haven't faced the mexican wrath yet, good communication, but honestly I kind of want to see it someday ahah
No problem, every opportunity to learn is to be taken ^^ Not great in 20th century myself, especially WWII, I mean I know enough, but I kind of feel harassed by it : too many documentaries about it, it's omnipresent in our lives since we're kids
I get it is important to make sure we won't repeat the past, but at some point you know "yeah yeah, I get it".
As for Japan, that's a good analysis, but I don't know what their logic is
When I look at it, I see a country trying to blind itself of the crimes of the past, but maybe not for bad reason
They vowed not to ever go to war again, and seems maybe they just want to be the post war Japan and erase a shameful past
I don't know, again not enough knowledge of these times
0-15°: winter jacket
15-20°: sweater and a light, mid-season jacket on top
20-25°: t-shirt and a light jacket, because a cool breeze can still happen
25°+: t-shirt and a light jacket or hoodie nearby (but not on my shoulders) just in case of wind/harsh sun
That works well for a French southerner
I would say 24 degres, under I would only be confortable in the sun but if I'm in a shadow  place with a bit of wind I would be a bit cold without moving
It depends on the wind strength really
Overall I'm really resistant to the cold
I hate to be warm and I wear only a t-shirt or a shirt as soon as I can
Anything above 5° (sometimes even lower on mornings when I know it will be acceptable during the day), I'll only wear a t-shirt, because I can't bother carrying a sweater or a jacket all day
Most of the time I'll forget it anyway
I have a sweater I brought at work about 3 weeks ago, still there on my desk chair because I systematically leave it there at the end of the day
Also, I live in the Alps and haven't worn a winter coat in like 3 or 4 years, even with deep freezing temperatures
A hoodie with a scarf is generally as dressed as I'll go
add a good 5° and you get the scale for france
edit: south france to me at least
I'd say after the attacks in 2015 it feels different, mostly because there are a lot more military/police in the streets
We had the 2015 attentat, so there is a ultra-security atmosphere, in the law and in protocols
We also learned that a "great democracy" could be ruled by one political party, and that government could mutilate protesters, and even kill 2 of them, without any consequences
But at least we won the world cup
Crimea against cheese, ok putin ?
Tbh apart from seeing some soldiers in airports or train stations not much has changed for me, although we must be careful of potential laws that reduce freedom for the sake of safety
More security everywhere, but except that not that much today
There is all the hidden side of security, like massive surveillance of internet, laws about searching the houses, ect
I would not include extremism rise as a cause of the attacks
It is really a global phenomenon which started before 2015 in France
France got the euro in 2002 and the price in francs are still written on the notes ahah
If ever you need someone to make a government, we can always give you François Hollande
[He's super cute] and he doesn't bite, not too high mileage, a real bargain
It's a an alert system that can be activated at several levels
Currently in France, it
1) allows soliders to patrol in the street (it is called the Opération Sentinelle - the soldiers are complaining about it because of the job isn't what they signed for and mainly because it is highly tiring and stressful as they have to always to walk in full equipment, to look after each civilian considering them as a possible terrorist, not knowing what they legally can do as they are not policemen AND being the first target of terrorists and crazy people)
2) raise the security and controls when you are in public places
For instance, schools now have as many training against terrorist attacks (flee or hide) as against burning
Since 2015, I, as a student, have had one or two every year
Here is an article dealing with the fact that Opération Sentinelle soldiers are a target :
There is the same thing in France
Since 1996, 30-40% of the music displayed has to be French
There are exceptions with cultural radio station who can avoid them and for instance Nostalgie, a radio playing historic famous music, which has a 60% quote
Perfect nickname, I'll keep it too ha ha !
For the bad condition of work, I am unable to find a great article regarding this but the unfortunately frequent suicides in the army trigger debates regarding this
For the difference between police and the army a relevent example is the 13th of november of 2015 attacks
The Plan Vigipirate was at his maximum level following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in january (against the satire magazine)
Therefore the Opération Sentinelles were patrolling this night
They arrived quickly at the Bataclan
Nevertheless they did not intervene as the Préfecture de Police (the Police higher instance) refused
They were not trained to and it was not "a war zone". La BAC (Brigade anti-criminalité, urban police) was already on the scene and were trained to this type of intervention
The soliders had order to shoot only if the terrorists came out down the street as it would be légitime défense (Right of self-defense or here protecting the people)
However the 8 soldiers declined to hand them their FAMAS (former French war weapon - sadly given up for a sh*tty german gun but it's not the debate) because they were not allowed to
The BAC couldn't intervene without them as the terrorists had Kalashnikov
It ended up being the BRI and the RAID (two of the several units that could be compared to the American SWAT) who went in
NB : I am not trying to prove anything with "what if" I am just saying soldiers are not policemen
For my fellow French speaker, an article on the event
13 novembre 2015 : pourquoi les militaires de « Sentinelle » ne sont pas intervenus au Bataclan
We have:
\-Vercingétorix: Celtic gaul leader who fought against Julius ceasar
\-Charles Martel: who kicked the omeyad infidels out of France
\-Charlemagne: Unified a large part of Europe
\-Joan of Arc: French maid who bitch-slapped the brits out of France
(Before getting deep-fried on a stick
\-Napoléon: Bitch-slapped all european monarchies before getting punched in the face by Russia winter
\-George Clémenceau: Badass french politician and he did a lot to win WWI
He was called "The tiger" because of his ferocity
\-Jean Moulin: The most well-known French resistant during Nazi occupation of France
\-Charles de Gaulles: Like Clémenceau but during WWII
\-Arnaud Beltrame: Policeman who died in 2018 during a terrorist attack after he saved all the hostages (he was not in uniform and had no weapons on him)
This guy is a fucking hero
EDIT: Added Charles Martel and Charlemagne
In 2005, there was a TV show in France that ranked the "greatest" Frenchmen of all time
It's a highly subjective topic and it suffers from recency bias but I think it's a pretty accurate list overall
The top 5 are :
**Charles de Gaulle
** Leader of the French resistance movement during World War II and President of France between 1958 and 1969
Admired for leading the French resistance, and giving post-war France international prestige and independence in their foreign policy
**Louis Pasteur
** Chemist who discovered vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization
Developed vaccines against rabies and anthrax
**Abbé Pierre
** Priest who was a member of the Resistance movement during World War II
Founder of the Emmaus movement, which helps poor and homeless people
**Marie Curie
** Physicist and chemist
Co-discoverer of radioactivity, radium and polonium
First woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics (1903) and Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911) and the only person to have won both
**Coluche
** Comedian, actor and humanitarian activist
Founder of the Restaurants du Coeur, a non-profit charity movement who distribute food to the needy and help people out with finding housing
[Here] is the rest of the list
Jean Bart
Every year, on multiple occasions, we all knee together holding our arms and sing his glory
Where I came from, we only knee for him, none else
(French) We have several but I’d say one of them is Jean Moulin
First leader of the resistance against Germans during WW2, he was captured and horridly tortured to death and still didn’t say a thing
Charles Martel and Charlemagne can be added too
In my city the hero we have above all of them is Jean Bart
Voltaire, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, Emile Zola, Baudelaire, Rimbaud
Why do we keep forgetting our artits, poets, philosophs, writers
? :(
What about Lech Wałęsa ?
What about Kaiserin Sissi
Would you count her as a Bavarian
He is still a potato in a bed or did he get better ?
True
I've edited my post
The whole sea thing was always a problem for us
Can they be considered like hero
Then we should also include our great scientists:
Laplace, Lamarck, Sadi Carnot, Pasteur, Pierre et Marie Curie, Lagrange, Cuvier, Lavoisier, Ampère, Navier, Broca, Becquerel, Coriolis, Cauchy, Levy, Mandelbrot
She was born in Poland but later became a French citizen
Yep, you're right !
Personally, I believe this people (and some other people we havent mentioned yet like Molière and Mozart) to be heroes
Because in the end, art and culture prevails
didn't knew that
I went to Gdansk once and they were selling lot of goodies in tourist shop about him and the solidarnosk, I though he was some kind of well loved working class hero
He has a statue and place named after him in Nice, France
N'empêche, le héro le plus glorifié de France ça reste Jean Bart
À Dunkerque ça fait quand même genre 170 ans que tout les ans, sans exception, on se met à genoux devant sa statue pendant le carnaval et on chante la "Cantate à Jean-Bart", qu'on connait tous par coeur
Chaque Carnaval se fini par ce chant à la gloire de Jean Bart, et vu que ça dure tout les samedis soirs et les dimanches pendant 2 mois, ben ça fait beaucoup de fois où on se met à genoux et on chante à la mémoire de Jean Bart
En plus à Dunkerque, le surnom de la ville c'est "la cité de Jean Bart", les dunkerquois c'est "les enfants de Jean Bart"... y a pas beaucoup de héros qui ont une bande de gens bourrés et déguisés qui chantent sa mémoire 2 mois par an, systématiquement depuis plus de 150 ans
Tbh both of my great grandparents that were alive during WW2 don't want to talk about this period
Beside that I guess I had a grandfather who participated during may 68
My grandfather was a priest, a missionary priest sent to Africa to convert people to Christianity
As far as I know, he went to Morroco, Senegal and Cameroon
I've found a visa to Cameroon and a vaccination paper from Casablanca
He was then part of the whole French colonization machine, at the end of it
He was then fired of the order, married my grandmother and became a writer at Gallimard
During the 2nd war he didn't fight, he went south with the rest of his school who made priests
He died in 2000
I also found prisoner camp tickets from my other grandfather (that I never knew, died in 87), from a German camp
I keep them in my wallet
So, Great-grand-father died in Germany in 1941 and was in a cavalery regiment before that (part of those captured in Dunkirk)
I had a grand-father that was sent in Algeria, he spent time as a "Ambulancier" (don't know  the exact word in English sorry), he never wanted to spoke about it, so I don't have much more info sadly
Otherwise I don't have much informations about my ancestors
My grandfather was in the war of Algerie
That's it
Had a great uncle who disappeared in Verdun, he was listed as MIA and never was heard of again
We assume his body is still there under a field somewhere
My grandfather was an artillery NCO during the debacle in Belgium, they were waiting for an allied unit they were supposed to support and a panzerdivision showed up on their rear instead
They got captured without any realm chance to fight and he spent the rest of the war in a pow camp
One of my uncles was infantry in a colonial unit and was not in mainland France when France surrendered
I know his unit was with Free French forces but he was a humble person and always pretended like nothing much happened and it would have been indelicate to of me to press him
The only thing he would talk about was the drill
The Franco-Prussian or world wars aren't particularly interesting since *everyone* fought in them
The guy with the most interesting life is my great great uncle (my great grandfather's younger brother) who was a Catholic missionary in China from the 1920s to the late 40s or so
He saw the Warlords Era, the Japanese invasion, civil war etc
Eventually the diseases he got there (mostly malaria as I recall) forced him to come back to France and he became a parish priest around the ancestral village
He baptized and married pretty much everyone in the family until he died in the 70s.
I have ancestors who fought in WW1, on the western front
Sadly, I don't know much about that
Yeah that was not .I lived with my grandfather for almost 4years and when he was talking about it (it was rare) you could see that he has been "marked" by the war and that he was very upset about it, it was a very sensitive subject
Twice, under the Carolingians starting from Charlemagne and under Napoléon
Good food made with quality ingredients ; can be found in the US but is certainly not as commonplace as in most of Europe
Gun restriction laws
They
They do that
That's honestly horrible, I didn't know
The American sense of superiority is veeeery real on reddit
Also, it often translates as an anti-european feeling, especially in subs like r/askanamerican
Not a fan of olives as good but will admit the lack of olive oil is a real calamity
The Japanese didn't really like a Frenchman in charge of one of their national treasuries
In French we use a lot of them like «pressing »(dry cleaners ) « leggings »( tracksuit bottoms
Idk if its the correct translation) « jogging »(to go for a run )
« Brushing »( to get a hair blow dry)
« Happening »(an appearance on Tv)
And so on
It’s very confusing sometimes
All of these are also used in french with the exact same meanings
You guys can go to public protests and get out of it alive ? ;p
# /s
just in case
French too, with a whole lot of other nonsensical shit thrown in
Tear gas isn't exactly nice either
Let me try to do it with French word (some of them don't have translation though), between quote is the translation:
A la "fin de la semaine"(weekend), je cours au "place de stationnement"* (parking) près du tramway puis on va au bowling
Mais après des vacances au camping mes cheveux ont besoin d'un shampooing, où même un "relooking"** (makeover)
Si je ne peux pas le trouver, j'utilise mon talkie-walkie ou je t'envoie un "courriel/ courrier électronique" (email)
*This is a bit stretching because parking mean a place with a lot of "place de stationnement" (meaning one place where you can park)
**This something we call an "Anglicism" taking an English word and modifying it/using it in an other way than intended on English, shampoing is another one
If you want to order just plain tap water in a French restaurant or bar, specify "a pichet" (EDIT: or "a carafe d'eau") (*a jug*)
Otherwise the waiter will assume you're ordering bottled water, and you'll have to pay for it
Home salesmen, telephone salesmen
Most of  locksmiths plumbers and craftsmen that are on the first page of google (need to find real guys on specialised websites), gypsies who make you sign "petitions" for cash in Paris
People who ask you for anything (time, phone, money) on the street are necessarily ill-intentioned
At Charles de Gaulle airport, there is a guy who has been having fun for years making tourists believe that he is 20 to 60€ short of a plane ticket to go home and overly generous tourists fall for it
He manages to earn tens of thousands of euros a month and the police can do nothing despite all the attempts because lying is not illegal according to the (lax) judges
Never EVER give your money to the two olds gipsy ladies in Annecy
I used to
Then one day i Saw them with the last brand new iphone
I'm a bit curious, where are you from
For me in France you don't really ask for water in restaurants, you usually get water even if you don't ask for it
I was actually surprised when going abroad (in Italy for example) where I got a bottle when I said "I'm good with water" as I would say in France when I don't want any special drink
Though I can imagine it being a tourist trap that we common French people are immune to
What ? I just ask water, and they never bring me bottles
Where do you live ?
We have the same, especially around train stations
If you sign they will pressure you into donating, and if you get your wallet out, they will either steal it or just take whatever they want in there
And spoiler alert: they're not really deaf
I think a lot of people would just give them money to avoid further confrontation, whether they know they're being scammed or just confused
You can say "carafe" instead, if it's easier
The t in pichet is silent, it's pronounced pichè basically if that helps
Une bouteille will be interpreted as wanting bottled water, which won't be free
* Everything is focused on the marks
* Foreign language courses are a disaster
* There is a big problem with learning mathematics
When i was in school the thing that was blatantly abusive was how they were insisting on the impossibility for us to find a job if we didn't have high school end exam and how little our prospect were if not doing the choice to go to an university
Nothing was said in most of our scholar curriculum about professional school or tech school
For most parent those school were deemed as the school for the retards, the kids who can't do anything and that's it
I learned more English on Internet than at school
Many interesting subjects (History, Philosophy, French) are taught in a boring way
The way we teach English and the way we discourage students to participate or express their own point of view (I don’t know how to get the fancy little flag, but I’m french)
" • Everything is focys on the marks
This is absolutely true
In France, it doesn't matter if you have learned something or not at school, the only important thing is to have good marks, nothing else matters
The difference with school systems from neighboring countries is striking (especially with Germany)
That's why you can see that usually, french students are less open-minded and have a bad self esteem compared to their neighbors
On the part on English, it's a common critic in France but to be honest the school teaches all the boring things you wouldn't learn by yourself so easy : irregular verbs, basic tenses, introduction to culture
Maybe you learnt a lot on the Internet but without those basis I bet it wouldn't have been so easy for you
Had countless panic attacks because of that
That's so true, the first day of a summer camp in USA the director ask me to stay with him every time he will had to speak to someone because he wasn't speaking a word of English
I was 15 and him 40
The current level in general is not good and I see this in engineering school
I think that English cuisine in general is judged too severely (and I am French
It might not be the most delicate cuisine in the world but it doesn't taste nearly as bad as one would be lead to believe
The traditional dishes are nice in a homey if slightly unrefined way
German bread was very good
I tasted different types of bread and they were delicious
I'm only now realising that my comment sounds a bit like a backhanded compliment
Oh well, a compliment is a compliment, backhanded or not
Some regions in Italy do eat frogs ? Interesting
Lettuce can be parboiled then fried in a pan with olive oil, garlic
A common plate found around the Mediterranean sea that allows you to eat almost any edible leaves, such as dandelion or bitter lettuce
There isn’t really
Nowadays the fleur de lys flags is associated with monarchists but they are not really seen as hate symbols even if a lot of monarchist groups are quite close to far right so you won’t necessarily be seen as a Nazi for flying one at your balcony, you will most likely be seen as a weird guy that is very conservative and probably very catholic
There isn't really one that is not appreciated except the Vichy regime flag
Maybe there are more but can't think of right now
I like it better tbh (the monarchist flag)
looks like a bad rip-off of Mexico
It's a really cool design
As I said while it's used by some far right organizations it's not considered an hate symbol
[Napoleonic bee is also very cool]
There isn’t really, they kept the same flag
Petain had a personal flag with a double sided axe but I think a lot of French have only seen it once in history books at school and would not really know what it is today
Those who would know of it would definitely think that you are Nazi dick for flying it though
I didn’t include it initially because it never was an official symbol of France and a lot of people don’t really know of it
Our navy's flag was entirely white, not the country's flag
Probably not, for a nationalist like Le Pen, Pétain is nothing more than a traitor
(actually he is considered a traitor by most people, not without good reasons)
>a rumor that someone got AIDS this way scared us off
I think it involved an other kind of fist shenanigan
We had this game involving digital stopwatchs, two people face each other with a watch in their hands and try to stop the watch at a round number (1''00 for instance), if you manage to do that you can slap your opponent
And repeat until one gives up
-Could you say something in French ?
-Quelque chose en français
-Woah, that's beautiful ! What does it mean ?
-Something in french
Comment est votre blanquette ?
I usually go with:
"Ok, super, mais qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?"
*"Ok, great, but what do you want me to tell you ?"*
So what's the grudge with FYROM precisely ?
Okay we can't do that but you can get Corsica back (corsican included)
If only Belgium existed when fries were invented
Hahaha, it is tho
[The university of Liège admitted the french were indeed french in 2019
It's ok, you invented the double-fried french fries tho
Your method is way better
We try
But they never seem to remember
We give your fries 2 stars bruvz
[Une recherche de l'université de Liège de 2019 a conclu que les frites sont bien d'origine française
] Ironique, hein ?
Et donc je mérite un bas vote pour avoir répondu à une blague
Tu n’as peut être pas très bien dormi toi hier soir
J'ai pas basvoté. Je suis mois meme à -1
Quelqu’un d’autre a très très très mal dormi hier soir alors
La Bonne Paye : At the beginning of the game you get your money for the month (salary), and the goal is to still have money at the end of the "month" (once you have gone through all 30 cases of the board, each representing a day: going shopping, rents, stuff like that)
Then there's also Les Loups-Garoux de Thiercelieux
It's a card game so I'm not sure that it counts, but it's a popular game
Each player gets assigned a card with who they are in the village (Werewolf, Witch, Regular villager, etc)
During the night, werewolves will kill villagers, and during the day, the villagers select someone they believe to be a werewolf to kill
The main goal of the game is to lie and try to stay alive by not revealing your role (werewolves will kill you if you are someone important like the Witch, who can bring someone back to life once and kill someone once, and the village will obviously kill you if you are a werewolf), while also killing the players on the opposite side
The game is a bit more complex than that, but those are the basics
It's a really, really fun game and my favorite one
"La Bonne Paye", I live in france
we have "Le Milles Bornes"
In France we have Tarot and Belotte, two card games that have similarities with Bridge
The first one can be played from 3 to 5 players (but the tournament rules are for 4 players), and uses a deck of 78 cards
The second one is only for 4 players and is played with a deck of 32 cards
In Tarot depending on your cards you can decide to play against all the other players, which is difficult but brings you lots of points if you succeed (the winner being the one with the more points after several games)
In Belotte you play one team of 2 against one other team of 2
In France we have the same, called "jeu de l'oie" (lit
"game of the goose", but sounds like "game of law")
i love this game !!
Looks similar to toc, but it's not a very famous game in France I believe
Also, two card games are really popular :
-	Tarot (with a special deck of 78 cards)
-	Belotte and belotte coinche
One of the most frustrating games ever \^\^
Basically you have to reach the end of a 1000km road by playing cards (a "50" card makes you move 50km)
Except you can't move if the traffic lights are red, and they tend to stay red for a very, very long time
In France, Lille, probably
And they are right to ignore it
Toulouse on the contrary, is an underrated city
Nantes perhaps
It's the 6th most populated city in France
Admittedly, I find that surprising myself
Oh, I can chip in here
Banska Bystrica, Povaska Bystrica, Poprad, Cicmany (a village, I know) and another place whose name I can't remember, but we visited a 'bethlehem' there
Žilina has a football team in champion's league sometimes, so it's definitely not unknown
I would bet most Americans who are aware of Bratislava’s existence is because of Eurotrip
Mainly famous because it does not exist, which made it a pretty famous city on internet (IRL it's definitely not so famous outside of Germany)
Most doesn't know mine , which is the 3rd (Lyon) too, except maybe for football lovers
Marseille is a little bit more famour
People generally only knows Paris, Nice and maybe Bordeaux of the wine
My experience of Essen was an open air metal festival on a large square in front of the church/cathedral, on a Sunday
Which was remarked upon by one of the bands, aptly named "Hell". Slight amusement ensued
Otherwise yeah it felt like any generic mid-sized German city
Even in France, it's famous for being an ugly city
Yeah it's probably in the first 5 or so UK cities that'd spring to mind
For those interested, [this cool BBC documentary] about the origins of the genre spends some time talking about the city and its influence on the music
True true true
Toulouse sounds like To lose
Or too loose
I was thinking it is the reason it resonates to British ears
Don't hesitate to travel during winter, there are several ski resorts close by
My very personal opinion: It is a depressing place
Ssshhh keep the secret
Villeurbanne is almost the subburbs of Lyon
150,000 souls, I wouldn't call that a big city
They are doing ok, thank you for asking
Not so many public burnings in Rouen lately, though
> Genua
I am confused, did the Discworld join the EU
It's not the suburbs, it's in Lyon, the only frontier is administrative, it's the 10th arrondissement, really
If by cultural life you mean inbreeding habits and endemic alcoholism, yes
Lille inner city yes, but the urban area must be around 1 million with Roubaix Tourcoing and the smaller cities conforming the [metropolitan area]  of Lille
Haha, I had no idea, I was 100% sure it was a typo
TIL as well I suppose
Empire austro-hongrois ou l'Autriche-Hongrie
Autriche-Hongrie
L'empire Austro-Hongrois
It's about the same as in english
Empire Austro-Hongrois
Empire Austro-Hongrois in French
We complain about everything and get nothing done
We choose to instaure something and then we complain about it, we are lazy, people from Paris are always in a hurry, and we surrender in ww2
Hmmmmm
I am from France and people say that all french people smokes
It is fucking sadly true
The problem is I am almost the single one to not smoke in my family
BUT
Moreover, while others smokes, It seems like I am alergic of cigarettes
When someone smokes near to me (in the same room etc
), My nose get fucking stuffed so I can't breath so I breath stronger and stronger so my throat dies
Moreover, when I say my ma' She is hurting me and that I hate it, she mocks me like : Uuh, you are faking this, blablabla
Another sadly true stereotype is that french people doesn't speak english well
I Think it can be pretty true
In my class, at school, only a minority would be able de speak english goodly
We eat baguette everytime
We have a lot of smokers
You find cigarette butts everywhere on the sidewalks and it's kind of depressing
Vaping is getting more and more popular with the youth though so that's a plus
Also we don't pick up our dog shit
It's not exactly culturally accepted (leaving your dog shit on the sidewalk is obviously frowned upon) and if you ask any french if he picks up his dog's shit he'll tell you he does but in a real life situation, if it's too inconvenient and nobody's watching, he just won't.
Actually, yes we complain a lot but we actually get shit done
French workers are among the most productive (in productivity per hour) in Europe
I would have said the same for French people
Why ?
I agree, except for the lazy part
To be fair, the people asking for something to be implemented are not the ones that will tend to be complaining about it afterwards
We're not a hivemind
That a 3rd trait : whenever French ppl manage to pull something cool, other French have to either ignore it or poop on it with a long list on why it's not impossibly perfect
We hold each other to impossibly idealistic standard, to the point of being detrimental
Which is more expensive to use than planes, so people take planes instead
Also it's highly uneaven, the middle of the country has no such system
Well it’s just me lol
Not every time I agree, but there are still people complaining about everything
So that's nice
Now that's a persistent cliché. We're in the lower part of the chart indeed, but it's not *that* significant, we're talking about less than an hour less than average, weekly, cf: [
Well done
^You ^twat <3
We are on our 5th *republican* constitution; the previous ones were adopted in 1793 (1st Republic), 1848, 1875, 1946
Our current Constitution, the Constitution of the French **Fifth** Republic, was adopted on the 4th of October 1958
Since then, it has been modified **24 times**.
Modifications of the Constitution are regulated by the article 89 of the Constitution itself, under the [Title XVI - On amendments to the Constitution]
A modification of the Constitution can be proposed by the President (on council of the Prime Minister) or by the members of Parliament
Out of the 24 modifications so far, 22 were proposed by the President
Both chambers of Parliament (National Assembly & Senate) have to adopt the text of the "constitutionnal law" (name of the text amending the constitution) in the same terms
Once this is done, the law can either be adopted by referendum (happened once, in 2000), or by the Congress (both chambers of the Parliament reunited in the Versailles Palace), where it requires 3/5 of the cast votes to pass
The Constitution cannot be modified if the territorial integrity of France is threatened; and the Republican form of the Government can't be changed either
2 modifications were a bit peculiar: the very first one (1960) was made using a special procedure pertaining the remnant of our colonial empire, which has been removed since
The second one (1962) is debated to this day: article 11 allows the President to submit a bill directly to referendum, by-passing Parliament
The Constitution only allows this procedure to be used in some domains, yet in 1962, Charles de Gaulle submited a constitutional reform directly to the French people, ignoring the procedure of the article 89
He was successful, and changed the method of election of the President of the Republic (from an *indirect* vote, to a *direct* one), which had a massive impact of the dynamics and balances of the institutions of the Republic (the French President is called a "Republican monarch" in some academic texts as a result)
He tried again in 1969, was rejected, and resigned as a consequence; no President has tried to pull this stunt again since
[Many times] especially in the 19th century when it was a rollercoaster
And it was done in every way possible and imaginable
Coups d'état, revolts, defeats in war etc
De nem lehet haragudni a kedves miniszterelnöktek ellen, ő olyan ártatlan néz ki
"écureuil"  from latin "scūriolus" taken form ancien greek "σκίουρος", made of  "σκὶα", "shadow",  and "οὐρά", "tail"
It may be hard to pronounce, I think the "euil" thing is tricky for non native speakers
And that's only by repeating, good luck from reading it
It's  "[e] if you know how to read this
Exporting weapons to countries forbidden by an European agreement
If I remember correctly, EU members signed an agreement saying that selling weapons to an authoritarian, totalitarian regime, a government involved in a civil war or conventional war, unstable politically, a government who is suspected to use it against civilians, is forbidden
Mostly the weapon sales, but it's not the only thing
Macron likes to paint an image for himself abroad that his government seems to have trouble following
in terms of environment for example, most measures put in place are on a local scale, not much has been done nationally
Same
And to Egypt too
Came here for this one
Also Egypt
In first year of med school, about half of the students go to a "prépa" to help better their chances in the 2nd year admission exam (15% where I go)
A good amount of students still have to do their first year a second time to pass
Jusqu'à l'année dernière, la première année c'était PACES, et tu pouvais payer 2000euros par semestre pour avoir une "prépa privée" en dehors de la fac qui te fournit les fiches de cours, des méthodes, des entrainements pour le concours etc
Et depuis cette année la première année c'est PASS ou LAS (et là plus de redoublement possible) mais peux toujours payer une prépa privée qui te donne les fiches de cours etc
Les facs essaient de contrer ça en créant des séances de tutorat par des élèves d'année supérieure pour une somme modique (30 euros)
Moi j'ai eu de la chance, on était la dernière promo paces a lille l'année dernière et ils nous ont laissé redoubler, donc maintenant on est un groupe séparé des PASS/LAS, genre la "paces residuelle" pour cette année. Et pareil, j'ai fait tutorat à cause du prix de la prépa !
It depends whether or not you have enough room on your shelves/on your fridge I guess
I’ve seen both, depending on the layout of the kitchen
Some people seem to store them in the fridge out of convenience mostly
I never put them in the fridge
Basically if it’s not in the fridge in the store I don’t put it in the fridge at home
I store them in the fridge to extend their life a bit
I don't like the idea of eating eggs stored at room temperature and near the expiration date, especially in Summer
Very surprised to see most people seem to store them in their fridge
I don't think I've ever encountered that, and it seems like a waste of valuable fridge space
This abomination called UHT milk ? I don't understand how some people drink that
The taste is awful
>Soup
Interesting, how do you use your eggs with a soup
Thank you, I'll try it next time I'm doing a soup
I didn't think about that, but my knowledge of asian cuisine is quite limited to be honest
Salted butter and butter
It spared me from having to pedantically correct people in French (since it's now officially legitimate), so I like that
It does sound wrong to me though, still
I was this close to upvoting you, and you had to go and ruin it
As long as we all agree that "croissant au chocolat" is nonsense, then fine
This is not a useless topic
This is a major national issue that needs to be discussed and solved
How can we be considered a civilized country when some people still say "chocolatine"?
Wait, so when people in North England invite people "for tea", it's for a full meal ?
Huh
I know pannetone (quite good), never heard of a pandoro, what is that ?
21st of June like in the rest of the world
I love that it's "pommes" in German, which comes from "pommes frites" in French but just means "apples". Because we call potatoes "earth apples". Languages are weird
The actual best combination is Nutella after eating some chips
Try it and you'll thank me later
And by chips I don't mean French fries
People are saying "la Nutella" ???
The fuck is wrong with them ?
Last trip to London I was struck with the infamy that is a *chocolate croissant*. That was just your standard pain au chocolat, mind you
A pandoro is like panettone but without the horrible raisins and other useless stuff inside
And bigger and more fluffy
Because Germans
La nutella sound like shit tho
Why does it make so much sense ?
>Pandoro
For someone who doesn't like raisins, this sounds lovely
I'd miss the raisins, but I gotta say a softer dough sounds pretty good
I mean the summer solstice has been called that since roman times, I wouldn't argue it's particularly a French thing or ever has been
I had no idea this wasn't considered the norm in all of the west, but happy to have learnt it
Saying "passes moi la nutella" sounds just
wrong
Now I personally don't put milk into my tea, but that microwave business is just rude
Our whole language is built around assigning randoms genders to things because it sounds better this way
So the fact that two words in -a don't have the same gender is nothing unusual
What are the songs from your country that always come up during karaoke
Les démons de minuit
That was the goto end-of-party song at my engineering school
[L’aventurier by Indochine ] another song everyone knows that comes up often
It's also used to signal the customers the bar/club is about to close
Yup
Played at weddings and basically anytime the clock strikes 1am at a party of some kind
I heard it was the song that is always played late at night for any party/wedding
Yeah it’s kinda funny actually, it’s about an Irish guy who goes to war (I think ?) and remembers his country and the Connemara
And it’s a pinnacle of French popular culture
Don’t ask me why, I don’t know
Edith : it’s actually not about going to war at all, but about a catholic Irish dude marrying his catholic Irish girlfriend and partying like there is no tomorrow with all their Irish friends
You have to forgive me, I had never listened to it while being sober so I had no clue what the words were about
Yeah it's a song about that place
The singer never set foot there
Go figure
Yes and the lyrics are pro United Ireland:
« They still believe that the day will come
It's very close, when the Irish
Will make peace around the cross
There, in the Connemara
They know the cost of war
There, in the Connemara
They don't accept
The Welsh's peace
Or the kings of England's one »
I'm glad Wonderwall was added after a Beatles song was added to the list, since it can't exist without the existence of the Beatles
Although we have trains that cross borders, we unfortunately don’t have any transeuropean train (that I know about) that crosses multiple borders
Se we have to use plane for long-distance travelling
price is probably the main factor for me
At longer distances, planes rapidly become cheaper, and also significantly faster
Plane:
* Usually 30 to 60 minutes to reach the airport
* 60 to 90 minutes of luggage drop off, security checks, and waiting time at the gate
* The flight itself
* 30 minutes dissembark and luggage waiting time
* 30 to 60 minutes to reach your final destination
Ultra minimum of 2 hours of non flying time, up to 3hrs45
Train:
* Usually 10 to 30 minutes to reach the station
* 15 minutes to reach the platform and your car
* Actual travel time
* 10 to 30 minutes to reach your final destination
Ultra minimum of 25 mins of non travel time, up to 75 minutes
You can start looking at the plane option when train travel times exceed 3 hours
Depends greatly how direct is the travel
For example to go from Paris to Toulouse (680km south) you don't go straight to it, you have to pass through Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast (580km south of Paris, 250km west of Toulouse) and the line between Bordeaux and Toulouse is a snail
So the train takes the same time as the more direct trajectory on the highway (maybe one hour less now with the newer Paris-Bordeaux line) and you just take the plane because 680km by plane is like 50min (and the price isn't that different either
On the other hand the trains that go to England, Netherlands and Belgium are direct so it seems like a normal travel
It happened to me to have a plane change at Amsterdam airport for a flight to Paris and consider actually finishing with the train instead
So to answer your question, depends how many train changes and how direct the train is
If I'm not going somewhere in France or Switzerland it's going to be plane or car
From Paris, I've been to London, Geneva, Frankfurt, Koln/Cologne, Bruxelles, Luxemburg, all within 5hours train
I used to take longer (6-7hours) ride to go to the south of France, but now the high speed train takes us there in 4ish, and with little kids, 7h would be a long ride
When I was young (80s, 90s) we were taking night trains to Italy, but the service dwindled
I think the French railway is trying to resurrect the service
I really like the train, I was able to make a round trip in Germany heavily pregnant and nobody asked when I was due or if the doctor agreed to my travel
I've visited the rest by car or bus, I hardly take planes within Europe, except to go in islands like Ireland and Cyprus, or Russia
And on transit to somewhere else of course
Wait
The Eurostar goes to Amsterdam ?
I thought it was only Paris-London
That’s awesome ! I thought the Orient Express was the only transcontinental train !
Secularism doesn't mean that the political party need to be non religious
If you represent the state, you can't promote a political, a religious  or a non religious ideology because the state is neutral
Deputies, senator and member of the government can promote a  political or religious ideology because they represent the people not  the state
As weird as it may sounds, I can't see the Eiffel Tower from my window
Military history
Anglo movies mostly
The last turd is "The King" from Netflix
You mean you don't spend your days saying "top o the mornin to ya"?
With your unreasonable love for cheesy romcoms, it's literally impossible you could be villains nowadays in any way
I don't even like red wine
I'm a disgrace to my country
To be fair, there is a small part of it in Lyon too
And Windmills
Yes of course, probably when I was around 5-6 years old ? And before that, I used to ride a tricycle, starting maybe at 3 or 4 years old ?
I know people who can't - or, perhaps more accurately, have never learned to - ride a bicycle
It's uncommon but certainly not unheard of
Yup
I learnt it at age 6 or 7
or maybe 8 I don't remember
No, I was never taught how to
Even though my brother was
The only people I know who can't or learned very late grew up poor or with too many siblings to afford bikes
A post nuclear war such as fallout where we will follow Swiss people leaving their bunker to discover how Europe become
I think doing a « Detroit: Become Human » type of game (multiple choices game with a large tree of possibilities) about the French Revolution would be pretty lit I think
Following a member of the National Assembly, a noble from Louis XVI’s cour, and a revolutionary provincial peasant
as a Noble we could choose to plot against the King, to serve our interests or rallying the people’s cause
as a member of the National Assembly, choosing between the Montagnard and the Girondins etc
as a revolutionary peasant, you could try to lead you own revolt in your region
One of the ending would be what actually happened and the others could be totally made up
The crusades, the Napoleonic empire, both World Wars
But my favorite might be the French Revolution before Napoleon's arrival to power
I would love to see one in prehistory time, when homo Sapiens arrived in Europe (from africa, via Asia) and found Neandertalian men already there, being physicly stronger but still more primitive and they needed to live together
They probably had some fight, some battle for hunting territories, we know they also had some barter and also had babies together
We call the Brits the "rosbif", it comes from "roasted beef", that's because it's how they look when they leave their country to go to France on Holiday and their skin sees the sun for the first time in months
Nicknames for countries :
* Germany : Outre-Rhin  (across the Rhine)
* Italy : la botte (the boot)
* United Kingdom : la perfide Albion (perfidious Albion)
We can also refer to anything Italian as "transalpin" (from across the Alps)
Some pretty offensive ones
* Germans : chleuhs or boches (widely used during WWI and II)
* Italians : ritals (apparently comes from the massive immigration of italian workers to France after WWII, their ID mentioned "R. ital
" for "réfugié italien", "italian refugee")
* British : rosbifs (from roast beefs)
* Portuguese : portos or guesh
English : Rosbif
German : Boche
Italian : Rital
Spanish : espingoin
Russian: russkof
Polish : Polak
These are not endearing surnames though, usually used in a negative way
«Boche», «Fridolin» and many more for the german
«Ritals» for italians
Possibly « Espingouin» for spanish
«Rosbifs» for englishmen
Their country as «Perfide Albion».
Rosbifs for brits, frenchified version of "roast beef", germans are "boches" (more or less pronounces bosh)
I've heard people in France referring to tourists from the North (England, the Netherlands, Germany and so on) as strawberry-vanilla ice creams, cause when they come in summer they get all red and white with sunburns and tanning marks
Interesting, as a french I’ve never heard that one
Is there a meaning behind it
Belgium is Outre Quiévrain
I would wager that it represents a lot of people, and since your demographics are a disaster, I advice you to reconsider, cugino d'oltralpe : )
Totally, we too, cheese eating surrendering monkeys, don't have offensive name for our British friends
I fail to see how since it's wrong
I stand corrected, that's from our American friends, you just call us frogs
Which is wrong
Says the Dane grinding his axe, ready to go to war over Skaneland any day against those bloody Swedes
Ha yeah, I can see how that would cause some confusion when not understanding a single bloody word they were saying but that one
Definitely and this shit needs to die
If you really want to insult us with something related to food, try snails
We focus on France, the Résistance and the Libération
The Eastern Front (Stalingrad mostly) is also a big part of the program for WW2, to  give an example of the atrocities of the war
Not much being said about the Pacific front, except the atomic bombs
In France it naturally focuses on the Occupation and the Collaboration, and also somewhat on the Resistance
By that we have recommended readings, like the [Appeal of 18 June] acts of Resistance hero [Jean Moulin] [Vichy government] atrocities such as the [Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]
Surrounding WW2, recommended novels are obviously "the Diary of Anne Frank", "If This Is a Man" by Primo Levi, and also ["The Silence of the Sea"] by Vercors, which is surely a Franco-French piece not very well known outside of France
It's a short story written during the Occupation by a French resistance nationalist
It's a very humanist book, that even humanizes the German occupier, and I highly recommend it if you can get your hand on it
A hugely popular French author from the second half of the 20th century called Robert Merle became famous with his 1952 book [Death is my Trade] which is a fictionalized biography of Rudolf Höss who was the commander of Auschwitz
It was recommended reading to me in middle school, and I discovered I could enjoy adult books with this one
Very shocking material though, as it's about how Rudolf Höss imagined efficient ways to the Final Solution
Once we're through with French-centric subjects, we naturally mostly focus on the Liberation thanks to American and British (and Canadian
and some French) forces
Sometimes we focus on Colonial forces because that's politically correct
We don't talk a lot about how important the Russian front was
We learn that got wrecked in the first round because of gross incompetence from our generals and then spent the rest of the war with a minority of people resisting the germans, a minority of people collaborating with the germans and a majority of people who had a hard enough time surviving that they felt like doing neither
Among other things I remember being shown the “Night and Fog” movie with quite moving footages from the camps
I might be blending my history courses with my personal reading on the subject, but here I go
We start the WW2 courses with the interwar period
As far as I can remember we've got a whole part of the history starting with a short intro in 1870 and then WWI, the interwar and finally WW2
In the interwar period we study a bit of French politics with the Front Populaire as well as the French mentality before the war
We see that France don't believe in an upcoming war
And that we were too proud of our victory in the WWI thus doing nothing regarding military
We study the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain too
But we mainly focus on Germany and the rise of Hitler
So we have infos about how he founded the NSDAP and how he rose to power because of the situation Germany was in because of the Treaty/diktat of Versailles
Then we have a short passage about French diplomats trying to meet Hitler to stop him invading Poland by sending warning messages
We had a brief intro to the German-Russian alliance I think
Then war, we focus on how the fact the Germans took the Ardennes to stomp us in 6 weeks and that we were absolutely not prepared
But we don't have infos on the various battles that occurred during that time
Then we study Vichy France and Resistant France a lot
We study a lot of propaganda, the cooperation of the French government with Nazis
The *rafles* , the way the Alsace-Lorraine's workers are used for German industry
I remember learning about German resistance too, but that was maybe in my German classes and not History
We then have the liberation part
The arrival of the USA and USSR and so on
We spend some times on the Normandy Landings
We have the discovery of concentration camps too
We spend a lot of time on Holocaust too
I think we have some infos about Soviet massacres too, or maybe it's in another course about the Soviet Union
Then it's the end of the war
We study the aftermath in France, how Nazis partisans are hunted, humiliated and judged
We then continue the history with the 4th and 5th Republic parts for a short time
Oh I think I forgot something
Général de Gaulle is good, Pétain is bad
Which is recalled a lot of times in the books
Man it seems so unreal
We study it for 3 or 4 month EVERY YEAR from secondary school to the end of high school
Same for WW1
I'm not exaggerating when I say we spend 6 month per year learning about WW1 and WWII
* King Saint Louis and crusades
* Richelieu
* Napoleon
* French Colonial Empire
* De Gaulle
because he’s not as badass as the others
In terms of poultry, French cuisine is rather varied
Chicken of course, but also quail, duck, goose, pigeon, guinea fowl and more rarely birds from hunting such as ortolans, woodcock or pheasant
It's quite out of fashion, but it was also quite common to eat the necks and legs of poultry, and still today traditional stuffings are made from poultry heart and liver
There is even a dish called  "le rôti sans pareil" or "the roast without equal" which consists of stuffing 17 birds into each other !
Ortolans are protected aren't they
last year, a bird protection group confronted an ortolan hunter who attacked them with a shovel, still in his briefs
Made national headlines
For those wondering, have you ever seen that vietnam style american dad episode ?
> There is even a dish called "le rôti sans pareil" or "the roast without equal" which consists of stuffing 17 birds into each other !
Don't forget to end by a stuffed olive or the taste will be ruined
Not super common, but it's still eat quite often
Not of the whole of french cuisine but it is definitely a staple of Gascon cuisine
I have two duck products on hand right now, two organic duck magrets in my freezer and one bag of pulled pork-style confit de canard
On the other hand I don’t have anything chicken related (except eggs, does that count) as I find it very bland
Last new year's meal
It depends where you live
People in south west of France would eat duck more regularly
Especially in areas as Gers or Landes
They mostly use duck or goose fat to cook
Foie gras, terrines, aiguillons and magret are fairly common dishes
I refer to this as litteral food porn
"Je lui mange le derrière"
It also depends of your family's income
Duck isn't cheap
Those that were bombed during WW2 and had to be rebuilt real quick in the 1950s. Thinking Brest & Toulon, for example
The only exception I can think of would be Saint-Malo, for some unknown reason the rebuilt buildings there are 100% ok
Plus the towns that were extended & changed a lot to attract tourists on the southern-eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the 1960s-1970s (same goes for some ski stations)
Yeah I’d definitely go with some city on the Côte d’Azur
Used to be small cute fishermen villages and now are large, glorified retirement homes
Saint-Étienne is famous for being ugly
It looks exotic I would like to visit
Je suis d’accord, mais surtout pour le port
La ville elle-même peut avoir un certain intérêt quand on aime l’architecture moderne (il parait qu’elle a une grande unité et que ce ne sont pas seulement des barres, ce genre de choses)
Après je n’y suis jamais allée, donc j’aurais du mal à en parler !
I was thinking of cities in Occitanie, rather
Those really were built out of nowhere for tourists and locals alike, whereas the Côte d’Azur has a history of tourism and the buildings that go with it (not everything was built in the 1960s-1970s there)
But hey, I’m from Marseille
I’m biased :)
La Grande Motte
Yes, I don’t know why this town is an exception among WW2-destroyed cities but I’m glad it is
-10 isn't that bad, honestly
It's cold, sure, but as long as you're dressed appropriately, it's fine
Although if you're used to greek temperatures, I guess it could be awful
C’est du béton presque partout
Le centre a été presque entièrement rasé pendant la guerre
Le Havre ? Oui, mais la seule personne que je connais qui y soit allée a bien aimé, comme quoi ce ne serait pas du béton moche (penser barres et grands ensembles façon La Rouvière à Marseille, ou Norilsk en Russie)
Donc bon, je ne suis pas sûre d’être convaincue mais, tant que je n’y suis pas allée, je ne me prononce pas
Do people mock you because of your accent ?
When I say accent I mean "district's accent".
I have a pretty  *S T R O N G*  German like accent (I'm alsacian) so some people be like "Hans get in the Panzerkampfwagen IV". I find it really funny because they can't say it correctly
I have a Breton accent and lived all my life in the south west of France
Other children mocking me was common in my childhood
But now it's very rare
I work as a French language teacher and I feel karma's at work when I hear some of my colleagues having to tone down their southern accent in order to being understood
I worked on toning down my accent years ago when I first left my home region and started getting comments from *everybody* on it, since I have one of the most recognizable and mocked accent of France (Marseille)
But whenever I slipped up, I would get smart remarks
I spent 2 years in Strasbourg, the only thing things I couldn't get used to about the alsatian accent were *vingT*, and the lack of un/in distinction
Lovely accent otherwise :p
Not a "regional" accent, I'm American, and after I speak a sentence or two, people who don't know me say "You have a little accent, are you British
" Which in the region where I live, isn't unreasonable
They think you are German because Scottish accent is somehow like the German accent
They both are "strong" accent
This is the only explanation that I can find
I know a French guy who learned English in Scotland
He has the best accent ever
It's like they eat the word that's hilarious
To be honest I never really noticed a strong accent from Brittany but then again most Bretons I'm friend with have been either born in the Paris region or lived there for most of their life
My only other contacts with Bretons is when we defend the Mont Saint-Michel from daily raids of bretons trying to steal it
is "how's your boot bitin' ?" used, or should i keep on pretending ?
Oh yeah I know that
My dad is from Wien and every time we travel to Germany, I'm the translator
But even with an accent not as strong as my father, Germans have some trouble to understand me x)
Ah, that sweet southern accent that I never seem to be able to understand (I'm from the East)
it is an unusual association, I can't imagine how it sounds
French people say Panzer generally
But when they want to imitate someone with a German accent (or a German) they *try* to say it in its entirely
Every time it's like they shallow the entire word
In Alsace we pronounce the T in huit
Why this word have so differents pronunciations ?
Keine Sorge, Er ist nicht ein Maller
I consider my accent pretty close to the "standard" French accent (media/journalism)
But it's super different from the southwestern accent
I'm not fluent in any matter
I can understand a little bit and talk a little bit that's all
Regional languages have been dying due to the French government forbidding their use in the beginning of 20th century
So it was my grandparents mother tongue, but my dad only understands it, and I, the third generation, can barely speak it
I was mentioning Breton as a geographical part of France, for OP to understand I had a different accent in French than others around me
Well, as I said, I don't find my accent particularly strong when you compare it with the "norm". But compared to the southwestern accent, it is pretty different, hence the mocking when I was a child
The first time I met him, we started speaking French, but as soon as he found out I spoke English, he switched, and his accent threw me
"Is he Scottish
" I thought
No, just such a wonderful accent
That it is I'll never forget when someone from Perpignan introduced themselves to me that accent is definitely something
Dear Dutch people from AskEurope, how do you feel about sea level rise projections, and the threat of seeing the Netherlands sinking into the sea
Joke aside, I live in Paris but my family lives in the center of France, in a region which was impacted by this summer's heatwave beyond belief
To give you an idea, the government launched restrictions on the use of water as the phreatic zones were drying out at light speed
So now I'm helping them to install a rain water tank, and we'll see if we can find ways to properly insulate the house
But TBH my guts tell me that this battle is already lost and they better move to Britanny for instance, before the next temperature rise transform the area into a desert
... you got me in a box here
In French, "Je m'excuse" instead of "Excusez moi". Literally "I excuse myself" instead of "Excuse me".
^(Yes, we are arrogant :))
Ça va / sa va (sa va is never correct, never ever
Stop writing that
Please)
Also people who mistake er and é at the end of verbs (like j'ai manger instead of j'ai mangé)
Drives me nuts
And the most infuriating one : *ça* (this) vs *sa* (his/her, as in "his/her house" for example) !
"Wrong" expressions that people say thinking they make them sound smart but since they are mistaken it just makes them sound stupid as hell just drive me crazy, worst offender:
* "Au jour d'aujourd'hui": "hui" by itself already means "on this (present) day" even though it's not used as a standalone word anymore, aujourd'hui therefore means "on the day of on this (present) day", "au jour d'aujourd'hui" therefore means "on the day of on the day of on this (present) day". STOP THIS MADNESS PEOPLE
Inverting the verb and the pronouns in a negative imperative sentence : *Aime-la pas*.
Explanation: in French, usually, any pronoun comes before the verb: *Tu l'aimes* / You love her
However, in an imperative sentence, they come after the verb: *Aime-la !* / Love her
Except if the sentence is negative, then the classical structure is used: *Ne l'aime pas !* / Don't (you) love her
Also ça/sa, ça is demonstrative while sa is the possessive
One that my sister says "ils croivent" instead of "ils croient", I hate it very much
Salut sa va ? /s
Also what native French speakers tend to miss is writing the “s” at the end of a word in plural
I guess it’s because it’s not pronounced, but it just drives me crazy
No, Pierre, there are two chairssssss not two chair
This sentence is not wrong, it is just redundant (it's a pleonasm)
I would argue that the one that needs to stop is "impacter": the fuck is this shit, honestly
A vast majority of native French people drop the "ne" in casual conversation
"ne pas" is mostly used in written French and formal conversation
It doesn't exist in French, it was created by copying the English "to impact", which is translated as "to have an impact on" (*avoir un impact sur*) or to affect (*affecter*)
Paying interns is mandatory if they work more than two months
Minimum is 3,75€/hour
That's 500~600€/month
If less than two month it's legal to not pay them
It is legally required in France
At least "official" internships, signed between a university and a  company
>Fair to say: I was a little bummed I could only get €200,- but the job itself is very nice, and I know most influential companies pay more (I intern at a small company with around 16 employees, my roommate who interns at a bigger firm got €500/month)
3,9/hour now, I'm becoming rich
To put things into persepective (because cost of life an salaries vary greatly within the EU), our minimum wage for a "real job" is at 10
25€/hr before taxes
I have to do an internship at a law firm (specialised in criminal law) this summer
I had to lie and pretend I would work for less than two months because otherwise they wouldn't take me as an intern
This type of arrangement is encouraged by our professors and our university
They basically told us to be grateful to have the opportunity to do an internship and to never ask to be paid (it's extremely difficult to find one because of the coronavirus)
Also an internship cannot be longer than 6 months and it has to be part of a school program
So that companies don't exploit young people
Only for internships exceeding 2 months
I had the choice to take an internship in my 3rd semester of master's degree for a semester, and it was mandatory for it to be unpaid + minimum 37 hours a week
I found it quite stupid as I wanted to do it in France (did a MA in relation to French culture), and I couldn't do it as internships over 2 months are paid there
And as I'm an international, I needed to work to get SU, so working + internship was like +50 hours a week, so I ended up taking random lessons instead, and almost none of the international students I know didn't do an internship for the same reason
6+ month internships in engineering are paying around 1500€/month in Paris
Companies often hope interns would join the company after degree so they pay them the triple of the legal minimum (still way below an entry job wage)
It's the bullshit 1-2 months internships that are either not paid or paid that low
I can't tell for the other fields however
Yup
There are some basic rules of what constitutes an internship
yes I heard that a lot for engineering but unfortunately it's no the case for many other fields
I'm doing an 5 months internship at a French embassy and I'm paid 3,9
yep, i did three months at 1200€/month and that was quite nice as a first year undergrad
On the other hand you don't pay 900€/month for 25m2 in a decent Tallinn suburb
I don't know how it balances out
Below two months is still legally an internship but good luck to be paid
And even then the mandatory paid internships beyond 2 months can still be legally paid waaaaaay below the minimal wage
Around 2400€/month after all taxes
If you live alone you will probably spend a third of it in rent however
That's like 5 cinema tickets more than the cost of a permanent parking spot downtown Paris
Got an extra room for me ?
as someone who lived there when I was a kid, I remember being a bit disappointed
I expected skyscrapers to be the glass and steel kind you would see in newer cities
I was still quite impressed by the size of some buildings once i lived inside
Sadly the quality of the construction was terrible
I remember quite well our super intendant (building super intendant are not something common in France at all) telling us we shouldn’t expect high water pressure cause we live in a 50 year old building
My childhood apartment in paris is 120 and has great pressure
I remember finding some off the pseudo hausmanian buildings quite funny
They looked hausmannian
but were 30 stories tall
I quite like the classic look of the typical NYC skyscraper, brown, small windows, and ornaments
Kinda like the san remo
I have vertigo when looking at high buildings from the ground, so I was feeling quite uneasy
Well, the NYC subway works and takes you quickly where you want to go, but it's dirty and ugly
The London tube is very clean, but parts of it are always shutdown (often for months if not years), and it drops you off a mile from your destination
The two need to learn from each other
Disney's Moana is called Vaiana in France and some other countries I think for copyright reasons
If you speak french, look up some québécois translations, I don't have any examples, but this is quitr funny
Despicable Me is translated as Moi, Moche et Méchant (I, ugly and mean)
Despicable Me: Me, ugly and evil ( Moi, moche et méchant)
We have the same weird translation for "Home Alone" ('Maman j'ai raté l'avion') and "Home Alone 2" was translated to "Mom I've missed the plane again" ('Maman j'ai encore raté l'avion')
In french it's "Nos étoiles contraires" wich means something like their stars are very differents froms the others ones normal people have
But it's a wordplay because in french "being born under a good star" ( or a bad one ) means you are lucky or not
Also it's another wordplay with the fact ( spoiler )>! despite they have the same bad star, the cancer, one of them will die and the other one live, so they both have a bad star but even so those stars are going each in their own different trajectory, hence the title
Pulp fiction is really funny in Québec
The translation's right but really weird to read lol (Fiction Pulpeuse)
I kept scrolling for Very Bad Trip, for some reason the sheer absurdity of that non translation makes me giggle every time
Its almost the same in french but it’s "Me, Ugly and Evil"
I have read this book years ago so I dont remember much about her situation in the end >!( except she is alive ) and I am not very familiar with cancers and if people can be cured or not, so I don't know if she went to a kind of normal life after or likely died shortly after Gus and the story
Twice, but it was in Argentina
I wasn't robbed but threatened
First time by a crackhead that threatened to put a bullet through my brain if I didn't give him everything I had, second by a 15y/o with a knife
The first one just walked away after a while (he didn't actually pull out a gun but he grabbed me by the collar while screaming that he wanted to kill me, so at this point I don't care if he had one or not, it was scary enough as it was), the second one ran away after the friend I was with strated to scream "Policía !" like a maniac
In my younger years I've been jumped and beaten twice in France during a concert and during a town party (a feria like Pamplona) but there is always alcohol involved so unfortunately this kind of shit happens
A guy stole my mp3 player like 12-13 years ago but that's all
Got my wallet stolen from a pool locker once
Got assaulted once as well after one of my friends drunkenly talked shit to a group of thugs (I obviously don’t hang out with this guy anymore)
Yep, I've always been very unlucky
Pickpocket, sexual harrassment, moral harrassment etc
But the worst is the surgeon who raped me when I was 7
Yes, my life sucks
Edit : [more context
Nope
Yet
My car was broken into once
They were nice enough to break the small window on the rear passenger door instead of the big one
Thanks for that, I guess
Assaulted by three kids who were mugging a quiet nerd type
Got punched in the mouth and beaten randomly in the street, they didn't event try to steal me something
Just for fun
Did you file a complaint/grievance against the students and professor
Is/was your grandfather a judge or carabinieri
I lived in Sicily for 2 years
One of my coworkers had gone to Palermo for a weekend
The police had the road closed, and there was smoke visible ahead of them
It was Giovanni Falcone's car which had been blown up
From France, I have two recommendation :
Fatal Bazooka : parodic french rap, from the early 2000's. "[Fous ta cagoule] (Put on your hoddie) is a must, while I also recommend "[Mauvaise fois nocturne] (nightly bad faith)
Ultra Vomit : parodic metal group
Most of the songs in their album "Panzer Surprise
" are also a must:  [Kammthaar] (parodying Rammstein), [Takoyaki] (after the Japanese dish), [Évier Métal] (french pun for "Heavy Metal", here meaning "Sink Metal")
I thought it was going to be our Benoît, tourne-toi, from your description
Exact same story
> here in Germany french rap is very popular among young people
Really ? Who would have thought ? Thanks for your comment, I've learned something new ! Also, I'm glad to know that you enjoyed some of my suggestions
Poland is called Childland
So how would you differentiate Vaterland and Heimat
I think i remember that Heimat is a kind of translation of home
It’s « la patrie », so basically it’s neutral because it’s balanced
Never thought of it as mother or father
Sometimes it’s called « la mère patrie » though, so
the mother father Lol
>‘Patrie’ is literally ‘fatherland’, so you can’t go around telling people that France refers to their home country as a female
We don't? Some even say "la mère patrie", looks quite feminine imo
That's just a normal window, the second type is especially everywhere
Not the most common but still not uncommon I would say
My father's house had them built in and he had this house built more than ten years ago
My home built in the early 90's have those
In France we originally called *vasistas* (same German origin) an opening inside a door or a window
([Like this] which explains why we would call it "what is this ?" as its purpose is to literally check "what/who is this".)
But today you can also call [this] (left side) *vasistas* in French, by extension
But it is more commonly called *velux*.
Yes, but it made its way into everyday language, like *Sopalin* for paper towel rolls, *Canadair* for water bombers, *Abribus* for bus stop shelters, *Mobylette* for mopeds and many others
Like you have *Hoover* for vacuum cleaners or *Kleenex* for paper tissues in English
(We use that last one too
> Abribus for bus stop shelter
Wait, Abribus is not the generic name
My life is upside down right now
Nope ! The french name is *aubette* but I have yet to hear someone call it that way, Abribus is JCDecaux's trademark ! :p
lol, it's like i'm asking you : do you have a channel in the US where you are rebuilding 1000 year old castle ?
&#x200B;
No pun intended ... but it's just how it feels like from our end
Karim Debbache is the GOAT
[Justine Leconte] although she happens to produce videos in English, and [Hugo Jacomet] (who does both French and English)
Virtually all the French-speaking content I come across is very mediocre and, worse than anything, spoken in very poor French (which I can't stand)
I kinda like joyca, he's funny
Le Rire Jaune are okay
Maxestla
"Le joueur du grenier"
A channel with content about video games, new and old
He also have another, "Le bazar du grenier" more up to date content
Another that i find fun sometimes:
They made a serie called "Noob" which tell the story of gamers in a MMORPG
ALT 236 is the one I enjoy the most, he makes videos about art and pop culture with a superb atmosphere and editing
Joueur du Grenier, a video game youtuber !
The [Joueur du grenier]
Lindy's a cunt
Matt Easton (Schola Gladatoria) is the superior Brit historical weaponry youtuber
a lot fo french speaking people of my generation (late 1990) discovered youtube with DiabloX9's videos
He is Swiss and was the biggest French speaking youtuber for a long time
Technically not a "YouTuber" though
What is he up to these days
Haven't seen him release anything in ages
I think he made it to trending accross the world recently
I discovered him a couple weeks ago
He's writing for the JDG
As much as I'm allowed to warrant people about him being insufferable at times for whoever's not a British supremacist
Every morning with colleagues and acquaintances
With very close friends I will often do the bise unless it’s unpractical (if I meet them in a crowded pub or something)
A solid handshake is important in France
If it's someone close, male or female, there may be a bise (kiss on the cheek)
I'm an American, and a friend had stopped by to visit, and when we were out for a beer, he called his wife
She asked to speak to me, and my friend says "Hold on, npt's kissing a dude
" When he hands me the phone, she says "Wow, kissing a guy, that's really open of you
We don't even shake hands anymore at work, just "Salut" or "Bonjour ca va". Among my friends though I think the handshake is gone forever
Always "la bise" or a hug unless specified so, in which case we go with informal shakes
Some non Muslim women like it that way too
Bise should never be imposed
My girlfriend is not Muslim and her colleagues know she prefers to shake and everyone is okey with that
Not much of a pets person at all, but if I have to choose, clearly cats
Don't think France has a preference as a whole
city dwellers tend to prefer cats and more rural and suburban people dogs, but that's a very broad generalization
Same goes for Europe as a whole I'd say
I am a huge dog person
And also according to statistics In France we prefer dogs but cats are close !
I love dogs but I am afraid of them
Used to have a golden retriever growing up but we were attacked by 2 boxers once while on a walk
We were close to home so we ran and the dogs followed us all the way to my garden
One caught him at the throat the other on his face
My dog bit off one of the other dog's eye but he survived
Since then I tense up around dogs, can't relax, don't want to get close
They can be super aggressive and people don't understand that
Just because they are nice to you it doesn't mean that their instincts won't kick off when a small ShiTzu starts barking
Just the other day I saw a sign at the entrance of a park
It was an altar for a small dog that had been killed by a German Shepherd
Don't be an asshole
Keep your dog on a leash
If you're at the park, put a muzzle on them
It's the rule but it's not enforced and I hate it
The park is for everyone
Alternatively, I can recommend the documentary Kedi, which is all about cats in Istanbul
In France we have many regional languages (some more used than others) : Breton, Corse, Provençal, Basque, Alsacien, Picard, Créole, Tahitian, Catalan and many more
France
Basque, Occitan and Catalan in the South plus Corsican (curiously close to Romanian)
Other regional languages in the North are Breton (two forms) close to Welsh, Flemish, Alsatian (close to Bavarian German), as well as a multitude of local dialects
In France, there is Breton
It's a celtic language spoken by 200,000 people today
In France we have a lot of "patois" (regional dialects) but we don't concider them languages
Litteraly every region has it's patois
But some are more developped and can be concidered languages such as Aslacien or Breton
I think it's important to distinguish language and dialect
A dialect is a variety of a particular group of the language's speakers
For instance, french people can only understand the french dialects such as:
&#x200B;
* Provençal, Picard, Gallo or Chti which are french dialect (patois);
On another hand,
* Corsican is an italian dialect;
* Alsacien is a german dialect;
* Catalan is a different language, but weirdly very similar to the french one;
* Basque is a completly different language (very interesting btw);
* Breton is different language, even though it's quite close to the welsh language
I don't know much about tahitian and Créole, but I'm pretty sure they're local dialects which are nearly  incomprehensible  for french people
Corsican is not a dialect but its own language too
It's close to italian but has specific phonèmes and constructions, so much so that an Italian wouldn't understand it
Créole is kinda like French and old African languages mixed
> Picard(chti is a synonym) isn't a dialect nor a patois it's its own sister language, the fact it is called patois comes from the francisation that made it look like it is inferior
I don't think a dialect is inferior to french language, I would have loved more diversity in our language
I quite understand you, I don't like when Parisians for instance call Breton "a patois" either
It's just so [different from french] it's definitly not a dialect from here
They make a confusion with gallo, a french dialect from the East of Brittany (my grandparents speak it)
Honestly, I never heard Picard, just the stereoptypes from "bienvenue chez les chtis" but I would not be surprised if it's a different language
Edit: I just checked some texts in [Picard] and I understand everything so yeah, it does sound like a dialect now
Do you know some versions of picard without francisation ?
AJA
Honestly, when I said "dialect", I was meaning "derived from". Considering this logic, I shoud have put Breton as a welsh dialect as well, since I heard welsh people can understand some Breton texts
The Celts from Wales and Cornwell who settled in Brittany arrived during the Vth century
They had privileged commercial relationships with the celtics countries, but that's all
Corsica on another hand was a Roman and then an Italian Region for so long (259 BC - 1768), it's not that weird to think their language derived from Italian and then is an Italian dialect
Well, the weirdest language in France is the Basque language btw
Still don't understand where it come from
Teleperformance is one of the world leaders if not the world leader in the call center field
The company was born in France but it is virtually unknown there
I worked for them in Portugal and they seem fairly big in that country
Schneider Electric , Air Liquide are the ones that come to my mind first
I've read about that company and everything I've seen was AWFUL
Fuck them
Lafarge (world #1 in cement and concrete before their merger with Holcim)
Saint Gobain (materials, founded in 1665 by Colbert, 170k employees)
CMA CGM (4th biggest container transportation company)
Vinci (world 2nd in concessions and construction)
Lactalis (world 1st in milk based products)
It's a french company and a really old one it was found in the 19th century, . They sell b2C but it's fairly recent , they only sold B2B for a really long time thus it's a pretty unknown company if you don't invest in stocks or work in their fields of expertise
I live in Paris now, and a car would actually be a hindrance
I go everything by bike, foot or subway
But I grew up in a village near a small town, where it would have been very hard to live without a car
My parents used to work in another town 50 kilometers away, and it would have been impossible for them
Getting a motor scooter when I was in high school meant a lot of freedom for me, because public transport was very rare and limited, and distances were impractical for a bike
Yup, everyday, not a fan of public transportation, not that there is any here anyway
Used to have a car and sent it to the scrapyard because I never used it
I’m 28, don’t have a driver’s licence nor do I need one
I live in a big city
My mom is 69, she doesn’t have a driver’s licence and has never needed one, despite living in a small town
You can go anywhere you want by taking the bus or train or any public transportation
So yeah, I really don’t plan on ever getting a car
I almost never used my car when living in a city (population > 100k), since public transport is usually good there
Now I live in a more rural place (still have small cities, but it's a lot more spread out), with lot less public transport, and it's a mountainous area so using a bike is not really a solution for everyone
I use my car daily, I don't like it but other solution is to climb 10km with my groceries
Planning on buying an electric bike to go to work though, but a cheap one is not enough for here so I need to think about it
From what I've heard, nonexistent
Depends on the area to be honest
In most big cities it's liveable but yeah, in rural areas you can forget it, you need a car
The Minister came out a few years ago to say that they would not bother repealing this law as it is obviously unconstitutional and is therefore not enforced:
Women are not allowed to "transvestite themselves", i.e wear trousers
You can't (technically) name your pig Napoleon
And also:
\- You are free to write a check on any paper
\- You own below and above
\- You can vote for a dead person (if death occurred just before voting)
\- etc
and we we can't name our pig Napoleon
Seriuosly
By law
A lot of people in Western Europe (including me before looking it up) think Balkan=former Yugoslavia
Balkans are the mountains, right ? Then there is a pretty clear [reason] to exclude the Turkish bit, isn't it ?
I suppose so indeed
Although every mountain ever near the sea necessarily has somewhat of a land before the sea, even a small one
It usually doesn't go from altitude 500+ meters to 0 abruptly
The area is so small I don't think it matters much though
Isn't it Balkans = the mountains with that name ?
That's like saying Alps = Switzerland and ignoring France, Italy and Austria
Ah okok
Grew up in Somme département of France which is infamous for the battle of the Somme
I know a couple of farmers who still find helmets or ordnance from both world wars
The geography is still very obviously damaged with various holes that have been made by artillery fire
[This one is well known and was actually caused by the British digging under a German trench and stacking 35 tonnes of explosives underneath
We even kept a network of original World War I trenches that you can visit
well, i live in a city build by romans, and civilisations where living there before
Because my dad in an archeologist, i can tell you that it's easy to find anything related to the past underground
Corpses, pottery, animals bones, fossils, weapons
You can also find the form of roman villas within actual aerial photos of fields
Many old buildings can be found in less than 4km
As well as the road network
Some roads are being used since the roman era
I live in France and my house is from the 1860's my friend's house is from the 1810's. Jt's quite common in this region bc they are big old farms
In front of my house there is a castle built around the 1000's and that was attacked during the 100 years war
There is multiple castles in that valley (the valley it self isn't very big) that also date back to the 1000's.
Right now I live in Clermont Ferrand and that's also a very old city, maybe a Gaulish settlement (maybe Vercingetorix) and then a Roman settlement that always was inhabited until nowadays
There is an old cathedral, that is often used as a meme
There is also an old wall to protect the city towers ect
So I'd say that if you dig in your garden you probably don't have much chance of finding something interesting, but it can happen
And if you live somewhere interesting you'll definitely find something
History is everywhere here
My parents house has been built around 1780, so even before the French revolution
I litteraly grew up in an evidence of my country's history haha :)
Also, the city I live in for my studies now (30 minuts away from my parents) is one of the most well preserved historical city through Europe
The construction of the cathedral, aka the neuralgic point of the city, started between 1000-1100 and got finished 400 years later, and was the highest building on earth for about 2 centuries
Right in front of this cathedral is a +600 year old building, pretty much as iconic as our majestic Notre-Dame cathedral
There's a traditional restaurant inside now
I can go to both of these buildings in 15 minuts by taking the tram to or 10 minuts if using my bike
I'll let expert try to find out what city I'm living in, it's a very known city and definitely a super well preserved city, plus it's history is insanely well documented
I love in a random town, I just have to look out of my window and I can already see centuries old buildings
So yeah, it's not uncommon
South west of France : the place is littered with old castles and things like that
Many villages still have parts of the old walls here and there
You also find some gallo-roman building but more sparse
We have a roman pool close from my parent's home for example
And a couple of friends live in a 1735 hospital (they rent half of it for almost nothing)
The next village is home to a pre-historic cave where people discovered some tools and things, hence why the prehistoric people are named like the village (Aurignacian)
So pretty dense, all of that is in a 10 kilometer diameter
It's uncomonly packed tho, most random rural areas wont be that packed
Same here when we go te the Atlantic beach
It's full of slowly sinking ancient german forts
That sums up world wars pretty well I would say
Crazy thing I got explained is that the soldiers manning the trenches totally could hear the enemy digging under them but they were not allowed to leave their post so they could only pray that they would be relieved before it blew up so the next guys would be blown up to bits instead of them
I really like to see things from wildly different eras which seems to be harder to find in the US aside from native ruins
Having access to thousands of years of human history without moving that much from my home is an amazing thing
There is so much of them that, blockhaus, the german word for bunker is iirc now in the french dictionary
When i was in primary school (2004-2009), we learn the country of the EU, we had to draw their flag once (i draw the Greek one)
Later-er, in middle school
In History and Geography class (we have both in the same in France, i know it's different for many country in the EU)
We learn their dates of entry, the différents treaties, and the borders of the EU
In High school
We didn't do the Eu much
Because it was already covered for me
But we had to learn the groups and objects of power within the EU
In Middle school and then High school we learn about it (I'm from 1991)
We learnt about EU again and again and again, everytime the same thing
I had indigestion about that
But to be honest I don't remember much
I remember we learnt about how it was form and when (and also what came before: the CECA with germany about coal, etc
) and we had to learn how it worked
We also had to learn with countries were part of it and the date they became members
I remember having to learn the list and dates in the right order and thinking "who care
knowing who were the first and then who is part is enough
". lol
It was a big part or our program and I probably hated it so much became we learnt about it to much and again and again etc
that's why I don't remember much
We don't know about the different EU political parties
99% of the poulation doesn't. I believe it's by willful design
Our politicians have too much to lose being exposed as powerless in the grand scheme of things
Same here
How long did it take you before knowing the difference between the EU Council, the European Council and the Council of Europe ? lol
common, (warning, one word in french)
For the Brevet, it wasn't that hard
I even play the nerd and said the capital of Malta, and Slovenia, to not fall into the easy one
I didn't used it yet but in some cities in France you can download an app, pay for tickets on it and it displays a QR code and a random number you can show to agents
Depend wich city, but here in Nantes I just use the smartphone app, no need for a card
With money, credit card, but most of people will take a Navigo card, it's a subscription that we usually take for years
There is price for every class in society, but it's not that expensive
Fun facts, because it's France and nothing really work, when each year people have to recharge the card, they do it late so there is big queue near train station, and the service doesn't work
(I had to wait 1h30 just for they told me I wasn't having the right paper to prove I was a student, they were only 5 people before me )
I pay 38€ each month with automatic account payment my transport card for région Ile-de-France
De either say cheese or "ouistiti" which means chimpanzee
Yes, but it's more a kids stuff now, most adults say nothing or cheese too
I still prefer ouistiti
It's sillier than cheese, everyone always cracks a little smile :)
I'd guess cheese was first just becomes it makes more sense: you'll notice most of those involve the sound "i" (e in English, but i in French and German among others) because your mouth forms something close to a smile when sounding that
Käse just makes you open your mouth vertically rather than horizontally, if that makes sense, which does not sound as conducive to good photos
Lol we say cheese
Not exactly a follow-up question but :
"You're French ? Great, I love Paris !"
"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ?"
I can't decide if people don't realize that it means "...wanna fuck
", or if they do and don't realize how gross and inappropriate that is
"French
honhon omelotte du fromagel
must be awesome to live in Paris, how it is
"I'm not from Paris and I would hate to live there"
"Oh

Here is my list and my favorite (ironic) awnser to it
Do you like frog legs
Sorry I only eat premium quality Kouign-Amann
Oh yeah I love Eiffel Tower
Ok, good for you
How much do you shower ?
Only when it's full moon, at 19:21, on Mondays and if it's a year with an odd number or if my mom die
Hon, hon I love Le France
Ja, Ja, Ich liebe Amerika (depends on country)
France is so sexy
I have a girlfriend (depends if it's an hot woman or not)
Catholic or Muslim
Satanist

*Speak Breton*
How are Covid policies on your country
Please don't
I have once been described as "English from France" by a guy in India
I have never felt so insulted in my entire life
The actual answer to that, I think, involves thinking about what makes the place you live in different from most other places, or at least from where your interlocutor is from
So what someone asking this wants to hear is probably something about the snow/climate, the super low pop density if you're not from the cities, the fabled nordic progressivism if they're american, but it also could whatever you, as an individual, think of your country
Ah, t'es belge une fouais
As a French woman, I'd rather be puzzled by it and gently amused at someone having vivid memories of a French class than be sexually propositioned by some rando (and most often than not, really ugly) tourist
Hey you're right that's actually how she is always referred to
Admittedly I have no idea what her real title is
> Flemish Dutch / Belgian Dutch and just Flemish do not mean the same thing
I mean I get this, but this isn't the sort of linguistic detail you'd expect a foreigner to know
In most cases (and in the NL), Flemish/Vlaams is shorthand for "the variety of Dutch which is spoken in Flanders". Also it would be super awkward to call it Vlaamse Nederlands I guess
Then again, not much more than français belge
Let's get fair with american, they also included in France's map Nice (cause funny name) and  burgundy (cause apparently it's the only place with vines)
And of course they know the Eiffel tower most, it's used in their" end of the world movie"s to show the entire word is ending faster than the USA (which have a retired or divorced scientist hero to save them but not us) by making it collapse with lots of drama
>(I dunno why we should laugh saying honhon
It is probably the least used sound to laugh)
When we say *une blague cochone* (erotic joke) or a 'racist' one we laugh with the hon sometimes
Being French I find these two solutions oddly hilarious
I wonder who is going to be the next french politician to face justice, so I know what to respond to
Fallait pas être belge aussi
Exactly
Just like Oriental or African countries have a yellow sky all the time and no green landscape
Nope the entire African continent is a big desert
If they did their research properly they would know the actual background music is the pan flute in the subway
Then again my own research is almost 10 years old, so maybe people playing music in the subway have moved on from pan flutes now
Ah, I was taught religion, politics and unions
From what I've seen (i live there) it's fairly often actually, thought perhaps because I mostly see vlaams in a context where it's being contrasted to "gewoon" Nederlands :p
Tu dis ça parce que t'es jaloux
Yeah they rarely qualify anything as "Belgische" now that i think of it
Even beer,which is usually vlaams or more often just speciaal
Not in my language
It didn't really mean east asia
In my language it means countries like Afganistan, the Emirate or lebanon
Thanks
I didn't know that
I'll be careful now
Here we call western asia the "moyen orient" and the word orient itself is not negative, even a bit positive because it reminds the wonders people who buy them in the past like spices, silk, diamonds etc
It's the same culture difference than with the word race : here it's outdated and taboo, just like "negro" would be
We learn that there is only one human race: homo sapiens while in the US the word meaning is closer to ethnicity
So talking about a race here would mean you consider him/her as an animal
Macron is very good at telling his audience what they need to hear to let a good impression but then it's just paroles, he will make it sounds as a constructive visit, giving hope to people, but then one week later in front of another audience he might say something completely opposite
All politics are doing it but Macron is really a master at it, you should never believe what he says
She looks so young for her age .
Singapore is pretty much at the top of every international ranking (except democracy)
Nothing new then, let's carry on
Good sign that he's a good manipulator

He's just good at that, playing pretend with foreigners
* Largest EEZ
* Most timezones
* Highest number of tourists per year (probably not for 2020 though)
* Highest percentage of electricity produced by nuclear plants
* Apparently, largest producer of duck meat
* Highest number of times the same emperor was exiled to an island
Highest producer of plums (actually the single region of Lorraine produces 80% of the world's plums)
Also the biggest depression rate
Algeria was in the UE (formerly EEC) from 1958 to 1962
Longest border with another country is brazil
History fun fact: the first liberated department in WW2 was
Algeria
Also the biggest French-speaking country is the Congo Democratic Republic with 85 millions inhabitants
Finally the French president is viceroy of Andorra
Canadians be laughing at you right now
Hasn't it also the longest lasting dynasty in the world
Australia you mean (:
Well, OP asked for "wow" facts
I found it hard to believe too when I found out
Well, the DRC has 85 million inhabitants and french is an official language but only 33 million of them are actually french speakers
Well I'm Lorrain so I can only talk for my region but yeah every cool teen drinks this at parties until they get drunk and it's fucking strong (can go up to 50° if you make it yourself)
Not really, but it exists
[It's the overseas territories]
Everything is relatively small
Take the universe as a scale
Not even
The only border between France and Australia is maritime so I don't know what you're referring to if not that
Google est ton ami :)
Il est le tien aussi, quand on veut faire le malin il vaut mieux commencer par s'assurer qu'on a raison
Je suppose que tu parles des vieilles "frontières" imaginaires en Antarctique qui ne sont reconnues par personne et ne sont absolument pas pertinentes dans ce contexte
No mate you can’t do that right before the season of tartiflette, aligot and raclette opens
That’s just fucked up
Turnips and rutabagas, yay :(
Maybe not as much as football but rugby can get pretty heated
No football really is the exception, and it always gets violent
I've never seen rugby fans go wild and it's the second sport here
It doesn't mean people don't care, just that they don't get involved as much
Yeah don't forget Quartararo :)
Fighting with Italy on who gets to cook what
We would be fighting with England to get the best seat at the table, throwing bread crumbs at each other
At some point we would get hit by a big loaf of bread by Germany who also wants our seats
We would then join our bread crumbs into an equally big loaf and shoot it at Germany
After consuming all the bread on the table, we would realise that there was enough room for everyone from the start, had we jus calmed down a little
Eventually we would all get drunk and hug each other
Unfortunately, England was too drunk and leaned backward on her chair a bit too much, got hurt and decided to leave the table
We complain about the food brought by the ithers
Except Italy
And especially Britain
Britain would be telling everyone to F off
Underrated comment there
We'd find it a bit weird as well ourselves though
Though we eat earlier than you do, we'd also find 7PM to be excessively early
Then France would argue that you already admitted the fries were french several month ago and that you should stop drinking too much beers ;)
France would try to flirt with all of the Nordic countries, by being loud and boasting random shit
The Nordics would exchange embarassed looks and try and ignore France, hoping they'd go away and leave them back to their silence
You get with your friends to have a fun evening and all, and then the UK sends you Wales and ask you to "take care of him"
He's retarded
Tsss, apéro first
We'll eat around 11 pm
Bonjour dear
How are you doing in this fine evening ?
Crossing the neighbour’s garden (Belgium)
Those are fighting words
Beside, people don't know what's good for them when it comes to food, you know this
#pineappleonpizza
France would step in and get involved : *"shut your trap England, everyone knows Belgium makes better beers than you !"* And then we'd fight, until we pass out, singing and hugging
No, that's way too early ! People are still at work !
So restaurants will be open for dinner at 16h ?
We have even afford local food anyway so we're all eating Chinese
At work or in transportation
I finish at 15h30 but I start early
Many of my colleagues leave around 18
That's interesting
Here it wouldn't be open this early
France's colonial history in North America is very much glossed over
But then again there's only so much history you can pack in 3 hours per week
The whole 19th century is something that I was not properly taught during my school days
The napoleon wars were briefly spoken about, same for the 1830 and 1848 revolutions, the 1870 war etc
but I don't remember the lessons at all
There was a huge part about the colonies though but it was a chapter that was going from the 19th century to the second half of the 20th
What I learned about the 19th century during my schooldays was mostly coming from the novels we had to read for French classes
Everything regarding Napoleon the Third was swept under the rug, and I find it oh so unfair
The guy ruled the country as a president for two years and then confiscated power to become the new French Emperor for 20 years, and yet school children barely know anything about him
He was a mediocre military chief but he had a hand in the Middle East (our close relationship with countries such as Lebanon starts here), he invaded and controlled what was Indochina and he participated in the Crimea war
He put Paris on a map again by having the first world Fair in the city, and modernised it thanks to Haussmann, a model that will inspire many cities around France
He also created a modern railway system as well as the telegraph
And yet all we remember about him is how he fell for the trap set by Bismarck
The Thirty Years War, and the whole reformation, are not taught
We just say "yeah habsburgs charles v (we don't even know who is he) François Ier and yeah 50 years later there was a massacre in paris and then there was the edict of nantes repelled later by louis xiv and he conquered stuff and then we helped the americans and we had a revolution k bye"
This is basically everything we are taught between 1492 and 1789
Interesting, I was taught about it when we spoke  about the Prussian war
You don't learn about the 100 years war
They got honoured this year by the mayor of Paris, who is herself of Spanish descent
The backstory behind the invasion of Algeria itself would catch the attention of a teenager classroom in my opinion, a pity they don't teach that
Some envoy of the French was presented in front of the Sultan (?) ruling Algiers, insulted him, was received with a gauntlet to the face, obviously
The French man got back to his ships and bombed the shit out of Algiers under that pretext
Oh I see
Sry for the mistake
A remake of the German series "Generation War " seen from the point of view of French youth would be very interesting
Of course the scenario would be different, but the idea would be the same
You don't remake a movie or TV show
Makes me think of americans that made an american version of Intouchables
It's ridiculous and ruins the original movie
[Adults in the room] is a bit like that, it show the negotiation during the  Greece's 2015 financial bailout with the EU,
It's full of contradictions and accommodations with history,  I agree (wehrmacht soldier having a friendship in the open with a jew in 1941, lol)
Nonetheless I found the project interesting, and would be curious to see it adapted to my national history, if the writers were bold enough to address the ugly side of it ( French SS, collaboration, arrests of jews by the French police and so on)
Dubbing sucks too, just use subtitles
No, you're already out
You're thinking of the transition period, that ends in a month
The French government has a list of opinions you're allowed to have
Any illegal opinion is punished with fines and jail time
That we're rude to tourists
We're assholes to everyone really
One of the dumbest things I have read about France and the French language was [this post on /r/explainlikeimfive]
> L'Académie française is a council which dictates the usage (including gender) of new words entering the French language
For example, when the iPhone was released they decided whether the word 'iPhone' was masculine or feminine
They wield such power that the release of the iPhone was delayed in France while they deliberated, even though "the iPhone" would be "l'iPhone" in French, whether it's masculine or feminine
They went with masculine, in case you're wondering
This is pure bullshit and it got 500+ upvotes
That its illegal to take and publish a photo of the Eiffel tower at night
Unless you're precisely selling photos of the eiffel tower, you're gonna be find
Countless videos on this topic, showing an overall lack of knowledge about french law are claiming its illegal
(For instance
Then it's just a game of circular citation
But its not illegal
In most cases you'd be fine
madeleine*
But yeah, people really don't differenciate between the USSR, its satellites and the much more independent communist states like Yugoslavia
This myth has been said about most western european countries though, it's not unique to France
To be fair, I'd trust the government over corporations to have access to security tapes
*anti-gay propaganda
Sounds healthy
Oh, the pharmaceutical industry is going alright in the US, not denying that
And yes, I'm sure you can get great treatment if you're rich, certainly
Some of these other claims I'm not so sure about, but none of them are relevant to the matter at hand, which is that "just don't pay, you'll worry about the consequences later" is not the result of a healthy system
Me not liking it is quite inconsequential
You (and a significant portion of your fellow citizens) defending it is the problem, but one that really only affects US citizens, so please do continue
The privilege of democratic societies is to make their own terrible decisions
Quite recently, Camille Kouchner, the daughter of Bernard Kouchner (founder of [MSF] ) published a book relating how her famous politologist stepdad Olivier Duhamel used to have incestuous relations with his stepson (Camille's brother)
The case take place in a very closed intellectual-bourgeois environnement in 80's Paris and unfolded a whole horror-story revelations
*Just transcribing what I understood from media, for more infos here is an [article] (in French)*
On that topic I’d go with D. Cohn Bendit
He will never outlive the memory of some of the things he told in interviews, among which is the famous sentence: "it’s fantastic when a young girl, a 5 year old, starts to undress you, because it’s something of an erotica-manic game
” He told that one on TV in 1982, so it’s well recorded, and he became a politician so of course it came in the news at some point & was a scandal
I'd give it to DSK rape in NY + link to "Dede la saumure" who is not only a pimp, but a pimp of the "underage" kind
Or the whole contaminated blood thing, which is totally bonkers
The stepson was still a child, and could therefore not give consent
I’m also surprised to see it called incest, especially since the abuser is the _step_father (of course there are awesome stepfathers out there, but do the children really see him as a paternal figure of sorts after the abuse
I somehow doubt it)
Yeah and it's about love fading away in a lasting relationship
It's very common in France
There are themed ones, general ones etc
There are usually all sorts of schemes for kids from less privileged backgrounds to go, like vouchers from the social services or from company unions
I once went to a paleontology-themed camp where only another kid and myself had parents paying for it out of pocket
Everyone else had parents working for the same company working with a selection of camps
It's pretty much my favourite place on Reddit, everyone is just super chill and informative
Best Ask sub ever !
In France I’d say once a year but now we can’t anymore do cleaning because of the covid
I hardly go, not because of the cost but because dentist are not trusted here
I last went 6 years ago
This was a new doctor because I had move in a new neighbourhood
Not only she was patronising but it seemed that she was trying to 'find' cavities (Dentists here have always suspected of 'finding' cavities that just don't exist)
I didn't go again
I always heard that you should go once every two years
I don't really have teeth issues, so last time I went was 3 years ago
I absolutely don't get what people would go several time a year if there is no health issues
> who are talking about “cleaning”, which is done by a dental assistant, not a dentist
Well not in France
It is the dentist that does it here generally
Maybe it depends on why you go
To do cleaning, my dentist said it should be once or twice a year (but again maybe it depends on people)
I usually don't go if I don't have issues
I learned about it during the chapter with the revolutions of 1848
The worst thing is we lerant about Poland partition, we are told about Stanislas Leszczynski (who was Louis XV's father-in-law), but but I've never heard of PLC in school
And the worst thing is that we don't learn anything about this war in France, even though we fought there (few soldiers, logistical support plus training I think)
History without Belgium ?
(Sorry couldn't resist)
Thats true if you have 1 salary for 3 people
If both parents work it's more than good
Damn how is the software dev market in Finland ?
I'm mostly a Java/JS dev with some knowledge (but no work exp) in React and Angular, 3 years of experience
What would typically be the wage for someone like me ? I hover around 2700€ before taxes where I live
I don't live in Paris, thankfully
It'd cost me about twice as much to live there
But thanks for the link
About 700k inhabitants in my city, but the avg wage in France is quite low anywhere else than Paris
The death penalty was abolished in August 1981 in France, under François Mitterrand, despite more than 60% of the population who wanted to keep it in place
The last person who was executed by Guillotine was in 1977
A minority of people today are in favor of a return to the death penalty, mainly people on the far-right
Better to have no death penalty than to run the risk of killing an innocent
That's not true, [a lot of people want it back]
The head would fall in a basket, although I imagine litres of spilled blood would have to be mopped, indeed
Gross
Still, I would choose the Guillotine over any kind of other method if I had to be sentenced to death
It's quick and painless (it was invented for that reason)
Problem is, by killing a murderer you create another one
So you can't keep up in terms of moral high ground : killing is bad but killing a murderer is good ?
Still a lot more than just the far right
Despite what a lot of french people, would say, France is pretty welcoming for immigrants, especially Paris, which is extremly multicultural
We are pretty welcoming if you try to adapt and we’ll be very happy to see you try to speak French
You’ll see many people answering you in English (even though you spoke French) just to help or even just for us to practice
We honestly like American people (but most don’t like the capitalistic culture of your country haha remember that Biden is pretty much right wing for us), and you’ll be even more accepted in cities
Integration is sometimes harder for some culture and some color of skins, sometimes
It’s sometimes harder to be black and/or Arab (darker skin) mostly when you are in the countryside and people vote in majority for Marine Le Pen
I don’t think that’s the majority and I think we are mainly welcoming (even more in the cities outside of Paris) !
No, but if I took the previous week off it would only count for 4 days instead of 5
That's not for everyone, depends on how your company counts business days I think
I don't really understand,  but I'm not going to complain
Works the same for other public holidays, I'm using that this week since next Saturday is also a holiday here
Not in France
unfortunately no, only the 1st is a day off :/
Nope
1st of May is a holiday and only the 1st of May
There are already 4 holidays in May here, so we don't really need more haha
also in France the 8th is a day off too, and it's on saturday too
And in france we have the 8th of May, so our loss too
I cross the border to bathe abroad, I never bathe in my country
Once a day, twice a day during the hotest moments of summer or when I was living on the ecuator
I shower twice a day, one cold shower to wake up and a warm shower to go to bed
I don't know how common it is but I think most French people only shower once a day
Daily, more than that when reaching heat peaks in the holidays but this is likely not that widespread
I shower everyday but take baths only once every two months
Usually once a day
Sometimes twice a day during summer
Less during covid if I'm not going out
Yep
I guess if you have a pizza cutter that's better, but scissors are more efficient than knives I find
I always used a large knife or occasionally a pizza cutter though I never owned one of those
One day I saw my sister cutting pizza with scissors and I was *appalled*. Honestly, it looked shocking to me
and then I tried it
100%a convert now
I used scissors in front of my dad, a professional chef, recently and you should have seen his reaction
He imploded and was so mad tha I desecrated both my meal and his kitchen scissors like that
I never saw anyone cutting pizza with scissors tbh
Shitty supermarket/chain pizza
I could, yes
Actual, respectable pizza
Never
HERESY ! Pizza deserves to be treated with respect !
I personally use scissors because scissors are versatile, while this inox sharp wheel is a bit limited in use beside cutting a pizza
So, one accesory less in my kitchen
I have no idea if my personal case is the norm in France though
Cutting a pizza with a pizza cutter is not that hard
Here's a [tutorial] on how to cut a pizza into ten err
eight slices
I prefer knives (and pizza cutters), but I’ve seen people use scissors
Not rare, but not the rule
Never seen it be used, I have a pizza cutter, otherwise a knife and fork will do
But if scissors are your weapon of choice I see no problem with it as long as it gets the job done
People from Alsace often joke and look down on my region, Lorraine, and people in Lorraine often joke about Alsace
It’s mostly for old bickering
Paris maybe
Every parisian joke about provinciaux (those who don't live in Paris) and provinciaux joke about parisians
In France, people shit on Paris
But really, you can call every single region trash and people will agree with you
Why ? Because most of the time it's either true or people don't know the region well enough to have an opinion
Also the departement Creuse is looked as one of the most rural places in France, and it's where half of my family comes from (and yeah it's rural af)
I'm from Normandy /Brittany (and there is also a lot of old bickering there, as between Brittany and Paris, or Brittany and every authority figure really)
But I think the regions which are the most laughed at are the 'Nord-Pas-de-Calais' and Marseille area, mostly because both have very distinctive regional accents so they are easy to imitate and parody
To be honest, French people in general love mocking others, whether they be French from other regions or foreigners
So it's more "what region of France do we not make fun of". And the answer is
none
Especially as a Parisian
I live in the middle of nowhere, which means that I joke on Parisians mostly, and people who live in even "shittier" place than where I live
Hans don’t start
I can’t stand Scouse or Brummie accents and sort of held that against the cities themselves
until I properly visited
Brum was great and I made a lot of friends but my biggest surprise was how beautiful Liverpool is
True "Parisians" (born and bred) are quite rare tbh, most Parisians are "banlieusards", that means actually from the Parisian suburbs or the Île-de-France region (10 million people live in the Parisian urban area, against 2 million in Paris proper), and a lot of Paris residents are not originally from the city
The Parisian urban area is huge
1 in 6 people in France come from Paris or its urban area
People from the Parisian suburbs mostly consider themselves to be Parisian and will mostly be considered Parisians outside of the Paris region
People from Paris proper however, regardless of whether they are actually from Paris or just moved there, are very perseverent on the fact that the Paris suburbs ("Paris extra-muros") are not really the city of Paris ("Paris intra-muros"), therefore according to them people from the suburbs are not real Parisians
So, it's a bit complicated because of the quite peculiar administrative and urbanistic situation of Paris, which, contrary to other big cities such as London or Berlin, has kept itself isolated from its suburbs
But let's just say that it doesn't really play a role whether you are actually from Paris or whether you have moved there
For outsiders you will be a Parisian
For people living in Paris proper, only people living within the actual city borders are Parisians, the others will be "banlieusards".
If you move to Paris, Provinciaux will immediately see you as a Parisian and will joke about it
But Parisian will not necessarily see you as a Parisian immediately
Same in the other way
Yes, many people in Germany tend to look down on Berlin
But, usually not because they are seen as arrogant or snobbish, actually quite on the contrary
The "petty bourgeois" mindset is quite widespread in Germany and many people see the capital as dirty, poor, dangerous and unorderly
They seem to have issues with completing public works on time (such as the airport), drugs and criminality, they are seen as a party destination for lazy youngsters from all around the world
I would say, actually those feelings do not differ too much from other Western European countries
Usually, people from outside their nation's capital tend to despise it
Only, in Germany it is quite a recent feeling
As Berlin has been (again) the nation's capital for 30 years only
Plus, it was a divided and occupied city and people didn't have it in high regards in West Germany before reunification (it was seen as a city for draft-dodgers, punks and other outsiders and dropouts)
Berlin is probably in the course of becoming a city on par with Paris, London or Madrid, but it will take some time
However, I don't think Germans will ever "love" their capital city
Just as people from France usually hate Paris and people from the UK usually hate London
You mean Paris
Lol, would you mind forwarding a link from a scene dubbed in German ? Not that I speak any German anyway but I'm curious about hearing "German Ch'ti".
Danke, very peculiar accent indeed !
Strangely no
Lollywood
There is the [”Cité du cinéma”] created by Luc Besson
It's quite new so it's not iconic yet, but it seems promising
It really isn't. The Festival is there because the Côte d'Azur is an attractive place to hold a festival, and the city invested a lot of money into it, but the industry is mostly based around Paris
The biggest French city is our capital Paris
It's a strange city as it's the most populated of the country, but it is rather small size wise
Which makes it one of the most dense city in the world
To compare with another European capital, let's take London, Paris has roughly 2
2 million citizen for a surface area of 105 Km² (10 540 hectares)
Which makes 20 000 citizen by square kilometre
London on the other hand has a population of 8
9 million citizen living in a city for a surface area of 1572 km² (157 200 hectares), which gives us a density of 5667 citizen by square kilometre
Now let's compare Paris to the 2nd biggest French city: Marseille
The phocean city is way bigger than Paris with a surface area of 240 Km², making it the 2nd larger French city behind Arles (758 Km²)
Now Marseille has 861 635 inhabitants
You really cannot imagine more different cities than Paris and Marseille
The size, the architecture, the people, the weather
It's just day and night
Interestingly, even though Marseille is way bigger than Paris, it's transport city is smaller and of less quality
Life there is a more Mediterranean one
People are more open too
The city is unfortunately known for its criminality issues
Which isn't really deserved
Marseille isn't worst than Paris or it suburb, but media talk about it more so in most people's mind Marseille = criminality and drug
The 3rs biggest French city is Lyon
Another completely different kind of city
Lyon is mostly famous for being the city of the Brothers Lumière, the inventors of cinema, as well as its gastronomy
One again its architecture is different from the last two
Which is refreshing
If Paris is known for la Seine, Lyon is being cross by two rivers: le Rhône and la Saône
It has a surface area of 47 Km² with 513 275 citizens
It's only a detail, but I really love its many bridges
As the city is being crossed by two rivers, a lot of different bridges with different architectures are spread around the city
Most are lighted during the night and they're all very beautiful and charming
I've had the chance to visit both those cities and live in two of them
They actually are my 3 favourite French cities I've been
I couldn't rank them
They all have their pros and cons
Paris is kinda cliché but I can't help it, I love it
I've been living in Parisian region for 3 years now since I study there, and it's just really great
You can find everything you want
Food, culture etc
Marseille will always have a special place in my heart
It's where we went in holidays when I was a child
Plus it's the south of France and it really is a different way of living compared to Northern France
I wouldn't recommend living in the city itself, bunch of great smaller towns around it, but going there during the weekend is always great
As for Lyon, it's the city closest to where I grew up, an hour ride
My sister lives there and most of my high school friends studiy there
It's the one I know the least, but damn do I love it
I'm in film school and I love its history with cinema
I love its vibe
It's not a northern city nor is it a southern one
It's a good in-between imo
It's the one I would recommend living intra-muros the most
It's also the birthplace of the French Tacos and every French perso that ever had the munchies after drinking too much owe Lyon their salvation
Sorry, I know it was long guys
I'll just end this by saying:
69 la trik
C'est pas la capitale, c'est Marseille bébé.
Paris, Paris, on t'encule
Edit: I'm stupid and shouldn't write anything after midnight
Edit 2: ok ok sorry everyone for comparing Paris and London
I apologise
I just knew that "officially" London was bigger and less dense and thought it'd be a nice insight of the French capital density and hence way of life
- Paris (2,2M *intra muros* - 12M including the suburbs)
Lots of tourists and full of arrogant people
Strangers love it, French people hate it
- Marseille (860k - 1,6M)
Relatively cool city, it's the complete opposite of Paris except for the suburbs
Both have high criminality rates
- Lyon (500k - 1,7M)
Nice city next to the Alps
It's more calm
You should use the urban area to compare London & Paris
Paris’ official city limits are very restricted compared to similar cities in other countries
Plus Lyon has the perfect situation to escape by car:
Want high mountain
Alps ski stations are at 3 h
Want small mountain country side with cute town
Auvergne is only 3 hours
Want provence style and mediteranean beaches
only 3
5 hours
Want Geneva
2hours
Want the Loire Chateaux: 4 hours
Want cute germanic style timbered houses
Colmar is at 4hours
Want a weekend in Italie
Turino at 3
5 hours
And by train Paris is only 2hours
If a French sang this we'll cheer
Unfortunately for you an albionnais has no right to insult our capital
Be happy that we tolerate your presence when we're in Deauville
Don't pousse le bouchon a little trop loin Maurice
Let say both are wonderful and Marseille suck
lol
For an afternoon yes, but for a weekend or 3 days trip, not that much
Damn I was close\^\^ thanks for the info
> and Marseille suck
Une cave
Une chaise
À poil
Don't worry, I've never been there but I was joking, I have nothing personally against it, accept that they are annoying when they say "we have the sun": it's not the most sunny place in france and I hate sun\^\^ 4 days of rain would had been perfect for me §
In France, 11 Vaccines are mandatory
Only some are optional, such as seasonal flu
It is mainly "reeeeee le gouvernement".
But it's also for the usual reasons:
- why do you want to inject something in my kid
- vaccines cause autism
- they contain mercury, mercury is toxic, checkmate
- a friend of a friend of a friend got the shot and now (s)he's sick
Read [this] if you want
To sum up :
* We generally tend not to like our government
* Servier, one of our main pharma companies, has been under fire for the last ten years
Some of their products have caused deaths, and they covered up the facts and lobbied the watchdog authority to stop them from pulling it off the shelves
Now that it's out in the open, trust in pharmaceutical companies has dropped sharply
* The (then-)government tried a PR stunt back in 2009 during an influenza pandemic, which backfired
Basically, we were first told that the epidemic was caused by a different strain of influenza (H1N1) against which the usual vaccine wasn't efficient, then, a few weeks later, we were told that our always super duper effective government conjured millions of H1N1-vaccines out of thin air
After buying these, they pushed much too hard to try to peddle them - basically airing melodramatic PSAs on TV all day long
I think most people - myself included - were really skeptical about their ability to develop a new vaccine in a handful of weeks, so while we weren't, before, scared of our good old measles vaccine, we became, then, anxious
We do ?
William the Conqueror is known here as Guillaume le Conquérant
But Prince William in France, is known as Prince William
Go figure
We write putin "poutine", otherwise the pronunciation would be very different :) .
Yes we do
The current pope is called François
Seems we've stopped translating, back in the days we would say l' Empereur Charles Quint (Emperor Charles V) or Louis II de Bavière, but the previous king of Spain is Juan Carlos and not Jean-Charles
Thanks for the tips
Guillaume, **le** bâtard de Normandie, please
We would have called him  Jean Charles d'Espagne, as we say Louis II de Baviere, so that might have narrowed it a bit, or le roi Jean Charles, which could also have helped, lol
It also spells it **Wilgelm** in some places, but maybe that's a declention of sort
As a South American, I absolutely loved the Balkans
I mean it's nice and all but I felt like I did pretty much all the nice places in a day
It was really nice but rather short
It's not stereotyped as bad at all
Lived there for six months after having basically no opinion on it
I loved it, it's in my top 3 cities easily
What are the common workplace tradition where you live
For example, in France, where food is allegedly a big thing, people bring the breakfast at work on a lot of occasions: every friday morning, when you get a promotion, when you retire, when a big thing happened in your life (marriage, first children), when you come back from a long period of illness,...
Oh, the coffee break is also a tradition in France
When I did my first work placement, they were a bit offended that I didn't took my coffee with all of them
In my current company, viennoiseries are technically forbidden due to COVID
Yet, the whole administrative crew allow themselves to have them every friday (there's even some beef between the first floor and the second floor because someone always store the break table (a small table) on the first floor due to COVID, yet the second floor table haven't moved and people are still eating and taking their coffee break there)
I  guess the reason why we have to bring things for our birthday is for 2 reasons:
I won't pay for Gégé's birthday, the dude has been an asshole for the whole year and works like half a man
I don't know Gégé's birthday anyway
Apply that to a company scale and you get the idea why you have to bring food for your birthday
Because nobody will complain to pay for you nor will have to remember your birthday
Oh, that's neet
The only few time I had beer at work was at a summer job where we could drink a beer during the lunch break, we also sometimes had a cooler with beers in it (but it wasn't allowed to drink on the job), and like three time in 2 month, our boss paid his round (IIRC, it was an agreement with the place's pub where they would do it for free)
Oh, it struck me that la bise is not twice everywhere
My GF's family is from Swizerlands and the surrounding of Lyon, they do la bise thrice and the first time I met them, it was an embarassing experience for all of us
But yeah, la bise is too damn long
at least, where I work, it's okay to just wave and say "salut" or "bonjour". Especially in COVID times
Well, sure he have, but all year round, you will have free pastries
That's a good for an evil if you ask me
How is that so pricey
Like, I can consider that in some asian countries, where there is a great demand and maybe a lack of bakers or of experience in the pain au chocolat field, you could have prices that high
But I would have thought that Swizerland have quite a lot of experience and bakers in the domain, as it's between France and Austria, and have its fair amount of pastries
Also, is the [suisse] a swiss pastry
Or is it just about branding
Because if that's swiss, I'd guess it might be cheaper than the pain au chocolat, and it's way better anyway
Wow
IDK if you're aware of the french cliché about the swiss which is that swiss people are slow
I always thought that it comes from the cliché Jura's accent which is just elongating the stressed syllable and lowering your voice (Donc ça sonne un peu comme çaaa)
But that wouldn't surprise me if that also comes from the way you greet each other aswell
But that seems indeed like a very long way of greeting each other indeed
The worst is that Lyon has the best number 69, he had the opportunity and didn't even take it
>How is that so pricey
It's Switzerland, everything is expensive
Yeah, I know, I went in Jura, I heard more people there talk with the allegedly swiss accent than when I went in swizerland
[Les Litanies de Satan - Rotting Christ]
The band is from Greece, but the song is in perfect French
The lyrics are taken from Charles Baudelaire's poem *Les Litanies de Satan
&#x200B;
[Dans Le Noir, Je Vois Rouge - Le Rouge et le Noir ; l'Opéra Rock]
Song from a French musical that is inspired by Stendhal's novel *The Red and The Black
&#x200B;
[Percées De Lumière - Alcest]
French band, pioneer of the blackgaze genre
Rock and metal are cool but have you listen some [french-celtic rap from the 90'] with bagpipe ?
In french alternative rock, influenced by guinguette (popular etablishment from the XIX and XX centiries) and Mediterranean music, i really enjoy [Les Negresses vertes]  (*the green niggers*, the name may triggers some people here but it is approved in France)
Of course it's french so there is an accordion
Charle VI the mad, literally suffered from schizophrenia and almost lost the Hundred Year War
Charles VI, "Le fol" (the fool), quite litteraly
Actually he probably suffered from epilleptic episodes due to inbreeding
His father almost ended the 100 years war by 1400 but Charles the 6th psychical weakness allowed the english to strike back by allying with Charles' wife and forcing him to give the throne to a english kid
Louis X the Hutin, who produced nothing but shit, and only whined and screamed all his life, without ever accomplishing anything
Okay, he died five days after he was born, but he could have made an effort
Charles VI almost made France lose the 100 years war because of his madness
Robespierre is a big contenders too
It's likely that England would have been Scottified by France had your kings won the war
Yeah i'd think of him first
I don't think Robespierre was mad
Even historians are pretty conflicted about Robespierre actual role in the Terror, while agreeing that he certainly had one
A lot of elements seem to point at him being the scapegoat of the worst culprits who blamed him for everything after the fact to make sure they did not get accused of anything themselves
Among the people who engineered the arrest and execution of Robespierre you find many people who were actually known for sure to have been on the field overseeing the worst of the Terror at a local level, most of the time in a very enthusiastic way
Robespierre was responsible for taking most of them out of the field by recalling them in Paris, probably in attempt to curb the bloody repressions that happened at a local level
It is very likely that the Terror was by and large the result of the actions of many men more than an actual system organized from the top
Robespierre was also a staunch abolitionist
Well that's absolutism 101
Same in French really
I'm guessing English forgot about the other definition of "terrible" which they had copied from us
[Affaire Dreyfus] is the most famous judicial saga France ever had
Almost 130 years later it is in every French history book when it comes to late XIXth century
> The scandal began in December 1894 when Captain Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of treason
Dreyfus was a 35-year-old Alsatian French artillery officer of Jewish descent
He was sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris, and was imprisoned in Devil's Island in French Guiana, where he spent nearly five years
> In 1896, evidence came to light—primarily through an investigation instigated by Georges Picquart, head of counter-espionage—which identified the real culprit as a French Army major named Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy
When high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after a trial lasting only two days
The Army laid additional charges against Dreyfus, based on forged documents
Subsequently, Émile Zola's open letter J'Accuse…!, stoked a growing movement of support for Dreyfus, putting pressure on the government to reopen the case
> In 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial
The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called "Dreyfusards"), such as Sarah Bernhardt, Anatole France, Henri Poincaré and Georges Clemenceau, and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as Édouard Drumont, the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole
The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was pardoned and released
In 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army
He served during the whole of World War I, ending his service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel
He died in 1935
> The affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France into pro-republican, anticlerical Dreyfusards and pro-Army, mostly Catholic "anti-Dreyfusards". It embittered French politics and encouraged radicalisation
Other famous judicial cases include :
- Trials of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette in 1791 and 1793
- Trial of Joan of Arc, national hero of the Hundred Years War and catholic saint, for witchcraft (or heresy, can't remember)
Though technically that would be an English  trial
- Trial of famed French novelist Gustave Flaubert in 1856 for writing an immoral novel about a cheating woman
The novel is often studied in school nowadays as a litterature classic
- Trial of Charlotte Corday in 1793 for the murder of Jean-Paul Marat, revolutionary figurehead during the Reign of Terror
- Trial of Pierre Calas, famous because it lead to the Treatise on Tolerance by famed philosopher Voltaire in 1763 about religious toleration and against religious fanaticism
The book is still a good sale 250 years later and a foundation stone for French secularism
- Trial of Giuseppe Fieschi for regicide attempt to draw France in a war against Italy in 1835
- Trial of François Ravaillac for successful regicide in a context of religious civil war in 1610
- Trial of Nicolas Fouquet, successful finance minister who tried to shine brighter than the Sun King in 1661
I would have expected that trial where you executed your king before it was cool and that one where you burnt a teenager girl for leading armies against you and overall kicking (your) ass
Since they're in your history books
Yeah and he was an absolute nobody back then, it was his first book
The trial gave him a massive advertising
Former president of the parliament defend an unknown author in a trial for indecent novel
What a headline
The book was hot fire
The carriage scene was straight hardcore porn for the time
The crime was outrage to public morality and religion
Flaubert was cleared
The same public prosecutor would later go after Beaudelaire for his poems, and this time won (he got around 3000€ fine and 6 poems were censured out of Fleurs du Mal to keep the publication)
I would have expected the Hundred Years War to be in the curriculum, I'm a bit disappointed
The build up over centuries and crusades is pretty interesting and the aftermath on your end was the War of the Roses :(
Fair enough
Since the title said famous in your country
I expected cases in history books to be more famous than cases in law textbooks
But both Charles I and Joan of Arc had a (parody of) trial
They weren't (too) summarily executed
So I counted it as trials every kid learned about at some point
It's just that those court cases have little interest as precedent nowadays and are more interesting to historians than lawyers
It was fuck long ago
Still would like to see a modern case with a lawyer going ballsy and using one of those however :D but it's never going to happen
Could be fun to imagine a legit but weird case where they would fit
I know that in Luxembourg you can visit a museum about banks
I know that Belgium has a lot of issues with their language conflicts, and that everybody allows forgets about their Germans
I know that Antwerp used to be the diamond capital of the world and still has one of the biggest commercial harbors of the world
I know that a lot of great Belgian francophones artists are thought to be French even by the French
(same for comics, la BD belge)
I know that the more north you go the more they love fried things in Benelux
I know that Dutch people are nice but very smug and somehow more scandinavian than germanic in their culture (imo)
I know that Dutch engineering and their dykes is absolutely amazing
I know that both are monarchies and that the Netherlands celebrate theirs with Orange Day
I know that the Netherlands has Friesland which is a region with its own language and cultural peculiarities
Quite a lot about wallonia and some things about the Netherlands and their history but not more
In french we can just say "merci".
But we also use a lot:
Merci à toi: "thank to you" when you are talking to one person, informal way
Merci à vous: "thank to you" when you are talking to one person, formal way or to several people, formal or informal way
If you want to make it clear that you are talking to everyone and not one person in a formal way you can say "merci à tous" or "merci à vous tous" => thank you all
They are a little bit more formal
They also allow the speaker to thank on the behalf of other people since it literally means "I thank you", hence you can change the subject to "nous" (we) if needed
Didn't know that
Expected UK, West Germany, Israel and a bunch of other countries to rank before
Another surprising fact, by the end of WW2, Canada had the 3rd biggest fleet in the world, essentially escort ships for the battle of the Atlantic
Fench, Italian and Japanese fleet got destroyed or captured for various reasons
Not books but authors that you'll certainly encounter if you're French : Hugo, Zola, Maupassant, Molière, Voltaire, Beaudelaire, La Fontaine, Shakespeare are the most studied I think
Also Rousseau, Camus, Stendhal, Apollinaire, Racine, Corneille, Rimbaud, Balzac, Flaubert, Dumas, Verne, Vian
Stories of the Middle Ages : Perceval or the Story of the Grail, Tristan and Iseult
And maybe some other foreigners' books like To Kill A Mockingbird, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Don Quixote, Divine Comedy, Pride and Prejudice, Oliver Twist, Anne Frank's Diary
Always the same few classical books from Voltaire, Rousseau, Zola, Camus, Molière, Maupassant
Almost never modern author (I had one in my entire scolarity), almost never exited one like Jules Vernes or Victor Hugo
Never or extremly rarely women (We only hear about George Sand but I had never study it)
For peosie: always Jean de la Fontaine in primary school (we had to learn one by hearth every week and tell it in front of all the group on friday) and later mostly Beaudelaire, a few other classical
Never foreign one
"La Princesse de Clèves" et "Le Rouge et le Noir" gave me nightmares
Can you list some Ukrainian classics please, I'm very interested
I never read La Princesse de Clèves, I quitted after 50 pages
I also disliked La Princesse de Montpensier, but at list it's short
Can't be worse than Madame Bovary
Having to read Madame Bovary is the most boring thing I've ever endured
Every page was a challenge
It's quite rare to read it entirely actually
Usually we study extracts
I remember studying the circles of hell
Also, we have some books who are mandatory but the teachers can choose for others, so maybe other French people didn't study it
It's because Proust style is very particular and quite hard to read, his speciality is "l'hyperhypotaxe" which means that his sentences are very, very, very long
Therefore, it's not really suitable to read or study in school, we may work on some important part of the book, but almost never on the entire story
Oh I also had to read that one
Guess my mind tried its best to delete it from my memory
Oh dear, thank you thank you thank you
The list is perfect, the illustrations are really something, and I so look forward to looking these up
And about poor villagers and serfdom
I've not read too much on it, but it seems like an intriguing subject now
Yes, I enjoyed it
I also did more researches about the book and Dante
If I have the time, I will buy it and read it entirely :) I'm also learning Italian at school so I would love to read it in Italian but it's gonna be difficult - -'
A funny one in French is Vasistas, comes from the german phrase "Wass ist dass ". It discribe a small window
Ersatz
Sorry, my german is a little rusty ! Yes it's "was ist das" "qu'est-ce que c'est". Wich itself could be transmated back in german as "was ist das was dies ist"
Ich habe Deutsch gelernt, aber alles vergessen !
Well, not super common but it trended again a few years back, because Zlatan, man buns, et all
Here's an [illustration] of what you also can expect
People are okay, except maybe for work environnements in which you're expected to comply, like trading
"Your Hair doesn't look german" had me giggling
I have also been told I don't look French on multiple occasions by people with very precise ideas about how French people should look like
I imagine it is even worse for Germans who don't fit the tall blonde stereotype prevalent in the Anglo-sphere
Thats definitly not the kind of long-hairstyle you will see most of time
> We’re no elves goddammit
I refuse to admit that
My experience too
Never felt people in Germany were "lighter" there than France
The UK, however, definitely fairer
Have not had the opportunity to visit Finland yet
*Mante* is the French word for mantis
The praying mantis is called *mante religieuse*, religious mantis (I think it is called "religious mantis" in all Romance languages)
Ah, I knew how it was called in Italian & Romanian and thought it was a Romance thing
Well, TIL, obrigado
You've been banned from the Romance languages gang
>No, because it's the literal translation of the scientific name
Ok but the scientific name is this because it looks like she's praying
Internationally, I'd say La vie en rose for "traditional" songs
For more recent stuff, probably anything by Daft Punk
Here in France, the following ones are really famous
Many have been translated into other languages and used by different political groups
1) [L'Internationale] , written in 1871 during the Paris Commune
2) [La Carmagnole] written during the French Revolution
3) [Le Chant des Partisans] written during the Second World War
4) [Le Chant du départ] written during the French Revolution
5) [Le Temps des cerises] written during the Paris Commune
6) [Verdun, on ne passe pas] written during the First World War
Nowadays, anything of :
David Guetta (Bad, Hey Mama, Titanium, She Wolf, Shot Me Down),
DJ Snake (Turn Down for What, Lean On, Taki Taki, Magenta Riddim)
and Daft Punk (Get Lucky, Harder Better Faster Stronger, One More Time)
For older stuff : "Aux Champs-Élysées" by Joe Dassin, "La vie en rose" by Edith Piaf
Take on me is Norwegian
Damn I love your country more now
I'd say rather "ich hab Stoff und Schaps" even though it's originally Dutch the German version is more known and I know that's not something the Germans are proud of
[Douce France too]
The post asked for song that aren't the national anthem
David Guetta is French too but he also took the American nationality
DJ Snake is French as well
Internationally I'm not so sure
Who's that
I didn’t know they were that famous in the US they are not that famous in France tbh
Even Daft Punk could be more famous in France ! Justice also
Really the guys from Justice can walk peacefully in Paris, I’ve seen them haha
One of my favorite pieces of "classical" music
The singer from Phoenix is friends with Daft Punk ! It’s a French alternative band
Actually they all started in the same band named Darlin’. And a British journalist said they sounded like some kind of daft punk and got some pretty bad reviews
So they ended Darlin’. Then they discovered electronic music by attending at raves and Thomas and Guy-Manuel from Daft Punk thought it would be a cool name for the electronic duo
Blocked in France, thanks Youtube (: anyway I've never heard about them so they may be big in their genre but they're probably not as big as Daft Punk, at least here
That’s kind of funny since justice doesn’t sound like the mainstream edm like Tomorrowland kind of things
Actually when they released “Dance” it was everywhere so that went almost “pop music” for a second (and it’s still pretty popular)
They are still pretty underground doing their own thing and it feels good like this
BUT they won a Grammy for their last live album so it’s not that underground
The style is underground but it’s so good I gets to the mainstream audience
Just like daft punk doing their own thing
It feels good to see artists getting real recognition by not following the mainstream recipe
Baguette hon hon omelette du fromage oui oui monsieur très joli le tour eiffel le fromage voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? (background accordion music)
It always surrenders
Honhonhon, le surrender, Honhonhon
Oh la la béret camembert mon ami
People actually say that
I feel you bro
Wow
I don't know if I'm more amazed, offended or entertained
C'est bon arrête
Not funny
Well shit man the only dutch guy I know is a crackhead
Women who slept with Germans were shaved in public, anyone who collaborated and was captured by resistance was generally given a bullet to the head or was hanged
Oooh, we have a very uncomfortable relationship with that part of our past
There was no blood bath after France was liberated, however many were beaten or killed and thousands of [women were shaved and publicly exposed] before a more fair system of justice courts was set up to give all those people (but mostly high ranking officers) some kind of a trial
Still, an estimated 9000 people were executed or killed before the some semblance of a justice system was set up
Many high ranking party however officers escaped their judgement or got really reduced sentences in the end because in the years after the war people wanted to "move on" and not dwell on those horrible years
Politics wanted to have France united again
The issue also was "how do we even set the limit between what actually was active or passive collaboration"?
I think the culmination of this internal debate was the trial of ex-Maréchal Pétain (leader of occupied France)
Pétain actively collaborated with Nazi Germany and helped to get countless French jews arrested and deported, but he was a WW1 hero and quite ill by the time of his trial
Initally he was supposed to be executed, however the court sentenced him to life in prison
He died imprisoned and senile in 1951
[There's a good article on the French Wikipedia about the whole process
Women had their head shaven and were shamed in the streets (shamed is a very loose term, sometimes these women were beaten, and even raped, in the most extreme cases)
Those that fought for the Germans (usually anti-communists) kept their mouth shut about it, it actually affected our society a lot because these men grew up very resentful of Germany and of the things they had seen and committed
As for government members, the main ones were put on trial, sometimes executed, sometimes prison for life, sometimes just locked up for a bit
Then, CDG especially, fought to get rid of collaborators who had made their way in the provisional government and later the government of the 4th republic
Some collaborators  even committed atrocities in Algeria, or against Algerians in France, before later being found of collaborating with the NAZI's and being put on trial
So, in government it was a long struggle to purge our offices of those that had commited treason against our country, while on the streets it was mostly women who were punished and shamed
Collaborators were condemned to death , and women who had sex with nazi soldiers or officers were shaved ( i'm talking about hair you pervert )
There were also proper trials, people sentenced to death, prison, etc
Especially Pétain, head of state who was imprisoned in a military fort till the end of his life
But
some of them got away with it and went on pursuing their career happily
*accused of
Quite a few accounts were settled in that way
Interesting, I didn't know about this part of your History
Like Louis-Ferdinand Céline
Yeah street justice was mainly for low level collaborators who got captured
High level collaborators generally had a trial
Like any occurrence of street justice there is that too
I forgot that in english hair means any hair on a body xD
Just the head , don't worry x')
Like préfet Papon
He was an insanely good politician if anything, not an ethical one, but genius manipulator nonetheless
And he kept his friendship with some infamous people such as Bousquet
People who voted for him because he was from the left couldn't believe he'd been awarded the francisque medal by Pétain
The shape "justice" takes for the rich and poor differ often differs
Low level collaborators were also only likely to be killed in the few months after the war due to Resistance Reprisals
It quickly stopped afterwards, since governmental pursuits of collaborators was quite light
Damn, I did Loches, Cheverny, Blois, Chambord, Amboise, Clos Lucé, Saumur, Chinon, Haut Koenigsbourg from the top of my head
Probably went to a few in the south west of France too
A lot
Castle are pretty common in Europe so I think most of us can't count
I didn't keep count
does it need to be a castle-castle (museum or still inhabited), or does the local housetown-building-castle count too
Only the one i live in, or when i visit a friend
I have absolutely no idea
I would hazard a guess around 50-100
My best friend had a castle in her back garden that was often used as a film set
Her mum was very proud of having served a cup of tea to Ewan McGregor
Even my university had a castle on campus
We’d wait until it snowed and then everybody would use those big IKEA bags to sled down the embankments
It’s so common that I kind of forget to view them with awe anymore
My least favourite is the very lovely Chirk Castle in Wales because I once locked myself in the dungeon there by accident and wasn’t discovered for a good couple of hours by which point I’d convinced myself I was going to die there
It’s really cool
I love that it’s pink too, it looks really unique
> Königsberg
I don't know if you joked or not, but [Haut-Kœnigsbourg] isn't Königsberg (Kaliningrad), it's in Alsace
[This one ?]
I know, but you are not talking about the same thing
/u/ItsACaragor talked about a castle in Alsace, in Eastern France, called the Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg
[Wiki article]
I work for a printing company that's also an office equipments store and art supplies store
I get 50% discount on everything (I draw and paint, so it's worth it), we also have a thirteenth month of salary, divided and paid in July and December
On Fridays, the company bosses buy food, usually barbecue stuff etc
lots of wine, and we all eat together, invite us all to restaurants for Christmas and gift us with gift checks things, that you can spend in lots of stores which I would count as a benefit
The sweet sweet thirteen month and prepaid vouchers for lunch
Health insurance, vouchers or reduced price for cinema/spa tickets, ski pass, stuff like that
Great offers for travel (400€ to go 5 days to New-York, hotel included, and meals for morning and evening for example)
We also have some events done by the company which are free
And we have some partnerships to have vegetable baskets, bio food, things like that
There is also a compensation for meals and home-work transit but I think it's in the French law anyway
I work for the state so obviously I get nothing
I know well how the tax administration works which is very handy when it comes to my personal taxes but that’s about all
Health insurance
I mean, they take some money from my monthly pay, but that insurance + social security entirely cover my regular monthly trips to the endocrinologist, occasional generalist visits, dentist, medical imaging, other specialists, and prescription drugs at the pharmacy
Oiseau would be it I think, a very common word actually, since it simply means "bird". Now if you add y, things get more complicated
I don't get it
I get that it's a reference to The Room, but what's the link, ELI5 please
Hell yeah
Drunk singing is one of those things that make life more enjoyable !
Africans speakers are easy to understand, until they start to drops Swahili or specific linguo words
Quebec accent can be hard to get and then they have a different set of anglicism and confusing vocabulary variations (*voiture* vs
*char*)
Yep, just like your post :)
Honestly, even though it can be tough sometimes, in the end, it's quite easy
Africans speaking French sure have one hell of an accent (and very diverse from region to region), but once you get used to it, the vocabulary is more or less the same
but the accent
Canadian french is fine, you just need 20 minutes of adaptation for the accent and then you can understand virtually everything beside their slangs
I'm not fluent in spanish and portuguese but I'm like a strong B2 I guess
For spanish, I think Mexican spanish is super fucking easy to understand, they speak slow and nice
Chileans speak like they have a train to catch in 5 seconds and they need to hurry the fuck up to finish their sentence, which makes their spanish difficult to understannd for me
I learnt Brazilian portuguese and I still struggle a lot with European portuguese, the phonology is completely different
Brazilian sounds weirdly more like spanish and European portuguese where it feels like they mumble throught words
Apparently portuguese people don't have any issue understanding brazilians
Still easier to understand a dude from Central Africa speaking french than someone from the suburbs of Lens
Quebec does use a lot of anglicisms too, but they are different from the ones used in France
Of course you speak baguette, but you have a weird accent, that's all
All poles speak baguette with a mushroom, tomato sauce and cheese accent
TIL
Un anglois qui parle français
On a finalement réussi ? On vous a vaincu ? Après Jeanne d'Arc, Azincourt, Trafalgar, Waterloo, Fachoda, on tient enfin notre revanche ? :)
Les anglais ne nous ont jamais officiellement vaincu et chassé de leurs terres après l'invasion de 1066
L'Angleterre c'est la France
Ich auch
Boring answer but you can't get much more "defining event" than the french revolution
The French Resistance
Behind every political choice and about what we choose to define ourselves as French is the line between Vichy and la France Libre
The speech André Malraux gave during the transfer of Jean Moulin's ashes to the Panthéon is to this day the most enthralling and emotionally shaking speech EVER pronounced and recorded in our history
It only compares to Martin Luther King's speech "I have a dream".
People being beheaded, mass protests, politics are messy and everyone hates everyone, Age of Enlightment, very cool flag, very cool symbols (Marianne, cocarde, bonnet phrygien)
I’d argue that WW2 was as defining as the Revolution
It shaped our current politics (change of republics, of political parties, of influences among them
the far right is no longer made out of monarchists, for example: it’s made out of fascists)
(This is a very simplified vision of things, as there are still French monarchists, and the French right is kind of in a crisis, but it gets the point across
I just meant the entirety of it and its impact, I wasn't talking about Napoleon or the Napoleonic wars that followed, though they had a huge impact as well
That's still part of the Revolution
It was quite long
I don't think people believed the accusation of incest
In fact, it was so obviously false they put it aside and it wasn't mentionned in the final charges and sentence
They just wanted MA to be executed
She defended herself so well that the audience was becoming more and more hesitant (a part was thinking Hébert went too far with that accusation, especially the mothers who could relate more with MA), but the jury was composed of corrupted radicals republicans
It was just a rigged trial, the goal was to execute MA, no matter how she behaved
The public accuser, Fouquier-Tinville (whose surname was "The supplier of the guillotine", to give you an idea of the man), was an opportunist and was famous for his lack of mercy, and required and obtained the execution of more than 2000 people (and like quite a lot of important people of that time, he was himself guillotined after the Terror)
He basically fabricated false proofs, false witnesses, etc (we _did_ find proofs that she was giving informations to her family in Austria so she _was_ guilty of treason, but it was long after the trial so she shouldn't have been executed at that time)
MA had no chance from the start
She kind of knew it, knowing who was in charge, but at the same time, she still defended herself as much as she could
Was she completly guilty ? It's hard to judge from our time, but it's certain that she didn't have a fair trial at all
It was just to keep up appearences of a republic where all citizens are equal and have the right of a trial, and to satisfy the population who hated her (she was I think the most hated queen in French history, even before the French revolution, with maybe C. De Medicis)
Yes, her son Louis died in prison from illiness (caused by severe abuse)
He was beated, sexually assaulted and endoctrinated into hating the monarchy and his own family for two years
He was ten years old when he died
Truly horrific
All of the family members died on the guillotine apart from Louis XVI's brother who escaped in Belgium just in time (and then became the king Louis XVIII after the fall of Napoleon), and one of Louis XVI's daughters, Madame Royale, who lived a long life and never fully recovered from the events and her trauma (which is quite understandable)
Not fun fact : the two lawyers of MA, Chauveau-Lagarde and Tronsson (who were very famous btw because they defended a lot of famous revolutionnaries like Charlotte Corday, Bailly) were summoned just after the trial and had to justify themselves because they were defending MA "too much" for the General Safety Committee
They were both skilled and upright, and did as much as they could to save her, because it was their job, despite the pressure from the Committee
Both were arrested during the Terror and narrowly escaped the guillotine
I have never ever heard of her being accused of incest
It's less known but there was the same kind of stuff toward Louis XV
His rule is famous for the fight between the absolute monarchy and the regional parliaments with the latter saying the law has biggest power than the king and people serving the law are somehow independnt from the king
So there was a famous strikeback from the monarchy with Louis XV coming to the Parliament of Paris and recalling everyone who's in charge ( in a badass speech "discours de la flagellation" ) where he say that people of law are his royal officers and making justice is the duty of the king, peace within the kingdom is the most sacred duty of the king, there cannot be a rival power to the king within the monarchy etc etc and his minister Maupeou bannished the Parliaments, makes the justice free and remplace all the former people of law by royal officers
Of course the bourgeoisie wich was the main social category working as people of law is upset and start spreading rumors and especially one : Louis XV is handsome despite being in his 50, that's because he takes bath filled with blood of virgin girls abducted to Versailles and others stuff like that
>Yes, her son Louis died in prison from illiness (caused by severe abuse)
He was beated, sexually assaulted and endoctrinated into hating the monarchy and his own family for two years
He was ten years old when he died
Truly horrific
That's not true and is at best some shady royalist propaganda
Louis XVII was severely mistreated, but by neglect
There is no evidence of him being beaten, even less so sexually assaulted
Antoine Simon, the only real caretaker before Louis sickness, cared very little about educating or indoctrinate the child either (because he was not paid nearly enough to care) and Louis had to be coerced into testifying against his mother
The kid did not deserve his fate, but there is no need to darken the story
So what is your point ?
Most of it honestly as I'm not very fond of food, but snails is the first one that came to my mind
Oysters at Christmas and New Year's dinners
And not food, but I can't stand the smell and taste of alcohol
Le boudin blanc, and le boudin noir
They are disgusting
I could not stand then as child and I cannot stand them now
In London, where stuff is expensive, it's actually good value for food brought to your table
Of course I need a whole chicken to be satisfied, but it's the cheapest reasonably healthy food you can get at a central London restaurant
That's because Germans don't know how to make it
Come over to France and have a choucroute, you'll see what you're missing
Snails aren't popular
Not a lot of people I know ever tried snails
That's such a cliche
I know right, I don't deserve this title
I mean I remember the big christmas dinners with the entire family and pretty much everyone would eat snails bar kids, and me
For me it's every Christmas, and you see a lot of them in supermarkets in December
It's rare in restaurants though, except in some specific regions
Frogs however are basically non-existant, and few French people have even tasted them (I haven't )
No because I'm fine as I am right now, don't care about food nor do I want to
It could become kind of annoying if I ever travel to another country, like I'd need to take my own food with me or some shit, I'll see when that happens
Omg for real
We never had snails for Christmas
Oysters are a thing though, and I hate it
Cliché but mostly because they are expensive
If they weren't I think they'd be a more common dish
Definitely a cliché. I've never seen frog's legs in a restaurant or at a table
The only person I know who tried them once is my father and he hates them
Snails, OTOH, are uncommon but not rare
A minority of people really like them
If there's someone who likes snails in a family, they're at the Christmas table
Snails are easily available and about 10% of restaurants would have them on the menu, but frog's legs I've seen on a menu maybe twice in my life
I'm from Burgundy so that's probably why we have so much snails
In my family the kids got snails, the grown ups got foie gras
Hundreds and hundreds of snails
Yum
Haha they kept all the foie gras for themselves that's sad
Well, they’d occasionally send a cousin (older kid) to give us some, but he’d eat it all himself between the two tables
"La bise" - basically giving everyone 2 (or more, usually up to 6) kisses on the cheek everytime you greet them and again when you're about to leave them
Also has to be done with total strangers, if being introduced in a casual context
To this day, the only known technique to escape it is to pretend being sick
>usually up to 6
Hahaha, what is this madness
I thought 4 was the max
4 is already too much
who does 6
You can also just say that you prefer to shake hands with everyone
My girlfriend did that when she started working there and people just went "alright, then" and no one had any problem with that
You also don't actually kiss, it's more getting your cheek close to the other person's cheek and doing the noise
Actually kissing a coworker on the cheek would be very awkward unless you are mutually into each other and trying to make it clear
It's alright if it is done against the party you don't like
That's how people in a lot of countries think anyway
Well since both are kissing each other's cheek at the same time, you can't be perpendicular to the cheek and give a proper kiss
So it's more like the cheeks are parallel and the lips half touch it I'd say ? ... I would make a drawing but it would be an even poorer explanation, Entschuldigung
That first kiss on the cheek, that's a big oof if I know one
You are not supposed to touch the other's person skin with your mouth at all
It would be extremely weird if I felt a coworker actually coming close to kissing me on the cheek
Because it doesn’t mean anything, it’s a very specific category linked to the US
It’s social
If you are open to advices, feel free to drink when you can but if you do always do so at your own rythm
Don't accept any form of pressure to drink more than you want or faster
That will save you a lot of headaches over the years
You generally kiss people everyday in France
It's just the way we greet
That's another option
Oh what are they
Haha very cool
Obviously Le Louvre is great, but le Musée d'Orsay is absolutely splendid too
My favourite Paris' museum certainly is le Musée National des Arts Asiatiques (national museum of Asian art), or more simply called Musée Guimet
It's just absolutely magnificent
Otherwise le musée de la mignature et du cinéma (museum of mignature and cinema) in Lyon is absolutely breath taking if you're a cinephile
It full of film sets and props
There even is the triceratops from the first Juracic Park and the Alien queen from Aliens
A must see if you're in Lyon
Rijksmuseum, definitely, even if only for Rembrant's The Night Watch
It was eerily haunting and I stayed there for ages looking at it (also massively bigger than I thought it would be
Warsaw Uprising Museum is definitively the museum to do in Warsaw for any foreigners (at least for frenchmen)
90% of frenchmen never heard about Warsaw Uprising (I guess it is the same for most western and southern europeans) and few people confuse warsaw uprising and warsaw ghetto Uprising
Personnaly I knew about Warsaw Uprising before, but I learnt things visiting It
>	Rome: Musei Vaticani
But
It is not from your country
Yeah the impressionidt gallery is my favourite
And just the setting in itself
A former train station now turned into a wonderful museum
They exist and are known, but are not as common as McDonald's (the most common chain) or even Burger King or Subway
I only ate there once and it was very good, sadly I've never had one close to the places I've lived
Their official website says there over 250 restaurants in France for now and they plan to double that number in the next 10 years
Not as common as McDonald's but you'd expect I every bigger city
My city has 3 KFC's and only is the 8th biggest town of France, so you'd find more or less everywhere
Apparently we have 262 but I've never seen one in my life
Just a fun fact, they're called PFK in Québec which is a litteral translation of the brand's name to respect the law
It's pretty prevalent
I think you have one at least in every middle-big cities but in big cities  you usually have more than one
IT's not as prevalent as mcdonald tho and it has only been a decade since it started to get popular I guess
I mean, the first time I saw a KFC was around 2009 and I thought it was a regional "americanized fast food" kind of thing
I think the second time I saw one was in 2012-2013
Yes, France is the second consumer of anime -Japan being the first
That data is correct
All of those seem credible to me
Some would think Italians are first by far for pizza, but you guys prefer quality over quantity
It's seen as a basic adult skill, at least for the basic meals, the more traditional meals are more family recipes and things you improve on over the years
I grew up in a third world country
Very often the range of ingredients was limited to seasonal produce and some things were just no available all the time
My cooking has always been having an idea of type of dish - stew, soup, pasta, dumplings, pie
- and using the ingredients I have at hand
I honestly feel it's more fun to cook like this
On the other hand I'm not very good at following recipes lol
Netherlands, even if we do have a border
United Kingdom
You guys are getting neighbours ?
Well the Uk, but also Ireland
There's not much sea between us
The Netherlands, if you don't count overseas territories
There's a border between French and Dutch speakers that runs through France and Belgium, but no direct border to the Netherlands
England if you don't count the tunnel
England obviously because we are very close and historically we have always been related
Did you mean: Man is lonely
Soon
he made a joke with the name of his island
Armenia, Moldavia and probably a couple of stans
Yes you're right
Isn't this one more one way though
I was making a joke as well :(
Monaco, the only country that matters
We bullied everyone
We're the best country in the world, so everyone's jealous
And they all say we think we're superior
I don't know why they say that
I don't.
I think we're too similar
Good food, good booze, fashion, etc
And Euro 2000, WC2006
I understood some of what you guys were saying but it sounds like you guys were having fun
It's "les différentes", but other than that, that's pretty good ! Miles better than my italian (I also never studied Italian)
Can't blame you, French is weird as shit
We do love our silent letters, but it's feel really weird without them
Je veu dire, ça a quan même l'air sacrémen stupid comme ça, tu ne trouve pa ?
There is a lot of soldiers and officers with rifles patrolling in Paris wich you would not see in others cities aside Marseille maybe
Housing is expensive af it's a joke
Public transportation is fine but dirty
Everything cost much than in others regions, even a simple coffee
Cultural and social life are very good
You have the best schools of the country ( but good luck to house not so far from them )
There is a lot of remnants from ancient eras wich is cool
There is a lot of tourists everywhere ( not true since the outbreak tho )
Sometimes you can encounter the republican guard moving with horses between their barracks wich is cool too
It's really not the same
Some French even say Paris is not France
For having lived in Kraków for a year and remember it being a very, very important city in Polish history, I've always wondered how important is it in the news
Is the city a major one in the Polish economy/politics being the second largest
That's very interesting and it reminds me of how much Paris is mentioned in our news compared to the other main cities though they always tell that the area they talk about is in Paris
However Marseille and Lyon (2nd and 3rd city) are mentioned fairly often
Yep
People act different, think different, and we dont really understand eachother
Decisions for all the country are mostly made in Paris, so thats actually a problem
The occitan, auvergnat (or else) Guy doesnt give a .... about Paris people problems
A lot of us don't trully mind, at least my friends and I don't.
We kinda got used to it
Not only that, but also because the area known as Germany developed with many different princedoms, city states etc which gave it a couple of big cities
Berlin was picked as the capital because it was the capital of Prussia since it was Brandenburg
Thus it never got as centralized and important to the country as Paris and London were to France and Egland
Another example with other cities as big/important as the capital due to history could be Italy, with Milan, Torino, Naples
I'm occitan and cévenol, so yeah I'm totally in this, Paris and Parisians feel like another planet for us
I still don't like it, and never will
As a whole they give ppl a sense of security, it's at least the reason I heard when the gov decided to renew their presence a few years ago even tho they don't really do much against terrorism
No, not in France, but at some point there was a trend to give scratch cards (they were selling cards as a set of 5 in a pretty gift envelope) as a small present

I am from France
My best memorie
It was when I was a little kid
Less than 10 years old
With my father, my stepmother and my brother, we went to Italia because we were in holydays in Antibe which is relatively close
We came by mountain roads
It was odd to hear the Italian radio
But satisfying
We arrived in a pretty town, in front of the sea
We ate at a restaurant and it started
There was a sidewalk with some small posts
I ran on this sidewalk and a fell down
If I would have done nothing, the post should have been right in a very sensitive part of my body, between my legs (I am a guy) but I rotated and I landed, with all my strenght, on my elbow
I was crying and crying
And Here it was beautiful
Italian people came to me to reconfort me ! An old man came out of his house and gave me  a grape
He was an ancient football player of a famous Italian club
This is my best memorie from another country
In france, if I would fall down in the street, nobody would care
But in Italia, a foreign country with nobody I knew, people were helping me
I said "grazzi mile" a lot of time
It was awesome
> I point at my watch and say "but there is still ten minutes left". He looks me dead in the eyes and says "no", keeps staring at me for a second or two and then just walks away
You got the real French experience here honestly
Hahhaha yup
French people take their lunch brakes very seriously
The France thing is frequent, it's also true for shops or supermarkets, if you enter in the last minutes you'd better hurry
> France: a hidden beach in sardinia
Never saw such a great water
Hmmm, I don't believe we colonised Sardinia yet
Paul Carbone and then Antoine Guerini, Corsican leaders of the French connection which was estimated to be responsible for 80% of the heroin circulating in the US in 1970 thanks to a collaboration with Lucky Luciano in the US
The French connection soured relationships between France and the US at some point as France was accused of not trying hard enough
Then French and US police collaborated more and succeeded in stopping the connection
Don't you guys had some Ecstasy Lord
There’s an Arte reportage about guerini I believe -or was it about the Corsican mafia in WW2
It was interesting
There is a nice 70s movie by William Friedkin about this story
Yeah until the end of the Battle of France the use of Pervitin was widespread in German armies, up to 833,000 tablets per day were produced in the Reich and the Wermacht received 35 millions tablets between April and July 1940
It's more than just the shock troops that were given a little boost but a whole front fueled with drugs
Amid medical concerns, already known and voiced by Leonardo Conti before the war but ignored, the use of Pervitin was cut and already limited by the the end of 1940
At the start of the Russian campaign drugs were already scarce and some kept for "emergency", but nothing compared to the extent of what was used in Poland and France
Thanks that interesting to know
The account I read talked about emergency without much details (hence why I put it between quotes), I didn't know if it was for some offensive or given to units during long march
Giving it as a reward kinda make sense
There are a few lmao
Brittany and the Pays Basque have a strong national identity but i don't think they would actually secede
The part most likely to secede is Corsica imo
They're great with tourism but they are apparently not welcoming at all to mainlanders who want to settle there
Probably some oversea territory
The strong nationalist identities are the Pays Basque, Corsica ans Brittany
I don’t really see them seceding anytime soon to be honest
Corsica keeps electing nationalists are their regional parliament but it’s mainly to negotiate special statuses and things like that, they don’t actually want to secede
Nouvelle Caledonie asked for an independence referendum, as promised in their status they can have three referendums with only people living there since the 90’s at least being allowed to vote, if indépendance wins in one of those they are out
They have had two referendums so far which were both in favour of remaining French, the third one will be in September 2022 so we will see then
If the Spanish Basque Country becomes independent the French part will probably join it
None of those are in any way likely to secede
New Caledonia and maybe Polynesia would be the correct answer
I would also say New Caledonia
Corsica could only survive if they join Italy
They are literally dependent on mainland financial support
The tourism don't provide for the whole year
Even if Breton people would want to, Brittany is kilometers away to see that coming
The simple fact that this region is highly strategical for France economically but especially militarly is a dead-end
Same thing for Alsace
I'm not picturing a world while France could allow anyone in the metropolitan area to secede anyway
Brittany had a terrorist independist movement, they have not a lot of support nowadays anyway
Only Corsica and some overseas territories would have support from they own population for independance imho
From what i've heard, French Polynesia is pretty satisfied
The French gov calmed down and FP gained more autonomy
Apparently the separatists have since declined in popularity because of this
Definitely agree about New Caledonia though
It's actually just New Caledonia
New Caledonia is only a few percentage away from independence while Corsica, Brittany and everywhere else are far from being able (and being willing) to be independent
Unless they find a lot of money in their territory (precious ore or oil), they are too poor to afford independence, especially when they have much poorer neighbor independent islands
Mayotte is a good example of this, the Comoros from which it was separated are much poorer and they emigrate to Mayotte
Corsica would go where
It can't sustain itself and is not more Italian than French
There are stray cats, no stray dogs
I know there are programmes to capture and neuter stray cats
Wild boars
Stray cats also are a fauna problem
They’re not that many, so you would likely not notice them, but they are destroyers
There are so many of them
The homeless take care of some of them ( in the city )
I've never seen a stray dog in my life, so I'd say no
I don't think so, there's probably a bunch of stray cats but that's all
In overseas territories, it is much more a problem though
The vets can't spay them fast enough
Don't fuck with my vacation plan
Ah yes I have heard of difficult situations in placces like La Réunion
I am not familiar enough, i was referring to la metropole only, you are right to point that out
Haha, no, I guess it sounds weird in English
They "just" attack birds & little animals, which is pretty awful for the environment
Oh, and they have (lots of) babies too
Blue ink is the most popular colour for handwritten documents
Official documents that need to be scanned sometimes require black ink to be more legible
Pupils and students frequently use fountain pens and only blue ink cartridges can be erased so that makes it the de facto colour of choice
Blue is the standard
Black is used when the [4 couleurs] is out of blue
Well we have color copiers down here
Joke aside, I would say that in the corporate world, there is not so much hand writing anymore, apart from signing documents, and even that is almost digital nowadays
Nonetheless, black is probably preferred for easy copying reasons precisely
So you probably have a point with legal documents, where it is important to be able to identify an original
But with digital documents this is not an issue anymore
Documents are digitally signed and any alteration is traceable
Go to drink with the parents, kids always find home
Here, parents never stay, but it's not the norm to invite all the kids classroom, most birthday parties host about 6 kids for like 2 hours, so it's easy to manage with only one adult
Also a different things with american tvshow: we only have cake (without ice or cream) and sweets, never savory snacks
Birthday parties are generally low key here: everyone play a simple game, then cake, then gifts
And that's it
Current Constitution article 2 first sentence says the language of the Republic is French, which makes teaching in regional languages in public school an issue apparently
Some places try to teach them as foreign languages but they are very few
Isn't Sámi a language more than a dialect
Because it's in a completely different family than Swedish
I'm not sure if this is relevant here, but how much of a different is there between Nynorsk and Bokmål?
Yes it's a family of languages, related to Finnish
You can
Because I'm French and unless someone has a southern accent which is very recognizable, I can't fucking tell if they're from Paris, Lyon, burgundy, Alsace or the north, most people just sound the same with slight variations in expressions used, sometimes
>Even with my poor domain of French I can tell aside Northern accents from Sourthern accents and usually Parisian from all the other ones
Also, if someone says ouitante or nonante or renversé instead of café au lait I'll know they are from la Romandie, for example
Lol ? I'm from Brittany and used to go a lot in eastern France in my chlidhood because of my family from my father's side, now I am in Paris for studies and I can't say at all from what region is someone by hearing him speaking because every native sound the same
Elder people might use regional words sometimes and that's it
My grands-parents from Vosges used alsacian and even german words randomly in their sentences but the way they spoke french was indentical to my family from Brittany
My girlfriend is from Marseille and she doesn't have any accent at all neither
I know english have noticeable accents like the irish one and the american one but french in the metropolitan France is very uniform nowadays
[pan bagnat] typical from Nice, France
Bread is this special pan bagnat shape but it's usual French bread, it's bathed (hence the name) with olive oil, a dash of vinegar, then filled with all the lovely  stuff on the picture, protein part being tuna and hard boiled eggs and anchovies
Baguette, butter and ham
Simple but amazing
I enjoy smoked salmon
Baguette, pesto, parmesan, mozarella, tomato slices
&#x200B;
There's a bakery I know that serve that one in a special baguette that got a bit of olive oil and black olives in it
It's like heaven
Jambon Beurre
A hot dog
Because it's a sandwich
a good « jambon-beurre »: baguette, ham and butter
or a Bánh mì, which is a Vietnamese sandwich made with baguette, vegetables, soy sauce, spices
there can be also meat like chicken
it ‘s delicious !
Jambon Beurre
This so the first thing my sister gets everything she comes back to France
Add some salad so you can say that you are eating healthy
cheese and chocolate
*die in French*
wow, ftira looks appetizing
the hole in the center of the bread brings lots of crunchy crusty part in every mouthful, I bet, that seems great
Always wanted to visit Malta, I really should
salade
I agree that all this is great, but I'm talking about a baguette freshly made from the local bakery, with salted butter and white ham
And there you have perfection itself
or just that you have good taste
the crunch man
true, just a leaf on the side so people can see I'm a healthy boi
What I know under the name "panini"
* It's put in a sort of a press that cooks the sandwich enough for the cheese to melt
* The bread is a white bread made of wheat, like a baguette, but it's thinner, the crust is completely different and the "foam" inside is much thinner than a baguette
* Most places don't use quality ingredients, the cheese will be some cheap crap
* No pesto
wow
that’s just- wow
i’m really curious about the taste but- wow
you know we’ve started revolutions for less than this
à l'italienne
I'm sorry, it was more for the ham part, I'm really not good with words, no matter the language haha
yeah AH AH AH so fun ! we surrendered once but just to remind you, we are the country with the highest amount of military victories in the world
and you Dutchmen, what do you do ? you eat cheese with chocolate
gross
food is sacred
show some respect
BUT, now i might want to try
just scientific curiosity
so what cheese and what chocolate would you recommend ? :)
Some corrupted politicians are going down
Switzerland so I don't need to learn German
Austria
Innsbruck in the winter is one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited, and Vienna is a fantastic city
Germany because my sister is there
I lived in Geneva and it's pretty boring tbh
Recently did a Lyon Marseille (about 1h45 travel) round trip in TGV (high speed train) and paid 80€ for the whole thing
I could have got it for less if I had taken less practical hours as off hours are typically much cheaper
Me and a friend went to visit another friend in Bern, who lives 15-20 minutes away from the city center by tramway, and she made us take the car and park it in the city center for a whole afternoon because it was cheaper than buying tickets for us single trip peasants
In addition to being affordable and fast, it also seems
most of your trains allow bicycles, which is uncommon in Germany and France (not exactly uncommon, but there's specific rules for every different type of train)
Do you agree ?
It’s the same unit, some people just like to mark the plural
It was a round trip in my case so it was actually two tickets so it’s not very expensive
I have no idea
Probably just a personal thing
I remember my physics teacher saying not to do it or it would be confused with kilometer per second
I wouldn’t call it wasted time, it was still informative
I learnt that you had to buy two seats with covid in Italia which is a bit insane for example
Honestly I have experienced both as I worked and lived in both France and Germany
The SNCF has a terrible reputation locally but I find that they always make a plan for their fuck ups
When you are a real regular you can count on them
Not during a strike though
And that can happen fairly regularly, since they generally follow one another
Haven't had one in a while though
In Germany I have experienced huge fuck ups (4hrs late with ICE) and no compensation whatsoever because not everything is automated
Their website and customer care is not on par with the French trains
Prices are expensive on both sides
I'd like to add that the regional trains in France are close to non existent in comparison to Germany, although much cheaper
Reaaaaally uncommon
France is heavily centralized
The US are not centralized, by any definition of the word
You are literally a federal state
Way more
We don't have states, we have regions, they have some powers and budget but can't design local laws or school programs
It's not even decentralized, it's federal
"Decentralized" implies a unitary state
Paris isn't that big, it's 10 km wide in diameter
When friends and family come visit I always chose to walk because in half a day you can pretty much see a lot of the city
It's just one of the densest cities in the world despite buildings not having a lot of levels
The suburbs are huge though, and as they don't want to be annexed by the city of Paris, choosing the agglomeration of Paris makes more sense than just picking the city for population comparisons
[Le Rouge Et Le Noir]
I love reading and I have no issue reading all sort of books
But I couldn't read it further than the first chapter and I'm glad it's was an educational edition with the summary and some comment on each chapter at the end
Le grand meaulnes, of Alain Fournier
This book was (for me) the definition of boredom, as nothing really happen in this book
Le Quart Livre by Rabelais in ancient French
It’s already hard as it is but in ancient French and with all the authors made up words and obscure metaphors and references I just couldn’t comprehend what the fuck was happening most of the time
Never heard of it
Révolution
Lived in the UK for 2 years, food is actually really good !
Not all Nordic people are cold and distant
Only the Finns
Icelanders, Swedes and Norwegians are pretty lit, warm and friendly as fuck
Dont know about Danes and the Faroe Islanders though
by the way, how do you call these ones ? Faroeise ?
EDIT : apparently, according to Google, just Faroe Islanders
That’s kind of a really strange misconception to have in the first place
Some people can’t even affort to travel in their own country you know
Haha I know !
The stereotype is strong !
That’s quite mean
If you have a problem with everyone you meet in France, maybe the problem is actually you
Or you're bitter because you haven't been able to make friends
I wouldn’t go that far, no
If you compare Tesco to Monoprix then sure, Monoprix is better
If you compare Carrefour City or G20 to Waitrose or M&S, French supermarkets aren’t that great
I often shop at Carrefour City and the fruit and vegetables aren’t that good most of the time
Also, you won’t find rabbit, quail, guinea fowl, snails and frogs in every supermarket
I’ve actually never seen any frogs in a French supermarket, like ever
Only once at Tang Frères, so a Chinese supermarket
These aren’t even that common in France so I don’t really see why British supermarkets quality should be based on that
Imo, to truly appreciate a culture you don’t know, you shouldn’t systematically compare it to your own
I try to apply this as much as I can when I’m abroad
I also try to put away my preconceptions, so that I won’t judge too harshly all the new things I try
I obviously missed a lot of French food that I wished I could find in the supermarkets there, but I kept in mind that it was normal and it didn’t keep me from enjoying the things that were available
Is it though
I mean, british beef is amazing
You also have the nice sunday roast (with yorkshire pudding and mushy peas) or sausages and mash
Fish and chips, scotch eggs, english breakfast, roast lamb, chicken and mushroom pie, baked potatoes
I also loved the scones, the caramel shortbread and basically everything that goes with tea, elderflower based drinks, pimm’s, british gin
Also, there’s a huge range of various foreign food if you live in London (and in every big city I guess)
I really enjoyed the food there, honestly
Dont go to Paris, come to the South
Montpellier or Toulouse, namely, you'll see we are bloody warm and fiery
You can even initiate a random conversation with someone in the streets here ! :)
But to be fair, I did it in Reykjavik too
but I guess the people there are used to loud, overly-enthousiast tourists
Honestly, I was halfway joking
At first glance, they were the most distant of all Nordics, but the few Finns I managed to keep talking with for a few days after meeting them, slowly let loose eventually
As Stratovarius said :  *Some might say that we are cold but our hearts are made of gold
To be fair, it's mostly the random talk in the streets that was the cultural clash
I'm from the warm and fiery south of France
Here, it's quite normal to randomly hail someone in the street, complimenting their clothes, reacting to something you overheard or stuff like that
Dont do that in Finland
Really dont
But in bars and pubs, it was easier to approach them, even though you would still get confused looks when you neared them
*"I dont know this guy, I just wanna hang out with my friends, I'm not here to meet strangers
oh, he's speaking English, he's a complete stranger then
well, I guess we dont have a choice, let's make the better out of it I guess
But I still love you and your music Finland !
People are not talkative and into small talk, but during my short stay, all interactions were agreable
10mn after seating in the train from the airport to Helsinky central train station, the lady controlling the tickets talked with me because she enjoyed speaking French and she gave a Moomin goodie to my son
I was like "all I was told about Finland is a lie".
I think in France we look East
That’s sweet ! (I wish I had neighbours who cooked for me)
When French act like cliché French, it’s always hilarious !
>Where did I say that
Only because I find the level of politeness lower than other countries doesn't mean I don't like everyone you idiot
Okay, I have the answer ;)
Well I truly had an amazing time there ! :)
There are metaphorical "deserts" in France as well, like la Creuse (literally "the Hollow"), l'Ardèche, la Lozère
and a lot of unproductive regions, mainly in Central and southern France
We even have our own Napoli, it's called Marseille here
And that's mostly what I was referring to
I found that, especially in Iceland and Sweden, it was much easier to randomly engage in a conversation with people in the streets or in bars
Well, I guess the people of Reykjavik are particularly used to noisy, over-enthusiast tourists
But in the end, I felt less intrusive trying to start conversations with Icelanders and Swedes than with Finns
As I said above, the confused looks you can get from Finns when approaching them made things often awkward
It doesnt really make you feel entirely welcomed
Often in my first days in Helsinki, I would break away and leave as soon as possible, feeling like I was just a bother to them
Then, after some time, I decided to ignore the feeling and insist a bit more, and eventually managed to get full on interesting conversations with people
And even see some of them again in the following days !
And despite what I'm saying, I loved Finland and I know it just takes a bit of time to know them, but in the end, the Finns are awesome
just dont rush them too much
I feel you
I love food but I’d rather avoid this kind of social interactions !
>C'est bon mon ami, certains stereotypes sont vrais
Il n'y a jamais de fumée sans feu
L'indulgence n'est clairement pas notre principale qualité :)
&#x200B;
>bahhh fluttee
Diantre ! For your effort to maintain our outdated interjections, I wish you all the best
I am perfectly relaxed, I sip a raspberry tea while caressing a purring cat
My last message was not sarcastic, it was even supposed to be friendly
For some reasons, the cliché about our supposed rudeness amuses me much more than it annoys me
I'm okay with it, and I also think they don't have to justify their freedom
Shitty questions to ask Europeans, just another excuse to talk shit about Americans, well done
Most French people don’t invest
They generally leave their money on life insurance contracts or « Livret A ».
Otherwise yeah I have enough money for my leisures and I don’t feel like I really have to count pennies so I suppose I am alright
To be very concrete,  I earn about 2000€ net per month, and after all necessary expenses (rent, bills, food etc
) I am left with 500€ to do whatever I want with it, either invest the money, save it or use it to go out in restaurants, buying myself new clothes and other stuff
I am solidly in the middle class, and quite happy with this situation
I thought 20% of the total price was the minimum required for a deposit
I've seen crazy prices in Switzerland for real estate when compared to France, the flat I'm renting in Vaud is worth around 600 kCHF so I would need minimum 120k to buy it and 25 years to reimburse it, crazy prices but doable and I could find cheaper places in Valais
What are you trying to buy at 2
5M?
Edit : I've re-read my comment and I realised that I've worded it a bit bluntly, I didn't meant to diss you I am always surprised by the crazy amount of money people have to put down in Switzerland to buy real estate, even with salaries way of the chart when compared with European neighbors
Anyway, I apologize if I came out rude, it wasn't my intention
Yes, there is no real stock exchange culture in France
Upper class families usually have "better" investments culture, but it is often in real estate, or some bonds, but nothing too dynamic like day trading
Yeah we are pretty old school and risk averse when it comes to investment generally
Sometimes when I try to translate beautiful english words like "[something] the fuck/shit out of them"
It happen to me too, sometime I have the world in English to describe something but I forget the equivalent in french
For example last time i was searching the word for behavior in french which is "Comportement".
I like Danish because it kinda sounds like German, and I love the German language (very much a minority opinion around these parts)
I guess they're all Germanic (except for Finnish), but Danish feels much closer which would make sense
Didn’t hear all of them, but Icelandic, Swedish and Norwegian are my favorite
What is the number 1 TV channel in your country
In France, the first channel is TF1 (which was privatized in the 80s), which is also the most popular channel
However, as a group, in 2020, the goverment run France Télévision group was the most watched (29% of total viewers), closely followed by the TF1 group (27% of total viewers)
In France, private channel TF1 (French TV 1) comes first, then is followed with public service channels France 2, France 3, and France 5 with private encrypted channel Canal+ in 4th
Strangely enough, im from France and i don't even know, tf1
Not boosting about tv, how they are blah blah blah but with prime, Netflix
torrents it's been a while since i saw any channels
You have channels without ad break
That would be impossible in France
TF1 (télévision française 1) which is the first in channel list, is often called "la 1" ("as in switch the to the first one")
Don't France TV have more channels than thé groupe TF1
Especially with France 3 with every régional versions
Most popular
Yes
The second statistic compared the TF1 group (TF1, LCI, TMC) to the France Television group (whch includes France 2, France 3 regional channel amongst others)
Overall, France has (according to google0 over 584 channels available
C'est quoi le délire de se parler en anglais ?
The way that our words are prononces slighly different but spelled absolutely different
(Vers/verre/vers/vair/vert ...)
That even confuses French people and the majority of the Frenchs cannot spell their own hellish language
That nevers bothered me because the context always makes it simple
Even "Passe le verre vert vers moi" (passe me the green glass) is fairly simple
Oh think it's gets really crazy when we talk about "accord genre/nombre" [ french change depending on female/male & numbers]
It also change depending on verb in front or behind
[This movie scene] always comes to mind when I think about German speakers talking sexy to their partners
No, never
Since we learn that 90 is "quatre-vingt-dix" at a very young age, we never really think about what it actually means
It's just 90 to us
I realised that quatre-vingt-dix meant "4x20+10" when I was around 12 haha
Absolutely never
It's just a word for 90
Whether it's called "ninety" or "quatre-vingt-dix" or "kfjzhdoglg" literally makes no difference
Yes
"Comme même" "enfaite" "sa" à la place (instead of) "ça", "er"/"ez"/"é"....
I found the mistakes highly annoying and I don't know why but it makes me lose credibility in the person
Charlemagne would be proud
It'd be a shitstorm in most cases, the most functional might be Germany
Italy is either a perfect union or a direct civil war

Belgium would likely be pissed, same with the Swiss
But you'd just have put us in a quarantine with the UK for a decade or two you either get rid of two dicks at once, or end up with Imperialism 3
0 "La revenge". Quality entertainment
Or we go nuts and create the Franco-Brazilian union, what's the worst that could happen ?
I vote for a merge with Benelux and Germany
France getting Brazil, Germany, Swiss, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Netherlands
*laughs in Empire*
Belgium: We cool except for the north
Germany: We cool
Spain: We cool
Andorra: We cool
Italy: instant cultural civil war
Switzerland and Luxemburg: Oh fuck off with your taxes
Plenty of good options I'd say
+ Germany -> the Carolingian Empire is back baby
+ Italy -> Roman Empire time
+ Spain -> we 100% won the war of the spanish succession
> France: instant civil war over food and wine
Or world domination by mean of wine and food
I don't know
Can confirm
We could reform the roman empire
> France: instant civil war over food and wine
See the good thing, Mona Lisa will be in "your new country". :p

It took me a long time to understand there were other languages
Get me : when looking at a movie or whatever, it was ALWAYS in French
I think what really got me to understand was when I started reading, and upon chosing flags other than the French one on the Gamecube when starting a game, I still couldn't read !
You were so naive, i mean only 3 or 4 of these things are true

Damn we'd be *big* !

> * Greece is next to France
> * Belarus is a French region
Are you living in 1812
Omg
I didn't know there were other countries making jokes saying Belgians were stupid
I thought it was just a French thing
Why did you believe that
I work in logistic (Company with yellow truck to not say it's name), and during the early part of the COVID shitshow I was working in a "oh fuck the route everything is falling apart and we need medical equipment *fast*, we need a solution".
The country that I had the less problem finding solution with was Italy
The ones I had the most problem (in Europe) was Germany and the Netherlands . Italian were like "oh it's gonna be hard but we'll find something to make it happen", Germans and Dutch were mostly  "You see that's not how we work so wait because we say so".
It was *infuriating*.
TIL
For us it's clearly the tower, if not the whole building
Yeah, Super Bock is not that good, however it's light and refreshing in summer when it's hot
No, sadly we have Paris instead
But in truth, we're just jealous of your beers
>Napoleon tried three times and failed three times
The invasion ? Succeeded
three times
The occupation ? Failed three times, with  a huge help from the UK
Well in a situation where we had to improvise *a lot* it's way better
Moreover it's not like my team was working on medical equipment *only*, which were needed as fast as possible
I'm still *mad* at them, we had to explain to some hospitals that they couldn't have mask and other medical equipment for a few days because of some process that weren't done in the Netherlands, oh the joy of having medical staff crying on the phone while I couldn't do shit because of some process had to be respected
Anyway, yeah, "l’arte di arrangiarsi" should be learned by our Germanic friends, cause next time this kind of shit happens, I'm taking a flight over there to break some jaw
Yes
On the adult table there is wine and they make bad bad jokes that a child shouldn't hear
I think it's depend of the family and the number of kids
When I was a child, for christmas, on my mother's side we were 6 kids about the same age
We didn't have a house big enough to have one huge table with everyone so we just had a kid table
I loved it, it was real fun (exept you had to keep remind the adult table to give you some food too
On my mother's side it was just my brother and I, our cousins were teenagers so we didn't have a kid table
Now we have no kids table on both side simply because we didn't have kids anymore
I'm the youngest and I'm 29
I got a toddler now and my cousin too, when we will have more and when they will be old enough to be on their own, we will probably have a kid table again because it's fun for them
When there are more than 4-5 children and they're old enough but not too much so that they eat with adults, then yes
When you're a teenager you often choose between eating with children or adults
Yes, but only if there's at least 4-5 kids
You're not going to bother doing a kids' table for 3 people
Not unless there are both lots of adults and lots of children
It was a widely spread practice in the 1940s, but the French (and, I believe, northern) vision of children changed a lot since
I think there's no norm it's up to each family and I remember as the elder of the family when I was younger I ate with the adults
True
There were 20 or so of us so a kids table made sense
Sure thing when, as you said, there isn’t enough room
I was speaking of daily life & occurrences, gatherings can be different
I wanted to stay at work during the weekend for the AC
They threw me out and I started to melt
Now I’m in the train, they will have to kick me out too I guess
Every time I see people say that all of france is on fire I take it as a step for the independance of Brittany
I'm fine thanks, and you ?
I’m okay, but does anyone know where are the others French people ? I’ve seen more Estonian people than French one on this subreddit
I'm fine, we had an air conditionning war at work, battling for control of the thermostat, it was lovely
Team 22°C seems to have won at the end
I'm sleeping in my oven because it's colder than my house
I'm totally OK
In Belfast
Sure I'm fine, just bought an AC so I feel better than ever
We are minority 'round here
Only problem is this heat
It is like hell, but hell in hell
I’m fine, the sea is warm so it’s nice to get something refreshing with this heat wave
No, no I'm not
I just closed the window 10 mins ago because I don't want bugs flying in, it has been a hellish day
For French to answer they would have to cooperate with the authority of OP
French don't cooperate with any authority
(Also most don't like to tag themself as French online)
I'm good
In Cambridge
If I was home I'd probably be dying
Pretty fine as long as I’m not in the metro
More than the lack of AC, it’s one of the rare times I actually resent my height: I’m at armpit level
I'm okay, but I don't live in France, which is cheating
I'm OK
Why
Doing great, thanks !
&#x200B;
Plot twist: I live in Mexico
It's not right, but it's ok
South of France here
No AC at work or at home
I get up super early in the morning to get some fresh air in the house in
I'll make it !
There are dozens of us ! DOZENS !
First of all, I don't completely agree
There is always one or more answers from French people to the questions asked
&#x200B;
Secondly, French bashing seems to be part of the Reddit's DNA especially in some subs
Personally, I can ignore it, but I know that some of our fellows may be hurt
Some still find the stamina to teach history classes but don't  last long in front of the extent of the pack's bad faith
This topic [is regularly discussed] on r/France
I think I can recognise the same 20 or so French on this sub, it's quite funny
Faut sortir un tuyau de la fenêtre ? Et est ce que y’a de l’eau qui sort dans un réservoir où tu dois le vider chaque qlq heures ?
Yeaaaaah
I'm going to Erquy today and the water is said to be at 16°C.
It's not a competition friendo
Are you saying that Britanny flag is bad, because if so you should fear for your life
Qu’est-ce qu’il dit !?
Very funny
Bien sûr !
It's a mobile AC
Oui faut faire sortir un tuyau par la fenêtre ce qu'est assez chiant, pour l'instant je me suis fais une installation homme des cavernes avec les volets à moitié ouverts, une seule des deux fenêtres à moitié ouverte, le tuyau dehors avec un rideau derrière pour stopper les insectes et un bout de la chaleur d'entrer, je suis en train de chercher un kit de calfeutrage partout en ville pour pouvoir bloquer totalement ma fenêtre, ils en avaient pu là où j'ai acheté ma clim, et je viens d'appeler tous les magasins du coin, personne en vend et les deux seuls qui en vendent n'ont plus de stock
Mais bon de base j'ai réussi à relativement réduire les degrés d'au moins ma chambre (genre 26-27 au lieu de 29-30) donc j'ai au moins pu dormir correctement
Pas de réservoir d'eau que je sache, ils me disent juste de vidanger par ci par là (pas tous les jours), je sais pas trop comment ça se passe mais je verrai quand le jour viendra
I haven't looked into that, it's too much of a sacrifice for the pesky bugs
I haven't looked into it either, but only just buying shutters took me 3 weeks in France because I had to order them in the right size
And this was with modern windows with a clear serial number
At my parents' house it would fail entirely
The way many windows are set up doesn't really let a space for a wire screen
There are lots of people in close quarters so it doesn’t matter that you’re underground
There’s been lots of delays due to people fainting and being sick
2-1
it was close but so far away
Je crois qu'il parle d'une recette de "riz quoïeur". Et qu'il est drogué et qu'il s'pique
Nah you should have your AC set 10 degrees below the temperature outside
Merci beaucoup :D  je dois acheter un clim alors
It's the best looking flag ever !!!!
&#x200B;
(it's the united states flag but with bombs instead of stars !!!!)
Non de doué, qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire sur moi, petite salope ? Sache, môsieur, que j'ai terminé premier de ma classe de fest noz, que j'ai participé à de nombreux raids secrets sur le Mont Saint michel, et que j'ai plus de 300 meurtres confirmés.
J'suis entraîné à la guerre du mazout   et j'suis le meilleur joueur de biniou  d'élite de toutes les forces armées bretonnes
T'es rien pour moi, juste une autre cible
J'vais t'anéantir avec un putain de son de la mort comme on n'en a jamais vu sur Terre, crois-moi
Tu crois qu'tu peux t'en tirer en me sortant ça sur Internet ? Réfléchis à deux fois, sale plouc de merde
En ce moment même, j'suis en train de contacter mon réseau secret d'espions bretons à travers le monde et ton adresse ip est en cours de traçage
Prépare toi bien à la tempête, molusque
La tempête qui anéantira la pathétique petite chose que tu appelles ta vie
T'es mort, gamin
J'peux être n'importe où, n'importe quand, et j'peux te tuer de plus de sept cents façons, quite à  te gaver comme une oie de kouign Aman
Non seulement j'ai reçu une formation poussée en combat non armé, mais j'ai aussi accès à tout l'arsenal des drapeaux bretons de la région
J'les enfoncerai bien profond dans ton cul pour effacer ta sale geule du continent, petite bite
Si seulement t'avais su dans quelle merde ta p'tite remarque "intelligente" allait t'apporter, t'aurais fermé ta putain de gueule
Mais tu ne pouvais pas, tu ne l'as pas fait, et maintenant tu va en payer le prix
Je vais te chier dessus et tu vas te noyer dedans
T'es mort, gamin
Ces albionnais sont incompréhensibles
The 34°C AC in Nîmes should've hurt yesterday
I didn't have a choice, I wanted to buy one on the internet but they were all sold out or to be sent within "a month or two", I couldn't wait this long, went to many shops yesterday, all sold out
Only today I called one shop and they told me they just received some mobile ACs and I should be coming fast because they were getting sold very quickly, got there, bought one, it's a Blyss, don't know how bad or good it is
>it's the united states flag
C'est justement pour cela qu'il est pathétique
C'est marrant toutes ces références à la Bretagne, et à côté de ça une sur le Mont Saint Michel qui n'a aucun rapport
I put my heating at 22 when I want a boost of heat in winter hahahaha
23 is the perfect temperature
Of course it is a cool flag
J'avoue que j'aime pas le drapeau des états-unis (surtout parce que je les aime pas en général) et que c'est vraiment dommage que le Gwenn ha Du s'en soit inspiré, mais je faisait surtout référence au tweet de je ne sais plus quelle journaliste qui ne le connaissais pas
[Here is the tweet he was speaking about
ಠ_ಠ
[Btw]
I don't intend to let it on all the time, the heat don't bother me that much during the day, it's at night, I cannot sleep when it's +30° in my bedroom
Been 3 days in a row with 5 hours of sleep a day, might be normal for some people but not me, I'm dying
Ah oui ! Il me semblait bien l'avoir déjà vu
Un plaisir de le revoir
Du scheinst sehr selbstbewusst
Kennst du sie privat

I found two:
- "A breath of laughter will blow a government out of existence in Paris much more effectually than a whiff of canon smoke
" By Robert Barr
- "A place of pain and suffering is also a place of freedom
" By Margaret Stewart about post war but I think it can also be about the French resistance during WWII

You just made an enemy for life !
The French "Supreme Court" is called the *Conseil Constitutionnel*, the Constitutional Council
There are 9 members: 3 are appointed by the President of the Republic, 3 by the President of the National Assembly (lower house of Parliament), 3 by the President of the Senate
They are appointed for 9 years, and every 3 years 3 of them are replaced, with the 3 "presidents" picking one each
Former Presidents of the Republic are members by rights after their mandate has ended, but only former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing still take parts in deliberation (although he is 96 now)
The other Presidents still alive (Sarkozy & Hollande) don't sit on the Council (Sarkozy did for half a year)
Depends on which topic
Cour de Cassation is the judiciary organ that checks whether trials are done correctly or not
Conseil d'Etat is the administrative organ
Tribunal des Conflits checks whether it's the first one or the second one that has to deal with a case
Conseil Constitutionnel can do both checking whether a law is constitionnal or not, and set (some) legal precedents
We use a system that's closer to Civil Law than Common Law so we don't really have a Supreme Court
It's not popular because it's not a job where you're very seen in the media, you're getting forgotten
It's a like a retirement house for politicians
4x20+10+9 quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (99)
But honestly, Belgian people say it way much better than we do, they merely say nonante-neuf
I know 4 languages so I can tell for French, German and Hungarian:
In French we have a word for all numbers from 0 to 16 (seize), then we say 10+7 (dix-sept), 10+8 (dix-huit) and 10+9 (dix-neuf)
All numbers between 20 and 69 are regular except 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 because we add an extra "et" (and), e.g. vingt is 20 but vingt-et-un is 21, while vingt-deux is 22, vingt-trois is 23 etc
From 70 to 79, we keep 60 (soixante) as the base and add 1-19 numbers (71 = soixante-et-onze, ..., 79 = soixante-dix-neuf), then numbers from 80 to 99 use quatre-vingt(s) (four twenties) as a base so 80 is quatre-vingts, 81 is quatre-vingt-un, 82 is quatre-vingt-deux, ..., 99 is quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (literally "four twenties ten nine")
German is pretty easy, they have their own numbers until 12, then add "-zehn" to 3-9 numbers to create 13-19 numbers (e.g. 3 is drei and 13 is dreizehn)
Then to create multiples of tens after 20, just take a number between 2 and 9 and add "-zig" (sometimes the radical changes a bit, that's why you have zwanzig, dreißig, sechzig and siebzig instead of zweizig, dreizig, sechszig and siebenzig but all others are regular: vierzig, fünfzig, achtzig, neunzig)
To create compounded numbers, e.g. siebenundachtzig, you say 7 und (and) 80
Under 1 million, everything is written in a single word so 777 777 is written siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebenhundertsiebenundsiebzig
In Hungarian, they have their own words for numbers up to 10
Then 11 is tizenegy (tíz/10 + en/on/ön which is used to combine numbers below 30 + egy/1), 12 is tizenkét or tizenkettő, ..., 19 is tizenkilenc
20 is húsz, 21 is huszonegy (notice that the -en- became -on- to respect the vowel harmony rule, and tíz and húsz lost their accents because the vowels were shortened)
After 29, use -van/-ven to create the multiples of 10 except három/3 thãt becomes harminc/30
Négy/4 becomes negyven/40, öt/5 becomes ötven/50, hat/6 becomes hatvan/60, hét/7 becomes hetven/70, nyolc/8 becomes nyolcvan/80 and kilenc/9 becomes kilencven/90
To create compounded numbers after 29, just put them together like 79 is hetvenkilenc
Like German, you don't need to separate words below 1 million (in some dialects only, else you have to add an hyphen between thousands) so 999 999 is kilencszázkilencvenkilencezerkilencszázkilencvenkilenc or kilencszázkilencvenkilencezer-kilencszázkilencvenkilenc
Yep, english and french sounds are very different
There is no sound for "Un" in english, nor for the "eu" of "deux". The "oi" of 3 should be ponounced "wa", The "in" in "5" is pronounced like un
Same way to wite it almost same pronounciation
Pronounced "Wit" Neuf
"Eu", the return
"Onze" "On" has a weir pronounciation for english people I guess
I love how chat is written exactly like how we say cat in French
Es wurde einfacher zu zahlen aber sehr merkwürdig zu verwenden
>Trivia: "hét" (7) derives from the Proto-Uralic *säptɜ which in fact comes from Proto-Indo-European, so it's a cognate of pretty much all Indo-European equivalents: seven, sieben, siete, sept, zeven, sju, seacht, septyni, siedem, sedam, семь (sem'), सात (saat) etc
In Hungarian, just like in the Ancient Greek ἑπτά (heptá), the s turned into a "h" sound
Ez nagyon érdekes soha nem hittem azt hogy indoeurópai lenne
Actually we prononce 80 and 4 20 differently (80: "quatr-e vin" ≠ 4 20 "quatr vin"
If it's 4,20 we usually say "quatre virgule vingt/deux" or using the unit instead of the comma (4
2m = quatre mètres vingt, 4
2€ = quatre euros vingt)
So it can't be confusing
well, it'll sound weird if you say that in France, because we do not use that
Most would probably understand what you mean however
But if you say this in Nantes or everywhere else in France people will laugh at you
How to fuck up vowel harmony in 1 step
I'm from the South, I pronounce both the same, with a schwa between *quatre* and *vingt*.
De már lattám "kettőezertizenkilenc" and "kettőezerhúsz" az egyik szóként
Thanks I have it but I forgot to put it lol
>Except they fuck everything up from 70 to 99
Maybe I should try to learn Catalan lol
Some would probably laugh just because they're not used to hear these words, but not laugh at a person who would say that
Most would just smile and say something like "oh, you must be Swiss or Belgian"
Yeah uwu (*laughs in quatre-vingt-dix-neuf*)
I know that's what I say lol
Akkor ha használok a 999999-et egy évszámként, írhatok kilencszázkilencvenkilencezerkilencszázkilencvenkilencet
>you're too anglo saxon for us
Can you repeat this oO
We have an old German submarine base in Bordeaux, France
A part of it has been turned in a museum and they recently made a cultural place with beautiful light shows : [link]
I grew up next to the old NATO General Headquarters for Europe in Rocquencourt (le camp de Voluceau) . It was used from 1951 to 1967
These days the barracks and general infrastructure are used as a fire station and research center for IT
It's an interesting place
It was an Italian submarine base at first, before being taken over by the Germans
In some galleries, there are still mines underwater, they are closed off
Another WW2 German submarine base in my town (Lorient) in Brittany
After the war the French Navy took it over but it was sold off in the 90s. There are some marine industrial units there now and there has been a museum built which is open for the public and you can tour the submarine pens
I for one did not know there was a survey
Too bad
Actually if you're on reddit you speak English way better than the french average
Reddit is almost unknown in France
r/France is quite active though
(Though mainly in French)
Obviously the Daft punk, David guetta and dj snake
Several years ago, Jean Michel jarre was very popular as well
In term of singers, maître gims, indila, edith piaf, aznavour, mylene farmer, Gainsbourg, Alizee etc
David Guetta and the Daft Punk
Many fellow frenchies have already answered so I'd just like to add Caravan Palace to the ones they have cited
We have this singer called Zaz, quite known in France but lot in the best of ways
One time a Mexican person told me she was really famous in Mexico, just seemed very random
I remember Lena, who won Eurovision in 2010 with “Satellite”. That's basic pop but still like it
So many fucking good Power Metal out of Germany !
Finland rocks so fucking much
But I always wonder with all these bands, if we can really call them famous
I mean, as a Metalhead myself, I know them all and know how huge their concerts are, but I'm wondering if someone who's never even tried Metal ever heard those names
TIL Shirley Bassey was Welsh
Demis Roussos and Nana Mouskouri are pretty famius in France
Manu Chao
Pretty fucking big in Latin America
On the top of my mind:
* [L'Italiano] by Toto Cotugno
* [Felicita] by Al Bano
* [Ti amo] by Umberto Tozzi (may be the best known italian song in France)
* [Sarà perchè ti amo] by Ricci e Poveri
Bonus:
* [Le Rital] by Claude Barzotti
Yeah, I know (and love that), my question is more alongside the lines of: let's say an American who's never listen to Metal
has (s)he ever heard the name Nightwish
Of course these bands are internationally famous inside the Metal community
but are they internationally famous overall outside of the Metal community
I doubt it, sadly
I have no doubt even a Finn who doesnt listen to Metal has heard at least once some Ensiferum
but the question is "internationally", not "nationally"! :)
No, I did not know
In fact I had not noticed he actually says “Arriverderci Roma” in the song
Thanks
You say hello before every interaction with anyone
You get in the bus: bonjour to the driver; need some help in a shop: bonjour to the sales assistant; you enter a waiting room with people already there: bonjour to them
Ask a random person in the street for direction: Bonjour
If you don’t it’s like not recognising people existence as human beings
When you leave: merci, au revoir/ bonne (journée/soirée)
Unless you live in Paris
We don't have time for hello/thanks/bye
Well that's about the same in France, glad to know I wouldn't be awkward if I went to a doctor's in south Poland
Aah in Bayern sagte ich immer "hallo", jetzt verstehe warum sie mich seltsam ansahen
Well we complain a lot as well and it doesn't impeach to greet people :)
Akkor ez hogy megy a vidéken
I don't agree, i live near Paris and it's still a must
Would be rude not to actually
Except for at the bakery
Best not slip up, motherfucker
La "province" >>> Paris de toute façon
Tout à fait d'accord !
Na ich hörte beide
I would recommend [Le Roi et l’Oiseau] by Paul Grimault, the old schools Astérix movies ([Astérix le Gaulois] [Astérix et Cléopâtre] ), [les Douze travaux d’Astérix] and most movies by Michel Ocelot ([Kirikou et la Sorcière] [Azur et Asmar] [Princes et princesses]
When I was a kid I also watched Code Lyoko on TV
Amazing show alternating between 2D and 3D, comically large heads and [killer theme] [Galactik Football] was top tier too
Edit: as mentioned by mes gars sûr below, the « Il était une fois
» series were masterpieces and taught kids about history, the human body and space, amongst others
Check out [Once upon a time
Mankind] and its dramatic/terrifying intro, [Once upon a time
Life] and [Once upon a time
Space]
Hey, while we're at it, some classics like Inspector Gadget and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a lot of work done in France, and they qualified as "French" for subsidy purposes
And them the're lesser known but still great classics like the Mysterious Cities of Gold, and the "Once upon a time" series
I learned not long ago that Ratz, space goofs (les zinzins de l’espace) are also french
In recent years we also have Last Man, Poupoudou, Vermines, Long way North (Haven’t seen it but it looks quite beautiful), a part in the red turtle, my life as a courgette, I lost my body, Waltz with Bachir
We also have one of the best animation school in the world Les Gobelins in which students have to a short film to graduate that are shown at the Annecy Festival and are available on Yt
Totally Spies is also French and is the most exported French cartoon ever
The recent asterix movies too, asterix and the secret of the magic potion is just great
I’d add Le tableau (The painting)
It’s about characters of a painting who are discriminated because the painter half painted them, and never finished his work
One “fully painted” and a “half painted” are in love: Lola (the half painted) decide to find the painter, and ask him to resume painting
Edit: way to many “paint-something” in these sentences
I would add valse avec Bachir even if it’s not solely french but germano-Israeli-french
And le chat du rabbin
More recently, the Wakfu series and the Dofus movie are also great
I hope they'll eventually make the sequels
Mais comment j’ai pu oublier les Il était une fois ! Par contre honte à moi, à part le générique je connais rien des Mystérieuses cités d’or
Aaahhhhhh les Ratz
Impossible to see them again nowadays (as I'm not a child anymore), but damn did I live them
And I saw so many les Gobelins productions on YouTube
Top tier
Nice
Did you ever read Asterix and the Goths
What did you think about it
I have fond memories of traveling in Europe with my family and there would always be German TV channels in hotels
So I ended up watching lots of German cartoons even though I never understood what was said
Schnappi das kleine Krokodil is engraved in my memory
Ok but the post was about animation
Les Mystérieuses cités d’or ca n'a pas tres bien veillit, pour etre honnete
Je les ai manquees quand j'etais petit, et je n'ai jamais reussit a tous les voir, meme si j'ai le box set DVD depuis 20 ans et des poussieres
La cucaracha is a basic of middle school Spanish lessons in France aha
Don’t ever watch the movie they made about Asterix at the Olympics then
They tried to make a pan-European show (they even got Michael Schumacher, Monica Bellucci, Benoît Poelvoorde) but it turned out to be a complete shitshow
I never thought it would have any success outside of France and Belgium
Oh, I know one
In european portuguese, "rapariga" means "young lady/Miss".
In brazilian portuguese, it means "whore".
So NEVER call a girl "rapariga" in Brasil, go by "senhora".
When I was in Belgium I met a bunch of Walloons that would use "excited" in the English sense, i.e "enthusiastic"; in France, it only means "aroused", so I was a bit confused at first
[Here's] an article that deal with the French (from France) meaning of the word
In France, "gosse" is a common familiar word for kid
In Quebec, it means testicule
So when you say "T'as pas vu mes gosses ?" (Have you seen my kid ?) in Quebec can create quite a funny situation
This is wrong
Joder absolutely means "to screw" even in Spain
No me jodas, estoy jodido
> Similarly, in BR-PT "pica" means "cock", in European Portuguese the main usage refers to "energy".
I imagine Pikachu sounds weird in Brazil
Didn't see that, thanks
I've edited it
France, Portugal, Germany and Hungary in the same group
Who knows
For me this championship can be sometime considered harder than the world cup, I mean, you can meet Italy, Spain, Germany and Belgium
I think I would be very happy for us to go to SF
EDIT: I just remember who are in our group, so I am not so sure any more about that SF
It s doable if we survive the group F
Probably decently
I haven't followed much news about football recently, but from what I've gathered it has been a bit of a mess
let's hope to be closer to 2016 than 2008
If we get out of the group I can definitely see the team win the Euros
In my opinion we have the best team by a large margin , the group is better than in 2016 and is better than in 2018 but this is only on paper, many things can happen in football
For that we need to get out of our group
We’ve got the best team and we won the WC
The team is the same and we even have more promising young players
If everything goes well we might win
I am not too worried about the group stage tbf, with the new version of the tournament you can end 3rd and still make it through
However I expect things to get tougher from the second round
Sincere question, has he become an idol in Portugal
Or do they talk bad of him, when he's disappointing (i.e. all the time except this cursed final)
Ice burns doesn't it
We haven't been playing that well lately, but a competition is something different, so I hope for the best
Honestly, Sweden was good when Ibra was still young, when he grew the team had some of its worst results in decades
That points as him being more of a handicap, but maybe he'll show everybody wrong this time
I love how Spanish sounds
Like, when Penelope Cruz argue in Spanish with Javier Bardem in Vicky Cristina Barcelona it's so hot
German for the beauty of its structure, Japanese for how  it generally sounds, especially the small sounds (onomatopees ? don't know the word in English)
If I believe some American people it would have been much more common without them
I learned Breton for two years in middle school
I don't remember much of it, apart from a swear phrase our teacher taught us: "kor pichen tom" (not sure about the writing)
It means "hot pigeon poop". xD
Not exactly this but I think Finntroll sings in Swedish
Did not meet many German people speaking good French but honestly I feel like most foreign accents sound nice
Having been at a uni which had a few French-speaking Germans, it doesn't sound particularly offensive nor attractive
It's a fairly neutral accent
Wellington, Trafalgar, etc
most British heroes aren't seen in a good light here
Bismarck isn't liked here either for obvious reasons
I'm not an expert, I only know a bit from Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast -- but my impression is that Radetzky was a very competent and fair general, who always offered amnesty after winning a battle, letting captured soldiers go home if they promised not to fight again
This is in contrast to some other generals of the Italian War and Revolutions of 1848, who severely punished defeated enemies and even carried out massacres
But obviously, I wouldn't like Radetzky either if I were Italian
Oh yeah, I can't sleep with the heatwave, I'm tired
Given how the French suck or are reluctant at learning foreign languages, I'm not the least worried about the French language disappearing
I'm more concerned about the poor level of grammar the younger generations seem to have, especially when it comes to writing skills
And it's quite the same for French, a lot of African countries have French as an official language + Québec (Canada) + Switzerland + Belgium + France
But I think the true reason why French isn't going to disappear is because we're just really bad at learning other languages x)
[Stilt-mounted shepherds] in southwest France
The terrain in the area called the *Landes* was/is very boggy, so shepherds were using stilts to keep an eye on their sheep and navigate the terrain
It allowed them to move around quite fast: one of them, [Sylvain Dornon] (fr) was able to travel from Paris to Moscow in 58 days
[Love the Zaporozhian March]
The Basque flag is on the flag of St Pierre and Miquelon, two French islands near Canada alongside with the Breton and Norman flags for such reasons
Anyone not answering "right now" is overestimating their chances of survival in any other time period
Clearly post-WW2, 1950-1980
Ah good answer
Can't say that I have been following very closely, but I know a victory for PiS is not what I want
So I'd agree with your assesment there
explain Italy then ?
Do you have dubbing jokes ?
It could be anything ! A character changing nationality/accent or simply text changing
For example in Tropico 5, Penultimo is supposed to make a "french surrender" joke when you're invaded
But in French, the 4th wall is broken and Penultimo says that the voice actors refused to be part of the joke and that they sent to Tropico a 3D map of Verdun, a picture of the Douaumont Boneyard and a signed picture of Maréchal Lattre de Tassigny
So, any funny dubbing jokes on your side ?
>For example in Tropico 5, Penultimo is supposed to make a "french surrender" joke when you're invaded

Really
Oh damn I didn't know, I tried Tropico 5 a while ago and didn't really like it, but if the dub is funny like that, maybe I should've kept playing a little bit more
In the latest edition of the Dalton's cartoon (Lucky-Luke) there's an episode where a rugbyman comes into the prison, wearing a kilt and all
I guess in the English speaking version he has a Scottish (Welsh ?) accent
In the French one he has a Southwest accent (Basque Country) because that's where rugby is the most popular in the country so it'd make more sense cause we're so bad at English that people would probably not be able to differentiate between accents
In French the pun when Fred loses an ear was particularly well translated as well
In English he makes a joke about being "holy". In French he makes a pun about having an aureola - which sound close to the French for ear-ling/ear-ish
(Not a real word, but it adds a suffix which conveys the meaning)
Asterix Mission Cléopâtre is also a classic in France
We get a similar joke IIRC
The Euro 2012 joke is a funny one
Our is truly awful
Somehow "MASENNNKO" became "RAYON MAGIQUE !" (Magic beam)
The legolas thing comes from the OV
Your dubbing teams seem fun
Yeah but Astérix Mission Cleopâtre has a very special resonnance in France
It's a symbol of what we call the "Humour Canal" and marks a turning point in french comedy
Same for us, he's named "petit coeur" and sometimes picollo
34 in France
You can't pass near a big city without see one of them
TBF we have a lot more people too
we have approximatelly 1 Ikea per 1,97 million inhabitant
Sweden has 1 per 500k inhabitants
Thank you for the account
It's interesting to see the differences between countries, although the continuing racism is depressing
Who is that "Europe" person you refer to ?
What
Racism isn't only a white -> the others thing
Western Europe I'd say ? Although I must underline that there is absolutely zero debate on that matter here afaik
I dont think french people would say France belongs to a specific group of country, aside europeans ones
"Western Europe" is very very rarely used in french ( Europe de l'Ouest )
France, UK, Denmark, Iceland, The Netherlands are further west
Or they will just say France as an answer
So you are between east/northern Africa and Southern Europe
I'm... Not sure we live in the same reality, or maybe there is another Montenegro which I don't know about
Probably because the North of France is culturally more in line with northern Europe / Celtic / Germanic culture VS the South of France which is definitely Latin (except for the Basque country)
We're some kind of a hybrid country, but so are others, like Switzerland with its different official languages
Kerguelen islands for example
It's super interesting, in a way, because Southern France definitely is Southern Europe in cultural terms - while the North, where I'm from, has a clear Flemish vibe in some aspects, and a Midlands mining town in others
I like this stat
The Açores are just in the middle of the ocean, don't talk about forgetting ultramarine territories if you just take one as your reference
Yeah but Eastern Africa seriously
I don't think so
It depends on the people
I'd say there's a narrow majority, in my circle of friends, who do take them off at home (so obviously I'd follow suit if visiting), but it's pretty close
Yes
First thing I do when going home is removing my jacket and shoes
I usually walk barefoot, or with socks
Oysters and a lot of sea food and sea dishes (like Bouillabaisse, Soupe de poisson) were considered like food for the peasantry
Now every tourist going to normandy will have oyster and every tourist going to provence will try a Bouillabaisse
Most staples of traditional French food, very much like Italy, are poor people food, except it's been upgraded a bit
Baked beans no
I was thinking of pain perdu
French toast is served as a breakfast dish in the US if I'm not mistaken, with different toppings
But here, it's leftover stale bread that you make for a snack more than a meal
In my house, we just put a bit of sugar on top and eat it with our hands as a 4pm snack
It's not something you can get in restaurants in France
And if we go really back in the days, caviar also was a leftover from sturgeon
In Paris, there is the [world's largest McDonalds] on the Champs Elysees
But My favourite is the [McDonald's  rue Saint Lazare]  which used to be an Alsatian brasserie
The outside is very unique, but the interiors are also great
[This McDonald's] rue Saint-Lazare, Paris, is an official historic monument
I feel sorry you got a bad experience
Should I say I am not surprised
Service in Mc Donald's is usually crappy, add Paris and the Champs Elysees to the equation, and you have the perfect storm
'[Le chant des partisans]
Resist
Well during each match won during the football world cup, people sing a certain part of this song, where there are no lyrics, at 2:07
"Ramenez la coupe à la maison" by Vegedream, the French song for the FIFA World Cup 2018
Le chant des partisans, maybe l'internationale and the song for the 98 world cup
Le Chant du Départ [ the French National Anthem under the First Empire (Napoléon Bonaparte)
It's still considered by many french as our 2nd Anthem
It's a revolutionary song, not gonna translate the whole lyrics (you have it [on wikipedia] but the refrain means:
>The Republic is calling us
Let's know how to vanquish or let's know how to perish
A Frenchman must live for her \[the Republic\]
For her \[the Republic\] a Frenchman must die
Every time this song is played, a Frenchman is starting a revolution
ahhh j'en peux plus de cette chanson
Dès que la France gagne un match de foot t'es sûr qu'elle va passer en boucle
Limite je préfère Vegedream, ramener la coupe à la maison
even your prime minister ;)
Yeah it's normal in France
Duck is life
We also use duck fat to cock vegetables
Rabbit is still quite common, at least there’s always some at my local butcher and though I don’t cook it myself I really like it
It’s very lean
I’ve had deer only once, and I didn’t think anything of it
I mean we eat snails, frogs, pheasants and stuff so it's not like if eating rabbits was unusual
It was in the past, but not so much anymore
If you'd do it nowadays it will definitely be in the countryside, not in cities
Quick story: my grandma used to have a pet rabbit when she was a kid
During holidays she had to take him to her grandparents to be watched over while she would be away from home
Once she came back, she learned that her grandparents ate the poor thing
She was devastated and ever since is terrified every time she hears about people eating rabbits
Is there anything we don't eat here anyway ?
About 10-15€/kg
Between 10 and 20 € per kg i would say, depending of the quality of the supermarket/butchery where is it sold
For example rabbit with mustard sauce is a classic french dish for the sunday family meal
Snails are fine as fuck tho, frogs are even better
My company moved me here
"Not wanting to be swiss is a very Swiss attitude"
hmmm
Tu l'as dit, cousin
I don't think we don't like each other
Many many French do love Italian culture, cuisine, language, etc
Si, ho visto e sentito questa espressione molte volte perciò usarla
Ciò nonostante, pochi preferiscono fratelli invece di cugini
>L’hai fatto a scuola
No, autodidatta principalmente
Sto imparando il tedesco al momento
Comunque, ho molto da fare per migliorarmi e molto da imparare
> Parte “usarla”, che è sbagliato, (è “l’ho usata”)
Actually, I wanted to use the present tense to mean it as a generality
Don't forget to drink water
A few don't match : Na (*Sodium*), K (*Potassium*), N (*Azote*), Sn (*Étain*), Hg (*Mercure*), W (*Tungstène*)
But it's not really surprising, scientific names don't always follow common names
The only ones that don't make sense in French are Potassium, Sodium, Tin and Antimony I guess
Tungsten and Mercury make sense but aren't obvious
Most of them make sense, they are based on either latin or greek which are the two main roots of French language
So things like Iron = Fe, Copper = Cu, Silver = Ag, Lead = Pb, Gold = Au make sense
Lavoisier was already calling Aluminium "Alumine" in French so when Davy called it Aluminium and it sticked it wasn't weird
Limestone is called Calcaire in French so Davy's Calcium isn't a problem
Mercury symbol comes from greek composed word hydragyros, "liquid-silver". Kinda like the english word quicksilver or the French word vif-argent
Old French word for Mercury used to be hydragure and here is the same Hg
Tungsten ore is called Wolframite, as far as I am aware
Lavoisier created some greek rooted words
Some sticked (hydrogène, oxygène), some sticked in English but not in his native French (nitrogène)
Humphry Davy on the other hand used to create latin sounding name such as Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, etc
and the trend continued (Polonium, Uranium, etc
A lot do as a lot of the elements are based on latin names
Carbone (C), Oxygène (O), Fer (Fe), Natrium (Na), Kalium (K), Cuivre (Cu)
Sodium (Na), Azote (N) and Or (Au) are the only 3 examples where the periodic table don't works in french
Most of the other do though
Most that don't match have or used to have similar words in French, like minerals
Hg was hydrargure in French long ago, from latine name
Lavoisier and co changed the name to Mercure (used by alchemists along with vif-argent, that is close to the name in many other languages) as it is a simple element
Wolframite is the French name of the  ore containing tungstène, Natron is the same with sodium, etc
It's the same in many European languages
Natrium (sodium) and Kalium (potassium) are words in French
in particular they're still used in the medical domain (where we use the words "natrémie" and "kaliémie" notably)
Azot = N because one French chemist named it Azote ("deprived of life" with a greek root) and another French one named it Nitrogène ("that generate salpeter" with a greek root too)
English preferred the later (consistent with hydrogen and oxygen he also named), while romance languages gang preferred the former
Except Spanish, of course
Lavoisier called it hydrogen because hydro and gennaô (ὕδωρ and γεννάω), meaning it causes or generates water
He also named oxygen (ὀξύς) because it generates sharpness/acidity
He thought the biggest trait of oxygen was to create acids
Yes they do
Of course there are exceptions, but just look:
- Hydrogène (H)
- Hélium (He)
- Bore (B)
- Oxygène (O)
- Fluor (F)
- Argent (Ag)
- Lithium (Li)
- Carbone (C)
- Aluminium (Al)
- Silicium (Si)
- Néon (Ne)
- Argon (Ar)
- Krypton (Kr)
- Xénon (Xe)
- Phosphore (P)
- Soufre (S)
- Chlore (Cl)
- Magnésium (Mg)
- Fer (Fe)
- Chrome (Cr)
- Cobalt (Co)
- Nickel (Ni)
- Manganèse (Mn)
- Cuivre (Cu)
- Zinc (Zn)
- Iode (I)
- Radon (Rn)
Etc
etc
>Silver - Argint
Gold - Aur
Nitrogen - Azot
Clap your hands
Argent, Or and Azote in French
Damn gonna love this language proximities
Hydrargyrum is close to "quicksilver", the old english name for mercury
Well no worries, I'm not quite sure about how "French" is Romanian, surely there are loads of loanwords etc, but I swear I can understand you guys more than Spanish or Italian sometimes
Well yes of course, you gave a pretty good example with somaj
( The French pronunciation is slightly towards sh like 'she' in English tho, but it's close enough to understand )
Mind you that my level on both Italian and Spanish are abysmal, so at least I'm not biased towards a certain language
It raises a question since I chose Spanish as a second language at school, but anyway that's another story ... !
Nope :/
At least not languages that are too close to French
But Basque, Breton, Alsatian etc
are doing better
There are remnants of regional languages but aside in Corsica they are not widely spoken at all
For example in my region of Brittany wich has a strong identity and regional pride, and while Breton language is on a lot of roadsigns and pushed as an optionnal language in highschool, no one speak it on a daily basis and overall very very few people are fluent in it
Most of people over here don't even know the grammar or how to build any sentence in Breton
I still have to meet someone actually speaking a regional language
I think they’re dying, if not already dead
There’s also Catalan
You did not extend on Breton so I’ll just add this: it’s been given a new strength the last few decades
People want to learn it, more and more
This means that while the different BretonS are disappearing (there used to be thousands of ways to speak Breton), there is a new surge of the language
Putain mais c'est incroyable, il y a vraiment personne qui sait que le Catalan est aussi parlé en France ou quoi ?
> Alsatian is spoken by roughly half the population of Alsace
Actually it's more around 20% and mainly elder people ( [ )
And, once again, the savoyards are being left out !
You wouldn't make your way in Brittany speaking only Breton
Dialects in France are not at all like in Italia
Talleyrand, the shadow behind Napoleon
He was great at diplomacy and knew most people that counted in Europe so Napoleon made him foreign ministry and so he negociated many deals sometimes at Napoleon’s behest sometimes against Napoleon’s own interests
He had his own vision for the future of Europe which greatly clashed with Napoleon’s. Napoleon cared too much about glory and thought the only way to stop getting attacks on France would  be to rule over the countries who would attack it
He was a military genius and was pretty good at ruling France but he was not good at all when it came to global politics, diplomacy and long term thinking
Talleyrand thought that peace would come from trade and mutual prosperity and that war was to be avoided when there were other ways to achieve your goals
As a result Talleyrand supported Napoleon when it suited his cause and undermined him in other cases
Napoleon has suspicions but needed him too much and never had him arrested
During the congress of Vienna aiming at deciding sanctions against France after napoleonic period, Talleyrand managed to get the big players on his side so basically no sanction was decided in the end as Talleyrand thought if France was greatly sanctioned it would bring resentment and therefore more war (what happened with Versailles treaty after WW1 basically)
Thanks to this France and England never again went to war against each other even though they were mortal enemies up to this point
Since many of Talleyrand’s dealings involved corruption and or betrayal he generally has poor reputation but I think it is kind of undeserved as he fought for a great cause and worked tirelessly for peace and prosperity in Europe
He did betray Napoleon quite a bit but mainly because he would not listen to him and kept making dumb geopolitical choices, allying with the wrong people and making wars when diplomacy could happen
Really little known: Adolphe Thiers (sadly it does rime with the name of another famous Adolf)
He was a monarchist in the 1870s and tasked with establishing a new form of government, with others, right after the end of the franco-prussian war
However there was a debate about which king to pick
In the meantime, Thiers as président de la République and others worked on establishing a republic which was meant to be temporary, just until a King was picked
But no king could be picked because of trivial issues like which flags to use
And Thiers, even though it went against his original political convictions, found that the IIIème République worked so well that he worked to make it permanent
To this day la IIIème République was the longest and most stable democratic political regime of France
He also has the blood of the communards on his hands (from 6k to 30k depending on estimations), and was generally viewed as a tyrant
Some streets that had his name were changed because of it
He is kind of the villain in Napoleon’s story since he had a notable part in the fall of Napoleon towards the end by sabotaging peace talks with Russia (on which Napoleon had bet a lot on) so Napoleon had no other choice but attacking Russia and fail
As a result it is easy to just portray him as a traitorous prick
All he did though was for a greater good after he realized that as long as Napoleon was both in power and winning wars Europe would never know peace
I hijack your comment to recommend the book « Napoleon’s master: a life of prince Talleyrand » by David Lawday
It’s a real page turner and gives a lot of insights on the Napoleonic period and what happened behind the closed doors of the diplomatic world
A tyrant who established a functioning democratic regime against his own interests is a pretty good tyrant in my book
The Commune is very talked up and is one of those historical points that has become a kind of political myth but in practice it was a revolt and it was squashed and it is nothing extraordinary in the general history of the 19th century and considering the incredible instability of the time it took place in
let's agree to disagree then :)
Sure :)
Most cities have 'Asian' (ie westernized Chinese/Vietnamese) food, döners, Italian, Greek, Indian, Thai, Lebanese, Argentine, Japanese
Authentic Mexican food is more rare, but you can definitely find some in Paris (not in the other big cities I've lived in)
I mean you can find any authentic food in Paris really, I know of a Tibetan restaurant, an Afghan one etc
Checking out just-eat (delivery website) for my city :
Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Indian-Pakistanese, Asian, Tibetan, Brasilian, Thai, French, Turkish
Plenty of Tacos and Couscous and Burgers
They don't really say Mexican next to the Tacos though
Those are just deliveries though, there's also a Brasilian-Antillean close to me, for example
I wish we had good Indian and Mexican food in France
It's unfortunate we don't.
I love Georgian food as well and there is a delicious Georgian restaurant in Paris
Je pense donc je suis -> I think, therefore I am
Lots of famous lines from Molière's plays have wound up in other media on account of how well recognized they are (e.g. "Qu'allait il donc faire dans cette galère", from Scapin, or "Ma cassette
" from l'Avare)
"Un pour tous, tous pour un" shows up a lot in popular culture, generally associated with Dumas' Les Trois Mousquetaires (even though it's technically apocryphal)
Descartes's "Je pense, donc je suis" is a fan favorite as well
Edit : Almost forgot this one : "Sans la liberter de blâmer, il n'est point d'éloge flatteur" ("without the freedom to criticise, there is no flattering praise"), From Beaumarchais' Le Mariage de Figaro
It's the tagline of the right wing newspaper Le Figaro, and obviously where it gets its name
that English translation is confusing the hell out of me, and while I can usually kind of understand written Italian, I'm lost there too
"Cachez donc ce sein que je ne saurai voir"
A "Tartuffe" is synonymous to a hypocrite
Yeah, I think Descartes wrote it in Latin first, as it was still the language of science and philosophy at that time
RIP la chatte à dédé and RIP our chances of winning the european cup
It's pretty safe to assume we'll be beaten during the early stages, as it's a common occurence for those who won the World Cup just before
But I'm definitely rooting for Croatia, they were exceptional players and deserve a big win
So I hope they'll have a comfortable draw in 2020
As a french I'm really happy with the draw
It's awesome
You have the euro champion, the world champion, and Germany in the same group
Maybe also Iceland, that would be cool
We will have a rematch with Portugal, never played against them since that damn finale in 2016
As of Germany it's always a pleasure to play against them, we lost in 2014, they lost in 2016, let's see for that time
(And I also live in Germany, so I like it, I'll be wearing my french jersey and get into friendly fight with germans
And even from a sportive look at it, it is not bad
Anyway, we are aiming for the title, so it is not bad to have such intense games early on
Yeah, useless to say, but our group is quite the thing
The weird aspects of the draw have a lot more to do with the "multiple hosts" things than the admittedly complicated League of Nations qualifications process
Même les troisièmes peuvent se qualifier donc bon
Je ne dis pas qu'on va gagner, mais ça ne change pas grand chose à nos chances en réalité.
ahah I didn't cared much of Bale, but since he pulled that "Wales

Madrid
In that order

It's common in the next World Cup, not in the Euro following the World Cup
Germany 2016: Semi-finals
Spain 2012: Winner
Italy 2008: Quarter-finals
France 2000: Winner
Germany 1992: Finalist
Seum Courtois will be back
but you'll lose against France again
Well, you've proven that you don't need to win a game to get through the groups (and then go on to win the whole thing), so I wouldn't give up just yet
Ronaldo is a fine player, but he really shines most as a cheerleader obviously
Yes in french it's called "Esperluette" and it's one of the most beautiful word in our language
It's "Esperluette" in French (I can't believe I'm the first French person to comment
"esperluette "
I had to google it, never head before
I love this silly word
Beautiful but never heard it before
We learn everyday I guess
Im french too but never heard this
Always called it « et commercial » translating to « commercial and »
Tu dois être 4ème ou 5ème désolé de te casser le moral
Yes but the post is asking for the"proper" name
Well I thought that was the proper name
*Hey friend, wanna build an Alliance
Complaining
About work, food, strike, weather, people complaining
Sometimes I just want to scream shut up and enjoy !
Always complaining about everything
That's not solely italian
We have the same
I have fought my group of friends on this for the past 8 (9
) years, I'm *always* on time, I always told them how long I waited
I never got mad about this, just:  "Hey guys
" "How long did you wait ?" "25 minutes why ?"
They started to feel bad about it pretty damn quickly and after 2 to 6 years (depending on the person), they always are on time when I'm here
When I'm not expected it's still random time land, but hey
You would fit in perfectly in France
We have the same kind of people here sadly, the whole exceptionalism thing is quite upsetting because, like you said, it's stuck in the past, only wanting to revive a bygone era
And it doesn't really care about the future
Nowadays if I'm organising a dinner at 21h I just say to come at 20h.
We call it " quart d'heure Parisien (or Lyonnais)"
Or Angevin aha
We call that "quart d'heure de politesse" where I live (Brittany)
No, never ordered without onions though
The pet peeve of kebabists in France is that they all call everyone « chef » (chief)
It’s like it’s part of the job or something
I would be pretty embarrassed
Oh, you say "kebabist"? I say "kebabier", which could translate as "kebaber".
To answer OP's question, I always order them without onions because I hate them, and never, EVER did the kebaber ask me this
No I say kebabier in French
Same here, people find it funny because it sounds like a kebab tree but I like saying kebabier
Interestingly enough before 1789 Paris was not always the capital
Charlemagne lived in Soissons
The capital moved between Soissons, Orléans and Paris until Louis XVI moved the capital to his Versailles palace
But after the French revolution the capital remained Paris because of it's population, cultural and economical power
It is also situated in the Seine river, making it very good for trade
Well the capital moved to St Petersburg once
Why did the Soviets choose Moscow
You just forgot Vichy here: during WW2, it briefly was the capital of the collaborationist government
This is obviously a part of our history that we’re not found of
Paris became the capital agin in 1945
(Also, it is true that the capital moved until 1789, but Paris was an important city even before that
The Louvre was the residence of the king for quite some times, and Louis XIV chose to make Versailles his capital because of Paris -roughly
"Were you killed ?"
"Sadly yes
But I lived !"
"Je m en bats les couilles"  ~ i am slapping  my balls with it"
In French, the most common way of saying "I don't give a fuck" is "je m'en bats les couilles" (literally, "I beat my balls with it')
Young people will often shorten that to "balec" (written phonetically)
In French we say "J'en ai rien à foutre", which van literally translate to "I have nothing to cum over this". A more efficient translation would be "I won't cum over this"
Fuck yeah this is French
Also "je m'en branle" = "I'm wanking about it"
"J'en ai rien à péter", I can't even figure out how a literal translation would work, maybe another French person could help
Ça m'en touche une, sans faire bouger l'autre
"Je m'en tamponner le coquillard"
« (Je n’en ai) rien à battre/foutre/cirer/faire/branler
= I have nothing to beat/put/wax/do/wank this with
Maybe "I have nothing to fart about"
And "J'en ai rien à foutre" litteraly I have nothing to put but in a vulgar way (foutre is also a really vulgar way to say sperm)
If I recall correctly it was popularized by Chirac and made its way into popular use
Majority of french people didn't speak french before 1850
Half of the roundabout in the world are french (30 000)
Berrichon, Breton, and other regional languages
This wikipedia page is a bit more explicit : [  and this one : [
Well, yes of course
But if you see Belgium right now, everything is much more complicated and they have only 2 languages
Imagine having 20
It must have been very violent for all our grand-parents to live through that, but right now, it's easier for everyone

*La Horde du Contrevent
I think it's been translated in quite a few languages
I'll go with "La Peste" by Albert Camus, which is situational
Try The Count of Monte Cristo, or The Three Musketeers
If you want something on topic, read *La Peste* by Albert Camus
That's probably the best moment to read this book
I'd also say all the books by Jules Verne
And to be more modern, like "La horde", but mainstream, Bernard Werber
"Les fourmis" (The ants) and others should be accessible
Spain isn't massacring the Catalonian people in response, the situations aren't really similar
Interference from other countries is also used as an argument by China (Hong Kong/ Tibet) and Russia (Crimea) for example , so although it's quite possible, I'm not sure that it's a strong argument
In Belgium they apparently have to vote or be fined
The scramble for Russia then ?
We'll take Moscow
It's mostly people with English as a first language struggling to find when to use the formal you *Vous* or the informal you *Tu*.
It can sometimes be hard for us too, but mate you were holding me while I was puking in the gutter last night, you can stop talking to me like I'm some royalty now
For some reason many foreigners know the phrase *comme ci comme ça* (so-so)
It does exist but I don't know who says this in real life
American tourists in France, who admittedly want to be nice and that's a great thing, will tell a waiter, or cashier "ça va
", which means "how are you doing
". But it's kind of confusing, because waiters, or cashiers and whatnot don't expect that question
So they're like "uh, yes, good/ok". In the end, all they want to do is take your order, or sell you your ticket or whatever
Not answer your question about how they're feeling today
But admittedly that's a tricky one
Because in France, people who do know eachother will say "ça va
" when they cross paths
But it's a rhetorical question, it's a way of saying "hello". But only between people who know eachother
If a perfect stranger asks "ça va
" (aka "how are you doing
") it feels like a question that demands an answer
In reality, "ça va
" is the equivalent of "whaddup
" or something
It doesn't actually demand and true answer
And you wouldn't say it to someone you don't know, like a waiter, or supermarket cashier and whatnot
Hijacking your comment, sorry dude, but I'm always baffled at the *"comme ci, comme ça"*... who the fuck ever says that here ? :D
Land of the poets
Na probably from selten, which would translate to seldom
Yeah, people do say "ça va
" as a rhetorical question, and you're not supposed to answer that you have problems - it's just a synonym for "hello". But only between people who know eachother
You don't say "ça va" to some supermarket cashier, or hotel  receptionist
You say it to a friend, or coworker
I mean it's very informal
It's basically like saying "hey man, what's up
". You say this to your coworker, you don't say that to some cashier
True native
Often accompanied with a fart sound that you make with your mouth
***Prrrt*** "J'sais pas" *shrug*
We're a weird bunch
Ehh, it's more like "J'sais pas" ou "Chaipa" (really informal) but not "j'ai pas".
France is not too big on nicknames
It does exist, but it far from the norm
How does William transforms into Billy, How does the W sound changes to a B sound ???
Moreover, does'nt william come from Guillaume ( never understood that change too)
Agreed ... My name is Christophe but only foreign colleagues try to call me Chris
might be my personal experience but again in France (not in french) we can use diminutifs but de just don't as a norm
Could have been Jeff ... But it wasn't
I spent 3 years in Georgia, Tbilissi when i was a kid (my parents made us travel for work)
Moreover I did not go to a traditional georgian school but a school for foreigners
All that being said i keep a very good memory from there as the ppl were all so kind and welcoming
Truly the georgians are one of the most hospitable ppl
Geography wise, it is also an amazing place
The views are breath taking
Also since you are surrounded by the Caucasus, there are many mountains and ski stations
Finally from a financial stand point, i'd say the living costs are overall pretty cheap
If they leave Europe, they will give a free monopoly to another company and they will probably lose users after several years in others countries because there will be better alternatives
An important information to consider that explains Facebook stance: they don't know how to operate without data transfer out of the EU
Their product is not conceived for it
They won't be able to do so in any short delay (or even medium delay) as this would probably imply to rewrite big parts of Facebook and may be even an impossible task
Facebook is currently conceived as one big single worldwide social media
You can be in the US and comment a photo of your Italian cousin, and viceversa
This means data transfers (to make it simple)
So it's not bluff, the only choice left to Facebook with current regulator stance is: withdraw from Europe, as the alternatives are not viable (they can't ignore European justice and fines, and they can't rewrite from scratch Facebook)
That said: good riddance
The idea of a single company controling such a worldwide social media shouldn't have existed
Perhaps next time we'll design things from scratch with interoperable local infrastructures that form a worldwide décentralized network, where everybody controls its data
As much as I understand the sentiment, we have to realize entire companies will close down if this happens
Thousands of people's paycheks rely entirely on that
Collateral casualties wouldn't be small
Fine !
harhar how did it get 110k upvotes though
All the monopolies should leave so we can create our own networks
Please do
Never getting on it while everyone wondered why has been  a bit tough at some point, but I am glad I stuck to my ideals/principles
> But let's be honest, those are empty threats
They are not going to leave Europe
And if they do, how much lost revenue and jobs are we talking about
Can't be huge
Can't imagine Facebook feeling threatened over the likes of France or Germany only
I'm all in for Facebook paying up or fucking off
Facebook groups are just private subreddits
Change my mind
I think it's candid to think that 300M EU citizen matter less to them than 1 billion Indians (for example)
They do make more money on us than on the third world
Just because we buy more expansive stuff (hence more expensive adds)
But yeah ... I'll be happy to see them gone too
Just not gonna happen

Macron on the caricatures and freedom of expression
He really nailed that interview
Especially when the interviewer said that "french laïcité seems to be oversensitive of Islam", to which he replied "I feel like it's actually Islam that's oversensitive of our laïcité".
Too bad everything he said will fall into deaf ears, or be deformed to demonize him even further
The entire interview can be seen [here] for english speakers or full transcript [here
The whole interview on Al Jazeera is 1 hour long and it's incredible, it made me really proud of Macron
I think the only available English subtitles are the automated translation from Youtube:
One question comes at me
Why, in the name of a heavy weaponized penguin, do somebody has to explain that
Those words on liberty should be natural and obvious
For me, it looks like somebody explained why we shouldn't take a poo in the street
u/savethisvideo
He is a clean cut politician with good ideas on many matters
His ecological and economic views on the other hand, are the most debatable things in France
He is part of the establishment and works for them
That’s what bothering French people the most
Still better than most leaders but we do like to complain
Let's not get too arrogant about this
Just a reminder that 41 years ago, parts of the UK, Ireland, Norway and others banned "The Life of Brian" and the Monthy Pythons received death threat
It was not hundreds of years ago
I'd say like many French presidents, he's been disappointing on domestic issues, but has a good stature on international ones
Can't really imagine having a Trumpesque leader because we would never vote one in tbf
> French is actually a beautiful language
Do most people find french ugly or what
That's new to me
I always had the impression people thought of French and Italian as some of the more elegant languages out there
the thing is that Charlie Hebdo is not making fun of ur faith
It is making fun of Islamist leaders using Mahomet as a tool to force some brainless guys do bad things
If Charlie Hebdo was making fun of Muslims just because they are muslims, the newspaper would be long gone
Same syndrome with Chirac some years ago ;>
They’re not obvious in many countries
For some, there is only submission to a theocratic order
I think it’s because some Americans wish they could elect him as their president, they say that in the comments
Muslim media has been pretending he actively supports the caricatures, that he basically insulted Islam himself
But yeah, this might not change anything as they can keep mistranslating and lying to fan the flames
Reddit is a private company, it's not their duty nor their responsibility to maintain freedom of speech
Now, should social media be left entirely to private companies when its influence over society has become massive ? That's another question

Bro it got rid of Catholic church's political influence, we were "the church's eldest daughter" for centuries and centuries and decades after the republic is solidly established that's gone, you best believe French universalism and republicanism will find a way to keep this diverse country united
It is so entrenched in our constitution, laws and customs, it doesn't even need to defend itself
It's the foundation of modern French culture
They said French
You actually have videos of Macron speaking "daily French" which is funny to watch
He's not speaking Quenya or anything
This is how I would speak when making a business presentation (albeit probably not as eloquently)
He has shown that he doesn’t really understand the massive crisis that we are starting to face
&#x200B;
He is willing to shut down our oldest nuclear power plant, but doesn’t add any reactor instead, and the EPR in Flamanville is still not progressing much
Meanwhile, China has finished their EPR that they started a lot later
Less nuclear means more fossil fuels, so that meant coal power plants
In general, our nuclear sector is very competent, however it’s ruined by politicians who say « What you’re doing is very good » in private but « Nuclear is dangerous » in public
He could have dispelled a bit of the artificial fear that exists around nuclear power and never did anything about that
&#x200B;
He has spent milliards for show, like this plan to help people install photovoltaic panels : [
Instead of the 130 milliards this plan is estimated to cost, he could have spent 40 milliards on installing heat pumps in every apartment or house in France
A quarter of the cost, 10× more effective
&#x200B;
It’s not specific to him or LREM (his party), but they have shown how little they understand about climate and how not comitted they are to even read any IPCC report
Every one of the answer you’re getting are pretty spot on except for the one being the most upvoted
Gael Giraud, Jancovici, Bihouix and so on, are saying it all, but it’s in French so I don’t know if you’re gonna be able to listen to them
It's actually exactly this, it's the first sentence of the first article of our constitution :
"France is a Republic that is indivisible, laic, démocratic, and social
I completely agree, and I'm sadden by the fact we can't never find a common ground to help other EU countries
Our leader positions should be used support others, not to secure our head start
Yes let's make a deal : you let us deal with the external, diplomacy and military things only in exchange for some money

>Perhaps he can can help unite the Europeans to take collective action against extremism
That, I hope so
He was previously in the socialist govt, was candidate on a platform both center (his famous idiom was "and at the same time" referring to left and right views) and not ultra-politician (most of his completely new party came from civil workers), and was elected because his second-round opponent was far-right
But basically he's an ex-banker from Rothschild, has some progressive views on social issues but very neoliberalist views on economical issues, abolished the main tax on wealthy people, and hasn't delivered on most of his social platform
He has been demonstrated against by the Yellow Jackets since end 2018 and his popularity went from 55% to 24%. It's around 35% now, but his mishandling of Covid crisis (with many contradictory decisions and communications) is in everyone's head

Whining about downvotes is not a good look, do you want to have a discussion or are you just trying to get fake internet points ?
Try developing your opinion instead of a vague one-liner, and then you may be able to generate more intelligent discussion
I'd also recommend not using politically charged buzzwords like "freedom of speech" or "PC" because that will make a lot of people assume everything about you before they even try to understand what you're saying
People use the subjunctive in daily life all the time
> i think it is true that our language is the closest to latin from the major ones
It's really not
Italian's about as close to Latin as French is (in fact of all the major Romance languages Italian is closest to
French)
Romance languages in general have had a pretty equal rate of mutation in relation to Latin (that is they evolved in similar proportions)
Sardinian is morphologically closest to Latin
I understand, but how did that make you hate french
French used to be the lingua franca but people started using english more and more after WW2 , but french is far from useless
We just happen to be speaking english here because Reddit is an american platform, and that the internet evolved to be overwhelmingly english speaking, but that doesn't mean french is useless in the real world , far from it
Especially in your country, Switzerland
I HAD to learn english, in school , just as I HAD to learn spanish then german
I didn't have fun learning any of those three languages at first, but with time and effort, I started really enjoying them, it got me interested in learning about the respective cultures and media they're linked to
Same reason why I'm now learning japanese
I guess being curious about the countries of origin of the languages you're learning really helps you to have fun learning them
I don t know if it s a problem
People just need to not feed the troll
There's no « Germanic » influence in French, or rather not any more than in other Romance languages
The entirety of the « unique » features of French (which are really shared with all Gallo-Romance languages, up to Lombard, Friulan and so on) are down to the Gallic substrate and the tonal reduction that slowly crept in since the Middle Ages
Your anecdotal evidence is pointless
Statistical analysis of Romance languages show very little difference in terms of lexicon between French, Italian, Catalan etc
Spanish and Portuguese are more outlying
>french resembles a lot a kind of vulgar latin spoken by the franks
No, it doesn't. Unless by « Franks » you mean Gallo-Romans like what it meant historically, rather than Rhine delta Germanic tribes
>So it’s natural that minor the distance is, more the language is similar
That's not how languages work
Linguistic conservatism isn't a function of distance from the geographical origin of the language
In fact the opposite happens more often that not, with the cradle of the language being the area that's the most demographically/economically relevant, and as a result where the language mutates the fastest
That's why you've got rural English accents similar to 17th
century London ones, why Québeckers kept habits from urban 18th c. French, why the Southern Chinese dialects are closer to Middle Chinese than Northern ones, why all the most archaic Romance dialects and languages occur in mountains and islands
>Dante even called what he wrote “vulgar” and it is intelligible italian
It's the other way around
Dante didn't write in intelligible Italian, **Italian was standardized after Dante** (and Petrarch)
Sure, but then what's the point in learning foreign languages since english is the most "useful" one
We should abolish all of them except english with that reasoning
After Napoleon's invasion of Europe, the most useful language was French, same thing with Latin after the Roman empire, and yet people kept learning each other's languages
You as a swiss of all people should know how enriching multilingualism is
> No it wasn't.
>Lombardo is a dialect
A dialect of *what* ? Lombard is a language from a scientific perspective, and any romanist will stand by it
Its status in Italian law is **absolutely irrelevant**, especially considering how inconsistant that law is it is
Linguistically, what's a language and what's not is defined by [mutual intelligibility] that's it
Not what some law says, not what people think, not cultural conventions
That Italy rules them out as « dialects » for historical and political (read nationalist) reasons has no relation to anyone but Italians
"everyday Joes" in the vast majority of countries on earth still can't speak english
Only the more educated classes do
In that sense it's similar to where French stood in the 1800s although I concede to you that there were generally fewer educated people back then in proportion to the general population which mechanically makes english more widespread
>laws are irrilevant
In scientific matters, they absolutely are
You can't legislate truth into existence
>it’s the parliament we are talking about, a parliament that surely consulted linguistic experts for years to declare which is a dialect and which one is distintive enough to be a language
I hope you're being sarcastic
>And it’s a dialect of italian
It's not
It's it not up for debate or something that's nuanced enough that you could make an argument
Lombard isn't even in the same *branch* as Italian
What you're saying amounts to the same as saying French or Spanish are dialects of Italian
>it was too much influenced by standard italian and the other neighbouring dialects in the last millennium to be a language on its own
That's simply not how linguistics work
A language doesn't become a dialect of another simply by « influence », as worst it goes through creolisation
Which isn't even the case in that instance
If there was a millennium of neighbouring dialects influencing each other, then Lombard, Ligurian and Emilian would just have equalized to one Gallo-Italic language
And it would still be distinct from Italian
Any idea when it will be applied ?
Wasn'it already the case kind of tho ? Like other than Apple pretty much all smartphones such as Honor, One Plus, Huawei and Samsung had USB-C
So Apple will have to manufacture a different type of iPhone specifically to sell them in Europe legally
what do you mean the brick plug ? because some smartphone didn't had a USB-A at the tip of the cable ?

TIL how "nom composé" is said in english
That is going to be useful as i have one myself
Merci, mec
We don't have "middle" names in France, that would imply there can only be a firstname, a middle name and a surname
Rather, people can have several "firstnames", usually two or three, sometimes four
But as you said they're hardly used ever, I don't even know all my siblings' names
In the south it can be quite common for your family to exclusively call you by your middle name, almost like a nickname
The south of France
You're right, more like a firstname and two middle names
Yes
Intéressant, du coup la plupart des gens n'ont que deux prénoms ? Ou s'ils en ont plus, un est utilisé comme surnom ? Je suis vraiment surpris, quasiment tous les gens que je connais ont trois prénoms et les deux derniers ne sont jamais utilisés à part dans certains documents officiels
En tout cas je n'ai jamais entendu parler d'un "second prénom" similaire au middle name américain
Peut-être c'est plus commun dans les famille traditionelles, comme la mienne
Je connais plusieurs des gens qui utilise un 2ieme nom chez eau avec leurs familles

You're telling me this pandemic isn't an exceptional case
Also, do you realize that "healthcare staff" isn't exactly one entity, especially considering there are plenty of countries here
Nurse and doctor aren't paid the same and don't have the same level of expertise aswell
Caregiver aren't paid much because they don't have much of an expertise either
It's the same everywhere

So many fire experts on reddit
As a French it warms my heart to see it's important to so many people

The fire brigade chief did suggest that the entire thing collapsing was a possibility, which is probably what worried everybody

Perfect business as usual politics:
"Yes you've made a choice but since you are wrong we are going to argue about your choice for long enough that we can ask the question again
And again

Until you've made the choice you have to made

The good old "we didn't get the answers we wanted to so it must mean the question was wrong".
\> under the terms negotiated by Theresa May
The thing is, for that to be fair, you'd have to list out what those terms are
And even if you were able to list out what those terms are, you'd have to clearly list out what the impact of those terms would be on the average person
In addition you would have to list out potential risks
And you'd have to do all that in very simple layman's English and keep it all under a page long
THEN it might actually be a reasonable expectation of something the average person can vote on

Cherry on the cake would be our president (French speaking here) actually replying to this caricature by changing his Twitter pic for «  Majin Macron ».
Actually the most "shocking" thing about this cartoon is the tie with the fleur de lys (symbol of French royalty)
Still a thousand miles of what French cartoonists have done on him though
Thanks for the context, I was assuming this was coming from state owned Iranian media
He said, in essence, that freedom of speech was not negociable in our country, and caricaturing religious figures fell under that same freedom of speech
Of course, every holier-than-thou muslim started a cockfight to see who would act the most offended, and Erdogan, who dreams of becoming a 21st century Sultan, jumped on the occasion as well
It seems that it is easier for them to boycott and insult an european democracy over drawings, rather than a communist dictatorship locking your religion brethrens in concentration camps
I mean if there was no coronavirus debacle, it would be extremely funny him doing that
But with the current context he would be dead politically lol
That's what you believe
Uncanning specific answer
Rought moderating evening ? hang in there buddy

I mean I agree
it could be spun/used as a way to spill oil on the current fire

No, but making a joke while the country has to lockdown again would have been poorly received :)
It was a wordplay
Depends on the tie
A thin one will look like shit without a full windsor
Nothing does
Why is your first assumption that I buy shit ties ? There are plenty of great ties that happen to be have a thin flowing weave, even with seven folds or more
I prefer heavier patterned weaves that fit better with a half Windsor but I'd look like a clown wearing a narrow knot on thinner ties due to preferring slightly broader and wider collars
> A thin tie is a long thin width tie that's historically associated with a cheap shitty tie
I'm talking about the actual thickness of the tie, not the width
All my ties are pretty much between 8 and 9
5 cm

Praising cleaner vehicles is good and all, it makes Norway cleaner but the countries producing the cars get so much polution that we should wonder if it's worth it
Batteries need rare minerals, mined in poor countries using child labor and with no regards to the environment
The biggest mine in Chili that sells most of its minerals to car battery manufacturers uses 2000L of water per second
Minerals get harder and harder to find, and require more and more effort
Electric vehicules are not a viable solution at all
Producing those EV is very impactful for the environment
We shouldn't be so happy about countries going all in on electric
>We spend about 3,5 billion euros and rising per year
Scaled up to the EU that would be x100, or 350 billion euros
The costs are both exemption from the 25% VAT and from the other car-related taxes - so not direct subsidies so much as exemption from taxes
On thing that's important to keep in mind is that, because it is indirect, this "cost" depends as much on tax exemptions for electric cars as it does on the tax burden imposed on fossil fuel cars
So you can think of the switch to electric cars as having been motivated by subsidies, but also as having been motivated by tax increases
The first view gives the impression that the government is losing money, the second that the government is earning money
In France the core of the system is "subsidize cleaner vehicles with the taxes taken on more polluting vehicles". zero-sum

There are phenotypical similarities among the same ethnicity but that's not enough to speak of a "race" like you would distinguish a dalmatian from a chihuahua

This is absolutely frigthening
Maybe you saw the pictures of the ["Sea of Ice] in Chamonix, at the feet of the Mont Blanc which is ... [devastating]
It might snow this afternoon above 1300m. It's not even certain
I think I had the opportunity to witness the last time it snows in Toulouse, France
That was in 2018 and you could barely call it snow
This February was the hottest ever since they started measuring over here
No snow below 1600m of elevation in the northern french alps
I'm young but it's the first time I see this
In december istanbul was 20-25C... it was crazy, its normally 0-10 around then depending on the year
Had to watch a second time when I saw 20°C on my phone in Lyon the other day
It's melted "snow".
Weather isnt the same thing as Climate
Actually what you say makes it more worriesome
Climate change creates a complete imbalance of weather patterns, so areas where its usually hot can be cold and vice versa, its fucked

Macron is the new French president
Feast your eyes upon [our electoral map] !
He won not because he made a great campaign, but because he's not the FN
T_D learning about democracy:
Give me your salt T_D, told you Eurobros, we're not retarded yet !
Also, he won almost everywhere in France
Final results
Macron : 66,06% !
I, for one, welcome our new centrist overlord
The far right got more voices than 15 years ago
FN got 17
80 % in 2002, today it's 35%... It's worrying if nothing change
Proud to be french, and proud that Macron is our president
It will be a great 10 years
He played the Ode to Joy as he was walking from Louvre to the stage
Such a powerful image
FN got more voice than in 2002, its worrying
What ?
It's quite bad actually considering his opponent
You need to be careful with this number
And I say that while being someone who voted for him 2 weeks ago :
The numbers of people not voting are the bigger since 1968
The numbers of white fla
votes are the bigger ever
People clearly said they didn't wanted MLP as a leader, yes (and I'm really glad it's the case)
BUT lots of people also said, using these ways, that they don't really like the guy who won (most of my colleagues, and a good part of my friends feels that way)
do other countries not eat frog thighs
*blushes*
Mmmh he went from 0% to 65,8% in 12 months
His campaign was by far the best campaign out of all the candidates
He was France's preferred candidate by most reasonable metrics, like him or not
All of that is moot now, of course
He's got to deliver, period
I think THIS is too much asking :)
I doubt they're legit, however for a lot of people and abstentionists, this was a lesser of two evils, people saying it is 65% of people that are okay with Macron, no, it's 35% of abstentionists and null ballot, + more than half of Macron voters that voted for him against the FN
He'll have trouble finding a majority, and there will be uprising in the coming months and years from both far right and far left, if they continue the same kind of laws that they made the last 3 years, especially the laws Macron worked on were ones of the most heavily disputed by the people
I thought we were friends and that the enemies were the brits ? :(
I discover a new view of diplomacy and country awareness thanks to this thread lol
The left already got it's shit together, the true went to Mélenchon and the others to Macron, while Hamon stayed to fuck up the former
The thing is those bastards that are too prideful to leave the PS won't do it even though it's just keep using a dead corpse
But don't doubt it, behind the facades everything has changed
Chiche ?

If be happy to take the train around Europe rather than flying
But until they can offer international trips for €25 or so, I probably will end up flying
This is true
However, if you want this to happen, we need to change the way we finance the rail infrastructure, and this is going to cost billions
For now, building and maintaining rail infrastructure is supposedly paid by train tickets: there is a "toll" included in each ticket for that
If you really want trains to be cheap, the rail infrastructure needs to be paid by taxes, the same way our taxes pay road maintanance and safety
That's a consequent budget for our states
With an infrastructure free to use for any company, you can then open the market for long distance trains
For example, Easyjet should be able to span an Easytrain franchise and put trains wherever they want
They don't do for now because access to infrastructure is complicated and expensive
Like really expensive: to run a train on high speed tracks, especially in France, you have to pay around €30 of tolls per passenger to the infrastructure manager
And you need to reserve the track access up to two years before your train runs… It is sad but real: it's way easier and cheaper to have a plane flying from an airport than to put a private train on tracks
If you take out the track cost of train tickets, you'll have correctly priced tickets, basically
And if you have easy access to tracks, cheap private transport companies will switch from buses and planes to trains
You need also to consider that on top of this free track access for long distance, you'll want to subsidize some local regional trains as public service (the same way in your city, buses that run on free roads are also subsidized)
How about a simple, no exception, flat carbon tax that would effectively do the same
Transport of passengers is important
but train could and should be also far more to transport goods
The thumbnail looked familiar and indeed, this photo was taken 20km away from where I live
That and cancelled flights are not that common
Some train lines have such a bad record I'd rather travel by car
For example if you want to get a job in Marseille DO NOT SAY you'll come to work by train, for companies that means being late and even frequent no-shows
Hehe
I’m studying abroad in the US right now
Surprisingly, I wasn’t sent back home to France and instead told I had to remain here

Ah the dreaded aluminum foil blade guillotine
That's gonna be bloody
Every French household owns a ceremonial guillotine that we take out for big occasions: marriage, death of loved ones, big demonstrations
Belgium also have but mainly in the French speaking part
Not trying to be supportive of my own country, but the French aren't the only ones, basically the entire EU dig you
Even the Scottish do blame England for this so
I just married a Frenchman and now I fear my household may be incomplete
And sausage

> One of the first reforms in order is getting rid of the EC
How
That's the best tool, with the supreme court, that the GOP has to gain election
There is no consensus to remove it, senate might stay republican (or be dem by the thinniest margin), and they have more than enough state under control to block a constitutional amendement
Unless Biden announces a new constitution for the US (and it would be such an entertaining shitshow from here that is not worth the headache for the dems), nothing will change
I'm predicting that Biden won't be able to do any sweeping reform for the next 2 years at least
If he is still alive by then, either he will have avoided the feedback of Trump's economical policies (i.e. put the economy in overdrive, with an "Après moi le déluge" philosophy) and he might do some milquetoast reform, or he will be embroided in whatever crisis and will have no room to manoeuver
With how thin on the various front (Senate, house, EC) the victory was, he is condemned to a presidency of stagnation
That's at least how I feel it
I see this election as very similar to the one we had in France with Sarkozy and Hollande: Hollande only won because nobody could stand Sarkozy anymore, and after the election he turned into the least popular president in recent memory (reaching 4% approval rate at one point !)
I really wouldn't be surprised if something similar happened to Biden
Despite the number of people that see him as some sort of delivering angel from the evil of Trump, I haven't heard any coherent policy or vision from him during the two presidential debates besides "I'm not Trump".
Do you think that, should push comes to shove, they would stand for it, even if it means electing a Trump (since it seems like it's mostly democrat state that push for it)
Should it happen for one election, will it stand during the next one if it's more disputed
It's a tricky hack for a broken system

Fun war fact: Actually Italy waited for the very last moment to invade Southern France in Spring 1940 despite Hitler asking them to hurry the fuck up
When they did in June, the French Army was already in disarray in the North, and had only a token force of 60 000 reserve troops to defend the Alps, against more than 300 000 Italian troops
Still, the Italian failed and couldn't manage to capture more than a few villages in the mountains
I agree
It's clearly a hexagon
Source: I'm American
It's impossible to invade France from the Alps
That's why the Romans started from their ally in Marseille and first built a foothold in Provence

So in one way, they unconsciously protect the rainbow from the damages that the traffic could do
It’s vandalization, regardless of your beliefs
I've drove on rainbow roads before
They are full of banana peels and turtle shells
It is a traffic hazard
Not what I’m saying
You don’t get to vandalize public property to express your beliefs and people of all political stripes should understand that
You sir, don’t, which makes you a joke
I don't think so, to clean a rainbow you have to beat the crap up to the leprechaun at the beginning of it
I didn't know that old German dungeons had leprechauns ....

Kind of thought the whole idea of positive gender discrimination in recruitment was to promote women since to equal competences they were structurally disadvantaged from birth
Oh well, so long for Austria being progressive, I guess we're in the times of Kurz now
Don't write a memo about that if you work at Google
They just fear the backlash from SJW that could treat your company like shit on social medias and then you'd have ton of morons on the internet who could barely read a headline shitting all over your work
So they prefer to take the hit for a while of working with incompetent women instead of hiring the most qualified person for the job
By the way those are the people that claim that minority cannot be racist
Its a fucking disease
The woman you would hire would only have the persepctive of one individual, herself
Identity politics is stereotyping people according to leftists views about sex, race, age, sexual orientation
Stop doing it
What if the society is inherently unequal in that it favors men over women ? How do you make it more equal ?
Yes
That's the point of positive discrimination
There was a 0
25 difference in assessment and she was a woman, which means that she started at a disadvantage anyway, and anyone who is not a neckbearded basement dweller understands that there is no such thing as objective assessment of competences, and that it is especially meaningless in the face of structural discrimination
No need for hard work
I was born a white male in a well-off family in western Europe and despite being an average student I got a good, meaningful and interesting job
Never had to have a student job to make a living, and never suffered from material need
And I think that all of that is super unfair
It's positive if it can fix structural imbalance in societies driven by unequal values
The same way that positive sexism should fix the negative sexism that is inflicted upon women in our societies
Structurally inferior
Our patriarchal societies build them up to be lower achievers
They are told their whole life that they will never be as driven, strong and leading as men
You did address me about my grievance politics in the same sentence in which you said "Work harder"... Please use better grammar next time
And to equal class, a woman would be unfavorably affected
Discrimination on the opposite side negates the original social discrimination
In the end it's not about abstract theory of "discrimination" as an absolute concept, but its concrete effects in society, ie women are discriminated against professionally
I think that can be fixed further down the line, until we've fixed the early stages of discrimination
Alright, in exchange you'll try to read a book, and maybe think about everything that comes before a man and a woman are given grades
Just so you stop thinking that people come from a vacuum where everybody is given innate capacities on which to be judged, rather than from a society built on a specific culture that may favor men
Poland and Hungary
The "don't know" should be overwhelming higher
We cannot judge the quality of the political system of a country we don't live in
No, it's because you weren't the playground for two World Wars
Not intrinsically, no
Besides, not quite easy to make "better" comparisons when there's more than one axis of measurement

Good idea, right
Has the great advantage that Scotland gets straight into Europe without waiting in the queue behind all the other wannabes
No, that’s a common misconception
The Act of Union of 1707 merged the kingdoms of Scotland and England, which were until then separate, into one kingdom of Great Britain
In 1801, the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland were united into one kingdom of GB and Ireland, which then became the kingdom of GB and NI in 1922
Maybe England could declare its independence from the UK
That way it gets to leave the EU and Scotland gets to stay

Kind of oddly, I feel UK could keep going pretty well without EU

Everybody remembers the Bataclan massacre, but there were six attacks that night killing 130 people
21 were killed in La Belle équipe alone as they were just casually having a drink
The thing that will haunt me for a while, is that that entire day, I made a running gag of "Hey it's friday the 13th, something bad's gonna happen watch out". At the end of the day, my 13 year old ass was still so proud of his joke that when I went to bed, I still told my parent : "be careful, during the night you're gonna be unlucky, make sure you don't break a leg in the stairs
And then the next morning, my parents told me that in the night, over a hundred of people died in a terrorist attack
Meanwhile people are still denying that islam is an awful, dangerous, heavily sexist, warmonger and imperialist beliefs system, so such tragedies will still occurs

I remember hearing something was happening and I assumed it was “just” a hostage situation, not a mass murder
My friends were frantic looking for information about their colleague who was working there that night (unfortunately we learned he had been murdered) and I spent the evening scrolling through Twitter looking for any information about what might have happened to him
The stories coming out were so nauseating
Reading messages from people begging for help was too much
I still can’t get over the horror of it
Some of these muslims terrorist were literally born in France
Get you fucking pikachu meme out of here
Thanks for the support
Asshole
You've doomed us all
I don't blame common people, I blame the beliefs system
But you illustrate perfectly my point : we still can't criticize islam without people instant poping out of nowhere to call you a "hater" or a "persecutionner"
How is that racist to criticise a religion ? You guys are using words you don’t even understand the meaning despite the huge implications and consequences those words have
Btw USA are a country of communities while Europeans nations are countries of citizens, wich is probably why in your mind Islam = a whole race, but maybe you should consider that your point of view is pretty irrelevant when it comes to such topic in Europe
Jacques Brel ne serait pas d'accord :p
Parce qu'un Mohamed de la courneuve cité des 3000 qui vit reclut avec ses codes culturels familiaux est francais parce que sa mère a accouché à Paris ? Le droit du sol est une connerie sans nom
not all french are white, blond with blue eyes  whocall themselve pierre or jean-phillipe anymore
We are not in 1915 anymore
Our immigration began in The 50's not 2016
There is an important muslim communities in France and There are french muslim who become radicalized
Mohammed merah is The perfect exemple
Sadly yes
>Parce qu'un Mohamed de la courneuve cité des 3000 qui vit reclut avec ses codes culturels familiaux est francais parce que sa mère a accouché à Paris ?
Ouais
Il nait en France,a été élevé et grandit en France,  et à été dans une école française
est français
Être français c'est un concept
C'est une idée. C'est une culture et un mode de vie
C'est pas juste un papier
T'es pas obligé d'être blanc et t'appeler Martin pour être français
Mais vivre comme un saoudien c'est définitivement pas ce qui fait de toi un frouz
>And
You bring them in 50 from Algieria and other colonies, they barel y asimilate, now you have muslims from 2015
Great deal

Jesus you sound ignorant as fuck, by your POV all The immigrant are responsable for the action of like 5% of them
Show me how  the people who came from Congo, mali,algeria,morroco,ivory coast etc "barely assimilate"?
Get your nationalistic ass out of here and learn to respect gay people in your own country
Fucking dumbass
Edit: i swear this sub is becoming a nationalist echo chamber
Étant noir et français ce que tu dit est beau mais utopique car beaucoup vois les choses de façon différentes et ne partage pas cette
Pour beaucoup un  "vrai" français et un français "de souche". Blanc, catholique et descendre de parent français
Ces gens n'ont jamais rencontrés d'antillais
Des noirs parfois plus fiers d'être français que certains blancs
Fun times to be Turkish, I'm sad
inb4 we start building the Channel Bridge
>a 20 mile trip that will likely bring no real advances forward
You're shitting me, right ?
This is called a proof of concept: It's a concrete, physical proof that the technology for personal "jetpacks" basically works
If some inventor went to a company 15 years ago and told them he wanted fundings to mass-produce that kind of machine, he would be laughed at
If the same inventor tried it today, he could say "That guy did it".
Now we have a physical proof  that they work, and are reliable enough for long-ish (relatively speaking) trips, which means people will feel more confident funding them, which means they'll develop faster, which means they'll become more efficient, which also includes more eco-friendly
This represents all kinds of forward advances
We are all on strike on France the afternoons, enjoyinng doggy style with cheese and a glass of wine on the back of our partner
It's an all inclusive formula when you have a french passeport but sometimes you need to get the laissez passer A38 to have access to this formula
If you are surprised, you clearly have not travel much and tried to "mix" with the local population
The cultural differences regarding making love can be insane, even in Europe
Ah shit, my administrative phobia about the laissez-passer A38 prevented me to get those perks :(
I'm French and would like to point out that the bit about the glass of Ricard isn't entirely true, that would mostly be restricted to the southern parts of France
Frenchman here,
This is Paris
France
Montparnasse tower being the sore thumb as always
Napoleon was badass and wanted it to be known , that's pretty much the the story
Wouldn't that apply pretty much to the whole world, top10 most developed countries included ?
Norway = pp hard
Sweden = pp soft
Nice render
So tunisia is part of Europe now
Russia feel kinda sad
The Finn Line was thin
4 years ago today happened the Charlie Hebdo attack
It feel like it was so many years ago
But I think I'll never forget this week
I remember coming back from high school at noon and my mother told me that an attack happened in Paris
It was so unreal and I didn't realized what was really happening until maybe 2 hours ago when I received a lot of text messages from my friends and we were all watching the news to understand what happened and why
We were 16 yo and in a huge shock
Does't matter, as long as we have shitholes like Qatar, Saudia Arabia or Pakistan funding islamic fundamentalism, terrorists group will keep popping up
That's mostly an US problem though due to their conservatism evangelists
Or are you starting to feel too in the UK ?
This quote is often mistakenly attributed to Voltaire, but only because Evelyn Hall basically summarized Voltaire's thoughts with this sentence
No one creates new ones though
AGAIN
You wouldnt say the same if the nazi had rape your mother before hanging her with the guts of your father
You enjoy their gold and wait before we ask for your opinion
Oh you seems to be talking from experience
Did you play stupid game and won stupid prize too
And why is it of any importance
He painted on himself that background and paid for it
Freedom can go fuck itself as well as your slipery slope argument
so sad
Ok, you got me laughing at "Pirate Party".
Socialisme isn't far left it is center left often very liberal
Also communism
Christian party don't exist in every country see france, as does party with regionnal indepandance especially on a nationnal level
You can be liberal economicaly and not the socially
Those two front are often separate
Everything left of deep blue dots is socialism for some americans
Maybe I'm too generous
True
In France too we tend to put the orange part in the center
Yes, in France "une politique liberale" = right wing & free market
What would be called in english "libertarian" I think
A bit confusing
I know, it's just funny that it's there but has no seats
And I know some countries have a few
It's a joke
About France and Spain : just big cities and coast
Paris / Lyon / Grenoble / Marseille / Montpellier - Perpignan / Bordeaux / Rennes
What is the straight line at the bottom of Spain ? A railroad or a highway ?
It's amazing how you can still see WW1 western front impact on population density in eastern France !
You can clearly see where are the Alps
No scale
How can you fall for this
It's too long to even render as a link
without going as far and though individual houses are indeed too land intensive, you can achieve a lot of land footprint decrease by living in 3 floor flat blocks with a shared internal garden
Increasing the density does not require for everyone to live in 100 floors tower
Better take example on [Kowloon walled city] then
^^/s
Right, but "almost" without
Polish protocol be like : How many flags do we need ? "yes".

If I buy Internet in Romania and put a cable all the way to France, will it be faster and cheaper than my 40€ 5Mbps 0
6Mbps internet ?
I’m moving right now
It’s normal there
I thought you had one of the best in Europe
I guess, i will just keep my french connection then lol
Yes it's a complete rip off but my parents are too lazy to get fiber at the SAME FUCKING PRICE
Also my Internet is not at all representative of France's
Ah tiens c'est bizarre, je croyais avoir installé AdBlock /s
I don't know why, but in my district, only one ISP can provide fiber yet
But I have another one, in which fiber is not available for now, so if we wanted to have fiber, we would have to change ISP and the procedures to do so are fucked up
So in a way, I understand why they don't want to get fiber
(on top of some typical "we don't need it" and "i'm fine with that connection")
It's pretty easy to change ISPs in France now
Free will even take care of everything for you (lettre de résiliation, retour de box, etc
), all you have to do is call them
Congratulations my dear neighbour ! Cross the Rhine and come pay us a visit soon !
You might think it looks fine from above, in the sunset, with a clear sky, but it's usually smoggy, and when you're down in the streets it's mostly gray and sad, with a superb cathedral in the middle
Milan is probably one of the ugliest cities in Italy
This post was made by the genova gang
Best Wishes !
The Italian army also had inadequate and not enough equipment
Everyone seems to forget also the Spanish are the best painters in history
And I say that as a French
LOL This was on my mind when I saw the 2nd pic yesterday .
The left picture is actually a very accurate sculpture of the Habsbourg face
Thank god
Now we need to get the most people possible to realize how fucked up the law currently is
And can we please quit saying this is about memes
Nobody over 30 gives a shit about memes, and it's making the entire thing look like it's a bunch of 12 year olds fighting for really trivial crap, where as there's stuff that needs to be changed in this law which **ACTUALLY MATTERS**.
What a save
What a save
What a save
I love Europe
I want to know who in my country voted for it
How can I know that
Here, in a few days:
But you can already tell from the screenshot above that this was more or less supported from center-right to right
Strangely, it also seems like a sizeable chunk of the ~~far-left~~ left supported the directive in it's current state, and the far-right didn't (although a lot of Eurosceptic MEPs systematically vote against everything, so they may not be against this law because they think it's actually bad)
In what way such directive can be beneficial to the users ?
The people chose
Deal with it
Can we please stop making this directive only about "killing memes". It's so much worse than that
It was a manner of speech, but I get your point; message edited
Yes but after reddit heard about it, we hit an invisible wall where, because everything had been built on "memes will die", the message wasn't getting any traction outside of a very specific demographic
No it really doesn't. Why advocate for propaganda that is complete wank ?
Exept it has given insane visibility to the problem, don't pretend like there would be nearly as much people complaining about this directive if it wasn't for the "kill the meme" thing
I don't because it's against my interests
Completely
If you wanna know I wanna emigrate to England and live my life there
I just respect the people's will, especially as it was the majority
Except it's sabotaging the campaign against this, because nobody above the age of 30 gives a shit about memes, and for (most) people under the age of 30 it's pretty trivial, and definitely not worth putting in the effort to actually protest a law
There are other, better ways to simplify the message
Have you looked into their arguments _for_ the law
On reddit, where the vast majority is under 30 and is part of web culture
However if we want to actually fight against this law, we're gonna need to convince the public opinion and our MEPs with better arguments than memes
There's a difference between doing something out of the kindness of your heart and doing it because anything else is political suicide
Unexpected consequence: France and the Netherlands swap their flags
It looks that way, but it's consistent across all the flags
> There never was a unified Europe and never will be because there's no reason for it
There was always an Islamic empire and there will always be reasons for it to exist
And yet here we are, no Islamic union, a European one
> What reason would an Islamic Empire have to exist
In short, public opinion
Check this out (albeit it's about an arab nation rather than an Islamic one) :
"79% of respondents answered that Arab countries are one nation
44% said they are separated by artificial borders
57% support the federation of Arab states under 1 government
- There should be an Arab army to solve internal Arab problems
Yes: 70%
No: 20%"
Do you think we'd get figures even close to that if we did a survey about the EU ?
> But what's the argument for the EU
Independence from the US & Economic growth
I didn't say that the US tried anything or wasn't an ally
But not everyone or every country likes to rely so much on the US
On many aspects like data privacy or socialism, Europeans and US citizens differ
That being said, we rely more and more on the US technologically
We use Google, Amazon, YouTube etc
We have no European alternative for those
When we implemented our law for data privacy, it was enforced on Google thanks to the EU
No single country would have been able to do so alone
Without the EU, every country here would have been forced to do like the Americans
This is but an example of "independence from the US". And It was more about "maintaining their independence" than creating it
You could argue that this isn't important for poles and that US influence or German/french influence is the same
But it creates an alternative that is not China
That's all we want from the EU
A good alternative to the US so that we can negotiate with it or its companies, were the need to appear
France became the first team since Brazil in 2002 to win the tournament without the need for extra time or a penalty shootout during the knockout stages
French here, I love this meme :'D
Hope it lasts !
I'm so glad our flag has the ability to evolve everytime we win a WC
Can't wait for the next victory !
But
We were the OG tricolor
Viva La France Rouge
Vive La France Et Vive La République !
Allons enfants de la Cuisiiiine !
Good
As a Frenchie who lived in the Netherlands, I don't want us to win again in 2022
The Dutch, Croat, Japanese or Belgian teams will have my full support next Cup (if they qualify of course)
Your team has been amazing, you should be proud of them
You guys were great
I'm sorry for you guys
I and many others will never forget your Croat team
Croatia made a new fan today
Honestly the best final I have ever seen
I live in Paris and wanted France to win for the party
But I found myself rooting for Croatia in the end
trust me you don't wanna hear it for too long
([here] ) it is tho)
Salty
Both teams played very well but Croatia made few mistakes
What a World Cup
I don't think that's true
We don't have flags at home
I don't know why, but it feels weird to me to have a flag of my country
Thanks
It's true this week-end is a big one for us frenchies
get prepared for your mind to be destroyed
Pissing off the British with a simple, nice sentence ?
You don’t get more French than that
Friendships do be like that
Le frontières linguistiques du breton sont plus grandes qu'elles ne l'ont jamais été. Le breton est tranquillement en train de s'approprier les zones Gallo
Rennes et Nantes parlaient Gallo, pas Breton
Les panneaux en breton en Ille et vilaine sont un vilain non-sens
Most ferries to Ireland leave from Roscoff or Cherbourg
Seriously
With a kind of Napoleon as a guard
Is not as black and white now
Schooling in Breton has been allowed for a while (any kind of regional languages learning was forbidden in school until the 50s) It just hasn’t been a spoken and used language for a lot of people since the 40s. For many like me it is hard learning a language that was the mothertongue of your great-grandparents that you never knew, no matter the bilingual signs in the streets and the policy of the French gov today
To be fair most bretons don't even care about breton culture and language
For many it's a vain feeling of belonging they enjoy most , like say, Texans calling themselves proud cowboys  or something
It's a picture I can hear
exp(PERKELE)
I knew the look on her face [reminded me of something]
That what is happening when you abandon every control over your economy and have no choive at your industrial politic but to give it to a supra national entity vassalized to USA
I've always found that this sort of imagery is the most powerful anti-war symbol
They way it makes you relate with another human being who's been so deeply hurt in their flesh
Another victory for Seagulloraptor
Dutch squawking seagulls are the meanest in my experience
I swear from De Panne to Blankenberge they're blitzing toward sandwiches, waffles, ice creams, everything they can bring their beak to, I even saw one hopping on the beer case of some dudes, not even startled by nearby humans and take a shit on it
Surprisingly, I always found them way more mild mannered on the other side of the border, never saw that kind of incident from the ones in Dunkerque, Brittany or anywhere else for the record
Kibbeling is amazing
I remember eating some in Urk last summer
We took a little week-long trip to Flanders and the Netherlands as we wanted some change after being confined to France for months
We spent a few days in Amsterdam, went up to Friesland (Harlingen, Leeuwaarden) and came back south crossing Flevoland
Urk is a nice small town tbf, with an interesting history
Eh, it was a nice place to spend an afternoon
Yeah, I know
It is a nice place to visit, to spend the afternoon
But to live in, eh
Plus I know very well how conservative the city is
I can get behind pelting a fascist with tomato and eggs even if it's a bit of a waste, stones are a bit dangerous but okay, but COINS ?? Don't throw your money at the fascist he will take it as encouragement and it's a waste of your money
Throw useless things at him, like the Sun papers or Royal Wedding plates
I don't understand why people in the comments are acting like actual fascism is anything but a marginal extremist movement in Europe today; you'd think we're one election away from a Hitler 2
0 from listening to the people here
Guess moral outrage is one helluva drug
If it happened today, people online would be offended that he was attacked for his "opinions", and would scream "cancel culture" at everything and everyone they think lean left
I wonder what the reaction would be if someones posts "I'm fascist and proud to be" or smth among those lines in r/unpopularopinion
Well they couldn't beat them up through their screen, at least
There are many, August 23 is for slavery and November 11 is for ww1

The general guideline seems to be to just return home
Completely unnecessary to mention a country in this case

Really ? I have doubts
It's one of the things the US is laughed at, with constancy, along with obesity and patriotism
>Norwegian students in the US unaware that the healthcare there is shite
Unaware ? Healthcare is absolutely something you should know about when you're studying abroad
Besides it's not shite
It's unaffordable
As I said, earlier on this thread, the US healthcare is ridiculed all over
Constantly
It's really hard to stay unaware of it
Something i wondered while visiting an hospital in the US
Do they need to look like freaking hotels lobby ? I mean in europe hospitals look like hospitals
In the US it's like they bring in fancy interior designers or something
I mean sure it looks nice and everything but when your costs is already so high should you really buy designer chairs ? And i'm talking about smaller hospitals not super fancy ones
They shoudn't have mentioned it at all
Maybe
I prefer seeing the glass half full
This isn't about Reddit only
>What I mean is- nobody (in their right mind) would make fun of patriotism
You're right
Alas, a lot of people mix the two concepts, hence my comment
As for the rest, no need to apology
I agree with you
For the record, Olivier Berruyer, the owner of les-crises
fr is pretty much a Kremlin mouthpiece and a conspiracy aficionado
But, as a French man, I'd this is pretty accurate (for one thing, the source - IFOP, main poll institute in France - is credible), and while the communists had a very good image back in 1945, that went down as the exactions of the USSR regime became known
French Communist Party was very powerful after the war and they had an important impact on the conscious of people
They put in place propaganda around the « 75 000 fusiliers » (75 000 shoot) in order to give communist and URSS the good role
But they actually only 25 000 people shoot whatever their political opinions
Source:  (it’s in French)
That's the result of years and years of americanisation, hollywood did a great job, yes the us was a key factor in victory in europe BUT without russian front and manpower it would have been "complicated" the result should have been more like 45-45-10
Kinda funny kinda sad when you know that the US army killed more French civilians than German soldiers did
They did the american way: bomb everything
Probably shouldn't have been menacing invasion and nuclear warfare too
It's really hard for a French to have a positive felling about the Brits
Being named in that poll can be seen as a good gesture
haha
&#x200B;
After all, they are our best enemies
Thx for your opinion, but have you read the poll
Come and See is a brutal masterpiece and has aged very well (unlike many other "war movies")
Did it ever occur to you that those young people and the ones not so fond about Americans are not the same groups of people ?
You can’t expect to say something as general as « French people ... » without making a generality of something a lot more specific
When are you going to understand that Paris is not the whole of France
Paris is not the only French city
Well, it's fiction, not a documentary
With a minimum of understanding of the context of its production, I think it's clear that this falls into a Soviet trope
This is a contemporary art piece, right

That would be the logical way but it wouldn't fit with what they are used to think/say/write so it would be confusing to them
For a european expat everything in 64th would be way clearer
Or rather less confusing

Well same with Christmas and presents, the newest generation of parents isn't religious and still celebrates it, all of these became 'popular holidays' rather than religious ones
The Dutch are on average the tallest guys in the world IIRC
And rather thin on average

If this happened in Mexico you would have mexicans rolling everywhere, like the cactus balls in western movies !
Just somebody messed with the MMORPG controls regarding gravity
You got nothing
Yeah, and ?
Do you grasp the concept of «average» ?

Sweden and France are really depressing tbh ;-;
The Jamon industry has gotten out of hand
Jabugo is near Portugal anyway so it all makes sense
Someone explain Turkey to me then
This explanation makes total sense for Norway though
No, which is probably why they had to google a (very) basic question in English
Also all of the researches look made up by some *i'm very random* teenager
That's probably why Bulgaria is looking at "stop scratching my butt"
I'll bring the wine
It's as hot today in Northern France than in the Sahara

I'm dying over here, brothers
Just a little bit
It’s during those times that I am thankful to live on the Isle of Man with 19 degrees and sunshine
Of course we get 6 months of rainstorms a year but the summers make up for that at the moment

Yesterday I opened my windows when the temperature outside was the same as inside
The temperature was 31-32°C, and it was 23:00
Welcome to Bordeaux =_=.
Man, just stop shaving your balls
Are you the Gimp from Pulp fiction ?
Well, the internet keeps telling me There are Hot french Girls in your area
Maybe it's related

Well, at least your baby will have 8 or 9 months to enjoy life before their first heatwave
Autumn is the best
I keep drinking and being thirsty like 20 minutes later
God I hope it goes east towards the nordics
Sorry nordics, it's every man for himself
Well, historically, being born in spring was probably the best
I don't know if there is a real difference nowadays
This actually looks like a pretty bad example tbh
From that picture it looks more like a road on the outskirt of the city, which would be a pretty good place to park cars instead of in the city center
And what has the space been replaced with anyway ? Dirt and a fancier sidewalk ? Doesn't seem worth it
Get rid of cars get a bike, problem solved
Officially 3 now
New attack at Avignon, man tried to attack police men but was shot
Is 3 attack in less than a month a new work record
We have a right to blasphemy here in France, so allow me to say this:
I wipe my ass with the Quran
The more time passes, the more i find myself thinking we are laxist
We're too nice
Liberties are only worth it if you've got security
I'd rather have a pacified country, with strict rules (education, justice, police, immigration et cætera) than a dreamland slowly turning into a nightmare
We should enforce aggressively our values on our own soil
[The terrorist is a 21-year-old Tunisian who arrived in Europe via the Italian island of Lampedusa at the end of September, his name is Brahim Aouissaoui] (police sources)
Fuck this and this is only the first attack today, atleast there were no more dead (except for the attacker) in the others
Well I'm starting to think the lockdown announcement was not only for the COVID but to keep everyone inside against this type of attack ...
Again
When will this barbarity stop
Nooooo Not France Not France
There is another one in Lyon, an afghan tried an attack with a machete but was arrested before hurting anyone
I've spoken with muslims from the muslim world on reddit, some of them are so filled with hate it's disgusting, they say they openly hate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US and wish that we will pay for acts taken by already long dead persons
And there is no explanations possible, I've tried explaining that we are against salafists not muslims, they don't care they wish us dead
With such mentality I'm afraid that in the near future we shall have war, and entirely because of them
The future is bleak
Yes but I don't think it's limited to France
Any Western countries need to get this under control
Well
I should say any countries that want to keep their western values
By being silent and not fighting for your free speech is similar to losing it these days
Technically 4, some people tried to run over a cop and ram into the Israeli embassy in Paris
And 5 if you count the Turkish mob who attacked Armenians 2 days ago near Lyon
Edit : [Technically 6] a man was just killed by police after trying to shoot people and shouting Allah Akbar
One of the problem is financing this, people are in principle ok with more money going to education, justice, police, immigration et cætera, but speak of raising taxes and protest follow immediately
It appears that the majority of us is furious and want every possible drastic measures to be taken, including on immigration laws
Our fantastic and free country is dying because of foreign agents and a fifth column, it's terrifying how hateful those endoctrinated are
We have, since 2015, deployed massive ressources to find and eliminate terrorists before they can act, our governement revealed in september that one attack is defused each month but it's obviously not sufficient because salafism is supported by thousands here and millions in the muslim world
Our governement already said in september that the situation was very preoccupant, many laughed (if almost every attacks are defused before they are committed the population tends to think that the risk is over, it's not)
My opinion is that we are on a verge of an actual war in the next years
Too much insouciance blocked every actions that could have been taken before to prevent this situation to be taken
Now it's a more or less slow spiral situation toward 1990 Bosnia
Hopefully, people will start to understand that wanting to defend our values and culture shouldn't be called "racism". Something needs to be done or beheading people in Allah's name will become a trend
That's not the same as in 2015, people are starting to wake up
People are just sick of trying to accommodate the never-ending Islamic attention-whoring
It erodes the very rule of law that protects Muslims, but I doubt those guys cares
french people are angry and if they aren't they should be
There was the one next the the old Charlie Hebdo office
Ya it's Iraq I'm taking about civilised country
Until recently, when you dared talk about those issues, you were treated like a nazi
So, WW2 is to blame ?
I'm only half joking here
I agree so much with your reply
When you told it 5 years ago in France you were called "racist". Bunch of hypocrites
I already feel like i live in a dystopia
Is it too much to ask, that i want to be safe in my own country ?
It's not anger anymore
We live in this shit since 2015
I just look at the ways we do things in my country, and realize that you cannot accept all the zealots of the world without a strict assimilation policy (and even then, we should be filtering who gets in and who gets awarded the nationality way more than today)
We should reform our education, justice and police systems
We should manage islam more strictly
In short, we should reform a whole lot of our system
If not, it'll goes on
That's all
For what it's worth r/france has attracted a bunch of non-French people recently, so it's not fully representative of the usual group rn
Unfortunately yes, as there aren't any measure possible before putting people in concentration camps
I'm not saying that "muslims will take over", we're far from that
I just think there's something wrong with, you know, beheading people because they draw caricatures or teach what freedom of speech is, which are two things France stands up for
Ok, you're officially a moron, discussion closed
I think we should use another term
Putin-boys or something, because there are honest Russians here and non-russian putin fanboys as well
I feel a bit sorry for the Russians browsing reddit and being thrown into the same bag
I don't think Russia give a shit about the west say and the people who fired the missiles are certainly still there or in Syria
For a moment i thought French girl war dropping this head in front of UK

Not a good argument since colonies like Syracuse and Rhegion were amongst the first wave (~750BC), while Byzantion and Chalcedon are probably in this map since they include the Bosphore, and both are from the second wave (~675BC)

The white-red-white flag is prettier and easier to draw
Plus it is a symbol of independence
The actual flag on the other hand, as the comic shows, is just the old flag without the hammer and sickle
It is a reminder of soviet times
Yeah, it's just a little joke, but damn the art is gorgeous
It reminds me a bit of Hetalia
In 1995, yes, the Belarusians prefered a flag that reminded them of the Soviet times which where, in their heads, better
But the meaining of symbols change overtime
1995 was 25 years ago
An entire generation only knew Lukashenka, the corruption and the repression of its regime
The current flag is in their eyes the symbol of that
And the red-white-red is a symbol of independence from this post-soviet stagnation

These fucking bullies will soon put this blame on Greta Thunberg, although they are the bullies I guarantee !
It’s the parents’ fault
EDIT: According to the downvotes, parents exposing their kid to the public arena is totally unrelated to that
Parents are supposed to protect their children
That is their responsibility (legal responsibility)
You are an adult at 18 for a reason, before that, your parents know better than you and your ambitions
This would have never happened if the parents had put their foot down
>Her parents did what good parents do, they are supportive of their kids even if bullies are against her family
Man, I'm sorry, but this sentence is stupid
If my kid's ambition is to expose himself to the world, be it for a good cause, then it's my duty to stop him
It's not like we had PLENTY of child celebrity turning in a disaster
> If a parent locks their kids into basement in order to protect them, that's child abuse
Okay
> So if your kid is is becoming a world class athlete
That's totally different, that's a job
If my kid is good at a job of course I'm gonna support him
That's not the case here
> Her parents cannot be there to protect her for the rest of her life
They have to prepare her to the real world
True, they stop at 18
Yes, parents are supposed to prepare them, not thrown them in the pit
Greta's parents have not prepared her, they pushed her face forward to the Congress, the Douma etc
I don't consider being a politician a normal job
I'm surprised anyone does
> She threw and pushed herself and forced her parents
And how does that stops her parents for stopping her ????
I want to feel those good waves too !

Weirdly I'm pretty sure someone with a French flag would not have the same reaction at all
I saw someone having beer bottles thrown at his window because he put a French flag at his window in Brussels (it was when both countries qualified for the semi finals so even before we eliminated them)

No they have to watch on you guys
You do realise keeping your nuclear plants would have reduced your gas imports and coal production while at the same time allowing you to use those idle fossil fuels plants for winter ?
Right now, [only 15 GW of your 120 installed GW of wind and solar are producing] and it's higher than yesterday
So coal and gas are 50% of your production
If you want a poster child for an unstable electricity system, look at Denmark
You're also emitting 5 times more than France today, which is ironic considering this nuclear/renewables switch was supposed to be climate friendly
Waste from nuclear plants isn't a real technical problem and it has never hurt anyone, it's a political problem
Nuclear waste in incredibly limited and is stored easily, that's why countries have been able to store it on site for 40 years
We know what to do with it, we can even reuse it in new reactors, but pseudo-environmentalists block every long term storage project so they can say we have no solution for waste
Thanks for the reply, it's very instructive
I agree all energies have drawbacks, I don't believe nuclear has more drawbacks than solar and wind though, since they must be accompanied by other back-ups, which is just adding problems on top of each other
Other renewables don't have as many drawbacks, including the hydro you mentioned, even though they're problematic for the local ecosystem and accidents can truly be catastrophic
>Question Energy Politics without seemingly no knowledge about it is the Problem
The Nuclear exit was questionably done, but it not connected to the Coal exit
Nuclear would also not magically solve all Problems
I agree but the problem is that, as a result, Germany is blocking or at least preventing nuclear development in Europe
Rules about "green investments", indicators about "clean energy" all have anti-nuclear bias
I would never claim nuclear will solve all our problems, even with massive investments, it can't be scaled enough to replace fossil fuels 1 to 1
Solar and wind would be even worse but none of them could replace the sheer amount of fossil fuels we use
I just think it's criminal to turn our back on the largest carbon energy we have for the wrong reasons
Nuclear is a long term endeavor, leaving it is generally permanent
>Who needed to be taken off the European Electric grid Denmark or France
It's France
And the issue with severe weather condition and the French electricity is nothing new
Who has the smallest amount time of Blackouts in Europe
It's Denmark
What ? I'm pretty sure France was disconnected to stabilize the grid, it wasn't the source of the problem
And of course Denmark doesn't have black-outs, it's massively interconnected and they have German coal and Norway hydro
If France needed to import 50% of its electricity randomly like Denmark does, the European grid would explode everyday
I forgot about this, yes this is a massive problem
But it shouldn't prevent you from storing future waste in a responsible manner
Was it in Eastern Germany ?
As far as I know, other European countries didn't have this problem but are still block from storing nuclear waste
>That's not a strong argument since only 1-2% of the total time that it could cause damage has passed
So are we gonna stop doing X rays too because they produce radioactive waste for centuries ?
> They block it because there's no one to hold accountable when it goes wrong
So it isn't a solution - it's just an excuse to shove away to responsibility to future generations
There are no future generations if we don't tackle climate change and quickly reduce emissions
Having a minuscule radioactive waste is a made up problem
Do you think buried nuclear waste will jump back on us ? I'm not even mentioning the fact that nuclear could be recycled in future gen plants, it has already been done in France for decades but it's not economically viable when you can just store it at the plant
I’m collecting pictures like this

> But if we all agree with the convention, than technically it is not a medieval house
Tell me if my reasoning seems wrong to you
I understand your reasoning, but from another point of view, this house being built at the very start of the renaissance means that it is much more representative and inspired by medieval style and methods than by renaissance
thus it could be said that this is firmly a medieval building
really an historian of architecture is necessary to tell us if this is representative of late medieval building, early renaissance or something transitory

>Now his work maintains practicality and beauty all these years, Ildefons Cerdà's philosophy and legacy lives on
That's just a very romantized description of someone whose never lived in Barcelona
Talking about the beauty of the architecture of a city that is covered in filth, sand and dirt all the time
All of this brought by the near by sea wind that where nothing blocks it
The beauty of a streets that looks all the same, full of concrete
Yeah, Barcelona looks cool from 400 meters high photo
That's it
On a side note, the old town of Barcelona is a beauty
I lived in it and I would completely disagree with you
If you walk by parallel and don't feel the straight street then there is something wrong with you
You are working under the assumption that the student knew how to draw the Finnish flag
We don't know that
Furthermore, even assuming the student intentionally lost a point here, your claim that it is "not worth it" implies that you think humour has little or no value
Many students disagree with this worldview and think losing a point in a test in order to make a joke is totally worth it
Where is that question coming from
Latin languages do as well
It's just that "polis" in this particular word comes from Greek, and there it means "city".

> French cuisine isn’t nearly as popular as Italian cuisine worldwide
&#x200B;
Citation needed
again the germans starting a world war, good job !
> French cousine was literally the start of modern day gastronomics while Italian is more of a simpler and more basic approach
Elevating cooking to a technical and artistic performance is very much an Italian invention
It comes from the Italian court culture, which set the tone for the aristocracy in the 16th century
But the entire restaurant culture and putting the chef in the center of the show is indeed a 19th century French innovation
At least it's not French Beer
Ok I don't like your pastéis de nata anymore
Yes , exactly, that was my point when I see OP was Canadian
Their statement is 100% true if you're from NA where the ialian immigration was huge
Rest of the world not so much
You're not wrong
I am French but the cuisine i really like the most is the middle east cuisine, especially Lebanese
I love lemon, the fresh herbs, the spices etc
that being said I do think French cuisine is the most technical, the most codified  and the richest, but, I don't think it has to be your favorite if that makes sense ? Like you might say bebop jazz and cloassical are amazing but what you really enjoy is hungaruan oy punk ?
I would argue that it was still bigger than french immigration pretty much everywhere
pastas are chinese
IF you look at cities like New orleans despite the French heritage they claim you need to keep in mind that food or architecture are very heavily influenced by the Spanish more than the French
I spent quite some time in NOLA and I love cajun food but it has nothing in common with French food
For Quebec you have to keep in mind as well that French cuisine became what it is in the 19th century, so quite a biot after the biggest emmigration waves
Hum
You're
arguing about pastas my dude
Deal
But at what cost
I am more pessimistic on the consequences of that deal
It is bound to increase the already existing divide between the "frugal" countries and the "spender" countries of the Union

Shit agreement with shit conditions, it's a scam
Wait
You mean they came to term with that bullshit that was austerity

The Austerity isn't here to rebuild, it's here to stop the bleeding
The Enterprises/people are the one rebuilding
The blood loss in this metaphor is money
Trying to spend less money isn't extra blood loss
You can be against austerity if you want, but stop misrepresenting it
No, it's not extra spending, and no, it's not meant to rebuild stuff
Tbh, what did you expect from this sub ?
Thousands gather in Paris to protest against muslim terrorism
So you should expect terrorism ?

That's interesting

It's regrettable, but it's the same everywhere
[Even a conservative government in the UK doesn't do anything
What does this have to do with it
Please tell us u/AmeliaTheRuiner, how many people are protesting today in France ?
Surely you must know, given your post
You know the protest was against police brutality and discrimination in law enforcement, right
Why protests against racism and state sanctioned violence against civilians bother you
Thank you brother, I wish we had more Polish immigrants in France, though I don't blame you for wanting to stay in your country

>when you have never said once Christian terrorism or Jewish terrorism or Sikh terrorism etc
Please, remind me of the last time a Frenchman died from a Christian, Jewish, or Sikh terrorist attack
Sure
However, would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
Thanks
It is terrorism committed by muslims, in the name of their religion
Exactly
I still don't enjoy the content of charlie Hebdo but guess what ?I don't care at all
They're not even being "offensive" they just state their opinion and if people don't like it they can simply ignore it because it's wrong for them
If anything it helps to create debates and discussion
Like seriously what the fuck is wrong with these people ?
I HATED last season of Games of Thrones, may be i should start planning of killing the producers because i didn't like it ?
At the end of the day, it's their show and they decided to make it like this, i still hate it but that's how it is, it's not the end of the world
I get my exemple is not the same because faith is another story
(and imo, that's even worse because faith is a lot more personnal, no one should ever be forced into the faith of someone else)
I can't, i really CAN'T understand the reasoning behind these attacks and that's why i believe at some point, even some tolerants people will be really fed up and simply want some quick and destructives measures to deal with them
It's scary
Please elaborate on the logical connection between George Floyd's death, Samuel Paty's decapitation, protests and people's order of priorities
Correct me if I'm wrong, but that is a murder [and it is the qualification that was given by the Paris Criminal Court (Cour d'assises)
>28th October
Yeah, there wasn't a single dead
I'll ask again:
would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
that's the issue currently in France
I'm extremely uncomfortable with the growing general hate and racism towards our north african or muslim countrymen, but i'm also very angry at the fact that some of them (and also some Christians tbh) don't want to understand that their religious law or beliefs aren't above the country's law, and that if they're offended at sth, well they can suck it up, maybe fill a lawsuit or curse these people to hell, but in no way it is okay to start harassing, sending death threats or killing people over this
(last year a girl or a boy insulted Muslims I think, and while it was fucking dimb from her, in no way was it acceptable to cyberbully her and send death threats, dumb ppl deserve indifference)
Do you have a source on how many people are protesting in France today, please
To my knowledge, that is false, though
The trial didn't conclude to any form of "plot", there was an altercation near the Seine, and during the brawl Brahim Bouarram fell into the river
There were tens of witnesses, even anti-fascist ones
Again, if you have evidence of a "plot", please share it
I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong
You are deflecting quite a lot
Let me ask my question again:
would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
You have just proved my point, it was a murder that started with a brawl
That isn't terrorism
My question really is extremely simple, here I'll help you:
Now, would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
Well, yes, because those are the facts, as you shared them yourself
Fair enough
But as a Frenchman, what I have experienced is the hundreds of deaths from muslim terrorism
Your points are valid, but you can't expect for them to have the same level of priority with me
On the one hand, you have harassment
On the other, you have decapitations, hundreds of people shot down, people run over by trucks at the beach
I'm sorry man, I understand what you're saying but you fail to see that muslim terrorism has been a particularly and uniquely gruesome type of violence that has struck my country for the past five years
Far-right violence is a problem, for sure
But it hasn't caused a single death
For me, the priority is clear, it is dealing with muslim terrorism

Oh you mean sending humans in space
I am no specialist, but I think it was considered too expensive and the French space agency concentratd on missiles and satellites in the late 60s.
In French you can also use Hebrew, Latin and Greek, but yes Chinese is probably the most used form
France also may use "c'est de l'hébreu" It's Hebrew to me, even though "c'est du chinois" is way more popular
Well, It might come from the fact that for many years French were making no effort to learn anything than French
We made French the official language of many things like the Olympics
Inland, most of Frenchmen were not educated to learn foreign languages until some decades ago
My parents learnt a bit of English and German, but would not be able to have a conversation or listen to a movie in English; and for my grand parents, only one knows English because of his job
Ask someone from UK trying to export to Europe goods, they are dealing with French customs barely speaking English for paperwork,it's a nightmare

Well if it's *your* ideas then you're the copyright owner so no need to panic
That won't be affcted
And as per the EU Parliament's press release :
> * Some uploaded material, such as memes or GIFs, now specifically excluded from directive
> * Hyperlinks to news articles, accompanied by “individual words or very short extracts”, can be shared freely
To be fair, I doubt there is one MEP that never selled out on any matter
Plus wouldn't people who have voted against the directive also sold out ? Just to other companies
I'm sure the Internet giants were on the other side of this lobbying battle
Shit what did we do
> it would not surprise me if the use a geo-block (then VPN will be needed)
Like geoblock all the EU ? Come on, don't be ridiculous, they like their money, no company will exit the entire EU market
You forgot the one alone bottom right
We have this every winter in Quebec, with wind it goes below -40°C and it is frigging cold
Kids still go to school, people go to work with their cars, etc
Life goes on
That's barely hot by summer standard
I'd take -40°C over +40°C any day of the week
At some point there's nothing you can do about the heat, while you can decently isolate and fight the cold
To be fair, I love mayonnaise and mustard but I wouldn't buy these cheap brands either
Nothing better than a good homemade mayonnaise or a great quality Dijon mustard
I don't like Ketchup though
I’ve stopped believing Italian food standards are so high when I noticed than in a horrifyingly high proportion of pizzeria they have pizza with French fries as toppings
okay I’ll give you that: it’s for tourists, and most of the time they are called « Americana »... telling
They have their place
That place is called the trash can
Except mayo
You can make a banging chocolate cake with mayo
And mustard, for sandwiches

They gave the germans access to steel that they desperately needed, without which rearmament would've probably been a lot more difficult

I saw that another person answered your question and I just decided to add my grain of salt
It's just that very often people tend to forget that neutral countries aren't usually 100% "neutral" and mention the resistance but not the other side of the coin

Granted most of it is probably mostly due to the media treatment of brexit; but it still looks pathetic and
Honestly completly pointless
Because despite following brexit from the start and being very close to a few brits myself, I still can't tell what all that was for
Honestly, everyone deserves to live in a free democracy
It's an interesting point of view
Why don't you think it's possible
Do you think that it's possible to "save" new democracies with education
dw we are beating records in France too
It is everywhere in France, and actually pretty much respected
Summer ended
Could be a weather factor
Meh
It is in grocery stores but not really outside even when there is a big density of people
Drove past restaurants yesterday and it was pretty packed with people not wearing masks
Maybe that's because you're a penguin and you don't have any permanent population on your island
What is the actual number in Sweden
The one Google says seems too low (just over 100k)
That's because you can't wear a mask when you're eating
yeah so ? Eating doesn't make you less likely to catch a virus
Maybe don't go stuff your face and cram yourself in a restaurant when there is a deadly pandemic going on ?
Is your government still convinced herd immunity is the way
I mean, you'll need much more aggressive numbers to achieve that
At this point prolly just turn around try to do the opposite
Given the culture, I think Sweden would actually be good at containing it
> The point is that the problem isn't that people at the restaurant aren't wearing masks, it's that people are at restaurants at all
It wouldn't make sense to be at the restaurant with a mask always on
Restaurant owners were supposed to distance people more
They did at first but from what i've seen it's no longer the case
Thank you
I find this believable
It's never too late to come out officially and clearly to state the right thing
That's exactly what I'm saying
Spain does not want herd immunity but it effortlessly achieved greater number than Sweden's, largely because of culture
If your government asks for lockdown many people will comply and you will do well at containing this
The only people that want to stop brexit now are brits, other countries are sick of their sh*t
It's smaller than I thought
With most of the population living on the eastern coast that must be quite densely packed
You can take it both ways
Japan is about the same area as the UK or Italy, that's not a lot
Then I assume it's the first time you heard "pays-bas" for netherlands too

My favorite: the isthmus has great bicycling trails that can take you through the forests or along the beach, to and from the "biggest" cities
Rental was easy
From the rest of the tourist info I have, a lot of the smaller interesting places were dotted around here and there and would have required a car or much longer bike ride to get to
Not an issue

Frenchman here
Macron wins
I hope Le Pen now crawls back into the hole she came from
Shame on you Trump supporters for trying to influence our election
So, I did my duty
Participation in my 'vote office' at 4pm FR was 65
5%. That is rather good
We go vote, but if Le Pen is under 35%, you should make French the other official language of /r/Europe
HON HON HON !
You convinced me to vote
I voted for MLP
VOTED, not my first choice but better than the alternative
I hope and wish that Europeans and others make a toast/have a drink tonight, when the victor is announced
I'm gonna go vote now
It seems for now, that there is going to be the same turnout as two weeks ago, which is good
The Presidential Election is the moment where french people feel the most empowered, the only time their opinion really matters
*Bonne Journée*
Frog here, coucou
Yes we know here that this is a huge day for France and a huge day for Europe
This election has been an intense time and with the American election it seems that the whole world has been caught up in the drama since early 2016
We've been on a roller coaster for almost a year now and today is the day where it will all end for some time, at least for me
We have a candidate here who has the potential to destroy France which is already in a fragile state
With our massive youth unemployment, terrorist attacks, riots and civil unrest, many of us here in France have felt a heaviness in our society
Today could be the day where it all ends and like you said, this is the day that Europe needs all French people to get out and vote to ensure that that one monster does not become president
So today I will be doing my part to ensure the survival of my beautiful country by going out and voting for Marine Le Pen
Thank you so much for the reminder
Does OP expect more people to vote after this kind of post
Do journalists think the same with their "Dear American people
" blablabla ?

Belgian media now say Macron is above 60% (exit polls)
8:30/9:00 pm local time
> Actually with our dumb system many people were already voting for their second choice in the first round
Which is why I think polls are a threat to democracy in this country
You should vote for the candidate that fits your view not for a candidate solely because he is most likely to win
Seriously almost **half** of Macron's votes were "useful votes", that's depressing
Oh, you
> After all, you're the birthplace of equality
The same way you are the land of freedom
Wait ... oh ...
I'm glad you came from the future to tell us how the Macron presidency went
Do you realize my post was meant to be sarcastic
Who the hell makes up his mind after reading a random post on reddit
Your argument is weak by the way
Not only my subs do not necessarily reflect my views (I've been posting on r/france, heavily left-wing) but a consistent conservative wouldn't vote for either one (I voted Fillon 1st round for ex)
Nevrmind, I was just being french about it :)
It was supposed to be her election
Everything lined up for her : 20 years of immobilism and the momentum from Brexit and Trump's election
And it didn't happen

She had her chance and blew it

This sub is more filled by Americans supporting Trump that actual Le Pen supporters

I've yet to see a thread about roads the Dutch don't use as an opportunity to fiddle with themselves
I’m convinced every european avoid 1 certain street in their city because the road is garbage
Mine is called Georges Varlet Street, Lucé, France
I guess Montreal is living up to his european influence
Roads are just in a awful state
Dunno I had a trip in Piedmont and Lombardy a few years ago and the road were pretty good even in rather isolated mountainous places
Well, the previous post was mentioning the Swiss border, AFAIK the border is not next to the Mezzogiorno :)

[Meh, Macron kinda blew it when he also praised Petain, hero of WW1 but puppet of nazi during occupation
I am already not very fond of honoring the generals of the first world war, since they are greatly responsible for the [nonsensical] [meat-grinder strategies] [of trench war] that killed thousands to gain a few meters, but from all of them, is it really judicious, in a time of rising xenophobia and nationalism, to honor the guy who also actively participated to the [genocide of french jewish people] ?

If there is one thing were I trust everyone of my presidents, it's the food and drinks
I'll never taste your coffee Finland, I don't trust it no more
Macron is the best
So proud of him
That'd be nice, it'd give him one less occasion to insult us from another country
I mean, I would support that
They aren't many country where it's easy to find good coffee, that would be neat
Still as long as such regulations aren't existing, I'll never drink any in Finland, if what they serves to the president made him react like that, I don't wanna know what they'd give me "random French dude n°5739". *Shivers*
The 300 French nukes are flying towards Finland, Macron explain "We can't let that go, if their coffee has this taste what else could they do ?"
Funnily enough, these days Italian espresso is considered very over-roasted and over-rated, and in the specialty coffee arena Nordic lightly roasted coffee reigns supreme, especially from Norway and Sweden
NEIN, I'll defend Italy on this one !
If there is one thing were you can trust French president it's food and drink, this face, it's a face that just saw the void, not one delighted by the pleasure of a good coffee !
Russian flair checks out
[Relevant song]
[Is this what you call coffee in Finland
Shit we have an anthem
Coffee is espresso, period
Everything else is merely a coffee-based beverage
That wasn't my original plan, but sign me on !

It's made by architects for architects
It would've been lame AF if it was a conventionally good looking building
Also a lot of people really struggle with old x new combinations
The renovation of Le Louvre with the pyramid generated a HUGE backlash at first and now it's one of Paris' most iconic buildings loved by the majority of people
Personally I'd take a bold project over a "good looking" one any day
One will always stand out and one will be completely forgotten in about 10 years
The first one is great for both publicity and the identity of the building as an art piece
The second one is good for short term public opinion

Well I guess the Ottomans were used to getting trash-talked by their european friends already :

Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons
We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee

The treaty of versailles being unfair is typical /r/badhistory material
/r/askhistorians has many threads where actual historians explain that the treaty of Versailles left france worst off against germany
It is easy to understand actually : if thz treaty of Versailles was so crippling, how germany did manage to become so strong by 1939 ? The answer is simple : it wasn't really that harsh
Also, it didn't cost the hyperinflation of the 20s, the weimar republic triggered actually the hyperinflation in a political play to escape paying reparations altogether
edit : added sources :

Unless someone hacked her devices to get those pictures, I say they're fair game

France has had a FULL NUCLEAR policy for decades, it's rather interesting
Well aren't you basically swapping nuclear for (other) renewables and letting coal be (mostly)
Its more because of the fact that they are a small island and less because of them not wanting to
Look at Malta
Same geographical challenges, same energy graph
And I wish we would keep it for a while longer
How did you guys vote for the europpean elections ?
I know, right ? I'm very "Green" politically, but we shouldn't consider nuclear energy an enemy
We need to get rid of the rest of our fossile fuel consumption, fix our god awful Power Plants and then slowly switch that Nuclear power to renewable
Living in Rhone-Alpes too, I'm kinda scared of all the old plants around
If only our "green" party was pushing for sane policies instead of spouting bullshit and conspiracy theories
But it keeps getting more popular, so I guess their formula is working
I'm suprised to see that germany isn't more obese than France, they tend to eat much larger quantities than us and yet they manage to stay slim
I guess they eat much more healthy food and exercice more
Obesity's not only a problem of eating bad food
It can also be linked with depression and anxiety
Maybe italie does, indeed, have better eating habits, but also, they might've sociological factors that set them in a healthy mental state
What's the criteria for being «obese»
I didn't imagine there were so many obeses in the UK
I consider myself fat for a Frenchman, and my BMI is 24
English breakfast is super health
Obesity makes you higher at risk of dying of Covid if you're infected
Thankfully, italie's in the lower end, it could've worsen their already bad situation
Nothing wrong with cerals, as long as you don't eat more than 30-45 grams per serving
Well we don't have an obesity problem bc most people eat healthy and varied, we also exercise a lot
The french know how to cook, that's the difference with the brits
Oh yeah, good point, I forgot that we litteraly eat a baguette everyday, so that must defenitly help to even things out
Lol
>Siesta is great on weekends, though
Also, I think it's a good thing, not something it makes you get fatter
I'm not sure
Just some examples:
[Loredo, José S., et al

" Chest 156
2 (2019): 348-356
"In a population of young to older adult Hispanic/Latino subjects, we  found an inverse linear association between sleep duration and the  prevalence of obesity
Daytime napping was strongly associated with greater adiposity
Interventional and longitudinal studies are needed to better understand  how abnormal sleep patterns contribute to the obesity epidemic
[Chen, Mengxue, et al

Fire already vandalized it
The only thing that could make it worse is if we made some fake ancient stuff to fix it
I don't want france to turn into a plastic museum
We are a country of avant-garde
People reacted like you when we built the Eiffel tower or the Louvre pyramid, but history showed that being bold is what makes things great
I love how Reddit is quick to blame "far-right" parties when the very Muslim immigrants these parties usually oppose are the most likely to deny the Holocaust
I guess it’s easier to blame White people than blame Brown immigrants and thus give credit to those "evil right-wing parties".
Edit: what the responses to my comment have shown me is that many so-called leftists today don’t really adhere to left-wing morality
Instead, they’ve become lobbyists on behalf of some ethnic groups
These responses have also shown me that people will deny statistical facts whenever they contradict their beliefs or interpret them in a way that suits them
I have lived in Arab countries and am myself the child of “Brown” immigrants to France
I know what I’m talking about
I also find it interesting that so many Europeans are unable to fathom the existence of a society, so different from theirs, that what they think is a given, like the Holocaust happening, wouldn’t be as such
What
Outlawing holocaust denial doesn't make people admit that the holocaust happened
How
I don’t disagree
I just find it off that people here are quick to blame the White Man without ever putting any blame of the Brown Man
And you can bet 90% of them are anti-semites
Just like in all Arab countries where Holocaust denial ranges anywhere from 70% to 90%.
The world is also nuanced
I do understand that "native" Italians too are to blame, most of which would vote for far-right but also far-left parties
Exactly
This religion is given some kind of protected status no other religion enjoys
Yes, which is my point exactly
I do, which is my point
Keep making assumptions to satisfy your buthurt at me pointing fingers at immigrants, for once, instead of White people
That’s a weird way of saying that there’s 87% of non-Muslim Italians who aren’t antisemitic
Also, go check the antisemitism index and other studies before you call it a "claim".

I’m kind of fascinated by this story
how can a chain keep boats off a pass
I mean, wouldn’t a big wooden boat launched at full speed break it or pull it out of its anchors
Or am I really underestimating the strength of a chain
Going to copy  paste a post I made :
Hello,
This week I read some articles and listened to a few podcasts concerning the Alstom affair:
This case revolves around the fact that the US government tried to pressure Alstom's management to sell the company to General electrics through bullying and menace of prison time linked to supposed corruption cases in south east asia where the french company was competing with a US company for a contract
The NSA gathered 300'00 emails and 72 Million elements (SMS, emails, phone conversation) on this case alone and tried (successfuly) to break individuals in the decision chain of Alstom in handing them over the company
The company is quite strategic, they are building the turbines for our nuclear submarines and they are also maintaining the turbines in our nuclear plants for instance
As you can imagine such a strategic assets should have never left our control
We are already seeing effects of this buy out :
Alstom, now an american company, lately tried to pressure our national energy company in changing the contract and liabilities on nuclear defects by simply stopping the maintenance of the plants for a few days, a situation that is unheard of
This case is not unique, it happened with a few other big french companies (Technip, Alcatel
) and probably with a few European big ones as well (Siemens for instance)
And I feel this subject is not discussed enough and not known enough
Basically, the United states developed a range of legal tools that permits them to prosecute people who are not living in America and that should not be subject to American law, those tools can be either the use of the Dollar or the corruption law for instance
The funny thing is that this law is very rarely used to prosecute American companies, it is in majority foreign companies that are the target
Now, the sketchy part is the fact that they use jointly the NSA and governmental entities to gather data and spy on foreign companies and governments and then, hand in hand with private american's firms, they pressure those foreign companies in buy out deals
The really horrifying thing is that we don't even know how far this influence goes, for instance, I really wonder why the government didn't try to prevent this sale of a strategic asset, they were probably told to stay away
I am not anti American, in geopolitcs there are no "friends" only interests, but still the USA are so powerfull that this pressure is getting out of hand, it didn't even start under trump, in fact this extraterritoriality thing was most used under Obama
In any case, I thought about it quite a lot this week and as an european I wanted to share with you my thoughts
This economic warefare is a vital topic and needs to be discussed with your local representatives and your governments
In order to stay independent and sovereign measures have to be discussed to counter this
Cheers,
Nice
>Germans are trustworthy towards french people
I think it had to do with our culture
We were originallyy called Francs/Franks, because we were, and still are pretty frank when we talk
I would even use outspoken to describe it
We voice our opinions, especially if it's a complaint (God we LOVE to complain)
I'm guessing that's what makes us trustworthy, being upfront and honest
Anyway love you Germans too
We are pretty close, culturally and naturally admire each other for our positive traits
Hey germany,  we love you too
I love how Great Britain written in german and read by a french just sounds like "Fat Britain"
Indeed, and sane people make a distinction between a government, and the people they represent
As a french I kind of find British monarchy ... pleasantly diverting - but perfidious British people, yerg !

Sorry the podcast I listened to are in french, you can probably put the subtitles though :
The interview of the Alstom's director jailed for 18 month in the states (Frédéric Pierucci):
He actually wrote a book about his "adventures" with the american government
The interview of the minister of economy at that time (Arnaud Montebourg):
According to both interviews and sources online, they do,
You have those that called it by the name of the tribe (just like us with the tribe of the Franks) they met there; the Alemanni, the Saksamaa
Those that use the formet Roman given name of Germania
Those that call it "the place of the various tribes / of the people"  Tyskland, Duitsland, Deutschland, ...
Those that call it "the place that is not our people" Niemcy, Německo
So ultimately, place wasn't made of one group of people, and it was different from the other groups, so we called you that
It's funny that France is still called Frankreich where we also are an amalgation of various people
The first Germanic tribe East a of us was the *Allemani*, so we called all German speakers *Allemands* (until the German unification when it came to mean only German citizens) and it stuck in modern geography
The Allemani are the ancestors of the current speakers of [Allemanic dialects] including Alsacians, Swabians and Allemanic Swiss
> Niemcy a Polish colleague once explained to me basically amounts to meaning 'Not us'
The Slavic exonym **nemets** comes fro proto-slavic and means originally "mute" as "people who don't speak the language" and therefore also means "foreigner".
In France there is a thing called "Bercy's lock": the Finance Minister (Bercy) has the power **not** to forward cases of tax fraud to a State prosecutor and instead privately negotiate the fine the fraudster will have to pay in exchange for immunity
It usually is a fraction of what they owe: the government typically favours getting cash in the bank during its current term rather than starting the years-long process of prosecuting the fraudsters and all that money going to their political opponents when they'll inevitably take over
Or the fines are not high enough
Well, lose Alsace Lorraine but gain Sardinia
Not bad
I feel offended on behalf of Portugal and I never even set a foot in the country

Good job, I hate it
you should have put Breizh on the center of France, and keep the France label for Brittany only
SOUFFRANCE
As a breton , I feel insulted that you didn't even bother to place Bretagne wrongly on the map
If you really want to piss off Benelux, you should:
* Merge Wallonia with France
* Merge Flanders and Brussels with the rest of the Netherlands and call it Holland
* Keep Luxembourg within Germany

So they protest against climate change, yet refuse to pay a few more cents per liter of fuel to finance the transition from fossil fuels to renewable resources and disincentivize needless driving
I guess it used to be a forest right here
Poor peloponnesian people annoyed by those flights tho, they should try to make a league or something to defend themselves against the noisy athenians aircrafts
There was an attempt
r/europe doing some Europe propaganda
Some polls showed that UK people are still for the brexit in the majority
Polls either show this or that it's 50-50%. So no
UK people haven't be misled
They decided to quit EU in majority
And they still do
Don't try to prove the opposite by selecting a random citizen that says what you want to let believe to Europeans
Assume what you did Brits
You pergectly knew what you were doing
The consequences have been told again and again
If a new referendum is organized and the remain win, the EU will seem like the less democratic organization
Please be my mom you damn smart beast
Time to reforge the Auld Alliance brothers
It makes no sense to force people to vote
The decision is not any better because you forced uninformed people or people who don't care about the issue to vote, on the contrary
How so
Almost 63 million people voted for Trump, we're far from a small group
There's just the electoral college issue but it's pretty irrelevant to this discussion
If whoever decided not to show up aren't happy with the result, then they should have showed up, their loss
If not, then count them with those who are happy or indifferent with the result
If Hillary had won you could have said the same thing then, a small group of highly motivated voters
It just shows your bias
And seriously can you even read
I addressed the issue of the electoral college, it's completely off topic
If nobody cares about those elections then there's something wrong in the American political culture
Although I admit it seems weird to me to elect sheriffs, judges, attorneys and school boards since they are not political positions
I think responsibility is something learnt, if you force people it's just infantilisation, that's not how the democratic process should be
If people don't care enough then they deserve people abusing their apathy
Why are you commenting on /r/europe
No, because if you have voted you didn't let go of the chance for this situation not to happen
(If we suppose you had a choice that fitted you more, which is clearly the case for Brexit as it's completely binary)
Let me give you an example, just today I realised I wouldn't have some administrative papers when I need them because I did the demand too late
And all I can tell myself is "I deserve this because I didn't do it when I should have". Now, if I did the procedure 4 months before when I should have and the administration still didn't send me the papers in time, then I wouldn't think I deserve it, because I did all I could
Ok I understand your problem now
When I said "we're far from a small group" it was in the context of the discussion, with the meaning "it's not a small group at all". It doesn't seem that much used in English so I probably just made a Gallicism from "on est loin".

The EU gives a lot of aid in general
Plus, the Balkans are within Europe so the EU feels morally responsible
Plus there's a healthy dose of self-interest: having poor beggars on your doorstep is asking for problems, especially when you could have loyal allies, employees and customers instead

Voilà!
For a lot of them, sadly, the damage is already done, some orchards and vineyards have already lost up to 80% of their expected production in southern France
The issue is that we did have some very nice days at the end March before that brutal late forst episode, so burgeons developped during the nice days, and frost killed them the last few days
I am still upset a so good show died so pathetically
Besançon ?
it is not like he considered UK at all, this is bullshit,
even without the brexit, it also make zero sense to build any major production in UK, when there are more convenient options in EU
I've heard it's difficult to revert brexit because invalidating a referendum would set a precedent that voting is unreliable
To be honest it's a historic that so many regret that vote
We are inside the UE they packed too
Yeah let's stay in this dysfonctionning structure just for a Telsa factory
Except majority of turks support erdogan
Also, the river that runs through Rivendell and that Elrond causes to flood to save Frodo is called the Bruinen, translated into English as Loudwater

Strasbourg is very bike friendly i like it, but I've been to Amsterdam (for, uuuh
reasons) and bike wise they're on a whole other level
They are working on it right now
For example Nation, Bastille and the nearby boulevards have all been redesigned to reduce the space dedicated to cars
I dream of this
I think the political will is there, it just comes down to whether it gets translated into action or not
They absolutely don't
I'm from Paris
I agree that it'd be great but the subway is already often hella packed
Our mayor has been trying to make driving more annoying but without enhancing public transportation
You can't just blame car drivers, everybody has to find a way to move around

I honestly expect UK to be back AS SOON AS Europe federalizes
All is forgiven
Until then, hang on
Pretty sure the British MP won't be in the EU anymore
I know many will oppose it, just like many oppose it in France, but it's the inevitable course of history
No singular sovereign state in Europe can rival superpowers like US, China & India etc
- only coalition
It really should be common sense by now
It is really as simple as bargaining position, be it economical or political
I find it surprising that it needs any explanation
Any state who wishes to negotiate individually with these superpowers hopes to have something to gain over its neighbors or "rivals", but always gets taken advantage of instead
But I like to think critically as well, so to look on the flip side, are there that many conflicts of interest that we shouldn't? It is not as though cultures and languages will perish overnight once we integrate
We share more common goals than not, and frankly the EU is at an awkward stage right now & many grievances UK shared were due to the loose structure of the EU
The EU was always meant to be transitional (with the goal being federalization) & we need to move forward
The union will act more fairly with its structure better defined
but you know they will be, very soon
We're not planning for now but the future (could be very near future) imo Europe couldn't be federalizing soon enough
Something just occurred to me as a metaphor, maybe it'll help illustrating our current state of affairs
Think of the Balkans & how we look at the Balkans
This is what we look like to US & China
We're Balkans to them
We are already fragments because the EU is not enough (clearly) to hold the states together
So it's quite the opposite
Federalization should be fixing the fragmentation problem and unite the nations on many fronts of international importance
And as much as it is an idealistic picture to be satisfied being independent, our core interests are getting more intertwined which is again, truly inevitable

France, Germany, Uk are still individually ahead of India and Brazil in GDP per IMF 2018 figures
By the way, one drawback of EU for German/French/Italian and later British people was/is the social dumping generated by the entry of cheap labour countries along foreign immigration movements continuously occuring

4:20 on the phone, slim paper, pretty sure that's a joint
I think there is a big difference in context
Nazi Germany attacked a neutral country, the Netherlands, and arrived in Rotterdam in a few days
The Dutch were negotiating with the German army regarding a surrender, but the German Army had already sent their bombers
They tried to call them off but the German bombers did not receive the order to stop the bombing
The bombing could have been prevented if the German army did not fuck up there
Regarding Dresden, the allies are still fighting in Belgium at that time (February 1945) and Nazi Germany has shown that they will not surrender, no matter what
Dresden was a military target with many factories, which is why it was bombed
The problem with Dresden is that incendiary bombs were used and that people argue that Dresden was not actually a very important military target

The Brexiteers are a group of UK politicians who have repeatedly and stridently shot down any proposed way of leaving the European Union but insist that Brexit must happen
Just not like [whatever the proposal is]
The joke is that when prompted to shout out what they want, they're incapable of doing so; they have no vision or ability to articulate a coherent stance
So instead, they just default to shouting that -whatever the hell it is they want- they want it **NOW**. Which is pretty accurate considering they've shot down some deals by virtue of not getting out of the EU fast enough
How come so many UK pictures posted here walk such a fine line between /r/CozyPlaces  and /r/evilbuildings ?
Sadly, they're not real
British MP are living in another world
UK already has the best membership of the EU
They chose à la carte the parts of Europe they wanted and which they didn't wanted
They vetoed for years everything that would lead Europe towards more integration and less being just one big market
They even get a rebate on their participation of the budget
And of course, they can vote on the decisions
Now they chose to shoot themselves on the foot
Let's lose right of vote on how this market works, seems a good idea
But they hope to get a deal that, except from voting rights, would look like an even better membership, without paying

I have hijacked my kid’s paddling pool
I live in Paris
I only know two people who moved out
One had shitty parents and left at 24, the other just wanted to live on her own is 22
There is also no stigma for living with your parents when your in university
It is somewhat different when you get a job because it can be awkward to date someone who still live with his/her parents but those people still exist
I think we also did comedic movies about 40 years old that won't leave their parents, that is something only medittarraneans will relate with I guess
Tanguy, parti ! Tanguy, parti !
Not it is not, it is on average
A lot of students move out to a big city or Paris like you said

I can't get how Eastern France (Alsace) can be less developped than other regions I  travelled or lived in France (Finistere in western France f.e.) or in Europe
What are the indicators ?
It hurts to see the whole region "PACA" of France as developed except for Marseille
If you are an investor, Choose: Southern Italy or Eastern Poland
Yeah, but that's because we have the space to build highways where there is nothing
And there is nothing in a lot of places in France
The northern region actually has the biggest population density after Île-de-France, but if you go directly from Lille to Paris, you avoid the cities
This is not a map of the city founded by the Roman Empire
This is map of the city/fort founded by the legions
Maybe
Clearly not a good map
Well precisely, most of them were forts, not cities
Most places in France have just been turned into gallo-roman cities/villages/towns instead of building new stuff
That's how the Romans rolled most of the time: we get you in the empire and you do your shit on your own
The whole map is probably trash
A lot of these cities were "refounded" by the romans, ancient cities/villages being emptied and peoples settling in the new Roman city
It's the case of Toulouse for example, but it doesn't appear on this map
Rome's Hellenic provinces in the east, except Egypt(which wasn't Hellenic except for Alexandria), were more urbanised than Italy
No, most cities started as villages and then fortified themselves
Most Roman forts were abandonned anyway
...no
Northern Italy was a rural backwater
Central Italy was urbanised
What we call Northern Italy today wasn't even called considered Italy until the last years of the Republic
It was populated by Gallic tribes that weren't fully Romanised until after Augustus

It is Fort Saint Jean
On the other bank there is Fort Saint Nicolas
Fort Saint Jean, until 1944, was having a marble-made tidal scale that has been used to measure French sea-level
From 1883, French elevations are measured against another tidal scale, still in Marseille, a bit Further South
There are so many stories to tell about this fort
Ancient Greek buldings dating 400 BC were also found here, making 2600 years old Marseille the oldest city in France
Where is the famous sardine blocking the port ?
Kalash kalash
Rpz
Smells like piss, full of thugs and corrupt as hell
But, yeah, there are some nice sceneries
I've lived in Marseille for 16 years, and most of it was in the "bad" suburbs in the northern districts
Never seen any of the "bad" stuff people here are pretending to have seen
Sure, as with any big city there are poverty, there are some troubles, but nothing more than what I've seen in other big cities like Glasgow, San Francisco, Berlin or Athens
If you listen to people here, they'll tell you that you'll get mugged every 100 meters, or worse
On peut même voir la sardine qui a bouché le port
You dont want it trust me
True Marseillais still feel a connection with Greece, so guys Marseille is also your place
We even have a Greek church, and the street from the main train station is called rue d'Athènes, Athens street
And of course, the colors of the city are white and blue
Cool

Useless comparison
Different weather/climate, different lifestyle
That's the conclusion I want to agree with .. BUT that's not what this chart is about
If anything, it's about testing policy
Now show me a chart about COVID death amounts and I'll come to this conclusion
The weather is helping european countries atm
Maks have little to do with the low numbers
I was thinking the lockdown would have a big impact on road casualties
Actually yes and no
The number fell drastically, but are a small amount compared to the CV toll
About 300 less road death versus 30 000 covid death here
1%. So even if there a little more or less of other kind of death because of the lockdown it's still by far the right way to count
Probably but the "flu death season", if I can put it like that, had already happened from fall to lockdown
Would be interesting to see a detailed analysis
Well it's a complex issue we don't understand yet why some places were hit harder than others
By the way you should put " département" in quotation marks, for international redditors to get what you mean, because it means in France "county sized administrative area" but otherwise it means, in English, "some part of a company".

On a serious note, it’s so weird seeing so much Italians hating us while we don’t have any hard feelings towards you guys
The best thing about being French is football :
Play against Belgium ? Feels like a derby
Play against England ? Feels like a derby
Play against Germany ? Feels like a derby
Play against Spain ? Feels like a derby
Play against Italia ? It’s war my dude
we're secretly jealous of Italy's role during the renaissance
Hey I've googled Lisbon once
Ah ok
From what I saw on Internet I thought it was more serious than that :)

Ah yes, this famous painting by Leon Do Vinov was commissioned by no other than Ivan The Great during his last years of reign
Dubbed "The Vlad", the painting meant to represent the stoic face of who we now believe to be Ivan's secret lover
His hope was to instill the acceptance of homosexuality into russian people's heart, "for when people are caught in the sweet gaze of this magnificent face, they won't be able refute the feeling that's growing inside them".
Any resemblance with a famous dictator would be an absolute coincidence

I'm to late to the party but here it goes
In France there is this end of school exam
It's the end of high school (US), gymnasium (DE), you see what I mean
It's called the baccalauréat, or bac
100 before the first day of exam it's the "Père 100" tradition where high school student put on the white lab coat (we almost never use) and throw flour and eggs at passerbys, while being chased by the police
Huge fun but I think it's morecand more forbidden and less and less common
When I did it the flour line up in city supermarkets where emp-ti-ed this day ! All disappeared, with some random flour right and left from early battles
Back then it was already forbidden to use eggs and flour, but confettis where tolerated
The deal was to let the steam off in a "violent" outburst, before starting the last 100 days period of working for the exam
Now that I think of it I never hear about it anymore
Maybe it was a south of France tradition
Whoever made this map missed the golden opportunity to add a *via futura* leading to Teutoburg Forest *statio futura*.
It's [Vienne] a small city near Lyon

Whut ? This is nonsense and revisionism
They did a lot of damage in europe too and i'm no fan of the mongols wrecking everyone
But we can learn from studying it
edit this is apparently about the CCP's discrimination against ethnically mongol citizens even more than the conquest of china by the mongols
Maybe China should stop oppressing its citizens so hard, stop running camps instead of wasting it's time trying to interfere in europe ?
How can you even do an exhibit about Gengis Khan without mentioning the terms "Gengis Khan", "Empire" or "mongol"?
So there was this nomad *Temüjin*, who rallied a few fellow *steppe nomads* and went to conquer half of the world, to establish the largest *kingdom* the world has ever seen
Alright, so I will use the word "Genghis Khan" even more, thank you
The chinese governement is like a compass for me in life
Whenever I am lost, I do exactly the opposite of what they say
Smh why
"The conqueror who was formerly known as Khan"
They kinda have to
You can't rewrite history alone in your corner anymore, you need the other nations to comply with your rewriting
Otherwise, your targets, your own citizens, will still be exposed to differing worldviews and a part of them will fight you for it (while another part will remain loyal whatever they see or hear, though, if you did your job well)
>Counting the Khans as Chinese emperors is basically like counting Odoacer as Roman emperor
Odoacer is honestly more legitimate of an emperor than Romulus Augustus

Got up there during a school trip in high school
We initially thought we would just go to the top then go back down, but a guide at the top actually made us go all the way around the crater
It was kind of scary (nothing to stop you from jumping down in the crater), but amazing, the view from up there over the bay was truly beautiful

This guy is definitely a hero
Heroism has no color or country
Macron met him today, gave him a medal and "certificate of devotion" and committed to helping him get naturalized and become a fireman
All good so far
it's all over French news, which is a good thing and all, but
Most news sites are posting the original snapchat video, which had a caption "le coran jpete un cable", translated as "On the
Quran I'm freaking out". It's on the Reddit thread yesterday
Most news sites are **removing/censoring the caption**. [Le Monde
Now I'm sure there are good intentions behind this, but this is fucked up
The simple fact that journalists felt they had to censor proves they think the debate on Muslim integration has reached hysteria levels and leaving it in would obfuscate and distract from heroism on display
A few years ago that anecdotal caption would have been fine
Today major news sites feel like they have to remove it, giving plenty of ammunition to the far right for their growing screams of "fake news" and "islamo-leftists".
I don't like where this is going
The fact that people are turning this into something political about immigration (as if this isolated event somehow validates the disastrous immigration policies on one side, and as if it was an organized communication stunt on the other) shows how fucking ridiculous the current political debate has become
Anyway, good on him
I am glad he was made a citizen, definitely a good decision and a overall good message to send
Don't know if it was mentioned but on top of French citizenship he'll join Paris fire brigade, the most prestigious one
> A few years ago that anecdotal caption would have been fine
Seriously ? The caption is just ugly and distracting
Whatever the message most news media would have removed it
Why leave a message that is just a personal statement and very useless, but feel free to recuperate this for your political trolling
Good job
I hope you are right but the newspapers comments sections have been incredibly toxic lately, moreso than usual, so  i can totally picture the editor saying “ok hide this caption it will only make things worse”. When in fact the decision to do so does make things worse by fueling racist conspiracy theories
Agreed, but here they can compare both videos and scream "Look
the media is hiding that we are being invaded
We were right all along
". If we had a french Alex Jones, he would be on this immediately
We never truly like our president
Myself i voted for him but i'm not a big fan either
But he's not that unpopular
I doubt most of us hate him honestly
Damn French

Have you seen the [Carlsberg Museum entrance in Copenhagen]
Thankfully, The swastikas are carved on Hindu style elephants, so the reference is clear
Still a surprising site when you're not expecting it XD
Louis croix vé, I don't see the baton
All streets in cities in France have these more modern metal plaques
It's still surprising, I find, that the older royalist engravings survived France's Revolutionary, Republican and Imperial periods, which were sometimes violently anti-royalist of course
Constitutions matter
Eh, well while it was an extremely tense moment in French history, we changed our constitution via a referendum with a 83% approval and 80% participation rate, you can hardly get less contentious than that

Is there a ranking
Nothing says "soft power" better than a nuclear submarine
I'm talking about the thread, not your response to my initial comment
Anyway, it's pointless now to keep arguing about it :)
I'm sure France was 140
A lot of highways in germany have parts limited to 120
Also if you have an accident and speed is the problem, and you were over 130, you might have some insurance problems, as far as I know
In France it is 130, but 110 if it rains
So if the UK applied the same reasoning, it would be 110 in the UK
Don't worry, prepare to see 110-100 everywhere very soon :)
A bit understandable given how mountainous the area is, but I agree
why would you do this
I thought it was way bigger than these microstates but you convinced me it's actually not that big and should be considered as a microstate
My bad, I always thought Monaco was as big as Singapore .
If your size is less than 5 times Andorra you're definitely a microstate
Unless the UK somehow utterly breaks down, I honestly don't see a reason to alter the Union Jack, it's an integral part of the history of the UK
Moving on is one thing, erasing the past is another and makes no sense

Corsica can go lol ,if they want to no one can stop them
They're quite feisty to say the least
>Absolute nonsense and insane that it's being upvoted
Is it really [that surprising] though
Dude there's just a natural tendencies here in mainland Europe to make England the boogeyman of the continent
I think a lot of people quite disike the example that this sets
It's fine for old people to want to leave the EU,but it completely shaft younger people by removing the freedom of movement and the all the  opportunities study wise
I Lived in both france,ireland,scotland and Australia
I went to university in Ireland
Without the EU I would have had to pay ricidiculous prices
Also Australia was hell to get into,so incredibly restrictive
No you are right,I do joke,but that kind of stuff is never quick and easy
As you say,most likely an overwhelming majority would be necessary
Also like for Catalonia part of the reason things are so restrictive is because there is a possibility of a domino effect starting up once the integrity of the state is comprised
But they're still the one with the greatest chance to secede
I'd rather it not be that way personally,I know quite a few Corsicans and they seem quite content for the moment
Look I'm not saying England policies are altruistic as a whole,but which country doesn't act for its own self interest
We should ignore them and let them do their own things, they've always been aloof from the rest of Europe to be honest
No need to have a vendetta against them
Yeah no Corsica is fine but Brittany can't go their food is just too good it would a national catastrophy
Let's indeed not fuckup all this and we'll be A ok

Didn't something similar happen a few (many
) years ago where the EU sent a ton of money to Romania to improve the infrastructure and build highways that would eventually benefit romanians and the EU in the long term, but instead they (the corrupt people that could act on that) bought cheap land here and there, decided highways absolutely needed to run across their property, then used the EU funds to pay the landowners (themselves) insane expropriation fees and now there are small bits of highways isolated in the middle of bumfuck nowhere in Romania

Why would you think that
Owning a gun isn't synonymous with 'defending yourself', I don't know what kind of gun-lover's logic you have to follow to put that in your mind

German as a culture was a thing though
Austria definitely existed and didn't include Salzburg
The archduchy of Austria had existed for almost 300 years when Mozart was born
Saying Austria didn't exist at the time would be like saying France didn't exist at the time even though there was a big chunk of land known as the kingdom of France

So, an old example of Goodhart's law
There is close to a century between these two
One is an accepted king that ruled and died as a ruler
Hitler was different, he doesn't have statues because he died losing a world war and was a tyrant
It's not only about the horror, its also about the ruling time

This one is the next on my list !
The fuck are they thinking
The people too
Those who are painted on the walls are people who had a role in the history of the city
Some of them are:
* [Antoine de Saint-Exupéry] (writer of *The Little Prince*),
* The chef [Paul Bocuse] (who has 3 Michelin stars since 1965),
* [Auguste and Louis Lumière] (invented the cinema)
* [Abbé Pierre] (founder of the Emmaus movement, the biggest solidarity association in France)
* [Marcel Mérieux] (founder of the pharmaceutical empire Biomérieux, Merial & Sanofi)
* [Claude Bernard] (19th century doctor, inventor of experimental medecine and blind experiments, and discoverer of homeostasis)
* [Claude Bourgelat] (created the first veterinary schools in the world)
* [André-Marie Ampère] (scientist, discovered electrodynamics, invented the telegraph and the electromagnet)
* [Joseph-Marie Jacquard] (invented the automatic & programmable loom for the creation of silk fabric with patterns
Those looms used perforated cards that were later used as the first forms of stocking computer programs)
Complete list here:

Communism and USSR expansion were really seen as a threat
During the phony war, there were lots of conference held by soldiers for instance to explain what was the problem with Finland
Weapons, as in modern planes were sent there
Allies made attempts and plans to organise help for Finland, ranging from attacking USSR in the Caucasus or landing in Finland to help
Troops were picked and ships ready to be sent to Finland in the beginning of 1940
Those original plans and troops were later used for the Norway invasion

This pushes the question of waste control
Imo, countries creating waste should be responsible for overseeing said waste, if not for treating it
The globalization of waste treatment is a critical failure currently
These actions are clearly illegal, so I doubt regulation would help
Our problem is that waste management is the end of a long chain of intermediaries which dilute the responsibility of each member of that chain regarding the end result
Waste management globalization may be illegal in a different world, but right now, it doesn't work
By responsible, I meant accountable
Untimately, when such things happen, countries that produced the waste should get fined or condemned to restore the site

Man, you can completely reverse this question
Why are monarchist go on and on about their kings, queens or whatever
Every fucking week, someone post some tabloidy post about "oh look what our <insert person> has done
hm, we'll see what we can do
our remaining royals are pretty scuffed, wouldn't make a very nice gift
>Being happy and proud of your king
You are proud of some guy who was just born in this position
That's such an accomplishment
>And you were born in your position which I assume is a first world country, does that mean you can't be proud of your accomplishments
Of MY accomplishments, yes
I am not proud of someone else's.  That would be ridiculous
> The man was born and bred into his role
That is the exact reverse of democracy
You could say the same for Kim Jon Un
And that is the issue at hand
I understand that you refuse to see it, but monarchies are incompatible with a full democracy

Baise, ouais !
It is 2,46km long
Qu'est-ce que les anglais ont à voir là-dedans ?
Bah écoute tu suces qui tu veux mon gars mais je ne te suis pas sur ce coup là !
It's so perfidious it must be
Nothing really
Just an habit of r/france to taunt the "perfide Albion", old style
Thats really not aggressive though, France and UK have always loved/hated them like dogs and cats :)
shhhhh
Tesla makes 100 year old watermills
Croatia doesn't have ski slopes
That Sljeme is a joke
Well yeah Croatia organizes it and the elevation is really not much its just a bigger hill
Well Europadios ain't happening soon

I really am seeing a new angle to brexit now
Not so sure it'll serve as a counter example for leavers but it complicated things
Now, as the same question in countries that suffered as a result of the EU, and you’d see a different pattern
This feels a bit too Lebensraum to me
And Alsace to central Europe, really
mouhaha, Lyon makes it to the South but not Toulouse/Bayonne/Pau, that's quite a red flag for this map imho \^\^
I can hear German early 20th century militarism talking through this map
Odd how France, Italy, Romania, Serbia, Belarus and Ukraine are the only countries split between different zones
It almost matches perfectly the central powers WW1 objectives
Cultural proximity lmao Lyon, Genève and Chambéry in 3 different cultural areas, this HOI4 roleplayer needs to read some books if he's trying to tell me I live in an incredibly multicultural area of Europe
From West of France and I formally reject my cultural similarities with the UK
fuck france, romania and ukraine in particular
This is not okay
I understand that no one wants to be called Eastern Europe but you can't just keep pushing the line eastward and eastward
Nice imperial map
Alsace in Germany ? Poland with Germany ? Bordeaux and Toulouse with Paris, not Lyon and Marseilles
Estonia without Finland
In this case, Western Europe will be reorganized as the Great Atlantic Empire for a more secure society, safe from the Roman threat that the First Wineyard Empire represents
They didn’t manage to get it by force, so now they try other ways
don't know either
Even the north south border within France is weird, it should be between olive oil and butter :)
But yeah, those borders are weird
Let's just stay with Europe for all
Born and raised in Lyon, I do question the Southern Europe border too
South Tyrol I think
Used to be ruled by Austria
I like to think they live in the future :)

I love that the oldest business in China is almost 1000 years old and it’s bucket chicken
Is it only me that has seen this map about 20 times on Reddit in the last 10 days
Ho Irland
Same with Monnaie de Paris, which is the state owned currency regulator
The actual oldest could be the paper company Richard de Bas from the 14th century
The skyscrapers look like they've been photoshoped inside the city though, they don't really go with the rest
So Vilnius is City17
Hey fellow Europeans, I just want to tell you that we won't give in, you can count on us
Still, these are sad times
The suspect was caught in a kebab fast food
I'm not making this up lol
We don’t know anything yet
The use of a gun is unusual in recent Islamist attacks and apparently the priest had just won a legal case against a guy (a former monk) for harassment
It could very well be a personal matter gone bad
Yet another proof that this is not about drawings and caricatures
It is about the lunacy of enforcing intolerant, conservatist, and foreign values in a secular democracy, through intimidation
The authorities are still not sure whether it was a terrorist attack or not : [ (article in french)
Apparently this priest had serious issues with another monk from the Orthodox community
I just hope this has nothing to do with the recent tensions between Greece and Turkey, because it could get ugly really quickly
lmao to all people on this thread jumping on the anti islam train while according to the latest news it's not a terrorist attack
Yeah I mean you can't have soldiers in every street
> This happened a few hours after again Erdogan said that ''satire targeted on him is against all Islam and west will pay for it''. Also not random that the Greek orthodox church was targeted
Also 3 days after turkish intelligence tried to have the local turks orchestrate an anti-armenian pogrom in several french cities and had them attack the police forces in vienne and several churches
Hard not to see the link
Odds are ankara ordered that attack
> Dear Muslims, please stop killing people
This guy has ended world terrorism, you won't believe how
Thank you
Unity in Diversity
Yeah, I'm honestly disappointed to see how many governments prefer silence over courage, but what matters the most is the support from the citizens of these countries, so thank you
Thanks, you trained us well to fight extremism
(Just joking of course, sorry if you find it offensive)
Thanks, to be honest I'm proud to live in the country that these fanatics target first: it is tough but we have the honor to stand for freedom
It's sad, but it's also an honor to be the most targetted country
It means we're standing for values that fanatics hate deeply
Now, I also think we're lacking EU solidarity at States levels, but at least people are united, just read the other comments if you have any doubt
Thanks a lot, I saw you had some troubles as well so stay strong too
Thanks, we will
Thank you very much
I wrote this at least 30 times in a row but I mean it
Thanks, stay strong too, you have your own hardships as well
*username checkout* thanks, satan
Hopefully one day we'll stand together as a World united against fanatism and barbarism, not as a continent against other countries
As long as it's not the case, stay strong too
Thanks, hopefully our values won't be used to justify far-right extremism: having that "backbone" is a doubled-edge blade
Anyway, as long as our values don't get corrupted, France will stay strong against fanatics
Thanks, too many people seem to think all muslims endorse violence, every occasion to prove them wrong is useful
Thank you, every country has its troubles so stay safe too, hope you weren't near the earthquake
PS: I'm afraid that not everyones thinks that but I don't care if you're Turk, German or Brasilian
We're all humans, all that matters is to be united against violence
Thanks and don't worry: we know how to deal with extremists, we proved it since 1936
Against this kind of ideology, not giving up caricatures and freedom of speech is something which demands too much courage for most states
You know that there was an official ceremony for Samuel Paty, that caricatures were displayed on some public buildings and that no officials nor cartoonist have any intention to give up free speech
You should check the meaning of giving in, because we're not giving in nor giving up our values
Le Pen is still very far away from being elected
She has max 25% in a second round
For now 30 years
We have long history of terrorism and immigration
Populists from left and right are not ruling the country
The attacker knew the priest, who was according the latest news disputed in his own community
Imagine the state of terrorism in France if guns were sold like that
Oh what a great idea, I'm sure all the islamist extremists won't benefit from being able to buy guns at the shop around the corner
Diversity is what brought us here
There is unity in identity, meaning that whatever your skin color/religion/political standing, you are French first and foremost
Which is something we haven't been able to ingrain and now we have Turkish people hunting Armenians in the streets of Lyon and beheadings in our very streets
>meaning that whatever your skin color/religion/political standing, you are French first and foremost
I almost agree, but I think that more important that identy is respect and tolerance
What brought us into this situation isn't diversity, it's the unability of some, in this case the islamists, to tolerate it
What you describe in your 2d paragraphe is a result of identitarism
No, I really think that the EU's motto is wise, and more important now than ever: welcome those who want to unite behind goals of peace, research and freedom, despite the diversity
Imo these goals do a better job at bringing us together than a national identity
Most attacks since 2015 were with knives though
But they are much rarer than attacks with knives
I agree with you on some points but unity at the country-level doesn't not inherently come from diversity
I think uniting behind goals of peace, research and freedom can be even more effective if each participating country believes in these ideals while retaining their core identity
Diversity at the EU-level is a good thing, each country has a point of view and way to approach things that can mesh well with the other countries and form a cohesive unit
At the country-level though, tribalism leads to infighting which is why an ideal such as the French republic, its values and our culture is a good centerpiece for French identity (which is not, and should not, be mutually exclusive to respect and tolerance)
Bringing in diversity that does not believe in that ideal and tolerating intolerance brought us here
My point was rushed in the way I phrased it
I don't necessarily blame diversity, only the acceptance of people who value another identity above the French identity
Believing that being a muslim, a christian, a homosexual, a Parisian, etc
is more important to you than being French inevitably leads to hostility between "tribes".
Yep, which is one of the reasons I'm not too fond of the EU
I think we want to same approximatly the same thing in different words
When you say being French, I prefer to say that we share the most important values, in order to avoid the confusion between priorising these values and ethnical identity
>A terrorist would certainly have no way to access a gun unless he stole one,
Completely deluded
> The black market always exists, whether guns are legal or not
Except it would be infinitely easier to get a gun on the right market than right now
Nice sophism
You can't compare countries like that
You could compare a single country before and after it allows guns though, but I'm not willing to let France be the Guinea pig
Totally triggered
I thiiink Germany is a bit outdated on this map
Swapping France, Great Britain and England ? How infuriating !

Now all my coworkers think I'm crazy for laughing so loud for no apparent reason
No no no, we did not steal anything, except maybe your sense of humour :)
Really, that's during WW2 when American soldiers liberated France
They discovered fries in North of France, loved them: BAM
French fries
I try to fix this historical huge mistake each time I can lol
Even George W Bush also tried, but well
Muricans :)
Ok, TBH I don't know where truth is
Anyway, we French did not steal fries reputation as far as I know
Actually, that was a pretty good laugh/relief for us when G W Bush decided to rename them as freedom fries
i am more amazed by than numbers of empty seats and how little attention MPs have to his speech (playing on phones
Good work everyone .
For a better visualisation:
Estonia are you ok
Jesus fuck what a day !
14 isn't too far from the optimal sleep temperature at 16°C. Gotta heat that back up when you wake up though
Without the atlantic currents, we would have 10 to 20 degrees less (just have to look the winter temperatures on the same lattitude, other side of the Atlantic)
Glad to know Greece still has electricity, I heard that Merkel was about to cut that too
It's what the temperature in your room should ideally be like, it gives the best sleep quality for a human (at least the average human)
Obviously it doesn't mean you shouldn't sleep under a blanket or something
Fun fact: she has spent 5 years and 3 months of her life being pregnant
They are almost all girls though, so no
Do not cheer her because her father was a bad person
I agree the filtering was stupid and she probably did other reprehensible things when in power, but the bit about her father is just silly if she was not involved
Where is she

What a shitty headline
First it's not the police but police unions
Second, they never threatened to join the protesters but to protest themselves
Three, they got what they wanted, extra money, so it's basically over
Anyway
Good
They should do it even though it's illegal for cops to be on strike
I can't wait to be "everyone for himself". If there is no cops, it's open bar
[Hopefully this]
If you conveniently ignore that he announced reforms that will cost 10 billions and refuses to pay 300m in unpaid overtime to policemen, sure
I don't know
Seems like the purge
Yes good description, thank you
The French don't take shit sitting down
Unlike other countries where the working classes have been shamed into compliance via "entitlement" talk, the French own it and fight at every turn
I wish it was that way everywhere
No one wanted him that much
Just look at the election's score
He passed the second round only because he was up against Le Pen which is basically a free win
First round he had less than a quarter of the votes
He was never majoritarily popular, I'm not sure if you think that "the populace" got together and all agreed on him, but that's not how this works, dear neighbor
Princess Leonor looks like your smaller sister who always wants to steal the remote to watch her series about horses
Princess Victoria looks like your successful big sister who always asks you at the family lunch if you are still single
Prince Charles looks a lot like that uncle who talks way too much about Arabs at that lunch
I just found out that Princess Elisabeth is 18
I guess it's time to marry her off to solidify the alliance with the French
Prince Jacques look like he has successfully overthrown the old republic to bring back order and security to the empire
Yeah, but from a pragmatic point of view, it does help
And if, by chance or otherwise, there's no direct descendants of the last king that's even easier
For France for example, there's 3 different persons claiming the throne
It's a very cold way to say what you feel from my point of view, but the Netherlands has been the target of terrorist attacks in the past
This isn't the first one
I'm sorry however that happened to your country, I think it's too much to me after the NZ terror attack
I'm remembering what we came across through 2015 and 2016 and that shouldn't happen again, but it does, again and again
Fuck them
> normal people
Sadly it's not all black and white
People who tend to harm others cover a very wide spectrum and even the people who are considered normal now may change over time
Often times it can't even be anticipated
In the words of Joker "Madness is like gravity, all it needs is a little push
statistically and objectively it isnt safety wise, especially in western nations
Unless that scares you of course
Can someone explain
You can approve or disprove each person in each list
[Meanwhile in France] We like to keep it simple to make sure every idiot can and does vote
If I understand it correcty, that ballot is the same for everyone in the Netherlands, or is this a local ballot for a local circonscription
If it's the former, doesn't seem like you have a lot of choices compared to the total population of the Netherlands
Edit: Well I think I'm confused because I'm used to our own semi-presidential system, but that begins to make sense reading the comments
Thanks a lot, now I understand how this works
but still why don't do like in France:
Each party prints his list, the elector choose minimum 3 list before going to the boot and can only put one in the enveloppe for it to be valide
Is it to save paper
you sure it works
Or is it you can vote a party different then the candidat you vote for
I say that because I counted votes in France a few times
It's boring and tedious but rather quick
If I recall between 500 and 600 vote are counted in a bout an hour with two tables of four people (so 8 people total)
Your way must take for ever and drive people crazy
If you get paired with someone that doesn't see well you should be excused if you ended up murdering him
Same
MPs are elected in single-member districts with a two-round first-past-the-post system
Regional and municipal elections use proportional representation (with a bonus for the party with the most votes, so not really proportional in fact) with closed lists
French comment isn't really annoying
If you want to _really_ piss off french people, ask for ice cubes with your wine
A better way to piss off the Portuguese is to ask them if they speak spanish rather than "brazilian" (more offensively, just engage conversation in spanish)
>american wines are better
I will cut someone
NO, FRENCH WINE ARE BETTER FU***** REDDITOR
Well done, I'm French and I was irritated by more than one thing
Telling that to a french doesn't piss him off, but it will make you lose all your credibility
Edit: "Italian wine" would be more effective
In Belgium you could totally mention that they are French
Or ask for French fries
Or pretty much anything French related will do
"American wines are better"
Oh, sweet summer child
Monster
That and saying "That's a good pâté" while speaking of foie gras
You mean when they had to hire experts from France because they used sterile tanks as barrels and couldn't figure out why it didn't work
Actually it's so ridiculous it's more funny than irritating
Napa wines are okay
Meh
If anything, "omelette du fromage" or "french surrender" are much more triggering to me
Especially when you just meet someone and they go "ahahah oh you're french ? OMELETTE DU FROMAGE HON HON HON"... Fucking hell mate, what ????
FIRE ZE MISSILES
[(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻]
I think we're okay
I mean we're arrogant enough to just mock you for believing that
I think you can annoy more people by saying Burgundy wine is better than Bordeaux in the South West and the opposite in the East
Oh it's funny to see my [top comment] in this
I didn't know that American vines existed
I'm sure that if you say "american vine" in front of any French, it'll just make him laugh at you
> (joke's on you, you messed up your flight and we get your tourist money)
Typical gypsies
^^^Now ^^^did ^^^that ^^^work ^^^?
> How is Sinterklaas racist
If anything that would be Zwarte Piet
I think that's part of what would annoy Dutch people with that comment
It just sounds like someone which really doesn't know anything about the tradition meddling with things which don't affect them
As I understand it, that's what annoys Dutch people the most about the controversy - the amount of people getting involved which don't actually know anything about the tradition and its history
Oh yeah, this one is clearly better
My mother knew a slovak girl, not long after the independance, and everytime when people asked where she come from, and before anyone said anything she pointed out that Slovakia is not Czechoslovakia or Czech republic
*recoils in horror*
Answer them that french wines are californian, because french vines were destroyed and we had to import them back in the 60's.
It can happen in stuff like sangria, or at cocktails, or wine served as a refreshment (although it's better to put wine bottles in a ice container if you want it cold)
Never during a lunch/dinner, or with good wine
Actually that title is being contested between us and Spain since a few years, the idea that France is the biggest wine exporter is false
But in term of €, we're still ahead
In volume only
In value France is still ahead
Meaning one bottle of French wine is worth 10 os Italian's.
> The French one is also wrong
They would find that comment hilarious
I know from experience that you can rustle les jimmies by declaring that English cheese is better
This would rather get you compassion
We all support your struggle to get ~~foreign~~ edible food, that's why no one complained when you started building an empire
And your Portuguese sounds like polish, Brazilian Portuguese is the real deal
Jk jk jk jk
We must have some leftover guillotines somewhere right ?
Bit earlier than that don't you think
Phylloxera was in the 19th century
But the point still stands
> How- You- I thought we were family
We are, we are
Just look at our flags, almost identical
This makes me think, diplomacy should seriously work based on flag colors
This would be so much easier
Even Brazilians don't understand the Portuguese if they talk too fast
They just ignore half the sounds in every word
We French got really left out in the whole mutual intelligibility thing
Damn Germanic people

And I'm just here, dreaming of being able to speak some words of Finnish to communicate with the people I dream the most of meeting, and giving up extremely quickly when confronted with how difficult it is
I'm French and I learned some Finnish many years ago
Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but it does get better with time, and if you can speak French which is the biggest mess ever, there's no reason why you couldn't learn some Finnish
And it's worth it to see the faces of the Finns when they meet a foreigner who speaks some of their language
Yes it was
I was taught the word back when I was learning Finnish, and since I daydream quite a lot, a Finn said this was a word I had to know
I think it's a beautiful word indeed, hard H, long A, the ei diphthong followed by the double L, it really has a beautiful flow
And as a bonus, it is often available when I sign up on websites like reddit
Hey, we're experts on British history !

Can we
It's not la défense or the suburbs that attract all these tourists to Paris, but mostly the old neoclassical or haussmannian buildings
We do try, but it doesn't work
Buildings like Jussieu, the Montparnasse tower, Bercy just stay ugly decades after they were built
All of those look like shit
I'm finding it hard to believe Hungary has a better english proficiency than France
Outside of Budapest I hardly found anyone able to hold a basic conversation in english,
Ha ! We are not the worst !

France can into Baltic
France surprisingly not at the bottom of Europe for English ? That a good surprise

What, *I* don't speak English
Why are *you* not speaking French
Can we have details on this index
(scale, how it's calculated etc)
As a French seeing my country's bad english scores, no surprise was found at all
Wasn't expecting Spain and Italy to score worse than us though
Here is a compilation of French presidents/prime minister speaking English:
Our politics speak English as bad as yours
French here, yes we avoid pronounce it but sometimes to balance we put it at places where it's not supposed to be hahahaha
I *ave* a lot of love for the HHHenglish languidge

Enfin quand même je veux bien avouer qu’on est pas au top mais nos voisins du Sud sont sacrément moyen en comparaison
badder
Well according to wikipedia[Wikipedia] 30 to 45% of English words are of French origin
So from a vocabulary standpoint, yes, there are a lot of bridges between the two languages even though there are a lot of "false friends".
But pronounciation is very very different, sentence structures are different, grammar, the use of prepositions, even the tenses
The closest languages to English would rather be Scots,  Frisian, Dutch, German, or even Norwegian
Chirac spoke good English too
We laughed a lot about him after his stroke in Jerusalem because it wasn’t perfect at all but he was very angry and that explained his mistakes
I think Fillon, Sarkozy prime minister speak good English too (his wife is welsh)
But indeed our politicians have the same weaknesses as we do in English
Oh okay I was wondering
EST EUROPA NUNC UNITA
Along with the nuclear weapons and the fact that Europe after WWII wasn't the dominating force in the world anymore so the implications of a war in europe for the winner is not as valuable as it was a few decades ago
Uh pretty sure it's Toussaint
someone was asking EU to recognize it
don’t recall it
what are EU weapons ? I know about national weapon (FR,DE,UK), never read about EU weapons yet

An American saying that is the biggest hypocrisy I've seen for a while

As a north african, sorry spain
I do think we sent you a bit more heat than usual
Would you want a refund tho ?
39 degrees in France yesterday
And here I am, in the UK, sitting inside with a woolly cardigan and fluffy socks
It's a different type of heat
I was in the UK during the 2018 heatwave and it was miserable because of the humidity despite it only reaching 33°C. Meanwhile here in Southern France we regularly get 35°C over the summer and it's not that bad because the air is dry, but I guess we're also more used to it
Above 40 is where it starts to be uncomfortable, especially in city centres
25°C is what we get during a normal day of spring/fall
I'd say it's the perfect temperature for me
It's weird how humans acclimate so much to their environment
I'm not Spanish, but I live in one of the hottest city of France (Toulouse, we got 39°C yesterday and normal summer temperature are often around 30°C)
Having AC in your home isn't that common, maybe in one home out of 4
Most stores / restaurants / public buildings have one though, but our grid is prepared and could even take more because we have higher overload in the winter than in summer (a lot of french heating appliances use electrical power)
And if you want to know why most houses don't have AC, it's because we're used to heat (if it's under 25°C, it's totally normal and until 30, 35°C it's not that bad either) and buildings are kinda built to protect us from these heatwaves even if, seeing as we commonly have 0-10°C temperatures in winter, it's hard to build houses that are both resistant to heat AND cold weather
This highest I ever witnessed was something like 42°C, and the lowest was -14°C (a range of 56°C)

It hurts that we'll never see a big ass EU army with the forces of France and the UK
It would have been a grand thing

Bridges are literally the symbol of making contact, diplomacy, unity, communication
« Building bridges » is also an expression, meaning creating relations
OC ? Thank you for protecting our beloved Europe
Glory to Polska
i forgot to say in my previous comment : i go to Polska many times to see friends in Wroclaw Poznan Warszawa Krakow,  please be my guest for a beer anytime you want
Or for wine, if you come to France
only 1 dead while they were several with rifles
Man we're lucky they don't recruit their most brained animals for these things
The least we can note is that they are organized, and have automatic weapons
6 coordinated attacks ?
edit would be nice to capture a couple alive ; tho that would be risky for the police
Europe keep getting poked at
I hope this is some isolated attacks we've had enough for this year
Stay safe Austrians
As a frenchman, I just wanted to show all of my support to Austrian people, we will stand together !
I want to give all my support to the people there
Austria we are with you
Stay strong Vienna
Welcome to Europe in 2020, unfortunately
It looks like Paris attacks with multiple shootings
All support to our austrians brtohers, stay safe
> As a french
Tu trolles r/france au passage ?
Is the guy who was shot 2 times dead ? :/
Always has been since a decade
They were off duty or police officers who work in plain clothes
We have police units in France (BAC, Street Crimes Unit) who work mostly in plain clothes
I disagree
All religions prevent people from using their brains on select issues
Just look at Poland right now
Obviously I'm not asking to ban religion (Robespierre was a pretty bad precedent) but I'll gladly say ALL religions suck
> No you shit terrorists you won't spur our hatred towards anyone but radicals like you
lol
>No you shit terrorists you won't spur our hatred towards anyone but radicals like you
It is because of people like you that Europe has been sinking for years
People are being beheaded or shot, and you continue to speak the language that has been sinking us for years
Pas du tout, je savais même pas que r/france existait
Mea culpa, ce post a fait la une il y a deux jours:
I don't side with le Pen and I don't support kicking all the muslims out but saying that these attacks will not spur hatred towards anyone but radicals is ridiculous
Maybe they are like you in your countries which are relatively spared by this type of terrorism, but in France opinion is beginning to change
At the same time when people get beheaded in the street, terrorists get blown up, people in bars get shot, it changes the opinion a bit, you know
Especially when this terrorism **always** comes from the same religion
Ah désolé, j'etait pas au courrant, du coup je vais vite corriger l'erreur
You're completely crazy, dude
What the hell man, I told you I'm not a Le Pen supporter
I support Macron's stance in this and I have nothing against assimilated muslims
You've been talking to yourself

I don't even know what dude you are talking about

Most of the wild boars have untraceably low amounts of cesium
The others get up to 1500Bq/kg
I don't how much you love eating wild boar but if you aren't Obelix, those levels are perfectly fine
An human adult will hold an average of 8000Bq and we dont kill ourselves by radioactivity

When I taught French in Canada we had to show the students this video series with a talking pineapple and dancing skeletons
It was terrifying
Real pizza is American though
Not all, but lots of things (including pizzas) are called hawain when they contain pizza in France too

My MEP heavily support the article 13
I might aswell just send him my shit to have some reaction from him
There are barely any MEP in France who don't support it :(
Sure they can, but when you have sky rocketing criminality making a petition against the creation of laws and police to enforce them because of the risk of police brutality is just plain stupid
By doing so, you're saying "well since I'm a greedy cunt and don't want to pay for content, I'm fine with pédo/terroriste sites". It's even stupidier to me, when technically it's just a transfert of what GAFA do with out any control to some form of state org who going to control it a bit and on which people will have influence
Bold move, they've got my support
Does that mean that Lithuania recognizes the seat of President of Belarus as vacant
As Lukashenko is pretty good friends with Putin, how do you think this will play out
Edited to continue the question: with regards to Lithuania-Russia relations
when was the last time lithuania decided who is the leader of another country
embarrassing that people spend time on this shit with straight faces
I'd like to see the EU take a much harder line on Russia
Seeing the influence campaign they're carrying out against the US and EU is very disturbing
Recognizing her as government-in-exile wouldn’t really be that legal though
Though I believe that she did win the election, we have no concrete proof that it’s the case
All we now is that the results were rigged, we can’t call for anything more than new, independently regulated elections
It would take a concerted effort by EU members, but it would be possible: start more drilling in Algeria
There's plenty of oil and gas, and the country would be happy to have the business
Increase production in Norway, and buy more from Qatar and elsewhere
You could find a lot of people in France who would not mind torching this part

The french government does not use procurement in this case because the passports are printed by the State

We love you too Scotland
Well free not really , as a french student you still have to pay for healthcare and somme school fees (spent around 400€ for this year) there is also 7k€/year schools , so it’s not really free even if it’s way cheaper
So meanwhile in France students are wrecking everything because extra-eu stduents fees are increasing to 2k€
What a kick in the nads for the English
Could not believe this when I found that my (french) son could study for a year in Scotland for free
That is neoliberalism for you

Interesting ones (according to me):
- Gaston Monnerville, politician and lawyer, he was the president of the Senate from 1958 to 1968
Note that the president of the senate takes temporarily over from a dead president of the republic
So it is not a minor post
- Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, general in the French Revolution and father of Alexandre Dumas (The 3 musketeers)
- Chevalier de Saint-Georges, composer, conductor, and violinist, master fencer and military man
- Severiano de Heredia, president of the municipal council of Paris (1879–1880/ sort of mayor of Paris ), deputy for Paris (1881–1889), minister (1887)
- Eugene Bullard (not on the list because he was not French), flew planes for France during WWI
He escaped segregation in the USA, came to France, learned to fly planes
(Edit: Just found a 9mn movie about him:
For all its fauts, I doubt there is any other european country that can put such a list forward
[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas] such a badass that Nazis felt compelled to destroy his statue
Edit : ok, other people were quicker
France had a black president of the senate between 1947 and 1968 while in your country they couldnt even sit with white people in public transports
Dont even try to lecture us
Also sources about the slaves till the
1920s, sounds like bullshit to me
And "enslaved nations" is ridiculous
Especially coming from an american
Colonisation was a bad thing for plenty of reasons, including for the french people themselves, but it's not slavery
To be precise Haiti's deb was acquitted in 1830
1947 is when Haiti ended all payment on the loans they had contracted at that time
And while it certainly doesn't look good for France this debt is certainly not enough to explain Haiti's difficulties
>millions
Source ? As I said, pure bullshit
300 000 civilians
Which is to much, but not 1 million
Also

I wasnt even born
And I have no ancestors that fought in those wars
That's how history works : while people in France were taught the good side of things related to Napoleon, the rest of Europe portrayed him as a blood thirsty monster
I am no historian, but the context of Napoleon (the Revolution) "explains" his actions
To make things simple, right after the Revolution, there were three periods of turmoil, to put it kindly
The Terror (one of the worst dictatorship Europe has knew), the directorate in 1795, and then the Empire in 1799 (that's when Napoleon came to power)
Right after the fall of the 'Ancien regime", France was in a dire state of "War within and war outside" as it was facing the French people loyal to the monarchy inside, and the coalition of European monarchies that didn't want the idea(l) of the révolution to propagate to their own countries and put in question their "divine right". By the end of the Directorate, when napoleon seized power, France was at war with Britain, Austria, Prussia, the Kingdom of Naples, Russia, the Ottoman Empire and others
So one good thing, from a French perspective, is to have France survive against those odds thanks to him
The other good things is that he gave the means for clever French minds to modernize the country (he helped modernize justice and administrative systems in French, education system, sanitation in Paris, odd and even numbering of houses in the streets, pavements, production of sugar from beet roots, margarine, tin cans ...)
Then, while I don't understand or know why he needed to try to conquer Europe (I suppose there is retaliation and dissuasion involved at some level), I see it as problematic as the Roman empire doing the same
TLDR : after the revolution, situation in France was very chaotic
Napoleon brought A LOT of order
(Edit :) How he's portrayed nowadays is heavily tainted by past nationalistic propaganda
> Biggest personal disappointment is that for some reason post-Napoleonic Netherlands decided they needed to be a monarchy
I guess that was part of the prize for foreign support for our independence
(a bit of contradiction eh
Foreign support needed to be independent)
Weren't you also the first modern Republic ? "Modern" as in not Roman
Also, you didn't have a "Dos de Mayo" so I can understand why he doesn't have such a bad rap in your area
> Our 'liberalization' (vassalizing) by the French republic cleaned out that mess
I can believe that
Napoleon, a few Roman Emperors and Mustapha Kemal have probably been the most efficient leaders in History regarding improvements brought to  archaic regimes
Carolus Magnus maybe also
Thanks for the link btw, it was quite an interesting read

I give after-school lessons to kids in a North African family, they're Muslims, but both parents told me that France was gonna be unliveable in a couple years/decades and things were going to shit so fast over the last year

It's funny I had a spanish colleague when I was working in Paris who used to say Joder all the time and I started saying it as well
Actually I'm slightly tilted because it's clearly written "Putain
" but in France, there is a space before !, it should be "Putain !"
Because it's derogatory
But the prostitute meaning is dated, it's pretty much only used in literature now
And like whore in English, the meaning is actually closer to "sexually immoral/filthy"
Anyway, now it can apply to *anything* ("where the whore is my phone charger
Interesting - "ébats"  is a polite  french word translated as "frolicking" by one dictionary, although often the frolicking is in bed

Managing this crazy roundabout is the ultimate test for a french company autonomous vehicle
True story
Link in french
That's because it is not a rotary (giratoire)
It is a real roundabout, or square (place, rond-point)
Different rules apply
Paris is one of the only city in France with no "giratoire". But it is very confusing for people not parisian
The rule for "place" is simple : respect red lights if any (to enter it, or within it, like there are red lights at Bastille), and where there are no red lights, give right of way to people arriving from your right side
So that's the same rule than for any other street
But that means the priority is reversed compared to the rotaries
In a rotary, people already in it have priority, and people wanting to enter have to wait
In a square / real "roundabout", people entering it have the priority
So if sudenly, you are within place de l'Étoile and an avenue at your right has a green light, you have to stop to let people enter
Simple way of behaving on place de l'Étoile: enter it boldy, rushing to the center, knowing you have the priority
If a fucking tourist from you left side already on the square doesn't let you the right of way, honk him and make obscene gestures with you hand
Then once on it, start looking for cars entering from your right, and kindly leave them enter if any
If nobody, you can exit the avenue you wish (don't forget your turn signal)
And yes, there are accidents, but as everybody is freaked out, people are driving slow, so it is barely deadly
(I was a bike messenger for years in Paris, and this square was finally quite easy to ride, a lot of space and people driving slowly
_note : editing linked to /u/LaFlammekueche comment, I inverted "roundabout" and "rotary"_
That goes for most plazas and roundabouts in Paris
It takes forever to go through them
It was designed in an era when cars didn't exist
It's an abomination as far as roundabouts are concerned (like, 4-5 lanes wide ?), but you get used to it
hahaha yes
The people of Paris has always been fiercy and prone to revolution
That's why Louis XIV moved the royal palace to Versailles
The Revolution of 1789 is known as the French Revolution, but we also had major revolutionary episodes in 1830, 1848 and 1871 (some also mention may 1968)
Unfortunately the gentrification put an end to that
When I'll become president of France, I shall change that name into "Place de l'Etoile de la mort" (Death star plaza)
Vote for me !
It's like most big cities nowadays : just don't drive in them
I avoid driving in Paris intra-muros as much as I can, it's just a nightmare
I'd rather take the subway or walk

What's the definition of Pornstar did you use
> women should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, and I agree of course,
>but there is not one good thing about living in a country with disproportionately enormous number of sluts willing to fuck for money
"I'm open minded, but in fact no".
You judge women for using part of their body (vagina) to work for the enjoyment of your little Jhonson
But you have no problem when they use:
* Their vocal cords for the enjoyment of your hears
* their hands to cook for the enjoyment of your tongue
So what's the conclusion
The problem isn't the women's body
It's you and your little jimmy

I'm French, and my opinion is that there's a lot of difference between what people will say (or feel) they'd be ok with those things, and the reactions they'd actually have when faced with those issues
Especially the questions about dating blacks/muslims
Saw this in the mornin & had no idea it would blow up
Still a pretty bad & inaccurate map imho
Asian Muslims aren't so common in Europe
Probably you should read Muslims as Arabs
I have only met one Arab guy that wasn't also Muslim (I live in France), and I've met a lot of Arab people
Islam is very strongly tied to Arab culture, and 99% of the time you wouldn't be wrong calling an Arab guy Muslim instead
Just like most people from Isreal (or with Isreali origins) are called Jews even if they don't practice or follow any Religion
I'm a guy, but I've seen that in France people who claim to be super open minded about that are suddenly less so when their teenage daughter starts dating a black or arab guy
Maybe they have a significant minority I know nothing about

People don't have all information in need to know what is really euro and how euro destructed their purshasing power every where except in germany where ECB is localised so they control it
Euro is just Reichmark with a new name
Common currency without common economic policy can be a mess
And can sometimes means the common currency is handled in a way adapted to the average economical situation of the Union but detrimental to your specific country
I've also seen some economist arguing that some clever combination of a global currency and few local ones for specific purposes could be better for the economy, but it start being outside of my level of understanding
(In some way, this already exists in some countries with "meal tickets" that can be used only to buy food)
Currency is a question of sovereignty; as soon as you will drop your national currency, you will loose the power to freely create/destroy money and fix your currency trade
Having a single currency for so many different national economies is a disaster that southern economies are currently suffering
France is not doing well because the euro is too strong compared to USD
Would it be 20% weaker, our economy would be way more competitive
Personally I see none, but I am not aware of all monetary concerns and geopolitical fallouts
The Banque de France cannot have its own monetary policy and I believe it is a big issue for french democracy
Afterall, finance is shaping the future by directing flow of money in one direction or another
Yes I could see that and it would be a good thing in my opinion
Not soon though because the French public is still pro-EU; despite Frexit being a growing thing
However, I believe Germany is more likely to slowly break apart from Euro as it is holding most of the TARGET2 debts
So if southern countries leave the Euro or are unsolvable, Germany would be left with a very salty bill of debts that are not going to be paid back
Hence its in German interest to leave the monetary union first

Le me, also a BMW driver, reading the comments
*nervous sweating*
Why
yeah i had that bug in gta:sa too
Nice tradition
We should have try that in France
NL would have already add roof and underground bike parkings to clean all of this mess
I need 10 minutes to find my car in the parking lot
I would just give up and wait for spring
No way, our summers are fucking terrifying, let's keep their weather, otherwise I'll just die this time around
I hate heat so god damn much
Holy hell no
Even if I'm living in Savoy and that's kind of a cold region, I really wish we can switch with one of those nordics coutries and get their perma-winter all the year !
And that's the nice kind of American
You also get the less nice kind who's absolutely sure that Sweden is burning and being raped by a horde of Muslims and defend that vision because it arouses them so much
Why isn't rape capital on the list
I wonder what would happen without winter
Because a lot of French people abuse the system during winter where you can't be evicted or have your utilities shut down
You can only go so far below 0 until the bank stops payments
What the fuck guys
Ukraine was part of USSR so, obviously ?
> I wonder if germany had any chance at all of winning the war in the east, maybe it was doomed from the start
The "what if Germany had done stuff differently" replays some people enjoy to do are usually split around two things: what predictable mistakes Germany could have avoided with the informations they had (i.e. "they should probably have avoided opening another front"), and what moves Germany could have made without having reliable information about it (i.e. "if they had attacked this place it was game over")
I believe the consensus about the first category is that it would not have changed the course of the war
When it comes to the second category, the issue is that people fail to realize that this kind of things is down to luck, and when you sum up all the things that could have gone better and the things that could have gone worse, Germany already got *very* lucky
To me, this kind of debate usually boils down to people claiming that, having won second prize at the tombola, it wouldn't have taken much more to get first prize, and therefore, not getting first prize was unlucky
This is not how probabilities work
Is it only at the University of Bogaziçi, other universities like Marmara are also affected

Thank god globalism isn't dead
Another short sighted trade deal that doesn't take into account carbon emissions and doesn't leave space for a carbon tax
The EU is still as oblivious as ever to the main issue of this century
Edit : to those downvoting me, please explain how any trade can be fair when the pollution costs of the goods's country energy mix as well as the pollution cost of transportation are not taken into account ? Or how any trade deal that offloads the cost of carbon pollution on our children and grand children so that we can consume cheaper goods is responsible ?
Yes, this trade deal didn't create the issue of global warming
But it is just another irresponsible move that shows that for the EU, trade is much more important than the climate, outside of some greenwashing here and there
French here, we already are the biggest weebs
We already have that in France
Isn't that in your nature though
I mean im no expert, but it seems a fairly logical statement to say the US has been a keystone in the current international world order
> Let's implement it for Eu products first
Look at the amount of awareness about a carbon tax in this thread and see how many downvotes i get when i remind people of the very inconvenient truth that we are not paying for the pollution of our consumption products, as we should
Do you see a carbon tax happening ?
Let us stop pretending it is not clear cut
Carbon pollution is directly linked to consomption for the overwhelming majority of our goods
Consomption increases when goods are cheap
Trade lowers the cost of goods when pollution is not taken into account
Any counter example you may find about these facts (and you will be hard pressed to find any) is the exception to the rule
Look at the reactions on this thread, all the guys hoping for cheaper electronics or other Japanese products
Do you think people have realized that they get their goods as cheap because of the fossile fuels and that they are increasing the carbon debt to the future generations ? Do you think they *want* a carbon tax that would reduce their purchasing power ?
Yeah, sure
Tells that to the economist or the wall street journal that have endorsed a carbon tax
The Paris accords are more of a framework than a binding agreement
The idea of the accords was to build upon the international cooperation started on this day
But since then, there has been very little momentum going
That's true, but they aren't alone
We in the EU have our fair share of detractors
Wall street journal and the economist, leftist journals
Yeah, you know
nothing about the issue
Maya l'Abeille is some iconic kindergarten shit man, don't sell yourselves short

I saw the two posts, and came straight here to make that same comment
If you're wondering why it's abandoned :
It's on private property, meaning that the municipality doesn't have to take care of it, like most churches in France
The owner, for a reason or another, couldn't or wouldn't maintain it
It's also very recent by France's standards, since it's a neo-gothic chapel from the late 19th century
Although it looks nice and ornate it doesn't hold much historical or cultural significance compared to the hundreds of actual gothic churches from the Middle Ages all around France
C'est ou ?
[toum toum toum]
This is the chapel of "Vic" located in Conques-sur-Orbiel (11600) [here]
More pics [here]

html) //
[another one]
It is on a private property and it seems line it is a recent building (19th century)
It has no historical value and it is better to put money in building that are 500 years old even if thet are less beautiful
Truth be told there is thousands of churches like this in the country
That's why some are not protected
We can afford to lose a few of these
Il dit qu'il voit pas le rapport
Oh, we decided to have an actual separation of Chruch and state 240-ish years ago
Like the one your government was supposed to do, but then some of your rulers decided to sneak it back in a few decades because it looked good to the masses
I dont necessarily want to give away the location of what is essentially a crumbling building, in case some people might want to trespass but it's not the church you linked

> end up as the rest of Western Europe, with most of our big cities being majority muslim
That's the most ignorant and stupid thing I've read today
Only 23 in France ? Maybe it was because I was in Paris back then but I remember being in classes of approximately 30 kids
Village schools probably bringing the average down, especially in la diagonale du vide
Yeah cities probably have not enough schools so we get big classes
I growed up reading Tintin, Asterix, Picsou, Spirou, Blake & Mortimer
I am wondering what are the reference for the kids these days ... ?
Am French
Read all of the albums I think
Such a great parody of our country
As a french, I read all of them until the 32nd episode
Vive nos ancètres les gaulois !
Canadian here, my Grade 6 French Teacher loved showing us these, we watched a few movies but the one I really remember was something similar to the 12 Tasks of Hercules
Also when we had independent reading the books were so popular our teacher made a list and every day someone else got to have first pick for books
I'm pretty sure us in france were handed a copy of asterix and obelix + lucky luke
I basicaly live next to their village
There's a really good smoothie/food place in New Delhi called Getafix that is themed off the comics
Also coming from the region the comic is used on (Brittany) they have a special sentimental value
It's a religion in France !
*Tintin, not TinTin ;)
But I agree, those different comics are the best !
>  because of the implied socialism and homosexuality
What the hell ?
[This scene] in one of the cartoons always made me hungry
As a kid in the 90s, we were still reading and watching Astérix, even though the comics and early cartoons were already decades old
Now they're still making new comics (albeit without the original writer), and movies
So don't worry, they're still relevant and read by kids today
At [the end] of "The Twelve Tasks of Asterix" cartoon movie, Caesar retires in a peaceful life with sexy Cleopatra, so it's almost a win
:) *tear*
Edouard Baer does the pompous Parisian bourgeois accent so fucking well
Love that movie, a friend from high school used to be able to do the monologue from memory, too lit for cinema nerds
The one with Cléopâtre was a masterpiece of humor though
Interesting
Seems like countries were relative lower rate of males go for suicide, then relative higher females go for it
I still wonder why women don’t suicide
What is interesting is seeing how most of the attention has been focused on male related social indicator like corporate level or income to estimate social fairness, while living aside things like living happy and not killing yourself
[Sorry but that doesn't appear to be true
You can literally go to a gun range and rent a gun for $50 in the us, no questions asked

Sorry there is little we can do against a terrorist exploding in a Jewish school
To be fair [there are a lot of guns in circulation in Europe]
Is there another one ? Since 2010 I don't recall any appart from this one, yet I see France has two school shootings
100+60+10 :)
I think it's [this one
] No serious injury though
>Toulouse 2012 (Islamist terrorist) : 4 dead (1 teacher, his 2 sons and 1 girl)
1 wounded teen
> Barcelona 2015 (crazy teenager) : 1 teacher dead, 4 injured teachers
> Grasse 2017 (crazy teenager) : 1 teacher wounded, 4 student wounded
Can't deport citizens born in France
yeah, we have a lot less than 1/4 to 1/10 of the school shootings than the US
I think the media attention the shooters get is a big part of the problem
I must have been living under a rock last year, I completely forgot this one
Nah, just a fact and a reasonable rule
The simple fact I'm born French makes me happy
Luck of the draw and all that
I live 70 miles from here and had never even heard of it
Funny thing is, I grew up near here in a town called [Lectoure] and didn't realize how beautiful it was until i moved away, i just thought it was normal
It's facing downhill
Clearly it was bought at the top of the village in 1980 and has been slowly making its way downwards since
Different town, but same feeling
I moved to the U.S few years ago, and everytime I go home I am in awe by how beautiful it is, yet my whole life I thought it was normal
Very likely as well
Unsurprisingly UN Security Council members are involved in more wars
Misleading colors schemes
Belarus was part of the USSR during the Soviet-Afghan war ... so they have participated to at least 1 war
These kind of maps never lead to any kind of good discussion in the comments

US Congress and Palace of Westminster are definitely fake historicity
When they were built, yes definitely, but not anymore
Westminster will become true historicity in few centuries if still there
If you're surprised that being historical is kind of relative to how ancient it is, just open a dictionary
A Disney castle built yesterday is definitely not historical
If still largely unchanged in more than 3-4 centuries, it will become historical

Good luck Germany from France ! We need your sound leadership in those troubled times
Let's not talk about the coal and oil plants they re-opened because they abruptly closed all nuclear plants
Do you have a link when you can see when each country will have its turn please ?
Yes, I can safely say that our neighbors from the east are our best allies
Wir lieben sie !
A scientific paper released in 2019 found that the German nuclear shutdown led to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions around 36
2 megatons per year, and killed 1100 people a year through increased air pollution
As they shut down nuclear power, Germany made heavy investments in renewable energy, but those same investments could have "cut much deeper into fossil fuel energy" if the nuclear generation had still been online

Thank you !
You can take any North/West European country, and compared to the 200 or so countries in the rest of the world, things are quite good - not only in an economic sense, but in social rights, education and whatnot
In my experience, only uneducated people have curious preconceptions about Germany
However, it is true that outside Alsace, people don't dig much about Germany or study the language
Our second language in school is usually Spanish
In the PACA region it can also be italian
German is mostly studied near the border
Yes
there are no coal plants opening in Germany
There are also no war in Ba-Sing-Se
Way to nitpick
An European western country even still having coal mines today is a disgrace
Closing nuclear plants before coal plants is just conceding to fear instead of thinking rationally

I take offense at the size of France
It doesn't even include my homeland Brittany

/s I'm not really offended though, just a bit disappointed
Wait you used Germany when France is literally the shape of a torso/t-shirt
And France is the one that's been at war with everyone else and also been allied to all their former enemies at one point or another
Without my forefathers, Europe would have turned out very differently
OMG, I mean I know, obviously, that different countries/cities are named differently in different languages, but Lontoo cracked me up
In france we have a region called Auvergne, shaped like a dick with 2 ballz
might be a little too small for Europe Man, he would have to compensate buy having a Big SUV
Yeah, if some shit happened in Europe during the past millennium, you can bet your ass that France was involved one way or the other
Either directly, or backing, openly or secretly the side that suited them the best
They were not always major actors, but almost always were pulling some strings one way or another
Usually to piss off the English or another of their usual partners in war
But then, you have to look at the geographic situation of France: with access to the Mediterranee, the Atlantic and the English channel, borders with the Iberian peninsula, Italy, Switzerland (despite their current neutral state, they used to provide very skilled mercenaries to the highest bidder - already had their lust for money I guess), Germany (formerly the HRE which was also a great power in Europe they had to deal with as well)
All that plus of course our personal nemesis: those pesky people across the channel who've tried holding lands in France since William the Conqueror crossed the channel
And that's not even counting the viking invasions that lasted for a while when France and the British isles became their playground
But then, France occupies a pretty strategic place in Europe and with its leaders not always great people (our last king got shortened by a head by his own people after all) it's no surprise that we've been brewing shit all over the continent, either to defend our precious territories or trying to steal some land or riches from a weaker neighbors
That's just how people rolled back then

Also I consider Trump presidency as a good way to take our independance from our american overlords, as a french I see that as De Gaulle wet dream becoming real
If he doesn't invade another country like Bush and Obama did I would consider him a good US president already
He's destroying nothing, it's only the medias who are talking about it like if it was something big, but it isn't. It's not only about one person, it's about an entire country, you shouldn't listen too much Trump or what the medias are telling you about him and what he supposedly told
And about bad relations, look how we (french) went from 2003 when we refused to take part of the Irak war and were almost seen as US enemies to where we are right now, with still strong friendship between our two countries (and this "bad story" is completly forgotten

Boycotts fall under freedom of speech
That is true for private citizens
The thing is Erdoğan is a head of state, when he calls for a boycott he crosses a fine line and then it becomes a trade war, a completely different beast
You'll note that other head of states of Muslim countries remained very quiet about the boycott for this exact reason
Freedom of speech then if the EU boycotts Turkish products
Isn't this just the follow up ? If I recall all started for Charlie Hebdo because they republish the cartoons while muslim was defying to do so

Why ?
I couldn't understand why France was this way, for example a big part of Aquitaine ( = south west) is rural, with certainly low levels of tertiary education, but it's blue
But I think I have the explanation, the number climbs up to the next level (tertiary) when there are more universities available, thus big cities
So the Paris area = check, same for Nantes+Rennes area, Bordeaux,Toulouse, Marseille, Lyon (going counter clockwise if you are not familiar with France's geography)

The heatmap was in absolute value, not percentage point
Eg in a country A where the average salary is 100 the loss is 50, in a country B where the average salary is 500 the loss is 100
The loss will clearly be worse in country A yet the way the map was made country B is presented as worse off
Your salaries and general cost of life is higher so it meant very little to see Norway in purple in that heatmap

The "both sides" false equivalency bullshit is wrong

Hey don't forget the Soviet
They used 40 000 tones of explosive during Berlin's bombing in April 1945 while the anglo-saxon's air raid spent 65 000 tonnes
Yes you are right, it's a common language abuse
I edited my post
Do non-French people know it ???
Along with Georgia and Armenia, unless they are even emptier than I remember
That was a cool trip !
I wonder in how many (if any) countries are not on top of their own popularity list
>"Not heard of" : 1%
Cunt !
How do 1% of British people haven't heard of France
3% never heard of Ireland and 1% of France , how stupid can you be ?
I'm actually impressed that only 15% of English guys have a negative opinion about France
Why do we care about what the rosbeefs think though ?
They're not even in the union anymore lmao
That's sad somehow because on many streets interviews in Russia you can see they have a positive opinion of UK
But as always western countries persist to see them as eternal foes
I don't think English people are aware that international football was played in 2008
Especially since it will get a temperate climate in 30 years
It feel like there was a roman temple there in the middle, ages ago
Every time I see a Danish officer on a pic, he's smokingly hot
Is that common in Denmark
With time between election being around 5 years, I am always very doubtful of any ambitious plan that go further than that
People saying that they will not replace the power plant that will close in 2029
They have the times to change their mind 25 times
The issue with most renewable is that you barely have any control on the power production (and could overload the grid by accident)
All the other, you can regulate the output, and nuclear is the second best tech for that (after hydroelectric under normal circumstances)
Plus until we can store massive energy, you're bound to have fun if there is no sun or wind
That makes the opening of a new one a very strange endeavour
Anyway that's a good news
It's weird to think I live inside that tiny little nook, like some silverfish inside the a crack in the wall
how/where do you get these pictures ?
I hoped there would be a website where you could select a place and it would render it for you
So basically Finland
For a good one, yes perhaps
For a too efficient one, I'm sure it will be easy
It suffices to see how content is already automatically flagged on YouTube when it contains bits of right holders
Except that with the law as it is now, you won't be able to see that flagged content anymore, even if it the use of content is legal within the country (like the right to parody)
So, if I'm doing a snippet for my friends, like I'm talking to them about what I read, I should have a license ? After all, I'm using copyrighted content
This is my point
For the moment, it's only on webpages, but what's next ? I'm just showing how this is fallacious
News outlets are trying to make money on free advertising, and I'm not sure they will like it when it backfires
Although Assange was arrested while the UK was still a EU member and part of his trial took place while they still were in the EU, the UK hasn't been in the EU since January the 31st of 2020
The judgement about his extradition was rendered last week, so had nothing to do about EU policies regarding extradition
Oh please tell me there is one, I didn't know I wanted this until now

The sign "Brexit" is in fact B.R.E.X.I.T, short version of Beer, Revolver and Ecological Exit, the main party of the Third French King-cracy
Of course, we don't see France because in 2017, both United Democracies of Europe and France were separated by the Calais Portal, a blue shield created by the Society of Nations for prevent Elizabeth III to make sand castles at Utah Beach
Why the political cartoons were so easy back in time ?
If historians lack the context to understand the picture they are probably not very good historians, are they ?

Being an expat, one always gets the same comments over and over
You wanna stop doing something : boom, you're a surrendering monkey
You disagree on something "why don't you go on a strike for it
I mean just try saying you're French on reddit and count how many people will reply "baguette" or "fromage".
In France people who don't care about international politics will still discuss Brexit as in "Haha England is getting fucked, they had it coming"
Not surprising ; many countries probably forgot they're part of the commonwealth
Hey, for once they didn't get the flag upside down
You can take it back tbf
33°C south of Paris today, I was literally melting in my house
Imagine moving from southern France to Scandinavia and thinking "wow, I'm really looking forward to those mild summers !"
Fucking pranked lol, it's the same temperature here, except its unbearable because the arcane technology of AC has not yet reached this remote frontier
No AC and no insulation here
I can't sleep, my head hurts like hell
Some years it gets so bad that it's dangerous to stay in my bedroom (under the roof), I've almost passed out before
I hate it
Fuck climate change and all the rich assholes that let it get worse and worse every year
Take this, Austria
How is it that the temperature in Paris was the same as in Madrid
Climate is wacked
I like that picture of skeletons in inferno
Just buy a fan
This:
It's even worse when you look at the minimum temperatures  last night at 24
3°, Paris was warmer than places in Andalusia, Sicily, Tunisia or Egypt
Personally a good fan does the the work for me, it doesn't cool down the temperature but you get a feeling of freshness
Also closing the windows and shutters during the day is very important to keep the temperature down, not all people do that
Then at night we can open the windows :)
If some people need a good standing fan, I recommend to buy the Klarstein Silent Storm
Very good and silent at the same time, so great for sleeping
You could become a scientist and go spend your arctic summer doing research in the antarctic
Lmao the French are lying
I think it was more like a caged lion
So do you prefer to be a caged lion or a free cat ?
"Oh god oh fuck what have I done
If by caged you mean part of a democratic assembly of nations and by free you mean subject to the influence, politics and diplomatic power of much bigger powers
In the same way your country is bound to its deals and international treaties it signed
I was JUST reading Herodotus TODAY
Wow
Love it !
*happy Holy Roman Empire noises*
>Say what you will about those joyless Protestants, but at least they made sure everyone was literate enough to read the Bible
Good call, you miserable cunts
And now we use our literacy to say *cunt* on internet
Didn't work as planned, hm ?
Wow, I think it's where I'll go in 2 weeks, gf planned all for us
Anything around worth seeing
thanks
I'll check these places
We'll be with my teenager, she's not yet in her "lazy and bored mode" so I feel we'll be able to move around
Didn't think about the Stromboli, but it will surely make souvenirs for my kid
Well, sort of, she've spent a month here:
Technically, it's supposed to be ... France
Cool, if I can get good info ;) any option for 10k running
no, just a nice path with not many cars, I have to train during my vacations
This is a wonderful show of support

First economic power, maybe  yes, but military, no, there is not even an "European army".
Completely absurd
EU doesn't not even have its own army (gladly)
What you say it's not even "potentially" probable
Yes it's absurd
Number is less and less relevant in military power nowadays
Most of the EU countries don't have recent big operations experience, so it will make a bunch of inexperienced troops together
Germany, the power of the EU, has an army in decay
Other countries are not that big military power outside of the three biggest EU countries
So yes, even merged it won't be the biggest military power
Any country can make this law EU has nothing special here
The EU can't do shit
There are days were we get called 4-5 times by scammers
Sometimes, it's just a ping call
Sometimes, my "medical shit" has problems in it
Sometimes, it's a weird, 12-figures numbers ping calling
Sometimes, it's to sell house insulation
The land line is becoming literaly unusable because of scammers
I bet it'll be the same for mobile numbers soon, wait until they get some more exposure
I'm really sorry but i'm fucking done with this shit; i'm buying 3 AC units for my reinforced concrete appartment
I haven't slept properly in 4 nights, i'm completely fucked up right now
It was 34°C in my bedroom at 1:00 in the morning for 3 night straight
When opening the windows, i though i was making a soufflé or something
All glaciers would melt, if there is no change it is predicted to be in between 100/200 years

Duckduckgo is better than Google (edit : **privacy** wise, not search wise) but it still doesn't has its own search engine (yes, it has a crawler but it hasn't been updated in two years according to /r/duckduckgo)
Also, it is US based
I dont think it is better than startpage which is Google through a VPN
While it is far from being perfect, qwant is the only european engine that has its own crawler and search engine (still in development so the current version is a mix of bing and qwant engine, progressively phasing out bing)
I think that if you want to support european independance from the gafam, qwant is the best engine right now
it won't find everything but for 90~95% of your searches, it will be good
What is really missing though is a independant and meanstream european fork of Android
Why not **Qwant** which is a European Search Engine unlike DuckDuckGo based on google ?
From the point of view of the EU, no
From the point of view of the citizens and nations within the EU, I think the power the gafam have is a great threat to our privacy and independence and that we should do our best to limit their influence in our lives
It is not about nationalism, it is fighting back against mega corporations that have proved times and times again that they don't care a bit about privacy and want to be monopolistic
No but it is US based and thus is under US jurisdiction
Since snowden revelations about prism, I don't think it is sufficiently protective of privacy
Also, duckduckgo is not a search engine, it merely combines the results of big corporations own search engines
Thus if you want an independent service (or at least one trying to be) located in a place more respectful of your privavy, there is only qwant that I know
Happy reunification day
This day should also be the occasion to remember that [the reunification had an heavy cost that should not be forgotten]
Germany
They lost two world wars, absorbed East Germany and are still one the most developed country in the world
I don't know how they do that
pissing too many people off with comments : my problem with all that isn't the reunion of germany (people circulating is okay esp in Europe) it was that instead of rising it they pretty much economically destroyed the GDR in turn, declaring that it's currency was worth half of west germany, halved citizens accounts, shorted wages then "privatizing" everything closing much for all for scrap; dismantling the welfare and stable jobs and so on
Germany's still picking up the parts today
I notice the same root in Welsh and Basque
Also it's **erc'h** in Breton, a language closely related to Welsh
That’s a very weird way to say snow in Northern Africa
My girlfriend says Santa Claus must come from Hungary, and when he says "Ho Ho Ho" he means "snow snow snow"!
The orientation of the contrast for Belgium is not right
Nice map :)
Hungarian and Basque always gotta be special, huh
Romanians were secretly Inuit this whole time :O
Because the words used don't come from proto-indo-european languages but from proto-italic languages
Destruction: 100
Too late
My guess is by doing that, Boris Johnson is putting pressure on EU for ultimately obtaining a revised deal
It does have flaws, but more than that, it was the perfect scapegoat, and most politicians have been blaming it for their shortcomings, up to the point where too many people hate the EU for actually weak reasons
Don't miss Slovenia
*bus rise from the river*
*Bismark start to play in the background*
> their politicians take credit for all the positives while projecting their screw ups on the EU
And unfortunately, they are not charged for that
I mean, they are still inside the EU for now
May is a fraud tbh
It's cool but scotland still most beautiful country in the world

I'm Australian and have lived in Berlin, now in France
It hurts how accurate this is
- It's not the being foreign
- It's not the speaking bad French
- It's the not saying "Hi, I am sorry to bother you, can I ask you a question please
Also, foreigners saying this is 100% true, and foreigners saying this is 100% false
It became common because of the English colonies, same for Spanish and French
In most European countries we learn British English in school, not American English
Only CNN hate boobs

I bought my first car 600€. It was younger than me by 2 months
Kept it for 6 years, and I'll never know how far exactly I got it, the speedmeter and the odometer stopped working early on (a little over 220k km)

The regional languages in France were progressively replaced by French from 1789
Only a few are still remaining (mostly those who aren't understandable by a French speaker, like Breton, Basque, Corsican, Alsatian, Francoprovençal etc
) but apparently more than 90% of our regional languages are now dead
You only find them in regional accents
Forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people was a very common thing until the early 2000s. There's now a law requiring consent since 2001, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn forced sterilization still happens
I'd say war against colonised Algeria
It is really a shameful thing involving war crimes, torture, ...
A lot of veterans won't talk about it because of how ashamed they feel
Look it up
France caused the first attack in the history of New Zealand, when it flowed the Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in [1985]
The camps we set up in mainland France during the Algerian war of independence, for 'harkis' (pro-French Algerians)
There were a few, in Rivesaltes, Bias
living conditions were hard, and this event is an important part of the Algerian war
We learn about it in school
Look it up
I mean, you don't become the country with the most battle victory without doing a few shit on the side
We could talk about everything we did during colonisation
We were "only" the second colonial empire behind the British, but we've got nothing to be jealous of
We were as horrible as they were
We could talk about torture and war crimes during the Algeria war, but I always like to remind people that we're the inception of the Vietnam war
Indochina was an old colony of ours composed of nowadays Laos, Cambodia and finally Vietnam
To sum it up quickly, there's been an independence war, we left these country without doing anything to help them organise, and a thing leading to another, Vietnam war kaboom
Murica goes brbr and the French never did anything wrong there AT ALL
Damn just looked it up on google and realised the flag I got as a souvenir from my Vienna trip got the eagle on it
Is that bad
I'm scared I could have offended austrian friends
My father had Kurt Schuschnigg as a professor in university
He used to tell stories about Hitler, and how Hitler wouldn't let anyone smoke
I'd think there were bigger things to worry about, but I guess that was important to him
I'm so glad Occitan was taught in school when I was a kid, and that there were schools where all the classes were given in Occitan
I am so sad I was too dumb to not take any interest in those classes when I was a teenager
I don't realy get why you talk about 1789, it's a weird starting point
The first one to go towards langage uniformisation was François Ier, who did it administratively, so lawer and such
The ones who forced it to the people was the 3rd republic, end of 19th century, 90% of french population was illiterate
Don't get me wrong, yeah the french revolution did some gesture towards it but never realy enforced it significantly
Francoprovençal (or Arpitan) is one of the most endangered language in France
I don't think it will survive
I don't know one people in my region who speaks it
People usually don't even know what is the language originally spoken in the region
Even I, I learnt the existence of Francoprovençal when I was 20 maybe
This is very well documented and R/europe frequently has an attack over it
This ppace will definitely do the exact same
Also a very small minority of french would consider that "dark".
Always nice to hear from the geographically challenged  ;)
(I’m kidding, I do appreciate your addition)
My grand parent had "the potato" at school, if a teacher found a student speaking breton, the teacher would give them the potato, then the student had to find a student that spoke breton and give the potato, at the end of the day, the student who had the potato would get punish
My great grand parent still only spoke breton so my parent do know a bit of breton but mostly some expression, and I know even less than them
It's not a question of tolerance, it's just that at that time our nation had to be united and the first step was to remove the language barrier
Not really, it was more progressive and for me the real turning point to enforce French was during the third Republic in 1881 when Jules Ferry proposed law to make school mandatory and free
From this point the French language everywhere in France take off drastically because this was the only language allowed in schools
I think it's impossible
Apart from an important change in the mentality or a huge increase of regional nationalism those languages will more likely disappear
Young people aren't interested at all in learning their regional language and not a lot of school offer regional language lessons
Except for some maybe that still have a decent of speaker like Breton or Corsican, the others will disappear
J'ai rien compris désolé mais tu peux le dire en français stp
Consent of the person
Until 2001, no consent from the person was required and parents often had full power
The person was left out of it
There's a serious problem with how mental health, intellectual and cognitive disabilities are viewed and treated in France
France is way behind other first world countries in that regard
Every person has a right to make a decision by themselves, even more when safe and non invasive birth control alternatives are possible
You can't deny someone their right to make decisions concerning their own body
The truth is that intellectually disabled people are treated like irresponsible toddlers at best, and like vegetables at worst
In most cases, they're sterilized because their parents view them as perpetual children who don't have a sexuality and shouldn't have one
Many even have been chemically castrated before puberty
What do you call this ? I call this a horrible mutilation
No human being deserves that
Well, forced would be an overstretch
Most UN resolutions regarding decolonization were passed in the 50s and early 60s. Western Sahara was one of the last, with a 2 UN resolutions requiring spain to decoloniza the territory in 1965 and conduct a referendum (I think in 1966)
The Francoist regime didn't want to relinquish control and was still fighting and crushing uprisings by both the Sahrawis and the Moroccan army
It wasn't until 1975 that Spain was seriously considering decolonization, after failing to crush the militia that would form the polisario front
Ironically, it was Morocco that asked the International court to have a say on the matter
It's complicated, but Morocco's government failed to provide concrete evidence to support Morocco's sovereignty before colonization (it's very interesting
At one time, a treaty between Morocco and Spain was discussed, with the Arabic and Spanish versions using different wording that changed the meaning of the text)
Morocco was outraged and held the demonstration famously called the Green March
Spain realized that there is practically no interest for it to be involved, and it signed the Madrid Accords
That's when the shit hit the fan
Yes I got the one headed eagle carrying the tools in his talons
Thanks I had a mini heart attack for a moment :)
Btw awesome country, awesome people, awesome food

Can't wait to go back
Austrian german sounds much softer than high german, that's a cool accent
Hi, are the tools a reference to communism
If so, how do you feel about it
If I recall correctly, that's exactly what it was
We sterilize rapist
Your neighbors south even kill people
>You can't deny someone their right to make decisions concerning their own body
People barely capable to be autonomous should not be in charge of someone with even less autonomy
For the same reason we allow teen pregnancy to be terminated, we allow this form of termination
We have enough people in shitty life conditions already
The one time french and english agree with each other
First, your argument is in favor of birth control, not something as radical as forced sterilization
Second, autonomy varies during someone's life and well compensated disabled people have decent quality of life and many of them have a family they take care of pretty well
Also I've seen far more horrible life conditions due to people who can't access birth control, poverty, dysfunctional families, alcohol and other drugs
Most disabled parents take care of their kids very well, even though it's often harder for them but they still do it
And most of all, it's up to the person to decide
If the person has such a severe mental disability that they shouldn't have kids, they're probably in a hospital room
So there's no need for sterilization or chemical castration
There are far less invasive and safe alternatives in case where controlling hormonal cycles is absolutely necessary
For less severe cases, every person has the right to a sex life
It's  ignorant to assume they can't or won't have one
Spain is currently disliked by Moroccans not exactly for the Western Sahara conflict (the blame is put more on Algeria)
It is disliked because Spain still controls Ceuta and Mellila, as well as a bunch of islands off the coast of Morocco
And also because of how Spain reacts to trade between Morocco and the EU
Thanks
That’s a very good explanation, sorry for my dumb question (and for not checking at least Wikipedia before asking, I should have)
Thank you for the explanation
Sorry for the dumb question
You missed the point
You claim we should leave it up for people to decide
Well, people in jail do not decide for themselves how they dispose of their body
Considering the "mouvement" you should look at the reality of the movement you are talking about
It only exists in your eco chambers
Because you focus on some random detail of my post, you missed the point
I'm discussing the "dark" morality he tries to picture
There are many cases where people do not have the right to dispose of their body
Prisoners and psychiatric cases for example
It's always in the case of protecting a 3rd party
In this case, the 3rd party is potentially the child
The logic is completely sound for the same reason we jail killers
"Disable" doesn't mean anything
If you harm is cut off, you are technically disable, that doesn't prevent you from being perfectly capable
I'm not discussing that
If you are incapable to be autonomous, be it because you're are mentally retarded or highly handicapped, you should not be in charge of a kid and put extra burden on the person taking care of you
>If the person has such a severe mental disability that they shouldn't have kids, they're probably in a hospital room
You have no idea lmao
If you don't get the word "disabled", I'm not here to teach you English
Also there are many disability types : motor, sensory, psychiatric, cognitive, and intellectual, which can be combined
This is intellectual disability I'm talking about and it doesn't necessarily prevent from taking care of a family
It's on a case-by-case basis, and it's also something that needs to be discussed with the concerned person if they experience difficulties
You can't judge someone's capacity to do it without actual knowledge of their difficulties and situation
Also simple birth control is usually preferred, with consented sterilization as a last resort
Forced sterilization goes against human rights and that's precisely why it's now a crime
Most of them actually do have a sex life at some point and they know far more things about sex than you think
Also parents in many cases tend to infantilize their child
Mentally disabled children are statistically the most abused children and this keeps going well into adulthood
Also sterilization is never a first intent birth control and there's no need to use it on someone who refuses to consent to it
You really need to read and learn more about disability and disability rights, because you're obviously one of those people who treat mentally disabled people like children
They're adults and they deserve respect
I don't understand what you're saying
When you're talking about Gibraltar, whose claim to it are you talking about
Morocco's?
If you're talking about Ceuta, its conquest was done in 1415 by Portugal (less than 700 years), and before that it was part of the Marinid sultanate
It was then transferred to the Spanish rule in 1668 by the Treaty of Lisbon
There was no "Moroccan kingdom" then in the same sense that almost every country existing today wasn't what it is now
Spain certainly didn't exist 700 years ago in the technical sense
Anyway, I wasn't even giving arguments
I was saying what people think
A criminal is a person with undesirable trait
Alsox over 60% of the world population lives under death penalty
I think you watch the western world and do not grasp how little we represent
We are not even a billion and a world reaching 8 ones
Forcibly sterilize disabled or taking away the baby at birth is basically the same for the disabled
At the end, they have no kids
It is even worse because they got the struggle and risk of pregnancy and none of the benefits
A push for birth control is just that, a push
If they still want a kid, it will be taken away anyway
The sterilization (or absense of kid ) is the finality in all cases
Also on the jail part, we are very different than North America and we see by your stance USA leaking on you
In europe, The justice system is NEVER a retribution
You dont jail people for what they did
You jail people to make sure they are not a danger to society
If you give a 20 years sentence but by 10 you are certain he wont be a problem he will be out
We are not discussing sterilization of people for the way they are born
We are talking about preventing selfish and dependent people to inflict a life of misery to a potential person that will be a burden on people others than those supposedly responsible of them
You can judge the ability of someone to take care of a child by observing how they take care of themselves
While you can't prevent consenting people from having a kid, you can take the kids away as soon as you are judge incapable to guarantee its safety and basic education (social service are here for that)
Force sterelization is used on people who do not have the mental capacity to control and restrain their sex drive
So the Human right part is just made up
Concerning the "disabled" part, you basically just repeated what I just say
I don't think you have anything to teach anyway
So basically, there's only a need to take a child away if the parents have proven they're experiencing difficulties with the kid
Which in itself has nothing to do with disability or forced sterilization
&#x200B;
>Force sterelization is used on people who do not have the mental  capacity to control and restrain their sex drive
So the Human right  part is just made up
What you're describing here is a pervert
Most intellectually disabled people have no difficulties restraining their sex drive in society just like everyone else
And yes, obviously I need to teach you basics about disabilities as you can't even make the difference between intellectually disabled people and dangerous perverts who need psychiatric hospitalization
It's not compassion
I know them personally, I live with them every day, I even worked with them
I'm even a disabled person myself
I'm in a disability rights association
Attitudes like yours pretend to do these things as kindness but it's actually condescending
And forced surgery destroys lives
Human lives who want a sexuality and a family
They're people just like you and they deserve to be treated as equals
If you're talking only about extremely severely disabled people, they're almost all hospitalized
So they don't need birth control anyway
In case they have hormonal problems, there are treatments for that and sterilization is not just unethical, it's also simply unnecessarily invasive
Most oral treatments can be delivered through IV or simple injections
And it's safe and reversible
My post wasn't talking about extreme cases like vegetative state anyway
I was talking about disabilities such as Down syndrome, cranial trauma and autism
These are the people who have been forcibly sterilized
People who can have a healthy sex life, who did not want to be sterilized and who fully know what was done to them against their will
Sterilization itself doesn't get rid of hormones at all because you don't remove gonads
If gonads are removed, there are some serious side effects, so that's almost never done, and you don't want something irreversible and such an invasive method
In case there are hormonal problems, there are hormonal treatments that can be given orally or through IV
And it's up to the doctors to choose to give them as an appropriate treatment
Yes, I wish the law would be more compassionate to people in vegetative state, terminal disease and extreme suffering
But in a traditionally Catholic country, I don't think progress will be made any time soon
I totally agree with you
I've never seen anyone wanting to allow euthanasia for everyone in real though
I wonder if this is a Reddit thing
Replaced with water
Then luxembourg, it could make a cool lake for Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and ourselves to swim in

France was the first country, in 2016, to make it illegal for supermarkets to throw away food
They have the obligation to donate unsold food to associations
Technically women don't need condoms
Should it be something guys pay from their pocket
Should we have men-only taxes to compensate for the free condoms provided by health agencies
Don't know the specific, but we have something similar in France
He is a coward who let May take the brunt of the post brexit shitstorm alone despite being the literal face of Brexit with Farage
He is also a shitty person in general
I expect him to be terrible for UK and be an idiot who ridiculises his country on the international stage
Not surprised but still disappointed
I was in London last week, I had the same conversation with a journalist/editor from Scotland
I was saying the same thing as you but he told me that first, Johnson is not that stupid and he will make everything to push back a possible Indy ref, moreover he told me that if a referendum was happening now, Sturgeon would lose it, second, he probably won’t last long as a PM
So I was really confused between your point that I see a lot going around and what he told me (he is probably biased of course, this was not a professional conversation)
What do British people thinks about this ? I would really enjoy a conversation about these two opinions
All of the interviews of BoJo are unreal, as in, surreal
I'm still in shock how he was the mayor of London for TWO TERMS
He's too much like Trump and I don't look forward to the days of his name being plastered everywhere .

When some royals tried to escaped, years and years ago
They was in disguise and travelled in a carriage
To thank the coachman, the father of the royal familly, which was the king of France gave him 1 golden Louis
On one the king's face was printed
So the coachman recognized him and because there was a little Revolution, he led him to the guillotine
The end lel
Louis XVI got fucked up
When we spent 20 years preparing a defensive plan and got wrecked in 1 month because of our incompetent chief of army and our allies
Maginot
Ok I agree big oof there
And then that sort of triggered [a whole century of civil wars in Spain] Woopsie daisy
It was impossible to keep
Too large and underpopulated
I genuinely laughed at that
That's a great story, thanks for sharing it
Extreme poverty in France looks like that: [
It is a huge majority of non-French people, usually from countries like Syria or from Romania
There is also extreme poverty within new African migrants, but they usually have their own family/village/regional networks in France that take them in charge, not necessarily under the best conditions but they are not as visible as Roms and warzone migrants
Comment approved
I would just like to mention that not all Romanians are Roms
It is a specific community with a specific way of living
Yes
And it’s currently fucking up my exams
Yet here I am, reading English on Reddit
Just how stupid am I???
Opposite problem: I'm an Anglophone who has lived in France now for seven years
French grammar style has begun to creep into my English
Yes because of differences such as "language" and "langage" or "literally" vs "littéralement" (notice the double letters are not the same)
Leaving with a foreigner and working for an international corporation all in english ... i must admit that my written french requires more auto correct than before
Happened to me some years ago after a long stay in Ireland
At the arrival in France I purchased my train ticket in English at the train station, then for several days I talked to the cashier in English at the supermarket
It took me more than a week to think in French all the time
The same thing happened when I came back from a summer holiday in Québec
I spoke québécois longer than I expected back in Paris
Same for me, I forget the proper French words because I tend to use the English words so much that when I speak in French I just throw them in the conversation
Same, and with German too
A nightmare
The French accent in general, whether it's mine or someone else's, is pretty much torture to my ears
I hate it
I've some of the heaviest french accent ever
Everytime i talk to an american, he burst out in laugh then tell me girls are going to love me
So it's fine i guess ?
I've worked hard on getting rid of my French accent (by practicing an RP accent, basically), now people can tell I'm not a native speaker but can't quite place me
I don't think I'll bother going further than that : I feel that acquiring one particular accent would be a sort of statement that I don't want to make
Also, when I get overly excited while speaking English, the accents I've studied blend together, and I switch accents from one word to the next, which I've been told is the funniest thing, and I don't want to lose that
I don't, I feel stupid
My mind knows how to pronounce the word correctly but my mouth is like "flekzknfn". And I don't have a heavy one
Many french people are ashamed to speak english because here in english class, we almost never speak, and nothing is made (it's the opposite) to make us feel confident
I absolutely don't care but a LOT of people tell me it's sexy
I don't get it but guess I'll take it
The French accent I absolutely hate
It sounds awful to me
Mine is light enough that people mistake it for other accents, so I'm happy about that
I might be alone here but I like mine
I have worked on it, not to sound native but to be as understandable as possible, which is I think the most important part when learning a language
I'm pretty sure no one likes their own accent when speaking a different language
It is similar in France, lots of people are shy about speaking English because they think the accent sounds stupid
This is most likely a result of the French education system which is not great when it comes to foreign languages
While English is taught at an early age, by the time you graduate high school, students are not equal in their skills
Some can speak fluently with a British accent, others can't align 3 words
I started learning English 25 years ago and have been using English professionally for the past 15 and living in an English speaking country for 10
I still have a strong accent and people often ask me to repeat
In my neck of the woods, I even had people answer me in French
I don't really care, this accent is not going away
The only thing I can do is to go to a speech therapist to learn how to pronounce *th*.
I've always heard that English speakers absolutely love the French accent but almost every French people I've met feel uneasy when they speak English because of it
Plus, I was also told at school that having an accent might sometimes make you hard to understand or lead to confusions (we don't have long sounds in French so there might confusions between  ship/sheep, beach/bitch etc)
I don't. I've worked very hard to try and get as close as possible to a perfect English accent, a pointless task I know, because it makes me ashamed when people make fun of me for it
It’s shit , but I started to learn English 4 years ago in 5th grade , so I think I have the time to make it better !
I sincerely dislike the French accent, I think it sounds like a speech impediment
I worked very hard to get rid of it and to have a more standard southern British accent, I think it gives me a lot more credibility than the French accent
My favourite English accents are Dutch, German and Swedish I just like the way they pronounce things, I find it adorable
In General I do not like my French accent
It's cool as an ice breaker from time to time but in professional environment I would rather blend in with my peers
However I remember one specific time I was happy about my accent: I was playing cards against humanity with my suitemates in the USA and I had to read the card:
"***But before I kill you, Mr
Bond, I must show you\_\_\_\_\_\_"***
Everybody laughed and said my accent was perfect to read this card and the answers
My personal accent is different from the typical French accent
And I hate it that I can’t pronounce English Rs correctly in several words
Yes
My secret ? I just keep an huge french accent when talking english
It's funny how much it's bed lmao
I like the German accent a lot, actually
It's very soft and ever so slightly high pitched
The comedy German accent you hear in movies and on TV sounds awful, but it is not at all what the actual accent sounds like in the real world
I am exactly like you, except I'm French
I'm embarassed by my accent
And the occasions to speak English are very rare
What does a strong Danish accent sound like in English
The only one I've ever heard is from South Park where the hunt internet trolls, but I doubt that's very accurate
The only Danish actor I know of (Nickolaj Coster Waldau) can pass as a native English speaker easily
Oh god, my accent is absolutely terrible
And I hate it when people mention it after me speaking just 3 words
And I did work 6 month in Denmark, with the working language being English
People saying "french accent is cute" never heard me speaking :/
There's about 4 million English accents, so it'd be quite interesting to hear what yours is like and how you feel about it
Man our linguistic politics sucks *so much* it is tiring at time to argue with people even when you've got arguments and science on your side
Not give a fuck about what anyone thinks (very hard to do I'll admit) and try to do your best
I've never been mocked for having a good English accent, ever
On the contrary
Speak faster
Hahaha I have a Swiss uncle and I don't notice it that much now, but it's less noticeable than the Belgian one
Why do you want to get rid of it
It's not attractive when you can't get what I'm trying to say x)
I still remember when I wanted to say "happiness", and everybody around a table looked at me weirdly
They all though I said "a penis", which didn't fit in the conversation ...
Trust me, among french, my accent is VERY thick
It's a tad difficult to explain, especially in English
But basically we can sum it up to some major points/issues:
First, there's a fear of evolution, or some sort of puritanism in our language
People have a tough time understanding that French is a LIVING language and that it is normal that it is still evolving
Everytime someone proposed a reform of the language or its spelling, every person who can speak went mad because "WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE, IT'S NOT EVOLUTION, IT'S DOWNVOLUTION, MOLIERE WOULD ROLL IN HIS GRAVE (that's a French idiom) HOW CAN YOU, HOW DARE YOU". Except that most of the time none of these people have any basic linguistic knowledge and shit on things they don't know
L'académie Française doesn't help either
It's a bunch of grumpy white old dudes with - again - no linguistic background that think they are the ones saying how the language is supposed to be spoken/written
BUT:
1/ you can't tell people *how* to speak
Again, living language, what is spoken becomes the new rule etc
2/ they have no official power endorsing this
Like, they litteraly have no official powers nor duties
All they are supposed to do is edit a dictionary, which they haven't done for nearly a century now
Then, we basically killed our regional languages
Our relationship towards our language is deeply linked to what we call "le roman national", which means the national novel
Basically it is a romanticise history of our nation, mostly false and full of symbolism etc
And the langue is one of its core
French is the only official language of our country
One Langue for one people
It was thought that we wouldn't feel as one of there was many different languages and that people wouldn't feel United and there wouldn't be such a strong patriotism
I'm making short cuts but you have the idea
The result of this thinking is us abandoning the teaching and speaking of regional languages such as Breton, Corse, Occitan etc
People who were speaking it where shame for it at school and in there day to day life
Therefore they stopped speaking it and only used French
Also you couldn't learn it in school, and you still can't most of the time
If you want to, you gotta go to some specific organisation and it's a real pain in the ass
And with all that, French people still have a weird relationship with the French language
It is one of the only language where you'll see native speaker ALWAYS make remarks to other native speakers because what they said was wrong/weird etc
It's also a difficult language to learn because, whereas in English if you do some mistakes, nobody will bat an eye and everyone will be "completely understandable, you're learning, have a good day", French people will *always* emphasise on your mistakes etc
Also most of French do not like it when tourist can't speak a word of French
But, like, man THEY'RE FUCKING DUTCH OF COURSE THEY DON'T SPEAK FRENCH YOU INSUFFERABLE CUNT
Sorry, my own people trigger me a bit
If you can speak French I can't recommend you Linguisticae's YouTube channel enough
If you don't speak french, I think there are English subs :D
(It's already a pretty long post and it is still just a summary of numerous problem)
Edit: I just saw that I didn't answered your question about accent
Yes and no
As every country comes stereotypes depending on where you live
So someone coming from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be seen as someone fucking his sister
So if you have this accent you can be mocked some time
Southern accent are also mocked sometimes as the accent toulousain
But it's more of a job problem
If you wanna be a journalist and work in TV or Radio, you'll have to change your accent to a Parisian one
It is seen as the default accent, and you just won't find the work you want if you're adamant at keeping your native accent
They are seen as less professional, more rednecky in a way
But in the same time people with strong and recognisable accent are proud of them
Don't ever ask someone from Marseille to drop their accent
You'll most likely end with an AK-47 aimed at you
Edit 2: if [that's] not the best exemple of how defensive some can feel towards our language
Haha, true
Well, I did an internship abroad, and the company put all of their intern (very international community) in the same group of flat
So I had friends from everywhere, it was nice
I had no trouble to get everyone when they spoke English EXCEPT for the British x)
The hardest thing when I speak with foreigners, is for them to actually get my name right
It's frustrating, because my name is overly simple
It's "Loïc" (basically, you have to pronounce every letters
You see the word LOgarithmIC ? Well, you take the 2 first letters, the 2 last letter, and you're good)
For some reason, people hear "louich", and they do not now that name, so they go with "Luigi" somehow
It is a true mystery to me x)
> I hope it survives
Oh my sweet summer child, who are you, thee that are so pure of heart
> This change is seen as good in France
Well, not by our linguists
Scientists, because yes my fellow Frenchmen who might read this comment, linguistic is a science, are making the same analysis, and they don't think it is a good thing
But Jean-Pierre who's always been told that speaking a "proper" French is speaking it this way and not that way, and that French should never change ever again won't hear it the same way
People need to understand that a language that does not evolve anymore is a dead one
And no, Molière won't be pissed because we're changing our language, just because he himself was not speaking the same French as we do
For fuck sake is it this complicated to understand
I mean, have you seen the screen I've linked
It is frightening to see such behaviour in 2020
We sanctify our language, and we make it something it isn't.
I would say "low-ick", but I wouldn't mind the other one
I think I will reuse that to explain how to pronounce my name x)
Well, with colleagues, they usually finish by getting it right
But you know, each time I meet new people, I have to explain again
And sometimes I just give up (I'm looking at you, Starbucks)
Apple, like many other companies applies the 1$ = 1£ exchange rate ... Apple becomes too expensive
Also apple in the last 4 years is just following the trend not being a pacesetter anymore, so the extra cost becomes less and less acceptable
The fact that Whatsapp is also now heavilly used makes that you can use what you want
&#x200B;
Finally, yes Android is less polished than IOS, but it's still quite good for the price and more advanced (for geeks)
A bit late but I didn't see lots of comments mentionning one point: phones are more expensive in Europe than in the US
When you take into consideration conversion rates, you can add roughly 15% of the price to buy the same phone in Europe because of VAT
As a result, iPhone and top Android phones are even more overpriced for the value and people tend to buy more affordable phones
So more Android phones are being sold as before the new iPhone SE Apple wasn't selling anything in the "cheaper" market segments
Well here iPhones are viewed negatively, at least in my circles
It cost way too much without anything more than another brand
Phones like Google Pixels and OnePlus are getting more and more popular, alongside Huawei
The only people I see with iPhones are either older or see it as a status thing because they are into the whole American Dream from reality TV
I agree at 100% and it always bothers me when I see overpriced simple things even though you can have the same one for ⅛ of the price like Balenciaga or Louis Vuitton
Marseille could be one of the most beautiful coast cities of Europe, and home to the most beautiful beaches in France and instead it's a trash covered ,drug infested criminal playground that gets worse and worse every year
Marseille I would say, it smells bad, it is reputed for its criminality, they sometimes have whole building randomly collapsing out of disrepair and they have had political corruption problems for as long as I remember
Marseille definitely but the whole of Pas de Calais as well
Paris, no contest
The highest density of assholes par m2
And I live near Paris
I honestly think Paris
It's supposed to be our capital city, a city of love
but it just stinks like pee and pollution
1- North Marseilles, North & South west Paris suburbs
Beside the obvious ugliness of the quick & cheaply made buildings, those cities are the physical representation of Post colonialist France
They are where we parked to die those we used and abused to rebuilt our country
Now they serve as scapegoat by far right (all over the world) to label and blame Muslim as "trouble". It is to me the biggest failure of our last 50 years
2 - Béziers, Hayange, Fréjus, Hénin-Beaumont
Those city elected Far right politicien
They are a tumor
3 - Paris for many reasons but mainly losing it's soul
4 - All new cities built on the American model
Made for car, not people
Ok, I'm almost a month late know but seeing all my fellow frog talk about Marseille made me think of somewhere way worse in my opinion
Behold: the wet and gloomy grey Belfort
It north-east, and the only thing to save is their choucroute
It's grey as fuck, it's cold as hell (pun intended) the rain would make London blush, AND CAN WE TAKE JUST A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THEIR FUCKING ACCENT
Also it's a bastion for the FN and the far right in general
Nothing to save there
Franchement j’aurais d’abord pensé à Charleville-Meziere
Mais est-ce que c’est une ville (nombre d’habitants) ?
To be fair, the drug scene isn't worst than other big cities, it's just that the media only talk about Marseille
Paris is just the same, Givors in a much smaller way is the same etc
But for a reason we only ever hear a thing about Marseille
And it saddens me because it's still a great city
Yeah it's full of trash, but Paris smell of piss
If you look at the city from the Bonne Mère the city is still beautiful
People are cheerful and helpful
To be frank, I would have said Marseille too because it's the general consensus, but I think it's a real shame the way people see the city
Yeah Blackpool
Went there once when I was studying in  England because a friend said it was ugly so as students from abroad we had to go and check
It's ugly
Have you heard about Roubaix ? (I'm from there )
Charleville-Meziere ? If there are enough inhabitants here to call it a city
Let's not forget Saint Etienne
Serbia isn't the poorest country in Europe though
It’s actually a nice city to visit, worth the trip I’d say (but I’m biased)
He's probably from Paris, that's why he chooses Marseille
Everyone else hate Paris more
This a legit opinion and it’s probably pretty close
We should hire one of these guys with highly trained noses that work for perfume manufacturers to decide once and for all
Yeah of course but it’s not really known well enough to be the city France is most ashamed of
They're the Americans of France, to sum it up shortly
And women don't exist ?
The thing is, no one really hate Paris, but the parisians
Fake news, we live on a cylinder
My family is there, though my parents relocated when I was young
Are you
I should actually have known that
Like
It’s written just beside your name
Please act as if you didn’t know I’m dumb
There is no excuse because being late is normal and almost required
If you are really late you incriminate the peripherical road traffic
Strikes
"I couldn't go through this road because of a strike, I was stuck for x amount of time, all the trains were stuck at the train station
" It's not super common, but if there's a strike where you live here's your chance to use it
Traffic jam or accident
Because my city has accidents every day on the freeway
If you live in Paris I guess the usual jokes about la RATP (Paris underground and suburban train) which are either late or in strikes
Otherwise we do not have common excuses
The classic "panne de réveil", which means "alarm clock failure" --> you basically overslept
No excuse because it's even more polite to come a bit late that punctually
And if I'm very late, I say there was a demonstration blocking the road
This, the same is true for Paris
There are some subway lines that are just known for always having problems, just say that it was the 13rd, everybody will understand
If you’re on time, you’ll just be sitting there waiting for everyone else
Because when there's a lot of cars they can't follow the morotbike, but trust me, sometimes you see the morotbike and then a few seconds later you see cops morotbikes and everybody in their car claps in a "cheh" vibe
Lmao do you think he knows what "cheh" means ?
EDIT : For those wondering, "cheh" is an Arabic word that we use a lot in France
It means : "You deserved it
And not only I do not feel empathy for you, I'm also delighted seeing you get what you deserve
Ain't sure of that lol
Doesn’t matter, is on strike anyways
Going by stereotype, we'd be the sales rep
of the company
Because we're just so much better than anyone else (oh man, I hated writing this being French and working in sales
Otherwise probably in administration, asking you for some paperwork, and some more without ever looking at it and telling you you filled it wrong anyway
We’re the union leader
The guy with high responsibilities who hate his Boss
On strike or on smoking break, talking loudly and awkwardly to the pretty and shy Swedish supervisor who'd be looking for a polite way to tell us to fuck off
Three months or one, depending if you're management or not
That's a good idea, spokes person, PR Manager, sounds great too
You can't fire us, we've passed our trial period
We protest instead
I speak english like an american but use British spelling
I was always influenced by American language and culture so I knew English even before started going school so I barely learned it in school so I am all american words I guess
Can't, I sound like a douchebag from L.A :( (/s)
I've seen too much american tv
...This is honestly a good representation of how I speak english
I am never getting out of my house ever again now
I was a 17yo french guy visiting California, I was mostly annoyed by how much people wanted to hug for no reason
I was in San Francisco with my family a few years ago
At some point we stopped in a Hard Rock Cafe and I ordered what I thought would be a small brownie, and I got a probably a dozen of brownies mashed into the biggest cup I’ve ever seen, along with a crap load of ice cream and chocolate on top; even by sharing it with everyone we didn’t finished it, and it was the same everywhere
The size of the meals over there is ridiculous
Also the distance you can travel before finding any sign of life freaked me out a bit at first
The weirdest thing for me were houses
They were, like huge, even in middle class people, with a huge front yard no one used but had to be perfect and tiny tiny backyard for the family
It was just a waste of space for me: you buy a land and use only a small part on it
Why a so big front yard
Also, the lack of privacy, most houses didn't have a fency around their land, you wouldn't see were your land stop and where the neighbours one start and everyone could see in your yard
Then I realized that most american almost spend no time outside, except maybe if they have kids
The last thing were the huge and sometime double
) garage, here there is only one garage (or even none) and it's on the side, a bit hidden, on many american houses it's in the front and the first/only thing you see, wich is ugly
When I was there I was like "aww this house is beautiful
" and they were all like "eww it's old
" in front of olders building
It seams in the US, old is NOT a compliment for architecture
In French you’d say « Monsieur » (sir), « Madame » (mrs), you’d never ever call them by their name !
That's the cultural shock, I don't feel better when strangers hug me
The state  I was were not really hot to be honest, it's was a nice day
But most of the time, when they went outside for "a walk" they were actually going to the mall, or sport events, or shopping or restaurant
They really used they garden, no matter the season, not just the family I was with, but all their friends/neigbours to
Yeah, but I find it less oppressive/invasive to kiss cheek people than to hug them :)
Cheek kisses are pretty depersonalized in France, it's a bit weird when you think about it
I personally find them very awkward unless if it's with good friends, as a genuine mark of appreciation rather than just as a mechanical greeting
Same as with hugs
The governement trashing our Work code in France
Using the coronavirus crisis they failed to prepare and face correctly to take workers rights away and bringing us closer to a police state
Our government didnt do a very great job so far, so the opposition is having a field day because, of course, they would have been way better at protecting the country against the virus
Terrorist attack
Yup and the media just ignores it
That's awful gosh
Have you seen anything about Hungary lately ?
That kind of sums it up
Amazon is closing its warehouses following a justice decision: they were told to limit their activity to essentials only, didn't, put their employees at risk, and were put in front of a judge by a union
The warehouses are closed for 5 days, in order to clean them and put sanitary measures in place
The thread on r/worldnews was bad enough, with people only reading the headline and missing the point, please don't let this nonsense spread it elsewhere
I did
That's horrible
The new "laws" are to answer the emergency that is the Covid-19
Last time we has emergency laws were to answer to terrorist attacks and they then became part of the normal laws even in non-emergency times
So I'd say pretty likely unfortunately
At the moment, it'd centrist globalists but 2022 should decide it
France may actually go far right (Front National which became Rassemblement National has been the first or second biggest party in every national election for the last 19 years
) but I do feel a switch to the left in the population
Will it remain until the election
I'm not sure
Will people realize that what they advocate for has been defended by the far left for years
I unfortunately don't think so
This has more to do with social issues here, so no worries about WW3
(or we won't be the ones responsible)
That one's a minor fo sho'.
Napoléon please come back
Just another change in regime
Medieval edition:
Cunégonde, Radegonde, Brunehilde for women, Odilon, Odo, Aldéric, Raymond, Raoul, Anne (now a women’s name
) for men
20th century edition:
Odile, Jacqueline, Suzanne, Nicole, Chantal for women
Gilbert, Marcel, Gaspard, Denis, André for men
my cast: Aristide (m) and Louison (f)
probably Jean-Jacques, like I don’t know anyone who’s called Jean-Jacques under 65yo
Geertruida ? we have Gertrude in French, and it sounds reeeeally old too
You forgot Godefroy in the medieval edition
That's really funny because in France, double first names are generally seen as very "bourgeois". The complete opposite
Wow that’s interesting
Anne is absolutely never used for men here anymore, and most people don’t even know it used to be a gender neutral name
Yes i have noticed that it comes up in shows sometimes
I noticed they also use those names in the USA, like Simone
It sounds old-fashioned for us
So apparently you guys copied us, but a bit later
True
For full medieval saga effect, add Chrétien, Lancelot, Perceval, Ysengrin, Iseult, Isabeau
Honestly they don't have to be dying out; name your kid this, suggest it as a name, use it for a book character; we can influence society
*Some* first names are seen as bourgeois, but not nearly all of them
The only example I ever saw is Anne de Montmorency
Took them long enough
Feels like right now the world is a big cigarette smoker and now that we're coughing blood, after multiples warnings from our GP, only now we're thinking "Hey perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea to quit cigarette".
This is not to them to decide what countries should do
They wants to decarbonyze european industries but EU have no inudstries
Countries have industries, so they decide for us
When I'm binge watching a show, it's often in the original language so, often English
One day I downloaded the wrong file so the new season was in French and I couldn't understand it at first
It only takes a few seconds to realize that I can in fact understand it perfectly but that's super weird
Yes, I'm not the only one ! Sometimes when I read something I don't even remember if it was in French or English because at some point it made no difference to me
For a while, I even wrote a word in English instead of French and didn't notice until much later
Thanks I forgot the word turnout in French now
I think “我还学中文” (I'm also learning Chinese) would sound more natural  (am a native speaker)
Ah yes we say "taux de participation" in french, no wonder I forgot it
No problem :)
We are the country with [the most timezones in the world] (12), more than Russia and the US (11)
It is also always daytime somewhere in the country, the only or other country for which this is true is the UK
Our longest land border is with Brazil (730km), longer than our border with Spain (623km), even with Andorra included (680km)
In 1801, Napoleon passed a [law on religion] ("Le Concordat") which among other things meant that bishops were appointed by the state
When in 1905, the law on the separation of church and state was passed and officially abolished the Concordat, it did not apply to Alsace-Moselle which had been annexed by Germany in 1870
When the territory was returned in 1919 it was still, and is still to this day under the Concordat
That means the the french president is still the one appointing catholic bishops in Alsace, even today
Our only land border with the Netherlands is in the Carribean, on the island of [Saint Martin/Sint Maarten] France owns the north, while the Netherlands own the south
[Pheasant Island] is an island on a river on the French-Spanish border which changes country every 6 months
It is currently Spanish and will become french on August 1st
France is the country with the most different time zones on earth and is present in every ocean and continent on earth thanks to its islands and regions overseas called DOMTOM (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic, Indian Sea, Oceania, etc
France has the second biggest network of embassies on earth right after
America
France is the most touristic country on earth
In fact, there are more people visiting France every year than people actually living in the country (90 millions tourists, 67 millions inhabitants)
France shares a border with Brasilia
How
Thanks to Guadalupe
More than 20% of the French population is located in one single place which doesn't even represent 10%  of the total French area (Ile-de-France / Paris, which make this region one of the most dense populated region in Europe)
BONUS 6 : We don't wear caps and walk around with our baguette under the arm when we wake up in the morning :)
BONUS 7 : Our country is one of the most rural countries in Europe
In fact, a big part of the French population is located in Paris (result of a thousand year old centralisation in France)
The other people are whether living in the other smaller cities, or in one of the 36 000 villages from our country side
Super interesting thanks !
Wait that highest elevation point
does it mean the country is flat and cycling is easier
Thank you for that one then
I grew up there and luxemburgish is german mixed with french with some dutch sprinkled on top just for taste
The capital is full of remnants of that fortress, awesome to visit and chill around with friends in the spring and summer !
In France this kind of taxes isn't surprising either
I must ride bike there and bother unsuspecting countryside folks into housing me for a night
Would it work
I mean is that kind of hospitality common
I'd love an immersive stay throughout the country
All right thanks !
Wow it appears we have the same dumbfucks
Oh yes ! The great conspiracy by the evil LGBT lobbies to turn all our poor innocent children gay ! The reason why La Manif Pour Tous started
They're all obsessed with those "gender theory" stories
And sex ed books too
Sex ed books are meant to make innocent children gay !
And so many people on Reddit think Europe is some sort of progressive heaven
LOL no
Same thing
This is the reason why assisted suicide is still illegal in France
Catholic lobbyists are powerful in a country that's supposed to be unaffiliated to any religion
The same Catholic lobbyists have been fighting hard against stem cell research as well
Yeah they should all agree on one thing, it gets confusing, am I living in the 4th Reich or in the EUSSR ?
Some sentences stay the same
Maybe I nt'should not have much oversimplify
Perfect
I you love all, my friends European
Maybe that sometimes it would look weird but the structure of sentence French is pretty similar to the structure of sentence English
The two languages have many of things in common
I will do of my best to speak clearly
I hope that the people in this subreddit me understand
Hello , i'm called RonronFaitCaca and my account reddit has 1 year (old) . I you wish a good day
It’s same in French
Almost
I just had to remove the “the”.
We do speak not good English in France although, this is a bit the shame
Now the thing funny is to guess if the Belgians translate from the French or from the Flemish :D
It (would) have been nice if we could all translate a sentence of example, so we can compare the different languages
&#x200B;
Actually "It would have been" translates to "Ça aurait été", so a word disappear here
Not much difference for the second part of the sentence, except the "of" which would translate to "d' " (une phrase d'exemple)
The spanish is more easy and one time that you have already learned the spanish, thé french becomes more easy
> in Romance languages, it comes after
This is not always the case, in French the adjectives can be before and after
If they are "completing" a noun they are before, for example *Un nouveau livre*-> A new book
It can even change the meaning of the sentence *un sacré livre / un livre sacré* (a great book / a holy book)
It depend, if I write like I speak in French it can quickly be messy
Majdnem mindent értettem
Yes, I'm tired of shady governments using big sports events to redeem themselves
And the French football team has a habit to botch one out of every two worldcup, so if we can prevent that it would be great
A boycott would be the right thing to do
But it's pretty unlikely that some teams or company is going to do it on a significant level
However the most hurtful boycott of them all would be if viewers don't watch those games
institutions, corporations, advertisers,... Are still going to spend their money like everything in the world is going well
No one is more relevant than human beings to worry about human rights
An online awareness effort during the WC will definitely help
Yeah, I think we can use your post as a template for more or less every single country
Fucking hell that's depressing
Honestly, the FIFA bribes I don't particularly care about
It's obviously not good, but I just accept that it happens for every World Cup attribution and always has
It should still stop, but it's not something that I feel strongly enough to boycott
&#x200B;
The human rights situation and the conditions in which the infrastructure was built is 100% enough to justify a boycott though
Korea 2002
What a sweet memory
Isn’t there a law in France which prevents boycott based on a state’s politics
(Granted, human rights should not be politics, but I’m not sure we would even be able to boycott it if we’re to be coherent
Hi, born in 1999 here, what happened in 2002
I don't think there's such laws
For the 1980 Olympics in Moscow a lot of nations boycotted the event to protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the French government didn't want to interfere and let the French National Olympic Committee decide
Several federations, Horse Riding, Shooting and Sailing Federations decided to not participate
It was also decided that the French Flag and anthem wouldn't be used, the athlete were there but France wasn't.
There was a similar debate for the boycott of 2008 Olympics in Beijing because of the Chinese occupation of Tibet, Jack Lang for instance was in favor of a complete boycott
More recently Daniel Cohn-Bendit called for a boycott of the 2018 Football World Cup in Russia and there was some talks to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in China
2002 was a disaster : 2 defeats (opening game against Senegal and Denmark) and a draw (Uruguay) with 0 goal, despite having in the team the best scorers for english (Henry), italian (Trezeguet) and french (Cissé) championships
They hit the post 5 times
Zidane was injured a few days before the competition during a useless game against Korea and wasn't able to play the first 2 games
Few months before, Pirès, a very important player in the team was badly injured
You add to this some arrogance (Adidas started to run adds with a 2nd star, players were everywere in the media), impreparation (players were exhausted by the regular season) and lack of games against strong teams
Indeed, as titleholder, France was automatically qualified and only played friendly games during 2 years against weak teams
For example, they lost against Chile, had a draw against Australia and lost to Belgium
[This is what I’m talking about] though I’m not sure it can be used in sports
Oh putain
[The European Court of Human Right actually went against the cassation judgement]
But it's an interesting case-law that could have been applied in this context
On est passés très vite de "On est les champions" à "On est dans l'avion".
I’m glad, actually
Thanks for the info
Interesting indeed, too bad I know so little about law
C'est quand même mieux que "On est dans le bus".
Probably peak “I’m not racist but
”, Nadine Morano once “my best friend is more black than an Arab”
Sibeth Ndiaye, french gouvernement spoke persons, said during this very pandemic “some people don’t know how to put a mask on, I don’t know how to put a mask on”.
That’s just one of many ...
"We couldn't have seen coming nor prevented this crisis" - Our President, after three months of the start of the COVID propagation, and years of protest by the nurses and doctors about the unpreparation of the hospitals because of the lack of government support, and the years of warning by everyone of the ageing population of doctors in rural areas
"Mourir, c'est pas facile" (Dying ain't easy), President in office Nicolas Sarkozy during his speech for the new year's wishes to the national medical personnel
Nicolas Sarkozy said something like " dying is not easy"

neutrinos notoriously interact very little with matter

As far as I remember Suski was the one member of the comission who never heard of Catherine the Great and didn’t understand the man was purposefully making him look like an idiot
His fellow comission members, especially Małgorzata Wassermann were trying so hard not to outright laugh at him
There was also the one time when Suski said in an TV interview that Polish people like to go to Egypt /Tunisia for the holidays, so an airport south of Warsaw would be good for them
And yes, he meant the one and only AIRLINE HUB of Radom
Haaaa Nadine
Sibeth outright said “I will lie for Macron”. It doesn’t get much worse than that
Calling himself a dick, I burst out laughing
Why
What was he trying to say, for any of those
That guy has more than one family
Protests are banned
Can't protest to protest against the protest ban
Why live
Closing bakeries
I need my baguette
Closing the bakeries
And they won't do it because it's considered a bare necessity
Btw I don't know what's worst, that my dad just bought 15 baguettes just in case, or that it was our only panic purchase
Wine shops, bakeries, market's. Basically any place to get food and beverages
Macron speaking like a true socialist, defending the public services and the health workers
No protest, the cafe are closed and so the bakery soon
In France, the public services are the only one working \^\^
[It's in our minds]
And listen to classical music
Nevermind, i tried it once, it's painful and never ending
For real, Macron announced that leaving your home was forbidden and the first thing my father asked was if he can still buys bread every morning
Maybe they realized how this could potentially fuel the illegal market ? This news definitely made street dealers happy
I think you've just been annexed mate
bUT aMenDMeNtS
I don't forget about it because I want to visit
But I forget how far it is
How different from continental Europe it must be (including the UK)
It's like being in a village and there is a guy on his hill far away in the distance
I imagine Iceland as a quiet place where they're minding their own business
Peaceful country, something like that
I wouldn't support it, but wouldn't oppose it either
I would support a big Europe wide high speed rail network
Why wouldn't we after all ? Yet do we have the funds to do it ?
No I wouldn't. High speed rail doesn't even work properly within a country, much less internationally
I don't think I ever traveled internationally on a train
Yeah Hu so about France
We’ve slowly removed the smaller lines for decades now
You basically HAVE to go through Paris and follow the main TGV lines, you can’t really travel around the country by rails
No it's not
Well, unless you like to have your travel canceled because of a strike
There isn't one
I haven't yet seen a rail that is preferable to taking car or plane
I skip to comments from the French, just so I can disagree with them
**Comté ? Really ? How is Roquefort not our best cheese how can you say that ?**
Doesn't mean I don't read the rest though
If there's less than a 100 comments I read everything
Otherwise, just the top ones or my country ones
but I try to read as much as I can
Nah, there aren't many French posters anyway
Depend if I want to answer or not, if I want to answer i'll look for my countrymen in order to not make the same comment, if not, I'll just scroll normally
Usually I try to see if I can find my own country, but it depends on the subject
There, that's the spirit !
Hello br
wait this isn't France
Yes, all the time; either by mail or email
Most of them are made to be provocative tear jerkers, going as far as making the person who read the ad the one responsible for the death of a starving child in a country struck with starvation
It used to make me feel bad, until I discovered how much these NGOs were turning in as profit per year, and their "reserve" money
Yeah, I remember as a kid/teen (kind of stopped watching TV after) in the 90s we had a lot of ads by NGOs about donating money to the poor in Africa
It's a business
I'm not sure that a lot of the donations actually help "poor african kids". I recently spoke with a girl that worked for more than 10 years with charity missions to Africa (from the UN to private charity like Oxfam), and the salary she was getting from those charity was insane, like 30k for a 6 weeks mission
She quitted this job because she said she felt disgusted at some point with how much money was going in those NGOs and how little was actually used to help the poor
Knowing that it makes sense that they make a lot of ads to play on the emotion of people to give money
Showing poor African kids dying of starvation and covered by flies is typical in those ads, and since it's almost all we see from Africa on TV then we're made to think that it's the typical situation there
In France though, we have a lot of people who immigrated from Africa or are descendants of African migrants, so it's almost impossible to have no one in your surroundings/friends who have not been to Africa and will then tell you how life is there in a more realistic way
Kind of true, but right now africa and poor malnurish children, is like 3rd or 4th competing with the swimming immigrant in hijab
- Before that, in number 2, you have néo-nazi eastern country (also named Soroskistan) starting with Austria/Italy and moving east,
- But number 1, is UK and brexit, I'm already stacking equipement for the polish plumbers overthere or else how will the Brit get the water they need for tea that will allow thme to go threw this mess ?
>Whenever I surf the internet, I'm always baffled by the amount of ignorance that exist regarding Ghana and Africa in general
What do you mean ? Is Ghana that different than Norway ? only difference is the specie that eats you alive, polar bear vs lions, no
"Maître d' ". Just, why
How do you even pronounce it in English
That's because it's borrowed from French (the goofy prononciation)
No it's "say-musse"
Hahahaha I always think the person had an accident mid sentence and forgot a word
Stool doesnt mean shit in French
There, just thought you guys needed to know
Not really then
Crèche is before 3yo in France
Then you go to école maternelle
I miss the snowy Winters of before
Now Winters are grey, humid, the ground is mushy, it looks sad
It's like Spring immediately follows Fall
Even now, it should already be freezing at night but night temperatures are like 12°C. That's August night temperatures
I don't mind Christmas stuff in stores though
I like chocolate
I don't know if it's a global trend but here in Paris there are tons of guys between 20 and 30 with Canada Goose heavy parkas as soon as the temps are under 15°. Like they are about to start an expedition to Greenland or Svalbard
In Lisboa ! Wow
I've never been there but given the latitude and the proximity of the ocean, I can't imagine it being cold enough for such protection, even in winter
The elderly are still very resentful against the Germans, but there is a solid Franco-German bond tied after the war so not in the younger generations
Edit: grammar please correct me if you see other mistakes
Edit: Grammar 2
In France, I don't know anyone under 50 years old who ever said anything anti-German, I'm not saying they don't exist, but I never met one
Sure, my grand parents generation on the other hand were very anti-German because they lived through WW2
Generally speaking, I think modern French people admire today's Germany because it's a successful country
Ignorant people here love to hate on Germans, kind of on the same level as Englishmen though
I did meet some Germans while partying in Frankfurt, Mannheim and Berlin and they were the nicest and laid back people even after disclosing that I was French
I had such a great time there
In France, Germans are perceived very differently depending on the age of the person you're talking to
I'd say that people who were born well after the end of WW2 and did not witness its impact firsthand are generally neutral towards Germans
The younger the people, the more likely they are to be enthusiastic about the current Franco-German relationship
Older people however, are still quite resentful towards Germans, understandably so I would say
My grand parents come from Alsace
Their family was forced to abandon their home and everything they had during the Franco-Prussian war because they refused to join the Prussian army against France and wanted to remain French
Their new house was then destroyed in WW1 and my great-grandfather was injured fighting for France
Then, WW2 brought occupation and destruction
Needless to say Germany isn't very popular among the older members of French society
However, I think that even older people have come a long way since then and are more likely to be scornful and distrustful towards Germany than actually mean to German people themselves
The typical "we don't like this group for this reason but you, as a person from that group, are different from the rest" your slavic friends have a shit attitude, sorry
But to answer your question, I come from a part of France that used to be German and I've heard that certain people in the countryside still kept a bit of a grudge against the Germans because of occupation during WW2
Most people kind of got over it though
Older generations can be very mistrustful
But since younger generations are very pro Europe, I think it's safe to say Germany is a close friend
Amongst the younger generations
Not really
Germany is seen like a different country now and their willingness to address their history is widely commended
They’re one of, if not the most, respected countries in Europe/EU now
To older generations, in France there is sometimes still resentment but not really in the UK that I’ve noticed, it’s mostly just for humour
I’m Jewish though and amongst my community
well we recognise that the culture of Germany has changed massively but it’s still a source of immense discomfort to be in the place where such atrocities happened
I have enjoyed travelling through Germany and felt safe and respected amongst the German people (although not necessarily amongst all of the immigrant Muslim population who often have a different view of Jews and I have received abuse) being openly and identifiably Jewish
Even so, sometimes it hurts my heart to know of so much suffering so recently
My adoptive grandma is from Berlin and still I cannot visit where she lived because she still suffers so tremendously and endured so many unthinkable things
I have tried, but I felt sick and obviously I know and support that life must go on but to be surrounded by normal life as though nothing happened was really difficult for me
I guess it’s different when we have personal history like that
Also, some old people are very pro-Europe _because_ of the past
My grandparents, who were born in the 1920s, both felt the need for a strong Europe and had no prejudice against German citizens: they knew what resentment had done after WW1 and did not want to repeat the same mistake
But I do recognize that both of them used the term “boche” (pejorative slang for “German”) quite often
That seemed natural to them
And they were neutral rather than enthusiastic when it came to Germany
We have them in France as well they're used to warn people of disasters they're tested every first Wednesday of the month a 12:00
That's interesting
Having lived 15 years in London I don't think I ever heard a Brit mention Germany (including at work events) without making a veiled or overt nazi reference/joke within the next few minutes
You see that even in the financial press
There seems to be a perception that Germans are a different kind of human, somewhat robot-like
I mean, do they know that the nazis planned to kill the Slovenes so "Germans" could settle there
Not sure if things would be in order, but they would not be there to find out
That's my experience too, having spent 15 years in London, although I'd put the line somewhere in the mid-80s rather than 1960
There seems to be a very big generational divide in terms of attitude towards foreigners in the UK, not just Germans
"Boche" is still heard among younger generations because their grandparents taught them
How dare you
You're the little brother, youngster born in 1871
I don’t see where the French are insulting in the video though, there are pretty much describing themselves as lazy and saying the Germans are more serious
Edit: The only guy saying he doesn’t like Germans is from Belgium, and that’s even the very first thing he says
I don't know
Here this is not the case
Please tell me this happened in the 1950s.
That's very cool, cheers
I’m 20 and I’ve never heard it
I was taught it’s insulting
I know that’s what people say, but from an outsider’s perspective, it doesn’t really come across as banter, more institutionalised bullying
Ofc it is but yknow how we work
That annoying little brother that always do better than you in everything but you love anyway
Paris is not real
It's in another dimension
When in doubt, blame us for everything please, we never get tired of this, really
I first thought Maggi was german, when it's actually swiss (and the name is of italian origin)
I thought for a long time that Total and Orange were British
My bad, they're French
I also thought that Ubisoft was American, turns out it's French too
I'm very bad at localizing brands
Here are few that surprised me :
- Ubisoft is French
- Nestlé is from Switzerland and not France
- Bugatti is not Italian but French
Ubisoft is French, not Canadian, even if their biggest studio is in Montreal
Me too
It's the same for Ubisoft (assassin's creeds, far cry etc)
Most of the population don't know it's french
It's owned by Coke, so it kind of is
Only thing i knew them for initially was their soy-sauce-but-for-white-people, but i guess they're huge sellers of instant noodle in southern asia
Wikipedia says they at one point held 90% of the market share in india, which sounds pretty big
Sure, but that's not where Julius Maggi was from : he grew up in Basel, in German-speaking Switzerland
His father on the other hand emigrated from Lombardy
[It's not Canadian]
Plot twist, they are not
It's true
And you invented the double-frieds french fries recipe
Yep, they have studios in Montpellier (France), Montréal, Milan, Atlanta, Paris, London, Berlin, Rotterdam, helsinki etc
It's an international company
&#x200B;
And it doesn't change the fact it's french
Yep, they have studios in Montpellier (France), Montréal, Milan, Atlanta, Paris, London, Berlin, Rotterdam, helsinki etc
It's an international company
TLDR: French fries are not actually belgian
The source of this common mistake is a 1871 writing but it talks about slices of potato fried in butter
Not french fries at all
The recipe is french, according to a food specialist from Liège
To be fair for a few of the stories they are actually french (Belle is one I’m 100% sure of)
They do but I thought Disney was french also because of that
No but there is a certainty that you are salty
BAHAHAH alors là c'est fantastique
Très bonne blague !
More like the courtois type then !
Thibaut Courtois was salty during the world Cup
[Link]
Thibault Courtois, Belgium's goalkeeper and saltiest person on earth
Yeah he was very salty about that, to a point he became a meme in France
This would be nice because it would help poor people better and maybe help people to spare money to pay the expansive studies but if I remember well Bernie Sanders attend to make studies free
Convincing the average American people that universal healthcare is somehow a bad thing for them is probably the most amazing marketing scam success ever
They literally convinced people that selling your house to get the treatment you need is normal and good
I was thinking about that yesterday and as a European I have a serious question
What is the plan regarding the COST of healthcare in US ? We have universal healthcare in Europe but for exemple even if you are not covered an X-Ray is like 50€. In the US it seems like  it can go up to thousands of $. If the US adopt universal healthcare but the prices don't change I just don't see how it could work, the amount of money needed would be insane
I am really not sure about this one
If you travel for tourism sure, but I moved from France to the Netherlands and had to apply for healthcare there
That's what I expect but to me looks like a really big change to the system, even bigger than just universal Healthcare one
But it's not like I see any other way to do it
Super common, only water I buy bottled is sparkling because I love myself a nice fresh San Pellegrino on a hot day
Otherwise I only drink tap water
Tap water for me too her in France, never had to complain about any kind of bad taste to it, and since I try to be Eco-friendly, I prefer not buying plastic bottles :)
It is very common to do that in France, although I know in some region you should avoid doing that because of seaweed
Other story, when I went to Germany about 3 years ago, I was quite surprised when they gave me bottles of sparkling water, the tap water was ok but apparently they just prefer sparkling water, found that quite funny
I avoid as much as possible to drink tap water as underground pipes suffer from corrosion
Also it tastes weird, like metal-ish
I don't mind buying buttles as it's a normal habit for me and around me
I'd say it's probably half and half
I used to work in a suoermarket and i saw bottled water sell an awful lot
We also have so many different bottled water marketed for all segments of people: Mont Roucous for babies, Evian for kids, Contrex and Courmayeur for women watching their weight, Hepar for people with digestion problems and so on
Special mention for cristalline which is an ulbrella brand for lots of sources across the country and the cheapest option everywhere (under 0,10€ per bottle)
And also if you ask for tap water at a restaurant in Italy they can refuse
In France they legaly need to provide that
That would depend on where you're from though
I had a few friends in some small city in the Loir et Cher who didn't drank the tap water because it wasn't adviced
I also had a fair amount of friends in Bretagne who don't drink tap water because of the nitrates (IDK if that's still a problem there though)
And my GF tends to avoid tap water
Like, until we moved in together, she would find it weird that I drink it rather than bottled water (she even thought it was pricier to drink tap water .-.)
In France, I only knew two friends who had what we call an "american fridge" (with a water and ice dispenser)
It's not that common here
As for the filtring pitcher, it's more common to see them
Especially in areas where there are a lot of farming (nitrate contamination) or with a lot of calcite in the tap water (it's not a problem for the health to have calcite, but in those areas, a lot of people uses water softener which is believed to cause potential health issue)
I do have a Brita filtering
hum
jug ? Bottle water is more expensive than tap water, but tap water can contain very small amount of lead, chlorine, sediment or other heavy metals
Hence why I decided (quite recently) to buy a Brita
Only rich people have “American refrigerators” but most people I know use Brita filters or similar at home
Where I’m from the water tastes of calcium which many people don’t like
I prefer it like that (so does my dog
) but my family insist on filtering it
>France had mixed(Paris had horrific water, but Gaillac/Toulouse had decent water)
Strange, I've been drinking the Paris water for many years and I never noticed a difference with other places, nor have I heard it qualified as horrific before
It's possible that there was a problem with your sink, or the plumbing of the building you were staying at
I was also told that myth but it’s actually fine
Most people just don’t enjoy the mineral content in the water but I personally love it
London water is my favourite tap water (unless you’re making tea and it forms some kind of scum on the top)
I’m in Manchester currently and the “corporation pop” (as old people love to call it) just tastes of chlorine and sadness
Why does evil always taste the best
I don't know how this is really happening, but apparently some seaweed are making toxic gas which are infiltrating the ground, and it manages to get into the water distribution system
It only happens in some moment of the year, and some effort have been made since some years now to avoid this
They actually call them names like Dylan, Steve, Brian and such, and usually they are people who are drunk on US/British/Australian soap operas, sitcoms
As such, it's very telling of your social class to be named with an Anglo firstname in this country
People assume you're automatically coming from the working class and your parents aren't very educated because they don't do much else than watch TV
&#x200B;
Interestingly, I noticed some of the same trend in the US, especially in poor black communities where people will be given French names like Antoine or Andre, or invented French names who don't really exist but sound kind of French
[This] says otherwise
Pretty often
Some English words have no literal translation in French, such as "creepy" or (love) "crush". I have to resort to approximate translations or changing the sentence to translate accurately
Almost never happened to me
But now I'm required to learn about 150 new words of english every weeks
So I learn words in english that I don't even know in french
It used to happen from time to time, but with regular reading it disappeared very quickly
Anglicisms are not appreciated here, we have to be careful \^\^
Not that often, thankfully
Maybe I'll struggle on a super specific word for 10 seconds before remembering it (my luck is that English is very close to French)
Pretty often to be honest
And it is frustrating but it is also a sign that I am pretty good in english so it makes me happy
All the time
I’m currently looking for the French word for sunflower (I don’t want to look it up, I want to remember it
it’s frustrating and I’m an idiot)
It happen rarely because I'm not fluent and don't use english in my everyday life, but it can happen like 3 to 4 time per month
I use english words instead of french words more often but I quickly correct me
I don't forget the french word
Oh yeah it happens a lot, especially if I just got out of Youtube or Reddit (It's often in English)
Luckily both my parents understand English quite well so I just say the word in English
It happens less when I'm in school though
... tournesol
Oui ! Haha, merci
In France: not saying hello to the shopkeeper/ the other clients in small shops
This is particularly true in smaller cities
I've seen many tourists forget to do this and they usually end up receiving poor customer service
Not saying hello, please, goodbye, to waiters, salespeople,  assuming that people will appreciate it when you charge like a truck speaking in English, and don’t underestimate the bickering a region can have against another one
In France, you do not want to denounce anyone to the police or their relatives if they did something illegal or bad (except when it is threatening to others)
This is called "Délation" and people see it as something really really despicable since the 40's.
Not only small town, my wife got into a huge fight about that with a security hard at the galleries Lafayette

Anyone know if it’s like this in the UK
My housemate’s mother died and all of my other housemates (half of them Irish) went to the funeral but I didn’t know if I was meant to
I thought it’d be really disrespectful to go to someone’s funeral that I didn’t know and, idk, watch a bunch of strangers be sad
I’m still really worried because I don’t know if I committed an enormous faux pas
I went on a date with someone who didn’t thank the bus driver
nope, that’s the end of that relationship
Same in Australia
Driver always gets a thank you, regardless of how terrible a driver he was
Well, unless they start first
I found that was the most common topic of conversation with tourists
Paris vs the rest of the country comes to mind (while it's fun to joke about Parisians, the "having to move to Paris to have the best career in your field" mentality/reality is awful)
Don’t eat carbonara in France
Even some Frenchmen put mushrooms in carbonara
Is it really different in Belgium ?
I was grocery shopping once and asked help to a store employer
Hé was kind of busy and i tried thrice to get his attention before hé noticed me
I did Say "bonjour" l'oud and clear three times but he didn't here it
He cut me off mid sentence with a Big "bonjour" and eye contact, visibly pissed at me for my lack of basic education
That is something that i don't think would ever happen to a customer in the US, at least from what Reddit taught me
In south America (more specifically Peru) you can enter a shop, say "I want this"  , pay and leave
All this without saying hello, thank you or goodbye
It enraged me at first, shopkeeper would never return my "hellos". But well, when in Rome
Fr, I saw this kind of scenes more than once, and not even between French and foreigners but also between French people who lack politeness (from a French point of view of course)
Well, it certainly seems normal to me but I have noticed (mostly in the UK and in the US but also in some Asian countries) that people don't really greet the shopkeeper or if they do, it's a mumbled "hi" without eye contact
Again, it varies from place to place (in England, people are likely to greet each other a lot in small villages for exemple)
However, I feel that greeting the other clients when entering a shop is a specifically French thing to do
It's because it's considered rude if you don't say hello to people you talk to
Advice : if someone says hello to you, always say hello as well, no matter of you are busy or late
And finally someone from my city :o
Celebrating his life as it should be
I'm guessing that maybe be because national patriotism is really frown upon because of history, so people take pride more locally instead
Is having bad psoriasis a bad excuse
> A: No, I mean "Holland
" I'm not going to fucking Brabant
This is the correct answer
Exactly this is the biggest feud that all regions can unite against, I’m also thinking of Bretagne and normandy, Lorraine and Alsace
While exaggerated, this is kind of true, parisians have it easy with probably every possible careers reunited in a single city, and all the universities around
The region of Paris is also one of the main reasons regional dialects and accents disappeared, so for me it’s just one more reasons to not like them
In lots of countries it's something disrespectful, but in France, it's REALLY REALLY something you should try to avoid
When in Vienna I was surprised how manners there mirror Parisian manners
The protocol is very similar, and I got amazing service while all my English buddies complained about the horrible Austrians
That's not my experience at all, especially if you're Western
On the contrary, they're super chatty
Maybe it depends who the shop keeper is
Yeah, I think you’re on to something but also I feel weird on the Tube because I’m a young woman and often older men seem offended when I offer my seat like “heavens no, I couldn’t take a seat from a *lady*”, idk it’s awkward
"Hup Holland Hup"?
>	Honestly, we’ve lost all hope with the french
Don’t go to /r/food it’s worst than French version of Italian food
When it depends on the shop keeper everywhere in the country,  it looks like a cultural norm
Even the grumpiest shop keeper in France is expected to salute you
Now my experience is really based mostly on Peru, maybe Bolivia, because it is true that my experience on this particular topic was way different in say Argentina, Brasil or Colombia
I should have mentioned Peru only, my bad
Thanks, it’s just that when I was visiting Peru (I went there 3 or 4 times), I’m pretty sure that my « buen dia » always got a response, and often a chat
We're the first pizza eaters in Europe (10 kg/person/year), 2nd in the world after the fatties (13 kg) and way before the Italians (5 kg)
Well we're not last but can't say that's very glorious
I trust you
Meanwhile, we get it reimbursed but we're the most anti-vax country (even worse than the US), smh
For real, you have tons and tons of good singers and not even one of them accepts to participate to Eurovision ?
"Ma Orbán Viktor újra megmentette a világot", "Orbán Viktor a legjobb elnököt", "Magyarország a legnagyobb ország a Földön"...
Well there's still a diversity in the titles and the content
well, for living there, i have never heard anybody about vaccines bad, or something like that
i don't know, maybe it's local, or something
Yeah I hate that we are forced to learn the rosbif language
[Contre toute idée reçue, un Français mange davantage de pizzas qu'un Italien
En Italie, la consommation par an et par habitant est de 5 kilos
OMG we need to bring that back
I had no idea this existed
Oh no no no wait not that quick
Based on the sample size here I'm curious as to what constitutes 85% of a person
I like how both countries want to be first at it while it's not very glorious
Well, at some point we've been enemies with the whole fucking planet
Talk about discussions being akward
Lol
Én: *Mondom azt hogy Trianon mellett születtem*
A magyarok:
All my homies hate Carthage
...until you tried to tell everyone that the raclette came from switzerland and not savoy
Never got a problem about this while we spoke several times of this with my Austauschpartner it was more a meme than something else
De Trianon egy szép kisváros
Cool
My opinion is that Napoleon was a very complex character, he was neither inherently good or evil, but he did things which were on both sides of the spectrum
Yeah it's mostly focus on banter
"Oh we  won Agincourt, muh arrow better than horse
" said the Englishman, "But we won war with cannon, silly Brit using archer against artillery
" said the Frenchman
Then take that banter and change the name of the war, the order of the the one talking and the mean of winning and you have most of the Franco-British back and forth
And the fondue aussi
I've seen a Swiss being angry at France for killing Swiss guards (they guarded the King) during the revolution, but that is so very specific than I'm quite willing to bet he was an outlier more than anything
Ja tudom de mindenképp viva Trianon
We might be unreasonable, but we respect ourselves, see, our head of state don't come gliding with tiny flag in his hands
[*cough*]
Aaah hors de ma vue hérétique
Yeah, in the meme department, I have to agree, yous guys decided to go all in, we can't challenge you in that
I'll accept your meme dominance, my good sir
(Did he really elbow bash the kid though ? It looks like he went all in on the poor little dude)
> long may she reign
You don't need to wish she is immortal, we also have one of [those] but he doesn't have any corgi, so he is not as epic, I'll give you guys that one
Didn't realized it was in Japan, the kid seemed to have had a fun time though so no harm done
> “Doesn’t this undermine my whole raison d’être for being here
I'm admiring the honesty here, it's kinda beautiful
Well i guess one needs to realize than the wealthy difference between those "rich" and "poor" means that in "rich" countries people can buy nicer cars and spend more on iPhone
But all those countries  are highly developed places with efficient healthcare system
So all in all it has more to do with the lifestyle, and not the small difference in purchasing power
What happen if there's multiple car going past speed limit
How do the police officers to cope with it
I don't think it's a very good idea
I think i heard than some a country had come with a system in which the fine amount was defined by how much a person was making a year
It's closer to a good solution in my mind
Fine in percentage of your wealth would be efficient too
Three strikes is a lot
I drive like 3-4 hours a day often over the speed limit like you do, I get like 1 strike every 15 months or so
The point system does hurt but I'm still not driving at the correct speed despite not having all the points on my driving license
Not really the same but my region and a couple of others have something called "les 100 jours du bac" (100 days of the baccalauréat) where high schoolers disguise themselves and don't go to school, instead they just go in the city, give candies to random people and sometimes ask for money in exchange, it's still very popular around where I live and you can see hundreds of kids doing that every year around february, 100 days before the final exam of high school
Nine time out of ten I can't understand a word of what they're saying when they pretend to be french
The scenes are very funny, as they tend to sound like utter gibberish
I see it really often
What annoys me is that they make fun of French people for not having a good English accent, but I can't even understand a single word when they try to be "classy" and speak French
"Eh Voaaahlàà"
I am french and I don't watch movies often but I do watch animes and when voice actors tries to speak french, their french is always super mispronounced and all but I always like it because it is fun to hear voice actor trying to speak french and give what they can and how does the author can admire France
It honestly hurts my ears when they try to say things like “voilà and “déjà vu,” the pronunciation is never good
Yeah, that's horrible
I remember watching an episode of heroes and a woman was speaking french, I had to watch it 8 times before giving up on trying to understand what she was saying
Also in iron man 2 movie at some point there is a cop speaking, and like i'm not from Nice, but i'm pretty sure he shouldn't have a canadian accent
I think in all the marvel movies the characters that were supposed to be french had very pure canadian accents
And when it's a native speaker he's from Québec
It sounds funny to us and when it's a serious role, it takes out of the movie
Yeah most of the time it sounds like someone trying to do a Russian accent rather than French
And the one time out of ten it’s understandable, it sounds posh and English, like if an English man were trying to have a sexy French accent
I have nothing against the English, but don’t expect me to think that this guy is French
Oui cest terrible
What ?
Lol, I'm sure you do not pretend to be french :)
I don't find French classy
The word "croûte" sums it up
But I find Italian really beautiful though
Incompréhensible et condescendant, là c'est le combo
Iron man 2
Captain america the winter soldier
Haha, I am indeed French but I did not meant that my accent is sexy (I actually think that it’s ridiculous)
What I described as sexy is an English accent in French -some English men use a sexy tone of voice whenever they speak French, it’s funny
and sometimes it kinda works
Yes that’s true
Yes, not only on mountains but also in the countryside
Definitely yes, and not only on mountains but also when hiking near the sea for example
Actually where I live you can tell the difference between tourists and locals pretty easily : tourists always seem surprised
Well basically we say hello to barely everyone we see so yes
I just went hiking last wednesday and yeah I greet other people, I mean it is kinda awkward to pass next to someone really close and not say anything
A simple hello or sometimes a quick exchange about anything really
So yeah we don't ignore people we give each other the Bonjour :)
In the mountains, in the woods, in the coast path, sometimes even in the streets when it's a small village
And obviously, you *have to* say bonjour to the shop assistants, cashiers, waiters, bus driver etc
Yes, pretty much the only time we say hello to random people we pass
Of course, and I'd extend it to our countryside as well
The only time we greet strangers
Well not at all I have no idea where you live but I say hello to everyone I see in the street lol
I biked along Route 8 from Flensburg to Copenhagen this summer, and also greeted people, I was generally the first to do so but they always reciprocated
I’m French (it was my second time in Denmark) and we greet others a lot, including in elevators, so I just did it naturally, not even thinking it could be unexpected
And in the elevator
I don't know, I great strangers everywhere
I mean, I never greeted a stranger in public (except in the countryside), and a stranger never greeted me in public so idk
Well of course if there are multiple strangers at a place we can't great everyone, but it it's just one or two strangers walking on their way and that we meet them I always say *Bonjour/Bonsoir*. Even if it is in a city, a town, countryside, mountain or whatever
Oh my god
When you say Bonjour and the other guy say Bonsoir
Anyway i greet people in waiting rooms, the bus, in the countryside, the store owners, and people who greet me in general
Hehe yeah that's embarrassing, but at least you can comfort yourself that you're polite because you greet them
I agree on where you said you greet people, seems to be the most common places where greeting is important
Weekly strikes
Not being on time for informal events
If your friend tells you the party starts at 6pm, you don't show up at 6, but more around 6:15, 6:30
It's called the "fifteen minutes of politeness"
Kissing when encountering other people
I tried to do this in other countries
Bad idea
La bise I assume
More specifically la bise with your colleagues
In France they do this with stuff like interviews or reality shows, I can't imagine watching an entire movie dubbed like this
Not really
It's considered crazy by similar people everywhere I think, but it's not specific to Belgium
I think they're not talking about the Fridays for climate strikes, but about the strikes by workers on a regular basis for every reform ever
If French don't like something, they take it to the streets
Yesterday, it was the truck drivers, railway and transportation workers, teachers, and more, against the retirement reform
Two weeks ago, it was uni students for poverty among young people
Inbreeding isn't really a problem unless it's repeated over several generations
In fact I remember reading that a slight amount of inbreeding is optimal
You're probably safe marrying your second cousin, in terms of genetic proximity it's barely above marrying someone from the same village
It is more optional than most people make it out to be honestly
My girlfriend does not kiss anyone at work because she does not want to and no one really cares, people just shake hand with her
The second one certainly isn't.
No they're overdubbing with actual voice acting
It's nothing like what the Polish guy is referring to
As far as I know, Down syndrome is unrelated to inbreeding
Actually they don't, strikes are typically on Tuesdays or Thursdays specifically to avoid that kind of abuse
In France, if you strike on friday, you'll be considered on strike on saturday and sunday too
Your employer will remove 3 days out of your salary
I find just one so weird
It feels intimate
No, though I guess you might find some in Paris and some other big cities, but hammam and spas are much more common
I think it's because here kissing once on the cheek is something you do with a partner so it's associated with intimacy
Joyeux Noël et bonne année !
Joyeux Noël !
Joyeux Noël et bonne année !
Je vous souhaite de putains de fêtes aussi bois and grills ! :)
first of all
*how dare you*
**Être soûl comme un polonais** : be drunk like a pole
Use about someone who is completly drunk but It seems the expression come from Napoléon :
« After a decisive battle of Kozietulski's Polish Light Horse in Spain in 1808, the heroic survivors of this elite unit were paraded before Napoleon
French generals, jealous and wanting to minimise the role of the Poles, indicated that the Poles were drunk
The Emperor replied: "So, gentlemen, know how to be drunk as Poles
**Branlette espagnole** : spanish titjob
**Fort comme un turc** : be strong like a turk
**C’est de l’hébreu pour moi** : this sound like hebrew
In France we say "filer a l'anglaise" which means leave the English way
We have the same game as your first example, but we call it the arab telephone
For the "it's all greek", I think we would use "it's all chinese" (c'est du chinois) but I'm not 100% sure it's actually a thing
We use "the Englishmen are landing/disembarking" when we have our period
When someone can barely say 2 words in English, we say they "speak English like a Spanish cow"
>"sair à francesa" (to walk out like a french) - walk away sneakily, without being seen, being sneaky
English speakers also say “to take French leave”, but in French, we say “filer à l'anglaise” (to make off in the English style)
I have a hard time understanding people from Quebec sometimes, due to me not being used to the accent, even though we both speak French
I had a German colleague - we worked in an English speaking environment- who, upon being introduced to me, launched into a friendly and longish greeting and explanation of I don't remember what
I was confused he was speaking German to me and had to irrupt at one point: "I'm sorry, I don't speak German".
He replied: "I am speaking English" :'(
The accent was so thick that my brain honestly did not recognise a single word
I burn with embarrassment every time I remember this
In music class when i was 13 we listened to the french version of Hijo de la luna
And i kid you not after hearing it for the first time half the class thought it was japanese
When somebody tries to speak French in a movie to appear sexy, I 100% never understand or think they are talking about some cheese brand
french rappers are the best to say total understandable nonsense
Yes
Once I was in the metro in Lyon and facing two strangers chatting together
I was wondering which language they were speaking because it didn't sound like anything I knew
After a while I realised it was actually French with a really thick Québec accent
I also once watched the Québécois movie "Crazy" and needed subtitles
I think it's because I had never really been exposed to that accent before
Now I regularly watch Québécois youtubers etc
, so I don't think it could happen again
That used to be the case for French, until about 10 years ago when suddenly they started hiring (not always very good) French actors to speak French
Some kind of Italian creole
Interesting
Embarrassing story time
I met my first person from Quebec ever as a kid on holiday in the US
I assumed they were American trying very hard to speak French
I could not understand a word they were saying, so I was answering in English, being like "don't worry it's ok I speak English", while they stubbornly insisted on speaking (a version unintelligible to me of) French
After three-four embarrassing minutes of this exchange, I realised they were saying "je ne parle pas anglais" and their parents had sent them to the US to learn
That day I learned
Also, French in songs is ununderstandable
Especially when the singer is Japanese
It's more than a hard time sometimes
I was in a business meeting in Toronto when a person wearing native clothing came to talk to me
I just answered "Oui
", and she hapilly came back with a coffee for me
I was not sure at all what she had asked me
Also recently I was trying to figure out how to use a fire stone and I found this video:
I could understand about 3/4 of what one guy is saying and 1/4 the other guy
When I was living in Lille, one guy called me about my house with a strong northen accent
I couldn't understand a word
It *really* depends on the person singing for me, some person not speaking French saying or singing stuff in French are completely ununderstandable, other are not
Same here
My roommate telling me "Va ker la wassingue dans le trou" took me a bit of time and explanation
Ch'ti isnt exactly french though
Yeah, but did ya do it ?
Yes, I figured out they were rural people with a particularly strong accent
You missed a great opportunity to dunk on the swedes here, are you even really Danish
You know, most of the people who work at my McDonalds including me are university students, so treating us like lowly idiots makes even less sense in that regard
Gotta start somewhere right
Supermarket cashier was often said, McDonald as well but it's more seen as a student job
Same thing with McDonald's, or they say "you'll end up being a hair dresser/garbage man"
I get that there's downsides to these jobs, but there's some in every single job, and these are pretty well-paid, so yeah, doesn't make much sense to me
Plus it pays farely well, and you only work a few hours a day
Well said
If only more people thought like that
When I was a teen, I spend 2 weeks in the USA, my host family asked me:
\- if we had  sinks in our houses
\- Their 15 years old son asked me if I had to go to school by horse
\- what was my favorite red wine (I was 14
\- not to take their son's virginity, because "here girls are not easy like in france". They were scared I would try to "seduce" him (again, I was 14
and I had never kissed a boy)
Also they took me to a supermarket and show me how it works like "isn't it great
you take what you wants, put it in this , then you go to the lady and pay
great right
". I had to politly say we had supermarkets in france too
And they gifted me a picture of washington DC's subway as a souvenir
I know not every american are like this but come on, the parents were college teachers
They were very nice and lovely to me, they made sure I had fun (they took me to a theme park, a baseball game and a boat trip to baltimore
) and felt welcomed  and I'm so grateful for it but they treated me like they were doing some kind of humanitarian mission
The classic "france surrender military bad" and no, we don't all cheat with everyone and no, it's not seen as normal
Some people seem to think that the académie française has a legislative power and that everyone religiously follows what they say, some even think you can be fined for using English words when an equivalent académie approved French word exists
Académie française is an assembly of semi senile people who are widely ignored by 99% of people
Not me but my cousin who studied in the US had to assure an American student that travelling to Paris was perfectly safe, she was not going to be abducted by Albanian gangsters and be sold into sex slavery unless her dad had "a particular set of skills". She basically believed Taken was a documentary
* The French hate Americans
* The French are ok with pedophilia
* The French lost every war
* The French are racist to anyone who is not French
We're nice, don't hesitate to ask for direction :)
"French people always surrender in wars
Your flag is the white flag
" even though France is probably the country with the most wars won (in terms of wars won/numbers of wars)
Haha yeah I hate it when North Americans automatically look at me to choose wine at dinner
I know next to nothing about wine and we can't grow it in my region
> "here girls are not easy like in france"
I heard this one many times from north americans
Also the "all french dudes cheat on their wife".
[Would I lie to you]
I've heard that from French people too
It's always entertaining to listen to left-wing and right-wing Americans talk about socialism in Northern Europe
I understand that the news, especially cable news, are dumbed-down so people can understand but still, it baffles me that smart politicians like Bernie Sanders make that mistake
Well
I'm sorry to say: I still don't like red wine much
I prefer white wine
I swear I'm french\^\^
Our knowledge of eastern europe is embarrassing af
Yes
at least I tried to
My english is bad today, but when I was 14 it was
well, you know\^\^ I knew enough to understand but not to reply so I just weirdly smiled for 2 weeks
But they took me to visit the city with a segway wich were new at that time and didn't exist in France yet, that was really cool
I live in Bordeaux and don't like red wine
Foreigners are always disappointed when I say I don't know shit about it
I can help with rosé or white though
lool I 'm glad to see I'm not the only one
In deed
hahaha
I can imagine that\^\^
It was at Washington DC, I was from Lyon, it's a small city for american, but the third for us
But I would had love to go to school with horses
I wish :)
hahaha I didn't think about that
maybe next time ;)
some of us have bidets, but sshhh ;)
I wasn't a exchange with a school, my mother knew a french teacher (I don't know from wich school) and asked her to find a family to host me and an other one for my best friend
We went together, one in each family then their sons went to our home for 2 weeks too
haha no, they asked me NOT to take it
They were worry I would try, I gess
I only cheat on the weekends, that doesn't count
It's actually closer to the etymology of the word
They replaced the *f* by a *ph* at the beginning of the 20th century to make the word looks like it's coming from ancient Greek, but it is actually coming from Arabic/Persian, so they went back on that decision in 1990
In Californian universities apparenťly
Polanski
He's in France since the 70's and there's no legal ground to extradite him back to the US
So people just assume the French are ok with pedophilia
Our knowledge in general is embarrasing
It's nice to know I'm not the only one
Sadly no
I got similar questions when I was there as an exchange student
The parents also tried to explain to me the concept of a supermarket, I didn't really react because I didn't really understand what was happening haha
Other kids were asking questions like "do you have a TV in your home
Electricity
Shampoo
" etc
Good intentioned and lovely people but I feel like some of them spent their entire lives only looking at their own navels haha
It’s socialist by US standards because Americans are much more individualistic and also have been brainwashed for decades during the Cold War and told American capitalism is only way
The weak political cultural, 320 million people and only two political parties, does not help
let's just say we appreciate the effort
Depends on what you eat with it
The white/mixed community in New Caledonia is known to have a horde-riding tradition
But it's probably not so much the case anymore
She still went to school at 120 yo ?
We have so much to make fun of, I'm glad you can enjoy it   ;-)
I don't know, I guess because here it's more common than in the US to talk about sexe
while they are more modest about it
Also the " abstinence is better" thing doesn't exist here
It was a math joke, because 5
=1*2*3*4*5=120
I'm sorry
Our freedom ends where other's freedom and rights start
And children should have the right to a healthy life and to not be subjected to their parents' stupidity without their consent
Children's interests have priority over their family's power to potentially ruin their life
I fully support Germany and hope all other countries will eventually follow
Absolutely, we should not leave public health in the hands of irrationally retarded people who don’t understand science
If the lack of vaccination only hurt themselves I would be against forcing anything but herd immunity is a critical factor and the children of anti vaxx parents are not responsible for their parents’ stupidity
Flu shots are less effective for elders, this is why we ask to the rest of the population to do it too
Same in France
From English to French, I have an edition of Lord if the Rings that says “ne m’oubliez pas” for “myosotis” (they translated “forget-me-nots” literally, as a sentence rather than as the name of the flower)
Same for water lilies, but those do not seem _that_ out of place
I mean, I’m French it would be “nénuphar”, not “lys d’eau”, but those at least sound poetic
The forget-me-nots, on the other hand
that sentence was painful to read
Recently I saw the menu of a French restaurant in a touristy place, it was written in French and English
They translated « Foie gras fait maison » (homemade foie gras) to « Foie gras House »
Just under it was : « Saint Marcelin » (the name of the cheese) « Holy cheese Marcelin »
I read that as “castrated cook” for a second
Made me laugh
That article/post was super interesting
Thanks
I bet they knew it
This just reminded me that there was a time when eating bulls’ testis was a thing
What's your hometown
Lived a year in Malta, never thought cycling was an option given how people were driving :p
I don't think tourists would derive much enjoyment of a visit in Nieuw West tbh
It's 35°C in southern France, and I'm stuck in a classroom all day because I'm taking my finals, which have been delayed because of the pandemic
I'm definitely not okay
31° in northen France, where houses are made to keep the heat
I've started to make room in my fridge, I think I'll live in it now
South of France here
Not unusual for this time of year unfortunately
It was much worse last year
The nights are still pretty cool, so it's unpleasant but ok
If this were as hot as it's gonna get I could handle it for the time it'll last but we know the worst is still coming
The hot weather doesn't bother as much as the need to keep windows open at night and not getting any sleep because of mosquitoes
I live in Southern France and it's 27°, it's not very hot for us  but I'm sure that I will suffer more in July or August with 35/36°.
Thank you, I'll try and do my best :)
I have a fan, that's as far as my plan goes
The first few days it starts getting hot I can still manage to keep the windows closed at night, so I just let my windows open as long as I can before bed then I gas them and myself in the bedroom with a good old can of raid
Well, if you don't have anything to refresh the air, you just suffer in pain
At least we got the sea at 10 minures so if it's really hot, we can spend the afternoon at the beach
The one I have stinks, but I prefer that than spending the night fighting against the mosquitoes
Ah, lovely diagonale du vide
In short, because there's nothing there but fields
So the land is mostly used for agriculture
A ridiculous amount of French people live clustered around Paris
Metropolitan France has ~65M people, and 12M+ of those are around or in Paris
If you want a historical answer, the empty spots are mostly due to Rural Flight, when most people crowded in cities due to industrialization
I lived near the border between the Center region and Bourgogne
There used to be a lot of metallurgical plants in the area, some dated as far back as the middle ages
But they all closed now, as they couldn't compete with German's steel and most of all, Chinese exports
These plants, and other factories, used to feed economically wise the whole region
Their workers spent their wages into local clothes, bars, libraries, in turn creating what is called in economy a "virtuous circle".
But since these jobs disappeared, most folks realised that they or their childred needed to move elsewhere to find employment
There are exceptions of course, and thanks to wine production and some agriculture, there is still some activity there, but way less than it used to be
I've seen a little town having shops for basically anything, including video games at the end of the 90's.
Now the whole majority of these businesses are closed
That is quite chilling tbh
Yeah I never understood why 70% of the posts there have a bunch of deleted comments as answers
literally have only seen 5 posts with actual answers there
"A return to partible inheritance is probably the most easily described component"
I always cringe when i see this theory brought up, it's nowhere near the more logical explaination, for several reasons
People just don't chose to have children solely in consideration of inheritance laws
Besides france's legal system was, up until the revolution, far from unified and partible inheritance, while very common, was not the only system in france
Half of the lands where owned by nobility and clergy, which means that many peasants used to work lands that were not theirs anyways, so the idea that they would refrain from having more children (and potentially limiting their household's income) simply in ordre to preserve the right of their children to inherit something they don't own is odd at best
The most logical and obvious explaination is that medieval agriculture technics simply could not support more than a 30M inhabitants
And given the regularity of famines in the country up until the industrial revolution, that seems way more likely
Malthusian policies could also be part of it
I've always been interested in the Azores
How is life there
Usually we don't talk about Guiana in the info except if they protest
From what I hear there is a BIG problem of violence + no employment
Most of the people live on the coast, Brazilian illegal immigrants are common since the frontier is so huge, so more poverty emerge
I'm pretty sure there is more positive fact, but we are so much centralise that I don't really know what can I share you more as just a french leaving near Paris
Don't you think that self governance is enough of a reason in itself
Much of what you're saying has been used for 1900 Ireland (or current northern Ireland for that matter)
I see, it does look good tho ;)
I've never been to Portugal, but I really hope to visit the Azores one day
Any particular island to recommend
Wow thanks a lot for your advices
I'll save that comment for future uses :D
Also I'm sure Portuguese people don't like when we talk Spanish to them
I know it's a beautiful place nature wise, is there anything worth seeing on the historical side
Interesting
Really thank you for the answers :)
Yeah, would be cool
OP could make one thread per day with the date as title
Sub please
Thanks
Hope your pet is fine
>What are people from your country born with
Anger
Contradictory spirit also
It would make biking harder though
Damn
I work at a tax office in France and we just ask people to send us a mail with a copy of their id so we can ascertain it’s them and we send the number back
It’s insane to think an administration may be more obtuse than the French one
"You're just born, now you have to pay all the medical staff that helped you to born
Damn, I will print this comment and give it to the next guy who claims we are being difficult
Nationality vs Citizenship .... FIGHT !
When I meet a Wallon or a French-speaking swiss, it feels like they are actually French with an accent and living under other laws
I guess nationality is a question of point of view
I'm from the other side of the border, from Dunkerque
We're French but at the same time we claim that we're Flemish as well even tho almost none of us actually speak Flemish
But we do have some Carnival songs that use flemish words
Come nie mee
Come nie mee
Come nie mee Nae boven
Travelling around the world makes me feel even more French than just going across the border
And I've noticed the only Europeans we can consistently get along with in terms of group dynamics are basically Latins and Germans
Northerners are just as remote as Koreans
French third
I'm from Dunkerque, we often go to De Panne or Oostende for the Waffel
I've travelled a lot but I've never thought of identifying myself as an European, wherever I am in the world when asked I say that I'm French
Might very much be, in France we make a distinction between Nationality and Citizenship, but it's more or less the one between Ethnicity and Citizenship
Once I even made the trip by foot from Dunkerque to De Panne, it's a continuous beach and sand dunes, it's like a 3h walk, really nice in the Summer
Technically speaking, from the etymology of the word, Welsh, who comes from the German "Wahl", means "someone who doesn't speak a Germanic language". So, for them it was the people speaking a gallo-roman language
When the Saxons and the Angles invaded the British Isles then the local people (Celts), who weren't speaking a germanic language, got called Welsh
Same in Belgium, the "Walloons" have the same etymological origins, in Belgium they are surrendered by Germanic speaking people so for those Germanic people, the "Walloons" are "the ones who don't speak Germanic". In Romania, who speak a roman language, it's the same and it gave the word "Wallachia". And also in Switzerland, there's a group of people speaking a Romanche language and they're called "Welsche"!
So, technically, if you speak English (which is a germanic language) but not Welsh then you are not a Welsh ;)
I'll say that in that case the person will be Canadian
To me the language is the most important aspect to being part or not of a culture/nation
For example, between someone that was born French from French parent, still has the citizenship, but moved away at a young age and doesn't speak French, and someone who speaks french fluently/natively but isn't of French ancestry and doesn't have the French citizenship then I'll definitely consider that it's the one who speaks French that is the most French in that case
But I understand that it isn't the case everywhere, in France, having a share common language was quite pushed to the population over the past centuries and is definitely a strong defining characteristic for us
> Say you lived in Quebec, had fully quebecois ancestry but went to a English speaking school outside of Quebec, only knowing a small amount of french, would you be Canadian, or quebecois
Anglo-Canadian, without a doubt
You can't be Québecois or French without speaking French
You can be black, you can be a three-legged whore, you can be a fucking duck, but you can't *not* speak French
I think that's more or less the universal answer you'd get from French-Canadians and French people
I heard that Saint-Etienne is an ugly city and Brest is a very brutalist city, I love the concrete and brutalist architecture tho
This is the ugliest town I've ever seen holy shit
Having lived in Saint-Etienne, the city is pretty ugly but people are super nice
I'd rather live there than in Lyon
Grenoble is my homecity and is mostly super ugly
The surroundings largely make up for it though
Le Havre has the same reputation as Brest
My mother lived in Brest and in Cherbourg, the only thing she ever says about those cities is how ugly they are
St Nazaire
Also, I'd say that Gueret is pretty lame
Wait what's wrong with St-Étienne
Brest is the real winner, but Le Havre is a close contender as well
I scrolled down to find the first comment from a frenchie
So glad Marseille is not in the list <3
I love Köln though
Don't know if it's pretty or ugly but they surely know how to karneval
Just looked them up and while they look fake af it's still a nice type of fake, like Hollywood
If you want ugly touristy mediterranean towns, look up La Grande Motte
Damn if that is a criteria for you, don't ever come to France
Don’t know if it’s ugly but it seems like one really boring city
It’s near Cinque Terre, but it doesn’t have the charming buildings or dramatic cliffs
IMO La Spezia was nothing amazing but it wasn’t bad either
If *that’s* the worst that Italy has to offer, I think the country must be pretty damn good-looking
That's because of Perret, but honestly the church and all is really classy there
The volcanic rock is cool as hell though, I actually found it rather pretty when I went there
"Full of roundabouts"
Almost all the cities that are considered as being horrible were built in the 1960’s, the same goes for the Parisian suburbs and Marseille
A famous architect « Le Corbusier » even wanted to destroy the historic center of Paris to build those ugly cheap buildings because « It would be more practical ». Good thing it didn’t happen
Because you were in the wrong cities at the wrong hours
Crack heads
crack heads everywhere
It's a mix of lack of government funded assistance for those who need mental care and the general culture at large
I mean, it's not like you don't see crazy folk on the tube/métro in London or Paris, but it's certainly not as prolific as in some major West Coast cities or economically struggling rural areas in the States
I think the way that Americans tend to look at the world can be very stressful
There's a zero-sum mentality that both drives them to be as productive as possible while burning everything they have to sustain themselves - often out of necessity, since weak workers' rights and unconscionably high costs of living via insurance (health and auto), education, transportation, and lodging make life extremely difficult
Combine that with the sheer prevalence of religion in the country, an absurd "bootstrap" mentality that blames all failure on the "personal character" or "moral fiber" of an individual, and a primary education system that promotes a myopic and dogmatic brand of patriotism that makes the country seem above the world rather than of the world, and you've got a recipe for some crazy-ass people
**Article 1**
France  shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic
It  shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without  distinction of origin, race or religion
It shall respect all beliefs
It shall be organised on a decentralised basis
Statutes shall promote equal access by women and men to elective  offices and posts as well as to professional and social positions
In the preamble of the construction there is also:
Preamble
The French people solemnly proclaim their attachment to the Rights of Man and the principles of national sovereignty as defined by the Declaration of 1789
It would have been so funny if this law was the first article of Bavarian constitution
...  confirmed and complemented by the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946, and to the rights and duties as defined in the Charter for the Environment of 2004
That part is important as well, as those 3 texts (and the preamble itself) are therefore part of the "block of constitutionnality", and have constitutionnal value
They don't
They don’t have much power compared to German Länder, sure, but I think that the idea at some point was to never again have something like Louis XIV’s hyper-centralized state
I’m not a specialist, though
Edit: plus, this is the beginning of the actual Constitution and I’m not that sure that Louis XIV was the first thing that came to mind in 1958
It may have more to do with the way the third and fourth Republics were organized
Statutes, not statues (not sure if you were joking\^\^), but yes, we do have a thing for statues
"The republic of Poland is a republic :p "
Yes, it refers to the separation of power and that a single man don't have absolute power over the state
Edit : I was apparently wrong, look at the comment below
From 1958 to 1971, the Constitutional Council (our BVerfG) only controled the respect of the articles of the Constitution, that is, only the respect of the institutional rules: the articles of our Constitution enunciate almost no individual rights
The preamble was straight up ignored, as it holds little normative value (as you can see [here]
But in a case in 1971, the Constitutional Council refered to the preamble of the Constitution, and thus gave normative value to the preamble, but most importantly the texts cited in it (at the time: the preamble of the Constitution of 1946, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789; the Charter of the Environment was added in 2004, but it doesn't bring much in terms of rights or obligations)
The Constitutional Council basically said that from then on, it would not only be a guardian of the institutions of the French State, but also of the rights and liberties of the citizens and of the rule of law
Nowadays, people can object to a law or a justice decision on the basis of the rights & values enunciated in the texts that the Preamble cites
Certainly does not, this was just a cheeky word play
Not a thing on r/france, but we did kidnap it one time
A Portuguese guy threw a piece of cinder block at me
I went to porto (portugal) for a week with a friend
We stayed in a youth hostel near Gaia, just outside of Porto
The hostel was big and had a terrace with a great view of Porto
For several days we noticed that a man in hoddy was watching us from his window when we were eating on the terrace
When we turned our heads in his direction, he either kept a stony face or he would wave at us
At first, we though it was funny
Then we started to get a little scared
Every day he would stand there at his window and watch the passers-by
One day, he came down on the little wall above the terrace and waved at us again
We ignored him
In the afternoon, as I went out on the terrace to smoke, I turned around in the direction of the building
And there, he threw a piece of cinder block at me
From his window
Wtf
&#x200B;
Except that:
* I saw an English girl entering the London Underground with a huge helium balloon shaped like a dick at 7am,
* A drunk dude from New zealand threw up on me because I refused his advances
It was in the London underground again,
* A old and scary Thai soldier asked me to do a selfie with him in Bangkok,
* In 9th grade, during a school exchange in Leverkusen (Germany), I went to a German secondary school
When my class arrived at the school yard, about 30 young Germans stood at the windows and sang "voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir". Was weird
I went to Peru with a group of 20 people or so when I was 18
We did a 3 days trek in the Andes and it was at the time of the Pachamama (1st of August)
Our guides were Quechua people so we all observed the ritual together
It was really peaceful and weird
We all took the coca and had to keep it in our mouth for the whole ritual
It was a really good memory
I was in Krakow, Poland
Obviously a very touristic city so there were a lot of shady people
One woman accosted me and my friends to go in her strip club
We followed her because we were drunk af and it turns out it was a completely empty strip club (except the dancers) with very shady things on the "menu"
hahaha, wtf ? I hope she get a copy of that picture, it's really funny !
And yes, I staid one month in Cambodga/thailand and I have been taken in photo a dozen of times
Mostly by chinese tourists though
I guess they are not used to see foreigners
I live in a big german city and there is no such thing
What's fascinating to me is I hadn't even noticed before reading this thread
It's a big plus for me, public transport is already tiring enough without adding extra noise and so on to it
They have mirrors or cameras to be able to see every door in case of an issue
How [frencher] can we get
[This one] because of all the meme we got
Like [this one] or [this] [this one] or [this]
I prefer [this man] who braves the elements to seek his basic needs
How about [this] ? Stylish too, since we have that reputation
Daily routine Var edition
I'm sorry but if I have no baguettes anymore, but I have [this] After Paris, deep countryside
This picture needs far more attention
It reminds me [this]
Hmmmm very good, you just need someone lighting a cigarette with the fire in the background and it's perfect
The overseas territories tend to be ignored by the government
Even though France owns a lot
The north that has suffered greatly from the de-industrialization driven by the neo-liberalism of the European Union
The mass unemployment that has been caused there is terrible
Idk if it's known or not, but during WW2, Nazis forcefully enrolled Frenchs to serve
The term Malgré-nous (French: "against our will") refers to men of the Alsace-Moselle region who were conscripted into the German Wehrmacht or the Waffen-SS during the Second World War
The French wars of Religion
I'm sure some people have heard of it, but I doubt people really understand the scale of it
\~3,000,000 Frenchmen died, which makes it a death toll higher than our death toll from WWI and WWII combined
If people understood the extremely bloody and painful part that religion plays in civil conflict in France I think they would be less shocked about our laws/culture surrounding religion today
I found a video about Swiss history online months ago and it was really interesting
The main takeout of it was that Swiss are fierce warriors since ages contrary to the popular view
You also had a PM shot dead while in office not so long ago I think ?
I was taught that in school so I don't think it's that obscure (last year of highschool)
They also forced hundreds of thousands of French people to work in Germany
Also, almost two million French prisonners spent the war there and some were also forced to work
Learned about that in highschool
Et les noyades de Nantes
Then now's the time to follow /r/100yearsago - you'll got a day-by-day retelling of the 1920s for the next decade
A lot of Republican exilees fought with the French armies in 1940 and then from London or overseas after the fall of France iirc
That's mainly post war french communist propaganda, claming that Dien Bien Phu was "The SS last battle". It's true some men that were in the SS were also in the légion at DBP, but by the time the war started most of them had been purged
The difference is that the Malgré-nous were later accused of warcrimes
It left a wide open scar for these people
I'm Alsatian, and even if i don't know of my family having lived that, i'm really sensitive to it
Here :
(Edit : removed "Sir", sorry)
One of the division that was first sent to Paris was mostly (entirely
not sure) Spanish that helped the French army from more or less day 1
Un de mes ancêtres était un chouan
Drinking wine in anything that isn't a wine glass
No one around me really cares, but I always have an hesitation moment before pouring
Same goes for cutting the cheese
Always a doubt about how it is supposed to be "properly" sliced
The sunday's admonitions of my father are still vivid, that's for sure
That always bothers me when visiting other countries
In France, if you ask for water, the waiter will ask if you want tap or mineral water
Same with bread, you don't even have to ask for it and it's free
Really
Here it's always included and normal to ask for tap water, it's usually the same quality as the bottled one anyway
We are lucky in France that it is common to ask for tap water
It is better to specifically request "une carafe d'eau" instead of just "de l'eau", since if you request a carafe, it means it is not bottled water, hence meaning tap water
Some restaurants though purposely keep these pitchers of tap water at room temperature so that if you want cold water, you need to order a bottle
It is a sly move, but it happens
It is very unusual to request ice though
So if you ask for tap water and ice, you are definitely crossing the line
I swear, watching foreign people trying to cut cheese makes me scream internally
Like chalk screaking on a blackboard
I'm sure that is how the German Gestapo used to torture French resistants
Same here
But I can drink a beer in a regular glass without even thinking about it
I wish it was the same in France (it's basically becoming illegal though
) I absolutely hate this shit
Why 5 precisely
Made me remember I drank first at the exact age of 5
Jaywalking when there is no traffic
Probably because most people have a proper lunch at the same time as a drink, something unheard of in the Neherlands
Yeah I think it is 15 in France
May be legal but definitely wrong
Water, bread and even sometimes olives and/or pâté are free
Worse would be for me to see someone smear Foie Gras like it's some supermarket grade paté.
[Relevant video]
I think most of us have been there to be honest, or from half pint glasses for that matter
My mom will eat the sunday chicken with her bare hands, so there goes the étiquette as well as my father's love for good table manners
Well, we have specific cheese knifes
As for cheese slicers, I have only used them on very specific cheeses, like a sheep cheese like Ossau Iraty
You go and try cutting camembert, brie or Roquefort with a cheese slicer and tell me how it went
Yeah, knife makes sense for most of our cheeses
Cheese slicers gives you a wide and thin slice of cheese
We don't really have a use for those
We have cheese knives and opinels
Sure thing
It's just "not the way it's supposed to be done". At least that's what I've been taught, and it makes sense if you want to enjoy wine "the proper way". A duralex glass is not the perfect glass to "shake" the wine for it to release its flavours and then dive your nose in it
My guilt is proportionate with the quality of the wine let's say
Yeah I don't even own wine glasses
Ah, what should I say then ?
I must have been around the same age, my father had me try beer, and I thought it tasted horrible
France does it even better
It's free and you get a pitcher
No need to get a waiter annoying you every 10 mn
Add to the list salad, peanuts and chips
But free pâté? That's the first time I've heard of this
I am interested
No, but tap water is
I thought it was the same elsewhere
Jsp on boit de la Vittel ici
No French want a thin slice of cheese
We want a good chunk of cheese
That's maybe why
For me it was wine
I lied on the sofa for the rest of the day
Free rillettes would have been more accurate, but yes it definitely happens in some places
Most of the "proper" cheese cutting etiquette is based on trying to get equitable slices from all parts of the bloc so no one ends up with just the crust
So if you think about that before cutting, there is 99% chance you are cutting it correctly
We don't really eat that many sandwiches in the first place
And when we do, the cheese if often in a rectangular parallelepiped form (if not spreadable)
Plus most sandwitches you make yourself are in a baguette, not between square loaves of bread, so the cheese slice doesn't really fit
That's a bad point
Is that a good or bad point
where is here
Oiseau (bird) is the only French word that doesn't sound at all (wah zoh) like the letters it's written with
I'd say entitled cunts speaking it
That seems pretty French to me
We have the only Romance language with a fucked spelling (seriously, who could guess that "oiseaux" is pronounced [wazo]
In French, we have a word that changes all its letters at plural form:
"Œil" means "eye" and "yeux" means "eyes".
English has the same thing (example: freedom, from Germanic roots, vs liberty, from Latin roots)
Same in French, that little "ouais" you pronounce while inhaling air
All languages with genders have no rule for it I think (for knowing French and German I can tell you that's just random)
Tudtam de soha nem értettem miért, tud valaki a választ
Ich gehe noch zur Schule could also mean you are walking to school but it is taking a while no
For an example :
- Wo bist du, uberblau
Frau Müller fängt gleich mit dem Unterricht an
- Ich gehe noch zur Schule
Ich musste einen Umweg machen, um die Demonstranten zu vermeiden
Hab noch nie gehört jemand sagen "ich gehe ja eigentlich zur Schule". Es klingelt wie "ich bin so froh dort zu gehen"
Same in Hungarian, and there even postpositions like -ba/-be, -ban/-ben and -ból/-ből.
Hungarian
Like what
Hungarian has it but only for suffixes
You can absolutely have dark and light vowels in the same word
Ø exists in Danish, å in Swedish and Finnish and æ in Latin
Sorry
Same in Hungarian:
"Giorgios is here": (A) Giorgios itt van
"Giorgios' house": Giorgiosé ház.
"Call Giorgios": Hívd Giorgiost
There is no vocative but plenty of other cases:
"I'm going to into Giorgios": Giorgiosba megyek
"I'm inside of Giorgios": Giorgiosban vagyok
"I'm going outside from inside of Giorgios": Giorgiosból kimegyek
"I'm talking about Giorgios": Giorgiosról beszélek
"I'm at Giorgios'": Giorgiosnál vagyok
"I'm going to Giorgios": Giorgioshoz megyek
And so go on, there are 18 cases in total, I think no European language has more
Funny that you'd use the *liaison* between the words "pas" et "un" in your example since it's not uncommon to **not** pronounce it, whereas the next two ones have a mandatory one (un [n]ami)
Notice that aa doesn't exist in Hungarian
They would write it á. It only exists in compound words like visszaadja
The scientific alphabet of Gabon also uses them
Yes but not at all like the individual letters it's written with
Yes, all I'm trying to say is that no letter is pronounced like in the alphabet
There's no other word in French like this
If you don't know how to read French there's no way you can deduct the pronunciation from the spelling
Me neither
But I try to hide it by pointing out other people's mistakes
Yeah I found it because I was thinking about the same thing as you
Winter time
Having light in the morning helps me wake up and not feel exhausted all day
Totally worth having less light in the evening for me (especially since I wouldn't enjoy it
Because too tired)
I guess I'm weird for needing sunlight to actually wake up though, most people ask for summer time here
Winter time, because it has the solar time centered on the EU (instead of summer time, which has it centered around Ukraine)
Did I understand something wrong or do people here don't make sense ? A lot of people seem to say they can't stand the free time in the night, so summer time
Those people prefer to have sunset after 9am and sundown before 6pm all winter because they don't want to be out in the night ? What ?
Summer time because it's the actual solar time duh
You're going to get in the dark both morning and evening with a "normal" 9-6 schedule in winter with summer time
People seem to forget the change works both way
To get more sun in the season where sun is abundant already means wants less sun when it is rare already
The natural time is the summer time lol
But work hours are an *even more* arbitrary human invention
Instead of working from 9-17h, we could work from 8-16h, and voilà: it’s equivalent to summer hours
Shortest day (around December 21st) in Belgium is like 8:30 to 16:30
Change to summer time and you get 9:30 to 17:30
You don't get more sun after work and you're in the dark until 9:30, eww
Those people here that say they want day until 11pm in summer but night from 5:30pm to 9:30am in december
Wtf
I'm with you there
I hate when it's still dark at 9:30, I just can't wake up properly and then my whole day is ruined
But having a dark evening doesn't bother me at all
Is it worth 9am dawn 6pm dusk in winter ?
Summertime = December sun rises at past 9am and sets at before 6pm
December gonna suck so hard in summer time
You go to work, it's night
You come back home, it's night
Day doesn't matter when you're at work
So it's perpetual night for you for the entire winter
Gotta get those vitamin supplements because you gonna need them
Summer time December = no sun before 9am and after 6pm
Calculate sun times in December in summer time lol
Its already dark as fuck during winter in the morning when they go to work/school, at least with summer time they will not have to get back from school/work in total darkness too
Not sure if you are serious but summer time is not solar time at all
Call the Polizei, that german doesn't want to wörk ! Get him quick !!
(jk)
Except in winter you're in the dark both arriving and leaving work with summer time
Personally, as someone living on 50°N and suffering from insomnia, I'd rather have more daylight in the morning to reduce my melatonin consumption
Sunrise in winter is much too late on DST
Also Summer days are getting unbearably hot and I'd enjoy cooler temperatures earlier in the evening
> Also I don't get it
Just go to bed an hour earlier or get up an hour later and you have the same amount of sleep
That is what i do everytime, and guess what
Couldn't fall asleep cause i was used to winter time
Well let's not make it worse then
Why reducing the sunlight when it is already rare ?
Up there maybe but not here
Staying up a little late, yes
Go to bed early
Only if you feel tired enough to need it, so in order to be tired enough for the time change night i need to sleep less and be tired the day before
This is madness
You sleep when you are tired, if you are not tired you don't sleep
I mean its pretty simple
During the day when i'm feeling well rested i do not fall asleep randomly
In 2016 we were the first country to adopt new laws about food waste
Supermarkets bigger than 400 meters square have to seek partnerships with local associations to give them unsold food items
No country has won more Nobel Prizes for Literature than France
Of all countries which observe an “Independence Day”, 26 of them celebrate their independence from France
An I like this one
In France, you can legally marry a dead person, since 1959
And the best for the end
It is against the law in France to name a pig “Napoleon”. We have our pride
We are also very proud about the declaration of human and civi rights of 1789
And the rest is coal ?
> And the best for the end
It is against the law in France to name a pig “Napoleon”. We have our pride
This is not true at all and never was :
It does not even makes sense, farmer don't name their pigs ...
The closest that can be found on the subject is the editor of the first edition of "the animals farm" of G. Orwell who renamed the pig César
The law was created in 1959, after the Malpasset tragedy, the destruction of a dam
The tragedy killed 423 people
So, posthumous marriage is  authorized by article 171 of the french Civil Code
Law was first created during first world war
It was reintroduced following the destruction of Malpasset dam on December 2, 1959
Aim of the law is the legitimisatin of the unborn children whose fathers died as a result of this tragdey
Maybe, but the story is far much funnier than the fact that the law really exist or not
I've never seen a stray dog in France, just because a dog is walking around doesn't mean it's a stray
We use nuclear for around 70% of our electricity production, that's around 80/90% of clean energy with renewables
France is a great country for beyond understanding administrative process
Marseille, Palermo or Naples
Let's do that in corsica !
London would be interessing
Marseilles or Naples, or even Corsica
There was a game similar to GTA, I cant remember what it was named, but it was based in Nice and it was pretty good game
Napoli was my first thought, but you're right about Marseille too
Counterpoint: Malta irl is too small for an open world game
Without spoilers: you visit Malta in AC
I've just started the series and I'm looking forward to see familiar places
True, but half of that looks like de_dust without buildings
I thought of Just Cause as well
It's a game that's badly written as opposed to GTA, the goal of the games anyway is to inflict mass destruction, not having a great story
In a sense it's satire thought, as everything are stupid clichés and you can do crazy shits
It doesn't take itself seriously is what I mean
What is the biggest "tourist trap" in your country
Paris as a whole
I'm only half joking
First, there's too many tourists for it to be really enjoyable or romantic
The Eiffel Tower, Trocadero, etc, everything is crowded and packed full of people
Second, it's really expensive
Compared to other places in France, restaurants and cafés are truly more expensive (because of tourists)
Some tourist activities like going on a boat along the Seine will also empty your pockets really quick if you're not tight enough on your budget
Third, people trying to sell you shit everywhere (tiny Eiffel towers and stuff like that, way too overpriced) and people who will mug you (speaking from experience)
The touristic spots are very touristic for a reason, and it would be dumb of me to not tell you to go there
However, I would recommend you don't expect a romantic, lonely, magical Paris experience because you will never get that
Go see the monuments for the view that they bring, but don't be disappointed when you see the sea of people
Go on a walk among the less popular areas, pack your own food, and for the love of God, don't use backpacks, and put any cash and IDs in a jacket that has inner pockets, or that will get stolen
Mère Poulard restaurant in Mont Saint-Michel from what i've heard
Any France tourist area restaurant is going to be expensive and disappointing
Preparing your trip in advance and finding small restaurants that locals appreciate is mandatory
Surreal post in this time
Experiencing withdrawal ? lol
Europe has so many castles tbh
I agree
Neuschwanstein is beautiful but the town and mountains are breathtaking
The Alpsee with Tirol in the background was one of the most spectacular sights of my life
I was so disappointed to be there only for a day
It was a school trip and teachers only made us visit the castle and shops, but the trails looked even more interesting
I hope to go explore them by myself one day
I agree with you
It might be worth one visit, but I enjoy the other cities much more
Yes I do agree that Versailles is ovverrated
I like though the gardens better than the palace
And the Louvre is fascinating
That's actually kind of a smart move
La Place de l'Étoile (Arc de Triomphe's roundabout's name) is
an experience
So I live nearby Paris (15 minutes in RER)
And let's be honest, if you don't know Paris, your description is a decent match ( a tad to harsh maybe but I've seen worse)
But:
> and few legit French dining opportunities
That's false, while it's not the easiest thing to do (because you have to look for it in less touristy land), if you're friends were unable to find good French food in Paris, they either didn't search or are bad at it
This city is choke full of insanely  good restaurants, a simple google search in the area you are and you'll be able to find a good one quite easily (of the genre of your choosing)
> Huge crowds and traffic everywhere, rare to find a quiet area
I mean in the densest city in France (one of the densest in Europe too), that's sadly a given
Still, that can be somewhat circumvented if you are able to go outside of classical vacation times (end of May-Early June/ Mid-September would be my pick)
> France has so much more to give than only Paris
Also true, and if you aren't able to find a timeframe outside of school vacation times, I'd advise to go shoot for the rest of France
Take care though, some area are also choke full of tourist depending of the period (Every coast and mountains ..)
I just can't understand american people on the paris subreddit always talking about going to Disneyland
WHY
In another comment I recommended Normandy, but you'll probably want a change of weather
I think you might enjoy the South of France
There's the Cité de Carcassonne, a medevial citadel, but it's a touristic spot - -' I think that renting a place/going to a hotel in the region, and then go on a search for local curiosities, wander around the region
Some interesting places in France:
- Le Palais idéal du facteur cheval (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)
- Colorado provençal (Provence-Alpes-Côtes-d'Azur)
- Cascades du Hérisson (Bourgogne-Franche-Comté)
- Sundgau (Grand-Est)
- Vieille-ville de Troyes (Grand-Est)
- Puy de Dôme (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)
I am biased, as I'm from here, but I do find it peaceful and calm
Small villages and small towns are great if you want to be submerged by French culture and the language (you're less likely to meet other tourists)
Very beautiful and it's really worth it
But as other said, it's also very expensive
Just for an idea, one of my friend paid a medium pizza at a local domino spizza 25 euros
The worst is that he was italian, so he complained about this misfortune for the rest of the trip haha
Yeah
Someone stole my phone in Barcelona, but the police found it and gave it back to me the day after
They're good
It was kind of a nice experience to see a bureaucracy being so effective tbh
I guess they only care about stupid tourists like me
At least I met a lot of kind people trying to navigate the city without any phone or any way to contact anyone
Probably cheaper now since the zone system was ended for Navigo passes
One of the densest city in the world actually
(for a 1st world country)
You have the same park at home (and probably even better ones), why travel thousands of kilometres and go to another country to spend 2/3 of your time in a queue
I guess with all the holidays at the end of the year, more people are at home celebrating with their family and kin :) Even if Paris around Christmas time sounds very romantic (at least more than in heatwave-and-bugs summer)
Great question
They have Paris and great places around it but no they must visit the 'murican place
If you're not afraid of cold water even during the middle of July, I would say Normandy
It's not highly touristic even during summer, and has some very pretty sights
It does have the same shitty weather as Britain, but a little rain never killed anyone
:) A "major" city in the region is Cherbourg, located next to the sea
It has a museum about the sea, due to its history as a harbor
They even have a titanic exhibition
I would recommend going biking or hiking in the countryside, around the fields and woods
It's very fun, quiet, and you'll be surrounded by cows (seriously there are so many cows in Normandy)
And I love the local food
Nothing like a good camembert normand, with the cider to go with it
And due to its place next to the sea, you can also enjoy variety of seafood
Another place in Normandy which is very famous, but definitely a tourist spot/trap, is le Mont Saint-Michel
It's a very nice and peculiar place, but it's very crowded (which isn't helped by the fact that the place itself isn't gigantic to begin with, with its narrow streets)
You're welcome
I only just realized that you're American, so you may also appreciate visiting the beaches from the Normandy landings during D-Day
Honfleur, Bayeux, Étretat, Cabourg, Deauville are really nice cities in Normandy
Also if you are a fan of WW2 history you'll have plenty of things to visit
I really, really like cheese
Especially "smelly" ones
I love bread and often tuck the baguette under my arm whilst puffing away on a cigarette
I'm probably gonna enjoy a glass of wine over dinner with my roommates
Of course, we had an apero beforehand, with various types of cheese,  charcuterie and saucisson
We talked about brexit and joked about how stupid the brits were for having done that
Oh la la
Is a genuine reaction that can be used in pretty much any context/setting and I say it more than I dare admit
On the other hand, my English is pretty good and I don't live in Paris with a view on the eiffel tower
Edit: my rommate is working on the tower's painting campaign,  so there's that
Not cliché: I shower every day, I don't have hairy armpits nor legs
I'm faithfully in a committed relationship and I don't think cheating is fine
I don't really care about fashion
I have never in my life worn a béret or a marinière (stripped top
) I don't smoke
I don't play the accordion or even listen to it regularly
Maybe cliché?: I don't think I'm rude, but I'm more direct than people from Anglo-saxon culture and I can see why it could be a culture shock to them
I do think it's rude if you assume I speak English when I'm in the street or in a store, or if you start asking stuff without saying hello (but I will still answer
) I have not eaten frog legs nor seen anyone eat them before I was in my 20s (I now live in an area where they're common though, and I like them a lot
Cliché: I do love food, and would be sad without good bread if I lived abroad
A good wine is important with a good meal
I love complaining about a lot of things, especially our politicians
I don't drink wine
I drink very little alcohol
I eat bread but not baguette, I prefer whole grain loaf
My favourite bread is called here 'german bread' (pumpernickel)
I don't smoke
I don't dress up and put make up everyday
On the other hand, I do eat lots of cheeses
And meat must be rare (unless the freshness has been compromised)
As for the specifically Parisian cliché, yes I don't speak to strangers in the street, even if they look lost
Sorry
I love bread and cheese and complain a lot
But:
\- I'm not fancy, I love nothing more than burger + old sweatpant + the lord of the ring night
\-  ~~I'm fat
~~      Fine
,  let's be positive: I have *curves*
\- I don't smoke
\- I don't like red wine
\- I'm a bad cook
\- I shave (like most french women)
\- I shower (idem)
\- My baby throw food (maybe because I'm a bad cook
\- I can speak English decently (even if I'm not fluent)
\- I'm nice and friendly to every one (which is not always a good thing
\- I don't wear beret because no one does (except foreign fashion lover tourists) but like it
I'm bad at being French since I hate protest
I'm good at being Breton as I have a 2
5:1
5 meter flag
I really like cheese, am quite proud of my cooking skills, and often carry my bread under my arm
On the other hand, I despise coffee, am not much a fan of wine, speak good english and loathe garlic
Also, I fit the Breton cliches of being a bit *too* proud of my region, of handling alcohol well and often eating crêpes and galettes, but I do not eat most seafood and do not drink cider
That's when you know they are good
Pretty much the same, and I drink café au lait in a bowl for breakfast
I'm also guilty of carrying my baguette under my arm lol
You forgot to say whether you had a mistress or not
How close do you stand to people (either people you talk to or to the next people in line) to the closest ~~10~~ meter~~s~~?
I hate it too
There's an order to be respected
First, fill out empty double seats, and then, if that can't be avoided, seat next to someone as a last resort
>I hate jamón serrano
How is that even possible
How can you not like village festivals
They’re among my fondest memories growing up in southern France haha
Hey I have the same opinion about Tintin and I've offended a lot of my fellow countrymen by saying so
Cheers to that boys
I'll drink to that
Nope, (or at least none that I know of) but we have LOTS of cheese with mold
Btw may I see I love Italian cheese, it's so good and salty
In Corsica, yes
On the continent, it existed in the past
My father remembers cheese with worms when he was younger, but it's been almost completely forgotten now
I don't think anyone makes this kind of cheese any longer, other than in Corsica
Je connais personne qui fait ça... je parle du café dans un bol pas de tremper son croissant en fait
Not me but
Idk, i don't live anywhere near it but my roommate is painting it so it's a funny coïncidence
In regards to previous comments
To give you an idea, we usually spend 10-15€ each for food and drinks
So 400g charcuterie,  600g of cheese, beer, wine, and chips, appetizer (quiche or pizza for example), main course and desert
We usually cap it with a digestive
That's for 5 or 6 People aged 23-29
Do you bike everywhere
Lol the onions
I discovered it was a stereotype last year
The good People of roscoff, Brittany (Bretagne) realized it was quicker to cross the channel and sell their onions there rather than to go all the way to Paris
Yes, there are only 2 places in France, Eiffel tower land and Provence
And a long thin moustache for every man and never shower
Women don't shave also
And that's true we were all in the Résistance
Mes deux parents l'ont toujours fait, c'est pas si rare si ?
Ma mamie ne prends son café que comme ça.
Fair enough, it does get repetitive after a while
I LOVE FETA SO MUCH
I once had the wonderful idea to eat a big portion of feta in one go
Never had my mouth been so dry before
Chaource, Coulomniers and Morbier (mold) are among my personal favorites
Edit: cannot write
Non c'est normal, et tu trempes tes croissants dedans
J’ai bien l’impression que si
Tutti bene
My brain didn't process the mistake when i was proofreading
Call the inquisition !
>rainy London
sounds perfectly accurate to me
In Eurotrip, it's really meant to be over-the-top, it lacks the following scene in the hotel where they're rich with 50 cents
That reminds me of a show in France called Mafiosa, about organized crime in Corsica
A lot of the cast, including the main actress, aren't Corsican and don't even speak with a Corsican accent
I never watched but apparently it's a good show despite this
It's a great movie though, but I don't remember much is shown about Belgium
I live in Nantes, I know all about grey days with drizzle
The only one I could think of is "The EU is actually Germany trying to recreate the Reich," which I heard a few times from French people (on Twitter under tweets mentioning the EU mostly)
There are some people who believe a conspiracy that says 1000 years between antiquity and renaissance have been completely made up by at choice the jews, the freemasons, the satanist elites ...  In short, the usual suspects lol
I mean she is obviously a vampire, so it's fair to make the mistake between immortal bloodsucker and friendly-neighborhood eater
We can't trust the Swiss anyway
Poles were serbs all along ???
Not the same kind of influence for France and Germany, Germany has way more weight in internal matter (thanks to it's economy), while France is now the only somewhat "kinda-heavyweight" outside the EU (since no UK anymore, and thanks to nukes/army)
I think it was mostly to have economic deals and prevent war
So in a way, prevent any country from taking over Europe
That's a star, which is even more impressive
It's so far fetched that I like this one, it's cute
Did you hear the one about Columbus' real place of birth being Calvi, in Corsica, thus making him Corsican
Half of my family is from Corsica, I heard that one a couple of times
That's just brilliant
Never heard of it, but I'm barely surprised it's from Corsica to be honest
My handwriting is a cursed illegible sacred relic if you pronounce it you'll awake the nine fallen kings of men realm
I've almost never seen "a" written by hand, mostly "ɑ"
I briefly went to a primary school in England and it was always taught to write ‘ɑ’ but sometimes kids would try to be cool and write ‘a’. I remember half the class getting a detention when we were about 8 years old because they decided to write ‘a’.
The only time I really form it like an ‘a’ is when I’m writing æ.
I write "A" because I forgot how to write in lowercase by hand
I do when writing in script
In France we just joke about not giving back Alsace and Lorraine when we meet a German lol
In France we joke about avenging Jeanne D'Arc or reclaiming Louisiana/Québec/Nouvelle France
We have l'Alsace-Lorraine so everything is where it should be xD
Well, pretty much everyone in France consider Belgium (at least Wallonia + Brussels) and the French part of Switzerland to be French regions
It’s a very popular meme in r/france
When the riot thing started in the USA we were like, let’s go take back Louisiana while they’re not looking
Surely only flanders though
My whole family is alsatians, and I don't think anyone there wants to be German
Ain't happening xD
1812 best year
It's not so well known, and doesn't involve the eternal Anglo
'cause where friends now xD
Shhhh
We might be able to get away with quietly annexing them next time they can't form a government
Besides, we need the beer and the Netherlands needs the wine
Though come to think of it that means we should probably get Flanders and let them have Wallonie
The German state didn't care about the Alsatians when the region belonged to it
If i remember correctly, the region was not even fully integrated
(See: incident de Saverne/Zabern-Affäre)
On the other side, the French state took advantage of this situation to give birth to a pro-French feeling among Alsatians
Yeah I know, we make the greatest things but we fuck up right at the end
(༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ)
Annexing takes a while to plan, I figured I'd be optimistic and bet on you having a government sometime in the next year or so, which isn't enough time to infiltrate Wallonie and make it look democratic
You're in, mate !
French medias haven't talked about it at all
Yep, they talked about it on several medias today
We can send special Révolution forces
Their massive debt
Vat
Taxes
It's very different than here in France
Not saying it's bad or good just very different
Tipping
I can't wrap my head around the idea of waiters being so underpaid that they expect customers (who already paid for their food) to also pay them for the service
Bosses should start paying their employees decently
"As an Irish-American I..."
"Oh, your parents are Irish and you were born in the USA ? Cool"
"No, my great great great great great great great great great grandfather had a cousin with the irish citizenship"
And others variants
And worse of all "I know how to recognize good french food, my great great great great great great great great grandmother was born in Brittany"
Just shut the hell up
The whole race concept is super weird
Had an American teacher (English teacher), and when we would talk about social issues, society, etc, she would use "race" in English and then struggle to use another word in French, because the word "race" is the same in French but has deep racist connotations
In france you get paid and can stay home :
* 3 or 5 days per year for caring for sick children *(edit; this is a common feat from private companies, but it's not mandatory)*
* unlimited sick days if a doctor says so (broken legs, depression, burnout, bore out, you name it)
* 4 days for your wedding
* 1 day if your child gets married
* 3 days for a birth in your home (yes, even if it's not your child)
* 7 days if one of your child dies
* 3 days if your wife/husband/sister/brother/parent dies
> 3 days if your wife/husband/sister/brother/parent dies
Mhmmm
Can we combine them all
Sick days for children is not in every company
Mine doesn't offer any, however we are entitled to 2 days per year of paid leave without any medical prescription
Typically it's for when you're sick but don't necessarily need to see a doctor, but you can use it for sick kids or even a hangover if you want
Only a biscuit ? I get offered a whole meal afterwards
if you're ch'ti
Yeah you'd get 100% of your base salary
We can thank the communists
Maybe I didn't understand but it's for every company, public or private
You'd typically have to prove that you are moving by giving a new address to your employer
Depends where in France
I've gone to places that offered a sandwich afterwards, and others where I just get unlimited snacks, but I try not to abuse it
Or Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes
Yes, correct, it depends on the company
I was mostly replying to the previous comment, not to OP
Yeah you can ask for it but you don't get paid (that's in the link you sent)
Mine is unlimited snacks and drinks : sandwiches, biscuits, cookies, cakes, coffee, water, you name it
I don't abuse it either but it's a nice incentive to donate lol
Please, if you know why it's not true, explain why, it will be more productive for everyone
Ah god dammit, you right, i'll edit my post
yeah i edited my post, i was wrong !
No probs
This post is really great ! People probably won't see this but thank you very much for telling the reality
On the internet, Nordic countries are often idealized and cons are not discussed
This is refreshing !
French people do that all the time
Not specific to Scandinavia
Imma spill some beans
Lozère
Nature all around
The Gorges du Tarn are partially located there
The place is so sparsely populated that I am sure that they didn't have any problems with covid
The best unknown city in my region would be Blois, France
It is not very huge but have a impressive past and really beautiful architecture
It have a castle built on a hill that stand over the city, the castle is very representive of the evolution of the French style castle from the renaissance to baroque with all of those styles are put together next to one another
It also have a house of magic where mechanical dragons come out through the windows
It was an important place of the late middle ages during the crusades, even a king of England was a "de Blois".
It is
I loved it
Really nice city
Have you been to this other Italian secret destination, Venice
I went to huesca for an highschool trip
It's was very pleasant, i enjoyed the sierra de Guara and the Loarre castle !
Siena is generally considered part of Florence's surroundings
It's gorgeous though
Not quite, as Pisa is further
But it takes one hour to drive from the cathedral in Florence to the one in Siena, so a simple day trip
"Bite" means "dick" in French
"Verge" also means "dick", but more formal/medical
Peter means "to fart" in french (or to break in modern slang)
But the pronounciation is different
Fee means fairy in french aswell
But well french has ~~Italian~~ latin, Greek and Germanic roots so it makes sense
EDIT: i wrote italian, but I meant latin obviously
Fée in French for the fairy
The bit about dick is a good basis for jokes, though
But I have a poor sense of humour, they say
I think there's a complot about squirrels because whatever the language I translate "squirrel" to it still seems unpronounceable (e.g. écureuil or Eichhörnchen)
In Czech/Slovak/Hungarian it's kurva
&#x200B;
I guess that this is the word that unites the Visegrad group
Embarassé in French has even a slightly different meaning
And that my friend is a really common mistake made by French people speaking English
Faux amis are the exact opposite of what OP is asking
*Dia* in Spanish (with an accent) and Portuguese come from Latin *dies* while Swedish/Dutch/Danish/Afrikaans/Faroese/Icelandic/Norwegian *dag* and German *Tag* come from Proto-Indo-Germanic *dagh*.
In German it's schön :)
The Italian “colazione” also looks like “collation” in French which refers to a snack
\>  to exit = salir
&#x200B;
That's funny because in French, *salir* means "to make dirty"
I love that I learned that
Thanks
(If you ever meet a French guy named Paul, do not nickname him Popol
That’s one of our names for dick, same reason as yours
Fairy is féérique (btw it's fée)
Ah it's "va te faire enculer" in french
It's macska in Hungarian
Yeah that's exactly the opposite of what OP was asking
*Fée*, for sure, I omitted the accent as it didn't matter in this context
However, *a fairy* litterally means *une fée*.
I'd say it's the same in France
Yeah I understood don't worry I just wanted to say where do both come from :)
You guys are a hidden latin language german took so much from latin
My thought exactly
People from countries sharing a language with a bigger country, do you feel overwhelmed by news related to this bigger country
I've lived in both French speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland, I was surprised to hear a lot about France politics and see France related news in Belgian and Swiss medias
Meanwhile in France we don't hear that much about Belgium or Switzerland
Is it the same with other languages and what's your feeling regarding "big brother" presence in your country's media feed
On regional news in the north of France we hear about Belgium
Yes the US is indeed a special case given its position in the world
For English in Europe it would maybe be more about UK presence in Ireland medias
On n'a jamais vue autant de seum lié un pays non plus
I do not want to leave France but if I had to chose i would go to Germany without hesitation since I love our common history and I’d like to learn the differencies between our countries
Idk if thats a good reason but when I visit (or live in) a country I love being surounded by history that make me think of where I come from, Europe is nearly paradise for this reason tho
Denmark !!! dear danish, i felt in love with your country, it is beautiful !! but the language is sooo difficult to learn
Outside of France probably only Portugal or some part of Spain
Maybe Croatia
Been living in Germany for 7 years and I'm happy I'm leaving soon, I don't really connect with the germans, most of my friends are from latin countries
In general I don't like the germanic mentality
Been to Denmark, Norway, Sweden
it's beautiful in Summer but honestly I will never want to live there
UK is also a no-no, they're just not really social and fun to be with imho (sorry)
I had a good time while travelling in Croatia, people were really nice so maybe I'll also appreciate living there, but I don't know enough
I think that Italy is a bit too conservative, I prefer Spain/Portugal
Imho, people there are much nicer and social, you enjoy life so much more than in Northern European countries
Kind of sucks that there's not much job there because that will be for me the best places to live in Europe (with France of course)
Eastern / central Europe
Czech, Slovenia, Poland
Once you speak the local language you can learn the others very easy
They have nice forest ( even if in Poland they enjoy to destroy forests ) and good quality of life
Finland
I really enjoyed traveling there, and, apart from the language, it seems it would quite easy to adopt the local way of doing things in general
The language seems a major PITA to learn tho, and the wife is really, really not into subpolar climates
Sweden seems nice
I would live in Germany just to speak the language
Idk why I love German so much
I would live in the UK if I could and the language wouldn't be a problem so excluding that I guess it would be Norway or Iceland
Austria, i pretty like Wien
When i took their commuter train, I've fallen in love
compared to ours
Germany
I went to Germany a few times, and I really like the country and culture
If Italian politics weren’t that fucked, Italy
But considering Matteo Salvini has a tik tok and I can’t even remember who is the prime minister because they change so often, I’d rather go to Iceland or Denmark
The Netherlands, I spent my summer 2016 there for an internship in Delft and had a great time
I would gladly go back
There is no bad weather, there is only inadequate clothing
Spanish is easy to learn when you speak french
I know of two french people who went to work in Denmark, both fled the place after one year, they couldn't stand the Danish people anymore
and our great shared artists and scientists like Chopin and Marie Curie
[Elle te plait pas ma sœur ?]
That's what a lot of people think, but no
It's very hard to accomodate to another climate
When you've live all your life around the medteranean climate, which is rare around the world, you'll have a hard time living full time somewhere where the air or temperature aren't the same :/
Some fishes, vitamin D and a lot of booze
Yes it does
I'm a Mediterranean guy living in Nantes and I can confirm this
i'm so stupid haha !! i didn't remember there are belgian people who only speak dutch
sorry
at school, i was pretty good for irregular verbs
I'm pretty sure you can find really good friends in Denmark but from what my friends told me is that it was just extremelly hard to socialise with the danish as a foreigner
They ended up feeling really lonely and after trying hard to make friends they just gave up and returned to France
We generally refuse to speak it because it's the language of our ancestral enemy
Lot of french do speak it but often they'll just pretend they don't. Like the flemish when they pretend they don't speak french
Mediteranean Guy living in Toulouse is already a change
It's even more intertwined, from my experience with our school system you'll get mocked if you try too hard in english class, so you mostly learn grammar and vocabulary and you barely speak
Leads to people being shit (or believing they're shit) at speaking english when coming out of school, so they're self conscious about it, they try to avoid speaking english and they never improve
When I moved to London I could write, read, understand english very well but I was mumbling and losing words when I tried to speak
First time I got shitfaced it all unlocked and I was speaking fluently, so it's mostly a mental issue
Many french friends, in London or in France, told me they had the exact same problem
Also we don't work on our accent, natives usually don't understand us when we try to speak with their accent so we instantly revert back to a caricatural french accent that they seem to understand better
Once in Apex Legends
Cancerous team mates insulting in French
Mid game I told them in french to shut the fuck up and next time before saying shit they should check if they are speaking the right language
Assholes
Fun fact: the *only* cancerous team mates I tagged with in Apex were french
Way to go boys
I'm French and American, on a visit to the US we ended up on a bus and a French family was on board and assuming nobody understood (we were with my mother we speak English with) and they were having this very lengthy detailed conversation about family drama, kind of awkward for us
French here, I knew this because one of friends with Spanish roots had one deck, so I played with it once, I think
So I guess it is very uncommon here, and you definitely can't find a deck like that in stores
In France we also have the tarot game that uses it's own special deck of cards
I knew about it because I browse Wikipedia a lot, but I never saw one IRL
Obviously in France we use the international deck
And beware, because there are some differences between a French deck and and American one
Basically a French deck is more rectangles and the American one is more squarish
But the card's designs are the same
In French the card are called:
Hearts: Coeurs
Diamonds: Carreaux (that means a tile/square)
Spades: Pique (a pike)
Clubs: trèfle (a shamrock)
>French deck
Briscola and scopa are the best card games
Many friends of mine come from Italy and we always play when we are at the pub
French have other decks too : tarot
I have one like that
Can’t tell you were it’s from, though, it’s just
always been there
Mysteries of life
My grand mother used to play "Ronda" with the Spanish deck, so it does exist in some part of France
Neither did I.
Me neither and when I went to Wikipedia :
>The most popular standard pattern of the French deck is sometimes referred to as the "International" or "Anglo-American" pattern, but the name recommended by the IPCS is "English pattern".
HEY ! This is so unfair =(
>I didn’t even know the normal ones where french
Is a brit having an epiphany ? Everybody in France knows this, since forever !
That must be why I don't know them
I never lived in the South
Do you know if they also invented the tarot rules ?
I mean, I’m (pretty) sure it came from my grandmother and she never went to Finland, so that seems unlikely but who knows
Maybe one of her friend brought it back for her
Clearly
It's not like restaurant is a french word and concept
The english just forgot that when they eat beef/porc/poultry seated with knife and fork it's french cuisine, or at least some kind of attempt to imitate it, when they eat cow/pig/chicken with their bare hands it's english
Do you think elder people should pass a test to see if they’re still fully able to drive ?
At some age, our vision, attention and reflexes decrease, putting ourselves and other in possible danger
But, removing the right to drive can highly limit the movement of elders people
What do you think of this ?
God yes please
Only if the doctor orders to revoke your license, there’s no driving test or medical test just for driving
It was a genuine question, I did not seek everybody’s agreement, that’s why I wrote two opposite argument in the post
There many way to disagree with this statement : people might not want to loose time passing a test, people might not want to pay for it, etc
You’re free to post any question you want in this sub Reddit if you’re not happy with what’s currently posted
In some countries there is no renewing your license, you get it for life
IIRC, a doctor can only say that you are incapable of driving anymore, but that doesn't suspend your licence automatically, someone (private individuals
the *préfecture*?) then need to act on the doctors opinion to have the licence removed
Also, you can't force people to go see a doctor most of the time: I have personally met a young woman, with several physical handicaps (partial blindness and deafness, violent tremors, etc
) who had been trying to get her licence for years (and failed everytime) but no one could prevent her from trying
Thanks for the info
Had some family members killed by a 69 years old driver who totally got away with it and merrily went on being a threat to other pedestrians
On the other hand, one old uncle of mine got his license snatched from him at 80 years of age by his doctor after he'd checked his terribly bad vision
Being tested is great, I think
Wish someone has the balls to implement that in France
I'll wear a jacket under 23-24°C. Under 20°C, it's getting cold
Under 16-17°C, I usually wear a good jacket and a coat
Under 12°C it's really cold and under 7-8°C it's freezing
I like heat, I feel comfortable between 25 and 34°C.
However quite few french people are the same as me, most would feel good between 15 and 25°C, and cold under 5-10°C
Well I don't wear jackets, so
I haven't started to wear coats yet this year, but it's getting close
probably under 10°C or so
&#x200B;
Parisian region btw, you'd obviously get different answers from people in the South (much warmer) or in the East (much colder)
Below 10°c it's winter coat and scarf, hat only if it's windy
Below 5°c I dive my toddler a hat but not for me
Below 0°c I add glove/hat
Below -10°c I have a warmer coat like I would have to ski but only if I stay outside for a long walk for exemple
I'll start heating my home when the temperature inside goes below 19°C.
I live in Southern France
20°C and for me it starts being cold
It's currently 16° outside, and if I go out without jacket + pullover I will very likely get cold
anything below 20°C without sun and some minor wind is considered cold in France (need a jacket)
In summer I'm always in T-shirt, else I wear a pullover under 15°C, a jacket under 5-10°C and ski pants below -15°C (which didn't happen since 2012 :/)
Living on the mediterranean coast, I'm not used to being cold
So I would say 15°C-12°C : cold (thin jacket), 12° and below : freezing (big coat)
In my city, I never experienced a temperature below 0°C, and that was like 10 years ago
I was wearing a T-Shirt until 2 weeks ago
Chilly weather : under 10°C, down to 5°C if it's humid, down to -5°C if it's dry and no wind
Anything below that is pretty cold, but I don't mind as long as it's not humid
Dry -15°C is nicer than humid and windy 2°C. I'm from the Northeast so I've always been used to it
20C koz Mom told so
Personally, it's more like -20C with a dry weather
I live in Southern France and same
Where is that for in the UK
In London it really never reaches 0, so I'd add 5 degrees to all of these
Wow, and to think that in Paris it rarely ever goes above 25
Where are you based
When you get over 40°C every summer now, you get happy with 24°C, trust me
You weren't lucky
It's quite rare to have negative temperatures in Paris or in western France
And no, oddly I like heat but I live in Britanny xD
Our flat is currently 16
2C, but our mezzanine bedroom is much warmer
Haven't even had the heating on today
Well I just wear more clothes I guess xD, but between April and September we have good temperatures
r/YUROP is leaking again
<3 (if only)
Oh people are waking up, protests are becoming bigger and more violent, but the cops just mutilate protesters and get away with it
Politicians basically then say that police violence doesnt exist in France
Its gonna take a bit of time but I feel theres gonna be something triggering a much bigger protest that's gonna turn into something more
Then
the guillotine lol
&#x200B;
* I use the "warm" LED light bulbs at home, they have a light spectrum that mimics the one from the Sun's spectrum
Not sure how much it helps, but it feels agreeable to me
* I have some indoor hobbies, like recreational coding, cooking, etc
Being at 45 latitude, I feel not very impacted by the shorter days in winter, it feels mild relative to what they experience at 60 latitude
Hot chocolate, hot soups, warm blankets, heavy food
Winter is synonym of coziness and additionnal layers of fat for me
"Avoir des couilles" ( having some balls ) can mean being brave/audacious or a "real man" sometimes
In French it has the same signification as in English
But to say being bored we can say : "J'en ai plein le cul", which means "My ass is full".
And if you are exploring the latin american world, you have all the guevón, aguevonado, gueva,....
Balls may translate by either boules or couilles
Strangely there are not really interchangeable
Avoir des couilles, or alternatively être couillu, as you said, means being brave, being bold
There are other expressions like "poser ses couilles sur la table" ( literally to put one's balls on the table) which means to dare, to go to the limits
But also "en avoir plein les couilles" ( literally to have your balls full), which means to be fed up
Avoir les boules, to me, means more like to be frustrated, to be angry, but I checked the definitions, and yours (to be afraid) is also valid
I have never used it that way
You can also break balls (casser les couilles) to say someone or something is bothering you
Most complete description for the French
True I've forgotten this one
Love it
Sounds so childish it is actually cute
We used to say this also when I was a kid, in South West of France, totally forgot before reading you comment !
Edit : After investigation, it comes from the comedy movie « la tour Montparnasse infernale »
Live in France but next to Geneva, that's the best of both worlds
What is in the exciting cities, banks ?
For the presidential election, no
But for the mayor, yes
I love your political system in Switzerland
same in france ... declining and replace by vaping by youths but still a big thing (might be a bit less than germany but pretty similar)
"Only" 25% daily smokers in France where tobacco is very expensive, packs are all the same with horror pictures on it and its generally considered a very bad habit even though teenagers keep thinking it's cool
People in their 30s like me are desperately trying to quit
So forget the cliché.
Everyone knows it's bad, but everyone does it anyway
Related question: how common smoking electronic cigaret is in your country
Why I feel like I see personally is that a lot of young people are smoking cigarettes but the older generation has switched to vaping
Young people vape as well but I feel like that’s what I’ve noticed
Found some [figures] Apparently, 11% of the population in France smokes at least occasionally, and that proportion rises up to 32% for people aged 18 to 75
We still have the 4th highest proportion of smokers in Europe
If you rule elderly and young people out of the equation, I imagine it becomes a lot
Even 22% means 1 out of 5 person (including children and seniors) smokes
Edit: checked the numbers in France, it’s 11% over the whole population, but 32% for people between the age of 18 and 75
Quite a significant increase
well here in France a pack is 10€ so it is becoming very very expensive, while vaping you can have it on internet, with no nicotine for 4€/bottle
I am 23 and pretty much everyone I know smokes
I wish I had never started
Most people I know including me smoke Belgian tobacco, it still is 5€ when you cross the border
Same for me
Well in Paris you don't have that option only Chinese crap at 5€ but with anything else but tobacco
My wife is French, so that is the big thing
We married in the states and moved back after a few years
But what initially got me thinking about France was my aunt and uncle moved here before I was born and I learned to love France and Europe as a whole
I moved to France last year and would not dream of leaving
I've done a language program in Lyon and am now doing my Master in Paris
Plenty of things to see and do around the whole country, food is fantastic, and people have been warm and welcoming as opposed to their unfortunate (and clearly misplaced) stereotype
Travel is easy, cheap and convenient as well
And I have a lovely girlfriend here who I can't imagine leaving, we've made France our home
I can't yet speak of employment as I have only recently begun my job search but covid-19 has really stuck a nail into that for the moment
I would be open to living in other European countries, depending on employment opportunities, but unless I fall in love with them like I have with France I'll be looking to stay in beautiful France
You're a splendid story teller =)
I hope you'll enjoy France and what our country has to offer
Did you decide in which region you'll move yet
I hope you'll enjoy Paris but don't be discouraged if you don't, it is quite different to the province
After 10 years away, I moved back to France with my British husband and the one condition I had was to not move to Paris (I am not a fan and I knew he wouldn't like it there)
We're in the Vosges which is a pretty nice area for now
You might like Lille in the North, lovely city, very friendly people
Cool, which uni ?
Will you live in cité universitaire ? The one with crazy buildings
Please don't listen to this "french people are rude, they don't speak English" bullshit
A lot of foreigners actually complain that we switch to English too often
I wish you the best
It's seen as a big city yes with most jobs, I'd say of all European capitals London and Paris might be quite close in what they are
Supposedly the new Paris in France is Lyon
You could also try that
I haven't. I looked for a bit of nature after the big cities of China
It's a bit particular now but I love the fact that local farmers are so loved by the community where I am and how easy it is to get good, reasonably priced local products
People who say or write «viva la France».
«Viva» is freaking Spanish, in French it's «vive».
Tourists saying "France is so beautiful, I love France" but they've only been to Paris
Although being a compliment, generally it triggers most French outside Paris, and they will go like :
"You should come to Lozère, this is real France ! Not that filthy place filled with Parisians
Not saying Bonjour makes a french person automatically ruder
Omelette du fromage
The only "Italians" who care if you put cheese in your carbonara are Americans of italian descent
Asian people: NEITHER DID VIKINGS
Slovakia is Nagymagyarország change my mind
Yeah, many in France do that
When my family does, I'm always telling them to not say "hollandais" but "néerlandais".
Wait till you learn that the Netherlands are called "Hollandia" in Hungarian
I mean, Marie Curie and Chopin were French as well as Polish
> Marie Curie or Chopin were French
Oh yeah, if either of those are mentioned anywhere on Reddit the comments will be nothing but poles endlessly insulting France
I mean they both adopted the French nationality
By all accounts they *became* French and were French at the time of their death
Pretending they didn't is kind of insulting their life choices
>"Marie Curie or Chopin were French"
Sure they are lol
I wish I had enough money to buy you an award but take this instead
>	You absolutely have to queue
You can’t push in
You can leave a friend in a queue and go off for a bit, as long as you have made everyone else in the queue aware of what you’re doing so when you come back, they know you’re not pushing in
I want this in France
I hate when someone is doing the queue for all his friends / family
I've had many times Wiener Schnitzels in Vienna and they always asked if I wanted sauce
I think it's even harder for us because moreover flags are similar and the similarity between Slovakia and Slovenia is common in many languages while Austria/Australia is only struggling for English speakers
I think replacing the B with a P of Bretzel could come from Alscace in France
Here they got a language pretty close to german, but thet have an accent which replaces B with P.
They are both, they were immigrants and couldn't have achieved what they did without being both
It's unfair to forget about one country or the other
This is exactly what I'm saying lol don't they teach you at school where do Native Americans come from
Wait till they learn it means "the German Plain" lmao
Copying my answer to another comment :
> They offered me ketchup
I don't know if that's the issue but it was a Schnitzel inside some bread (Kaiser- something), so maybe they did it because it was sort of a sandwich
It was a small streed foot kind of meal, I was poor and a student
I mean I lived there but they might have thought so
They offered me ketchup
I don't know if that's the issue but it was a Schnitzel inside some bread (Kaiser- something), so maybe they did it because it was sort of a sandwich
It was a small streed foot kind of meal, I was poor and a student
Indeed, my bad
Alright yeah, that was it
It's still a schnitzel though isn't it
Of course they didn't taste exactly amazing as they were poor quality but I had to eat something
Haha can't remember but yeah that's the kind of place it was
we are the second biggest consumers of Mac Donald’s in the world after the United States
France’s longest border is with Brazil
Oh, wow, let's be twin countries
here in France people are sewing masks at home to gift them to those who care for the elderlies in nursing homes
I don't think you even know what is Fascist state
I'm from southern France and I think 10% is still too high
It's 5% at most
I'd wager something like 1-2%.
Even 10% is unrealistically high
The reality is nowhere near that
Maybe 1%. And foreign tourists do it much more than the French
Same with naturism, most naturists in French resorts are Dutch and German
Also France is one of the European countries where breastfeeding mothers are the most reluctant to breastfeed in public
I wouldn't be surprised if creepy male comments are the main reason for that
France is definitely well past its hippie phase
There are boobs on TV but not on the beach
1/3 for France is just insane
I've already spent weeks at the beach in summer without seeing any woman topless
From what I've seen, I'd say that even 5% would be a high number
1 out of 3 for France is completely ludicrous
1 out of 10 already seems pretty high to me
That's interesting, in France middle aged women are actually more likely to be topless than younger women are
Depends on the job really, my first job I was at 2200€/m but 50h/week on average
Then imagine it takes you 13 hours (I'm even exaggerating)
You would pay 60€ for each hour of construction
Unless you're super rich, that's at least twice your wage
There isn't a limit for the cadre status so yeah it's legal
Some status have a 35h weekly charge, but you can work more than that and there's a bonus
I think there's a limit for them
But for us, no, nothing
It's usually management positions
By law the standard is 35h.
If you work more you have more paid vacation and/or more pay up to a maximum but there are tons of condition around it so I won't translate it sorry :
You have technically no limit but full time was 39h, it's now 35h and it could have been 28h if the proposition was accepted
Basically above 35 hours per week you get 100% of your supposed wage
That's how it is here too, we get 1 or more days off a month
From my point of view, it's a very inappropriate behavior
I've got no issue with anything past Chaucer (Chaucer is actually quite pleasant due to the orthography being closer to Middle French)
Old English is just as obscure as Old Norse, Old German or Gothic to me as I'm not particularly trained with Germanic languages
Old english is closer to germanic langages
But then William the Bastard invaded England from France and was crowned king
He brought with him a lot of old French
That explains the gap between old english and middle and early modern english
I can understand Early modern and middle, and not all the words of Scots
Me reading the early modern English:
M'kay, i can almost read it perfectly without problems
Me reading the Old and Oldest English:
What
France is celebrating how they took over a prison to steal weapons
14th of July
When I was a kid in the 1980s, we would celebrate St John's day (la fête de la Saint Jean) with a huge bonfire on June 24
It was originally a pagan ritual to celebrate the harvest
However it seems to have completely disappeared
Every 8 december at night in my city (Lyon), everyone put some candles on our windows
The story:
\- 1643 the black plague arrived and people started to pray Mary to help them
It worked so they started to celebrate her every years to thanks her
\- 1852 they even made a huge golden statue of her, placed it on the basilique on the hill above the city and it was supposed to be inaugurate the semptembre 8th but the weather was bad
They tried again on the december 8th
Weather still bad, but they had wait enough and still put candles (luminions) on their windows
Now it's still celebrating, in private schools kids are making their own luminion each years
\- 1989: we started to illuminate all the city by creating the "fête des Lumières" (the light celebration) with light shows projected on buildings, music, light art in the streets and a big "merci Marie " or "Ave Maria", it depend, on the hill etc
first only that night and then it became so popular that it started to last 3 to 4 days and attract millions of people each year
=> just google "fete des lumieres, lyon".
Fun story : I was doing an internship in a Swedish primary school around Lucia time, and the students went to sing in several places in the neighborhood
When they went to sing in the retirement home, the gingerbread boys (who were dressed up in brown to imitate gingerbread) were distributing candies to the elders
One of the elders who either had a good sense of humor or didn't have all of her head, tried to bite one of the gingerbread boys
Former President François Hollande [
I'd say our former president François Hollande in this [discours aux Philippines] said the worst
But Emmanuel Macron said something like "your wife is delicious" to someone very important
A very famous terrible English sentence by former prime Minister Raffarin about the European constitution [link]
It was used as lyrics for a satirical song when he has dismissed, in the style of [Cobain's last days ]
François Hollande with Elon Musk
EDIT : this one is great too : [
PM Raffarin will be hard to beat
You can not beat our former president of the Republic, François Hollande
Well, i can't imagine better for Tirol
How about some classic Raffarin
"Because you can be do what you want to do"
Beautiful ️
This
There are longer versions of speeches in India, but these few seconds are enough to understand the extent of the problem
That's exactly what popped immediatly in my mind lol
It became a meme in France just after the speech
Iconic !
Hahaha I had forgotten about this, I was going to offer [this]
He speaks very good French though
He still sounds the same
I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this
Raffarin is an old time classic now
I love how self-confident he looks while saying that
Same, it's literally the first thing that came to my mind when I read the OP
Pls stop saying that i'm old it hurts
Surement une question de génération
Hollande m'est directement venu en tête (j'ai 21 ans), alors que Raffarin
Kids in France are forced to learn english and do not have the option of refusing
French kids are required to spend years learning English
Besides the collaboration with Nazi Germany of then government of France in the second world war or the colonization and enslavement of people from Africa, i don't quite see
Algeria war I suppose
France at the time did not consider Algeria as a colony but as a part of mainland France since there was no Algeria before we went there (it was a place where various local clans lived from attacking European ships and selling their passengers into slavery)
As a result the government of the time was adamant that even if France lost all its colonies Algeria would remain french since for them Algeria was France
When a pro independence movement called FLN started blowing up shit left and right to force France to give them a referendum France reacted by sending troops with the objective of « bringing back order ». The troops sent there were composed of a core of hardened paratroopers who tended to be very nationalistic and of young conscripts who were not sure what they were doing there
Ensued a years long campaign against an insurgency where French army controlled  the countryside during the day and the FLN controlled it during the night
Villages which helped the French were therefore slaughtered and razed during the night and the villages which helped the FLN were slaughtered and razed during the day
The more violent one side became and the more violent the other side became
At some point napalm starting being used by France under the name « special barrels » because since it was officially still an operation to keep order in a French département they really couldn’t tell the public that they were going to such extremes
In 1958 De Gaulle is elected and decides that enough is enough and organizes a referendum calling Algerian people, mainland French people and oversea French people to vote
The result are overwhelmingly positive with 75% of voters voting in favour of auto determination for Algeria
Vichy
Most people would say Vichy or WW2 collaboration
I would however take a reminder that the French Army was sometimes ruthless during the napoleonic era
There is a famous date in Spanish history :  ***El tres de mayo de 1808 en Madrid
***
Basically, when the french occupied Spain in 1808, insurgents tried to fight back
This resistance was repressed in the blood
While many spanish citizen died fighting the french army during this episode,  patriotics and resistants prisoners where then massacred by the french army during the "Tres de Mayo", the 3 May 1808, for no other reason than to send a message to the population
It's worth noticing the uprising was not that huge and popular in the first place
The slaughter of the citizens and resistants on Tres de Mayo backfired hard, and would later encourage the spanish people to fight even more and harder against the french, who were now seen as cruels and evil, where they were tolerated occupants at first
&#x200B;
And there is Massacre de la Saint-Barthélémy,  St
Bartholomew's Day massacre, les Guerres de vendées
Well
We had our fair share of citizens slaughter
Lots of things
Let's start with the Revolution
Robespierre killed all his opponents
Napoléon Bonaparte was a bloodthirsty dictator, but for some reason he's still viewed as a national hero
The colonial empire, that allowed to keep some form of slavery despite the Constitution
WW1
WW2, Philippe Pétain and the deportations
The Indochina War, that led to the Vietnam War
The Algeria War
Nuclear tests in Polynesia and Algeria
Forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people, which was a regular thing at least until the 1990s. Refugees being locked up in "centers" (more like Russian style prisons), both adults and kids, before being deported by force to their death in Iraq / Afghanistan / whatever
I probably forgot to include a few more things, sadly
>The Triangle Slave trade
Almost every western European nation did it
I didnt even had heard about it before, yikes
It's bad but 'OP' asked for "most horrible atrocities" so i don't believe it's scale up to the other example i gave
And during the Sainte Barthélemy
Most of our protestants went in Germany after that
Where we should start
We might be the champion of shitty ugly messed-up decolonization processes
The colonies, the slave trade, fucking over Indian tribes in America, I dunno
I know the feeling
There might be some idiom but « avoir le seum » comes to my mind
It’s slang but also kinda common amongst youths and young adults and means that you are frustrated by some thoughts or unfortunate outcomes
Grasse matinée. (Fat morning)
In France, you just stay in bed slowly drinking your coffee or what ever
Read a book, or make love
Then, you get drunk at 'aperitif' time (noon), or not
We usually call it "blues du dimanche soir" or "déprime du dimanche soir".
Чёрт is outdated ?
Ah yeah "blues du dimanche soir" sounds right somehow
Nah, I know our litterature has made a lot ouf of this word but ennui is just boredom in common french
La Transhumance- basically a Provençal (Mediterranean coast of France) tradition
Two times a year, the sheep are led in the mountains and back, in summer
They are led through the Provençal cities, you can see the roads flooded by sheep
There is traditional music and costumes, eating and stuff
_We want our Ratatouille back
It's a traditional dish around here
Fête du Roi de l’Oiseau
It is basically a renaissance festival with costumes and dancing and food but the whole town of Le Puy is involved and it is very fun
It is from the 16th century, so not quite ancient but it is still a main event every September for 5 days
Definitely the Épiphanie (6th of January, where we eat "galette des rois" which is an absolutely tasteful pie with almonds and somewhere in the pie is hidden a little figurine, and the person who gets it will get a crown), we also have Chandeleur (6th of February, that's the day of crêpes) and Saint-Nicolas (6th of December, which is only celebrated in the Northeast of France and surrounding regions abroad and it's a kind of pre-Christmas where (according to the legend) the brother of Santa Claus comes to your house and gives you candy if you were wise during the year, while his mad brother will give your parents a stick of wood to beat their children if they weren't wise -- of course it's just to affray the children and no one does it for real)
I also like how it's all on the 6th of something
I'm just forgetting the traditional egg hunt on Easter Day but I think that's pretty common
Do you celebrate something related to Attila too
I had the chance of celebrating Līgo back in 2014
It was awesome
The Finno-Ugric seems pretty accurate, as I know pretty good the bases of Hungarian I just started to learn Finnish and it seems much easier, there's the same system of cases, the same way to express the possession (no verb for to have but a periphrase with to be) and some similar words (menni/mennä seems to be the best example)
Hi, I'm a French person who doesn't eat cheese or drink wine
A French who can't be grumpy, ever
A French that is satisfied with the government
I have a French friend who doesn't eat cheese
I'm a french that doesn't eat cheese
I'm french and guess what ?
I don't like Paris !
A French that doesn't complain
Vegan French dude here️ I feel this is a job for me
A French person who doesn’t like bread would be even worse !
C'est tellement tragique
tu sais, si tu rencontres des problèmes en ce moment, tu peux en parler
Il n'est jamais trop tard Teproc
Yeah that’s terrible
If I was told I would have to never eat cheese ever again I would probably lose the will to live
I don't like cheese either, but in a truly french way, I compensate with copious amounts of wine
Believe me, we are at least 10
Truly unthinkable
A french person who doesn't like Nutella would be wild
Mais tellement
Le fromage c'est la vie comme dirait l'aut'.
People support them when they are in their best interests
When paid leave got created in 1936 no one demonstrated
I'll be glad to great you too in English:)
And I'll be happy to help if you need to talk to non English speaker
now don't go too far
I prefer Nocciolata !
French person who prefers peanut butter here ! And la Chocolade
And I don't like bread either, btw
I don’t. It’s garbage
Rather eat straight butter on my bread
We just eat a lot of it
I mean
a LOT
Le bon fromage si on en mange souvent ça peut revenir cher quand même
Ça m’arrêtera pas d’en manger mais bon
Nope
Not as much in the UK for example
Bread really is a big part of our food culture
Yes, there are a lot of countries where there’s a big bread culture
Die Sonne : Le Soleil
Der Mond : La Lune
It's reversed for us
The opposite of you : Moon is female and Sun is male
Now that I am thinking about it, maybe it is because of our far greek/latin heritage
In these cultures, Moon had a godDESS who was Selene but the Sun had a GOD who was Appolo
Maybe this is the reason why
It seems to correspond to Appolon, greek god of the sun, and Artemis, greek godess of the moon
Earth being female and sky being male might be related to Gaia and Ouranos
And the Taoist concept of Yin/Yang put the Moon and women on the Yin side as opposed to sun and men on the yang side
Hahaha depends if it's Greek or Roman I think
I'd go with 1871-1914, maybe because that was the comeback from hell
1871 => Paris is revolting and is anarchist, Germany occupy more than a third of the country for a few years, repayment of war which were the highest to ever happen (at that point in time), loss of the most industrious region, humiliation in Versailles and complete diplomatic isolation
1914 => Second biggest and richest Empire on the Planet, stable internal situation with amazing social progress comparatively to most of the planet, a solid alliance with Russia and a decently solid one with the UK (which was a millennium long opponent, so no small deal that one alliance), insane cultural influence on the world stage (most of your cliché on Paris and France are from that era), industrialization going smoothly despite the lack of resources compared the UK or Germany, scientifically comparable to the top dogs with a ton of "great scientist", and the quality of living was rising sharply
It ended in the worst way possible though
It depends your definition of golden age
Some might say something like 16th to 18th century, but I'd say *Les trente glorieuses* (the glorious thirty)
The period of economic growth between the 40s and 60s.
We've never been this close again from full employment etc
If we go with italy as a concept, I guess your roman empire was not too bad of a golden age either
Oh you guys use Grosso modo too ?
Neat to know
Wait has the french history curriculum changed in the last decade
I remember there having been 3 periods described as a "golden age" in french historiography:
- 1180 to 1314 which encompassed the reign of the "Three Great Direct Capetians" (Philip Augustus, Saint Louis and Philip the Fair): our medieval golden age and rise as the wealthiest and most powerful christian kingdom following the Battle of Bouvines in 1214
- The "Grand Siècle" or "Great Century" (the 17th century)
we were freshly out of the french wars of religion, huguenots rebellions crushed under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, weakening of the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years' War and France's rise to the top once again as Europe's greatest power during Louis XIV's long reign
- The First French Empire (1803-1812)
No explanation needed
France emerged as Europe's greatest power in all those periods
politically, culturally and militarily speaking that is
Socially (as in life for the people living in France during those periods), I don't know if the average Frenchman saw any improvment in his day to day life due to said golden ages but I remember having read a great famine hitting the country twice during the reign of Louis XIV though and a shit load of people dying
So it must not have been all that "glorious" for the commoners lol
There was the "Belle Époque" you talked about as well (1871-1914)
Life improved greatly for the people, high industrialization, progressivism, art, science, culture
all flourished
But we were no longer the top dogs by that point
The British Empire and the German Empire were above us on the power spectrum
even the US in some ways (industrial output and economy) was ahead of us
and Russia was rapidly industrializing as well
So I don't know if you can call that a golden age
I don't personally
I can't describe any period in which France isn't n°1 but below other european powers, rivals such as the UK and Germany nonetheless, as a "golden age". Embarrassing
lmao
Also, the times of Louis XIV
Like
Ok it was a monarchy, but France was kind of the ultimate boss, especially in terms of arts, at the time
For the same reason, the 19th century before the 1870 war
Yup it was the first republican experiment for France that didn’t end in another revolution or a coup d’état
Probably the period that really anchored what France was about and which paved the way for what it is today
I just googled it and it seems that it's Latin, but I always thought it was French AND informal
I mean yeah sure, we weren't the big bully of Europe, but I put more emphasis on the whole :
> high industrialization, progressivism, art, science, culture
all flourished
Than the ability of France to kick yet another coalition ass (those time make for fascinating moment/story though)
Too many war for Louis XIV and too unstable for before the 1870 war for my taste, but I see why one could defend those two
I didn't express myself very well in the precedent post, sorry, I meant to say that France *owned* more than anyone but the UK, France had a quarter of the world capital (iirc the UK had a bit more than 30%)
Most of the revenue came from France owning massive amount of other countries industry, for example most of the Russian railway and a decent chunk of their arms manufacturers of the time was built on French fund
(It was also thanks to this massive capital that France managed to stay in the war economically speaking
France owned a lot of American industry for example meaning from the get-go France production for the war was split into multiple area and that France could mobilize a greater portion of it's population without destroying it's industry
I chose my words poorly before, again sorry
Sure but France never dominated the continent in such a fashion before
in fact nobody did what Napoleon did in Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire
The only thing close to it until that was Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire
Ok this shit is getting quite hilarious
The Italians are even making things up to be mad about now regarding the French
Who the hell hails France as the heir of Rome
I've only heard such statements come from the British online (and rarely enough for it to not be considered a big deal)
There have been some historians who drew a parallel between France and Rome on one side with England/Britain and Carthage on the other to describe their rivalry and that's about it
> Many in Europe referred to Great Britain as "Perfidious Albion", suggesting that it was a fundamentally untrustworthy nation
People compared Britain and France to ancient Carthage and Rome, respectively, with the former being cast as a greedy imperialist state that collapsed, while the latter was an intellectual and cultural capital that flourished
A little quote from "That Sweet Enemy" by Tombs in reference to the anglo-french rivalry:
> The republicans knew as well as the Bourbons that British control of the oceans weighed in Continental power politics, and that France could not dominate Europe without destroying Britain
"Carthage"—vampire, tyrant of the seas, "perfidious" enemy and bearer of a corrupting commercial civilization—contrasted with "Rome", bearer of universal order, philosophy and selfless values
>not even France, as they claim they are
Lol what
No one claims that
It seems that we're living rent free in your head however
Well, names are often adapted to the local language, so that particular critic is not really valid (we say Jules Cesar, and not Julius Caesar for instance)
France was big on church stuff at some point also,but it had nothing to do with the Roman empire, which for us is definitely an Italian empire
Damn Elisa
You need to chill sister
Haha What the hell is the deal with Italians
Reading posts and comments here and r/europe made me realize so many of you seem to have a problem with us and it's absolutely hilarious because of how one-sided the whole thing is
You guys even manage to see the French "stealing" from Italy in instances as ridiculous as this
lol
I guarantee you that nobody considers any of the people you listed to be French
Their names have simply been "frenchified" as it is done in many other languages
You probably have many french historical figures whose names have been adapted to the italian language as well (Joachim Murat for example
Not too sure)
Calling Julius Ceasar "Jules César" or Leonardo da Vinci "Léonard de Vinci" isn't us trying to make them French, neither are the Germans calling french kings (named Louis or Charles) "Ludwig" and "Karl" trying to make them Germans
WTF
Oh by the way "Eldest Daughter of the Church" (or also "Most Christian King" as one of the many titles of the kings of France) is a title which has been given to the Kingdom of France by the Papacy, iirc
I do know we can have our obnoxious moments but yeah
turns out the French weren't completely a bunch of rude arrogant assholes with delusions of grandeur
A couple of people outside of France also thought we were pretty cool lmao
Are italians this sensitive
Those are just translated names calm down
Why wouldn't you
Filthy offspring of the Perfidious Albion
Pretty badass description tho I agree lol
>Eh yes, a lot of french redditors say “we don’t care about italians
I mean it is true
This rivarly our two countries apparently have is really one sided
People don't really think about Italy this side of the alps
Or have any strong opinions about it
Most people like the food and the architecture
Of course people notice similarities and will think about the italianw as "cousins"but that's about it
Fair point about the stolen art, I suppose you should focus on it instead of the Mona Lisa
And I won't approve of anything created by that goblin, Sarkozy
But you're not alone, it seems the Spanish think more about us than we do and the same goes for the english
>The problem is that you still claim to be (even if you don't say it, you think it cause you have been a superpower and your economy is pretty strong)
As I said rent free
No politician is claiming that and I've never known anyone who claimed that
Obviously in the past, yes like most european coutries as you said
But currently nah, hell the french government has been pushing the "our gaulish ancestors" narrative for decades now
>it's absolutely hilarious because of how one-sided the whole thing is
That's the problem
If this is one-sided, you should have ignored both of them, and avoid the unnecessary condescending tone
You did waste your time
I have come accross many of Elisa's comments here before and I've never had any altercation with her prior to this because at least her other complaints were reasonably coherent (italian stuff France looted during wars throughout the ages or political matters like Libya)
The whole name thing baffled me that much yes as did the claim to be the heir of Rome
that's why I decided to answer
My goal wasn't to be condescending and if that's the way it appeared, my dearest apologies
The laughter and "WTF
" moment I was having reading her comment and trying to answer to it may have been transmitted through my reply lol
Did she seriously call me Jean Paul instead of Pierre or Antoine
Pfff
Disappointed
See if you had brought up the Gioconda, italian stuff France looted, Corsica or whatever, I would have just had the habitual hearty chuckle and moved on
The name thing is the most ridiculous and hilarious of all the complaints I've heard so far but hey whatev's.
Oh and a little advice cousins
Just so you know
You'll have to try a bit harder if you want to kick off an actual rivalry between us, not that lightweight stuff you've been doing so far lol
Taking a page out of England or Germany's book and invading us to take your stuff back could be a good start or having the audacity to pull that shit you pulled in 2006 ever again hahaha
Good, translating names is a very common practice
Good to see it's just that one person getting weirdly angry at normal things
>It seems that you want to make pass them as french
Nah I'm pretty sure we just translated names
>(like that idiot controversy about leonardo da vinci, though i know it wasn’t a serious thing)
The average guy knows they’re italian, but with a french name it sounds subconsciously like if they were french, **somehow**.
Yes, because they're translated
>Maybe we should change french names too, Voltèro sounds so good
Sure, go do that
It was bought by Francis I. It is a well known fact in France
It is rightful french property, so is Corsica, which was bought from Genoa and pacified
Maybe not you, but I came accross the occasional wild italian who includes both in his list of "stuff France stole from Italy", that's why I listed them
Anyway, I think I'll end my contribution to the circus here lol
Have a great evening
I mean you knida imagined that translating italian names in french was some sort of nefarious plot to claim famous italians as french so I'd describe that as kinda weird but alright
A friend and I went to Italy a few years ago
We decided to rent an Airbnb in Genova to be in the city center
The owner came to meet us at the train station and we walked to the place
Maybe a hundred meters from the flat, he stops, looks at me and say in English "now you walk fifty meters behind me and pretend you don't know me
They are supposed to know I rent this flat". It was his friends flat
We were not to do any noise in the flat, on the 7th floor of the building (with no lift
), We could use the giant terrace at night and not talk to the neighbors
We spent our three nights barely sleeping because we thought someone would come and kick us out
Plus, Italians were not the friendliest and Milano at night was scary
I didnt look at the reviews so it's kinda my fault, but once in Madrid i booked an hôtel, the receptionnist didnt spoke english and she used Google translate to check me in (wtf)
Then i she showed my room which was like at the end of the road from the reception
Inside was gross, the sheets weren't changed
The other people there looked ok at first and not mean or anything but damn judging by their faces i wouldnt be surprised it they took drugs ( and the neighbourhood was full or drug addicts
) And also we couldnt close the door ?? So like everybody could come inside say a hi during a night
Needless to say i didnt slept there at all, huge waste of money though
And when i wanted to check out the next day, the receptionnist wasnt there on time, i waited like 30mn and an other client check me out
Fucking hell
I was so angry at myself to not have been carefull enough
Sadly our hospital are most of the time in overwhelmed, if you got something like this happening again, try to call the 15 if it's urgent, it's sadly the only fast option
I hope you where able to find some pleasure at least in our country
There are several public hospitals in Paris that are open 24/7
They can't legally close
Even when striking, they can't stop working
I don't think you went to an ER
It sounds like you tried going to clinics, which aren't ERs
Shut up or he'll start insulting you as well
Let a Norwegian do the job
In my city, two drunk guys kidnapped a Lama from a circus and paraded it around in the tramway
They called him Serge the Lama (after one of our singers who's called Serge Lama)
In my city we had the original "he bought a PS4 by weighting it in the fruit section".
He came back the day later to do it again but he was caught
You now have a new goal, a higher calling
When buying fruits / vegetables in bulk, you weigh them in the store and the scale prints a price barcode to put on the bag with the produce, and that get scanned at checkout
The guy put such a barcode on the PS4, and scanned it at the self-checkout: so he bought a PS4 for the price of a bunch of fruits
Usually, there are employees making sure it doesn't happen, but he managed to get through this time
But they saw him later on camera, and when that moron came back to do it again
he was caught
Yeah, it's usually the case in France too but I guess in not all supermarkets then ...
As a French
Only places I can think of would be Britanny
But most of the country gets absolutely overrun with tourists (even the Massif Central) every year
Maybe the Pyrenees when it's not skiing season
Basically inner France except Paris and the southeast
Sure Provence is good but invaded by tourists in the summer, except a few areas in the Provençal highlands
The Pyrenees, the massif central region and the less populated departments' prefectures are a great place to visit, most of it isn't targeted by tourists
Edit : I mean in summer season
So traveling alone in Sicily without being able to speak Italian is actually safe
Been tempted to do that for a while
My thoughts exactly
Tourists-free places are so rare, we really shouldn't ruin them by exposing them on the Internet
Okay, thanks for the tips
Especially the cathedral and its famous 123-metre spire
Russian - not the most used language but because it is rare, you will be in high demand
Better to operate in a pool with less competition
German would probably be most useful here, in addition to French (obviously number 1 priority if you work in France) and English
One of the biggest trading partner
Working in banks in France, I've encountered more german and italian than any other languages
Spanish just after
We definitely speak English with all of them though
Regarding russian that is often mentioned in this thread : never encountered anything related to Russia in my experiences so I'll say that if you work in banks, you don't have to care about learning russian
Except maybe if you work in private Banking sector with those rich russians that are many in Paris to spend their cash and be safer that if they stayed in Russia
Probably spanish, since it is spoken in the majority of south america
French is also useful if you want to work in Africa since it is spoken a lot there
That's not a reason not to learn the language of the country you're working in
Russian
Not really sure about this
One more vote for Russian - because not many people speak it compared to English/German/French, you will have less competition and be in higher demand
German is much, much easier than any Romance language for a native English speaker
I'm learning Hungarian and I just started Finnish uwu
I encountered the styrian Dialekt when I went to österreich
Man ….
"I hob es nie gmocht" I heard
Couldn't even guess what was behind that sentence without the hochdeutsch translation … And I even speak some german …
Was surprised nobody really spoke English in that area though, especially when in France, we think that we are the shittiest English speakers and everywhere else everyone is 100% fluent
I had to use my completely rusty German but I managed o/
We probably will not need to speak chinese during our life
Chinese soft power doesn't really exist and very very few people learn mandarin outside China
The ratio between native speakers and outsiders learning their language is very very low compared to English, French and Spanish
They will all learn English before we will all learn mandarin
95% of speakers are in Russia and Ukraine
It’s rare outside the countries where it’s spoken natively
Ah ok
And no, here it'd be rather German
I guess I'm not convinced German grammar is so much more complex than French or even Spanish grammar, that the huge vocabulary advantage you get from learning a language within your linguistic family is offset by that
Granted, English has a fair amount of Romance influence through French, but still
It's actually cool if you're involved in it you know
Many people think like you while they never heard a single word in Hungarian, Finnish or Estonian
I find these languages very pretty
I was in Kindberg and there nobody spoke english I met
They were mostly indeed 40 or smth
But the pharmacian I saw there was smth like 25-30 and didn't as well
But yeah, in Graz, young ppl I talked with were speaking english
If you plan to work in tourism or with China's companies, yes
Otherwise it's not important
I may be influenced by my personal work, but working in the financial sector you don't need at all to speak chinese since you'll never encounter chinese things
Except if you work in HK of course (which is currently in a good way of losing its status btw)
Except if you have a business that has some factories in China, it's probably better to learn German or Spanish in the EU than mandarin
Also, the chinese market is huge compared to nearly all countries, but it's only one country, against a whole "cultural world" we call "the west" with the EU and USA where english is the standard
Also, the soft power there is 150 234 092x (according to a study based on a survey on 1 person, me) more powerful than the chinese one
> you definitely can't deny the potential for Mandarin to be the lingua franca
Well, for now, there is no sign of it
Chinese culture doesn't export and since the rise of the economic power of China it has been as a mimic to the western (american) culture
Also with the political system there, it doesn't attract much westerners except those who wants to do business
Which may still change regarding the usual growth pattern which is high as long as you are behind the "norm" of the rich countries
China's growth will lower too
Also, the language is completely different with another alphabet so not too much ppl would want to learn it
People struggle already learning german, so mandarin …
At the moment, nothing suggest that this may change in the near future
China is a big country with a big economy, but the "west" is still bigger in every way
Especially regarding the soft power which is more important than economy for the spread of the language
The current most useful language, yes
And we don't need it that much
Besides, learning it at a proficient level is one of the first steps to assimilation and that's not going to happen
Ask some Dutch, Swedes, even the Britons themselves because that has little to do with them anymore
>because of the british
Because of the Americans
Until the next one
Do you think she'd agree to help me
Thank you for your input, it's interesting
>I had experiences and travelled through France, it’s not about politics it’s about living in a world where not everyone knows french
It's about living/working/visiting a country named France where everyone should know a bit of French
These are our lands, our culture, our rules
Tourists need to adapt to it, and not the other way round
If you're not pleased with this, you can go and visit somewhere else, the world is vast
May I get her username please
Okay no problem it's just I've be looking for weeks to find someone that could help me :/
- Danish is the butt joke of every jokes about languages up in the North
- That sink cabinet thing that only exists in Finland and Italia
- While teaching English in pretty much almost every non-English-speaking countries, Dora teaches Spanish in Romania
One time someone asked about what one could do in their city, and a German person's answers was at least 5 paragraphs long (with bullet points)
Belgium roads (at least in Wallonia) are worse than the roads in northern Italy
But they will say at least their highways are illuminated, and that if in France this is not the case, it is because we think we are brights
(I don’t know if it is the best translation of their joke, and if it make sense in English
A party and a cake with candles on it and that's it
Everyone awkwardly sings happy birthday while you're blowing out the candles, and if you're unlucky someone knows happy birthday in another language and it lasts even longer (ex: French and English, sometimes German)
The cake and the gifts are the only things that separates a birthday party from a regular party
I live at the border and everytime I go to Belgium I see those big ass signs saying "xxx deaths on walloon roads this year" yeah YOU DON'T SAY
Have you *seen* your roads
Nah not Paris
Hmmm
I'm used to hear people making fun of french stereotypes and of the french accent but not the language itself
Anyway I kinda agree, spanish or italian and even English sounds soo much better than french (it's a bit monotone I think)
That joke made me laugh a lot at least !
Who is the most hated person in your country's history ?
In France, it would probably be Phillipe Pétain or Pierre Laval, both collaborated during the occupation in WW2 and are seen as traitors
Some diehard nationalists like my cousins really like Pétain for some reason
Maréchal Pétain who was the French president during the Nazi invasion
He basically just instaured antisemite and nazi laws and is who I personally think of first when the word “collabo” (French slang for collaborator) comes up
Edit: didn’t see the description of the question lol but yeah it was already mentioned haha
Klaus Barbie also !
Harald Schumacher
On a more serious note, Harald Schumacher
No seriously, Marechal Petain, probably
Typical French rise and fall story
I am not sure Pétain is the most hated (due to the WW1)
I find that really interesting that you guys don’t like Éamon De Valera
As the first president (I think that’s correct but not 100% sure) you’d think he was popular
Could you explain the hate pls
ni oubli ni pardon
I never knew about the shootings, only the bombing
It wasn't know to me until I saw Netflix's 22 July which is a good movie
The meme is even better considering that his name literally means "of the hole"
He didnt really have a chance to begin with
This
I may receive a lot of hate by the brits for this but having seen many of his interviews, he does come out as impulsive and very confrontational (and difficult to deal with) but he makes a lot of correct points and debates in a fair way compared to some Americans who basically rely on fallacies
I'd rather have Piers than a 'yes-sir' kind of TV figure who doesn't contest anything that's being said in a morning talk show for the sake of following a boring repetitive protocol
Wow ok that’s very in depth thanks a lot for the clarification
My favorite one is when he condescendingly asked someone to "give the Pythagorean theorem to the fifth digit
Also, the one where he interviews Ricky Gervais and thinks that he's going to heaven because he's a "good catholic boy", and he doesn't understand why Gervais ain't afraid of death
French grammar & conjugaison is not the easiest one
But i know few people that have learned it and make it super hard to spot they are not French native
Some others (like my spanish mum) could change their accent but didn't and that's fine too
&#x200B;
So i would say not impossible, but hard to get and probably useless, as we do like foreign accents ... at least i do !
I guess it's possible with some work
My mother lived in France for a bit of time now, but she always had an almost undistinguishable accent, and had an even better French than some natives
Very hard
You can usually tell if a person is not a  native french speaker even if they speak very good french and don't make close to grammar mistakes
The accent still betrays
One thing for americans usually is that their "R" sound is SUPER insistant even when they speak french very well
Like "Garçon" becomes "GaRRRçon".  Or the "é" sounds like in the end of "retrouvé" (to find) sounds more like "aay" for native english speakers
You do have a lot of them, but honestly who cares ? As long as people can understand you, keep your accent, it sounds hot :)
There are a few exceptions though
Like Jodie Foster (who went to a french school/high school) speaks pristine french
Like she sounds 100% like a parisian, you really need an extensively long interview with her in french to spot some grammar spots here and there such as misgendering a noun to think "Oh yeah", but it's very slight
I also had a friend from eastern europe who, when I met her, lived in France for like 2 years at most, and she spoke also pristine french
No accent whatsoever, I couldn't believe her when she told me she was not from France
That’s a good thing you try to encourage people who are trying to learn your language
It’s really important
In France when someone is trying to speak French and does the slightest mistake someone will be there to mock him or make him understand that his French is bad
It is really annoying because people don’t want to even try to speak it because of it
It’s already difficult enough to learn it (even French natives make mistakes)
Sorry for my English
Yeah our aeiou are quite guttural
My Spanish mum never managed a clean U It was always a OU
My polish fiancé is also struggling
I keep on saying it's fine but their self expectations generates frustrations
How would you compare french conjugaisons vs English ? And I'm talking about all of them not the casual ones .
How about that any noun must be feminine or masculine
Which is beyond rational for objects
Our 10s of ways to have the same sound ( or é ei ai ...) Noir trying to make French the hardest language in the world but I'm happy to be french learning English rather than the other way around
So you speak like a native french with a cold and nose full
Congratulations
English spelling doesn't make any sense and it's pretty hard to know when use which tense
If think these are the main difficulty of English
That's how I tend to say it with a flue :)
Lol, no
We already have a 35-hour work week and it's a curse
I assure you that French 35-hour work week is NOT working fine
Hum, As a French I d like to thank the German for burrying the war hatchet after more or less 200 years of war
I like how we are kind of best  buddies right now, with Merkel and macron seemingly working hand in hand after years and years of senseless  hatred
Cheers, und ein kebab mit alles  bite :)
I'd like to thank the US for the invention of Blues, Jazz and Rock n' roll, the world would suck without American music
Scotland for being our ally since more than 700 years, and for its army helping (sometimes saving) us mutiple times in our battles against England (isn't it beautiful to be linked by hate for England ? Haha)
The United States for helping us during WWI _and_ WWII, and being an historic ally since the XVIIIth century even though our politic views are often very different
Also, for their amazing music and movies
The UK for being an ally who sacrificed their people in WWI and WWII in France despite the fact that we were ennemies since a millennium
Italy for their awesome food and their breathtaking pieces of art that we love and admire greatly here
Hungary for simply existing because else I couldn't lernen their language
Thank you Spain for allowing us to come in holiday in your country year after year even if we (especially the youth) are terrible tourists
Same here :)   Even if it must be weird to go to your local hospital, pass out there and to wake up in a hospital room with everyone talking german XD
Thanks for the comeback a few years later !
You can also come in the winter ! Our ski resort are cool too :)
Love you too Germany
It took great men and women to put all that history behind us, and people of our generation tend to forget how incredible it is to be able to live in long term peace with our neighbours
I am old enough to have some great-grand-parents to lived through both wars (especially one side who lived in Lorraine)
One day we tried to take one of my great-grand mother to Germany for a day trip, for her it was just impossible as the fear and resentment was just too strong even 60 years later
That day I realised how far we've come nowadays
Wir lieben auch Deutschland ! I think Germany is our biggest ally since quite a long time now :)
Ich liebe Deutschland !
We have a strong bond as countries, and you're our best friend on the international scale
First of all, I agree
We love to shit on each other all the time but in the end we are best friends
Secondly, there is no way to anger a french better than saying Viva la France
Viva is Spanish, in french it's Vive
> But also screw you for not teaching your kids English
We do, everybody is just really self-conscious about their accent
Also, sorry Spain
We welcome you with open arms :)
May I recommend Nice, by the sea, only 45min from ski resorts, best of french and Italian food,  and great  for engineering (not nice itself but around)
That s where I hope to go living after my PhD
And how did you thanked us ?? By partying like madman on the champs elysee after Eder s goal in 2016
My heart is still bleeding
I was in Faro this summer : amazing
Fun fact, France was sometimes called “the second homeland of jazz”, and in Shanghai the French concession was _full_ of jazz clubs
(Which were run by the Green Gang, a mafia who also sold drugs in these clubs, but hey: nobody’s perfect
No need to be super old for that :) My great grandfathers both thought both wars (except one of them was a Hungarian -and an Austro-Hungarian prior), plus one of my grandfathers fought in WW2, and I’m only 20
Some of my friends are in the same situation
Plus, I think we might be more likely to have mixed origins (French and Hungarian for me, plus English and Italian but those are more distant)
And we travel more than ever, which helps some of us realize how awesome the EU is
So, yeah, we know how important and awesome peace is
Boua, most of the wars between us had no good and bad side, and for the last one  the vichy regime  collaborated thoroughly so we are not all white either
But now all is good
And thanks for the beers
Fourcade is so awesome though so it s easy, but now comes the reign of Boe
Yeah, there was a time when Jazz smelled like danger, it was mostly played in brothels for a long time
To be honest, even tough Lafayette is almost considered as a hero (I've learnt recently that you have not one but _several_ cities named Lafayette ?), he is very controversial in France (debates about if he was good or bad)
His actions during the French revolution (with the Champ de Mars massacre and his constant defense of the monarchy) and the Restoration (after Napoleon I) are not well percieved here
He was even sentenced as "Traitor of the Nation" during the Revolution
That's why he always loved and missed the US
But he's also an important figure of French history
What a life he lived ! He met Washington, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette (who hated him), Danton, Napoleon I, Monroe, Franklin ; he participated in the American Revolution, _two_ French Revolutions and the reign of Napoleon
He lived until his 70s, so old at that time
I don't know for the US, but in France his surname is "The hero of two worlds". A complex but very interesting figure !
Well I love going to austra in summer, plenty if 3000m summit for long days of hiking and not so many tourist
So perfect
(Same of Suisse but more expansive)
Italians are very gifted when it comes to music
I didn't know that :o thanks !
You're welcome :D
I'm speaking from experience, my great-grandad was an Italian immigrant from Varese, and he played guitar (I have his old guitar) in local bars in Alsace, he was quite popular
:) I'm a guitar player myself, so I like to think I perpetuate a tradition
As a French person, I'd say that we can vaguely understand most European language, as many words resembles their French equivalent
It's not like we'd understand a full sentence though
Concerning Swiss, Quebec, Belgium etc, they all have at least a part of the country which speaks French, but with some small difference, so yeah I think we understand each other pretty good
I dont know about Romania though, I personally don't understand that language, and I've seen people saying that it's closer to Italian, so I'd say that we don't understand but other people might
>France/French Canada (Québec)/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland
Yes to all
If there is a heavy accent it may require more focus from me but if the other guy does not speak too fast it's totally understandable with a few variations in vocabulary
French can understand without problem Quebecois, Swiss French and Belgian French
The only thing we wouldn't understand is some slang that we do not share, and sometimes a word or two because of the Quebecois accent
But all in all we've got absolutely 0 problem understanding each other
I mostly understand people from Quebec (except very rural parts of it with a strong accent)
I understand French-speaking Swiss people (sorry, not sure about the name
Roman Swiss
), appart from like, five words
our languages are the same, and we get the meaning of these words (those are numbers)
Same with Belgians from the western part of the country, but without the funny words
I don’t understand people from Luxembourg, unless they start speaking French (everybody I spoke to there knew French, so I’m assuming it’s pretty common
Also, history here, we share that language with a fair number of African countries
Sure, I understand other French speakers without any issue
Canadian French is the one that is more tricky, it will not stop us from interacting with each other but a Canadian French speaker may use some words that do not even exist for me sometimes
They also have a really distinctive accent from the rest of the French speaking world
But well, it's still the same language so no real issue
For the other French speaking countries (including African countries) no issue at all, it's mostly an accent thing there
Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg might use different words sometimes (the number 90 is an entirely different word for us and the Belgians) but it's more of a "regionalism".
When it comes to other Latin languages, I learned Spanish but I'm not really good
I understand most things and it's really helped by the fact of being a French speaker
I can understand Italian, Spanish or Romanian when I read it (thus making it easier to buy groceries during holidays)
Those 3 languages are also more pronounced mostly as they are written
If someone is speaking slowly, I might get some of what they are telling me
I'm not sure if the other way around is true though, because French does not follow that rule when it comes to pronounciation
There's almost no difference between belgian, french, and swiss french
A strong canadian accent might be difficult to understand, they have some french words which we don't have or don't use the same way, and they often use a lot of english words when speaking french
Romanian is a different language, we can understand some words like with italian but that's it
Yes, people from french speaking countries understand each other just fine
We speak the same language, you just have to add accents and some funny words in the mix, but those local specific words or expressions aren't really a big deal to understand each other
Sometimes you can even figure it out yourself
Have you tried /r/french, people have patience and are always helpful there
Sounds like you have an incredible streak of bad luck when it comes to teachers
Jó napot kívánok, mate ! No one can understand Hungarian but that's what make it unique
(Great-grandmother was Hungarian, tried to learn it at university but had to drop it because of work
And two hours a week was clearly not enough for such a unique language… Still, I regret that the language has been lost in the family)
Actually, if frenchs and italians spoke a bit slower, i'm sure it would be relatively easy to understand each other
I find quite easy to understand the overall meaning of a basic sentence in Italian even though i never really studied it
Spanish is indeed a bit harder
And about the original question, no problem with Belgian and Swiss French, a very strong Québécois accent may be hard to understand but in general it's okay too
Dude you nailed it, don't be so hard on yourself
Sure people would know you aren't french, but they would totally understand what you mean
Not much unless you go look for it to be honest
France kind of has its head up its own ass when it comes to news but to a lesser extent than the US haha
News about the US involving France or broader geopolitics as well as political tensions
Definitely but that's about it
We'll occasionally hear about whatever "stupid shit Trump said this time" as well but that is mostly to be seen online
Spending a bit of time in both Sweden and the Netherlands actually made me realize why people see France as not being "English-friendly". The difference between the sheer amount of anglo-american media content/entertainment or news you come accross in those countries compared to France is baffling
No wonder we are in the bottom tier of English proficiency in Europe lol
From France : For sure daily for national and international level of US news
Is it bothering ? Yeah kind of ... we hear a lot of any small issue in the US while Lybia, Syria and many other problems on earth are not being talked about as thoroughly
Now US still being the biggest market and trend setter on many social aspects ... it is normal to hear about this country more than some others
Unpopular answer according to what I've read from the thread but here in France, the US do not feature that much in the press
Important news that have an international impact will be covered (such as the presidential election) or news that relate to global events (the Californian wildfires are linked to climate change for exemple) but apart from that, you have to actively look for news on the USA
I'd say not frequently
It depends of something happens in the US, but outside of special events like the current wildfires when there might be more, usually a bit less than one time a week
See, I think everyone misunderstood trump when he said to rake the forests
I think he said we need to *rape* the forests
At least, that would make more sense coming from him
Yeah it okay here, at least on my feed
I checked and out of the top 20, right now I have 11 news about France, 2 US, 2 Turkey, 1 UK, 1 Japan 1 Russia and 2 worldwide
I feel there is some bit of US news, but rarely the front news in France except big events
If I look at le Monde website right now, Californian fires are on 5th position, the 8th and 9th is world covid news
After, the 14th is Joe Biden, 15th Algerian demonstrations, 16th covid effect in Johannesburg
All the rest are French news
Le Figaro is even more French centered, the first international news are Lebanon already far away from the front
You guys have Arte too, and at least in France they report news everyday (and as always they are probably the best we have)
And we lived to see the stupidity of Bush Jr so completely outshone that he appears as someone not that dumb
What a world
I think I speak for all of us when I say the work y'all do as the mod team is recognized and greatly appreciated
Being able to enjoy a wide variety of questions, answers, and conversations without being inundated by agenda-pushing or bad-faith arguments is a huge part of why this sub is such a pleasure to read, and we have you to thank for it
Congratulations, /r/AskEurope
Onwards and upwards
One minute I learn new historical facts and the next everyone's favorite fizzy drinks, this sub is great
Nah
I'm French, that's all
Our culture has a bit in common with our neighbours, but I definitely can't tell I have the same identity as an Icelander or a Cypriot
When I visit any western European country, I always try to imagine if I could live there and possibly feel at home, and the answer is always yes, absolutely
I'm not commenting on Central / Eastern Europe because I've never been there, even though my family has Slovenian roots (50%)
The other half of my family is from Alsace (and a little bit of Italy too)
Alsace being a region which has changed hands from Holy Roman Empire to France, then to Germany and back to France over the centuries, and thus we have kind of a hybrid culture, with French ideals but Germanic lifestyle
I was born and raised in France but I feel strongly European
I've been to the US (many times), Mexico and Japan (only once) and loved those places, but it was probably because they felt foreign and thus interesting
De te magyar vagy
Inkább olyan vagy, mint egy másik magyar, mint egy litván, igaz
Oh hi fellow European
Great username btw
The Eiffel tower is not really overrated, but there is a place where you will definitely get a better view of paris: the tour Montparnasse
It is a very ugly black rectangle tower, and the top of it is the only place from which you won't see it
And you get to see the Eiffel tower too, so definitely a win-win
Also, the Mona Lisa is ridiculously small
If you have to pay to go up in a tower/enjoy a skyview, it's a waste of time
The Champs Elysées
I’m currently Parisian and the less I go there, the better I feel
Clearly Paris !! We often say that Paris is not France, and you will be surprise by the beauty that we have in the country side
I was disappointed by Bratislava
However the blue church was beautiful
We only had time to see Bratislava because we were staying in Vienna but Slovakia's countryside looked amazing from the book I was reading
You have a beautiful coast
My trip to Croatia was one of my best vacation
Plus it's not too crowded
When I try to describe it I tell my friends it's like Corsica, but way better
I think it's because it's easy to get to (fly to the airport, train to the city)
Also, it *is* nice
A group of us spent a long weekend there a few years ago (in January - it was freezing
We had 5 different cuisines for dinner, wandered round the canals
I spent one day at the Rijksmuseum (Rembrandt's Night Watch is one of the most amazing paintings I've seen in person; it's powerful and huge
Edit: also, the houses along the canals are beautiful
I always heard that Rhodes is nice; would you agree or not
I went years ago and can't really remember much about the inside; it's the outside that most people go for I think
The thing with London is that central London is very walkable, but if you get tired there's usually a tube station nearby
Plus, all the free museums
To visit Paris you just have to get lost on the streets and look a bit everywhere
That's the right way to do it
Way better than being in a random queue to a random museum
Or go to the museum off season
well, obviously England
we have that kind of love/hate relationship
i mean we’ve spent centuries fighting each other
that shit builds links
they are our little rosbifs <3
The UK, definitely
We have a love-hate relationship
After reading a few comments, all of them apparently
So as frenchman we have a few but I think you already know them
Germany
and
England
The other countries surrounding us are fine
Those damn English !
(But pretty much every nation in Europe consider us rivals for sole reasons)
It's mutual fear not
I would say that France and Germany have been "ennemies" from 1870 to 1950s, but France's real rival has always been the UK, aka Perfidious Albion
I'm not asking to come off as arrogant, maybe I live under a rock
But in what way do you have rivalry with us
I didn't even know
I didn’t even know we had a rivalry ! why ? i feel like i was betrayed by a friend
I notice that a lot
I see a lot of Italian anger towards the French that isn't really reciprocated
I wish we could get along
I personally have a huge amount of respect for our Italian neighbours as you're one of the few countries who take food as seriously as we do
what the hell ? i feel like everybody hates us but never told us ! first Spain, then Italy
what is it ? WE LOVE YOUR COUNTRIES
YOU’RE OUR LATIN BROTHERS, we should be a gang !
Oh, that explain why when I play with some Italians in videogames they often bring the 2006 topic for no apparent reason, I never also really understood why some of them became a little bit agressive when they realize I am french
Because of coupe du monde ?
Spain, Italy,Germany, Belgium and even Hungary (read that in a comment) are also our rivals but UK will always be the first in our heart
♫  *Three lions on the shirt ...*  ♫
No the english Love France, to the point where thet faught 2 wars that lasted a hundred years for it, but they hate the french, as every european worth of it's name do (yes even the french)
I remember our Spanish teacher told us that Spain hated us because we beheaded our king, because of Napoleon (obviously), and because of « fútbol »
sir, the land is called northern France
"france itself doesn't think it has rivalries". That's completly false man, the rivalries with England and Germany are well-known here since they were the most important
We did nothing wrong !
I mean we had napoleon so that didn't help
But we like you
Flag almost the same = good food people
Me neither mate
Me too have never heard of a Franco-spanish rivalry
Maybe it just goes one way ?
Nah, they're ours ! Hands off !
&#x200B;
It gets too dark with you guys, that's why we have to be all respectful of each other, instead of mercilessly roasting each other like we do with the Brits, which is way more fun
well it’s not really accurate anymore for Germany
we just do the funny accent and insult them behind their back when they’re being loud in public places but that’s all
> Germany historically
Germany was a rival for barely 75 years
>fear not
That's not it at all
it's the same as saying "Don't worry"/"Be assured", but old-fashioned
It’s generally because it’s linked to bad stuff we did to them in the past
It’s not so much rivalry as old grudges against us
Spain for Napoleon invading them despite them being allies at the time and taking the royal family heirs to France as hostages which is definitely a shitty thing to do to anyone
From what I understood it may have indirectly led to the Franco period
Italy probably because of Napoleon too although some of them are grateful for him ridding them of the Austrians who were oppressing them and relieving them of their riches before we did
That and I suppose a rivalry over who has the best food and maybe some football thrown in too
Honestly, as of today, the only ones we keep the rivalry hot and steamy with are the Brits
Everyone else is a lover
Except for our Rosbif neighbors !
(love you guys, though really do !)
We're better at forgiving
But the most two sided rivalry is definitely with Belgium
You're welcome for wine and apéritif any time
not mad just disappointed :( but yeah totally ! we should be the stay-more-than-six-hours-around-the-table-while-discussing-very-loud-with-our-relatives gang
The only TV shows we know from Belgium are stuff that exist in France but in a hardcore dumber way like "l'amour est dans le pré en Belgique". And it's like they take the worst people to prove that the belgian are dumber
It is unfair but i think it's a french thing and it's shame because France has discovered a few belgian celebrities that we love
French TV groups must refuse to get belgian stuff in France because I think they want to keep their programs
Canal + has put their channel in clear for free for the quarantine, and the other TV groups sued them for unloyal competition
So yeah maybe I think I know why we never see things from you but we like you
>we hate the French
That's the part we have in common
Had heard that too, that the English archers who were taken alive had two fingers cut off to make sure they could never draw a bow again because the massive use English long bows was such a problem for the French and that English archers would show their fingers to French troops to taunt them as a result
Since we all have heard the same thing I suggest we all treat that as a fact, regardless of whether it’s true or not
we just do the funny accent to be fair
Not Germany in itself but the place were Germany is, we have been rivals since Charlemagne died basically
meh not soo much in comparason to us
yeah he was kind of an asshole (he did the best and the worst, such a controversial man), sorry :)
good idea
Nah, not for us
Yup
That's straightforward
Good on him/her
>But the most two sided rivalry is definitely with Belgium
Je te demande pardon ?
During the times of Henry the Fowler and Otto the Great sure, but otherwise Germany has been virtually nonexistent until 1866
Yeah, that's one-sided too
The only rivalry we really care about is the one with England
Maybe Germany, too, but that one is not comfortable to think about
Californian What ?
I'm sorry, I understand the word but it doesnt mean anything to me next to the word "Californian". :)
We know that Macron is creating resentment abroad, we know because he creates tons of resentment in France too
Our government’s official stance is still to tell people that masks are useless unless you are actually sick, as if we didn’t have news from abroad and pictures of people in South Korea where literally everyone wears masks
The amount of stupid shit this government pulls is just tiring
The various mask piracy acts are completely stupid too no matter the country
We get our masks stolen by the US so we steal masks from others it’s literally endless
All that because they, along with the former governments, destroyed tons of those strategic reserves to cut costs over the years
yes we do ! usually there are the grandparents, uncle/aunts and the cousins
But of course you have to get along with them
and usually we spend almost all day eating
that because of « apéritif », then appetizer, the main dish, cheese, salad, dessert, and then coffee
Hey, I learned that recently but apparently to have potatoes cut in rectangular form then fried in oil is something from Paris, I'll try to find the link and put it in a edit
Edit: It took me far too long to find the link back
But here it is:
We're not very fond of ourselves either tbf
Macron wasn't that popular at the beginning of his presidency
The main reason he won is that he was against Le Pen (far right), he won even though we didn't had abstention like this since 1969
Yeah, they all did and now they are all « looks like we don’t have enough beds for everyone guys, not our fault though, it’s all because of the five guys who played a game of football last week end despite the lockdown
Ah u/L0kumi, je me rappelle bien t'avoir fourni cette information
Je suis fier de toi, propage la vérité sur cette terre :')
Is that why you left
There's usually a drain in the upper part of bathtubs and sinks so they don't overflow if the main drain at the bottom is clogged and water keep pouring
Is "wieners in the oven" a euphemism
Family of mine in Hungary felt it
~~News talks about one person dead and some damage
Info was corrected
I strongly agree with you on the party/beach thing
Well Disney as well, I just don't really like animated movies so I'm not familiar with most of the characters, I would only go to the Marvel part now that they have that
All the tropical beaches as well because I don't like when it's over 25°C.
I hate Paris as well
I have no interest in Japan, sure it might be pretty but I don't get it
If I ever went to the US, it would be Washington DC or Seattle then go to Canada, New York seems so busy and LA seems really hot and fake
Disneyland Paris
I don't see the point of coming from America and going to Disneyland when you have Paris right there
That's a very good point, how you you holiday in the US without having to drive everywhere
It sounds exhausting
It's much better to use public transportation than to have to pay for gas, tolls depending on where you are and parking
Preservative in english is conservateur in french
Préservatif in french is condom in english
A rape in english is un viol in french
Une râpe (à fromage) in french is a cheese grater in english
Komisch in German means weird while comique in French means funny
Part in Hungarian means shore while porte (trust me they almost sound the same) means door
Chat in English means what it means while chat is French is cat and chatte is pussy
And the well-known tak that means branch in Dutch, roof in Norwegian, thanks in Danish, like that in Czech, but in Latvian, yes in Polish and no in Indonesian
Besar in Spanish means "to kiss"
Baiser in French means "to fuck".
Very easy words to mix up in context, too
In French *douche* is shower, in English douche is an insult
(Mostly) in Norman French, *fagoter* is a verb meaning having clothes on, while fag°t is an insult as well in English
In French *bite* means d!ck, while in English this time it is not a cursed word
~~In some slangs *bezo* means a kid, but in Spanish it means to f#ck
Words that sound similar :
En Pay (to give money) / Fr Paie (Salary) / Fr Paix (peace)
&#x200B;
As for purely written words : En/Fr : Fr/EN
Actually/Actuellement : En fait/Currently
Administration/Administration : Gouvernment/Public sevice
Novel/Nouvelle : Un roman/a short story
Petrol(or Gas)/pétrole : Essence/Petroleum (crude oil)

Will update when i'll have less work
French "librairie" (bookshop) and English "library"
How could you forget "bite"?
Pain means bread
Another :
demand > exigence
il demande > he asks
For french and spanish :
Gato in spanish is chat in french (cat)
Gâteau in french (pronounced exactly like gato) is pastel in spanish (cake)
Pastel in french is some kind of pen, I don't know the spanish and english word for it (maybe pastel too ?)
Actually we also use "Entendre" for "Comprendre", for example the translation of "J'entends bien" is "I hear well" BUT also "I understand" :)
Baiser also mean "to kiss"
'Je lui ai baisé la main' (I kissed his hand)
Its not used very often thought
J'ai mis ceux où j'ai vraiment expérimenté un quiproquo
Mais oui t'as raison, for non french speakers : bite in english is mordre (verb) or morsure (noun) in french, bite in french is dick in english
You are correct, it is the same word in English and French:
, although most people would call them crayons in everyday speak
There's also "bitte", "please" in german
I'm talking about [those things]
According to the link, I think it's called pastel too in english
I should clarify that the second meaning is for a formal langage, It's not something you learn when you start French !
This is probably why you only know the "strict" translation
In french it's both the object and the color it produces (couleur pastel)
I love living here
But I would like to live somewhere else for some time, like in Germany or in the UK, because I love these two countries's culture
(I already went on holiday there and enjoyed it a lot)
I do love my country and living in it, but I also want to move somewhere else
Maybe not for the rest of my life, but I certainly do not want to spent all of my life in France
The first reason for me to move would be my future job
I'm in film school to become an editor, and I do not want to work in the French audiovisual industry
If I can I'd like to work in the UK and in Canada/the USA maybe
Otherwise if it's not for work there's plenty of country I'd like to discover/live in
Germany seems really nice per exemple
I like my country, but people are assholes, and our policies are so annoying, you may have to wait 4 month to have your proof of incorporation, as an example
maybe Poland or austria could be great, but i don't really know
Sure I like living in France, but I went 2 times with my best friend to Quebec and damn we absolutely loved it
I'll see after my studies what will I do
I'd also like to visit Sweden once because everything seems wonderful about it (thank you Football Manager for starting this)
Fuck yes
I enjoyed various countries as a tourist but I always feel like France is where I belong
The food culture is just so perfect in France and I would be unhappy with a limited cheese selection at the supermarket
I'm fine with living here, mostly for the work legislation, working 35h a week for the same pay as another country where they do 40h is pretty cool
Is there a lot of opportunities for work
I live in the East
It's very quiet there, and there are probably more fields than people, as they aren't a lot of big cities
Depending on where you are in France (even when just talking about the metropolitan area), it does differ a lot indeed
The South is very nice, if you wanted to move briefly I'd say go there
Crafty
You're more dangerous than I thought
We should smear some marmite on us to lure you, that should do the trick
Try Nantes or Brittany maybe, you'll get the sea without the accent
We couldn't let the golden opportunity slide
With the crisis, we do not have enough baguettes to stab all these gentlemen, as awful as it may sound
Pretty much perfect
We have access to both the Atlantic ocean and the Mediterranean sea, we have 4 different mountain range, the Alps, the Pyrénées, the Jura and the Massif Central
We have a huge diversity of environments, sceneries and culture, from the southern Europe typical ones, to the most common northern ones
We have great neighbors, allowing us to borrow (quite) a bit of their culture, mainly gastronomical
Therefore, we have heavily marked hispanic regions in the south, German influenced Alsace, and some cultural influence from both Switzerland and Italy in the Alps
Of course, we have Corsica, which is a whole culture on its own, but our relationship has always been quite complicated to say the least
I think one could spend his lifetime in France without ever getting tired of the diversity of cultures, scenery, great holidays spots, etc
I do love my land
We have the Atlantic Ocean, the Channel, the Mediterranean sea and mountains, which makes great natural defence and nice vacation spots
We also have lots of neighbouring countries, which is cool during peace time
I'd say our only weakness is the Belgian border
During most of history we had tons of land borders with rival countries and a fuckton of sea border which is a problem with the british (one of our enemies) being such a naval powerhouse for most of its history
Them being an island (so no land border with anyone) it meant they could focus on navy for their defense -something we couldn't do- and rope in various european countries to fight us on land at the same time (looking at Prussia and Austro-Hungarian Empire for example)
That was not an easy position to say the least
Now that we are all at peace I would say it's an alright position, we can easily trade with the US when they are not busy being pricks as well as with Africa, we are next to Germany which is one of our main political partners as well as next to Italy meaning the two countries with awesome food are right next to each other
Our politicians and CEOs also enjoy being right next to Switzerland and Luxembourg to go hide money from the tax administration
Belgium ensures that we are continuously supplied with excellent beer and double bath beef fat cooked fries
France
Great in time of peace, very central position, direct access to other important countries, ocean and sea connected
Terrible in time of war, very central position, other important countries have direct access, either by ocean, sea or through belgium
For real, extremely varied landscape from Normandy to la cote d azure
2 seas, 1 ocean, 4 mountains Jura Pyreenee Alps and Massif central
Good skiing spots, good surfing spots (Biarritz is top notch)
Good soil for beer, good soil for wine
No extreme event (volcano, earthquake)
The down side would be that half of France is too north for the wearher to be perfect
I d say for a small country you really have everything
Germany is a beautiful country, but the sea in the north is way too cold
This
Yeah, we good
Just wish we were a bit closer to the Nordic countries, but that's a personal, subjective opinon as I'm just totally in love with them
So basically, we bought it in 1768 IIRC, from the Kingdom of Genova
Fun fact, this was one year prior to Napoleon’s birth
Had it been a few time later, mf would have been Italian
Back then, they already had strong independent views, as shown by historical figures such as Pascal Paoli (who Napoleon tried to impress during his youth, only to understand they would never have him, a small noble from Ajaccio, at any high place)
To this day, this quest for independence is still going strong, with a heavy pressure on the island by mafiosi & nationalist terrorist groups
For example, there’s not a single McDonald in Corsica, all previous attempts to build one have been bombed at some point
Shit is so tight, my uncle’s neighbors in the south of Corsica had a red house that was visible from the coast
Since Corsicans considered it was ruining the view, they blew the living room up in the winter (so that there was no victim of course)
French language used as an official language is often seen with a bad eye there: i.g. The roadsigns are displayed both in Corsican (it ressembles an italian dialect) and in French, and the French roadsigns are often covered in bullet holes, so there’s that
Corsicans are a very proud people, maybe too much but they sure do love their island and hate anyone from the continent
They have to tolerate them of course, as tourism is probably the single biggest source of income for the island: I went to Corsica quite often in the winter about 10 years ago, in a magnificent town called Bonifacio, the place was empty in the winter, almost a ghost town
I just want to state that I ain’t no political expert nor am I an historian, so there’s a lot of details missing in here, but it’s just coming from my experience as a regular vacationer there
And now they speak French and have been quite integrated for some time
I am French, that’s part of my identity
I ve been there for tourism and it a really lovely, but it always make me remember the time when we go see  my family  in Normandy during winter,  like it a really nice but I feel like I cannot enjoy the water as I should,
But maybe I just did nt have the good weather
Those Fjørds though
People with guns in France are either criminals who buy them at the black market or hunters in which case they have a license
Hunting guns mainly, but some mafiosi do have a stock of explosives and assault rifles, although they rarely use them
Shoot-outs usually happen between mafiosis as vendetta
My father used to know a dude that got shot on his yacht in the port of Porto-Vecchio
There’s this joke about the prices
"A Parisian walks into a sandwich place in Bonifacio and asks what sandwiches are available
The owner answers:
-There’s the Corsican sandwich, corsican bread with corsican ham, corsican salad, corsican cheese and corsican butter
-Oh right, anything else
-There’s the tourist sandwich, corsican bread with corsican ham, corsican salad, corsican cheese and corsican butter
-Oh, huh
kinda similar what’s the difference
-The Corsican sandwich is 3€, the tourist sandwich is 12€
-Huh
I’ll take a corsican sandwich then
-We’re out of stock
The Plantagenet weren't Occitans
They were Angevins (from Anjou, France hence the name "Angevin Empire")
I am actually surprised by how confused so many English seem to be about their history in the middle ages haha
I suppose your reference to "Occitan" is because you heard somewhere that it is a language Richard the Lionheart probably spoke, right
Well yes, his mother was Eleanor of Aquitaine after all
Richard and his brothers spoke both old French (as their father Henry II did) and Occitan as their mother did (occitan was the language spoken in Aquitaine)
The Duchy of Aquitaine became the core of the french lands that formed the Angevin Empire as Henry came to rule it when he married Eleanor
But the duchy and the other french domains of the empire, though under the direct and independent rule of the Plantagenet kings of England, were still nominally part of the Kingdom of France as the Plantagenet ruled them as dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy, counts of Anjou etc (so vassals of the french kings basically), not as "kings of England" (a king has zero obligation to play vassalage to another one)
I don't quite understand this weird denomination in England of what is "french" and what isn't in the middle ages
The kingdom of France was a feudal state, so it wasn't centralized
All regions of the kingdom had essential things in common (dialects of the langue d'oïl in the northern half of the kingdom with old french and norman french for example being two of them and dialects of the langue d'oc in the southern half with occitan being one, then you have religion, principles of knighthood and chivalry etc) but they had social customs unique to them as well
That is to be expected in a feudal state
Poitevins weren't Flemings, Angevins weren't Normans, Aquitanians weren't Bretons, Picards weren't Parisians
So what exactly is french and what isn't in say 1066 or 1170
If people from Aquitaine, Normandy, Anjou, Provence and other regions that were ruled by feudal lords/vassals cannot be considered "French" because they weren't under the direct authority of the french king, you"re in for a shock mate haha
Until the reign of Philip Augustus (the french king who is credited with beginning the centralization of France and who infamously conquered most of the english continental holdings from King John Lackland, destroying the Angevin Empire in the process), Parisians and their immediate neighbours would be the only people that can be considered French as Paris and its surroundings were the only places the Kings of France actually ruled lmao
So yeah by that logic, only a tiny tiny minority of the people who lived in the Kingdom of France were "French". It makes zero sense
Sure, nationality was a concept which appeared centuries later but come on
They were all as French as they could have been under the shitshow that was feudalism
Nobody is going to argue that Saxons, Bavarians, Hessians etc in the HRE weren't germans
because you know "Germany", the unified state, wasn't yet a thing lol
Is your name a reference to Peter Fehervari, the warhammer 40k author
I was quite sure that it is not written that way, but I like the Scandinavian touch :P
You can argue they were an independent duchy as were most of the lands forming the kingdom of France therefore they were "Normans" as "French" as a national identity didn't exist yet
I definitely agree
That's not the matter at hand
French culture, language and ethnicity did exist or at least for the two former the many variants of it
The matter at hand is how the hell can anyone consider the Normans (those of the Duchy of Normandy, right
) in 1066 to not be French which in itself isn't the issue
but go around describing them as Scandinavians, when they were ethnically and culturally more of the former
The Normans (Viking raiders) who settled Normandy (named after them) in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte were purely and simply Scandinavians yes, there was nothing french about them, absolutely nothing
But you're aware there were people already living in those lands they settled in northern France, right
That population didn't magically disappear when Rollo and his men settled it
There is a reason the Norsemen were the ones assimilated and not the opposite
Scandinavians have never been a majority in Normandy, even if it was named after the norse settlers
The House of Normandy itself, while of nordic heritage (Rollo being the first ruler and patriarch of the house), cannot be considered a scandinavian family in 1066 either
Rollo's son William Longsword (second ruler of Normandy) was half french ethnically as his mother was Poppa of Bayeux (matriarch of the house)
William Longsword himself then married Luitgarde of Vermandois who gave birth to the third ruler Richard I of Normandy
By that point, how can they even be described as "french-speaking Norsemen" or "Norsemen who adopted french culture"? By 1066, even the ruling dynasty itself was predominantly french by blood
Keep in mind William was the 7th ruler of Normandy
7 generations
Do you know that joke about some dude from Boston, Massachussets claiming to be Irish because he descends from some Irish dude who settled the US generations ago and married a local woman
His ancestors haven't exactly been Irish after that but hey he is lmao
Here I quote an excerpt of Cambridge Medieval History, edited by J.R. Tanner, C.W. Previte-Orton, Z.N. Brook
(Volume 5, Chapter XV
It reads:
> “To understand the Normandy of 1066 it is not necessary to go back to the foundation of the duchy in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, or to attempt to dispel the fog that surrounds the careers of the first three dukes
These princes, Rollo (911-931), his son William Longsword (931-942), and his grandson Richard I surnamed The Fearless (942-996), were all undoubtedly men of mark; but nevertheless for this period there are really very few reliable details available
Dudo, dean of Saint Quentin, who wrote about 1020, indeed professes to tell their story, but his work is fundamentally untrustworthy and for the most part based on legend and hearsay
Some important points, however, can be established about the development of the duchy during the tenth century
The first is that by the end of the reign of Richard I (996) the descendants of the original Norse settlers had become not only Christians but in all essentials Frenchmen
They had adopted the French language, French legal ideas, and French social customs, and had practically merged with the Frankish or Gallic population among whom they lived
I am interested in your sources though to have a broader perspective
That is weird to say though
That french nobles who very obviously came from France, weren't Anglo-Saxons and didn't even speak english as a mother tongue or most not even at all until Edward IV (was it
) were more culturally english than french
In England, in the middle ages, there was a very clear cultural schism between the lower class and the royalty/nobility
The english nobles held holdings both in France and England and spent time in both
In fact until the Plantagenet were cut off from the continent in 1214 with the destruction of the Angevin Empire, many of them spent much of their time in their french holdings, with some (Richard comes to mind) most of it
I don't think there were that much cultural differences between french nobles and english ones at all
Both the french and english nobility were that interlinked
It can be argued that it is the merging of the norman and french culture the medieval english nobility with that of the anglo-saxon lower class that evolved into english culture and the english language as we know it
And sorry but no
haha like I said, all regions of France were independent in the middle ages, so yes they all had a culture and social customs unique to them
That is totally understandable in a non-centralized feudal state
But it is absolutely ridiculous to claim the Normans (nobility and peasantry alike) were ethnically or culturally closer to Danes or Norwegians than they were to let's say Parisians
By 1066, that was no longer the case at all and that is supported by english historians themselves
The region called Normandy (after the Norsemen settled it in 911 by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte) was already populated by a gallo-roman/west frankish population
The local population was not relocated after the norse settlement
The Scandinavians were a minority among the larger french population as Rollo and his men settled it after a failed viking raid (the Siege of Chartres in 911), it was not a some mass immigration from Scandinavia
The House of Normandy, while of nordic heritage (Rollo being the first ruler and patriarch of the house of course), cannot be considered a scandinavian family in 1066 either
Rollo's son William Longsword (second ruler of Normandy) was half french ethnically as his mother was Poppa of Bayeux (matriarch of the house)
William Longsword himself then married Luitgarde of Vermandois who gave birth to the third ruler Richard I of Normandy
By that point, how can they even be described as "french-speaking Norsemen" or "Norsemen who adopted french culture"? William the Bastard was the 7th ruler of Normandy
By 1066, even the ruling dynasty itself was predominantly french not just culturally, but by blood as well
This is written even in english history books
Here I quote an excerpt of Cambridge Medieval History, edited by J.R. Tanner, C.W. Previte-Orton, Z.N. Brook
(Volume 5, Chapter XV
It reads:
> “To understand the Normandy of 1066 it is not necessary to go back to the foundation of the duchy in 911 by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, or to attempt to dispel the fog that surrounds the careers of the first three dukes

They had adopted the French language, French legal ideas, and French social customs, and had practically merged with the Frankish or Gallic population among whom they lived
So the whole Normans in 1066 being considered more Scandinavians than French thing is a bit ridiculous
Yeah I suppose he must have Hungarian roots
I know he lives in London but no idea if he is originally from there
Well
the Norsemen who settled Normandy in 911 not being ethnically the same as the "Normans" living in Normandy in 1066 is the point I've been trying to make since the beginning
I for one have a hard time understanding how the Duchy of Normandy was populated by people who were ethnically Scandinavians in 1066 when Scandinavians never were a majority in Normandy when they settled it in 911 to begin with
Many (the ruling family and nobility especially) had Scandinavian ancestors
William the Bastard is a descendent of Rollo
I understand Rollo being considered ethnically Scandinavian
I mean he 100% was
But I have a hard time understanding how William can be considered that if his ancestors after Rollo haven't exactly been Scandivians
A bit of Scanxinavian in him sure but that's about it
Does the concept of ethnicty works differently in Japan
lol
I don't know man
if my dad is ethnically French and my mom ethnically Japanese
I am ethnically half-French and half-Japanese
And if I marry and have a family with a Japanese woman myself, then my children are 3/4 Japanese and only 1/4 French, so mostly Japanese ethnically speaking, no
That's how it works where I am from
Nationality is something recent yes and cannot be applied to the past but ethnicity is not
Blood has always been blood
The Normans weren't "French"... not French like I am
That didn't exist in 1066
Nobody is questioning that
I left France 2 years ago for my studies because I wanted to live somewhere else as I was tired of France (education, administration, work
) and wanted to take a degree in English
Now I've got a nice boyfriend here in Denmark (+ being gay here is way easier here than in France) and I started a job in field around a month ago
Plus each time I went back to France to visit my friends and family, I was super happy to leave again after 2 weeks, and I'm just negatively fascinated every single time I hear something about French politics
So not planning at all to move back
I left France in 2005 for a world tour
Instead of spending a few days or weeks in a country, I stay for a few years
Middle-East, Asia, Africa, North America
I’m sitting out the sanitary crisis in rural US at the moment and hope to move out in a couple of years when it’s over
South America looks interesting to me
I might just go if Americans decide to elect Trump again in November
I became a third culture kid because of my dad's job
He works for a  multinational, so I was raised in the US, the UK and Belgium, and educated in international schools
I've now settled in Brussels and work full-time in English despite being French
Well, I don't know which one is the best for the programme you're looking for, but I studied in Aarhus and it was quite nice (in humanities)
Concerning living expenses, I wouldn't recommend Copenhagen as rents are insanely high (like 600€/month for a room), so other main university cities (Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense) are better on this point, but concerning night/student life, Copenhagen and Aarhus are the best
In general, living in Denmark is more expensive than almost every European country, especially for you coming from Lithuania, but if you find a student job (easier to find in Aarhus and Copenhagen if you don't speak Danish) and work 10-12 hours a week, you can get a scholarship of around 600€/month in addition to your salary, so it's quite easy to get around 1100€/month, which is way enough to live comfortably

Too much poetry in one day, have a good evening
Yes Arnold Dan's Les starting blocks
Arnold (from the 80s show) in the starting blocks
I knew it as “mandarle un fax al diablo”
It's actually refering to coil pottery
A "colombin" is a long sausage of clay, and clay is usually brown in colour
As an image is worth a thousand words ...
Yes sure
But I don't see really the analogy of this
"Avoir la taupe au guichet" (to have the mole at the check-in counter)
"Avoir le cigare au bout des lèvres" (to have the cigar at the edge of the lips)
"Passer par le Chappa'ai" (going through the Chappa'ai - Stargate reference)
There's probably more out there
>"Mouler un cake", Mold a cake
Weird, I always heard "démouler un cake", un-mold (?) a cake
"sa race" or "sa mère" can be added to any sentence
And that's the beauty of these two expression
It was popular in the 80s, not so much now, Lada France actually died a few years ago
I only know of it because a friend of mine is obssesed with his goddamn Lada
Lada is also the name of the greenhouse unit on the International Space Station used to grow plants [
That was my first car
When I worked at a touristic site in Paris and Americans always tried to pay me so they could cut the queue and I was like "that's corruption of a state employee sir, also I earn enough doing my job thank you"
Oh man we really like to criticize food and that's the same if we're invited but it's not meant at an insult, just our sincere opinion
Edit: of course there are limits and the guy is wrong to have said that, just saying in general
An outdoor BBQ is done the same way as a picnic so yeah, you have to bring your own food
If the host invit you in his house, he provide the food, just like for an usual dinner
You just have to bring a bottle of wine/beers or some snacks to be polite
I think in this case it feels weird to be in socks with complete strangers, removing shoes is for friends, when you’re comfortable
So maybe you keep your shoes on a bit for introductions and then remove them if it’s more the style of the house
Or you know, context, if everyone has shoes on, you keep them, or the other way
You don't say that to your hosts though
Especially your MIL
> I've had many instances where I show up and am fed some charcuterie, wine, bread, nuts and the night kind of ends
Because you weren't invited to diner but to *apéritif*.
The BBQ is known to be something informal where everybody pinches in
But if someone invites you to *dinner*, you'll look odd bringing food
People are expected to bring wine at most
I mean if I invite someone to come over for dinner, dinner is expected
If I offer a friend to come over for a beer at 19:00, I obviously have eaten either so we'll figure out what to do later
I don't know, it just makes sense
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Probably easier to sleep early when it's always dark outside and the sun is gone after 6pm
Suck it
Beautifully described
Spain is also on the wrong time zone
The sun rises about 1
3 hours later than if your timezone was correct
When I went to England, by the time we went to the night club (01:00) every English people was trashed and going home
It was weird
( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)
Maybe a little like that
If it’s too meet casually without really any solid activities, it’s alright, but for specific activities, or if someone has something to do later, you just lose time with the people you meet
Or the whole country works the same way
The Tales of Charles Perrault were pretty dark
Disney softened much of the original tales
Mmh
Peau d'Anne ( ***Donkeyskin***  ) from Perrault is pretty weird : A king had a beautiful wife and a rich castle, including a marvelous  donkey whose droppings were gold
One day his wife died, after making  him promise not to marry except to a woman whose beauty and attributes  equaled hers
It became clear that the only woman who would fit the  promise was his own daughter
So yeah, incest
&#x200B;
Except that, well,
* The beauty and the beast which is basically a stockolm syndrom novel
* Barbe Bleue novel (Blue beard) from Perault is quite brutal, considering the main character killed all his wifes
* Le petit poucet ( **Hop-o'-My-Thumb** ) from Perault, where the children are abandoned by their parents and Poucet have to save his brothers and sisters from an Ogre
* I also read the original version of "the 3 littles pigs"  when I was a child . The wolf resolves to come down the chimney, whereupon the pig who owns the brick house lights a pot of water on the fireplace
The wolf falls in and is boiled to death
Then, the pigs eat him
In France, our child stories were not that disturbing, but our nursery rythmes on another hand
I mean, we truly learned them at school, and yet, most of us don't know the meaning of the lyrics
* [Il était un petit navire] (there was a little ship) is about canibalism ([translation]
&#x200B;
* [Ne pleure pas jeannette] (Don't cry Jeannette)
In a nutshell, [The lyrics] are:
* *Don't cry Jeanette, We will marry you off
To the son of a prince, Or the son of a baron
* *I don't want any prince,  Even less a baron
I want my beloved Peter,  The one who's in prison*
* *You won't have your Peter,  We'll hang him*
* *If you hang Peter,  Hang me with him,*
* *And they hanged Peter,  And his Janet with him .*
&#x200B;
* [Une sourie verte] (a green mouse) is a song about the torture of the vendéens (who wore green uniforms back this time) during the french revolution:
* *"  A green mouse, That ran in the grass, I caught it by its tail, I showed it to those men
The men said: Dip it in oil, Dip it in water
It will become a snail
Nice and warm
&#x200B;
* [A la pêche aux moules] (Fishing for mussels)  is about the [rape of a child
] Yep
&#x200B;
* [Alouette, gentille alouette] is about killing/cooking alive an skylark (bird)
&#x200B;
* [Il court, il court le furet] is a spoonerism
If you switch the letters C and F, "*Il court, il court le furet"* (he run, he run, the ferret) become "*Il fourt, il fourt, le curé*" (He shag, he shag, the priest)
* You will understand the rest with the video haha *"He run, he run, the ferret, the ferret from the wood, myladies
*" ;)
&#x200B;
* [Au claire de la lune] is about prostitution
&#x200B;
* [Jean petit qui danse] (Jean petit is dancing) is about a french dissident, Jean Petit, who died in  1643  from the  [Breaking wheel] torture
The way this torture method works is by breaking the bones of the convicted person, one by one, so here they start by breaking his fingers, than his hand, his foot, his leg etc
So the lyrics "*Jean petit is dancing with his leg, with his hand, with his foot etc*" sounds more
disturbing
&#x200B;
* [Sur le pont du nord] (the North Bridge) where a young girl wants to go to a ball on the North Bridge, but her mother refuses
She will go there in secret with her brother
The bridge collapsed and they both died
Bad luck
&#x200B;
* [La Rirette] is about the gangbang/rape (?) of a young woman and 4 "young and handsome men".
&#x200B;
* [Le petit cordonier] (the little shoemaker) is about an alcoholic shoemaker who beats his wife " [He'd beat her so right
Exactly as needed
&#x200B;
* [Il était une bergère] It is the story of a shepherdess who made a cheese
Her cat ate the cheese, so she killed it
Later, feeling remorse, she went to confess to the village priest
The priest says "*My Child, for penance, we will "kiss" each other"*. Later, she said she liked it so much, she will kill another cat
&#x200B;
* [A la claire fontaine] is basically a woman who lost her boyfriend because she refused to have sex with him
Merkel because on our century,hitting a woman is socially innaceptable
So win by forfeit
With my (now ex) American boyfriend, we had a heated argument about what was a "filet mignon". For a French, it's pork, for an American, it's some sort of beef steak ? Anyway I won by asking in which language that name was
Well, yes, "misérable" can mean despicable or pathetic
I had the reverse experience living in Australia
I remember talking to a guy in a resort town who had made a « short 6 hours drive » to spend the weekend there
I definitely understand what you mean
Italian dad, Canadian mum, born in Cambridge, lives in France most of my life
I feel french but I have italian documentation
I’ve been losing my Italian accent and it breaks my heart
I getchu bro
Could you recommand some good Greek youtube channels with English subtitles please ? I'm learning Greek and I want to listen more to the language :)
Hungarian culture is so cool
I will do it !
Architecture, language, cuisine
I'm too lazy to develop but yeah that's it
[LAUGHS IN FRENCH MEAL]
It's really unbelievable how many wine bottles we can drink at a meal
For instance when my parents invite friends or family members, for a lunch, if we are around 6 people in total, we can drink up to 4-5 or 6 bottles sometimes
EDIT : Damn, talking about my country's alcohol problem gave me my first Award, thank you
In France you can absolutely trash yourself but still be seen as a fine alcool connoisseur
South west of France and a part of Spain has [Feria]
Once upon a time it was nice festival with some fanfare, bullfighting, religious celebration ...
Now it's a great occasion to get wasted with thousands of other peoples drinking cheap bear/vine/sangria/whatever
Bayone in the extreme case, the whole town become a giant bar
The fuck are they thinking about ? Drinking but not getting drunk ? Are they drinking water or what ? Of course drinking is for getting drunk, otherwise we wouldn't say "drunk".
Of course, not absolutely shitfaced every time, and not getting drunk is fine too, but the people who want to drink but consider being drunk as immature and irresponsible don't seem to understand how it works
Bad but young people like it because its so cooool to be drunk
And in UK whether Scotland or England you have the Fireball that have been a real pain in the ass for the country
And going to the bar is also normalized
And as a beer geek, when I go to taste a new release with friends, I know it IS a "traquenard" (we can translate by trap) and I'll wake up at 9AM with a can in my hand at a friend's apartment
Other detail : next Monday I'll work and study in Paris
Goodbye, liver
So yeah being drunk is the standard weekend in France
Snaps
You mean Schnaps
It's what we call eau-de-vie in French (even if Schnaps is also used in Alsace and Lorraine for the kirsch, the quetsche and the mirabelle) or brandy in English
You've never really been in France or Germany if you've never saw us wasted man
Just the sheer amount of alcohol we can consume during a single family diner (*extremely* important in our culture
Starts at 11-12h and finish at 16h with the full menu of entrée-plat-fromage-dessert-café, and of course, a lot of wine and other booze)
Getting hammered once a week is the staple for students here
Student's party generally take place every Thursday
Fun fact, we're also one of the 3 country in Europe with the biggest alcoholism problem
So all in all, I wouldn't say we're just a "social only drinking" country
Yeah that's what I also think (even though, wine is around 12%, it goes fast)
But not foreign friends who told me that they never knew a country that is used to drink more on a regular basis than France
Edit : the record at a meal for 7 people was 3 bottles of champagne, 2 of red Bordeaux, 2 of red Bourgogne and 3 bottles Muscadet if I remember well
But it was not at my parents' place, we were invited by friends of them
"drinking wine is more upper class and thus you cannot be alcoholic
Dude you really don't know the Villageoise, a.k.a. the wine of the homeless drunkards
Maybe private parties aren't the same as back home
What is an AF event
Also, you just could've find french people that do not like to drink, they exists as in any other country x)
The polite thing might be it, they're new in a different country than theirs, they must not want to look like total trash in front of you, or they don't know how you drink in NZ
Yup, I'm not really aware of the prices and the alcohol market in Finland
France is really one of the only countries with wine bottles sold for 2 or 3 euros
Well, the AF things aren't moments to drink to death, everyone's here to share something, to discover, to talk
Not really to get shit faced
Especially during a tasting, never get drunk during a testing
You wouldn't taste anything at all in the end
You drink cheap beers*
I'm the kind of asshole that pays a 44cL can of beer 9€ because it's a Double New England IPA
But for things like whisky, you can have some good shit for a really cheap price
(My go-to for a party is the Glen Turner Heritage Double Cask, it's around 18-20€ for a bottle and it's actually nice)
I officially invite you to one of my family diner next time you come to France
I also invite you to a student party
It'd be a shame not to try them
Bidets
They've been very rare for decades now
Even 30 years ago, they were already uncommon
A few bigots pretended that bidets were meant for prostitutes' hygiene, and then bidets vanished
Les Bouilleurs de Cru Ambulant !
They used to go to every village to make Gnole, a strong fruit Liquor with the fruits that the villagers recolted during the year, it used to be somewhat of a event where everybody were together, laughing, eating and drinking all day with the Bouilleur de Cru before going home with their barrel or bottles of Liquor for the year
Here I think it's snowy winters too
It has been years since we last got a real snowy winter
Although this year we got 3-4 days of kinda big snow, but still, the vast majority of the season, we don't have any snow
Makes me kinda sad, I love snow
I just came back from Namibia and the amount of bugs I had on my windshield reminded me of my childhood years in France
Now there's barely any insect left to kill just by driving
True artisanal boulangeries
Baker is a tough job, fewer youg bakers want to wake up at 4am to bake, so they become "bread depots" if I can say that
Resistance against the stupid decisions of the government
Ha llegado el afilador
Pretty funny, i learnt of the existence of such job (and, therefore, people) in Spanish classes, i guess it really was a thing
Oh man same here, yet last week, on my way back to work, on foot, I went through a little dirt road (I live in a small town), and there it was : a small hedgehog, probably young, drinking from a puddle
Didn't seem scared by me, but I pushed it out of the way cause cars go through that dirt road
They're a protected species nowadays in France
The Japanese are slowly but surely getting more French than us
That makes for a fantastic contrepèterie
It's forbidden now, cause the licenses to be a bouilleur de cru aren't renewed
It's a matter of taxes
Funny you should say that
I go to Portugal quite often and I’m always amazed at how much going to church is still going strong in your country
In France, church attendance is so low many of them don’t even open their doors on Sundays
Yeah it's the same in my town, only two bakeries left, there used to be a 3rd one where I would always go with my grandmother, the owner was a elderly lady who was dedicated *corps et âme* to her bakery, she really insisted that she wouldn't quit unless she died
Then eventually she closed her business, nowadays it's been bought up by three young chaps working as *traiteurs* (not sure of the English term)
I remember back when it was still a bakery/boulangerie, my mom worked briefly there with the owner
Now the only two left in my town are one in an Intermarché (the baguettes they sell taste off, their pâtisseries also taste bad) the 2nd one is outrageously pricy as Hell (seriously 3€ for a baguette ?! Vous êtes fou à lier, ma parole !) and their stock always get dilapidated by the clients
There was one doing it in my street too when I was little, but he retired & nobody took his place
They pretty much disappeared, now, I think
We had lots of ambulant professions, like the “tripoteuses”: women who would go from village to village & prepare the inhabitants’ meat (in such a way that it would last more than a few days: they’d smoke it, make sausages, make ham
Also, the milkman is no longer a thing
We are slowly adopting japanese toilets
I've still seen it in public toilets in my city not so long ago
Also they're not free
Even worse, they have a timer
Beware the timer if you're constipated
There is still a few of them, but i don't think they are more than a hundred in France now
My grandfather had two Lada Nivas, 1st one suffered a gearbox failure (lack of servicing killed it for the most part) 2nd one was rotten to the chassis (the seller had painted over the rust, it started showing up again, the paint's bubbling where the rust spots are) + engine died after my grandfather put diesel instead of petrol
Seeing them rotting away in his yard really pains me
Japan is in the future when it comes to toilets
They got bidets but with tons of electronics and stuff
In public WC
Slowly
Give them time
Mildly interesting : in France the correct word would be urinoir, pissoir seems to be Swiss French
Well, the more you know
No, I found it really strange when I saw one for the first time in th USA, I seams like something from an ancient time, something only sects would do
I also found strange that they were so many different style of church (not the building but the community and style)
Last time I checked, except jehovah witnesses, you never see any public reference to religion in IRL France (well, except for the lieux de cultes and religious associations, obviously, but most of them are sneaky)
I remember seeing a couple of billboards about Jesus in Slovakia, but nothing as bad as these examples
I don’t think it’s legal in France
There are, however, sometimes ads for religious charities
And when you enter Marseille by road, there is a big “CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS” painted on a house wall over the highway
Generally speaking, I don’t think Europe is really fond of big, colorless signs that are basically just a phrase screamed at you
I've never seen that around
That would be hella creepy
I've seen one "Jesus is your saviour" painting on a wall in Spain once, graffiti style, it actually looked cool
Other than that, no
In France it would be really awkward
France; nope
I live a 3m away from a church and never seen anyone in it
I don't think those religious billboard would be very long lived even if public proselytizism (orthograph ?) were allowed (no idea if it is probably not considering the rest of the forbidden religious stuff)
I can easily imagine them being defaced very very fast
Public demonstration of faith and references to faith like these are frowned upon in France
Maybe big religious places like Lourdes or popular pilgrimage way to Compostelle in Spain could have them maybe ?
I’ve seen one in my life
It was written on the side of a big truck trailer and parked up next to the side of a motorway for people to see
Just a simple “Jesus is Good” message that I assume the guy painted himself because it was bloody awful
There’s a guy who writes "Jesus loves you" (graffiti) everywhere in town here, probably a jehova guy or something
Was super strange to see one for the first time, like, dude, wth
>Last time I checked, except jehovah witnesses, you never see any public reference to religion in IRL France (well, except for the lieux de cultes and religious associations, obviously, but most of them are sneaky)
I thin it's forbidden due to laïcité?
I walk by them everyday, I didn't know what it mean as I don't speak polish
thanks for the translation haha
I guess it's more against same-sex marriage
Yes, you're right
You are not allowed to build any religious thing on a public building or area and such kind of poster are 100% illegal
But the french laïcité is such a rabbit hole, You could spend 3 days and 3 nights reading laws on it, and still not understanding exactly how it is applied
Surprisingly, mass is on public TV every Sunday morning in France
But other religions also have screen time on Sunday morning on the same channel
Laïcité à la Française
I recognized 'cult'.
I'd say Italian and Spanish actually
I've learnt Italian at school, and let me tel you that I am *bad* at it
But even if I can't speak it, I can still read it and get the gist of the text
Spanish is also quite easy to understand even though I never learnt it
I don't know what Romanian looks like but I'd really love to
Portuguese seems like a weird language to me, especially the prononciation
I can't understand it even when I try hard
Clearly Italian, most of the time we can get like 70~75% of what can be write on an information sign
I can understand Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (only written though), English (a lot of French loanwords make it easy to understand with no knowledge), Romanian (only written, and even sometimes I struggle reading it) and Hungarian (I must be the only one in the whole country tho)
As a French, none
Even though Spanish courses have been easier than English, I have a better understanding of English texts but that's really just experience
I'm sure Spanish would be like a second language on equal experience
Totally agree, Italian and Spanish are way more easy to read than Portuguese and Romanian
I think they are also easier than French-based creole (from Martinique for example)
I think the easiest language to understand for a french people is Catalan
Ex: **constitucion de Catalunya**
**Article 1
*De la sobirania de Catalunya*
Catalunya es constitueix en Estat democràtic de dret
**Article 2
*De l’Estat català*
La forma política d’organització de l’Estat és la república parlamentària
Els principis que regeixen l’ordenament jurídic de l’Estat són la llibertat, la justícia, la igualtat de drets i obligacions, l’avançament dels Drets Humans i la celebració de la diversitat
**Article 3
*Dels símbols nacionals*
La bandera de Catalunya és la tradicional de quatre barres vermelles sobre fons groc
L’himne oficial de Catalunya és ‘Els Segadors’.
La Diada nacional es celebrarà el dia 11 de setembre
Els símbols nacionals mereixen respecte, doncs representen una nació i els sentiments de pertinença dels seus habitants, però no poden ser mai imposats a ningú que no vulgui reconèixer-los com a propis
**Article 4
*De la llengua*
La llengua pròpia de Catalunya és el català. El català és, doncs, la llengua oficial de Catalunya, i l’emprada per l’administració de l’Estat
L’espanyol és llengua co-oficial de Catalunya, en virtut del dinamisme de què gaudeix al nostre país. El seu coneixement serà promogut entre la població. Els ciutadans de Catalunya que prefereixin expressar-se en aquesta llengua amb l’administració de l’Estat tenen dret a ser atesos sense discriminació de cap tipus
La parla aranesa serà objecte d’ensenyament i d’especial respecte i protecció.
Catalan is indeed *very* easy to understand, but I couldn't've known, it's the first time I read it
I would have said Italian aha !
I've gone in spain this summer and I understood nothing (that was not catalan but arround Basque Country)
Alcohol, complaining, the family dinner that ends up in a shouting match
Our inconditionnal love for good wine, charcuterie, bread and cheese
It’s very common in rural France, every family has their homemade « eau de vie » that they will offer after the meal
Same answer but with baguettes
Ah my sweet country :')
I'd say the saucisson and foie gras au petit dej' too
And the chocolatine vs chocolatine debate
Mind you, alcohol consumption has drastically diminished in the past decades in our country, especially regarding wine
First time I went to Spain we went to a bar early evening for after-hike drinks
We bought 3 rounds of drinks and with each round came tapas
Don't remember the first two plates, but the third was a huge plate of fries with pork in a creamy tomato sauce
Then we had to go back to the hotel for dinner
Yknow, as a Frenchman, I don't dislike the poldermodel
It's part of what makes living in NL such a pleasant experience, and there's a level-headedness in public discourse that's rarer elsewhere
Not by French standards I assure you
Foie gras au petit déjeuner
Once met a young guy on a ferry going to Dover
He was German but a Man Utd supporter and once a month he'd come over to watch a match
They do eau de vie with what they have, potatoes, pear, apples, whatever
I am sure you can do with grapes too
if you have some on your land
Et au gouter avec une tranche de nutella ;)
Je mange des tartines de coulomniers et du chocolat chaud perso, n'allons pas jeter la première pierre
I eat some every christmas
Disagreeing is not a bad thing my dude
Yknow, I thought so too (A'dam resident) and I attempted to escape to Randorp in a small cottage for a peaceful NYE
I did take a stroll through the village around midnight and every fucking house had their own nation-grade stash going off, not to mention the guys on one of the village squares having fun next to the historical churches
Madness
Everywhere
Sandwich made with a baguette, ham, cheese, butter (and potentially more things)
Our fast food is a bottle of wine, a saucisson, and a baguette with butter and cheese (or ham)
O'Tacos
You will never feel hunger again
The "traditional" one is just ham & butter, also known as a [jambon-beurre]
Also [galette saucisse] if you live in Brittany
In South Alsace we have the « mauricette » it is  sandwich made of bretzel batter
I think it only exists here
Oh, i thought it was the mitraillette
or some pâté de campagne or rillettes to spread on the baguette
Or, as I've noticed, more a beurre-jambon
Half a block of butter and some manky ham :(
Please, France, get more imaginative with your sandwiches (and the plural is not spelled 'sandwichs')
I think that's just Rennes/Ille-et-Vilaine
A croque monsieur is different because it is cooked
Smoked ham, cornichons and mayonnaise is where it's at
In Côtes d'Armor, you can find them as well
I like saucisson and cornichons
Displaying one is weird except during sporting events like the World Cup or the World Cup
So weird, no one is proud to be french
In France we unfortunately left the flag to nationalists ... Result is that it's very odd to have or display the national flag home or in public
In France, it’s considered to be offensive for other nationalities and therefore racist
i think a lot of people have a flag at home, for football matches for example, but displaying it in front of your house is weird and we could think that your from extreme right (which is not a really good thing)
Outside of sporting events, I would assume you are a far right supporter
You forgot May 2 - which is literally "Polish National Flag Day"
Except for the flag of some regions
Yes I do own a Breton flag and wave it everywhere I can
I would even automatically assume that people with French flag on their house when it's not the World Cup are racist far right people
I disagree
There is an ammount of people that have a flag on their window
Ah yes my flag of Ile De France
Well no
I prefer to remember 2018, especially for you :p.
It used to be very true, however I feel like in the recent years many people have started putting a flag, even if small ones, on their balcony for various reasons (terrorist attacks, World Cups) and just never removed them
which in most cases are some close minded racists
Yeah feeling the same
Terrorist attacks do tend to give more voters to the far right
I lived in Gloucestershire and I saw more Welsh flags around than English ones
Having a flag don't make you a fascist
It is stupid to think like that
Thinking like that is giving these people the exclusivity of the flag
I haven’t said EVERYBODY who flys a french flag is racist ....
Unfortunately no
My mum lives in the middle of the countryside, the few houses that fly are voting extreme right, then most of her area actually votes extreme right ...
I was at a busy campground in upstate NY years ago, and a lot of the folks had flagpoles with flags on them
I was in the Portsmouth area this summer
I didn't see a lot
But I suppose that with Brexit, more people put their flags out
[It's so stereotypical of your country that you guys even do it in France]
[this one ] would say
I can think of many pictures that most French people would immediately recognise and associate with historic events
Those ones are particularly famous
1° [Mitterand and Kohl holding hands] has become a symbol of the Franco-German reconciliation
The picture was taken at the Verdun memorial
2° [Charles de Gaulle's appeal of 18 June]
This picture was actually taken later but it is still widely used to illustrate Charles de Gaulle's radio speeches to the French people after he was forced to go to London
They were broadcast via the BBC
3° [President Chirac turnstile jumping]
That one is super famous in France too
(Though obviously not from one of our photographers or anything)
I'd say  [this one] is more well known
I thought of the same event but from another angle
Also, [that one] is pretty well known
Bonus: [not a picture, but everyone has seen that one]
It's amazing
It's an amazing photo, but fuckin' hell it's a horrible context
This guy is heartbreaking
À peu près pareil je pense
Mais la tienne est plus épique
I think the most well known french painting is [this one] or maybe [this one]
I prefer la Liberté to be honest
Probably the second one, you’re right
It's the second one
I prefer it too
It's a mild inconvenience, but could our Members of parliament stop talking about islamic veil for like five minutes and talk about real issues like climate change
Hate for the capital city
It so weird
Sure some (very rare) parisians look down on the rest of the country but everyone I've asked had no problems when moving to Paris
But if you try to move to another city from the capital and people will tend to be more hostile to you
When I went to study in another city, 90% of my new friends were actually morrocan from casablanca cause they didn't assume I'd be a dick without ever speaking to me
There are news stories of former parisians moving to other cities only to be told wrong directions when asking a local were to find something
In Marseille your car might even get damaged if it's immatriculated with a parisian license plate
So unwarranted
Smoking
I never smoked a single cigarette in my life
But people here smoke _so much_. I already saw parents smoking next to their baby or child, or even non-smokers
Plus the littering of the cigarettes
Like ugh, they're literally nothing good about smoking
France is one of the countries that smoke the most
Fortunatly it's decreasing, but slowly, and now people vape instead
It's not really better
Same in France, I’m a teacher too, let me tell you it’s downright shameful
rants are good
At least you're making yourself heard
same in france
It's gottent better but you'll still see garbage in the streets
It's annoying
Also people don't pick up after their dogs
I wish there was a bigger proximity police presence
thankfully there's municipal police in paris now and they seem to be doing a good job
what about work, bars or activities/club
also some dating apps have a "friend" option which you could try
What do you mean
Don't you find it unacceptable that you can buy hallal food in the supermarket
It's a disgrace
France is attacked at its core
We cannot allow that
Islamism is running rampant
Truly France has never been lower
And I'm not being racist, I have a friend who's [more black than arab]
hell nah fuck Paris dude, ive been there 3 times, ive had  awful experiences with parisians all of those times
Also i hate everything this city stands for and how the people in charge do to keep everything there
so you're agaisnt the lockdown
Europe isn't one unified country
Making such a broad generalisation about something is bound to be false
I obviously can't talk about the whole of europe but if you're part of the LGBTQ+ community, be more carefull in eastern conservative countries like poland
&#x200B;
In france you should be safe, I don't know about the countryside (though it doubt it's much worse) but in the cities there are very few cases of aggressions (1870  cases of homophobic or transphobic infractions in 2019 for the whole country)
None of my LGBTQ+ freinds have ever told me of harassement
It's definitley an issue but you won't be in any kind of danger
Being trans is probably what would put someone the most at risk, but once again it's extremely rare
kinda, it seems like the only viable solution to slow the epidemic until we get vaccines
> thinking it's a lasting step towards a totalitarian system with impacted basic human rights and corrupt media
Seems kind of absurd
Do you have so little faith in your government that you seriously believe they want to keep you at home
Also lockdowns are terrible for the economy and their reeelection so I'm sure they'd avoid it if they could
Additionally you'll notice that the politicians around the world who did not go into lockdown are the most self absorbed and/or crazy of the bunch (Trump, Bolsonaro, etc
As for corrupt media, sure some media might be bias but there are independant agencies that can tell you which sources have the least amount of bias and you can always sample from a wide range
> Some fear the vaccines might be tested to little, up to thinking they might sterilize them, mark them, or even impact them biologically
Not much to do with lockdown but common, there's a european agency tasked with testing that stuff and it's known for being particularly rigorous
> Some people think the virus might not be worse than a flu
just look at the numbers way more people died of covid in Germany in 2020 than of the flu in 2018
And in 2020 we had face masks, constant hand washing, and a few lockdowns
Imagine what the numbers would have been if no precautions had been taken
> there is no special virus at all
Don't you know at least one person who got covid
I know a few and one still can't taste anything months after
> scientific world rendered unreliable by capitalism
The scale of the conspiracy would be so massive
Why would every country on earth, some that have been at war or on the brink of it, suddenly work together to fabricate a false virus
Do you think everyone in the world of science has so little ethics as to not blow that conspiracy open right now
I grew up in Somme (where the dreadful battle of the Somme happened), it gives some perspective on what war is like when it happens on your own turf
No, not strange at all
I love in Paris: most streets have some kind of war memory & it shows
You’ll be having a walk, passing in front of a primary school, and suddenly there’s list of names: Jewish kids who studied here & were murdered
Same goes with some parks, when the kids were to young to even go to school
And there are plates everywhere of soldiers & resistance members who died during the liberation of Paris
It’s kind of hard to make these events sound distant when you have reminders at every corner
Plus, my grandparents were young adults during the war, and I’m only 20
It really was not that long ago, one/two generations
Little enough time that I’ve heard family history/tales about it
WWII is relatable
My grandfather was a soldier, I heard his horror stories
And beyond my personal story, the siren blast monthly, the buildings have bullet scars, there's memorial plaque for every person shot for fighting or resisting, plaques in schools with the lists of kids that were deported
We can't forget but it's a good thing because we shouldn't forget
War has been the default setting of Europe for so long, peace is stranger than war
Never understood war, guns or violence
Never know it so, no
I lived in Lille, a northen French city that has been bombed the shit out of it for various reasons, it was weird seeing building that survived the bombing, next to brand new building , next to post war ones
I now live in Paris and two street next to where I live used to be a gestapo hq
That kind of stuff is everywhere in europe and works as a reminder that long time peace is something that a lot of people paid a hard price for
Apparently here, there's only 12 municipalities (out of the country's 36
000 in total) where no conscript died in WW1
In the north-east, close to the border with Germany, there are also several dozens of villages that have been completely leveled and never rebuilt, sometimes because there was too many unexploded ammunition a still lying around
Out of these, 6 municipalities have a mayor, but no inhabitants, and he's officially appointed by the state to maintain the memorials in these villages
Same for my hometown Lorient
There was a German submarine blockhaus near her, the allies bombers have destroyed the whole city but the blockhaus is still there, not even damaged and today it's a museum
It does make a difference because "your country" refers to the government
The government started the wars
Not some random grandparents
>  cause it is still your grandparents
No it's not, you were "lucky" that the person you talked to did have a Nazi Grandpa
But that's it
Also, you don't know the age of the perso you're talking to
You could speak to a 21 year old, and I bet his or her grandparents didn't start anything
It blasts every first Wednesday of the month at noon
The revolution led to the creation of the metric system and put a lot of ressources to force its utilization so I don't think we have much
I only heard my father use a pound (0
5kg) once
In French there's the archaic "lieue" that is roughly 4km long, and the measurement system of the Middle Ages that used pi, phi (golden number) and the metre in its relations before they were even (re)discovered
In France, we usually count with baguettes until 3 or 4 years old
Well, we Invented Metric
So, not really traditional (even if it's a few centuries old) and not special anymore since it spread around, but I think it kinda counts for your question
~~All to say, our measurement is stronger than your measurement system
Some areas of France, mostly rural, have unofficially kept pints (pintes) and pounds (livres) only for milk and bread
Both weigh 500g.
We also have the quintal here
Le cirque de Gavarni in France is just otherworldly
Interesting that everyone puts Notre Dame in Paris first
There is [the cathedral of Reims] which was built around the same time, with the same kind of gothic style, but is more sophisticated (statues everywhere) and historically important in France's history
Agree that the Mont Saint Michel has a better place in this list though
Honestly, I get it
I’m Jewish and my family were ravaged by the Shoah but I don’t think it’s inappropriate to include something like that here
When we talk about a wonder of the world, it doesn’t mean something that’s really, really brilliant
It’s something impactful and doesn’t have to be spectacular because it’s beautiful or a source of good
The Pyramids aren’t a Wonder because everybody loves elaborate tombs for rich blokes that were probably built by slaves
You’re all listing the Colosseum but nobody thinks that forcing prisoners to fight for their lives against wild animals is the pinnacle of entertainment
It’s about the place these places have within European heritage and tbh I can’t think of anywhere more powerful
I've never heard of this before, I am truly amazed
I knew the Dutch were the world's best for these kinda stuff but it's still impressive
Look at the actual Wonders
They’re not on the list because they’re wonder*ful*. They’re there because they’re of immense importance to world heritage
It doesn’t mean “wow this is really, really great”. The Coliseum is where prisoners and wild animals were forced to fight to death in the most barbaric conditions
The Pyramids were probably built by slaves and forced labourers to give some rich bloke a fancy tomb
Nobody’s saying “oh wow, that’s brilliant”. They’re on the list because they’re spectacular, innovative, and yeah, often terrible but they’d had such an impact on the culture of a country (and beyond) that they are remarkable
Yeah I learned some stuff about the Netherlands lmao, like almost half the country is below sea level
I suddenly love you
Uh because European culture *was* twisted into blind hatred for a people who bore no guilt
You can’t pretend that it wasn’t a massive cultural shift which continues to impact us for generations
The Jewish people of Europe have *never* recovered from being almost entirely wiped out
You can pretend like this is all in the past, and yet my adoptive grandma whose own cultural beliefs forbid tattoos, has a tattoo on her arm with the numbers that were her identity instead of her name
There are still fewer Jews in the world now than there were before the Shoah
Our numbers have never recovered from what several European culture allowed to happen
Where are the missing tens of millions of my Jewish brethren who should be here now and where are their own distinct cultures which were wiped out
I’m very happy for you that you get to sit safe at home in Austria and think “What does a concentration camp have to do with European culture
” but, as I’d like to tell you from my Jewish community in England, from my synagogue that’s had swastikas carved into the walls: Aushwitz has *everything* to do with European culture but it seems some people have the privilege of forgetting that
Love
herm
finds a way
Joking :)
Drinking Wine, mostly
I guess French culture is known for a sum a things that you learn to appreciate with time
When i was a tadpole, i thought the french left not going lib-dem flavour was somewhat backwards
And you know you face a conflit because you want to vouch for you country to feel like part of the goodies but you also got tv up in a corner of a room whispering you what's cool according to a board of obnoxious old farts
Now i don't vouch so much for what makes talk show hosts wet
French humanities classics never hyped many (french) teenagers, while they're worth giving a shot later in life – or sooner
Also, the place for meals in daily life start making sense as you begin your career
Those meals have nothing about gastronomy, nor sustentation or a political stance, but are an attempt at something tribal, mindful, that infuse some meaning in your work day
And then comes the things i came to hate…
Yes, speaking Basque is my dream
Nah, but my family have tried to make me drink wine since I was 12
They said Latin alphabet
Wok to walk, made in Amsterdam, it's in every major city, even a few in France, but none in Paris
We still use email/mail
I never heard someone ask for a gmail
(also, nobody says the "proper" word aka "courriel")
Absolutely no one except maybe some official documents use "courriel", everyone says "mail"/"email".
No one uses courriel
It's the same thing for "texto" honestly
I haven't heard anyone use the word in years, everyone around me says SMS
However, I think they both are the official french words though, as defined by the Académie, which is why they are used by journalists, authors, and the government
For "GSM" though, that's just the name of the standard for 2G network protocols
Using it to mean mobile phone is the same as saying "gmail" for "email".
Southern France
"texto" *is* used just not a lot compared to SMS, maybe I just don't notice it when it is
england
Germany
italy/roman empire
spain
austria
Is it normal to feel sad when I don't see France in the top 3
Monaco
United Kingdom
Italy
Andorra
Spain
There are two that are very important: Germany and the UK
There is the major ones: Italy and Spain
Maybe the Habsburgs, the US and Russia at some point but really other countries aren't nearly as important as those 4
I mean I think people already do learn our country's history
England
Germany
Maybe Italy because of François Ier and Napoléon ?
Yeah, we're a pretty self centered people, I know
>  Basque country
What is the link between the Basque and Iceland ? Never heard of such connection tbh
> Honourable mention of France
I mean France wasn't that involved in the area until the 19th century I'd think your neighbors might be above no ?
Nincs is Franciaország? Úgy értem, Tr*anon
I wish the auld alliance was talked about more over here
I never heard about it in school and had to search before stumbling upon it
> helped us counter England
Hell yeah we can help anyone as long as it annoys the rosbifs
Austria above Algeria
I would definitely add Scotland
Italy waaay above Russia
I'm a bit curious about what France did with Iceland
Seems a bit difficult since the Gauls weren't a country, Greece wasn't united, and there is probably something about Israel too
depends what you count as algeria, then independant entity that lasted until today, ok sure we learn more about them
&#x200B;
but the area and the people are older then that and before that france only played a minor role in the area
I mean Algeria didn't exist before France created it so basically they have been ours for like 100 years and have been a close but not so close relationship for 60 years
The US  are way above Algeria for example
Imo Austria is a good pick because it has been around for a long time and has always been a powerhouse of Europe
There is probably a lot to say about Russia, the Ottomans, the North and Portugal too and we might also count the great kingdoms of the middle age that have dissapeared today like Burgundy or Provence but Algeria is really far behind
Try asking questions about Maori and New Zealand
Also this is about Europe, no need to bring other painful memories
Many European countries did horrible things
Yeah, It's Italy that should be there (heck I'd put them above Spain and Austria), between the link between the monarchy and the papacy, and the numerous French kings who made a hobby of trying to plunder northern Italy, or their link with the Naples thrones, the fights with the Austrians/Spaniards there, Renaissance we copied from them
Way too many link with Italy to not put them in the top 5
Are the programmes very different between the landers
Didn't knew that, I thought it was mostly because of France involvement in a lot of Ottomans dismantlement shenanigan and WW1
Well TIL for the law inspiration I guess
Thanks for the answer
Now that I think about it we didn't talk a lot about the 100 year war to begin with, so I guess that's why
Sorry, I had misundertstood your intent
I am old, so I remember very well the Greenpeace boat
I remember French speaking usenet was unusable for a while, full of new zealanders insulting French people
It was a sad time
Thanks for the infos
Always nice to learn new things
> that Napoleon said "give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world"
I seem to remember a Polish comment on reddit saying he said the same thing about Polish soldier, so it's either something he said multiple time, or he at least said something like that at some point (for whom though ?)
Ban
Nah
Regulate
Yes
I actually don't mind lootboxes
As far as I know, the issue is that kids / "weak" people may spend way too much money on those things without noticing
This is due to microtransactions, not lootboxes
Yes, both sometimes come together, but so does most of the pairs of things you can think of
There are even games with lootboxes that you can't buy but only earn through playing the game
If a regulation should take place, it should be about how microtransactions are integrated to games
For example you should be able to block yourself for spending more than a defined amount
Also the presence of microtransactions should be indicated the same way PEGI are, that way the parents would be able to control the spending of their children (unless they are bad parents, but regulations can't really correct that), and people that have issues with gambling could decide to avoid the game
About the "gambling" nature of lootboxes
Well, I get your point: some people completely loose their mind when gambling
There could be regulations to make that more sane, like making it clear what exactly you can get in your box (most of the games I play already do that, so maybe this regulation already exists
), or having an available setting that makes the website unable to validate payments (so that if you purchase something thinking it was free you just get told it actually wasn't free, and don't loose your money), like if you never gave them your payment infos in the first place
Especially since they most likely know the back end (aka what's in the lootboxes)
Fortnite doesn't have lootboxes, at least where the big money is made, aka not Save the World
Epic is even pulling them from Rocket League
F2p will take over gaming by 2025 no matter what, lootbox ban or not
r/Yurop
Yurop
is now reaching new frontiers, and sending men where no one else wa before
The colony on the moon Europa, called "Yurop 2" was established some years, and it seems that Yuropean unity has no limits
In the near future, if we don't succeed in counteracting the big rise of nationalist thought, who knows what will happen
If we don't reform quickly the obsolete unanimous vote Europe is running towards disintegration, we need a strong political Europe more than ever
(It also implies the power to eject habitual abusers
Probably not very different from the rest of earth : a mess of a wasteland where humans have to use force to stay alive
This being said, it'll probably be a very old population, as it's already pretty bad now and will get only worse
Controlled by the CCCP
This post is about envisioning 100 years in the future, dude
Not telling what you wished for 50 years ago
Don't worry my over-the-Rhine neighbor, the EU is important to a lot of people here too
Some euroscepticism exists of course, but to me, EU is the only way Europe can compete in the future
And I do feel European, but I still feel French
It's a weird mix
In France they are weird-clown parties
They won few towns in municipal elections recently and they are now famous for their weird statements, such as cyclism competitions are sexist and they don't want that in their towns, or Christmas tree is a dead tree and we should not encourage people to party around dead tree
Stuff like that
And we've landed spacecrafts on comets and asteroids
No, youth in France also have a strong EU identity, same thing for every founding nations
Not all youth
RN party has litteraly the most support from youth
I'd say there is more a european sentiment rather than a will to have an european nation
You are way too optimistic
And my France !
Since French was one of the instigator of the EU, and as been heavily implicated in the WW2, I would say that yes, indeed, there’s a strong connection, I would even say that’s why Germany and France are perceived as the two “leaders” of the EU
You guys need to make a difference between the European identity and European federalism
Doesn’t the RN like to encompass on the European Identity, with his Christian roots and Roman heritage ? Obviously yes, it doesn’t mean that they support the European Union though, but they sure support the idea of the European Identity
"The franco-german couple" is a common saying here
I would say that there is a lot since the meme community in France is huge on Facebook
Theses groups, called neurchi are specialized on one subject and are often really creative
For instance neurchibald de tintin is a neurchi focused on making memes with the comic Tintin and are really funny
We have bad jokes about fishes on r/rance
That's all I could think about
Yeah, translating everything in bad French for example (attends, c'est tout France ? - Toujours a été) but we have plenty of them
Tintin is widely known so template used in French can be translated and understood to someone abroad, to a certain extent of course
Kaamelott memes on the other hand, if you don't speak French and don't have the context I wouldn't know where to start to explain what it is
I’d say that the ones with OSS 117 are pretty much exclusive to France
I would add Denis Brogniart's "AH !", it can easily be translated even leaving as is, but I've never sen it anywhere other than French websites or used by French people
Et les memes de la Cité de la Peur aussi
Ouais, mais sinon
Snoop Doggy Dogg, qu'est-ce-qu'on attend ?
C'est pas faux
Other french memes can be :
* Palmashow  (based on two humourist videos)
* memes décentralisés (based on the struggles of the contryside's way of life)
* C'est pas sorcier (based on a child science show)
You can also find a niche in the JVC community, a video game forum which mascott is Risitas

One of the most famous memes as well
Un classique !
Vous allez m'arrêter pour mangeage de choucroute interdire ?
Barrez vous cons de memes !
Is that your Schnappi ?
I'm also thinking about this absolute legend :
The madlad
Not the meme we wanted, but the meme we needed
What is you "brother" country ?
What is the country you have a more intimate relationship with that no other country has ?
Like for example, France and Belgium are very close as we share the same language, a patrimony somewhat related, etc
South of France, it can be Italy, Spain or Switzerland, especially since close to those countries, French is not the only language spoken (especially near Perpignan), and Switzerland with the Franco-German mix
However I’d say our real brother nation here is Monaco  ! (In particular since if the king does not have an heir, they would become French)
France has Wallonia (French-speaking part of Belgium) as a sister, as opposed to Belgium as a whole
Still love you Flemish people
Wow I didn't expect so many responses
Thank you guys very much
It is really interesting !
Historically speaking, I'd say first Italy with the roman empire, Germany with the Franks and Charlemagne, then England with the Normands
I personally feel more connected to Germany, coming from thé north easy of France
I do not consider Belgium a "brother" country the same way
Feels more like a twin (for wallony) or a member of my own body
Smth like this
None really, there has been a whole culture movement since the early XVIIIth century that sees Japan as our bizarro world equivalent but that's about it
Not sure where you heard about that France / Belgium brotherhood
Our brother country is Italy, no questions asked
It's like that brother you love, you share everything with but you hate at the same time
Similar food culture, luxuous countries, close latin language, Paris and Rome (Only Paris deserves Rome, and only Rome deserves Paris) , one of the oldest history on earth, café, terrasses, etc
Funny because French people don't see Germany as our brother country at all
I'd say it's Italy for France, Germany is more like our nemesis haha
Aber Deutschland liebe ich trotzdem, mit freundliche grüßen aus dem Elsass ;)
Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland are our three little kids
Belgium is a little disturbed but I'm still proud of what did the two younger
You eastern fellas are sometimes a mystery to us westerns
Ukraine deserves love
Real love
I kinda envy how close Northern countries are to eachother
A Danish friend of mine once explained to me that Northern relationships were a bit complicated to understand though
In a funny way I mean
Yeah it's some kind of brotherly relationship like there are some intense arguments but at the end of the day we still love each other
It really does haha
Funny how Netherlands and France are Belgium's big brothers, but they never relate together
France and Germany do have a big friendship, but I feel the Netherlands are closer in terms of patrimony etc (correct me if I'm wrong)
I’d say Germany, because of trade, but agreed that’s not really felt in southern France (neither, I guess, is it when you’re in Lille and work with Belgians daily)
I would never have guessed tbh
Huh
I don't feel that at all
I worked 2 times in Germany, I did one Erasmus there, and (at least, for me) they are the closest brother of France
We are also making a "French-Germany" union quite often within the EU
For me, UK is more an nemesis, if I could say that
But a nemesis that we always take care and fight like a little sister
I feel differently
Maybe because I made more German friends than Italian while living abroad
There are differences, but at the end of the day we have similarities with all our neighbours
Well, Istria used to be part of Italy and it really shows
Beautiful place
I don't know, I never hear anything bad said about Switzerland in France, but it seems a Swiss person can't go a day without crapping on France
Don't get me wrong Germany is definitely very very close to France when it comes to cohesion, cooperation and economic development
But in term of culture, living style and history, I don't think that Germany is close to us at all, especially if compared to Italy
Mais je suis d'accord avec toi dans l'absolu, je vis en Alsace et la cohésion Franco-allemande est extrêmement développée et présente, et j'ai beaucoup d'expérience avec l'Allemagne tout comme toi haha ;)
The Norwegians have it good I see
Sorry, I don't understant what's funny about that joke
Mon expérience est plus proche de ce que je vois sur ce thread, dans lequel je ne vois pas de critique des suisses
mais bon c’est juste mon expérience
Je comprends plutôt bien le message d'origine, et je n'ai jamais appris l'espagnol
Je ne comprends pas forcément les mots individuellement, mais le sens des phrases est assez facile à deviner
Je comprends encore mieux les messages en Italien, mais j'en ai fait un peu au collège et au lycée... Je ne serais plus capable de parler mais i' me reste forcément des notions
Donc c'est très facile à lire pour moi
J'ai plus de mal avec les commentaires qui sont dans d'autres langues
Je pourrais sûrement réussir à les déchiffrer mais ça me semble plus compliqué que l'espagnol et l'italien
Je parle pas mal de langue mais des latines je parle français, italien et espagnol
. Du coup j'ai très bien compris ce que tu as écris
Il faut dire que j'ai beaucoup de mal avec le catalan et le roumain
Et des légères complications avec la compréhension du portugais
Sinon ça va
Et toi t'as compris ?
J'ai étudié l'espagnol et puis l'italien à l'école donc forcément j'ai de la facilité à comprendre les commentaires dans ces langues
Avant, le portugais me paraissait complètement abscons mais après avoir étudié les différences systématiques entre portugais et espagnol, c'est devenu très facile à lire
Le catalan est aussi facilement compréhensible malgré le fait que je ne l'ai jamais étudié. En revanche le roumain reste très compliqué même si on devine certains mots
Il existe déjà un projet sur l'intercompréhension entre langues romanes :
Cette méthode vise à développer des stratégies de lecture pour deviner le sens de textes en langues romanes
Ce serait une bonne idée de créer un subreddit pour qu'on puisse développer ensemble l'intercompréhension entre romanophones !
Je ne pensais pas que j’en comprendrais autant
Mais ça demande de la concentration, surtout les premières phrases
Après un peu d’entraînement ça devient plus facile et on reconnaît plus vite les racines commune
Même les terminaisons des verbes se ressemblent
C’est incroyable, avec un peu de travail on pourraient tous se comprendre dans nos propre langues, au moins à l’écrit
J'ai du mal à te comprendre, tu parles d'anglais à un moment, comme contrepoint aux langues latines
Je compreder plus ce que tu escrito dans ton deuxième paragraphe, mais c'est quand même un peu un jeu de devinettes
Ça peut valoir la peine de préciser que je n'ai jamais appris d'autres langues latines, ni vivantes ni mortes (juste anglais et allemand)
Je trouve l'italien un peu plus facile à comprendre que le castillan, catalan ou portugais
Les Roumains pourraient aussi bien me parler en chinois, je ne les comprendrais pas mieux
J'ai pu comprendre assez bien car j'ai fait espagnol au lycée même si je suis très mauvais
C'est une question très intéressante
Je vais poster un poème de ma composition car je trouve que c'est marrant :
Voici ce qui occupe toute ma pensée :
La clarté bleue de l'âme volante qui occupe le ciel,
Notre sœur la Lune et toute sa beauté.
Comment puis-je rester de marbre face à un tel miel ?
Je ne peux tout simplement pas
Elle me regarde
Comprendre une langue latine parce qu’on parle déjà français ? Pas convaincue
Par contre , avoir des facilités d’apprentissage surtout en espagnol, que la majorité des élèves apprennent en cours , ça oui , tout a fait
C'est pas drôle parce que j'ai suivi des cours d'espagnol pendant 5 ans haha
Du coup j'ai compris 100% de ce que tu as dis !
En vrai, avant de commencer à apprendre l'espagnol, je pouvais le lire un petit peu
Le français et l'espagnol se ressemble tout de même beaucoup !
Personnellement j'ai très bien pu comprendre le message d'origine, mais cette aisance est certainement due au fait que je fais de l'espagnol depuis plusieurs années
En ce qui est des autres langues latines, j'ai plus de mal à les comprendre mais elles restent globalement compréhensibles (au niveau du contexte de la phrase ou du texte) à l'écrit, et je pense que beaucoup de français peuvent dire la même chose
Merci pour ce post original et intéressant au passage !
J'ai personnellement entièrement compris tes phrases en espagnol, sûrement parce que j'étudie cette langue en cours
J'arrive à peu près à comprendre l'italien et le portugais (seulement à l'écris), mais l'allemand et le roumain c'est autre chose
Je ne m'attendais pas à autant d'Italiens
Salut, je triche forcément un peu pour ton post vu que je parle déjà espagnol, en revanche c'est toujours plaisant de voir qu'on se comprend très bien entre langues latines
A l'écrit en tout cas
J'imagine qu'à l'oral ces différent
J'espère que vous allez tous bien et qu'on va pouvoir sortir de chez nous bientôt.
J'ai compris la majorité de ce que tu as dit
J'ai compris une bonne partie de l'OP, et quand je regarde les différentes conversations dans ce thread, j'en comprends une bonne partie
J'ai un peu plus de mal avec le portuguais et le roumain que l'italien et l'espagnol par contre
J'ai à peu près tout compris, mais j'étudie l'espagnol donc c'est normal
J'ai aussi beaucoup de facilités avec l'Italien, et je ne sais pas pourquoi mais le portugais est plus dur
Le roumain est par contre étonnement compréhensible
98% mais c'est parce que j'ai étudié l'espagnol a l'école sinon je comprendrais pas et je comprendrais encore moins l'italien et le portugais
Je crois que de toutes les langues le français est la plus éloignée du latin c'est pour ça que notre orthographe est moins intuitif c'est parce qu'il garde la structure des mots latins avec une autre prononciation
Romance or Roman ? IDK, I am ignorant French :)
Anyway, I vaguely understood your post, especially last question, while not speaking Russian at all
Ahahah :)
Je pense que c'est parce que j'étudie un peu l'espagnol mais j'ai un peu compris ce que tu as dit ! C'est trop bien !
J'ai compris 99% de ce que tu as dis, je suis pas sur du mot "spiegare", comprendre ?  Au début je n'arrivais pas du tout à comprendre l'italien mais ça fait deux semaines que j'essaye d'apprendre la langue avec duolingo
Je sais également parler portugais et espagnol assez bien, du coup par chevauchement ça aide avec l'italien
I don't understand trainstation ??
I only know extremely basic stuff for german and "Ich versteh nicht" is one of the first thing I learnt haha
Je parle le francais et l'espagnol, et j'ai etudie l'italien a l'ecole, mais la je comprends rien du tout
Everything but I learnt latin and I read Ceasar's commentaries so there's that
Well, I almost instantly recognized what this was from, so it was pretty easy
Caesar also purposely wrote in very simple terms because he wanted everyone to understand what he was saying (this was read aloud on the forum so even illiterate people could understand), so I'd generally have an easier time with this than with your average Latin sentence
Also, I did two two years of Latin in middle school
Vous y perdez sur l'allemand et les autres langues germaniques, mais ça doit quand même aider pour comprendre les langues latines, non
Ya genre 30% de votre vocabulaire qui est directement tiré de l'ancien français (avec juste une aphérèse ici et là)
TIL, thanks
oof , là c'était plus compliqué. mais je pense avoir compris quand même aussi !
Eine wunderschöne Antwort
Danke
In France, we also throw rice at the newlyweds, but after they exit the town hall

Just to let you know it's spelled 'awkward', but I really love your spelling
It would make life easier, that's for sure
Do you have 'funny' letters that are pronounced a certain way
I'm thinking of some languages, where 'c' at the end of a word is said 'ch'.
Super interesting, many thanks
I'm guessing Cyrillic is what is normally written
Keep it the same
It’s the regional flag I’d rather redesign
I wouldn't , I love my Flag : Simple , easy to reconize and has inspired a ton of other flags
Note to self : rosbeefs have dumb dumb flag
Tricolour good
Personnellement, j'aime bien celui utilisé par le conseil constitutionnel avec la brodure RF au centre
You're reall trying to make a french and a brit agree ?
Dude this doesn't piss off the americans so I can't agree
No worries, I was joking
But TBH tricolours have existed since the dawn of ages we didn't invent the thing
We didn't invent it but we made it popular
Now that's the spirit !
In France in some famillies (not sure abt most) it can be normal to ask a young adult to participate to the familly budget if he/she is making money and staying home
This is to give them an hint of the value of money and also give them a voice on how home is supposed to function ...
&#x200B;
But also many famillies (more mediteranean i believe) won't ask any money and some other will ask full money and give something back ...
&#x200B;
I guess here,just like anywhere else, you will find all possibilities
I think so
Really depends on the family tho
If you have a job, I think it's kind of expected that you at least contribute to the household spendings
I've heard multiple cases of parents charging full-on rent, tho at discounted rates usually
I've never heard of parents charging rent
We don't have a national pet as far as I know, we do have the rooster as our national animal though
Why is his name "papillion" ? It's butterfly in French lmao
I love him
This
I was not even into football at the time, and I know about him
Ooh I see thanks
French looks like you decided to try and get more points playing Scrabble by adding as many letters as you can
It’s either :
- beautiful language
- gay ass language
Either "Baguette language" or something like this (i can only think of this cliche
The only direct comment I got was that it sounded sensual
My Italian roommate told me that after overhearing me talking to my mother about banking
I suppose it depends on where the foreigner comes from:
Outside of Europe, I usually have people tell me that French sounds beautiful
Once, someone told it sounds like silk on skin, which surprised me because we have guttural and nasal sounds which can be off-putting for some
Speaking of, if they come from Europe they usually describe it as a mix of Italian and Spanish but worse
And that's the nicest one I have heard
We don't have a good reputation as I have come to discover from this sub :(
And there is this idea that it’s uselessly complex (the grammar)
But I don’t know if people really think that way or if it’s just a thing French people tell each other
I've been living in Netherlands, and heard many germans speaking there
Dutch is so much worse than german
German is so soft as a language, it really feels germans people can't do no harm
And then there is the dutch, which sounds like they are going to murder you when they ask what's for dinner
Lol you killed me
I laughed so hard
Thanks for that
(Same happens with French, which is probably the reason why I can relate: “je t’aime, vive la France, Tour Eiffel, café, où sont les toilettes ?”)
It’s nice, sounds very music-y. I think that’s where the Lord of the Rings comment comes from (it could also be that Tolkien used Irish to craft some of his languages
Don’t know but it doesn’t seem like a silly thing to think)
But then, I never heard someone speak Irish, just went to a museum where the audios were in both English and Irish
There’s this idea that it’s musical, though, because of the way you accentuate the words
My English teachers always told me to thinks of the English sentence as a landscape with little hills (I’m French)
You’re the second Irish whose comment I’ve read here, and now I badly want to know if Tolkien studied Irish language
Edit: it does sound music-y, btw, I like it
Not trying to be mean, but what you described is exactly what I imagine when I hear spoken Dutch
Thats funny because i never heard it like that
I did hear "discount italian" though
Thatt one had me crack up
I for once always thought it was a legend, glad you confirmed it
I think that it might be that both Italia and French are hard to learn for English-peaking people
The imperfect and transpassato subjunctive (subjonctif imparfait et plus-que-parfait) are still used but either in a very very very specific context, or when written
It’s true that people will think you’re posh if you used those like it’s an everyday thing
I had a teacher last year that wanted our whole class to use it all the time as a joke (I’m studying littérature and won’t bore you with more details
Last thing: we do use the subjonctif (“je pense que tu serais”, it just means something else)
The spelling actually makes sense when you look at it’s etymology
For example, we write “hôpital” (hospital) with this accent because there once was a -s before that -p. Those exact accent is always used to show that a -s disappeared
Same with other things, really: it all comes down to etymology
I find it fascinating
People usually keep that one for French men they meet, I think
I’m a woman and nobody ever told me that one, it’s hilarious
Haha, an English man once told me every French word he knew in a single sentence: the end was “Garçon, où sont les toilettes s’il vous plaît ?” Always wondered where that came from
“Que tu saches”, sorry
I’m not used to the names of these things in English (and, to be honest, I use these correctly -as far as I know- but am terrible at naming them
You might be a beginner but you’re already better at it than I am
We would say “I faut que tu saches ça avant de prendre ta décision” (You need to know this before taking a decision -is that proper English
Sounds very French to me) for example
As for the specific things, it’s more about present subjonctif: we use it for past things (Il aurait fallu que je le fasse avant de partir/I should have done it before leaving) but it’s just not very common because it’s formal language
It’s not that you never hear them, more that it’s rare
If someone tell me “Il aurait fallu que je finisse mes devoirs”, I won’t find it that strange but I might notice it (in a “oh, a bit unusual” but not in a “what’s this thing
” kind of way)
As for the imperfect subjonctive, it fell out of use but we still read it, as it’s used in lots of novels for example
Also, I’m not sure I get your example
And I really want to ask why, for the “you think you are” thing
To be honest, I only have one friend that studied Italian and he once said that the language was not that tricky
except when it comes to verbs
He said that it was a little similar, in that way, to Spanish: it’s roughly easy to learn the basics, but becoming fluent is way harder -most notably because of the tenses
Exactly the same on the conditional
“Je pense que tu serais un bon maître” is grammatically correct but this use of the word “maître” mostly fell out of use, it sounds like something a student from the 1930s would say -it’s very “vieille France”. We’d rather use the word “professeur” (cut down to “prof” in casual conversation)
I get what you say about the infinitive, though it’s not the way we use it in French
We go at it the same way English do, “I think that Marcus is good”/Je pense que Marcus est bon, gentil” (“good” really sounds like food in this context)
Sometimes we turn the verb into a word, this might be the French version of the infinitive
“Je pense que Marcus est une bonne personne” (I think Marcus is a good person)
(Also, side note: some French authors, such as Jean de La Fontaine, really admired this construction of the sentence in Latin
He wrote that the Latin sentence has a briefness and clarity that French could not achieve
We can use infinitive sentences (where the verb is an infinitive), but it’s uncommon
It’s a translation but I think that “être ou ne pas être” (to be or not to to be) would be an example of such a sentence
Again, I think that French and English are similar here
I don’t know why we translate the names of famous people and places
Believe mec it can be a nightmare
My current studies do that I have to learn English to French translation (and French to English, for that matter): sometimes we translate those, but sometimes we don’t bother
If a well-known translation exists, I’m supposed to use it, otherwise I have to let things as they are
We do that for fictional characters, too: Frodo from Lord of the Rings became Frodon in Le Seigneur des Anneaux, but Aragorn stayed Aragorn
A nightmare
I think that it comes from a translation usage at a time
And probably from days when people were afraid that French culture would disappear/melt and be replaced by English, too
(It my be a spelling mistake but we say Baudelaire, not Boudlaire
And we also say Kepler and Bacon)
As for the accent
we do not really think about it on an everyday basis
It might come, for a part, from the same habit of “frenchising” (franciser) names, or from a lack of understanding of the correct pronunciation
Lots of my friends don’t put the correct accents simply because they feel ridiculous, knowing that they do not achieve the right tone anyway and that it seems strange (I do this too)
French is not a very accentuated language, I think, and if it is I’m not aware of it, so when we try to accentuate things it often comes out forced and not very natural
I think that you’re right on French people: we don’t like to say it, but we are indeed nationalist on that we are often proud of our country
Because of our history, regional identities are not really a thing, but those that are are kind of strong -most of them
Also, these regions often feel very French no matter what (never, never
tell an alsacien that they are not French
Very bad idea)
(Also, thanks for the talk, I’m really enjoying it though I don’t know Italian at all, and I learned a ton of things already

Yes, I do
Last year, my neighbors didn't lock their door when they went to the grocery store (5 minutes away from our building) and in the span of 10 minutes, their apartment was burgled
Also as a woman living alone, I would never feel safe knowing my door isn't locked
But that's probably because I live in a city with lots of weird and creepy people
Yes but only because my toddler like to open it and try to take the elevator by himself
If he's not here I don't: there is no handle on the other side so you need the key to open it
I our country house we only lock it at night
During the day it's safe outside (no car or anything, we know well every neighbors (all of them have our key) and anyway if someone enter the house is 3 centuries old: every step is loud so we would here it even if you're watching a movie on the second (thirds for american) floor
If we're out of the village, we don't lock it either: elderly neighbors are more efficient than any security camera to spot a stranger
I do because it reminds me of taking the keys with me when I go out
My door do not have an handle on the outside
I didn't in France (rural) but some English chick keeps coming in, uninvited, i bought a post office it's pretty amusing grannies asking for stamps when I'm eating breakfast
When i know that someone is coming let say 9h i left it open at night, if not nah recently
I live in rue Ordener, Paris 18, so yes
When I'm at home : keys locked on the door
And I have a 3 points lock
Je suis un mec et j'ai deux gros chiens
Du coup je laisse ouvert et si yen a un assez con pour ouvrir ça me fera des économies de croquettes
[Tribute]
Same here
I’d gladly lock it during the night only but I know I’d forget to do it
So just to be safe I lock it as soon as I arrive home
I've had a drunk man knock on my door once (the door of the building doesn't work well sometimes, I guess he took this opportunity to enter the building)
He was quite aggressive and I was glad my door was locked
Djaune méïde iz ouai tou eu taveurn srou zeu darke forèste, aunely tou faïnde ahoute zate i faurgote ze meuni
We don't have the "th" sounds, so I replaced /θ/ with /s/, and /ð/ with /z/.
Djone méid hiz wée tou eu taveurn trou ze dark foreste, aunnely tou faïnde aoûtte zat hi foregotte ze moné.
French :
Djone méïde iz ouéille tout euh taveurne srou ze d'Arc foreste, oneli tout faïnde août zat i forgotte ze moni
"Jaune maid iz waye tau a taverne trou zeu dark forresst, onli tau finnde oute zat i  faurrgaute zeu mauni"
In French, "i" is pronounced "e", and "ou" is pronounced "oo"
John a trouvé son chemin jusqu'à une taverne à travers une forêt sombre, tout ça pour remarquer qu'il a oublié son argent
In French
I was about to post my attempt at a French "translation" but your answer is perfect
You went to great lengths to try and keep French pronunciation rules
Looking at this, one can really appreciate how different English sounds are from French
The frequent use of the letter "z" and of the tréma ï as well as the overall lack of vowels make it look decidedly un-French
Southern France (Marseille); true, I forgot that the way we pronounce our "o" sounds is different than most francophones
Another reason for "Djaune" rather than "djonne" is that, at first, I wrote the sentence using french words whenever possible (ouais, euh, tout, goth for "forgot"), before changing my mind
Jaune survived the changes I made
Freedom of expression and islamism
It's a tough subjects because 5M french are muslim

That’s a great post OP, with informative answers
Mods, how about making this a semi-regular thread that allows us to hear about and discuss trending topics in fellow European countries ?
Of course I know that it's been a week that they're shitposting us on twitter and they're hacking our websites
Of course Erdogan jumped on that to criticize Macron
He also encourage turks to boycott french products
Thank you for this comment, because got to be honest the way this is escalating I feel like France position is more and more isolated and I'm quite disappointed by the involment of other EU members and EU by it self
Don't know if it's because they don't support those values, don't understand how those are important to us, or just overall don't give fuck because "hey what are values when money is at stack ?".
Don't know if EU realise how sensible this subject is for the french but not taking a firm position behind us on this one will damage durably french trust in EU
Until now I was pretty certain France would shift right inevitably, but adding this I'm more and more afraid we might skip that and go strait to nationalist with Frexit etc
and this will be the start of a whole new kind of mess
I actually thought everyone heard of it when I posted it
Otherwise I would've put more details
It's not about calm but for a month the country was united and that's kinda rare
No indeed Erdogan encouraged the boycott
In Qatar it's a company that first banned french products in its stores
I don't know for the other countries but I think they just complained about what Macron said
Either Polytechnique (nicknamed l'X) for their engineering programs or Ecole Normale Superieure (nicknamed Normal sup) fir their liberal arts programs
As someone who lives close to Andorra and has been there multiple times
Yeah Andorra is the very definition of uninteresting
EDIT : typo
Luxembourg, Netherlands, the Baltics, Ukraine, Belarus, the first ones that pop into my head
Edit: Adding North Macedonia to that list
I always kinda forget that Lithuania is there, Estonia got Talinn, which somehow became a tech hub in the region, Latvia got the fastest wifi in the world apparently, but Lithuania ? What’s in there ? Is it worth visiting ? What makes it special ?
Moldova is probably the only country I know nothing about in Europe
I mean, I know the flag, but
What languages are spoken
What is the capital city
How many people live there
When was the last time someone mentioned Moldova in the news
I don't know, I felt Luxembourg had nothing of this
It randomly became a country for historical reasons, but couldn't find the associated culture
>The fries
Ah yes the French Fries from Belgium
Pretty surprised by Netherlands too, as Amsterdam is an extremely popular destination
I love Maastricht also, but it's true some cities have a poor reputation, like Rotterdam
Even then you can skii on the French side (I don't know about the Spanish one)
For me on the French side it's simply more convenient (and perhaps even cheaper) to go to La Jonquera instead of going up there for liquor and cigarettes
40 minutes from Andorra la Viella or Pas de la Case/Casa ?
So does Spain and you don't have to go through mountain passes that are 2km high to go there
> If you're into beer, there's the smorgasbord of beer types, brands and flavors
Real talk: yes,; Belgium has the most diverse "traditional" beer culture, but it's 2020 and Belgian breweries are still super orthodox
As sad as it sounds, I think the US has way more beer styles, and consequently way more flavours
That's not a diss on Belgian beer though, that's what I grew up on
The triples are marvellous and Orval remains a favourite of mine, but it's not super varied
The football team
Good potential, but lack some panache
No trophies, no finals, no big matches (the win against Brazil was cool, but Brazil is just not the same anymore), I hope they'll really make an impression next cup
Scheiß Luxembourgeois toi-même d'abord
We couldn't really find a typical restaurant (that was 10-15 years ago), the center promoted restaurants from other countries in Europe to give an European feeling, but it felt like tourist traps to us
We tried to find something unique, but not so much luck
It could be we didn't go to the right part of town, I usually find something good quite easily
Hahaha stop taking the piss out of them
I like their team, but the loss against Wales in 2016 was a huge let-down and 2018 was just fine
Now, they are still first in ranking but look harmless
The nations league wasn't better
I hope for them they do something good next time, but it's possible they have missed their chance
I don't remember having so many problems finding something local in the hundreds of cities I have visited
City centers normally try to promote ''authentic'' stuff from there, in Luxembourg it was more advertising itself as a capital of Europe
And Luxemburg is just a small city of 100k inhabitants, not some kind of megalopolis where you cannot go through a large part of the city in a 1h walk
The first time I heard "Help yourself," I misinterpreted it as "You're on your own
Do you mean süß or niedlich
Because I definitely agree for niedlich, but I think for süß it's more context-dependent and it's def used to compliment women
"fuck" would be really gross when translated in french (by our standards
For such exclamation we would use "merde" (shit) or "putain con" (whore cunt) in the south
Which word is tolerable or harsh may vary from one language to another
But we use more and more english and the young generation adpots "fuck" a lot (en anglais dans le texte)
I think here it's more that some french people think "Fuck" is by default the short version of "fuck you". I've seen this happen with kids and adults who  can't speak English
Aaah I might have heard it mostly to describe a behavior actually, never appearance
I live in Bavaria btw
Yeah not just in Liège or even Belgium . I am from Lille and I always use « Merde » to wish good luck , I’ve also heard French people from the South or even Paris using it that way
Thanks, you too :) Let’s stay safe
I think germans haven’t been too bad at isolating for now compared to the French at least
Politicians are mainly corrupt here
But I would not Say I experienced corruption, because you can't corrupt a civil agent, a policeman, anyone working for the gouvernement
Only powerful people are corrupt in France
I think France is alright and corruption isn't a major issue right now
There is some, of course, but not enough to be considered a huge problem plagging the country . There is many pressions and influences from lobbies, however
When cops took my friend's weed they didn't fine him, they just took it to smoke it themselves
[We all know who we have to thank]
In term of classic music, I like :
-[Debussy - Clair de lune]
-[Erik Satie - Gymnopédies]
-[Camille Saint-Saëns - Aquarium] because disney
-[Camille Saint-Saëns - danse macabre] (strat the video at 4m10s and wait for it)
-[Yann tiersen - Summer 78]
I also enjoy :
-[Opa tsupa - les 2 guitares]
As much as I adore those songs I still think one of the most beautiful songs to come out of France has to be [la bohème ]
Oh wow, I’d never heard that before (but then I am Jewish and live under a rock) but it’s just gorgeous and their voices are beautiful
I love their clothes
I assume that’s the native dress
Is it common to see people dressed like this anymore
What kind of occasions is it worn for
Jacqueline du Pré is such an incredible cellist
I live in Lyon
I only talk to the neighbor living on the same floor as me, I don’t really know the name of anyone else in my building
I wake up everyday at 6:20, leave for work at 7:30 to take the subway to work, I clock in at 8:00 and I come back home between 5:30 and 6:00 pm
I mostly don’t talk to people in the street except if there is a specific reason like to complain with others strangers about our bus being late or things like that (complaining really brings people together in France) or if someone is lost and need information
I have a few friends in the city and we meet somewhat regularly to have drinks, play board games (we have board game bars) or play role playing game at home
Life is alright, I like having everything close by and the public transportation are mostly quite good so going anywhere rarely takes more than 30 minutes
I like going to the countryside to hike and whatnot but I would not like to live there
My grandmother lived in a very small village and I disliked the fact that everyone knows about your every action and gets involved in things that are your business
People in cities generally don’t care who you are, what you are up to or what you are doing as long as it does not concern them which I like
I live in Paris and have lived in Marseille, so I’ve only ever lived in larger cities (except for holidays)
It’s nice and all, but I guess I don’t really know what it’s like living elsewhere
My flat is something like 20mins to the Eiffel Tower, in central Paris (the 15e is a big neighborhood, but it’s also one of the places in Paris where you can be close to the center of town for relatively ok rent)
I have easy access to pretty much all the town, what with the subway, and with time I know where to go when I’m looking for a movie theater, theater, concert, cheap booze, good bier, museum, Japanese food, beautiful/calm/animated places, etc
Lots of my friends live in Paris & its suburbs, aka it’s rather easy to see one another
I know some of my neighbors, but most of them are strangers that I see once a year for the "neighbors party" (that’s a thing here)
We say hello when we meet, sometimes discuss a bit, but nothing more
The ones I know, though, we invite each other over
Don’t really know what to say
Good schools
That’s important: big city <=> good schools, in France (same goes for high school, uni, etc)
Very pretty, very safe, clean, good public transports
Lots of nature in the city and even more outside of it (but easily accessible)
A pretty good variety of restaurants and very good food
A bit expensive, but still doable
Not the most intense nightlife but that’s not a priority for me tbh
Amazing university environment, great for research with good accessibility to libraries etc
Great weather and very cyclable (flat and great cycling infrastructure)
Pretty nice people, but it’s not that easy to make friends
Good culture, plenty of museums and things to do all year long), same for general entertainment
Pretty much the perfect city for me tbh
Big enough that I still discover new things, streets, sights; but doesn’t feel overwhelming
I love it here
I was born in Paris and well it sucks, it's dangerous as hell, it's absolutely dirty, it's full of tourists and it's fucking expensive
Countryside and smaller cities >>>> Paris clearly
Des bisous de Valence, la ville qui se voudrait être Lyon mais qu'en a clairement pas les moyens x)
I just visited vienna, and holy shit i wanna live there
Its so well balance between a dynamic town with good infrastructure, and a chill place where you can have fun and relax
I wish they made Paris like that (i dont live there but its the biggest city, so it has potential), cleaning the big monuments and the pollution would make it such a great city
Il faut vous convertir à l’évangile selon Saint Bocuse, c’est votre seule chance de salut
I clock in and out so the later I arrive, the later I have to leave work and I hate getting back home at 19:00 more than I hate waking up at 6:20
Pour rien au monde j'abandonne les ravioles contres des quenelles
On se respecte un minimum à Valence quand même
I mean, it's pretty much a reality already for the Western part of the EU
We only need to expand it Eastward
Can’t agree more
I had the same idea and so did others here, I think it would be awesome
Thought I’m afraid I won’t be alive to see it fully complete, if it ever happen
>Architects and engineers should take inspiration from Japan and South Korea, where the high speed networks look super nice, clean and ultra-modern
I mean the South Korean train is a complete copy of the French one and was built by a French company so I don't see how they could inspirate us
That's my utopian dream as well :)
Well the two towers might be a good idea, but I’m not so sure about everything that goes with them
Otherwise a railway across Europe is a really good idea
That’s the first one I thought of
It already partly exists
It's called [eurovelo] Some routes are completed, like the 15th one, along the Rhine, along which I rode with some friends 2 years ago
I'm veeery excited about this, though some countries are slower than others in developing this project
It exists
It's the [eurovelo] network
Only a few routes are completed (15th and 6th I think, more more since then) but it's very exciting
I would build the dam all around England and fill it with the Baltic sea
Thank you
Can't believe how far down I had to scroll for that one
How long would that take ? A long train ride accross Eurasia sounds like a nice journey
We already have such a rail network here in France but there is one main cons : it's expensive to build and maintain
I can be built with EU fond, it's not really a problem if the politics have the will to, but then each lines operates at a loss and the train company's debt rise up to billion of euros
Because High speed train is an expensive technologie, it's difficult to fill a Paris-Lyon TGV (the only profitable line here) with a 80 to 120 euros ticket
A solution could be lower taxes or public subsidy
I completely agree with you, but what could prevent our politicians to agree about a project like this is its long-term economic viability
> more taxes on gas
Well, look up "yellow vest" on google and see what's going to happen lmao
While it's true that cars are used often when train would be better, many people, leaving in small cities/countryside, dont have munch money to begin with and have no choice but to use gas cars rn
Pretty sure the Creuse doesn't exists, its name literally means "Hollow"
In France there's Trifouillis-lès-Oies that really doesn't exist but we regularly talk about it or send people there
The existing alternative would be Plougastel-Daoulas, a small Breton village that serves the same purpose
Legend says even birds don't travel here
Sorry to ruin the joke and the contract but the whole Metal world fully knows that Finland is the center of the universe
For France everybody knows Louis
but we also have : Clovis, Clodomir, Thierry, Thibert, Thibaut, Childebert, Clotaire, Caribert, Sigebert, Chilpéric, Gontran, Dagobert, Pépin, Carloman, Charles, Eudes, Robert, Raoult, Lothaire, Henri, Hugues, Philippe, Jean, François
No women ever sit on the throne of France, so women names aren't avaible
Okay consider France the illegal abortion clinic then
You forgot Charlemagne ! And Louis-Philippe
Clodomir and Thierry
I love old French royal names
I’m sure you could use the names of the regents for women’s names, and local ones such as Anne de Bretagne
do not forget about louis-phillipe
Some left better memories than others, if Süleyman I left a good legacy, we can't tell the same about Abdülhamid II
If you count Seldjoukid rulers you have Tughrul, Malik,  Barkyaruq, Mahmud too
Pépin, Robert, Hugues, Louis-Philippe, Napoleon
The merovingians had many
interesting names, but I can't name them from memory
&#x200B;
No girls allowed
And Louis-Napoléon
It comes from Hlod (glorious) mir (great) in old frank
But yes it sound like old slavic name like Vladimir
Actually no, there were 4 reigning Clovis before the reign of Louis Ist (in 814)
So even if Louis is a late form of Clovis, both are treated as different names, otherwise it would have been Louis Vth and not Louis Ist
Because of that, it is pertinent to treat them as different names
I guess that half of those names were traditionnal among old germanic people and must exist in modern german
Well Charlemagne isn't a name, it is Charles le magne (Carolus Magnus) Charles le grand
He is count with the Charles actually
And concerning Louis-Philippe it is surely a name but it is a compound name and we already gave those names individually
Thierry is still used through
I'm still waiting to encounter someone called Clodomir or Childebert, this would be unbelievable
Here you go,  It comes from Hlod (glorious) mir (great) in old frank (close to Clovis= Hlodwig in old frank)
But yes it sound like old slavic name like Vladimir
More than that
It's between Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists
Yeah sure i don't challenge the fact that this name may be used for evocation
But those are in fact treated differently, so this is why i treated them differently
In France, Dora the explorer teaches little kids English
Are there shows that were changed as such to fit your country's market
Où est Chipeur ? Est-ce qu'il est derrière la porte ? Ou bien sous le bureau ?
In the 90's, French tv imported A LOT of Japanese cartoons, and would change all the names and locations
Apparently not
"Latino" usually refers to people from central/south america with a mix of European and native American ancestry (well it's mainly a cultural thing built around identifying as part of that population, of course)
A Spanish colleague of mine, from Madrid, spent some time in the US
He once checked "hispanic" on some admin forms, and got a WTF reaction from the clerk
On another occasion a Mexican restaurant worker congratulated him on his Spanish :)
Oh, miiiiiiiiiiince
Team mayonnaise
Same thing in Belgium with the two main pilsener beer brands: Jupiler and Maes
But everyone agrees that both are widely inferior to the real Belgian beers
Over, and cheese on top, the ham isn't soft enough on butt cheeks
Funnily enough it's masculine in french ( le Nutella, du Nutella )
I live in Brussels and Stella seems to be quite unpopular here
It's always Jupiler or Maes
However it's kind of my favourite between the three
I think it's really refreshing
Comparing France to the USA, we’re small
Joking, the thing is this is true for France but it’s also something I’ve seen in lots of little countries that is not that true for big: centralization
The fact that one big city has such importance, compared to all the others
Iceland, for example: I think something like 2/3 of the population lives in the capital
Why do the dutch have an obsession with the fact that their country is small
Besides calling a country small is relative, Kazakhstan is small compared to Russia but it's huge compared to Croatia
I love 3 (and 4, but I’m not sure I should laugh about that one quite as much as I did)
>pretty much identify as French
Wow really
Very surprising
It is but you don't see other (even smaller) countries go on about how small their country is
I lived in the NL, talking to many Dutch people and there's really something going on
Thanks, it's nice to have a real answer, I'm sorry to say Dutch people get easily offended when you criticize their country, I didn't want to talk about this "inferiority complex" first but I very much believe it's a thing
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Glouton : Wolverine, literally "gluttonish"
Bernard l'hermite : Hermit crab, for some reason "Bernard the hermit"
I don't think we have especially famous song , but we have David guetta and Daft punk
we have Anissa from Wejdene, everyone was talking about how bad it is, making jokes, memes etc, nobody knows why but it became famous in the way that it has a lot of listening and it's at the radio
Meanwhile in France :
SAPÉ COMME JAMAIS, SAPÉ COMME JAMAIS !!!!!
> O-Zone - Dragostea din Tei
Dammmit Dammit, F*! i turned suddenly gay after watching that clip
People keep asking me What do the fox say as my in-game name is CowsGoMooMoo in Ow, never understood why
Terrible sound by the way, horrible i hate myself to listening to it twice
Dude
[Tomber la chemise] !
Also, that one about sardines
And Djadja, and Sur ma route, all that
No, Stromae is belgian
Oh yeah, this one is awsome
Except for the sardines,  not really
We're talking about cult summer songs
Think world Cup 98
I swear despacito and the sardines had the same effect on me: I never listened to it, yet I know it by heart and can’t stand the slightest sound of it
I don’t really think despacito (OP’s example) can compare to World Cup 98, it’s a “tube de l’été” more than anything
You don't have to apologize it's ok :D
Oh ok, I can understand that
Have a good day ! :)
Funny because we got the same problem in France with the EPR of Flamanville
The Vatry airport
They decided that to make the region of Champagne (the one where champagne is produced and there are more fields than people) more attractive by building an airport
Didn't really work as the airport is in the middle of nowhere, and Paris is like 2 hours away by car and 1 hour and a half by train
Also the Flamanville nuclear power plant
It exists since 1987 (Flamanville 1), then they built Flamanville 2, and in 2001 they started to build Flamanville 3
But it's been years and years, the construction still isn't finished (it's supposed to be finished in 2023) and it's costing a LOT of money
There's also been other problems, like the people nearby refusing to live near a nuclear power plant, or technical issues
The Notre-Dame-des-Landes airport near Nantes
They launched the project in 1963, Macron cancelled it in 2018
To make it short  : a lot people were against it (farmers, environmentalists etc)
They rioted and started to occupy illegaly the field in 2009
There were quite a few clashes with law enforcement
During Hollande's presidency, tensions grew for the Prime minister at that time was the former mayor of Nantes and supported the project
They organised a local referendum and 55% of the voters said they were for the airport's construction
In the end, the referendum was useless and people were still protesting and occupying the field until Macron cancelled it
You build thing faster when you don't care about the health of the worker weird right
The source of the problem is that all the four EPR construction projects to be build in France (Flamanville), Finland (Olkiluoto) and the UK (Hinkley Point C) are managed by EDF SA and its subsidiaries :)
Well it bring less jobs and money than if it was activated but it wasn't a complete waste of money
It ofc is but comparing it to china Is special lmfao
Since weeks, no pasta, no rice, no eggs, no canned food, etc
I live in Lyon and for now I have had no problem finding what I want
I haven't noticed it personally but I attended a Carrefour meeting and there indeed has been a huge impact on their stocks for essential products in hypermarchés all over France
I don't know if this will get seen but I wager that people are stockpiling toilet paper & water bc
they're cheap
It's not like people can stockpile gold etc .
Do you live where the virus is spreading hard perhaps ? Here in Auvergne I have not seen any difference in supermarkets
Really ? Haven't noticed shortages here (Yvelines)
Weird, I didn't notice any change in Lyon
Yeah
My local Waitrose, no toilet paper to be seen, yet the shelves are full of food and drink
People are fucking crazy; you can't eat toilet rolls (well, I suppose you could
The media should aknowledge their responsibility in this kind of situation but obviously they will never leave a chance for a spicy headline ...
Strasbourg supermarkets are stocked as usual
Île-de-France
No information about a big cluster here but shelves are empty since only 12 cases was announced for whole France
I have only seen pasta gone in Auvergne so far
I'm really glad they keep things closed on Sundays
I don't want to see our entire culture devolved into BUY THINGS even more
No issues in the North either
All normal in Paris too, surprisingly enough
Bordeaux, it's pretty normal but no hand sanitizer at all
I like Écureuil ( Squirrel ), the way it sounds and the way it is written make it a cute word
*Dépaysement*
It's the opposite of homesickness
The surprisingly pleasant feeling you can feel abroad or anywhere out of your usual personal comfort
*Affriolant* is more polite synonym of sexy
I like it
However in french it is the name of a laundry detergent, kinda ruins it
I directly thought of this one
"I'm going on an adventure !"
English is full of those, I really like the word "chop" for the exact same reason
Any too-american sounding name like Kevin, Brandon, Kimberley or Britney is a big :/
Fanny in France is a pretty popular girls name
Needless to say they get weird looks when they say their names in the UK
In France there was this trend in the 90s (especially in the most popular families) to call children American names because of popular tw shows and it didn't age well at all
Also the name Kevin is kind of the epitome of the stupid brat kid's name
Robert, Gontran, Monique, Thérèse
They're not awful but they sound quite old fashioned
However, genuinely bad named are some that used to trend in the 90s/2000s: Kévin, Ryan
Kevin,is just a bad name to give
I recently learnt that Chantal was a trashy name for kids in Germany and it feels weird because in France it's a quite common name among \~60-year-old women
Same for Jacqueline although they might be a little bit older
Jacqueline is an old women’s name in France
Several friends of my grandma used to be named Jacqueline
Exactly like,, children named Kimberley automatically are labelled as dumb
But honestly, can even imagine a Doctor Kimberley Dupont or a sergent general Brandon Lemoulin
Theres a super famous youtuber in france who is chinese and his name is kevin tran lmao
It’s only trashy if you are not from an English speaking country
Here in France trashy people often name their kids after their favorite soap opera, as a result American or Americanized names are trashy because when people hear that you are named Brandon and are from French parents they generally assume your parents were white trash
Think about a western weebo giving his child a Japanese name, would be totally fine there but in the west not so much
Exactly !! Every name that end in ey is a france recipe for disaster
Like that one girl in my middle school whose name was kimberley prononced it kim beurrr lééé (that french e sound you know the one)
It was dramatic
Exactly
Kevin is a teen with a cracked voice and Brandon cares a bit too much about motocyrcles and hitting his mom
No theyre just american/english names
The weirdness comes more from the fact that they are old names (both had their peak of popularity before 1960 and are rarely given nowadays), whereas in Germany the'yre given to kids
It's like if you learnt that Heinrich or Margarete were trashy names for children in another country :)
Yes I agree ! Just wanted to point out that it was quite an old name
Jordan ffs
So true
In the case of France it is generally right next to a Johnny Halliday sticker
Oh my bad
I read your comment as "are they native
" As in, are these name native american ? Sorry you meant naive haha
Yes, these names are associated with naive/dumb people in France
Edit : I just saw your edit
Welp sorry for that
What is your Country's Greatest invention
In general, maybe the metric system
In the realm of the military, maybe smokeless powder
Beyond the realm of science I’d say enlightenment and nationalism
[Most of these ]
In the French curriculum  we are thaught that the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg marks the historical start of the Renaissance, so I guess it is indeed a pretty big game changer
Wait, isn't the lightning rod Benjamin Franklin
I would also say the first telecommunications network, that got france a huge advantage during the revolution wars
Also wasn't one of the first vaccine french ?
The self contained breathing apparatus for diving was also invented by a French (first thing that came to my mind, don't know why)
La carte à puce ainsi que les boîtes de conserves sont des inventions françaises
Reinforced concrete, too
It’s used all over the world, and it was a French’s idea & doing
Not sure About that last one being "Great" but the rest pass
De Gaulle invented it, wrote a book about it which inspired Guderian
Problem was that De Gaulle wasn't listened to by those in command of the French army
Yeah, modern vaccines are a french invention
Louis Pasteur for the win
What is considered as the first vaccine is the smallpox one by Edward Jenner, an Englishman I believe
So no
Pasteur wasn't first there, not by a long shot
The name even comes from there, as they used a variant of the disease that infects cows ("variole vaccine" or just "vaccine")
Correct
The Lumière brothers
AND photography
Captain Cousteau invented it
That one might be the greatest
That'd be my pick for Portugal, it was an insane game changer in human history
Where did i say he was french ????
the semaphore line [
Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that you are a dutch, speaking to a french, on reddit, congratulating his (well our) nation, without even complaining about the stupid "they stole our flag" meme
Thank you, I love you
* Esperanto as an administrative lingua franca
* Common tax laws/system for companies
* Convergence of regulations
Plus, that could/would be a big step towards environmental policies
Where can't people do that
Yeah it'd make sense to have an unified rail system on the continent, but I don't see why island nations should comply
why
It's just a matter of taxing alcohol, isn't it
Imagine drinking wine at a party
I mean there's drinking and there's *drinking*.
But
but
that's not possible you can't drink wine like it was vodka
As far as I know there is no other word than collaborator (collaborateur, often shortened to just collabo)
Nowadays I see it mostly used as tech corporate-speak for coworker, which is rather weird to me (the full version
The shortened one is definitely only for nazi collaborators)
My grandparents were teens or younger during the occupation and both them and my parents would only use this word derogatively when I was a child
In France the word "collabo" is still very derogatory, but unfortunately it's now also used by fascists to refer to white people defending minorities
In France, collaborators is an insult, and the gestapo is associated with police harassment
Collabo is still absolutely an insult though
I was thinking "fascho"
Giving away Jews and résistants qualifies as collaboration
Yes
Not the most violent word, but it can really be the harshest of insult even
Well for people over 30 yo anyway
As u/locnlol explained, "collabo" is 100% understood as "a French who was on the Nazis side".
Well calling someone a petainiste would not really be well received generally but it’s not really commonly used as an insult
Pétainiste, but it's not widely used, it's mostly a term used for historical purpose
Absolutely
0 doubt about the meaning of this word
As an example, this word can be heard in Inglourious Basterds in this scene: [
Yes I think calling someone a facho is more common than collabo, but facho is more vague while collabo is really about ww2
I'm going to talk about a classic video game from the 90s:
«Another World» by Eric Chahi
All done by one single person (graphics and programing) on Commodore Amiga hardware and software
Games from Arkane Studios : Dishonored 1 & 2, Prêt
Games from Quantic Dream : Heavy Rain, Beyond: two souls, Detroit: Become Human
Also: rayman legends, Beyond good and evil
Ubisoft is a french company but I can't say what games exactly were developed in France, can someone help plz
Before Another World, he worked on "Future Wars" by Delphine Software, which was a famous point & click adventure game
Infogrammes, créateur de jeux français incroyables
Jokes asides, Valiant hearts: memory of the great war is a very good game about WW1
The Daedalic games are awesome
Another user mentionned the Gothic series, and there is also its successor, the Risen series (a bit of wasted potential this one)
Also, the **Spellforce** games were among my favorites in the early 2000
Hands down the best game I ever played
And I've been gaming since the late 80s.
It's one of the best game of last year, if not the greatest
Ubisoft is French tho
Fun fact : there's absolutely no proof about the « viking funeral » having ever existed among Norse people
The only testimony we know of is about Volga Rus, generations after they've established on the river
There are tons of tombs on land, though
But that's less tabloid-friendly
It was good but season 3 got too confusing
And simultaneously explained obvious things like if we were completely dumb
You'll have a bunch of people, you have no idea how they got there or why, except for one because it's very obvious who he is
and then the only explanation you get is someone mentioning that [very obvious character] is actually [character name]
Like if it was a big reveal
Thanks, but I needed help to understand absolutely everything in that scene, except that
So bad balancing of explanation that made it hard to watch
But great show for the first two seasons
I watched it earlier this year
I liked it in the begining, but the further it went, the worst it gets IMO
Like, not only they took a hard kind of scenario involving time traveling, but they also added more and more until becomming too much for the suspension of credibility IMO
But the musics are so good and the actors are good IMO
I was a bit disappointed by Barbarians
It's still a good watch but ultimately I was left with a feeling that the story was botched and oversimplified, leading to a climax battle who was at best confusing and commonplace
It's especially disappointing when next to that they did an amazing job with sets and props to get the right atmosphere
Belgium : thank you for the humor, the comic strips and the music
Without you, good francophone music would be inexistant nowadays
And thank you for being that neighbor that’s almost like us but much cooler
Spain : thank you for cheap cigs (also applies to Belgium)
Switzerland : thank you for offering high paying jobs near the frontier
And also thanks for the fancy ski stations
Luxembourg : thanks for the tax paradise (also applies to Switzerland)
And for giving a place for young french wolf of Wall Street to train
Germany : thank you for the cars and the autobahn to enjoy said cars
Italy : thank you for offering the second best food and wine in the world
England : thank you for the millennia of wars, alliances, betrayals, joys, hope and blood
Was a fun time having you as our best enemy
EDIT : also a huge thanks to Belgium for the beers
I want to thank Germany for being able to build a strong relationship with us even after a complicated past
And Spain cuz you guys are cool neighbours and I love your country
Thanks luxembourg for the jobs
But not thanks for the racism against french people
Thank you Belgium for the beers, the *bande-dessinées* and the humor
I would like to thanks the German for finally accepting that Alsace-Lorraine is french and stopped waging wars against us to take it back
wasn't Hitler Austrian
You aren’t really ment to be here any more, are you, brits
Nuclear energy is safe tho
And it pollutes very little
The German Coal plants close to Aachen are polluting the air of Belgium much more and are probably responsible for quite a lot of pulmonary disease among Belgians
Our nuclear power plants don't do such things
[Relevant to your last phrase]
"England is my city"
Norwegians go to Sweden for cheap alcohol, Swedish go to Denmark, Danes go to Germany, Germans go to Poland
Poles go to
I'm interested in how
Don't know much about our involvment in the post-WWII decisions
By the way and on topic, I thank Germany for the amazing beer, and the music
Sorry
collateral damage
On les aime, au fond, ces connards de rosbifs <3
I didn't tried to buy Champagne in Sweden but when I was there all alcohols were really expensive
We made some reserve on the ferry from Denmark
Depending where you buy it but Champagne can be pretty cheap in France, maybe not in Paris tho
Or maybe it's because you acted like an ass with us, with your dislike from the start
It sure didn't help
Je suis désolé. I've been too harsh
Breizh Cola, the coke of britanny, you will find it everywhere in France now, pretty popular with Britons diaspora ;)
Par Toutatis !
Bro i was i young but i was really curious what was that beverage 'cuppa' of yours but then i lost all interest when i found out i was just tea but it had to be served in a bloody cup
Available in Alsace too
I (from Lorraine) personnaly find it a quite strange taste
Don't you guys also have Frugo ? I remember drinking some when I was 6 or something and it was the most amazing drink I'v drank

We're not talking about the subtitles but the video titles
It only happens on some videos (I don't know how they're chosen though) so probably a lot of users have never seen it
>title being translated is alien to me
You get it
You can talk about Petain, it’s not super taboo and we don’t mind talking about it
It’s even a common subject for dark humour
We sometimes make jokes about Vichy France but this isn't something we are proud of
Interesting
Can you talk more about the two Spains ? Is it like a culture war between the Francoists/Traditionalists and the secular/leftists ?
Yeah, it's quite common to say that one's grandpa was a *collabo* during the war, just as a joke
There were plenty of fascist movements throughout the world, but the Nazis were really something else, you can't really compare the two
Fascist Italy is more akin to the dictatorships we see today than to Nazi Germany
Does the right still view themselves as the heirs of Franco ?
Some of my older family members still think we did more good than harm by building them infrastructure
Heck, even if the independence movement in Algeria was pretty radical and committed atrocities
They still don't acknowledge that we were very torture happy in Algeria
(edit: And I would argue that as a powerful country and occupant, we probably did way more horrible things that I don't know about)
It moves very slowly here in france when it comes to our history of being a major colonial power AND considering the *free government* (Petin so after we surrendered, not De Gaulle in London) not France
We basically helped the Nazis with their extermination of jews and we barely talked about it during history class
Depends on the game, usually english but if I'm playing a complex game (like grand strategy games etc) for the first time I'd rather have french and switch to english later
It depends
Sometimes I pick the language depending on the quality of the voice acting and translation, sometimes I just choose the language I think fits better the mood of a game
It's a bit of a mess really
I've played Mass Effect in French, Kingdom Come in English, the Witcher in Polish
It depends
Most games are better in English but for instance, I prefer The Last of Us and Bloodborne in french
it depends, i usually tests both but we have great French versioning so i usually keep the French version
In my language
Because I am playing Katawa shojo and it is nice to me to be able to understand what's happening as much as possible and the translation is good
But if I have to play a game with voices in it I think I would prefer to let the voice in the original version and the subtitles in my language or english if my language is not available
I prefer playing in English if it's the original language or if the English translations are better quality which is most often the case
I like puzzle games and got stuck countless times due to having crucial hints badly translated
I don't remember a specific example since I've switched to English years ago
It's so much easier to play
English, because video game localization is literally my job
AMA
On occasion, I'll play in French to see what's being done right now in the field, but too often it'll detract me because I'll pay more attention to the localization and try to guess what the original text was, instead of just playing the game
Besides that, I know the industry and it's exceedingly rare to find a translation that it better than the original
It can happen, but rarely over an entire game
And I prefer to see what the writers intended instead, since I can understand it
Always in french, unless it's a multiplayer game like League of Legends where you might need to used the same terms as everyone to communicate
French if available and it's almost always the case
I don't see the difference honestly, it's professional voice actors in both case
Few games have a broken translation so English for those
Well it depends of how good the dub is in French
These late years they have become much better and the dubbing of video games got  professional
The Witcher 3  is a good example of a perfect French dub
Dare I say that Geralt's voice is much better in French than English
French most of the time
Translating characters’ voices, names of places, objects, etc
don’t denature a game in my opinion
(It certainly does denature a movie however)
honestly out of every game i’ve played, i’ve only been disappointed by the versioning twice, and in France we have a lot of great voice actors
I used to think that too, and when the first Mass Effect came out on pc I played it in french and replayed a second time in english
Since then I play every games in english
The countryside represents a huge territory in France, but it really depends from where you're from
There are very urbanized regions like Île-de-France, Alsace or Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur (mainly the South) and very rural ones like Limousin, Guiana, Centre or Lorraine etc
I'd say that people from the countryside and from most cities kinda hate Paris, that's a point that we all have in common
And Parisians are often seen as assholes that are never happy and that shit on the countryside, but they don't have 200m^2 houses with gardens, they don't know their postman nor almost everyone in their city, they don't have deserted roads without any traffic jam, and they produce 0% of the French agriculture so they might be jealous towards us, but that's all I think
Most rurals like where they live and are proud of this, including me
There's no such big conflict between rural and non rural in my country
France has one of the most populated and "developed" countryside in Europe and I think this is the reason why
The only thing would maybe be that rural people see non rural as very non-manual (they need to hire and pay someone to repair or change the smallest thing in their house)
And also Parisians being jerks but Paris is a very different topic
Yes, it's more "Paris vs
The rest of France" than "cities vs
countryside".
Cities aren't rural areas
Confusing "la province" with the countryside is exactly what Parisians do
Pas besoin d'habiter dans la cambrousse pour maudire les pourritures parisiennes
True
I don't think there's an actual rural / non rural fight since most of the population lives in the countryside
It's mostly about Paris / vs the rest
Do you think Lyon, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nice, Nantes, etc
are "the countryside" or "rural"? Paris isn't the only city in the country
Un allié !
AFAIK a very large majority of the French population is urban
Et vous trouvez ça normal de parler des gens comme ça en plus
Bande de cons
You're right, I didn't mean in term of numbers
What I mean that France has a certain part of it's population living in small villages
In fact, there are more villages in our country than any other country has in Europe
But still, more people are urban of course
C'est pas moi qui suis en train de traiter les gens de bande de cons il me semble
Yes
I’m ashamed of my poor German (and someday I’d like to go back to learning Russian)
It depends more on your hobbies, in my hobbies I come across a lot of japanese and sometimes spanish so that makes me want to learn these languages
On my way to learn japanese and fuck it's hard
Good luck, you’re entering a beautiful nonsense place
I don't think it's not "enough" because I don't need to speak more languages, but I'm a bit ashamed I only speak 1 foreign language properly (english)
I learnt spanish and Mandarin at school but can't remember much
I would love, just for pleasure, to learn Turkish and Russian, 2 languages I love the sound, especially the first one, plus I love their culture
And maybe Arabic and Korean too
I live in France and can speak almost all neighboring languages : english, italian and spanish, so I guess I'll feel more complete when I'll learn german
>but once you know kana and ~150 kanji it gets way better
I already noticed that a bit, only started like 4 months ago but with something like 70-80 kanjis in my mind I can already notice patterns, same kanjis repeating all the time just combined with other ones to make different meanings etc, it already got a bit easier, it's just a lot of information to process
But I know I have a long way to go, can't wait to be comfortable enough with japanese in general so that I don't need to try and "decompose" every sentence I see to make out where a word starts and where it ends
I can assure you it is
C’est peut-être le fait d’en parler déjà une, ce qui rend les autres assez similaires
Mais je sous-entendais surtout atteindre le niveau de langue où les seules erreurs que l’on fait sont involontaires
Absolutely not
We would need snow in the first place
This is the first time I've ever seen that in my life
But I live in Southern France so it's not really surprising lol
It's now or never, try it
Il neige chez moi
Very few places in (metropolitan) France where it *never* snows though
Thank you, I was actually going to ask how it was made
Temps are starting to freeze here and will for about a month, I have to try this
Where I am from (Marseille) we may have one day of snow every 5 years or so, and it usually melts the very same day
But you can't generalise that to the whole country
AZF factory near Toulouse, chemical factory, 300t of ammonium nitrate exploded in 2001
31 deaths, 2500 wounded
My great-grandmother was Ukrainian
Well no comment
AZF is the most recent comparison, but there is actually a much closer one, the Ocean Liberty (as in liberty ship) explosion that occured in the Brest harbour in 1947
That was over 3000t of ammonium nitrate
I think AZF was closer to the city center than Beirut's harbour was fortunately
One of the things I am the most ashamed of
Italy: we love you unconditionally, even if some of you insist that we are terrible
We will just love you even more for it
Just like a grumpy cat
Germany: glad you are our new best pals for the foreseeable future, hopefully it will remain this way if one day Merkel gives her office to someone else
It sure beats bayoneting each other by the millions every twenty years or so
England: sorry you were not on board for the EU project as much as we were
Brexit just sounds a bit like a bad breakup and I hate people who say « I hope we can stay friends » but I do hope we can stay friends
Scotland: sucks you got taken in for the Brexit ride, you guys are awesome and I love that you guys still remember The Auld Alliance while so many of us (but not all) forgot it
Belgium: I love you crazy fuckers, you are like a crazy scientist’s experiment that somehow functions but no one has a clue why
Hands down the best beer in the world too, there is just no competition because they all went to sleep after two Chimays
The Red Devils are always my backup team in big competitions even if I know Les Bleus would never be yours, even if they somehow found a way to cure cancer
Romania: I don’t know why but I always root for you and wish you the best
Sorry for the ignorant people who think you are all living in caravans and stealing copper wiring off building sites, they are stupid people who never left their city
Romanian people I met always were cool as hell
Poland and Czechoslovakia: sorry for the WW2 unpleasantness
Our government of the time was dealing with its own shit and had a mix of incompetent and cowardly people at the helm
As Churchill said to Chamberlain after the Munich agreements: « You had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose dishonor and you will get war ».
Dear Belgium,
We love you
You're actually better than us, and deep down we acknowledge it
I wish we cut out the stupid accent imitation which is so rude and uncalled for
I hope that slowly we're getting there
Thank you for the comic books, the chocolates, and the enlighting concept of going on without a gouvernement
Dear Scotland and Ireland,
We would be able to understand you
Please don't dumb down your accent to plain English
Your accent is super cool
We're just not that good in English so oftentimes we're don't know how something is called in English rather than being troubled by your accents
Maybe speak a bit slowly if you feel that you've lost us
Don't give up on us
We can do it
Dear Netherlands,
Sorry for calling you Holland
We're working on it, I swear
I'm sad that History somehow stucked us appart, because I feel than we have more in common than we think
Dear Germany,
I'm always amazed how far you travel
I've been to remote place of the world and I've always met German people there
You know a lot and keep learning humbly
I always learned a lot of things from you guys and loved our philosophical political talks and imaging a better world
You set some good examples to us to follow and we're glad we're over that batshit crazy feud we had
I'm proud of us two, how we managed to u-turn from hissing at each other to complete respect and friendship
Dear Spain,
Thank you for living slow
Yes, really
I feel like we should slow down too
Dear everyone,
Contrary to popular belief, we do not think we're better than other people
We're not that competitive and cultures can't be ranked to begin with
We've been at the highest high and the lowest low in the course of our history and right now we're just trying to carry on with our shit
I love Italy and Italians but unfortunately, I can't really be there at the moment
Auld alliance for ever mate
No offense taken little England
Dear Netherlands,
Thank you for setting the gold standard for bike infrastructure in modern urbanism,  You basically made biking cool again
Also the deltawerken made me proud to be european
Finally I have not idea why you like camping so much, but it's always nice to speak with y'all when you're in south France
Indeed for Italy, we love you unconditionally !
I was about to add "Dear Italy, everything is pardoned for 2006; eventhough it took 12 years and you not qualifying to play a world cup
I'm almost sorry it took so long
I guess we sometimes know how to hold a grudge
I would say we only have a real "mutual rivalry" with the UK
I almost never hear French people say negative things about Italy, Spain or Portugal
As far as Germany is concerned, my teachers have always insisted on the "special franco-german friendship" and I've always had respect for german people however I know it's not the case for every French people
Also yes, I agree, the surrender jokes aren't funny
It's not hurtful, it's just unoriginal and boring
Every time people (especially American people) make a surrender joke, I cringe
I live quite close to the border between Italy and France and I don't think I've ever heard French people "hating" on Italy
Except maybe for football matches, (but I think that actually a lot of French football supporters love to watch the Italian championship) and a little bit of critics of your politicians (don't worry, ours are as bad as yours lol) and food
Teasing England ? Hell yeah
Teasing Belgium ? Hell yeah
Germany ? A little bit
Spain and Italy ? No, not really
It's definitiveky not seen as "mutual rivalry" here
In fact I think French people love both Italy and Spain, mainly for the weather, cheaper items, holidays and good food lol
So it's a one-sided love then ? :( Lmao
>France: give back Lorraine
You can't eat a quiche and have it
Thanks u/joelherman the thread is so interesting
We used our quota for you already
The dutch, danes and norwegians too
Germany contractually can't. Spain wouldn't like the weather
I dunno try Poland ?
Damn you made me crave for a nice Gewurtzaminer
You are, we will love you like a grumpy cat that insists he does not love you back
French people expecting Belgian people to cheer for Les Bleus are not sane or they never went to Belgium
I grew up in Picardy so I had lots of occasions to visit and I am realistic about what to expect
If you ask the average French person about Italy, the first thing they will say is that it's a beautiful country, that the food is fantastic and that they would love to go there
Now, if you ask them to compare Italy with France, then yes, some may say things like "France has more varied landscapes" but you can hardly consider this as "hating on Italy".
Also keep in mind that French redditors are not representative of the general French population
Never heard the French have much beef with other latin countries in general though, let alone Italy in particular
It's genuinely the first time I hear this and those points that french people apparently made make no sense to me
I'm really sorry you've met French people who talked badly about Italy
Aside from the 2006 final issue among hot-headed soccer fans (who are a minority) who have since moved on, I haven't met anyone who would diss Italy
>Also france has still some debts with us so some resentment is right (not to the single people, but conceptually
Debt for which of our many wrong deeds
Thanks man
Appreciate it
We get salty about it because the 20yo soldiers to be in '39 would have had to be born during WWI and that couldn't have happened
We also provided planned parenthood tools, so that the poor could get out of poverty trap and got unfairly punished for that social choice while Germany pushed for bigger families
And we were just outnumbered in WWII, there were no way it would be enough
half of the country
let's not exaggerate, it is estimated that about 5% of the population was actively involved in the war, either resisting or collaborating .
This does not take away from the fact that the jokes about surrender are stupid
> but often french redditors say “i love italy but it’s only pasta and pizza, you have less coastline mountain sea or whatever than us, you are less varied than us”
You seem real salty about that, wanna talk about it
It's only the 3rd time you're saying it in this thread :')
I mean, French romanticism right
Tbf, I never saw an Italian complain about the joke before, while whenever you have a surrender joke, you have a french guy who'll say it's lame
I'm probably biased but I think that in terms of landscapes and climate, France is extremely diverse
I don't know why you call  plainland monotone
Some of the most beautiful French regions are plainland (imo)
jeuxvideo
com is widely known as a cesspool, do yourself a favor and don't go there
It's like a French 4chan without the NSFW pictures
Never saw hate toward italians on French youtube
It probably exists because there are always retards but I never saw it and it is not a common sentiment that I can observe in real life among the population
if there is one thing I see myself not drinking it is milk (and pastis but that is for another time), I really don't like the taste at all
But I love anything made out of milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt
Not me at least
I strongky dislike milk, I use soy or hazelnut milk instead
Disgusting
I drink milk everyday, but I don't like it raw, only with cereals OR chocolate; but the best milk is when it have transformed into cheese <3
You've only tried UHT milk, right ? For a very long time I found milk nasty
Even with chocolate, I hated it
After trying fresh milk from a local farm, I found out I actually hate UHT taste
Try whole microfiltered milk if you haven't. It tastes sweet, nothing like burnt cheese UHT
Regular liquid milk that's been sterilized : disgusting
Raw milk that got solid because of the bacterias and molds in it : absolutely delicious !
I'm exagerating but that's how i feel about it
I don't really like the taste of liquid milk but I'll eat the strongest and smelliest cheese with great pleasure
Absolutely hate drinking milk
Ahh cool noice !
Well at least in france I have some Cheese bars ! :)
I'm from the country land and yeah I've tasted it but I don't have a lot of memmories about it as it was maybe 15 years ago but I'll try maybe someday
Are you my greek alter ego
See me on r/eatingcheesetwiceaday
I've always heard "à Tataouïne". For a long time I thought Tataouïne doesn't exist but it's actually a city in Tunisia
Trifouilly-les-Oies is a (fictional) caricatural, random and boring rural french village lost in the middle of nowhere
We also often use Bab-el-Oued, a district of Algiers, to designate something very far away location
Triffouillis-les-Oies or Perpète-les-Oies, Pétaouchnok,   Au diable Vauvert (old school), Bab-el-Oued (north african)
Vauvert (Gard) and Bab-el-Oued (Algeria) are actual places
« À pétaouchnok » a fictional city approximately located in Russia for somewhere very far away
« Perpète-lès-oies » for a village in the middle of nowhere
Tombouctou, and we have another one which was made up to sound vaguely Russian: "Pétaouchnok"
Some imaginary, very remote Russian or Ukrainian village called «Petaouchnok». The expression dates back to the mid-19th century, around the time of the Crimean war
we say that in french too
it's "au cul du monde" (more like butt of the world, but the feel is similar)
Il y a aussi le trou du cul du monde non ?
"Perpette-les-olivettes" ou "Perpette-les-oies" sont plus courants en Provence, et "chaille" en Rhônes-Alpes
Sinon il y a aussi "Pétaouchnok", je sais pas si c'est local
Bab El Oued also exists in French
I always heard "le trou du cul du monde" -the ass of the world
>where dogs bark with their asses
By far my favourite
Pas faux mais moins utilisé quand même
Chaille
où plus précisément, car je suis de Rhone Alpes et jamais entedu
On dit aussi (Lyon) Perpette les oies mais pas les olivettes  et on dit aussi Pétaouchnok
En effet on entend perpette et perpette-les-oies par contre chaille j'ai vraiment jamais entendu
J'ai grandi dans l'Ain et je suis à Lyon
Petaouchnok et Perpette-les-oies sont assez courants chez moi en Gironde
J'ai déjà entendu aussi le beau combo entre Perpette-les-oies et Tatatouine : Tataouine-les-oies
Tataouine-les-bains aussi
Because Star Wars is rather recent
Fun fact: the scenes of Tatooine were shot in Tunisia
Jamais entendu à Tataouine
Trou du cul du monde très souvent par contre
Je viens aussi de Rhône-Alpes et je confirme qu'on dit bien "à chaïlle" voir même "à chaïlle les oies". Viens de Valence, je sais pas où c'est dit d'autre en Rhône-Alpes
Ça fait partie du vocabulaire de mes cousins ardéchois et mon de chéri isérois
C'est peut-être juste le "Sud Rhône-Alpes" alors (Ardèche, Drôme et Isère)
Oui j'ai remarqué que c'est très régional y'a pas mal de truc que j'avais vraiment jamais entendu de ma vie
Ca doit être un truc du sud de la région, comme "ça pegue", une amie ardéchoise le disait nous jamais
It's rough and it gets everywhere
Wait I just noticed this
Anakin is from Tatooine right ? How the fuck does he hates sand ? It would be like an Inuit hating snow
Ça pegue c'est même encore bien plus au sud je crois ! On l'utilise dans ma famille mais je crois que même pour la Drôme c'est rare
> Basically it's now forbidden to leave the country
Most governments have a law that allows to shut down the borders in some situations like this one so I suppose it is
I do blame them, countless government bodies telling people not to hoard stuff, that it's not necessary and that it will ultimately hurt the system and medical professionals
They're acting selfish, no one needs 56 rolls of toilet paper - are they planning on having diarrhea for 3 weeks straight ?
I think the difference was in expectactions
France was considered the main country able to oppose Germany with UK
I don't doubt Denmark implication or professionalism but if you compare their numbers and economy with Germany's at the start of the war, no one would have really bet on you from the get go
People had a lot of hope for France to be able to at least severely damage Germany and we let everyone down and that's the actual reason why we get that much flack

There are business district but just not in the historic center
I think you can't build higher than the Eiffel Tower in France
In Lyon a lot of skyscrapers are under construction and were planned for the 2020 decade but we elected a ecologist mayor and he wants to cancel all those projects
It leaves only Paris and La Défense building skyscrapers
Most of cities have instaured laws against building skyscrapers to preserve the landscape, the originality and authencity of the cities since some have over 1000 years old buildings
Hence most of skyscrapers are located out of the city (such as Paris as you mentioned)
NB : several cities have a construction height limit based on the height of the main cathedral (such as Strasbourg where the cathedral is and will stay the highest building)
By the way, don't you think that with telecommuting being more widespread because of Covid, that kind of buildings would be less and less necessary
There are 2 now in Marseille (the [CMA-CGM tower] and the [La Marseillaise tower] and many are stiil against them but at least they are not generic buildings
Still, the previous majority (right) on the city council wanted to create a whole lot of them, to create a sort of business district
The new majority (left) will most probably halt that for a while
"Prêt ou pas, me voilà!"
Nous aussi mais uniquement quand on joue à cache cache
J'avais compris de manière générale
Makes me smile when hearing people from Québec or the Antilles
The advantage of French is that it's pretty standardized so there is little differences between countries
There is the accent though which can take (a very short) time to adapt to, with far away countries (in America, in Africa)
However some french speaking region can have other dialects based on french but other than french, like joual in Quebec or creole in the isles and it would be hard to directly understand all of it
I personnaly love the different accents and vocabulary  from other countries
By using different words and idioms, you can figure out that people think differently and add more importance to statements/ are more sensible to an aspect of their culture
For example the Quebecois (French canada) use religious words for swearing because their relation to the church is completely different from France
Another example is that in South east Asia, elder people (the last ones to speak French unfortunately) are always talking about  animals  when it comes to describe something ("he ran as fast as a horse", "you need need the strength of a cow to move this barrel", "these players are coordinated as a wolves group" etc etc)
Please keep talking with your own words
It is always refreshing and sharing cultures and ideas is thus easier and more interesting
Diversity is the key
Québécois has a little charm
I don't mind if people were to use it, it's just that nobody would understand
Same apply to every other, I don't see why people wouldn't like other people using a different vocabulary
> I feel like they differences with Australia/NZ etc are pretty minimal IMO
Really ? I have no problem understanding brits but I once spoke with an aussie and didn't understand half of what he was saying
It was probably a question of accent rather than vocabulary though
Australians use primarily American English, at least in Western Australia (where I live)
Apartment, truck, etc
Oh, they do use chips for both chips and crisps, so they are a bit confused sometimes

We're not vocal when we're happy, Macron as still 25% of the population with him
And the president is saw as the symbol of the state and the governement so every mistakes or bad decision is put on him

Who was it that said "The French are people who live in heaven but think they are in hell" or something like that
Being unsatisfied with how things are can be healthy if it drives you to betterment
We overdo it though
Would say our neighbors underdo it too
I'm French and I can't stand the complaining either
No, but I’d be interested in learning about it
Willing to share
Please
In France it's a legal obligation to dub a movie on television
Englishmen after the SF: ["it was all irony
Nobody in the country ever believed we could do it"]
Seems like something that could have been a good idea but was not
Interesting, though, thanks for sharing
For example: Tippex, Nutella, Sopalin (paper towels, actually it's *SO*ciété de *PA*pier *LIN*ge, which translates to company of paper towels), frigo and stuff
I don't know a lot of them in french, but I'm sure that we've got "Sopalin" from the brand, Sopalin, it's the paper towels
Edit: We've got alos the Tipp-ex but it can be called "Blanco" and the Post-it
Ah good old Tippex !
We use it too
Y'a aussi Scotch (tape)
Abribus too
It's a JCDecaux brand
It's actually called an aubette
There's also Tupperware for the plastic boxes
I've also commonly heard Mir or Paic to refer to any brand of dish soap
IL y a aussi "Un caddie" qui est une marque de chariot, et pas un chariot en lui même
J'ai appris dans ce thread via d'autre gens que Jaccuzi est une marque et pas le nom d'un SPA
Aja ça merci
Yes it should be company
Yes sorry got confused with the word
Yeah that's a trick, because in french company is "société"
In French, a kite is called a "cerf-volant" which can be translated to a "flying deer". It came from the word "serp-volante" where "serpe" is the old word for snake
As the word "serpe" disappeared, it became "cerf" because it sounds similar
The word for dragon is dragon
Nope
Kite = cerf-volant (flying deer)
Dragon = dragon
It is "serpent" which indeed comes from "serpens"
In Spain, a US citizen talking to a clerk in French, who wouldn't understand anything of course
When I asked her why she would do that, she told me that since Spanish and French were latin languages, he should be able to understand
Take photos in front of a gravestone
Tourists crossing the Place de l’Etoile in Paris (the road that circles the Arc de Triomphe)
I know that we, as French, are not known to be the most keen on using crossings, but dude, when you see a whole bunch of cars trying to make their way around this huge monument, you just don’t cross
Seems basic, but I see tourists do the opposite on a daily basis
I've been to Auschwitz this year and I've seen so many people taking selfies in front of the *Arbeit macht frei* gate, it genuinely shocked me
That's in the Invalides right
Cool museums there
Ah, you made an honest mistake though, don't sweat it
Difficult not to do so in some cemeteries
Take Recoleta in Buenos Aires or the Père Lachaise in Paris
Those have very photogenic gravestones
Maybe he was gathering some textures to add them later in a 3D environment, for video game/architectural/advertising purposes
But it's quite specific
I'm sure it was under a shared agreement with your interlocutor
I understand Italian well enough, but if someone started to randomly talk to me in Italian outside of Italy without notice I would be very confused
As was this Spanish clerk being spoken to in French in his own country
I speak 3 but if you start to speak to me in italian, I will look at you madly confused and not understand you
They never tried English while I was here, so we will never know
When it’s a recent gravestone
I mean people are still suffering from their loss they do not need dumb people taking photos of such an intimate place, even it’s in the Père Lachaise
I find it gross, and disrespectful
I live in a small village where an ex celebrity (Gregory Lemarchal) is buried
His parents lives in my village, goes to his grave but are constantly disturbed by fans taking photos of their DECEASED son’s gravestone
You wanna grieve ? Do it decently
Mourn him if you want but don’t take ekcing photos
I think it's spelled geyser in English, the I and capital G would indicate that it's about the specific site in Iceland :)
Yes, it's call "la province" and it sound  a bit derogatory, so now the PC term is "les territoires". People of Paris have the stereotype of being smug asshole that look at the rest of the country with despising eyes
even Lyon and Marseilles (around 2 000 000 hab in the metro area) is part of the province
Every time a Parisian uses the word "province" a rat gives birth in Paris
I would also mention the [*diagonale du vide*] (diagonal of emptiness), which refers to the low-density population stretching from the Landes in the southwest to the Meuse in the northeast
it's generally count as Paris
I once went to Paris (I'm from Lyon), the guy at the hotel yeld "which room for to provinciaux
" to his collegue, provinciaux was said in a very  contemptuous way
Most of them thinks we all live in a hunt without wifi or even a museum around\^\^
To Parisians, it's the "banlieue" or even "provinciaux" (I live in Seine-et-Marne, which is mostly fields and forests outside of the urbanized areas), to the rest of France, they are Parisians
As someone who lives there, it's annoying
I certainly don't consider myself Parisian
Paris and its close suburbs are very much different from here in the way you live and the way it looks, no matter how close it is
Parisians look down on us as the dirty "banlieusards" who come pollute Paris with cars and sully their perfect clean city, and when I go in vacation elsewhere in France, I get called Parisian
Getting smugged by everyone be fun
No it counts as "la banlieue" (the suburbs)
A different category in itself
I can confirm that people live here
Oui alors, quand même pas hein, et heureusement !
_We do not actually think that, which is good because it would be an awful cliché to believe in_
Ouais enfin t'es surtout tombé sur un bon connard hein, il ne faut pas oublier qu'une bonne partie des gens habitants en IDF sont d'anciens provinciaux, donc pas du genre à juger ceux qui y habitent encore
"Adieu tous ces gens prétentieux dans la capitale
Qu'essaient de prouver qu'ils valent mieux que toi chaque fois qu'ils te parlent
Tous ces connards dans la pub, dans la finance

Ces parisiens, jamais content, médisants
Faussement cultivés, à peine intelligent
Ces répliquants qui pensent avoir le monopole du bon goût

When I was still a little kid I went to Québec and was surprised to find French speakers outside of France, outside of Europe
First I went to London when I was a child, I remember that me and my family went to a McDonald's and the cashier started speaking to us in French
That's when I learnt about the amount of French people in London
I’m sorry you had to hear this
I can’t imagine talking in such a mean way of anyone whether they understand me or not
Why wouldn’t you simply says « when that woman moves ». Some people are just rotten
Why'd you get punished to give your opinion on something
Isn't it what school was made for, to develop a critical mind in order to differentiate what you like/agree with from what you don't?
Yeah but it's not even a language thing
I would never think to design someone as 'the fat old chick'. Maybe at worst "the one with the weird hair", or the big teeth, or any distinctive feature like this; but idk, I'd feel like an asshole even just saying what he said you know
Like I feel like my friends would (rightfully) judge me if I said it to them
You just encountered the meanest German tourists in Indonesia
Ah thanks for the correction
And I'm glad you enjoyed Malaysia :)
I think you are too nice to defend them
They were rude, it is not the end of the world, but still
But that you defend them still shows that you have the better character
As a French girl studying in London, I would always stand out from British girls when going out at night because I was the only one whose belly button was not showing
People in uni dress a lot more casually than in my high school
Nobody is dressing like us
It's subjective but I feel like we're putting more attention on what we wear than other europeans
Actually, German people wear more camping clothes all the time (we used to joke about Jack Wolfskin being the most popular cloth shop in Germany) and are less formal in the office than in France
I won't say there's a huge difference, maybe more for women
Although German people do dress up for important occasion, and we (I used to work in Germany) were often surprised by Dutch in conferences that would still wear jeans, sometimes a t-shirt and no jacket or ties
We do but it's not very hard to be honest
Nobody will look weirdly at you because of what you're wearing, except in Paris or if you're wearing really strange clothes
Remember : I can go to another country, buy a house, get a job and have free health care
My wife has been in France for over a decade as a German citizen
No questions asked
None
My brother, a French guy, lived in Belgium but went to the university in the Netherlands
He crossed the border every morning and every night, probably had an ID with him
I don’t even think so, he just crossed a bridge and there were no customs or anything
He did have his ID with him when he came back home (to France) because he’d take the Thalys then and, you know, terrorists attacks
I did the same when I came to see him, but it never got checked -guess I was lucky
Also, in terms of school trips, through the years I went to: Italy (twice), England, Belgium, Luxembourg and I _think_ the Netherlands
In terms of friends & family trips, much more than that (Italy, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands
No need for passport inside Schengen area (UE+Switzerland+Norway+Island)
For people living not far from a border it
is extremely casual
People living in north of France casually for buy their smokes in Belgium or Andorra because it’s less expensive
Depends how far from the border you live
I know people who go to Spain or Germany monthly to buy booze and cigarettes because the prices in France are ridiculous, but they live less than 50km away
Otherwise it would be quite useless and a waste of gas
I haven't been outside the country in a decade
My grand parent often go to belgium (we live in northern France) , like that , because some stuff are less expensive
Going back in france from uruguay via a stop in madrid was the best feeling ever when the queue for EU citizens was empty and I passed the checks instantely in front of angry uruguayans who were waiting at the foreigner's queue
People go to Germany shopping, lots of stuff is cheaper there
I lived close to a border for some time
At least 3 times a month I went to a neighboring country
Some of my friends/acquaintances commuted daily to a neighboring country
I usually go to Belgium once a week for tobacco
My wife's niece's boyfriend works in Belgium, and goes there just about every day
Same with the Lille metropolis
People living in the North go to Andorra
For a Best Of Big Mac
I live in Tourcoing and used to go to Belgium like every week, mostly to buy cheaper cigarettes
Also my tattoo artist is in Belgium
On the other hands, many belgians come to France to do their groceries
Yes, the passport makes it a lot easier to be recognized as a citizen of aforementioned country (official document) in another country
Every time I've showed an official document which was not a passport it made things more difficult however legal and legit it was : when I showed my official French ID card IN California they had never seen one, when I showed my California driver's license in France they weren't sure what to do with it
The rules vary from country to country e.g. in France not many people know a driver's license is technically not a valid ID
Cultures vary within countires too - Switzerland is actually a great example
Not from Paris, but even as Frenchman, I can say that fuck driving anywhere in Paris or on the "Périphérique" if you're new to the city
I avoid driving there like the plague
I don't drive, but l'Etoile (which is what it's called) is notorious for being super scary for most people
It's kind of a test, like if you can cross it feeling safe, you have truly become a Parisian driver
Whether or not that's a good thing I'm not sure
Parisian here ! I can manage most of our traffic, Périphérique included, but I still avoid Etoile (where the Arc de Triomphe is) and Nation (its sister roundabout in a less touristy part)
I actually go around it through the side streets
Paris isn't the worst - I've been to Clermont-Ferrand on holidays last summer and the people would go all-out on narrow winding mountains roads ! And let's all agree to forget Corsica even exists :)
Not really, because I drive there every morning on a motorbike
The rule is to let people entering the square from the right (the avenues) when they have the green light
One gets used to it fairly quickly
Even bikes find their way through
The problem are the tourists who, for some reason, didn't realise there is a tunnel to get to the Arc
They walk their way to the center, which is extremely dangerous and very scary because vehciles drive fast when there's no traffic
I almost hit some teenagers once, they were running through the cars
Parisians have developped the unique ability not to give any fuck when it comes to driving
I, on the other hand, would rather take the train and pay more than to drive in Paris
Not a Parisian but I think the unspoken rule of driving in Paris is that you warn people of what you are going to do and then you just do it and it is the responsibility of the guy behind you to make sure they don’t collide with you
You only deal with what is in front of you basically
It just takes assertiveness basically
If you hesitate you are going to have a bad time
It's a rite of passage
Fuck driving a car in Paris, as far I'm concerned
As a Parisian, I just don't drive, and most of the ones I know (meaning born and having always lived in Paris or in the close suburbs) usually don't get a licence before they are around 30 or even older
But yeah, the Arc de Triomphe is one of my worst driving nightmare (along with the corsican roads, as an other redditor pointed out
When driving on the Place de l’Etoile (the Arc de Triumph roundabout’s name), just picture yourself as a fish in a bench
Go with the flow and avoid people around you
It’s actually fairly easy when you act chill about it
Not really
I do it quite often on my bicycle, it isn't so scarry
Cars tend  to mind each other, so they drive slowly
There are some places more dangerous like the peripherique, (higway around paris), Nation, pote-Maillot
I don't drive, but going through the place de l'étoile on my bike is something I was glad to do exactly once and never again after that
As a French that lived near Paris for a long time, I can say that it takes two hours to go from Paris to Paris
So it is hell
Of course not, it's just a roundabout
Except when there's people on it, then yes, it's like a huge game of chicken
You have to be more alert than usual, with a rather calm temperament
A tips is to not take general annoyance personally
Parisian here, the trick is to only look forward and respect the right of way to those entering the circle
after that its all good !
Place de la Concorde is up there too
Yes, it is
I believe it would actually be illegal
By the way, I've heard the same claim about Italian insurances not covering Naples in their basic plans, is that also a myth ?
Yes it's a myth, can't be uninsured when driving anywhere, especially somewhere as accidents-prone as l'Etoile
In case of an incident on l'Etoile the fault is very often shared 50/50 as it is almost impossible to determine who did wrong, except if it's clear someone denied priority, the Etoile being about the only roundabout in France where people entering the roundabout have priority
It's a myth, but I just found an [article] with more info
Responsibility is shared 50/50 if both people were respecting the priorities of the intersection, otherwise they try to find who is at fault like with any incident
However I did learn that student drivers aren't allowed on it
Yes
Having a small scratched car is the best strategy in Paris imho, "I won't mind another scratch, would you
" works very well
Fucking hell these guys are absolutely insane, crossing this shit like it's India or something
Do they believe you gotta deserve your visit of the Arc by crossing the death trap first, that everyone did it that way ?
I can see that you didn't get the memo, German tanks are not allowed in Paris anymore
Marseille is next level shit on so many aspects
Yes la Concorde is hard, Porte Maillot too, crossing the Pont d'Iena (between Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower) as well, and I may forget a few
People who don't have kids like to drive motor bikes or scooters for a reason
There's nothing quite like being stuck behind a tractor in Corsica
No, not the only one
Any roundabout without the blue round "left priority" sign is a "right priority" crossroad, for a roundabout it means that people entering have priority
Most roundabouts have the blue sign but not all, especially in small towns
Please, remember that, or don't drive in my neighborhood
> the Etoile being the only roundabout in France were people entering the roundabout have priority
They are rare but it's not the only one no
I must admit the signs for the tunnel could be more visible, especially if you're not in Champs Elysées
But, yes, it's pretty obvious one shouldn't walk there
Oops translated directly from French without thinking
I meant a fish in a shoal
I'll just drive straight across the roundabout like I always do but thanks for the advice
I agree, yet more scratches means you're a veteran of some ugly battles
If you're attempting to cross this there are 3 options : traffic in your country is that insane that it seems normal to you, you're suicidal or you're an idiot
No really, that was a symbolic gesture, an only once in a lifetime thing, now keep YOUR tanks on YOUR side of the Maginot lines
>Any optimism that it might improve in future
Minus the bankrupt part in your case
Fougace
Doesn't matter, they'll avoid you all the same
Yet seeing yourself as a veteran duelist put you in the right mood for driving in Paris, feeling like a shitty driver doesn't
You can be the best driver and have other ppl dink your car while you are parked, it happens so much here
Yep, that's my excuse too
We have many loan-words from english like' week-end' for example
But the most surprising are usually the ones we took from german
We have integrated the word "Ersatz" which means substitute, to use with food items in sentences like 'un ersatz de café' (a subsitute for coffee)
This one probably comes from WW2 times, when Germany was occupying France and took the good ingredients (coffee, potatoes, etc
) for their troops while french ppl got the subsitutes (chicory, jerusalem artichoke, etc
Another anecdote i like to tell about loan words is the one from "to flirt". We integrated it in modern french language as flirter, but the english verb itself is a loan word ! It originates from the very outdated french expression 'conter fleurette' (literaly telling little flowers, means to seduce, or at least to try ! XD)
> ersatz
I never heard this word until now, I guess it's used in the North East near Germany
Bra is "soutien-gorge" in French, literally "Breast-support"; *gorge* means throat nowadays, but was used for breasts as well until the interwar period
As far as I know, italian words ending with a consonant are extremely rare
from what i found (quick search on wiktionary) 'conter fleurette' comes back from at least XVI century, and the use of 'flirt' in french was already existent around 1880
but eeh i aint no linguist so idk what's true or not now
Intuitively i read media the latin way so i had no idea what you were saying xD
no, it's used everywhere
I guess the occasions to use it are just rarer now
In France, the second most spoken language is Arabic
Research has shown that more than 2
2 million people can speak it out of a total population of 66 million
( Due to the immigration )
It might be Portuguese, the Portuguese are the largest minority in France
German or Spanish
In my region, it's probably italian tho
I thought it was German
I did french as my mother language
still know nothing about
I did Spanish as a second language for 5 years of my life, but I now know absolutely nothing
Oh true my bad I forgot about the title
Same thing over here, I have colleagues in their early 20s who don't know where to find a file in Windows, have never heard of CTRL-F for a searching in a text, CTRL-C for copy or CTRL-V for paste
Most of them don't even know you're not supposed to turn off the PC by pressing the power button
I blame Apple
lol

EDIT: I made a typo
I feel like when you know Napster you where a hacker and we had the first Debian redhat, the web 2
0, I learned php3 and was offered a great job we played alot with computers, now people are just lazy and want to edit videos to get mega bucks on YouTube you use a telephone they don't have the same chances that we had
For sure
I am a nurse, and sadly, we use computers a lot, everyday
I'd say 20% of our time at work, that we should spend with the patients instead
We use them for medical data, prescriptions, transmissions, and lots of administrative stuff that we have to do ourselves because of budget cuts
Sorry CTRL-V, typo
lol
Over here it’s everywhere
Feels like it’s barely regulated
Idk about other countries in Europe but here it’s super accessible even delivered n stuff
We're the first country in the EU when talking about joints
But in France weed is less popular than haschisch, the cannabis' resin
Which is worst than weed because you role the joint with tobacco and the resin is heavily cut with everything dealers can find
So that's that
But yeah, whether it's weed or hash, pretty popular
Edit: popular into younger generation, less when we're talking about 40 or 50 something
Its more popular in my highscool than tobacco
In my class, half the students smoke at least once a week
Weed is more like a trend among students and dealers are recognized
It’s easy to buy some and you often enough smell it in the streets, but it’s not everywhere either
Some places are known for outside smoking (bits of Montmartre, Les Halles in Paris
) whereas it’s pretty much unknown to others (to keep the example of Paris, you’ll pretty much never smell weed in the Invalides and the whole 7th arrondissement for example)
Also, the police doesn’t really care about smokers, but an arrested dealer faces real charges
Rennes is like weed city
I don't know where you live, but i'd say you are extremely over exagerating and giving missleading information
> We are among the first consumers in Europe
YES we finally bit you to something
Vogli fumare una canna ? (Don't judge I've tried my best)
Which country
I live in Grenoble and I don’t really know about Paris but over here dealers are rarely arrested
The idea is if they stop dealing drugs they’ll commit more harmful crimes like theft so they kinda let them do their thing
Yeah, Sainte Anne has a constant faint smell of weed almost
J’exagère pas à Grenoble c’est comme ça
Yes, that’s Montmartre for you
(Agreed it’s strange place for a smoke, but hey: the view is great)
Je pense que tu donnes la vision d'un enfant de 20 ans
Ça n'est pas la réalité des choses
Sono così stupido ! Oh imparato l'Italiano in lyceo, ma sono incapace di lo parlo corretamente !
Funny enough I live in Drôme which is just at the Alpes border, si you've never been so right !
Well, that's exactly what happened to me with my Italian
Still achieve to have 17/20 at my bac, but they do not seem to care a lot about our LV2
I just checked and it's a 2h drive from my town
But beware, do not mistake la Drôle Provençale and La Provence
They aren't the same region
La Provence is way more South
La Drôme Provençale is a part of Drôle that looks like Provence but isn't really a part of the region :D
I told you I couldn't speak Italian for shit
I am under the impression that they fool a lot of people
I'm happy you loved my département
Well you're almost my brother then
I visited Italy 3 times when I was younger
Really nice country
I miss it, I haven't been there for almost 7 years now
Please send me arancini al ragu
I miss them

Some parents absolutely want to be original so they just add a random amount of h or double consonants, so their kid has a "unique" name

Haha, didn't know Kevins had an international reputation, I thought it was only in France
Poor Kevins !
>Some parents absolutely want to be original so they just add a random amount of h or double consonants, so their kid has a "unique" name

You know, I took some Italian lessons at university à few years ago(actually, 10 years ago, damn), and it was probably easier to drop the pronouns for us than to add them for you guys
Btw, is the use of personal pronouns a common mistake among French people speaking italian
What's wrong with it
Good to know ! Now that I think of it, it was more pointed as uncommon than an actual mistake indeed
Thanks !
I don't know if that counts but I left France 5 yrs ago to live outside Europe
I am now living in South America
I believe it has been one of the best decisions, if not the best, of my life
I am from Southern France but moved to Paris a couple of years after graduating, because well, if you are a bit ambitious, you have so many more options in Paris
Well a lot of factors led me to take the decision to move abroad, but quality of life has been one big decision factor
In Paris, even though I was having a very decent job with a very decent pay, my daily life was miserable, with 1hrs30 to 2 hrs time in the terrible transportation system of Paris back and forth, the same public transportation workers who decide to go on strike for weeks if not for months about every year, making your life even more miserable, horribly expensive housing market, and a depressing weather, added to that a very stressful job, and I ended up doing a burn out
Today I live in a much nicer area compared to where I was living in Paris, my residence has indoor pool, sauna, open air barbecue, and a futbol 5 (micro football is how it is called internationally
) field
I go to work within 20 minutes, and even if my paycheck is lower, my spending power is way better
I could make several good friends so my social life also improved
Of course I miss France, the food, my friends and family, but for instance, safety wise, it is different but not worse, at least for me, even though I know I live in a country that is, on average, way more violent than France
The one thing that is absolutely true, your problems travel with you
Some people are moving abroad to try and get away from their own problems, this is a huge mistake
With the struggles to settle down in another place, your own issues feel even more acute
Yes, I am now living in Germany and very happy there
It is hard to envision coming back to live in France as it is so very centralized, and Paris is unlivable (incredibly crowded and expensive)
I don’t really know what the future holds for me
Moved to Ireland 2017 in order to find better prospects for my career
No regerts
Rents are crazy expensive in Dublin, so you might not have to live with your parents anymore but you might consider living with roommates
I had a really boring job when I first arrived
But it taught me a lot about corporate life and I made a ton of friends
After a while it allowed me to access a better position that required a higher degree of qualification and I really enjoyed it
Then I got a fairly high paying job in one of Dublin's tech company
I now realise that the money was maybe not worth it
As someone who lived on 600 euros intern compensation and unemployment checks, I was able to live comfortably even in the lowest paid job because I could manage my money
But don't focus too much on that
It's all about growing as a person, wonder about money and retirement pension when you're 25 or 30
Left France for the UK almost 5 years ago because of better job prospects
I'm lucky to have found a position in a solid, global company since as Brexit was voted 3 months after my arrival
I originally planned on going home after 3 years with more professional experience, but I've fallen in love and I'm about to marry a EU national who only speaks English and his native language, so unless we both manage to WFH full-time I don't see that happening before 15 years from now
I'm French, I love France but I always had issues with the overall mentality, my field was not really open to 'outsiders', I wanted to learn English, I flew to the UK to study a master degree
Although I must say I had 'good' student jobs when I was in France, it was easy for me to find waitressing jobs, and I supported myself during my studies
But other things (mostly social and the 'French mentality' that everyone accepts and justifies) made me want to leave, which I did
The first time was in the UK, I was a student, had a blast, learnt English, got my master, everything was fine and fun
Afterwards, I went back to France for around a year
I was still unsure that I was ready to leave everything behind, I had a job opportunity in Paris, and I spent a year there
Everything that I hate about France was 10 times worse
Sexism, normalisation of sexual abuses, etc etc, patronising co-workers, never feeling safe being alone, I was made fun of because I spoke English (not like random English words in all sentences, but I was dating an expat), and many others
I short, I was fairly unhappy
One 'incident' was my last straw
I found a job (took 3 weeks) and two weeks after the interview I was arriving in the Netherlands with my life packed in 2 suitcases
It's been more than 3 years, and I'm thriving here
My life conditions improved 10 times, I am surrounded by good people, the people are mostly super nice, I'm just happy to be here
And by no means I'm saying everything here is rainbow and unicorn
I struggled, a lot, and still am
Covid hit hard for me, I'm currently unemployed, it's not all perfect, but I love it
I do feel homesick, I miss my family, I have a couple of friends still in France, I miss the French social policies (health insurance, retirement funds, etc)
And you, as an Italian is going to miss something big: the food
To quote my old teacher 'how could she move to a country with such poor food and wine when she loves it so much'!
I think I also needed an escape from long terms issues, from toxic people surrounding me, but then what was the point of staying if I was starting 'fresh'. But all of that made me grow a lot, learn to know and love myself because when I arrived, I was alone, for quite some while, and I had to be okay with that
It can be lonely for some, although if you're planning and studying and working you'll meet people
I became much more comfortable meeting people, I forced myself to go outside my comfort zone
And now, I'm waiting for an answer from a job interview, I've found my partner, we're planning on buying our place in the upcoming years
I saw you are considering a PhD in the future, maybe check out the Netherlands, don't know your field but check it out here ;)
I'm french and I left my home country to go the UK 3 years ago to do a PhD
Now that I'm almost done, I'll be coming back home, but honestly, I kind of hope to move back away from france again after my postdoctoral contract
The salary are outrageously low for public researcher in France
No shit the researchers are leaving the country
Anyway, I'm freaking loving it in the uk
Although france is very prone to patting itself on the back for their universalism and secularism, they still cry like babies whenever they see a veil on tv
In the UK there are no such bullshit
I believe they are much more inclusive with a "you do you" kind of mentality
For what it's worth, I'm in Bristol, and it may be something that is very specific to the city, but I found it very welcoming and inclusive
I love the place
After Covid, when my situation will allow it, I'm moving to Italy
I left France in late 2009 for Vietnam then China, came back in 2015
I was in my late 20's, single, freshly out of university with no debt but no possession either
France seemed boring to me back then
Although the job market was not the best back then in Europe, my motivation was mostly a wish for change and adventure
It turned out to be a good move carrier-wise, and I got my fill of change and adventure for a lifetime
I like "boring" now
OP, this is the answer you're looking for
I was in a similar situation and Spanish/Italian population is certainly a thing
What do you love the most about France a French culture if I may ask
Because Latin culture is quite different from the Scandinavian one from what I've gathered here
> Smart, practical people
This is a blessing and a curse, though
Sometimes, and especially when you're young, you'll want a bit more "spirit" in your life than good old Protestant work ethic :p
What is it that you wanna do ? I've seen lots of Italians in Ireland and I find it surprising
In my opinion Italy is really not that bad
Everyone knows about the regional disparity but Milan and Turin have much more to offer than Dublin I think
Thank you good sir
Having a Burn out then
In Colombia
It is in my handle
Nowhere as much as in Dublin, and I'm saying this as a Mokumer
Thank you for speaking so well of my country and region
As always we take our ways of living for granted and do not realize  the bright sides
We French are especially good at seeing the negative aspects of our society
Wow, thank you very much for such a thorough answer
The "closeness" of Danes was what I was referring to when I said that our culture was different
Most Scandinavian on this sub describe it as following the norm and being quite withdrawn on themselves
I guess it might be a stereotype, but I feel like, as you described, we're more open on different paths in life
And one thing is sure is that most people don't really care about what other think of them
Your neighbour exemple was quite interesting, I didn't know it was a thing in Denmark, and once again as you said it's not something you'll find here
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you, but might I have you opinion on what you dislike in France on the other hand
Something you'd like to ameliorate
Because as another French said, we do take some things for granted, and it's always cool to have another pov
I checked & even the Vatican vicinity is not too bad lol
Dublin has become a major international hub for all sorts of business and I myself have to go there from time to time for work, but it just doesn't strike me as some place to settle down
Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's because it's growing too rapidly for the infrastructure to catch up
It takes time to expand cities organically like most existing metropolis
> it just doesn't strike me as some place to settle down
It's a farily unique city and I do think it's shit for the classic definition of "settling down", eg a suburban house with the wife and the dogs
However, Dublin has a gritty charm and a soul that I've yet to find elsewhere
Well, no, Paris has as much spirit as Dublin I think, only very differently
If you're annoyed by things not being nice or clean or neat, if you like things to run smoothly, Dublin is not great
But if you can look past that, there's a wealth of culture, fun and knowledge to be found there
Yes, but people do live outside of centrum, but within the ring
Dublin's housing issues extend well beyond D1/D2
>I don't think it'll surprise anyone when I say the slowness of anything bureaucratic or government related:)
Yep, just as expected, lmao
I have to send my RIB/IBAN for my future healthcare reimbursements by actual mail
I totally expected to upload a .pdf on some website but no, I have to use paper and mail it like it's 1973
Of course, I should've known
Yeah we're still an old country that is very *very* reluctant to change and improvement, especially digital-wise
Yes, I was going to say the downside of established metropolis, like Paris, is that old buildings are literally falling apart
Ireland has a great opportunity to build from the ground up and be modern
And of course the liveliness and energy
It feels different every time I visit
I haven't read the book, but the author made a ted talk that you can find on YouTube if I'm not mistaken
I lived in D1 and worked around Parnell, then on East Wall, after a year at UCD
So yeah I've seen the suburbs but it's not the most fascinating area of Dublin :p
I would not give too much credit to this ideal world of parenting, tbh
Regarding food, maybe there is something more or less true, you will find in France pretty elaborate baby food that really taste like real food
And if you look at typical pre school and primary school menus, you will understand that food is a lot more diverse and somewhat more healthy than in the US
Now, babies having full nights at the age of 4 months, sorry but no
Exceptions maybe, and then starting 6 or 8 months, you can start hoping to get 5 or maybe even 6 hrs of sleep
Otherwise, French parents are just struggling as much as US parents I guess, we may be a bit more strict in establishing rules and boundaries, but it is really a case by case basis
>Haha, I'm sorry I dont have something more original
Don't be sorry for saying something that's 100% true
As someone from the Côte d'Azur, glad you like it here
Oh there's an explanation for this one actually
It comes from WWII
As you must know France collaborated with Germany and gave *a lot* of jews during the war
We even gave more than what Germany asked
They mostly wanted men, and we gave them women and children
So the idea behind not having a register is simply: you can't find/give informations that might be dangerous in certain times and periods if said register simply does not exists
I'm not well versed on whether we had such a register during WWII or not, but you see how simple it would've been to find and send jews to camps with such register existing
I'm not explaining it too well and I'm sorry
But the idea is having such a register would have more flaws and bad sides than good ones
We also just aren't too keen on the idea of a centralised register of data overall
I can't explain it, but just thinking about such a thing makes me feel awkward
There's a whole big brother vibe to this
To be clear, I don't mind gritty, I actually enjoyed it very much
I'd much rather spend time in Smithfield (at least what it was 10 years ago) than in D4
Well, you can do DNA test from what I know
A lot of youtubers did when they went viral some years ago
I also thought about doing one and the websites were all available AND in French
As for the trust in the government, I think we've got some genuine concern seeing our history
I already talked about what the government did during WWII, but even today, they are trying their best to do whatever is best for them and their friends, and little for citizens
They don't take what we say and think into account
So it makes some sense that we're being wary of it
I'm not saying it should be this way in every country
Just that it is perfectly logical in a French context
I would love to be able to have such kind of register and stuff
But I do not believe in the "system is there to help them and to make their life easier". Because even if it was true, if it was created with such intent and purposes, there will always be a slight chance that one day someone decides to use it in a bad way
It is going to sound *really* pessimistic, but I'd rather never have such kind of infrastructure, because the downfall of such things could be abysmal
But I feel like such wariness from the government is a latine thing more than just a French one
I am under the impression that Spain, Italy and Portugal also don't trust and like their government too much
(Sorry Romania, I know you're always forgotten when people talk about roman countries, but I must admit that I don't know jack shit about your political landscape
Not that I'm an expert on the former three)
> It is a funny thing, Danish people are more closed off and like their personal space, but are fine with anyone being able to look up their address and phone number
French people are much more open and chatty but wouldn't want just anyone to get their phone number
I dont know how to explain that, but it is interesting
it is indeed very funny
I didn't thought about it, but it's quite the realisation actually
I don't really know what to say or think about that right now
But it seems like something to think about and consider about our relationship to government and politics
edit: for the last part, now that I think about for more than 5s it just makes sens to me
Those information are private ones
Of course nobody should have access to them
I can be chatty if I want, it doesn't mean I have to tell you those things
It just seems overly dangerous and a major breach of personal life and basic privacy to have those data available to just anybody
edit 2: When I say I'd love to have such registers I mean, I'd love to have such a trust into the government
The first edit made this assessment weird
Sorry
In French we have the adjective "ferroviaire" to things related to trains and railways (like "réseau ferroviaire", railway network)
Railway is "chemin de fer" and the actual train track is "voie ferrée".
Not really, even the most mountainous areas will have small towns and villages not that far away
I guess one would need to go overseas, to the Amazon forest in French Guiana, in a place with no native tribes, or on Clipperton Island, where you'd die without food or water in a matter of days
Not really, the population in rural areas is very much spread out and the landscape is either plains, forests or used for agriculture by inhabitants of a nearby village, even in the leadt densely populated areas
However, overseas departments and territories are probably very different, I wouldn't really know about that
I once heard that London can technically be classified as a forest, due to the ratio of trees/area
It's just a very populated forest then
It really depends on the country
Nicolas Sarkozy's father was born in Hungary, it was never brought up
Manuel Valls is born in Spain, it became a problem only when he decided to go there and start a short-lived political carrier
The mayor of Paris is from Spanish descent as well, it is brought up by the opposition from time to time but with no effect
Now if said politician was from some specific countries with which France has a more troublesome history,  it would definitely be brought up and would gain way more traction with the general public
I'm thinking a politician born in Algeria for example
We had french prime minister that was born in Spain I believe and all the reproaches had was about his way to do his job not really where he was born
So I would guess it shouldn't be a problem for a French President
It'd definitely be a bit controversial but I don't know how much, like, Sarkozy had one of his parents not born in France and it wasn't controversial at all, so I don't know
The former PM, Manuel Valls, has dual French and Spanish citizenship
For the most part it would not be a problem, in fact you'd be surprised by how many prominent politicians (especially socialists for some reason) were born in foreign countries
I disagree that Sarkozy's heritage never came up, but it wasn't used against him
Valls (former PM) did not acquire French citizenship until he turned 20, and Hidalgo (current mayor of Paris) at 14
They are good examples
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing was born in Coblence, Germany
I wasn’t born when he was President, but I’ve never heard anyone bring it up
So, we actually already had a President that was born in a foreign country and it never was a story to my knowledge
However this would probably be very different for a foreign-born or naturalised candidate
Remember Eva Joly’s candidacy
Yeah the reversible vest as we call it
Like would a French politician born in the UK be met with defiance, unlike one born in Spain for example ?
I mean if the guy is a French citizen, speaks French and demonstrated that he loves France over the UK, I don't see why not
That rivalry pretty much died out, except for sports
That would definitely not be a problem, nor would it be for any other European country
As it has been said, many of our political leaders were born abroad or are direct children of immigrants and it's never really been an issue
I had no idea, but tbf this case is a bit special
The mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo and former PM Manuel Valls were both born in Spain and nobody cares
True, true, I was wrong then
What newspapers in your country does the government fear ?
In France, for a century, a newspaper called "Le Canard Enchainé" (The Duck in Chains) has been known for releasing regularly news that shake the power to its core, sometimes leading to the downfall of politicians
François Fillon, that was supposed to lead the right wing to victory in 2017, lost in a pitiful way after it was revealed that he employed his wife at the parliament for years, while said wife never set foot in the building (it is one of many examples)
The newspaper relies on very solid sources, sometimes other politicians leaking an info that could weaken an opponent
Anyway, does your country count with such a media ?
Funny thing about this newspaper
It is released every Wednesday morning, but institutions, national agencies, and media groups can have it if they send someone at the newspaper office, between 5 and 6 PM on the Tuesday evening
That way, they have a twelve hour headstart on their PR response
If you pass by on the street, you can see a line of courriers and men in suits, waiting for the journal, praying to not be inside
Also "Canard" (Duck) is another word for:
- In old popular Parisian French, at the beginning of French journalism, someone who sells newspapers, and shouts to gain attention (GET THIS NEWSPAPER
ONLY X PRICE
They're called a duck because of the shouts
It then became a word to reference any bad journal/newspaper/etc (in Paris), any journal that are so-so
- In the late 19th century, it can also mean a fake news/gossip
So this a really amusing name for a newspaper known for their investigations
Mediapart in France too
Charlie Hebdo was kind of good too
Should have mentionned Mediapart as well
And security is impressive as well
There are always one or two gendarmes standing guard during the distribution
What's also quite interesting is that there are no ads in this newspaper : the cost of printing is quite low (8 pages each week most in B&W except for the first and last), the price hasn't gone up with the €, and the whole cost is covered by the subscription and sale
It's to ensure that the newspaper remains independent
Does media part has a printed version
To be fair they do work quite often hand in hand with le canard enchaîné
Was
It still exists
But they were never into news, only satire
Was it ever an objective for any Irish Gov to make irish the dominant language on the island or not so much ?
"In 1979, the newspaper reveals that President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was offered diamonds by the Central African dictator and emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa
"VGE" tries to defend itself, without much success
Two years later, he lost the presidential election to François Mitterrand
Granted this is an old case, but I would say this is considered as their biggest scoop
Mostly right wing, but I wouldn't say they make quarters
It's just that the left is rarely in power in France
No, i don't think so for the printed version
You can see here an article pointing out some differences :
Satire are often about currents events
So almost like news
Didn't understand anything but sounds cool
Absolutely,  he didn't get a free pass
We don't really have that
Scotland, because we both hate England
The US may be
We’ve been friends since the US is the US and we’ve always had each other’s back
Like De Gaulle said: "France doesn't have friends, just interests"
France and Germany are best friends since the end of WW2 I think
Much love from your neighbors
>we don’t have friends,we have interests
More or less a citation from De Gaulle
You would have liked him
Well Spain used to be ruled by our archrivals the Habsburgs, and then the Napoleon thing happened, we never were true allies like you and England were
It's either Scotland or the US
The term guerilla was invented by Spaniards fighting the French Empire
Plus, Habsurgs
Scotland is the traditional answer for us, but in reality it's more like the US, despite recent (freedom fries, Trump) events
We were pretty friendly with most of the peninsula throughout the Middle Ages, providing them with bored nobles looking for a bit of a scuffle (your very country being founded by one of those), but the Hapsburgs really spoiled the broth
We don't really care because you're our colony since 1066 tbh
Les Etats Unis ?? La bonne blague
Damn picky you are : )
Je dis pas ça de bon coeur, je les aime pas plus que toi
Not really but I have travelled a lot and I swear the U.S army sells merch
Mostly in asia, I have seen so many U.S navy shirts and shit in regular stores it's wild
Also, I live in SK right now and people usually have french phrases on their shirts, and I am pretty sure they don't actually know what is written on their shirts
Tons
And plenty more with meaningless *french* words on it
Yes, and I even own one or two shirts like this
My favourite one has a photo and captions related to an earthquake that happened in Japan
Good fun
I have a hoodie that has that, they're quite common and nobody cares it doesn't mean anything
It sets off a time bomb in me whenever I see someone wearing clothing that just says "FASHION". I have imploded 10000000 times now
Vivre, Rire, Baguette
Very crude and infantile in a lot of ways, and it lacks that dry (and often rather depressing) edge that you see in a lot of Northern European humor
Still, I don't mind it so much
I find it translates to (or perhaps is just more reflective of) a more direct and straightforward culture in France as a whole, which I find infinitely preferable to forced smiles, internal dissonance, and excessive overthinking about *every social interaction you ever have*. We just don't really have patience for anxiety-inducing nonsense like that
I'd say it depends
It's heavily reliant on wordplay and situational humour which can both be infantile or refined
IMO "Kaamelott" is a great example of what french humour is about
Because that is what you here about, especially for younger generation
There are a lot of other styles for one-man-shows
Best example would be Gustave Parking, who makes shows based a lot on poetry of the words, but that don't get much recognition
Fair enough, and I didn't mean to come across as dismissive or anything
Kaamelott is indeed a great example
My take should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, anyways - I'm certainly not the one amongst my friends known for cracking jokes
Maybe I should just move to Germany
Wordplays and situational humour, I agree 100% with that
That was my first thought
Most classic French humour are the likes of Louis de Funes or Les Nuls which are basically those notions, along with cultural references
There's also a weird layer of linguistic humour
Some phrases that are not funny in themselves but that said this way become funny either by the out of context language level or a sudden strategically placed insult
I'm thinking of Audiard's dialogues as a prime example of this but Kaamelott also does it to an extend
This reminds me of when Sarkozy was president and he gave a speech where he sounded and looked really drunk
Turns out he was completely sober, what happened was that he had a little « friendly » chitchat with Putin right before he got up on stage
Knowing that I actually think it’s impressive he didn’t piss his pants where he stood
Not a real nervous breakdown, but prime ministet Jean Castex was looking for his glasses for a solid minute
They were right under his nose, literally
A very funny moment
Pain au chocolat vs chocolatine, but it is getting old imo
[PARCE QUE C'EST NOTRE PROJET
[Le Pen trying to mock Macron but simply managing to look insane and ridiculize herself in public]
That's gotta be about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, in the semi-finals we played Belgium and they dominated the game but still lost
Some Belgian fans and players were pretty salty about it and yeah there are a lot of chances now that if you're getting salty in France someone will say "Ok Belgium" , "65% possession" or some stuff related to that
French people complaining about how much they complain in any conditions or governement and going into protest
The french railways society being ALWAYS late
Bryan iz in de kitcheun
- (since the last presidential elections) When Macron was campaining he yelled at one of his rallies "parce que c'est notre projet !" (because this is our project !) so loudly his voice broke, and now it's a meme and people will yell that sentence in a exaggerated manner everytime then can (anytime the word project is used basically)
- (for a very long time and still ongoing) North vs South war over the correct word to use for pastries (pain au chocolat or chocolatine)
I send students on exchange programmes to Universität Bielefeld and I chuckle everytime I see the name
It got old a year ago, but I think it's mostly an internet thing, isn't it
Normal people don't give a shit about this "debate".
[MAMMA MIA, Marcello ! That's not how you hold a pistol !]
Haha we have same "he was there at the creation of the Earth" joke for Valery Giscard D'Estaing, a former french president who is still very much alive today despite being already close to 50 when he got elected in 1974
The louder the better
I'd add OSS 117 and Kamelot for the internet crowd
> We should give independence to Catalonia, declare war and then surrender so they annex us and we are back United
Haha Spain playing 4D chess
Where is my umbrella

What she says is not really noteworthy honestly, it's more the whole attitude and her laughing like a maniac that is cringy as fuck
She just says "they are everywheeeere, in our citiiiies, in our countrysiiiiide".
I really like soviet jokes, they have that hint of self-mockery also found in jewish jokes told by Jewish
WTF, that's the official Conservatives channel
You guys are going full american mode
About 4/5th of the country call [this] a "pain au chocolat". The last fifth (the south west) call it "chocolatine".
There is a nice rivalry about this, however everyone knows the pain au chocolat is the true winner by a very large margin
Google is right :) It literally means "At the good bread", a kind of way to say "where the bread is good".
It's usually bought together, and would be classified as the same "type" of goods, however it's not the same cooking process and can't be called a croissant
Edit : also, don't apologize for your ignorance about something
A fool asking a question is only a fool for a few minutes
A fool not asking is one for life
I used to follow the news but since about 6 months it's all covid brexit and trump
The best i can do is ask alaxa for flash info in the morning and live my life
I follow politics of our most powerful neighbors so the UK's politics (but I think everyone did with the Brexit) and Germany's politics
I also have ideas that are probably very stereotyped or just not true like Italy has a corrupted president, Turkey, Poland, Hungary and Austria have crazy nationalist presidents and the Netherlands have a cool president
Usually I look up to politics of neighboring countries like Italy, Luxembourg, Germany
I also often looks up at the news from European Parliament and other European institutions
Not really
I just followed the Brexit 4 yrs dramasoap, and though this, discovered how low standards has become the UK's  political life
Other than that I have no idea of what's the political news in the other European countries
Since I live really close to the German and Swiss border I follow both countries really closely
I even follow the local politics of Baden-Wurttemberg and Basel Kanton since it can have a huge impact on us

As an ignorant American, what do you mean “without government”?
Thanks for the explanation
The Amazon Forest in Guiana
No one around for miles except for illegal gold miners
And huge-ass spiders
Funny because another comment also mentioned scary undergrounds in Brno
Czechia sure is a frightening place
Any mountain even
Strong chances you’re fucked at this point
I thought about Paris's underground tunnels (not just the catacombs -it' s gigantic-), but unlike what would happen if I came face to face with a skull, I would probably have a heart attack if I saw one of those spiders
That's extremely creepy, thanks for sharing
Same
Cant find anything on google
It's very common, but we even start drinking before that
I know I drank 12 beers at a family gathering when I was 13, I drank wine or cider with my parents
Of course high school parties were way worse but it's not when I started drinking alcohol
Well I'm going to oppose the trend here : in France, it's not *that* prevalent for an european country, or at least not in the 14-15 years old range
Most underage drinking is like when you're 17 (drinking age is 18)
We have quite a weird relationship to alcohol anyway, we love our booze as much as the English but less in a binge way, more in a casual way
We call that *alcoolisme ordinaire* (ordinary alcoholism), like drinking a single glass of wine just like you'd drink glass of soda, for the taste of it
Right, but highschool is where you really start to have drinking between young people, as opposed to young people being allowed to drink by adults
In France, there are only 11 political parties and only 4 of them share the majority of the votes
It's not great, but at least it's not a two-party system
I don't understand how the Brits and Americans can stand it
Any Bielorussian or Russian to answer the question
Like 6-7 parties ... Very healthy demecracy
Having just 2 parties would sound like dictatorship to us
And again, the 4 majority political parties are like coalisions since most of them have different currents with different tendencies within them
Action Contre La Faim, not for the fun but for an ethical principle
I technically have benefits from it but I don't really use it but my membership to the association Neurchi de Bières (a French beergeek FB group that became an association)
&#x200B;
It's still young and one of the benefits is a reduction code on a beer webshop
But being currently in Paris I don't really command online (when I was in Epinal it's was nearly mandatory, not that much now)
I buy anime Blue Ray that I like after torrenting them
I don't even have anything to read them
Books in bookshop
I feel like the only places I really like to be are places with many bookshops compared to the size of the city
Also: FUCK Amazon
Pourquoi pas
A "Ouais, t'as raison ouais" said with strong disdain is a great way to anger someone
Yep "touché" is French, for some reason it got exported as an Anglo expression, and it seems, in Italy too
We don't really use it in that kind of sense in France though
Given name + family name is the standard
Some people wear both parents family names with an hyphen in between (for instance "Valéria Bruni-Tedeschi")
Most people also have a second or even a third given name that appear on the ID but are never used irl
I have three for instance, and it's common to give some relative name
On top of my name, my parents gave me the ones of two great-grandfathers
In France, at least in culturally Christian families, there's the first name, the godfather's first name, one grandparent's first name, then the surname
One given name + possibly one, two or three middle names + either your father's or mother's or both last names
It is more common to only take your father's name because if hundreds of year of patriarchy, but it is becoming more and more common to take both name
But it basically comes down to this kinda name:
Juliette Martin
Nicolas Renaud
Marie Dupond
Patrice Rousseau
We only state our middle names for bureaucracy and stuff
>Most people also have a second or even a third given name that appear on the ID but are never used irl
I only have one given name, AMA
Some people have even more than three, I for example have four given names (as do all my family)
The order goes this way: given name + name of The Godfather/godmother + name of the grandfather/grandmother + name of the other grandfather/grandmother (as I have an older sister, she has the grandmothers’ names and I have the great-grandmothers’ names)
Is this like Russians do
Like Vladimir Vladimirovitch  Tchaikovsky or Sergueï Mikhaïlovitch Eisenstein
Legally we can go up to 6 I think
Hum now not really
You can name your child whatever you want as long as it's not against the baby's best interest
Like if you wanted to call it "Nutella" (which apparently has been the case) the civil official has/must stop you
The family is then asked to choose another name and if they don't want/don't find something else than it's the civil official that can name the child
Edit: why would you think that there is such list
No, but the local authorities can reject a given name if they think it could be prejudicial to the kid
There is no list of names, but there is a list of letters that are used in french, and therefor some accents you can't use
This has created some issues, because some regional names cannot be used
For example "ñ" is not a letter used in french, but it is used in breton so parents that want to name their son Fañch have to go to court to be able to use the name
Every country does this
Germany and the Holocaust is the exception
Every country wants to move on and forget the horrors it participated in/directly commited in the past
Not saying it's right, but Belgium is no different than France, the US, or any other country in this regard
Dead fighting for Napoléon probably
Doing what all of my ancestors did
Farming
well I would be getting ready for a revolution or two
But my family got sent to Algeria like 30 years later so assuming I would have managed like my predecessors I would work for the government until I was killed in a revolution or coup d'etat if unlucky, or banished to a colony best case scenario
Had I been born 100 years earlier (1893), I would have been German and would likely have fought as a german during WW1
Glad to see my single year of ancient greek finally come of use ! "Liberty or death" ?
It is optional in high school, but I dropped out of that class after a year because it was incredibly boring at the time
In hindsight, it was interesting and I should've paid attention
Unfortunately, democracies are on the decline
Everywhere, states become more authoritarian especially in Africa, South America, Asia and even Easter Europe
The total number of democracies is dropping worldwide and the ones left degrade
Dictatorship are even perceived as increasingly attractive, including by people living in democracies thanks to China and Russia soft powers
So obviously the left ones MUST stand with each other, stay strong and cope together with dictatorships and freedom-repressive policies until one day people living in current authoritarian states aim for freedom, revolt against their governments and overthrow them
I know you mean well but Taiwanese think of themselves as Taiwanese, not as Chinese
The "legitimate Chinese government" is something they're forced to claim if they don't want PRC to invade
PRC is the main proponent of the "Republic of China" fiction
The Taiwanese government and most of the population would love nothing more than to be officially called Taiwan, but China won't let it
I don't know if it's a French thing (it probably isn't) but I've always heard Laponie (Lapland) as being his home, specifically Rovaniemi
It funny to see proud Finns, and Swedes trying to discredit them
I grew up hearing Lapland and North Pole about equally
Same
Although it was already almost a tie between them when I was a kid
Laponie or the North Pole for me
I'd have answered the North Pole on instinct, but it seems like someone (Finland probably) has really been pushing for Lapland in the last decades
A resurrected half-god with wholes in his hands and feet, breaking and entering into people's homes to bring gifts to children in the middle of the night
That reads like a creepy pasta
Are Icelandic children actually taught to believe in the Yule Cat ? Because it sounds absolutely terrifying (but I love it)
The Christmas what now
Christmas news
What is that
Makes sense, no tourism money in the North Pole
The mental image of baby Jesus falling down the chimney with a Nintendo 64 is just too much for me to handle
It just ... Keeps improving
I need to doodle this
Shortly after "Taken" came out, and American girl asked me if it was safe to visit Paris, as she genuinely thought kidnapping young women and selling them at auction was a thing there
I've had many people believe that we French people casually cheat on each other on a daily basis
We don't, it's something the upper classes do or used to do (at least in movies), most of the population doesn't.
When I was learning chinese in High school we  had some chinese students coming to our school
I had 3 of them
They bielieved we were rich, like the entire country (I'm french ) and one even asked us to pay so he could come study here in college , the entire 3  years, with accomodation, food and transport
He sincerly bileved it would be easy for us to pay this, like if he was asking for a new pair of shoes or a cinema ticket
I had to tell him that we were not poor but average/average low, wich mean we could afford a cinema or even a restaurant like 3 or 4 times per years without trouble but couldn't pay for this
I myself had to work as a student and live with 3 roomate to share the bill
Then I save money and went to see them in their country and understood that the medias and their school made them see France as very rich place where everyone is pretty, rich, elegant, were it's all about romance and wine and castle etc
Some chinese tourists are so disappointed when they arrived that they created a programm to help them with depression after they arrived
Funny I see this post today
Yesterday some guy on Facebook insisted pasta with sugar was a common Parisian dish
An American once asked me if they sold guns in my village
Not me but a friend who was working at a tourist information center at La Bastille place in Paris was asked by many tourists where the Bastille prison is
Not where it was before it was demolished
Where it is now today, as in where the actual building is and when it opens for visits
The worst part was a French woman once asked that question too
Same with French people
I actually acquired a lot of wine knowledge because everyone kept asking me to chose the wine, even though I had no clue
I learned through trial and error: pick the house wine
I love the conclusion about bear
Great/good
Also, some people do believe that we eat frogs and snails on a daily basis
Oh, and tourists asking for "typical French food” in ultra-marine territories, expecting to be given boeuf bourguignon, raclette, fondue savoyarde or pot-au-feu
when it’s _super hot_ outside, and they come here at this time of the year _precisely_ because it’s hot and sunny and the beach
Honestly, depending on how old he might have know quite a bit, didn’t he
Alcohol consumption was something else back in the days
Plus, the famous brands are easy recommendations, and there are enough of these for about every occasion
I’m French and abroad and the old restaurant I used to work at loved to have me behind the bar for that reason
Apparently it sells better if you can pronounce Chardonnay properly
Who buys pasta in a jar
That “Probably because they’re drunk when they do it” was magnificent
Thanks for sharing
The VLE used by most public and private French schools (let's say 80%), Pronote, had a flaw that allowed the download of the enitre database remotly
The developpers took 3 months to fix it
Yep, that's us
Not even surprised
efface ça neveu
yes, some are still using Win 98, or even Win 95
If you just need a computer to do a simple task and you built a program to do it back then in the 90s, why will you change it
That'll be stupid to buy a brand new computer with Win 10 on it just to re-write a program to do the exact same thing as it was doing on Win 95
Rentre chez toi ruscaille
Dépaysement
It happens when you're in another country (or a place you're not usually in), and you truly feel like you're out of your routine, your usual habits
I wish I could translate perfectly routine too
And maybe also retrouvailles
finding again something/someone you cherished, a heartful reunion
On a daily basis, or at least a word I use much more often, is regard
The way a person looks at things, their look, their eyes
It’s more a question of nuance than a real "there is no translation and that bothers me": I often find myself faced with one unique English noun or adjective where we have several in French -there’s a lot of nuance lost, but it’s still understandable
bugs me out
"( avoir la ) Flemme" means kind of "( being ) lazy" but not in a negative way, it's almost a noble feeling
I have yet to see a one-word English equivalent of the French word "rentrée", which means "going back" or "coming back", and is used for that time period where kids go back to school (and workers come back from their break)
Of course that is has a big impact in terms of society and economics
Feels like a word every language should have
We do this every time but I don't think we've a word for this
Same here, we have "la journée" (from sunrise to sunset) and "le jour" (24-hour day)
I love kombinować. In french we have the word "combine" translate to n°3
There is "si" in french that looks kinda similar, it can be used to reply as a "yes" after a "no", and can also be used as a "so" in "it is so good" - "c'est si bon"
Tu aurais du préciser que routine en francais et en anglais n'a pas le même sens
Les gens pourraient ne pas comprendre pourquoi tu n'arrives pas à le traduire correctement
We call that a meal
Meal is a whole thing here
When i went to england they ate in front of TV the barbares
Funny, for example
Marrant, drôle, cocasse, amusant, bizarre, comique, curieux, impayable, hilarant, rigolo, spirituel, etc: those all translate to "funny". But a "cocasse" thing is not exactly the same as a "drôle" thing -there’s a nuance in the _way_ it’s funny
Something "cocasse" is something that is funny because it is somewhat strange, while something "drôle" is just something that makes you laugh
I might just lack vocabulary in English, but I don’t know of words that would convey these nuances
I feel like the English nuances are more turned toward how much something makes you laugh (the difference between funny and hilarious for example; we have that too), not the reason why you laugh
I love German so much
You guys have such a rich and pertinent language, I don’t get why everyone is hating on it and I really miss speaking it
Yup
Some people even say "au jour d'aujourd'hui"
Keine hate
Nuch eine 'not useful thing'. Ich also miss Deutsch language
I know that
I just feel like we do not highlight the same nuances (as I said up there)
Some people say these are ugly
Mosaic walls and unusual windows
My least favorite building in France is the [Bibliothèque Nationale de France] (National French Library), or Bibliothèque François Mitterrand
It is everything a library shouldn't be: foreboding, intimidating, almost dystopian
When you walk in there you feel like you're going to prison
It's a great institution that provides a lot for academics, and in some ways it looks cool and all, but the architecture is all wrong for the building's actual purpose
Really makes you sympathize with the Corsican way to deal with this kind of things (a healthy dose of C4 before the buildings get inhabited)
We have [some of those (but worse)] in France too
It's like the quintessence of cheapo 90's architecture
Unpopular opinion: i like thé tour Montparnasse
Paris shouldn't be a museum city, time hasn't stopped in 1870
It's a welcome change in the cityscape and a rather impressive view when exiting la gare Montparnasse
With this mindset, we wouldn't have the Eiffel tower or le centre Pompidou (i love this building)
You're being harsh imo
The building isn't ugly in and on itself
It's more the difference with the rest of the neighborhood that shocks most of the time
I love this list
The way they carefully justify each choice is very German
Apparently, next year’s Rubik’s cube world championships are going to be in Almere (random fact)
> the
>Imec-Tower
just what is even going on there
But all houses do look the same in some parts of Belgium too
Well brutalisme is shite when you live in it, but as a distant piece of architecture it can look cool
Or as a university
Might be Stockholm syndrome but I appreciate an ugly brutalist university, as long as I don’t have to live in it
Feels like you can do anything with it, and if you burn it down by mistake it’s no biggie
>They had a great old building and they spend millions on putting a
>bathtub
> next to it
Lol, thanks for this wonderful and accurate description
That was Guy de Maupassant, IIRC
Mafia is generally alright with building projects actually since they mainly care about money
It led to them being at odds with FLNC at times
Well they teach us they exist, that's pretty much all
Teaching religion in public school is illegal in France, except in Alsace-Moselle, due to them being German when these laws about religion in school came out
A private school can still teach religion
In France, state and church are completely separated
The French constitution states in its very first article : "France is
a laical Republic
France respects all beliefs".
As a result, state schools absolutely do not teach religion, it is actually forbidden for both teachers and pupils to openly express their religious affiliation (for example, religious signs such as headscarves, crucifix necklaces or kippahs cannot be worn at school unless they can be hidden under clothing)
History classes may cover religious subjects but only ever in relation with historical events ( for exemple, the Saint Bartholomew day massacre was a violent clash between Catholics and Huguenots during the Renaissance)
Private schools on the other hand may offer religious studies
I only really know about Catholic private schools
The ones I know are very relaxed when it comes to religion and pupils do not actually have to be Catholic or to go to religious classes in order to attend
Some may be stricter, but for the majority of them, religion does not play a huge role in the teaching itself
I'm always a bit shocked when I hear my British friends talking about private schools in the UK
Some had to prove they were baptised and regularly going to Church
This sounds very alien to me
In the same way, I have seen pupils wearing religious clothing in British schools which was a bit strange at first
Yes, because our country is christian
But if you or your parents didn't want you to attend religion class that's fine
Instead you had morals class
It depends, in private schools they do sometimes
I think it's moslty an opt-in thing, but sometimes in very religious schools you don't get a choice
Well, it depends where you are and what kind of school you attend
Public schools in France don't have "Religion" as a subject, except in Alsace and Moselle as the law about the separation of the state and church was passed when it was a part of Germany (1905)
Otherwise private school often do that as they're very often linked with religions, almost exclusively catholicism
Yeah, it's only taught as part of History classes, as a culture aspect, not what they preach
As to why, separation of church and state is very important here
Of course that only refer to public school, some private ones might be more inclined to have religious education
But about 85% of children are in public schools
WTF, in what school where you‽ If a private Catholic school than yes, but don't go here telling people yes, when actually no
School with this kind of lesson are a minority
The actual answer would be:
No we don't have it except in private schools
And if you do have them in public school, you're either living in Alsace for the laws there are different, or it's an exception and your school decide to put this class as an option
Also our country *was* Christian
France is a laïc country for over a century now
I have never heard of something like this treaty
This kind of catholic schools are not that common though
Most don't have chapels on the grounds
They are mostly in big cities in very religious neighborhoods
The majority of catholic schools in the country are like public schools but with an opt-in religious course and some kind of celebration for christmas and easter ( as in you get chocolates and maybe go to church to see some people sing)
We still do learn about religions, but through the scope of history and geography classes
Not as a subject of its own
Unless you attend a private school but it still wouldn’t be mandatory
According to Fox News there are no go zones in Paris where shariah law is applied
And here I thought that money didn't really have an odour for the Swiss
Lyon : Already a big city, more central than Paris
Clermont-Ferrand : really central
Versailles ofc but only if we have a Capetian king back or a Bonaparte emperor again ( there are still heirs for both dynasties )
I just can't see a politican there
Belfast for the independantists I guess
Wouls feel weird honestly
Because of History, it feels like Greece's capital must be Athens or Sparta
Let's move it to Cayenne for the lolz
Ajaccio or Rennes for the sheer chaos it would cause
Lyon’s other name is “Capitale des Gaules”
Marseille would probably be a more fitting candidate than Clermont, Lyon ans Marseille battle for the second post populaires (Lyon in it's city is second, but Marseille in it's Urban Area is second, both behind Paris)
Plus Marseille is a major economic Center in France
Lille, one of the biggest french city, and no Parisians to be seen
Have you seen the face of the current Bonaparte heir
The Emperor of punchable faces
Dutch side go back to the Netherlands, French side annexed by France, everybody’s happy and we put an end to this failed experiment
Oh and Brussels become the official capital or Europe, and doesn’t belong to any country, just the European Union
TIL that Vienna and Bratislava are only 1h apart by car, I never imagined two capitals would be that close to their country's border
Too big of a city
Saint Pierre et Miquelon would be even crazier
Well, Marseille would be actually a good candidate
It's the second largest city in France in urban area, and one of the major economic centers, especially in Gas and Fuel
Or we could kidnap the pope for old time sake
I dont care about his faces, I care about personnalities, purpose of ruling and loyalty from the ruler to his own nation
Why is it not a good idea ? Most European countries work like this already
I'd rather have the capital remain in the EU to be honest
Clipperton, to finally assert our claim there !
I mean they all have decapitable heads anyway
That's the beauty of royals
You mean like an
European Union
Always those silly jokes
During the revolution like 90% of beheaded people were just peasants or random people suspected of « having sympathies » for the king, according to « La loi des suspects » ( 1793 ) but there are always some goofy people fetishising about beheading on those years
I feel like France is in charge in the UE's foreign affairs, like I feel we are alone with Greece against Erdogan, alone with Armenia against Erdogan and Azerbaijan, alone in our will to not be USA's puppet but overall the UE seems pretty hollow to me
We provide the nukes and manage the foreign affairs
I believe France to be one of the pillars of the EU
I have a double French/Polish nationality
Sometimes I feel like I'm not sure which country I should be rooting for
Tbh I didn't even know you were in the EU
Do you think you would get even more tourists if you were a part of Italy ? Serious question !
>we provide cheaper labour force
And that's a big problem, we call this social dumping in our country
I feel Greece is an important member of Europe, the influence of Greece over the continent is so fundamental
And we love you, I think that Europeans generally do not have anything bad to say about the Greeks, even if we collectively had to send a bit of money to you guys
Being from Marseille, Greece has a special place in my heart
We are a Greek city, our flag colors are the one of Greece
Not EU related but Portuguese immigration help rebuild our country after WW2 and for that we are grateful
Not everyone is though sadly
Being French, I have to say I like how Ireland is this pebble in British shoes
More seriously I admire how you finally could come together as a nation and leave violence behind to become this flourishing country you now are
Sosem lesz diktatúra
Also since Brexit we are the only UE member with nuclear power, a permanent membership of the security council, and a military force we are actually able to send somewhere else
You export truck drivers
It's a thing i guess
(sorry, outside of low income job, i don't really know either, do you have a hub like Estonia has with Tech ?)
From a strict European construction point of view, I feel relieved the UK is finally out of the EU
I believe the UK vision of the EU was nothing more than a business-level integration meanwhile, at least for the founding states, the EU is way more than economy
It is first of all peace and mutual cooperation
I think the island factor, as well as how the British see themselves as a global power, led to the misconception that the UK could eventually mold the EU to their views
Just look how the Brexit negotiations go, this sentiment that the UK can have the upper hand, that they are a negotiation force, how some believe the EU will suffer from the Brexit to a point of its desintegration, all this is preposterous and show how the negotiators have an inflated view of UKs supposed grandeur if not superiority
I genuinely love the British people, but you definitely have the worst political class
Well to be fair, the UK always was the kid alone at the back of the class
You didn't really fit in, maint due to the anti-EU sentiment
You weren't part of Schengen nor the Euro zone, and most of your contracts were with France or Germany
In the end, you were important for the other less integrated countries, but your economy is easily replaced by the emergenxe of Eastern Europe, and France's Nuclear Arsenal is the 3rd in the world, so we're still covered on that
Each country is important in their own place, but the UK always seemed like it was never there to me, hence is the most easily replacable
You are in without being in, you don't want the euro, you are out of Schengen zone
We Southerners are not that bad, you know
I have so much respect for Spain, how Spain became a true, strong, democracy in such a limited time
You guys have quite an difficult past of dictators, coups d'Etat, until quite recently
I love how your King, virtually raised by Franco, nonetheless instated a true democracy at Franco's death
You guys are important in Europe, and you are our gateway to Latin America
I feel like in diplomacy if you make no one angry it generally means you are doing nothing
It helps that Macron basically got elected on a « strong EU » platform as opposed to the fascist hag
Having a leader that basically got elected saying « I will do everything to make EU strong and relevant » really gives him a lot of political leeway to actually do stuff on the European level compared to someone who got elected on a EU sceptic platform and who therefore can’t be seen being too active at the European level without being seen as flip flopping
Ideally what would be great is if no one was anyone’s lackey
That’s what we should aspire as Europeans anyway
>and wasnt afraid to say no to the US
Because it's our son
Well, its not like you have much coice
Every other country is either "I don't want to get involved into global politics" or straight out "I don't like the Union"
If you don't like France's leadership, just take the head
Well, you have a Bourbon king after all
Oh I think I actually knew that at some point, I just forgot it
Norway is the only one that is not in the EU at all, right
This is the principle, but the problem has been identified, our parliament is working on a legislative arsenal to counteract these abuses
For example, in the coming years Polish or other detached workers may be refused in our country, because they are not subject to our work regulations
well, you got some money to compensate, no ? That what we have in France when a commune have anything with "nuclear" in the name
The commune is paid by the gov, of the case of "if" something bad happens
What is the general sentiment
Why are people rejecting a full integration
My feeling is that nordic countries don't really feel they are sharing the same history and cultural values than Europe
Is this word related to "Merkel" or not at all ? xd
Sweden litteraly joined EU to be part of a bigger, stronger entity
Yes France has more muscle, can you blame her for taking care of things within the EU because, apparently, no one is willing to ?
France has a particular historical relationship with Armenia
There is a huge armenian community in France and they are influencial enough to push their agenda
So on this very topic we need a counterbalance force within the EU to safeguard Macron's willingness to get involved
Ok, thanks
>If we wanted that we would've joined NATO,
Since when NATO did anything to diplomacy ?
You litteraly said it, you joined EU for Economy, social and culture
And guess what, its exactly what the EU uses !
Because the EU rely nearly solely on soft power, on being an economic power house, on being so diverse
On being the fucking grown up !
> and because of its foundational ideology of keeping the peace,
And what do you think France is trying to achieve by being world police ?
You think we're doing it because of self image problems ? Because we longed the Colonial days ?
Just because our country did some things bad don't mean we can't change and strive to be better, for ourselves and the world
Germany too did some horrible things ! Yet they don't get hit all the time about it
&#x200B;
> Can you blame the USA for Iraq and Afghanistan
Talk about a strawman
Because invading a country over falsified proof, and leading the EU's foreign relations is totaly the same thing
&#x200B;
All you just want is the return of the good old isolationism
Because you think you'll be spared if you don't try to do anything
Because putting your head in the sand is a "valid tactic"
If you wanted that, you joined the wrong Union
>FRANCE dictating EU's foreign policy without having been asked and without having explicit mandate for it
Exept France isn't saying "The EU this", or "The EU that"
France is talking about its own position,a nd tries to talk other EU members into adopting the same
Yes we ARE pressuring more than other, and i think its because Macron want a stronger EU, more "Federation like", rather than a loose bunch of country
> The EU is not your personal army
Go fight your own crusades and let the individual states make up their own minds
We didn't waited you to say that
We've been busy fighting since early 2020 agaisnt terrorism in Africa
Who joined us ? No fucking one
We're supporting Greece, who joined us ? ONLY ITALY
> Germany prefers to err on the side of caution, but they're not passive
Germany err to the sive of being passive
Else they would actually try to do something other than being a starfish
Turkey is menacing greece, a country milked by germany, and germany say nothing
Sub-saharian africa is beging for help agaisnt terrorist, and germany, the second military in this god damned union is doing nothing
Both are threats agaisnt us
One is directly toward a member
Don't tell me germany is "cautious" when their position is to say "pls don't fight".
&#x200B;
Yes France has taken the head of the Foreign Diplomacy, because its the best suited for
Yes we often talk for the Eu, again because we are the one with the stronger "punch". But what tells you we are not "mandated" by YOUR government about this
Do you really think the members would just "let France because a Diplomatic dictator" without doing anything ?
You say "Democracy", but last i checked, there are ministers that are trusted with special issues
Like a Foreign affairs minister
France has this role
Depends highly on the country
In France I don’t see any big downside honestly
We have various apps allowing you to get treated by a doctor fast enough and we have a card (called carte vitale) which looks like a credit card, you give it to the doctor and it allows the administration to reimburse you very fast for what you pay without paperwork
The organism in charge of healthcare costs, pensions, etc
is in debt
Has been for quite some times, I believe
It’s a rather big part of our national debt (10,5% in 2015)
Hopefully someone who understands how the Sécurité Sociale works better than I do will chime in
Edit: as others said for their own country, healthcare is not actually free
We pay for it by other means
But I don’t believe that’s a downside, as it’s the very basis of the system -it’s just the way it works
Plus, the logic behind it is that we help each others in times of need
Sure, I usually don’t go to the doctor, and pay for more than I use
But the day my sister broke both her legs, my family was not the one paying for her hospitalization: that was French society at large, in a (roughly put) way
Some people abuse of it, my father was a nurse in an emergency room, many people came for not much (like a small wart or a cold), so the emergency rooms was crowded and those people wanted to see a doctor before others (with important injuries) and would get violent and insult them all day long when they said "no". They did it so they won't have to pay for those small medication in a pharmacy or to avoid paying the doctor (even if they get their money back after)
The only way to calm them was to call the police or sometime hi black colleagues would say something like "why are you yelling, it's because I'm black isn't it
", this would calm them down since they didn't want to look racist
Waiting time can be long, but it depend of when you come, I went to the pediatrics emergency room twice for my son, the first time I waited about 30min, the second time about 1h30
I went with my (adult) cousin to the ER once for a broken leg, she waited about 3 hours but it can be much more sometime
(they receive you as soon as you arrive and then you wait for the doctor/nurse,  so if you have sometime very dangerous/important you go first, if not you wait
I see a lot of comments about waiting time, but we don’t have that problem in France so really, I can’t think of any downside
\- It is pretty expensive if you don't actually have necessity to use it, but I see it as a guaranteed by state investment for when I'll get older, like our retirement system
\- Numbers of new accepted doctor students are regulated by the government (at least in France, it's called a numerus clausus), and these numbers are very low
So there is a very long waiting line to get to some specialist (most notably eye doctors, even dentists if you're not already a patient)
Also those who have the best grade get to chose their specialty, so worst doctors are often where there is little money to make (geriatrics, emergency
Aside from the healthcare system, hospitals get less and less credits
It leads to doctors and nurses getting overworked and fleeing to private institutions
Where I live, they opened a private clinic about 15 years ago in the suburbs of my little city that had an agreement to unload some weight on the saturated hospital in city-centre (notably emergencies and some little standard procedures)
But considering some of the acts don't make money, or little, well they don't. The hospital was old so it's been rebuilt at the same place, so with no possibility to expand, taking into account that some of the load would be lifted which is not
So we have an hospital still overcrowded and a private clinic you can use but with an abusive mark up
This private clinic had a very nice reputation upon opening (because accessing to the hospital in the city center was horrible if you're from outside) but people start to realise they are just as greedy as you can get
That is something that is becoming really more and more common in France these days, and I'm afraid our current system won't be sustainable for long
>The only downside I see are waiting times (when it comes to surgeries) when you have a disease that is not severe
You can be waiting for weeks or months
Sure, but it makes perfect sense: if I need my tonsils removed, and another guy comes in with a bullet in his stomach, yeah, take care of him first
I see that as paying for the privilege to live in a society where people don’t die of untreated curable diseases in the street
That depends, for example I had a quick panic attack (involving chest pain) last year that only lasted 30 minutes and the man on the phone still sent an ambulance that brought me to the hospital just to make sure there was nothing serious even though my vital signs were good on the electrocardiogram they did at my home
I think even if it is not an immediate emergency they don't joke with things like chest pain, better safe than sorry with lots of expenses later
Everything was free for me
I’m not sure it has anything to do with free healthcare though as we do also have private hospitals
In my case I think heart attack was out of the question with the electrocardiogram but I'm so sorry for your loss
No one should experience that
English
I mean, it's just such a big melting pot of so many different languages - mostly German, French, Norske
- that the same few letters can be pronounced basically anything
Also there's so many words that comes from Roman languages but they completely changed the meaning of them, so when you learn English you're like "Oh I know what *Actually* means, it's like *Actuellement* in French
" but no
Why did they decided to change the meaning
Mystery
Does their new meaning make sense regarding the etymology of the word
not at all
Hungarian and Finnish seem to be the "strangest" languages in Europe
None who are you to tell if a language makes sense or not ? A language is the reflection of a culture
I think Dutch is strange to read: double e, double o, k's all around
we say four twenty ten nine
> Its flow of speech is the same as spanish, it uses same phonemes as spanish
On the Spanish side of the border
On the French side it's more like Gascon
>  Also they’ll still look down on you because you’re not actually French
r/thatHappened
I doubt it's nearly as underrated as 9/10th of the Romance languages people aren't even aware exist
God my brain has to work to hard to understand any of it
I think I know the basics of the Spanish civil war, it was taught in school when I grew up
What I know little about is the 30 years war which ended with the treaty of Westphalia, which shaped a lot of modern Europe
Also, I happen to know a lot about the Franco-Prussian war, but it's something which has gone forgotten from mainstream history knowledge, while it's the precursor and the root cause of WW1 and WW2
- Everything Eastern Europe between the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and WW1
It seems like a very crazy affair
Living in Alsace, I'm amazed that some Swedish army came down over here to fuck things up during that time
School start at 7:55
Periods are 55 minutes long, I have one break in the morning that last 15 minutes at 9:45 (We don't have time between classes lol, not even 5 minutes)
I have 55 minutes to eat, at 11:55
Then I have another break at 15:30 which also lasts 15 minutes
I finish school at 5:35
(17h35)
In primary school we started at 8am and finished a 4:30pm
Middle school and high school were pretty much the same starting at 8am and finishing at 5pm
Yeah this is a pretty long day if I look at the other answers on this post
We had like 2 hours for lunch from 12 to 2pm
In all 3, we had Wednesday afternoon free
I'm currently studying Computer science, not in university but in an IUT (Universiterian institute of technology) and my days are more or less 8am to 6pm every day
Your days are so short
I'm so jealous
Oh yeah I'm a dumbass, thanks for pointing it out
Yeah my younger self is jealous about your younger self hahaha
At one point in french History, a monarch could have regain the throne, but he declined because they would'nt change the blue/white/red flag to a full white one
The french monarchists lose their last chance of getting into power because of the color of a fucking flag XD
One time in 16th century Strasbourg, hundreds of people danced non-stop for days and wouldn't stop for any reason
This was the [Dancing Plague of 1518

The First Communist Revolution acrually happened in France during the Paris Commune event, un 1870
Unsuccessful, because the Newly formed Third Republic AND the Prussians kept the siege of Paris going to end the rebellion
The communist Red Flag was also inventes in France during the first Socialist uprisings in 1848, used previously as a symbol to the masses to disperse before the guards start shooting during a protest, it was transformed Into a symbol of Socialist demands and revolts
The French beheading the French king during the French revolution
Some guys did that with a lama here
They stole the thing from a zoo, called it Serge, and took it for a tour in the tramway
The name Serge is a reference to a French singer, Serge Lama
That reminds me of that US intern terrorist attack with the [killdozer]
This sounds so British haha
So did the French, an event called the Saint Barthelemy
Is there a Frencher name than “Jean-Charles Pichegru”, I wonder
3000 French-African cavalry in WW1 pierced the frontline from Macedonia to the Danube river in Hungary, 800 kilometers north from here
Cut from the supply and communication lines they captured Uskub (now Skopje) defended by 50000 men, causing Bulgaria to demand armistice, and the retreat to Hungary of the 11th german army
Which was cut in their retreat by the same cavalry and surrendered
They pursued their advance in spite of the austrian armies and reach the Danube where they waited for their army to join them
They progressed so fast the rest of their expedition force (French, Serb, Greek, British, Italian) took 22 days to catch up with them
The war had been over for 4 days at this point
They had no way to know
Since they were fighting on the "minor" eastern front and on "outdated" horseback they got little recognition back home, despite having a major role in the end of WW1 (major contribution in taking out an Axis member, a German army and was a pain in Austria's butt, singlehandedly)
General Jouinot-Gambetta who commanded that cavalry,  would write a book about them
"Uskub or the role of the african cavalry in the Victory". But even with Prime Minister and worst Nobel Prize winner ever Aristide Brilland would wrote the preface for the book they're still fuckin unknown
Overall the role of the entire eastern front in the end of the war is terribly overlooked
I answered that to another comment
I was a reference to what [Louis Bonaparte] said when his brother (Napoléon Bonaparte) gave him the title of "king of holland". The guy tried to learn a bit of dutch, but he mispronounced konig
We have this verb as well and actually it's mostly used about criminality when someone push someone through a window
Fun fact: it depends on your language
We had a Math teacher exactly like the one you described
I still remember her name, she was Mrs
Green
She was a good woman
I was gutted when I heard that she’d succumbed to COVID
This was May-June of last year
She was the reason Math was my favourite subject in 8th grade
Quite ironic that a country that beheaded its nobelty and king created a monarchy not even 20 years after the revolution
It would be Bastille Day for me
There's just a nice feeling of national unity, it's summertime, the parade is always a treat to watch, the firefighters organize bals at their stations and there are fireworks everywhere
In 2018, we won the World Cup the day right after Bastille Day, so it was an incredible two days
For me it's May 1st (workers day)
It's the only holiday where really *only* essential services (like hospitals) are allowed to stay open
In almost every city,  public transport is stopped (national railway and airports still works, and public transport in Paris, but that's all)
There are protests organized by unions but they are usually in a very friendly and nice atmosphere
Tradition is to offer *muguet* ([lily-of-the-valley] on that day, so the only "stores" opened are people selling it in the street
Anyone can do that, you don't need any permit to sell *muguet* on may 1st
I just really like it, the flowers, the quiet since everything is closed
It's relaxing
Christmas for me, there is an overall chill and relax mood that I love, it's snowy, with christmas decoration everywhere
When it's over and January starts that's so depressing
I'm usually not a big barbecue guy but that looks fucking amazing
Same
And it goes with the beginning of the summer holidays for many of us, which often enough gives it the “summer feels”.
They do celebrate it
It’s a national celebration, I believe they _have_ to celebrate it, and even if it were not mandatory I doubt they’d let go of a national holiday, the fireworks, etc that go with it
Yes it is :) the whole country is united in that regard now, its been a long time since the revolution and the government has always been very good at repressing regional differences
But anyway, regardless of the reasons, it's celebrated there like anywhere else
I'm not aware of anything like this
I'm positive they get a national holyday like the rest of the country, and I'm sure most people do celebrate it
The uprisings are water under the bridge, and tho it's still a catholic bastion, I'm pretty sure actual royalists are, like everywhere else, regarded as marginals
It kinda depends here in France
It's often the 24th in the evening and we call it "réveillon de Noël", "Christmas Eve" literarily
But also a lot of people do it on the 25th too
When I was a kid we had this big celebration and dinner with family on Christmas Eve, and then we went to bed and in the morning we would open the presents
Now that there are no kids anymore, we celebrate and have dinner on the 25th
But I know it's a real debate among some folks whether you should open presents the 24th at night or the 25 !
Merry Christmas and happy holiday everybody !
It's funny seeing people fighting a out whether it's the 24th or the 25th, in my family it's always been both
A great diner the 24th, we open our gifts either at midnight or in the morning
Then we go at it again the 25th with more food
We did both
Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve, then on the morning of the 25th we'll get our gifts and have a Christmas lunch, often with other family members
> But I know it's a real debate among some folks whether you should open presents the 24th at night or the 25 !
We'll all you have to do is wait for midnight to open your present and you technically open them the 25th
That's what we do in my family when we're impatient
Wait, doesn't everybody have a feast on both days
Christmas Eve dinner with presents (we do presents during l'apéritif) , some go to mass at midnight
on the 25th you have mass in the morning (if you're religious of course) and after another Christmas lunch that ends around 3 or 4 pm (la sobremesa for our Spanish friends)
Vannak-e emberek, akik December 23-án este ünnepelnek valamit
I think I did that on some years too actually !
It was like the continuity of what happened the night before, it was pretty cool
I think most my friend did this !
It's technically the 25th, but it's not morning I guess ? It didn't fit the trope of Santa bringing gift in the night while you slept
Depends I guess ?
I know we used to have dinner at night, and lunch on the 25th most of the time
But when you have a big family and you have to go to one side of the family then the other it's complicated !
To me presents during apéritif or lunch always felt super early ahah
Well, in my case, while we were young and still believed in Santa we waited til morning, but since now both my sister and I are adults we just open them after midnight, this way we keep the 25th thing and we just cheat morning for a few hours :')
Köszönöm, nagyon érdekel a kultúrátok ^ ^
Hát akkor nem értem hogy miért láttam ilyen sok ajándékok fotóját tegnap este
Ahah i definitely get you ! I did this for a several years, and weirdly went back to 25th in the morning two years ago !
I definitely see the perks of waiting until morning
There's something whimsical about it, like a fairy tale
Plus everything's better when you've waited for it
I guess I'm just too impatient
Plus it's not only up to me
Lehet, hogy én vagyok ^ ^
[Jean Rochefort]
Can’t find more French looking man !
If I meet [this guy] in the street, I am 92% sure he is french
Half the "distinctively [insert nationality]" that I’ve seen here could have been French to me
I might be super bad at facial recognition, but I think it also has got to do with the fact that a "facial nationality" is not really _that_ much of a thing (not saying distinct features do not exist, just that we’ve shared much of those over time)
If I did that I'd be aaccused of racism
That's how crazy it is nowadays
When in Paris, you guys are less loud than Italians in the transports ! Except if it’s a group of students hahaha (but it’s cool they always look fucking happy, it’s really nice to see)
I can relate to this
Though many would think Middle Easterners or Arabs would look the same, I somehow pick up on subtle features to identify a Lebanese, Syrian, Turk or Persian
I am originally Lebanese
Not really common but totally French, you’re right !
A spanish guy would be more tanned than him I think
But if I have to give an example, I think [Pierre Niney] looks very "french". I don't know why tho
I notices a lot of english guys wear tatoos in London
I don't know if it's just my impression or not tho
More of a wealthy parisian stereotype than a french one though
Oh my fucking god she’s a stereotype hahaha
I admit I use it for my legs at the beginning of summer, because they are too white otherwise compared to the rest of my body (I wear a lot of jeans/pants during spring)
&#x200B;
But never on my face/arms, it's too noticeable
I have to agree, they have a particular look ! I’m not the biggest fan because sometimes there’s a whole bunch looking a bit too similar but it’s still sophisticated, I agree
But I think you’ll find that funny : we have the same conversation about Londoners when in London with my friends haha
Idk what it is, it’s the leather shoes, the shirts, idk, but some of you guys have a rock but really smart and sophisticated heritage in the way you dress and we love that
Also : the suits
Man
The suits
It’s from protesting all the time
Definitely Paris, it got like 36M visitors last year which is better than 95% of other whole countries
Then there's Disneyland, the Alps and Pyrenees in Winter (but to be fair all of our mountain ranges are pretty nice, and in the one near where I live there was traffic jam for the first time at the summit of a station so it's regaining some interest) the Riviera in Summer, the Atlantic coast is also a good spot for surfing and swimming, Brittany, Normandy, Alsace and Corsica are some of the nicest and most visited regions, there's also the whole Southern half that is really interesting to see, and for overseas, Polynesia (mostly Tahiti), Guadeloupe and Martinique get rather few tourists compared to mainland regions but it's still not that bad, and are mostly visited by people from nearby countries and by the French themselves
L'ile de France, which is saturated with tourists everywhere in high season, and la côte d'azur, I'm not introducing it
Easily Paris
Many tourists who come to France only check out Paris
Well, if there's one thing France doesn't lack, it's tourists
France has very varied landscapes and meteorological conditions so tourists may go to different parts on the country depending on what they're after
Most international tourists go to the Côte d'Azur (Cannes, St Tropez, Nice) on the Mediterranean coast during the summer or to the Alps (Courchevel, Megève, Arc 2000) for skiing in the winter and of course Paris which is the most visited city in France by far
Foreigners also go to French overseas regions (Bora Bora, Tahiti, St Bart), especially on their honeymoons
French people may go to less famous locations such as Normandie (Deauville, Trouville) and Bretagne ( Belle-île en mer, St Malo, Douarnenez) on the western coast during the summer or to the Pyrénées mountains in the winter
&#x200B;
Personally, I would recommend less crowded regions such as Alsace, the Loire castles and the Auvergne mountains
I also happen to really like the northern coast (Boulogne sur Mer, Le Touquet) which is very scenic although the water is a bit colder
If you put Paris and French Riviera aside, i'd say Mont-Saint-Michel is the place
Paris all year long
Mediterranean coast in summer
Biggest worldwide ski resorts in winter
Also between Marseille and Nice/Monaco (Provence in general) there are a lot of tourists
I was one of them in Provence a few weeks ago and everywhere (Marseille, Cassis, Aix, Avignon, Nice) has a lot of tourists
It would almost be shorter to list areas that *don't* get a fuckton of tourists
You just wrote the composition of France !
Saw lots of "local" tourists in southern Brittany last week
Beyond that, lots of Germans and way more Americans than I'd thought there'd be, what with the travel restrictions and all
Toute l'île de France ? Je suis pas sur que la Seine-Saint-Denis soit un haut lieu touristique
I honestly hesitated with the Mont Saint-Michel
Both the Mont and Île de France are touristy, but at least there’s more to the second one than just tourism
Not sure there is much life in the Mont itself
Yeah that's what I told (Riviera is the English word for Côte d'Azur)
La Lozère et le Limousin mdr
Comment tu fait CDG -> Paris
Via notre bien aimé RER B :)
Provence is not a part of Riviera
Je prends l'avion à Luxembourg quand je vais à l'étranger ;)
It’s past of the PACA region
[Toujours notre bien aimé RER B donc
I know, I grew up there
It's Provence, Alpes & Côte d'Azur
It doesn't mean one is part of the other
Je pars pas de Strasbourg hein et de toute façon je dois prendre le train 3 fois par an
I would say most knows every or almost every state by names but wouldn't be able to tell the list
Like they would be "Oregon
Yes it's a state" but wouldn't be able to say all of them by earth
Most probably knows where are precisly 3 or 4 max on a map and maybe a bit more if they are est or west, hot or cold etc
Most won't know their capital but knows the city itself
People will have heard of most of them, and can probably name some locations or stereotypes but don't expect them to know much more
Especially if you're not from one of the most famous ones (Florida, California, Alaska, Hawaii, New York, Texas)
The rest is pretty much considered interchangeable and the majority couldn't place them on a map
I would not be capable to recite the 50 states, probably 20 or 30
I would be able to acurately place on a map maybe a dozen
As State capitals, that is another level
people would know the names, but wouldn't really know where they are or what they're like (with the exception of New York, Texas, California and maybe Hawaii)
In High School geography class, I had to learn them all and place them on a map, but 20 years later I can only do it for half of them at the most
Not sure if they could place them, but most people are familiar with some of them: Texas, Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Florida
Easy to identify
If you give a state name, probably could easily tell it's a US state
But could never name most of them, or point them on a map outside of the well known ones (Texas, California, Florida
And it takes it name from a fairly big city in southern France, but misspelled for some reason (two Ls in the French city)
Got 48 of them in 2min30, and spent 5 minutes staring blankly at Iowa and Mississippi
Not going to let that stop me from being proud to name all of New England
And even then, I'd feel like the person assumes I'm not aware of the existence of Georgia the state
And tbh, I think it'd be pretty rare that someone from Georgia, US is mistaken from a native of Georgia the country
And some cities
Like Paris, Texas
Not really, except maybe those from Bretagne, Corse or Alsace ... for exemple because they have a strong local identity
Most people just say they are from a city or "near that city".
Most of the time Regions are just like an administration thing, not an identity/culture stuff, for exemple I'm from Auvergne-Rhônes-Alpes région
But people from Auverge have a different identity than those from the Alpes for exemple, the old patois is different, culture too etc
It's too big for us (even if they are small compared to US states)
We would rather say I'm from "this department". My region have 12 departements and those departement often have a"friendly" rivalty between each others
Departement were not originally a "cultural" or "historical" area with a local identity, they were made so a man on a horse would be able to go from the main town to the borders of it in one day ride
So some can have weird forms depending of mountains, rivers etc
and then changed to fit some practicle purpose
That is a nice story, thanks for sharing it
I saw a comment by a Polish who put a sentence on what only comas mattered
So here is one in french but I think that this is the same in english but this is all I have to offer :
"C'est l'heure de manger, les enfants !" =   Time to eat, children !
"C'est l'heure de manger les enfants !" = Time to eat the kids !
je me tut (I stop talking)
je me tue ( I kill myself)
The German exchange students taught me this during one of my German trips in school, was a delight to use on my essays lol
Me too
Sorry because this is all what I have to "offer".
Jag tallar inte swenska
Trust me, it's difficult even for us

And in reverse, when I'm talking  english it's really frustating because of the "lack" of choice, especially to for description
For a good things it's almost always great, amazing, good or awesome
We have a lots of adjectives that mean almost the same but not exactly the same while english language have only one or too so I never manage to express what I really mean
But I still love english
French has been used as the lingua franca for this reason
Subtle nuances helps when dealing with diplomacy
Most of the French comments I’ve read her said no
And I couldn’t disagree more
Being french means being European
We have to be involved in the future of the continent because, in the end, we’re just a bunch of small states
If we would fight economically alone against the US, Canada or China, we would already have been eaten !
We made war to each other for literally centuries before realizing that we can grow so much bigger and faster if we do it together
Europe, the European Union, the monetary union, all have a lot of flaws, I couldn’t agree more
But it’s such a gift
It was offered to us by people who actually lived the war in Europe, got their loved ones killed by it, by the neighbors
So, if they thought that becoming allies with said neighbors was the best thing to do, who are we, their spoiled children living in the XXIst century to deny this heritage ?
I'm glad to live in France, don't really care about the EU
Hell yes !!
Holy fuck yes
f r e e h e a l t h c a r e w a v e
Not at all, I like the idea but what it became is just awful
Euro is horrible, the way eu works without democracy and with awful lobbying is horrible, and imposing the exact same policy to 26 totally different states is totally horrible and antidemocratic
Absolutly no
I envy brits so much
Sounds up my view too
The EU is not perfect but it's pretty damn good
My opinion exactly, considering 80 years ago we were engulfed in complete war, the fact that the European Union exists is truly amazing, and I am so grateful for everything the union has done for Europe
Your feelings do not match reality
Can we swap ?

>Les auteurs de l'étude jugent que « des réformes structurelles sont nécessaires maintenant
Pour profiter de l'euro, la France doit suivre avec rigueur la voie de la réforme du président Macron ».
Plutôt sortir de l'EU que de suivre les réformes libérales """"""nécessaires""""""" de Macron
Yeah, most people here are really apathetic towards the EU (at least that's how I feel it), literally no feeling whatsoever, except when I can blame them for something, and I'm like that too
Wouldn't surprise me if we end up trying to leave eventually
Chacun juge des conclusions à tirer de cette étude

Fun fact
I've studied a fair bit of Irish in my home country before going for my Erasmus year in Ireland - Dublin, specifically
While I was aware of the situation, I did try my hand at basic stuff to start conversations and legit could not get a reply out of most people
I basically lived a limited (and self-aware) version of [Yu Ming is aimn dom] a short film about a Chinese kid who picks a new country to live in at random, lands on Ireland, and naturally decides to learn the language - Irish
He flies into Dublin, hilarity ensues
So like do you go "what's the scéal" or straight up "cad é an scéal"?
Ok one question that's always been bugging me is "taoiseach". I always heard it as "tee-shack". Can you confirm that I'm not insane and it should have a /x/ as final consonant, and that the entirety of the Irish media system (bar TG4) can't be arsed to pronounce it right
In France, we had the strikes with the "gilets jaunes" (yellow vests)
When we had terrorist attacks in Strasbourg, the gilets jaunes started believing and spreading the rumor that the government was behind this attack, and they did so to drag the attention somewhere else and make the population forget about them
The gilets jaunes (not all of course), truely believed that
The worst part is that they are so stubborn they forget that french civilians died this day, and all they thought about was their strike !
I had a friend who believed people on the government, and the rich generally speaking, were all part of pedophile, child-sacrificing rings
Frankly after the Epstein case, I'm tempted to believe he was at least partially right
Why do you think the tunnel was empty
Our government was in it the whole time
like sovereign citizens
It's not bad, I usually search the French one at first, and then look at the English version to see if there is more information
(Sometimes our version is even the more detailed one)
Lots of pages are direct translation from the English version
I generally use Wikipedia in French but when I read an article that seems to lack of details I take a look at the English or Spanish article
When it comes to chemistry I use it very rarely, English Wikipedia is way more complete
I use French Wikipedia for locally relevant topics, English Wikipedia for other topics
French Wikipedia is smaller and there's not as much quality control for this same reason
Some topics are subject to pseudoscientific content, and as an occasional editor, it's frustrating to see the number of affected pages, and vandalized pages as well
I almost exclusively use the french wikipedia
Only some very niche english topics that we don't know about in France aren't translated
Never use Wikipedia in another language if the article exists in French, it's often very well detailed
Cebuano wikipedia being autogenerated is so cool !
Sure
And I live near Vittel which is a pretty famous water brand so I have the same water quality as bottled water but without paying anything
It's also free in the restaurants, bars etc
Yes, some people prefer drinking bottled water though
Same in France
It's in fact illegal for a restaurant to make you pay for tap water
I almost never see people drinking bottled water though
Cold as fuck mountain water from a source is a godsend though while hiking
That is very cool
French system to enter med school is chaotic, but at the same time we lack doctors
They said they changed it, but in fact they just improved the reorientation after failing the "Concours".
I live in a part of France called "la diagonale du vide" (The empty stripe)
It roughly goes from the NorthEast of France to the West/South; this shape / . The population is decreasing in most cities and villages, and since there's not enough attractiveness/population there are no big universities or lots of job opportunities
My city has a nice history centre, and one of the universities here is starting to become more and more known, so I think it will become a student town eventually
There's no textile industry, or industry at all (except for small shops who do stuff themselves)
It's kind of depressing to think that I'll have to leave where I lived all my life to go to university and have a job in the field I want cause if I don't I'll get stuck
We're famous for our melons but most of the melons are not from this city
Propaganda from "non-political" group is getting out of hand
I suppose it's the same problem everywhere, ultra-anti-nuclear association pass false information on the subject everyday, animal right societies are backed by huge companies producing vegan meat
Today a high ranked member of a syndicate is more powerful than a elected parlementarian
I learned that for 50 years we had this :  which limit the number of medical student we can have each year
It's been removed last year
Today’s Europe is not yesterday’s Europe
And today’s Africa is not yesterday’s Africa
Things have changed dramatically and people are still stereotyping countries based on what they have heard long time ago
Where are you from ?
If you only know Paris, you might think that
but come to the south of France, then back to Paris, you'll see the Parisian-vibe is pure stress, hurry and sulking
I totally agree
I've lived all my life in the same place and people make me feel like a complete stranger
I travelled to many places and sometimes I had a bad experience, but most times I met wonderful people who gave my faith in humanity back
I believe there's a home somewhere for everyone who can afford moving there
Thank \*FUCK !
There it is
Finally ! I was disapointed not to read some Swedo-Danish wars in the comments so far !
There are only 4 cities in this list I've never heard of, 3 of them in Germany
They are:
- Bochum, Germany (364,628)
- Wuppertal, Germany (354,382)
- Bydgoszcz, Poland (346,739)
- Mannheim, Germany (309,370)
I've also never heard of Bielefeld, but it doesn't exist so it doesn't count
Bochum
I had never ever heard about this city before
Bachum
Litteraly never heard about it
But the population is by city limits so there are big cities that get far in the list
Bochum in Germany for me, although I know some Polish cities only by name and nothing else, like Lodz
As an aside I wanted to check which was the last city that I knew of on the list, but since Nantes is third from the end it was kinda moot, as I live fairly close to Nantes
Same for me
I think more people would recognize the name Stetin because of Churchill's iron curtain speech
As for Poznan, I am sorry, I only recognize the name because of the great duchy of Posen :(.
Bydgoszc
Never heard of it
The first rule of /r/europe is that Europe doesn't have an east side, only west and central
mhhh i would say that you should learn primarily vocabulary cause even though the grammar and the verb conjugating are wrong, it doesn’t matter because we will understand you and correct you
for the method, i would say don’t try to translate it (or just at the beginning to have the bases), try to learn as a baby learn to speak, by understanding the meanings of the words, but also their subtleties
also don’t learn only by hearing, you have to have a written support cause French is a written language and it’s necessary to understand the structure of a sentences because it’s peculiar
also, don’t put yourself to much pressure if you do some mistakes, even us can’t speak perfectly ahah
French often translates as the long + old english
english: "guess i'll eat mutton"
french: "je pense que je vais prendre le mouton" (i think that i will pick the mutton)
Don't feel bad if you can't write properly a word, or don't know how to perfectly conjugate a verb
It takes time, because French grammar is a nightmare
Learn how to pronounce stuff correctly, that's all you need to sound like a native
You just need time and patience and don’t force yourself into the grammar
Agreed neglecting the writings part would be a mistake: we accept more the speaking mistake than the written ones
Overall it's easier if you're a native Latin language speaker
Reading is probably a good idea to remember all the spelling
Spelling is the worst part, even for French people
also, I was talking to a friend of mine who is American and she told me that she was struggling to understand when French people are speaking French because she couldn’t distinguish the words since we talk fast and on a single « note », so learning by seeing the « cutting » of the words in a sentence will surely help when youhearasentencesaidlikethat
yes we do ! it’s called « une anagramme ». it can be done with a word or a sentence
it was not about spelling but it was understanding the cut of words when she would here a person talking
Like for example if I would say « Aujourd’hui j’ai été à la boulangerie » she would hear « Aujourdhuijaiétéàlaboulangerie ». so she wouldn’t understand what i was saying because she couldn’t understand each word
but when i was talking slower, she would understand
about French spelling, I wouldn’t say it’s that easy because there are a lot of different combinations for the same sound (é, ai, ait, ais, haie, est, è, ê, et
), verbs are faaaaaar from easy, even for us, there are also silent letters, exceptions
that’s why i recommend for someone who wants to learn French to start with writing and then pronouncing
but maybe you’re just natural :)
well the concept is not complicated
you take a word for example, and with the same letters that compose that word, you create another word
it’s not used everyday of course
it’s more like a sort of game
here’s an example from wikipedia: Le Marquis de Sade = Démasqua le désir = Marque des ladies
you see you have the exact same letters in every « sentence ». also you can use every letters as much as you want
well it’s always easier to learn a language when you are younger
and about the Nouvel Obs, sometimes even us look at verbs, they are so complicated
about the instagram page, the spelling is absolutely awful but it’s because it’s ironic, misspelled on purpose, don’t worry :)
in general i would say that we spell simpler on purpose (clearly not as much as in the instagram page, and not this way) on the internet with abbreviations etc
, and there’re also new words coming from English and Arabic languages mostly, or just made up, only used by younger generations
but in school professors tend to be severe on spelling (not only French teachers) for us not to write like that in the « real life » because misspelling is really not well seen in France and it can be disabling, even though we all know how hard our language is
well actually, even though it can be quite annoying sometimes, i think it’s necessary
we have a beautiful language so why ruining it ? :)
when you say all europeans then i guess you are talking about the citizens and not the governments in place
So here is my list (of course counter exemples can always be found):
* willing to keep our country specificities but be part of a federation
* Human right and democracy as a guiding principle
* Respect to the Occidental museum that Europe is
* willing to group to not let US/China/Russia rule the world without counterbalance
* FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Getting offended when someone from the US says he would love to go to Europe as if it was a country but also like to say they would love to go to Asia/Africa/America
Overall, nothing
There's nothing common enough in our culture, our language, our history to efficiently federate people
^(Not that history would be enough anyways
Come on, it's cheating to use the Balkans
Well, Denmark is notoriously bullish on European federalism
That being said, you're correct that it is a minority view, but certainly not one that is exclusive to the Internet
In fact, it's been present since the very start of the EEC
truth is that they will do as they want on the international scene ... we are diplomats and they don't care for diplomacy anymore
But in the long term, more countries will join our boat (the way we think, not joining EU) and hopefully this will pay off ... but before there will be more invasion/drama/stupidity making the news
What are some sentences every mothers from your country say
In France:
\- If you forgot to turn the light off: "It's not Versaille here
\- If you're hungry: "eat your hand, save the other one for tomorrow"
\- When you forgot to say please "what about the magical word
\- "Eat your carrots, it will make you amiable (variant : it will make your bottom pink)
\- If you pick your nose "do you want my finger
\- When you  yawn  "close your mouth, you'll eat a fly"
\- When you're uptset: "Cry, you will pee less".
"Tu veux mes doigts
Square eyes
the child version of me would have tryed
haha I like this one
Haha, I like it
haha, the one about being cold is so true, with my mother it was: if she feels cold, everyone must feel cold
That's really interesting
thanks for sharing
haha
If you want to add a flag, go to r/AskEurope, then at the right, below "create post" clic on community options, "user flair preview" then select a flag

I love romanian mothers hahaha
here it's more a grand mother thing
Mothers are more "stop eating
" or "did you gain weight
hahaha I guess your feeling it correct
French mother also used that one ;)
I’ve never check so this might just be a legend, but
In France you can’t name a pig Napoleon
Because of the emperor
In France, it's forbidden to name your pig "Napoléon" and it's mandatory to have a haystack in your garden in case the king comes in your street with his horses
No, this law has never been abrogated
Hi, France here
And we can't name a pig Napoleon, so yeah
In France , it is forbidden to name your pig "Napoleon".
In France, alcohol isn't allowed at work, except wine, cider, beer, and perry (pear cider with very few producers)
The weird things are that wine, beer and cider represent like 80% of alcohol consumption here, and that perry is produced by a couple of cider producers
So idk how it was added to the law
Women forbidden to wear trousers until very recently
It is a law from the Code Civil written under the ruling of Napoléon 1st
Therefore, it is outdated and certainly not applied but true
In the same code was the law forbidding women to wear anything else than a dress
I don't remember if this one is still in the law or has been ditched recently
C'est pas une légende il me semble
In Animal Farm, I believe that the pig is thus named "César" (Caesar) for this exact reason
Edit: Not 1984
>It is legal to cook dogs for private consumption
I understand now why you have so many Chinese tourists
We have the same in France, it's about 125 euros a year and you have to pay it as long as you have a TV screen in the house
They talked about changing it to any screen as some people would buy a huge computer screen and use them as TV to avoid the tax
I was super happy about such a tax for the same reasons many people in other countries are (free medias not controlled by the government, much more intellectual programs than on private channels etc
However, I feel like French public TV has become part of the government propaganda agenda and is not as free as they used to be
Which makes me angry to pay for a government's propaganda I don't support
Anyway, when this works correctly, 125euros a year is not a high price to pay for free media
Mon oncle a essayé une fois
Il a pris perpet
Faut pas déconner avec ça
It was only in Paris, and it was abrogated in 2013
J'ai plus vu de jupe depuis un bail donc je pense que t'es pas trop d'actualité et hors-sujet cher ami
IIRC it was ditched one or two years ago
And it just forbid them to wear pants without authorization from their husband or father if unmarried
I has been officially ditched in 2013, but was no longer unforced before that
Also, it accepted exceptions
Tant mieux, c’en est encore plus drôle !
We flew a kite in a public place
French is a nightmare for that
Vert = green
Vers = near/close to   or verse poem
Verre = glass
Ver =  worm
All are got the same pronounciation
Most of words in french arn't exactly pronounce like they are writen if your not familiar with the writing (like the rule ai is prononuce è), or can mean differents things if you still pronounce it the same but change the spelling
We got a lot of silence letters also
also for exemple the sound "ssss" ca be writen  "ss" or "ç", "c"or "t" depending of the word, it's like this for many sound: The sound "ey" can be writen "ai", "è", "et" or  "ei".
No, because we have multiple ways of writing the same sound
*O*, *au*, *eau* for example
There are still a few rules (for example very low probability of seeing a word end by "o", it's almost always "au" and "eau"), and you can often guess based on other words with similar roots, but it's not always the case :
Gold is *or*, but gold mining is "exploitation *aur*ifère", both words come from latin *aurum* but somehow one ended up with *o* and the other with *au*.
Lots of spellings are just arbitrary lile that
Basically, if you know the rules you can pronounce any word you read, but you can't write any word you hear
French words are pronounced as they are written, it's just that there are 4 million ways to spell the same sound
But any of those 4 million ways is pronounced the same, so there's that
Yeah but I mean, if you're not bad in French you remember perfectly how 99% of the words are written even with all our silent letters
Also s'en sent sans cent
French has arcane rules, but at least it has them, unlike some pseudo-Germanic languages I can think of
The answer to the question the OP is asking is yes, for me, as long as it's not a proper noun
Cause those are truly crazy - de Broglie comes to mind
God I wish that were me
English native but lived most of my life in France
The reason it’s consistent is because at some point in history France got really fed up with the fact that everybody spoke/wrote how they wanted so they introduced the “Académie Française” which standardised the language
So it’s an odd language which has a bunch of weird quirks dating from the 17th century but at least it’s remained consistent since then
English on the other hand is constantly evolving but is simpler
Don't forget "aient"
Stupid old anglais
Ez, er and é soud the same but are different from aiz and ait, onlyh people from the south because of their accent and some from the far north pronounce it the same way
that's the point, you need to learn the rules
Don't worry, it can be a nightmare for us too
De broglie is a noble french family but was italian (from Piemont) at first so i think that they don't pronounce the g so it sounds like "de bro-i" and it sounds more like de Breuil
That's my theory tell me if i am wrong i'd like to know what the hell happened with that name
I mean that, we have silent letters and such but we're pretty consistent in term of pronunciation and use of said silent letters
In the example the first guy posted, we have all the different forms of "ver" but they're all pronounced the same just with different meanings and spellings, if English had a word like that, it'd be an absolute clusterfuck where the "e" would be pronounced differently in every single meaning of the word in addition to random silent letters, like the whole though, through thing
French has silent letters but there is a pattern to it
Yeah but it's way less random
Yeah, that's probably it
But the first time I had an oral exam and said de Bro-gue-lie and my teacher laughed and corrected me, I genuinely wondered if he was just punking me
The throne
We've also got the extremely classy "chiotte"... which just means "shitter
There's also an proverb which sounds a little bit similar to the one OP gave: "Sur le plus haut trône du monde, l'homme n'est toujours assis que sur son cul" (On the highest throne in the world, one is still only sitting on their ass)
Not totally sure it's related to the toilet "throne", but I've always pictured a king shitting for that one
Ah yes, a man of refined taste, I see
Écureuil, quincaillerie
Came in handy during a "try to pronounce this
" game when I was doing a student exchange
sadly it was a French-German exchange
"Curieux" is always a good one, as it combines U, R and a i sound right after
I had a uni professor who had been living in the country for 25 years who still struggled with that one
Another would be "chirurgien urologue", same seasons as above and also has a nasal vowel
Écureuil is definitely the one we have the most fun with
Works nicely on the flip side too, because a lot of French folk have a hard time pronouncing the English equivalent, squirrel
My gf is polish, she showed me this movie with Grzegorz
I try to learn polish, but sometimes it's nearly impossible haha
Even the letters ś and ć are challenging to say :(
My favorite from my czech class was "strc prst skrz krk" (missing the accent on the "c")
It also works in slovak too
Grenouille or garage are great
And grenouille is quite fitting for us frogs
Or worse, "serrurerie".
yeah, *him* haha
I think I say it well sometimes, but it's still difficult
I think Italians may have an easier time with polish pronunciation than French ^^
I've heard this before but it's quite easy to pronounce
'squi (as in squish) - rull (as in pull)'
In Marseille, calling your friends Fra or Frate has become a trend a few years back
Of course it comes from Italian
Other common way, at national level this time, is to call your bro, "gros". Means fat
But applies just to anyone
I call them "frère" (bro), "mec" (dude) or sometimes "bg" (pronounce "bégé, short for "beau gosse", literally handsome man but the expression kinda lost it's meaning nowadays, especially on Twitter)
This is fun
I call my friends "mec" or "meuf" basically dude for male and dude for female
Gros (fat), frère (brother), bg (beau gosse=handsome guy), mec (guy)
Mec (dude), meuf (girl), poto (friend), frère (brother), gros (fat)
I think the most generally known one are "mec" (mate) , some people use "frère" (brother)
We personally call ourselves "Michel" , even the ladies
I tend to call my friends or my brother "vieux" (old), too
It heavily depends on the socio-cultural background and age, but here in a little provincial town "mec" is by far the most used on a day-to-day basis
We also use "gros" but I think it's falling out of fashion for people under 30yo
Yes I guess because about 1/3 of Marseille population is of italian descent (including me)
Tio, que pasada
Jejeje
In France we have BG (beau gosse) which means the same
According to this wikipedia page, there are about 300,000 people of italian descent, 300,000 of corsican descent, and 200,000 of north african descent
In Brittany, LOTS of our folklore is linked to Wales and Cornwall
I guess it's because our languages were very close
Sometimes, it is also about Ireland and Scotland
Here is my favorite myth, a combinaison of Atlantis and mairmaid !
In the early days of Christianity the city of Ys, or Ker-Ys, was the richest trading port in the Atlantic
Ships and merchants from south and north came to the Bay of Douarnenez in south-west Brittany to buy and sell luxury goods
The city was rich and lively, but it was also too much given to lust and sin as to arouse the ire of Breton Saint Gwenole, who foretold the city’s ruin
The city of Ys was ruled by the king Gradlon, who was also the king of Cornwall
He was a religious and pious man who was grieved by the shameful behaviour of the city and of his wayward daughter, the princess Dahut
The city of Ys was protected from the ocean by a strong dyke and by a gate built into the dyke to take the outflowing tidal water, and only king Gradlon alone possessed the key to the gate
One night, while king Gradlon was sleeping, princess Dahut stole the key from his father for the purpose of opening the city gate for her lover, a demon
As she opened the gate, the ocean immediately rushed in and submerged rapidly the wicked city
As the city was being destroyed by the water, Saint Gwenole commanded king Gradlon to flee
He mounted his horse Morvarc’h and took his daughter Dahut behind him, with the incoming flood about to submerge them
Gwenole further commanded king Gradlon to throw the demon he was carrying into the sea
Gradlon hesitated but he finally obeyed the Saint
As Dahut was thrown off his horse into the water, king Gradlon managed to escape and save his life
After the city of Ys was destroyed, king Gradlon moved to the city of Quimper and kept a low profile for the rest of his life
As to his daughter Dahut, she was changed into a mermaid and was condemned to sing her remorse forever in the bay of Douarnenez, where she loved and feasted
Popular folklore tells that she often appears to fishermen, combing her long golden hair and luring sailors to their doom
It is also believed that when the sea is calm one can hear the bells of the church of Ys ringing from the depths of the bay
> I guess it's because our languages were very close
Same [ancestry]
new years eve
and the 14 of july thats when the revolution took over a prison and got weapons, it's our national holiday
And the 15th of August (the Assumption)
Battle named "Le chemin des dames" in WW1, a french officer was captured some days before the attack with complete plans of the offensive, date and place of bombing, etc
Nivelle attacked without caring
~~Napoleon~~ Murat advancing casually towards the enemy with a big smile and his arms wide open as if peace had been signed so the enemy didn’t fire at his men and him as they crossed the bridge, only to charge them as soon as the bridge was crossed
It was such a crazy bet
Also Charles VI a mad king who sometimes had episodes where he attacked anyone he saw in a murderous rage and had to be physically restrained, in some cases after he killed several of his own me
This king also thought he was made of glass and demanded to be carried in a special cushioned container
Honestly, 2010 French football team "strike" was kinda cringe
The government actually payed salves owners for the losfrom the abolition of slavary, and since slaved didnt get any help they had to get employed by their previous owner which would jsut pay them enought to buy food
Sorry for the spelling and all
Not history but 2 guys 4 years ago tried to rob a McDonald's. Turns out they picked the wrong one because there was 11 GIGN elit soldiers eating there
The GIGN is specialized in intervention and anti terrorist/hostage situations
To be fair it was the usual Nivelle battle plan : rush enemy machine gun emplacements until they run out of bullets or we run out of bodies, it was not really a problem even if they knew everything
Getting England, France and Germany to get along smooth is hell of an achievement
Didn't she once claim that Iran and Pakistan were in the EU
Sounds like classic 14-18 warfare
Excuse me, king Edward VII with his mysterious sex chair and resident room in a Paris brothel
It was during the Franco-Dutch War and it was just two german states allied to France that invaded them in 1672 actually (Cologne and Munster I think)
The two states then left the war in 1673 when the HRE led by Austria as well as Spain entered it on the side of the Dutch haha
England was allied to France as well and was supposed to invade by sea but after several naval defeats at the hands of the Dutch left the war in 1674, leaving France facing a coalition from 1674 to the end of the war in 1678 . That whole thing was a shitshow and you would have expected Louis XIV to chill out once we got a fairly good deal out of that war but no
the fucker was again embroiled in the Nine Years' War against an even bigger coalition after having annexed the entirety of Alsace, which started France's financial problems, made even worse by his revocation of the edict of Nantes
What pisses me off the most about Louis XIV is that he didn't even lose any of his wars, but the gains for France were never worth the amount of money and ressources spent
Louis XIV managed to both be the greatest king in french history and one of the worst as well at the same time
Making France the most powerful political, cultural and military power in Europe while at the exact same time leaving it on the brink of bankrupcy by the time of his death
I don't even know why I am ranting right now
the dude just infuriates me lmao
Good catch, it was Murat indeed
New Caledonia isn't accessible without a visa if you aren't French or Kanak
Our border with Spain changes every 6 months
We even have a Spanish village within France
Also we border Suriname, Brazil and the Kingdom of the Netherlands
Piggy-backing this one for France:
Longest border with another country : brazil
Longest domestic flight : 12 hours to la reunion, south of Madagascar
Largest EEZ in the World
Largest number of Time zones of any countries
World's most productive workers (we work less but get more done during our work jours)
Those are thé one i Can think of on the top of my mind
I didn't even knew about this
Wait, what
I've never seen a kiwi from Italy nor from China, in France all our kiwis come whether from France or New-Zealand
Wanted to check it out, got a good laugh
And our longest labd border is with brazil
Ah ! Interesting ! I get to ask you the questions I always asked myself about this place
Are all people there bilingual ? Do you try to get most of your chores (groceries and all) done in Spain or it doesn't matter as much ? Do some people work in France ? How did it work before Schengen to go from Spain to France and then Spain again ? Do people feel isolated from the rest of Spain ?
Muchas gracias !
Hey, I'm from not too far from there on the French side (Prades, if it rings a bell
Ah yes, I always forget about this one !
Exactly
My lazy ass thanks you for taking the time to source this
Haha France better
We have [Maripasoula] which is 18000 km^2 wide but has only 13000 inhabitants
Very interesting,  thank you for your answer !
You do ! I've always wondered how it feels like to live there
Do you do things mostly on the French side (grocery shopping etc) or do you go to Spain for it ?
Before Euros, in France we had Francs, and 1€=7 francs, so a "franc" cent was even cheaper than a cent of euro, and before 2002, there were some cheap things like candies sold for a few "francs" cents
So it was quite logical to have 1 and 2 cents euro coins with prices like that
However, prices got higher and higher and now we don't need those coins anymore
Wait wait wait, is France and Germany the only country to pay the exact price
Like I flabbergasted when I meant people in Ireland and other countries round it up
Like, even if I know 1,99 is the same as 2 and the 0,99 is only here to make me think that it's cheaper, in the end there is no reason for me to pay more than what is demanded
Also people seem to think that the only way to pay 1,99 is to give exactly 0,99 cents when here everyone will just give directly 2€ and the cashier will just have to give you 1 cent back
It's just quicker
Edit: I'd like to say that I'm not against removing them, but prices must adapt to end with a 0 or a 5
But as long as prices will be 0,99 there's not a chance for us to pay more than the price of the object/service
But, but, but, WHY would we lose money
If the price is 1,99€ and you give a coin of 2€ the cashier will give you one cent back
I don't understand your problem
In France there are three types of *Catholic (edit, as there are other Boy Scouts too) Boy Scouts: the European Boy Scouts are not officially recognized, as they are too
military/far right/conservative
I guess it’s not the same in all groups but yeah, that’s how we usually imagine them to be
Then they are the SUF (Scouts unitaires de France - United scouts of France), they ressemble your scouts when it comes to the age of the « chefs » (18-25 years old) and to games
We have to take part in the games, though, and would not leave in the middle of it
But we are quite close to them (I would not speak of my love problems with one of them but then, neither do I with most of my friends and family so it might just be me)
Finally there are the SGDF (Scouts et guides de France - Scouts and ... scoutess ? Girl Scouts of France)
They are the only ones including girls in the name, though all three types of scouts have girls groups, because they are the only one with mixed groups
They are the most progressive ones, and the bigger organization: the SUF tend to work by church, whereas the SGDF work by church and are connected France-wide
I’d say that they are similar to your scouts
Both SUF and SGDF have scouts names (I don’t know about the others, they might) but they are usually kept secret
They can be that of an animal or that of a flower
The secret and ritualistic part is truer among the SGDF than among the SUF: I was a SUF and my name was given to me in front of the whole group, for example
And we have the same names as you do, the little boys are "louveteaux" (little wolves), and the group is called a pack (la meute)
Girls names are different (jeannettes)
Sorry for long comment
There are a lot more than just 3 types of Scouts in France
Even considering only the French Scoutism Federation, there are 6 types : SGDF (as you described, and by far the largest group), EEUdF, EEdF, SMF, EEIF, EdlN
Regarding the scouts name, it depends a lot on the group : many of them do not give such names anymore
FYI : "guide" is called
"guide" in english ;)
I think that the religious link is more prevalent in France, or at least it is seen as such
Scouts are definitely something I associate with Conservative, upper-class catholics with a closeted military fetish
I have learned that its not the case for all scouting groups, but they are certainly less mainstream than in other countries I think
>rom the USA but on an exchange year in The  Netherlands, and I do scouting in both countries
I find the responses a bit funny because my experiences have been the complete opposite
As a USF i dont really consider SF as "whimps", i just see their movement as more accessible to the general public whereas ES & USF are more religious and have more "paramilitary" tendencies
The later vary greatly by troops or by groups but is usually a lot more prevalent than in Scouts of France groups
These tendencies can be really fun and motivating and have lots of positive aspects, but i understand why they're not for everyone
IMO the diversity of movement is great because it allows for different kind of people to get different kind of experiences
As scouts were introduced in France by a catholic priest, the vast majority of scouts are catholics
But our country is increasingly secular and having the biggest group of scouts be more relax about religion or inherent paramilitary background of scoutism makes it accessible and fun for a broader audience
Thanks for the info
I did not know of the other groups, will look them up :)
And thanks for the English term, it really was bothering me
Some people answered to my comment to remind me not to forget about Jewish and Muslim scouts and I’m glad they did
I know other scouts exist, but I do by reflex associate them with Catholicism (as I was in a catholic scout group)
I really don't think scouts were introduced in France by a catholic priest
In the early years, scoutism was even denounced by the catholic church while some guys (including a few pastors) created many groups and founded the EdF and EUF !
SMF  = Scout Musulmans de France and the eclaireurs are laics
I knew I was forgetting something
There are indeed Muslim and Jewish scouts in France, and I guess that there are Protestant scouts too, and probably others
Sorry for the omission, I chose to only speak of those I know and forgot to say this
Thanks for the reminder
There are some, especially in southern France
The [Maison Carrée] is one of the famous ones
Very well preserved
Hmmm, let me check, but I think we might have one or two
The region I'm from has [one of the best preserved roman theatres] just a few hundred meters from [a triumphal arch]
Also this big triumphal arch in my city : [Porte de Mars]
Bordeaux has some ruins of a Roman Amphitheater, le Palais Gallien
Les arènes de Nîmes :
Same here
There was a construction site near my HS where they discovered a column, the entire site stayed empty with just the column standing for like 2 years
Lots of money must have been wasted (for the construction guys, still cool for museums and stuff I guess
Can’t believe I didn’t think of that one
Most reknown by far :)
And in Nîmes [this is considered the best preserved Roman amphitheater in the world]
Grew up near Orange and went to middle and high school there, I was hoping to see it mentionned in the comments :)
Edit: if you're in the area and interested in Roman ruins, you also have to go to [Vaison-la-Romaine] nearby

I know all the goddamn lyrics by heart
I think France is a pretty good place for electronic / tech music
So I'd say Le Wanski - Tarte à la myrtille
Good music for late parties when everyone is either dead or dying
Ha ha fucking hell I forgot about that one
Otherwise there's always a bit of Philippe Katerine
I don't know think you can get a more portuguese song than Quim Barreiros xD Plus the songs always make me smile with how silly the lyrics are most of the time xD
Well, TIL I guess, didn't know that
Maybe something like "we have the most superior bread". Anything else may cause massive rioting
Almost everyone hates Macron, whether you're right or left
And I think it's beautiful
Must tell you about a thread on /r/France we had a few years ago about the french living abroad
They were all telling us their expériences and the pros and cons of the country they were living in
2 things came out every goddamn time that you can say that every french agrees on definitely :
- Everyone abroad is nice, more than french people
- Everywhere they eat shit and our food is better
I, personaly, only lived in England abroad, so I can agree on those statements, but it's way too easy to talk about the british cuisine
username checks out
France is good candidate
We’ve never agreed on anything except for the most basic things about our culture
No he is actually more popular than Hollande at the same period with about 30% of favorable opinions
The way French politics work is simple:
1) Elect a guy
2) Immediately hate him for no real reason
3) Ask for his resignation 2 weeks after he was elected
I don’t think there is any counter example in the recent history
Edit: typos, numbers
If a presidential election was held right now he would be re-elected
Even some of us French agree
You agree on something wrong
Pretty much the same when I went to Germany
Schwarzbrot ? Oh fuck no
It's ok though because you have Bretzels
Well of course he still is, he isn't going to resign on his own will, it's France, the Republic with the president with the most power in the world
People don't let their power go in a snap
Any dish where you add "English" in front becomes automatically disgusting
I mean, we have so many cheese, if you don't think that a French one is better than the one you prefer, it's most probably because you haven't heard of it yet
Na, so far I've always clocked my countrymen after one sentence max
That accent
Yes
Just once, while me and my friends were in London
We were at a coffee shop, the waiter started to take our order in english, we only spoke a few words or sentences until he asked in French if we were French as well though
We French people tend to have quite a thick accent
Yes, it has
Pretty much inevitable
No awkward moment followed, though, just peals of laughter !
Yeah once
I was travelling in Mexico with my girlfriend, we had rented a room in a guesthouse owned by a family
We started doing check in and he asked where we were from, soon as I answered he said "oh I'm French too". Turns out he was even from the same city as I was, had married a Mexican woman and came to live in the country
The only time I had struggle to spot a fellow french man, he had the double nationality franco-english
Except that, it's extremly easy
Our accent is thick :/
Clothes, the accent, the attitude and topics of conversation
The French can't hide
mais tellement
them : élo ! awaryou ?
me : oui, bonjour !
Porch pirates is not really a problem because we have no porches
Seriously either you live in an urban area and then you are living in an appartment, or you are living in a less densely populated area and then you may have something similar to American subburbs with cookie cutter houses
But, we have locked mailboxes
So either the package fits and the mailman leaves it in your mailbox, or if it's too big, he is supposed to ring your doorbell and hand it to you
If you are not there (or he has no time/willingness to ring), he will leave a notice saying your parcel will be available at the post office for pick up from next day
In a nutshell, unless you are living in a rural, safe area, the mailman will not leave your parcel outside
The real issue is parcels getting "lost" while going through sorting centers
This happens a little too often
Here they live the package on doorstep ONLY if you ask for
You also have to possibility to ask them to deliver it to your neighbours (and you have to tell wich one)
If you have a normalized mailboxe, then it's big enough for a regular package and every deliver man have a key
When they arrive they often call you, ask if you're at home, if not they would just do what you ask for: live it on the porch for exemple
If they don't call you and you gave no instruction they will come back the day after
You also have the option to live it at a nearbye shop
Not that I’m aware of, here in France the deliverers has been practicing the art of pretending you’re not here to not deliver your package and piss off your entire day
No package and thus no theft
I sometimes find mine left on top of the locked mailbox if it doesn’t fit, even pre-Covid but more so now
My neighbours could easily steal it but I’m from a sleepy village that’s pretty much just old people and I doubt any of them have much interest in stealing my stuff
I’ve never had a problem with that or heard of anybody else having
>unless you are living in a rural, safe area, the mailman will not leave your parcel outside
OH the innocence
Many will leave the parcel outside in a urban area, where it will quickly be stolen
I swear Hermes only ever leave my parcels in the paper recycling on bin day     I got a message from them last week saying they’ve successfully delivered my parcel and the proof of delivery was a photo of a bemused looking old lady holding my Debenhams order in the doorway of a house that I don’t even recognise
Yes, it happens a lot around me
I’m lucky there’s a guy in charge of all packages in my apartment building, because lots of my friends have experience with stolen packages
Well with the covid contactless stuff, yes
Behind the joke, I meant we have different demographics, different urban layouts, and different housing types, which makes the porch pirate american phenomenon much much less acute
Porched houses are not very common
At least it is not the staple urban or even suburban architecture like it is in the US
Like, we might have a small roof right over the external doors but it’s only a tiny bit of token shelter
As for those big, elevated, even wrap-around porches: I’ve only ever seen them in American TV
Eindhoven in the Netherlands
Left Breda for a job there, boy did I ever so regret that decision
Issoudun , France
Saint-Etienne
Sure it’s a fairly large french city, but it is very Soviet to me
Large apartment complexes, lots of dead industry, unfriendly people, and it’s not very clean
People from Paris make the city seem artificial and soulless, it has history, but current Paris is a pretty but hollow shell
I passed through Belgrade via the highway, it was quite disturbing all this brutalist architecture and the ugly double concrete tower
I love Sofia !
Yes, but the interesting thing is love is that while it can cherish even the most minute things, there must be still be something to love
A small brook near my home means far more to me than to a stranger, but there's still a charm point
It must be theoretically possible to have homes which outright discourage emotional value
the old town is quite cute
Make sure you order “poisson” (fish) at the restaurant, and not “poison” (poison)
Not in my language but my mom always told me of that time in Germany in his friend family when her mom said
* Die Nudeln sind fertig : The pastas are cooked
* Die Judeln sind fetig : The Jews are cooked
My mom was in panic for a moment until she undertood
Not a letter but a coma
"On bute, karadoc" (we're stuck, karadoc)
"On bute karadoc" (we kill karadoc)
I was going to say the letter ‘e’. It may not be a fish or death situation, but you also do not want to get genders confused
Merci beaucoup Vs Merci beau cul
Thank you very much Vs Thank you beautiful ass
That's in most languages though, for example in English "we have ended, karadoc
" vs "we have ended karadoc
" ("on a fini, karadoc" vs "on a mis fin à karadoc")
I'd say we can have pretty different outcomes with some misplaced accents but we'll usually still get the original meaning depending on context
Not exactly
"J'en n'ai plus" is the correct spelling
The correct formal version would be "Je n'en ai plus", not "J'en n'ai plus". But we drop the *ne/n'* in informal speech so they become the same, except for the pronunciation of the ending *s*.
In France public university is free
However private schools are expensive
Problem is, the best schools are mostly in Paris and living there is very expensive
Public universities are free in France but for the private ones it's between 200 and 10000€ per year
Public universities are free in France but there is a kind of tax ( CVEC ) for students, so it’s 90 euros a year actually
Aside, if you are from modest families you can be housed in a CROUS building for a very small rent, and there is such buildings next to almost every universities, and anyway you have an help from the state for this rent ( APL ) wich is ~220 euros every month + a another one ( bourse ) if you come from a poor family
What is cheaper in your country than in the rest of Europe
Probably baguettes, around 80-90 € cents
Internet access and a phone plan
I would say electricity !
Wine, cheese, vegetables and fruits, charcuterie
The cheapest places you can find are markets with local products basically
Bread is super cheap too
And waffles
Can't imagine waffles being sold for 2€ on the streets here in France
Internet maybe and shitty wine/beer
And cigarettes and alcohol
A lot of pubs and bars or regular people in the south of France go to Spain to buy alcohol
Alcohol in bars and outside of bars, cigarettes are way cheaper than in France
Around the same price here in France, I pay 12€ for 60gb unlimited calls SMS MMS etc
You need a new low cost internet provider to shake up the market
In France, prior to the creation of "Free", we were just being screwed over by the other 3 main providers
It's mostly due to the low quality of food
Almost US-bad quality
Yes definetly, It's just that Spain is really close and you don't risk being controlled as much
Especially if you are coming from Eastern Europe, they control you for cigarettes and alcohol since a lot of people buy it ridiculous quantities and resell
Well some essentials : 6 eggs for around 1€ in the small stores (not the best quality) fruits and vegetables are ridiculously expensive if you buy it in supermarkets 3€ for an avocado where I live
Milk is like 1€ per litre
Wine starts around 1€ per 75cl and around 5-6 for a decent wine
Alcohol is cheaper than in Belgium but not in pubs
Meat prices really vary
Sometimes 6€ for 1kg of chicken sometimes 12€. Restaurants from my experience were cheaper in the Netherlands
No way you can get a good meal in a touristic area in France for a reasonable price( apart from fast food obv)
> It's mostly due to the low quality of food
Almost US-bad quality
I would have to disagree with you there, though to be fair, I buy mostly fresh food products in both the UK and France
Veg prices are similar, but meat and dairy prices in the UK are cheaper (for free-range chicken and eggs, pork filet, mainly)
I can even get President butter and French cheese brands cheaper in the UK than in France
One thing that is noticeably more expensive in France is fresh milk
Fuck that paying double the price for fresh milk v UHT in France
Tinned foods are usually cheaper in the UK (tomatoes, chickpeas, etc
) and I've yet to find a French supermarket Indian curry that tastes vaguely 'Indian', so I don't bother any more
Mix it with rice
Wtf, what kind of heathen are you
j/k, but I've NEVER heard of that
TIL
Tbh I only have beans on toast, with fish fingers and chips or with a fry-up
Definitely, they scare my girlfriend, but they soothe me, I can remain stucked, my nose on a window looking at them, and the sound of thunder helps me fall asleep
It's one of my favourite thing and a large part why I'm moving back south as soon as I can
I do because i'm then happy as fuck to be inside in my bed

Welcome in France ! Through against, it is closed for the month, here
This is how it goes if I stanslate word by word

Ah, I see you havent given up on the proud Norwegian tradition of greeting your neighbors with an axe when visiting them !
Heeeeeey ! An English(wo)man speaking our language flawlessly ! What a sight to see ! :)
"Tu m'casses les couilles
Potentially, we have wolves & brown bears on land, sharks & jellyfish in the sea & ocean
In terms of numbers, I couldn't find any data for France, but according to estimates, the top 3 are : wasps/bees (allergic reactions, a dozen per year), dogs (attacks, less than 10 per year), and deers/boars (road collisions, less than 10 per year)
I'm sure there are super dangerous snake/insects/spider/puma/crocodile in Guyane
But I'm not an expert on the subject
We also have scorpions in Southern France
The black ones are only painful (think wasp), but the yellow ones are dangerous
I think they're mainly found in the PACA region, not much elsewhere
Is that where you live
In France (in parenthesis is a parallel in a IT Company) :
President : in charge of deciding on directions the country will go
(Champion or Sponsor)
Ministers : translate those directions into smaller and practical bits (Project Managers)
Senators/Deputies : role is to come up with practical laws/rules to support those Directions (Developers)
In France the PM is chosen by the president to form and lead the government
The president is also in exclusive charge of France's foreign policy (like deciding to go to war)
As such the French president is the chief of the armies
In case of a major security crisis for the nation (ie when the Republic is in danger), the president can call a special session of the parliament and invoke article 16 of the French constitution to obtain the full powers for a renewable period of six months
It only happened once, by Charles de Gaulle during the Algeria War
In most european country, the power is held by a prime minister/chancellor/president of council/other, with a superior entity above that is essentially symbolic, like a president or a king/queen
An exception is France, where the President has actual powers (many powers in fact) and the prime minister is more of an “““aide””” (with massive quotes) that is in charge of coordinate the government according to the policy decided by the president
Lol "only by Merkel". I'd like being greeted by Merkel
I'm never greeted by anyone when I go to Germany
I will just add something to the last one: sénateurs and députés from the same colour as the government are doing that, the role of the opposition is a counter power
Not a thing in France
Most people don’t notice, and flags had been out of fashion for a time: flying one roughly meant “yeah, I’m nationalist af
” for some times, so usually not very pro-Europe
(This changed in 2015, after terrorist attacks flying the flag became more “normal” again)
Flags aren't really a thing here, so no
Also, I don't know if it's me being stupid, but I didn't know there was a Europe Day so
It's not a thing at all, I doubt that anyone except institutions have a European flag
Even french flags are not so used it July 14th
Only far right political fans and maybe sport fans use it
I don't know anyone with a flag
Never heard of this date, never have seen any EU flag on a house and ofc I won't do it
Same in Paris
French flags on the 8th (VE Day), European flags on the 9th
That's sad but it's true, nowadays flying a french flag or like having it in your twitter name (or worse, on your property like an American redneck) has become a nationalist/racist thing
Shouldn't be the case but they really ruined it
(Amongst other stuff, thinking about viking symbols etc)
La Haine for France

There's so much of them
I would recommend Mauvais Sang by Leos Carax
I would've said something by Louis de Funès
I watched this movie once and cried so much I can't bring myself to watch it again
Luxembourg to get the list of tax evaders
Plus, they open black holes on a daily basis, so who knows how many alien civs they already contacted through them

If you had to chose one european head of government or president to replace yours, who would you pick ?
Let's pick only politicians that are in place as we speak
Merkel is the obvious choice, though she has to be nearing the end of her career at this point and is obviously not perfect
but I don't know who i would prefer in the current crop, among those I'm familiar with anyway
Honestly just take Macron out
I don’t even care at this point
I’m hesitant between Angela Merkel and Giuseppe Conte
So we dislike Macron's stance but we want Merkel
She would get gilets jaunes style riots in less time than Macron tbh
Hell no anyone but Merkel
She’s the main reason why the immigration crisis was such a disaster and in that situation cared more about the immigrants than her people
I love your 2
Made me chuckle
So the honeymoon phase is over and done, right ?
a) some people are conservative, even though it's probably not the majority around here given Reddit demographics
b) a moderate conservative who's competent and honest still seems pretty good
I mean what are our other options
Why do you think Merkel is a bad pick ? It's true that she has an aura of being the "perfect" politician seen from abroad, though many German dislike her
Mutti is a childish way to say mum if I'm not mistaken
Well yeah, if you're a far-right nativist, obviously Merkel is no good for you
Which is precisely why I like her
Who's your pick, Orban
Johnson
Lmao being against mass immigrations = being a nazi, that's what you mean ?
>  It's true that she has an aura of being the "perfect" politician seen from abroad
Lmao
You just speak for yourself
Well, Merkel isn't actually as lax on immigration policy as nativists like to claim
She took the initiative in that direction and no one followed, including social democrats as you mention, and since then she hasn't been that bold in that department
To be fair that’s what this kind of thread lead to
Like, there are a lot of people here idolizing Macron for the EU stuff but actually he’s corrupted as hell ( Alstom scandal, Ferrand scandal, weird presidential party, coronavirus outbreak management etc ) and has been elected without programm litteraly but people glorify him here as well
About Orban/Salvini I don’t care, we have the equivalent in our opposition and she is laaaaame
But I do care about mass immigration and its consequences yea
I like that the pronunciation is completely fucked, it makes it more like a mysterious language only the worthy can know
The swears are very great, always a joy to swear loudly in French
I love the translation of The Sorting Hat from Harry Potter
Choixpeau
Choix = choice
Chapeau = hat
Mix together and one obtains choixpeau !
The sassiness you can get from normal words, and the power of insults
Also, as a French, you suffer from learning it at school, so all the latin languages are easier to learn and you also are more used to have a hard time writing or conjugating in another language
We've got an informal word that means "to slap one's face with one's penis". The word is "une bifle" and it's the contraction of "une bite" (a dick) and "une gifle" (a slap)
I love the reaction people have when I tell them this fun fact
I'm also looking at us don't worry
I'm pulling my hear at the way we write our language
Especially you PH, I'm talking about you
Italians are always worthy, unlike some others I won't mention but rhymes with Dickland
Wait, what is a portemanteau ? The name of the hat ?
Ohhh ok thank you
On top of my mind:
Frog legs, snails, some (old) cheeses, "pieds et paquets" (guts and pork foot bones)
*Steak tartare* which is seasoned raw beef
Hmmm, a lot ! Let's start with the all so famous snails or the frog legs
They are delicious btw
Any meal that has innards or from other organs like "andouillette" and "rognon". Pig legs, pig nose, pig ears and everything in the pig
Strong and smelly cheese
We eat everything there is, french cuisine is not just defined by high class gourmet stuff
Oh yeah and tongue, that's good too but only when it's served hot
Some of our cheese
Even here, most people aren't big fans of "strong cheese," like bleu, roquefort or maroilles
And frogs and snails
I love the raw herring you can buy in the street in The Netherlands
I've never heard of pieds et paquets before, is it a regional dish
Not only isn't Gravlax disgusting, it's a fucking great delicacy
that’s freaking delicious ! but i wouldn’t eat it during hot summer or at dinner or somewhere i don’t know
this is kind of a risky meal but definitely worth it
Haha :) Did you enjoy this "quail"?
Wow
Even snails
I hate the rubber texture
For me, it tastes like  a mix of chicken and fish
Nothing special as you say
I don't think so
So do I, but only rarely because my stomach is not fond of it haha
There is no rice inside blood sausages in France
>Things such as services, clothes and food, especially restaurants, are expensive
Yes, also relative to income
We lack a restaurant culture
Copenhagen is amazing for restaurants and street food from all corners of the world (or so I’ve had multiple even Southern Europeans tell me), yet average people go out to eat like once a month or less
Much less in the countryside
This was very striking to me as a tourist
Everything is sandwiches and incredibly expensive anyway
France is already expensive compared to the rest of Europe though
So I live in Germany and I have lost touch a bit with the prices in France, and I also lived in Paris which is especially expensive
But I’ll give it a try
- nothing in the supermarket costs less than 1€, not the cheapest thing, or maybe barely
You cannot buy more than one item with one euro
- the cheapest meal you will find (sandwich, crepes, kebab type thing), really barebones with no drink or dessert is already at least 8-10€ maybe 7 if you are very lucky but with the quality that goes with a lower price
- in an actual restaurant, the cheapest meal is usually 12-15€, except maybe if you only have a soup (8-10€ or so)
A nicer dish (say, with meat) will be around 16-18€ and that is still without drink or dessert or any extra
If you go to a fairly good restaurant, have an appetizer and a dish and a drink, it easily goes up to 30€.
- in cafés, tea is 5€, coffee is 2€ at least
- in bars, one beer is 8€ (cheaper in some places but you kind of have to know where to look), cocktails 12€
- in supermarkets, beer is way cheaper at around 2€ per bottle for the cheapest
Still more expensive than other countries
A frozen pizza would start at 4€, maybe 3 if really really basic
Then of course you have cheaper things, pack of noodles at 1€, or below if you take the ultra cheap brand
1€ buys you a pack of flour, a pack of sugar, a pack of noodle (more or less), a baguette
-cigarettes are also super taxed and expensive, I don’t smoke but i know it was 10€ a pack when I left the city
For drinks and restaurant meals, you can shave 1-2€ off everything and have the outside-of-Paris price
But it is still not that cheap in comparison to say, Germany
Funnily enough, I almost edited my main comment to say that wine is probably the only thing that is comparatively cheap in France
It's our consolation :)
Germany is fairly cheap in relation to salaries
I feel like Belgium and the Netherlands were also generally affordable
Italy is also cheaper than France, but I don‘t know how the salaries differ
Some of these are very Parisian lol
I know, the 8€ beer
I don‘t miss it
But the Parisian region is one ~~tenth~~ \*sixth of the French population, so it does represent a fair bit of the French experience
It was so stressful living in Paris though
The smallest outing with a friend, and you spent 5€ to drink mediocre tea in a cafe that you left after one hour and a half because the waiter was shooting dirty looks at you for occupying the table too long
I mean, we'd need to compare buying power rather than prices
Since most of Europe uses the euro, the comparison is more worthwile
You're right, it's one sixth
I always mix up 10 mil = one 6th with 6 mil = one tenth
It's used a lot, as much as a french word
It's not seen as an english word, just a word we use a lot
The direct equivalence in french is "d'accord" so as "ok" is way shorter it's very commonly used while texting and speaking ( "d'accord" is still commonly used as a stronger "ok" )
Well as "d'acc" is as short as ok I prefer to use the French word
Ça c'est de la référence
It is but saying ok is easier than repeating d'accord, d'accord, D'ACCORD
Also we don't use okay, only ok
And we only use it to agree
We don't say something is ok commonly, but it may happen
Oké???? That's how southern french people sound saying it but nobody write it like that
We just use ok
It's pronounced okê where I live
I've heard "rendi" as a short version for "rendben" is it also commonly used
Only for Québec
Here it means rather Thursday/Friday
Fin de semaine depends on the context but it nearly always means Thursday or Friday, especially in a work-related context, because we say week-end for Saturday and Sunday
As another comment said, "Fin de semaine" is understood as "the end of the week", which, in English as well, means "end of the work week" most of the time
Well pure french would be more similar to what they use in Québec, in France we are a lot more relaxed and use english word no problem, but some people sometime complain about it
The funny thing is that some world in english come from french, some were changed a little with time, and now we use the english word in french, when the word comes from the french to begin with
That it's preferable if he doesn't know anything
I would say we are doing alright
Could probably do better, but as it is we are definitely part of the lucky ones
We are cool with the germans now
You didn't ? Seems to me like you did
Really ? How about "Despite all the devastation, Europe managed to reconstruct and is now at peace, and has been for a half-century, and yes that inludes Germany
" ?
That is a happier way to look at it for sure
Every country has their idiots and in most of the world they do a decent score (including France)
I mean yes, but you still avoided having them for a much longer time than most European countries, and they haven't gotten as powerful as they have elsewhere
I'd say you've learned the lessons better than most
Sure, I should have said "Northern, Western and Central Europe".
Is boulangisme well known in Austria
It’s not even really well known in France as far as I know
That’s crazy I love France too
That’s what I suspected, Boulanger is kind of a footnote in French history, I don’t expect French people to know about him and even less so foreigners
There’s two big cities (not exactly big big but still) in my region, Nancy and Metz, whose been in conflict since 1420 to today
Both cities are beautiful and worth the visit, but what people don’t know is how much bickering there is between the two
May it be for historical reasons, football teams reasons, attracting people reasons, there’s always something, and even the inhabitants like to mock each other
The story between the conflict and of how long it’s been lasting it’s very interesting as well and it goes back almost to the moment the cities were built
For exemple when the region started plans for a TGV train station, Nancy said "We want it here
" And Metz said "No, we want it here", and it went on and on for a while until the regional council decided to put the train station in the middle of nowhere, away of the two cities
I love the history of my natal city Rouen
It was created by the viking Rollo, an English King was born there, the famous writer Guy de Maupassant was born there too and wrote some novels about it and many impressionist painters produced canvases of Rouen
There was a huge statue of Napoleon in front of the City Hall placed during the Second Empire but it was removed for restoration and we found a metal box under it with many books which are very deteriorated by humidity but people are working on recovering the books
There were like 4 train stations before train unionization but only one remain, the others have been destroyed but there are plans to construct a new one on site of one which was destroyed
This project is part of "Grand Paris" which aims to enlarge Le Havre sea port and connect it to Paris through the new train station in Rouen
I recently learned that at some point in history, there were _Swiss_ refugees going to France
It sounds super interesting (I’ve never heard of people leaving Swiss, always people going to Swiss to avoid persecution/one thing or another), I had never heard about it before, and I can’t find a thing on the topic
Malta is well known for the Christian crusaders
The name change was a mistake, Ragusa had some sort of brand recognition, Dubrovnik doesn't. Great suggestion though
Dubrovnik and Durrës used to be very important cities and they don't really get the press they deserve
It's okay you're all united in hating Paris
The only thing the whole France can agree on indeed
La Défense is pretty damn modern as it is the financial disctric of Paris, much like Wall Street in New York
Buildongs are very modern looking but there's also a lot of modern pieces of art
In France, it would be La Defense near Paris
It is basically a business district with skyscrapers
Nothing comes to mind and I hope it never happens
(Maybe puteaux
Our cities must keep their cultural cachet
Buildongs, because size matters
Hahaha eh merde
In France we have [Y] whose inhabitants are called the ypsiloniens which sounds way cooler than it has any right to
We have Y, a small village in Picardy, else there are also 2 hamlets named Ô in the South
With 2 letters, we have Ay, Bû, By, En, Eu, Fa, Gy, Oô, Oz, Py, Ré, Ri, Ry, Sy, Ur, Us and Uz
Someone must have had a lot of time and fun that day
Never learned another Romance language, but I basically understood what it was about for all of them
In terms of level of comprehension, I'd rank them as follows: Catalan > Italian > Romanian > Spanish > Portuguese
I might have stumbled on some pretty fortuitous Romanian articles though, I suspect I'd generally have an easier time with Spanish overall
Catalan was very easy, feels like I could read a pretty complex text and understand a lot of it
spanish, very big article, i knew the subject pretty well, so i guess i understood it easily
italien: small article, easy to understand
Portuguese: not much, apart for the words that are similar in french
Romanian: almost nothing :(
catalan: i guess it was an easy article, understood almost everything except a few words
&#x200B;
Romanina: it's about someone called Zoé. From the picture I guessed she was made a Saint
I understood she was the daughter of Constantin al VIII-lea and was consort impress
She died in 1050, the I'm not sure: in the house of  [Constantin al IX-lea] with him
&#x200B;
Italian one then: "Porto Lucena is a city from Brazil, in the state of  [Rio Grande do Sul] is part of  [mesoregione]  from the North-west of the Rio-grande and of the micri region of Santa Rosa"
Portugese:    Temecula is a city located in the American state of California, something about Riverside
It has been incorporated the 1th of december 1989
I openend a Romanian that was a few lines about a little town in Spain, so I tried again hoping to get something about Romania but I got a snake unique to Venezuela instead
Lol
Catalan led me to some peculiar fish of the sting ray family, ok
The Portuguese insists to be about UK Life Guards, lol again, so second draw in Portuguese is about Olympic swimming competition, butterfly breastroke in China, Nankin 2014, easy
I skip the 3 others because I know I can understand
I speak Spanish, French and Catalan, so it makes it much easier to understand the cousins
Italian: 98%, perhaps a word here and there that I miss, but would understand through context
Galego and Portuguese: 99%
Romanian: 60%, I brought though there if I were to learn how to pronounce the word, I'd understand significantly more
- Spanish: I speak Spanish a bit and could understand [most of the arcticle] without much difficulty
- Italian: Incredibly easy, I understood pretty much everything
feels like a mix between French and Spanish
As a bonus, [the article was very thematic]
- Portuguese: harder, but not *hard*. Reading it felt like bizarro Spanish, and I could understand the main points of the [again, very thematic article]
- Romanian: This one's a doozy
I could understand some sentences and the general meaning of [the arcticle] but not much else
- Catalan: Feels like bizarro French to read
I can understand most of [the arcticle] but it is harder than Spanish and Italian somehow
- Galician: Very, very very similar to Spanish with a Portuguese touch, so fairly easy to read and understad [this arcticle]
Overall, discounting Spanish that I speak, the easiest was definitely Italian and the hardest, by far was Romanian, followed by Portuguese
Got [this] and even if I don't speak italian, I could basically understand everything written
French : 100%; Spanish : 90%; Italian : 60%; Portuguese : 90%; Romanian : 30%; Catalan : 80%; Galician : 80%;
i tried again, and everything seems to be the same, except the catalan
I've understood nothing this time but the topic
Doesn't help that native speakers in both languages speak very fast
English is partly intelligible with Dutch
My favorite absurd translation is a multi-layered one, and it's for Ruben Östlund's film Turist
This is a Swedish film and that's the title in Swedish, and it so happens to be a "transparent" word in both English and French, meaning that it's understandable even if you don't speak the language
That didn't stop the marketing team from changing it though, oh no
In English, they went with "Force Majeure". The film does take place in France and this is a relatively well-known term in English (because it's used in law)
but it gets pretty funny when considering the title chosen for the French market
"Snow Therapy".
Swedish film, with a Swedish title understandable in both French and English, that gets a French title in English-speaking countries, and an English title in France
Gotta love it
Translating names in LotRO is perfectly appropriate considering in how much linguistics it's drenched
I'd even suggest that *not translating* would be something of a subversion or disrespect
The original work in English is itself stated by Tolkien as being a translation of an in-universe text, English acting as a medium for rendering the Common Tongue
Master Roshi from Dragon Ball is nicknamed "Tortue Géniale", a.k.a "Great / Awesome turtle". The turtle part makes sense, the "great" part I don't know where it comes from
The names of the main characters were not changed, except for *Neville Longbottom* that became *Neville Londubat* and *Tom Marvolo Riddle* that became *Tom Elvis Jedusor* (to keep the anagram *Je suis Voldemort*)
Also, *Hogwarts* became *Poudlard*.
Actually, the translator Jean-François Ménard did a pretty good job
The translator did a stellar job
The "elvis" part or the "jeu du sort" one ?
« Marvolo » sounds like the thing that comes out of your nose in French
« la morve ».
I think it really sucks for the history and the representation, I wouldn't say I'm devastated but I feel sad about it
I really hope it won't collapse
I imagine the Vatican is going to send us a paycheck
I don't care much -if at all- for the religious side of things
This is an architectural and historic loss, but it will be rebuilt and this will be part of its story, it was not entirely this original building already, so while this is bad, this is not the end of it
Many churches were already burnt almost to the ground and rebuilt, they're still historical buildings and it's part of their stories
TL:DR : Let's be positive
Edit: [Shared on r/France]
I'm on the verge of tears right now
It's horrible
It makes me really sad
I feel like I didn't take nearly enough time to appreciate it while it was up
I never thought it would be destroyed someday
It has always been here and I never considered it wouldn't be here anymore one day
I'm literally on the verge of crying
Luwembourgish is a mix of German, french, and luxembourgish, it’s pretty weird to hear because you’ll hear some completely unknown words and then boom you hear a few familiar one
It is, but it should be said that Walloon, unlike Flemish in Flanders, is not the language most people speak in Wallonia, right
It's mostly French
Yeah definitely
I guess your « personnality » depends how you learned the language:
-I learned French as my first language so im normal when I speak French
-I learned Portuguese with my family so Im way more down to earth when Im speaking Portuguese
-I learned English through Internet and by making friends around the world and I can feel the changes:like I speak louder faster and swear a lot
You really do change personnalities when you switch languages
Also I noticed how youre waay less shy and more willing to confess when you re not speaking in your native language
I'm way more confident in English
Also I'm still in France :(
> French - I complain more
Yep, you've got the french way figured out, good job
Vatican City
Sorry Esch-sur-Alzette
In my experience Bavarians feel more threatened by Hamburg than Berlin
Berlin is just on a whole other plane
Hahaha I meant that Bavarians don't even compare themselves to Berliner, because Berlin is almost like a foreign country
But I love the joke :D
Government collapses were quite common in France during the Third Republic (1870-1940) and the Fourth Republic (1946-54), both of which were parliamentary democracies
Governments were ephemeral because of party fragmentation and unstable coalitions – for instance there were 99 governments between 1879 and 1940
Our current, Fifth Republic is organised in such a way that Government collapses are extremely rare (only happened once in 1962)
We're technically a parliamentary regime – although in practice we're semi-presidential –, but there are two main factors which curb Government instability :
1/ Motions of no confidence have little chance of passing
Government is held accountable to the National Assembly (our lower house of Parliament) insofar that deputies may vote a motion of no confidence, but they usually don't do that, for two reasons :
* the number of votes required for the motion passing is high : it needs to be adopted by a majority of the members composing the Assembly, and not the majority of voters
* the Head of State (President of the Republic) can dissolve the National Assembly anytime he wants, which puts immense amounts of political pressure on Parliament
This is what happened in 1962 – the National Assembly voted a motion of no confidence against the Pompidou Government because they disagreed with De Gaulle's policy
So, in turn, De Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and reconstituted the Government, with Pompidou as Prime Minister just like it was before
Such a mechanism makes deputies unlikely to vote for a motion of no confidence, because the threat of dissolving the National Assembly would basically make them jobless
2/ the Head of State's and National Assembly's political party is usually the same
We call this the « fait majoritaire » (majority fact), and it happens because of three reasons :
* our Head of State, since 1962, is elected by universal suffrage with absolute majority (a second turn of elections is needed if no candidate receives 50 % on the first turn), so his election tends to reflect the majority political opinion in France, which in turn is reflect in ballots for legislative elections
* presidential and legislative elections are synced : since 2003, the Head of State is elected for five years instead of seven, which is the same length as a deputy's term of office
Our President's and deputies' elections cycles are therefore synced, with each happening one month apart
As the majority political opinion tends not to shift a lot during that time, and as voters tend to vote for the President's political party by default, the Head of State and President tend to be from the same party
* deputies are elected in a two-round ballot, which eliminates parties with too low scores and favors large groups and thus favors the creation of a strong majority in the National Assembly
Others Frenchs discribed our situation very well, but when I see how often government collapse around us, holy moly I'am happy that we threw away full parlementarism
I gave up understanding Italian politics a long time ago lol
Everytime I feel bad because I don't remember who is the PM of Italy but then I remember it changes all the time lmao
The only names I remember are Renzi, Conte, Salvini and Bersculoni
It's a very nice bonus for work is you do actually speak English (and didn't just say so on your resume) but the last stats I saw only 14% were able to speak a second language and most not to a fluent level
French people in Reddit are a small minority where speaking English in often the by-product of our interest (videogames, IT careers etc) but a lot of people outside that minority often see it as being pretentious to be able to speak English and something you shouldn't brag about
People here usually don't speak English very well, and often only know how to speak French at fluency level
People may know basic conversation/travel stuff (where's the airport, how are you) in usually Spanish or English
Speaking a foreign language at fluency level is seen as a nice asset
(There are of course French people who are bilinguals, I'm talking about the country as a whole
You're so right saying it's seen as pretentious and it infuriates me
I've immensely improved my English watching TV shows, reading and spending way too much time on reddit, and I must admit I tend to use "frenglish" a lot when I'm with friends
While most of them do the same, those who don't understand English (or don't want to) give me the look
Yes, disrespectful
At least with me, even  close friends would never do that
Even at my brother's house I don't do that
The only place I do it is at my parents' house
It's rude to search for things when you're a guest period
Yes, definitely
*But* I love it when my very, very closest friends (who will stay over regularly pre-Covid and crash on my sofa - or platonically in my bed) help themselves to things from my kitchen
Like giving them a key to my apartment so they can let themselves in before I arrive or take my dog out, I see it as such a fulfilling sign of how they’re like my family
I’m closer to my best friend than I suspect I’d ever be with an intimate partner tbh and I’m utterly comfortable in her company
Watching her make breakfast in my kitchen before she shoots off to work fills me with so much warmth
I love when her hair smells of my shampoo that she’s borrowed
I love when I can’t find my jacket and I have to text her and ask if she’s wearing it
I complain at the time and tell her she’s a pain in my arse but secretly I’m delighted
I’m so glad that my house is also her (other) home
I absolutely love British literature and the subtle, peculiar British humor that comes with it
Germany: all Germans I met were very cool and easy to talk with
They also tend to be frank which is something I value a lot
Belgium: awesome beer, my favorite in the world by far
Switzerland: gorgeous countryside, I also enjoy they direct democracy thing
I feel like we would have to strike less often with a similar system
Italy: food, culture and language
I feel like we are kindred spirits
As we say French people are Italian people in a bad mood
Spain: I don’t know much about them
I love chorizo so I will just say that
German politics are not as delusional under illusion of splendor as ours
I also enjoy German people being more straightforward as we are; Freikörperkultur is also something i admire
I love how Italians are so surrounded with antiques they don't care anymore and someone ends up graffing something actually funny/clever on it
(i'm speaking about the low low end of antiques you can find - like an old shitty column or smth)
I love how Belgian work hard party hard
And  their old goofy artists you always end up talking to  (after 3 pints) when you sit at a bar
I love UK's country side hobbit town, their pub culture, their music, their sport traditions, i love they hate because they're jealous, i love they always have to cheat or use boats to beat us
I love Dutch designer, their political progressivism (maybe i'm wrong on that, hard to say from abroad), their painters and that cheese, oh that cheese
I love how Spaniards seem to spend half their lives outside, and their crazy movie directors (they went full crazy after Franco i guess)
Aaaand i'd love Luxembourg to give the money back come on please we're broke so come on François rend l'argent
Finally i love you all accept us even though we're pretty fucked up as a Nation
Ha man I'm not even drunk but I love you all in ways that are hard to describe
Belgium : you guys are genuily nice, friendly, it's just hard not to feel at home there
I've never been big in capitals (and I despise ours, Paris) but yours I would move into in a heartbeat
Spain : well I mean to me it's family
And there's something about that too, I'm just so proud of my family, big, noisy, funny, so god damn loud did I already say that
But bloody amazing and just warm
Netherlands : you're a tough one to crack, had some tough years there, I struggled getting use to a few things there
Making friends there felt hard but boy if you put the effort, those friends are for life
England : country of my in laws and that always feel so diverse and accepting
At least to me you seem a lot more accepting than France
And
I like the way you work
Working in France with people not respecting meeting time and being late drives me through the wall
The others
I don't know you enough I'm sorry but still, I love you all except you Germany
(nah, just kidding, I'm starting to like you a lot too)
Belgium Beers
Santé les potos ! :)

Cheaper packs of smokes
Not gonna lie it's cool to see but it gets weary at times
That example with champagne is really a good one, happened to me multiple time in store ...
I mean why wouldn't we, we're fucking French
Lmao, in reality we regularly put "prout" (ie "fart") on trending on Twitter
EDIT : Just remembered that we broke the record for the largest-gathering of Smurfs while the Covid19 is still spreading
Guy on Reddit solve all Balkan's conflicts, 2020, coloutized
I kinda heard Gengis Khan's disapointed sigh from beyond the grave at that statement there
They're philosophical in their own, special way
>\* As if the French have sandwich fillings other than ham, cheese or ham and cheese
Tssssss
I know right
Très grande fierté
We could make a tradition to send our hated politicians in Spain ?
You guys took good care of Valls after all !
Goodbye Melenchon, no more Cult of Personnality for you
Marine le Pen
she’s pretty much the Trump of our country but she didn’t become president
Or we could send them BHL, Eric Zemmour, Michel Onfray or Michel Houellebecq
You're aware they're sending him back
I don't think you understand what the word democracy means, you probably mean "republic". The UK already *is* a democracy
You could wait her death (except if she is truly immortal), most people like *her* specifically, you will have way less trouble kicking the others out (just sayin')
I mean we'd be happy to pay for them if you keep them, we'd be graceful for it
^^^^Please
These four
Yep
Exactly
Add in Marion Maréchal Le Pen just for good measure
Alain Finkielkraut, Pascal Praud, Christophe Barbier
Wait, what ?! If the kids are being naughty they are sent to Spain ?
I mean he finalize his political suicide with you guys so that's that :)
Yep ! But idk, I would feel bad
Spain is nice, we don't want any of the Le Pen to ruin it
Damien Rieu, Dieudonné, Alain Soral, Daniel Conversano, Christine Boutin, Marguerite Stern, Cyril Hannouna
>you guys
I'm French too !
That'd be a good deal tbh
Imagine if you could send your worst politicians to another country ! We could make an EU+ exchange program !
And Apolline de Malherbe
I'm guessing this is a remnant of the 80 years war ?
Otherwise it's pretty damn strange
The flair didn't appear !
That's why the "+" was for, we can rename it if needed
Just nothing that would humiliate the kid
You are still getting a lot of freedom though
It's a bit different
If the name is going to hurt the child ("against the interest of the child"), the civil servant that register birth is allow to withhold registration and bring the case to a court/mediation's attention who will decide if, indeed, the name can hurt the child
The law doesn't specify what would exactly hurt a child but of course anything derogatory comes to mind
Also, names have to be in Roman letters with only French diacritics
We usely have several name at birth (each of them are equally our names) but once it's registered you practically can't change names, so better not go overboard
No laws but i remember a little scandal from one decade ago where there was a family named Renault exactly like the car brand, they got a daughter and wanted to name her Mégane or Zoé, I don't remember exactly, wich are models from the Renault brand and it was refused to them to avoid their child to be mocked for such name
A bit like this
And there are quite a number of gender neutral (to the ear) names in French, so the part about gendered names is a big no
Hell, our president is called Emmanuel
(Emmanuelle would be the girls’ name, pronounced in the exact same way
) We also have Claude & Claude, Pascal & Pascale, etc
A funny case we studied at uni : Aude Javel
For context, 'Eau de Javel' means bleach and is pronounced the same way as 'Aude Javel'. The parents didn't realize that and had already chosen the name, no ill intent whatsoever
The courts still ruled that the name was too hard to bear and ordered them to chose another one
And famously, no regional names using letters not usually found in French - still a big controversy in Brittany
For us too, tbh
Strangely, while the language is gendered, names aren't.
Most names have a specific gender expectation but some don't.
Anne used to be a masculine name in the long past
Some names go back and forth between being feminine and masculine like Camille
Some have been very common for both boys and girls at the same time like Dominique
Sans oublier Camille
Yeah, I think there was another case where the Renault family decided to call their daughter Megane like the car
really ? I though that kind of prohibition had been abolished
Consider yourselves lucky we no longer flog kids who speak regional languages in school
We got soft with you guys and that’s how we are repaid: with moaning and complaining
Isn't every name associated with a saint, or does that only work with the main ones
Or do you have a bunch of old roman/etruscan names that are lacking any corresponding saint
Anne used to be gender-neutral too
Yes, there were men named Anne
I have two married relatives called Pascal & Emmanuelle, or Pascale & Emmanuel, I never remember
Fun fact: there were probably jokes about his name in France too, because of the Jackie & Michel brand (all things sexy time brand)
[Here's a fresh summary]
ñ is the only one, and its status as non-French is debatable - it's used for some Spanish loanwords and the tilde was also used on vowels in old timey French
Ok that's hilarious
[And that concept has a name]
In France at least, Camille as a male name has become more popularized by world champion swimmer Camille Lacourt
But yeah, I was shocked to learn about Anne
I couldn't find any Belgian male Anne for you but it's also used in the Netherlands
French here
If I had to pick one among the hundreds if not thousands of museums we have
It would have the be Le Louvre
Musée d'Orsay is my personal favorite but there are so many incredible ones
Palais de Tokyo is my fav
Please do not listen to that obnoxious fredditor saying Musée d'Orsay (they never went, just want to sound posh and original)
Outside Paris you should visit Marseille's MUCEM, Lyon's musée des Confluences, or Centre Pompidou Metz (did i stutter ?)
As cliché as it sounds
I agree, it is a awe-inspiring experience
I LOVED visiting it
Couldn't agree more
Warsaw in particular has got some of the best offerings out there, which is quite a feat on a continent full of great museums
Les Invalides ? It wzs also very cool if that's whar you meant
Where does most of the art displayed at the Louvre come from then
Oh wait
Let me guess your answer
Italy
lol
I've read so many Italians complaining about the Mona Lisa being in the Louvre
Not our fault if Leonardo Da vinci sell it to François 1er
My father is near monolingual (speaks a little English, but not great), so mostly my parents used other tricks when I was a kid
However, since I have a sibling much, much younger than me, when my parents want to discuss something with me that they don't want him to hear, we switch to English, because me and my mother speak it
In front of my cousins, who are often preteens who start to grasp English, we use Spanish, with mixed results as no one in my close family is above decent at Spanish (except, of course, in front of the Spanish part of the family)
People may use English XD My mom used to do that when I was younger ("gifts" instead of "cadeaux")
If you happen to have a slightly higher level of English fluency than the average person (aka a better accent), odds are in your favor and you will probably not be understood (especially if you use fancy vocabulary)
This works wonderfully on children of course
I can't remember my parents did this to me, but my grandparents used complicated expressions, mostly from the countrysides to talk about subjects in front of us without worrying too much we could get it
This was mostly for things like OP said, desserts while we had a family dinner
My cousins however are English and just learning French, the younger ones are not yet bilingual so I guess it's a different and easier story for my grandmother, she can speak French in front of them
I'm not sure she is doing it regularly
I used to speak in English with my wife when we wanted to communicate without our young daughter to understand
I know people in my family switch to English for those things or spell the words letter by letter extremely fast
It happened through all my childhood
My parents would speak to each other in Alsatian dialect when they didn't want me to understand
When i was a little boy my parents talk sometime in english
Ofc i had no clue about what there were talking about so it seems efficient
There is no Dutch version of Pokémon
That's a real shame, and it's on Nintendo, again
Pokémon n'aurait pas une version en français non plus si un mec s'était pas amusé à tous les traduire
Ah il l'a fais gratuitement ? C'est même pas Nintendo France ou je sais pas quoi qu'a payer quelqu'un mais vraiment bénévolement ? Ben dis-donc
En fait je sais pas s'il a été payé mais il était employé chez Nintendo au Japon à l'époque et c'est lui qui a insisté pour pouvoir traduire les noms
Quel héro national
I feel so uncomfortable now because it seems like 50% of answers are “Please just speak English immediately” and 50% say “It’s rude to just launch into English and assume you’ll be understood” so like
what do I do
How to not be annoying
I’m socially awkward enough as it is but when I go *anywhere* I will frantically search for YouTube videos to teach me to say “Do you speak English please
” and “yes/no/sorry/thank you” in the local language and I won’t approach anyone without trying to ask first
If they ever say no to English (or French) I just have a panic attack and awkwardly go “ok, [sorry]
” and walk away dejectedly
Personally, I’m endlessly patient with language learners
I love it when people want to have a go
We’re not all lucky enough to have had comprehensive language education in school or been able to pay for private lessons so people *need* real situations to learn in
I never want anybody to feel like they’re foolish or burdensome (even if they are tbh)
I think French people really appreciate it if you try to speak in French with them
One thing that annoys me about tourists in Paris is when they just *assume* that I speak and understand English
I think the bare minimum is to first ask « Bonjour, parlez-vous anglais s'il vous plaît ? » (Hello, do you speak English please ?)
It helps (we appreciate that you take the time to learn, and try), but if it seems like the person you’re talking to wants to switch to English it’s ok to let them
It likely means that they have a hard time understanding you (I’m thinking about conversations with people you don’t know well: when asking for directions, at a restaurant/bakery, etc)
If you can't handle a conversation, then don't. I know we French are known for being bad at English, but this is a much better option than having to guess what you're trying to say (whereas everyone knows a few basic English words)
It's not annoying if you can make sentences (the accent doesn't really matter if you know the grammar)
But the thing is, most people overestimate their language skills
If you're trying to improve, maybe the batista at a crowded café or the random passerby aren't the best choices
(they don't have either the time or the patience)
To be honest, seeing the level French people have in English and witnessing the level tourists have in French, it's just a mess all around
Sure it helps, even just a few words, it shows they respect our country (plus no one speaks English here)
I feel you
Every time I travel to a new country I try to learn at least the very basics : hello/thank you / sorry / goodbye
And sometimes a random sentence, it’s always fun to break the ice
Regarding tourists in France, perhaps it’s because it’s my standard, I’m expecting them to at least try
We will catch pretty easily if you can or cannot handle the conversation
If I’m working and you want to practice now, if I’ve got the time I’ll speak with you in french, even help you find the right word
If I’m a bit in a hurry I’ll most probably node and smile but won’t further the conversation
I’m also used to saying hello in every shop I enter, to both the clerk and the security officer
Same on my way out, I’ll say goodbye and bid them a good day
So I would find rude someone who is not answering back if I was the one working (not working atm, but if you enter my shop and don’t answer my bonjour back, I will say it endlessly until you answer
I am not your dog, a minimum of humanity goes a long way)
Would seem pretty rude tbh
Sauf que personne parle anglais ici faut être honnête
Ne úgy beszélj, mintha minden magyar beszél angolul :D
Ami egyáltalán nem az igazság
Úgy tűnik, hogy mindenki nálatok azt gondolja, hogy ez a világ legnehezebb nyelve, de egyszerűbben tanulok magyarul, mint pl
japánul
The potatoe in the mouth
If there is one, the person tries to get the best accent
If there isn't, it's a stroke (or a native speaker)
That's not something to be proud of
Tanulj tanulj
Don't take it personnally if people reply in English
Most of the time, they're just as happy to speak English as you are to speak French
Also chances are they think they're helping you by switching to a language you might speak better
Yeah asking in English is fine too !
I’m sorry if that’s the case
Some Parisians can be real assholes
Mind you they’re not only rude to tourists
Because it's Paris, where people are most of the time in hurry and encounter plenty of tourists everywhere
I think if you talked in french to shop owners or servers they switched to english in order to go quickly on what you want exactly and move on to another customer
Pretty sure if you went into a group of youths in Paris or to shop owners in a smaller town, they would took the time to talk in french with you
But yea, Paris is pretty much tail or face, even for natives from regional areas parisians people seems rude and constantly annoyed
That’s sad :( I wish my fellow compatriots were not like that
Perhaps they thought they were helping .... if it can reassure you we are mean toward each other
French tend to be bad at foreign languages cause we just judge each other abilities all the fucking time ...! We do that in french too, correcting each other grammar
I think it’s just impolite to immediately start speaking to citizens of a country in another language
We are not a theme park with the red carpet rolled out for you
En vrai je pense que pas mal de monde parle au moins des rudiments d’anglais (voire parle très bien pour certains !) mais n’ose pas parce que l’accent et l’oral c’est _dur_, haha
On n’est pas assez entraînés à la prise de parole, mais on se débrouille :)
Englantia*, no
Can agree, it's very disrespectful if you don't greet people you meet here
Nincs kutyám?
Yeah that's what I said
I think the rude aspect was to say hello in the local language and not giving more information on how you would like the conversation to go on (native or English)
Meeting halfway means learning the follow string of vocabularies in French : hello, excuse me, do you think french, please, thank you
I don’t think it’s that hard, but then again I’m already french so who know
I guess french people are more sensitive to preserving their language, and do not like the global dominance of English
I think the two situations are quite different
The French speakers are a minority in Canada, and some feel they are being oppressed for that
So for them, it is a question a standing a ground, defending their culture and identity
In France, I feel like we havent integrated that French isn't a lingua franca anymore (if ever be), and as european citizen we are expected to have a certain level in English
I think it boils down to "you can speak one of your languages when you come to us, so I should be able to speak one of mine (even if it is my only one and my mother tongue) when I come to you".
So in Canada, it is a society issue, while in France many are just bad at foreign language, and because of our history some may feel a bit entitled so they wouldn't do the necessary efforts
I may be totally wrong, but it was my impression
Idk I've just learned that you have to use partitive when talking about languages but I may be wrong
En général les gens aiment pas discuter en anglais quand même
Nem értem semmit xd
It's a problem when you have as much English speakers as Norwegian speakers
Bah ça dépend
Moi j'aime bien parce que je suis à l'aise
Maintenant je n'apprécie pas trop quand un mec m'aborde et commence à me demander un truc sans saluer, en anglais ou français
I’m not sure french is declining on the world stage with African countries growing demographically
Maybe french spoken in France but french language has always been seen as universal
In France the debate is substituting English expressions when there are perfectly good french words to use
Younger, urban people don’t seem to see this as a problem
In a more general sense, French identity is deeply rooted in three institutions: the State, the memory of the French Revolution and the French language
My guess is that when french people, consuming Anglosaxon cinema, reading Anglosaxon books, following Anglosaxon politics, start seeing their own language as boring or lame, it’s a big part of French national identity that is being threatened for some people
Les trois-quarts des gens que je connais ne sont pas capables de tenir une conversation
Érdekes
Never told it was bad to speak it, I said it was bad when it exceeds the number of people speaking your official language
Oui je comprends ça. Après je vis en région parisienne donc je vois plein de touristes, et je bosse majoritairement en anglais avec des clients et fournisseurs de partout donc ça ne me dérange pas
Si ça se passe dans un coin pas très touristique j'imagine que c'est pas la même
I would hope the smell of a nice fresh butter croissant
Lavender, fresh baguette, and dear god I hope not the Parisian métro stations
If I wanted to show a good aspect of France i would say wine on top of it
If i wanted to be realistic i would say just take a smelly socks and some rotten milk in the fridge, mix those two and feel weak because France has a lot of eddible things that smells far worse than this mix
(for instance [Andouillette] or all those nice kind of cheese like the [Munster cheese] )
The European ideal is great
But in this specific case I am afraid it would be better to put France on its own separate board, or you won't be able to smell most other countries
Or IDK, maybe some channel #5 can compensate the smell of a nice maroilles
Interesting olfactive combination, I'm curious now
This is why I said "I would hope"!
That's pretty accurate, I personally smell of garlic, cheese, onions with a touch of peppermint to hide the alcohol and the cigarette
I'm sure my wife who's not French actually love it
I have lived 17 years in Paris and for me, Paris smell is the metro smell: piss and burnt rubber
The cheese you shall not touch barehanded, or else thee fingers will rot and withers
The town I grew up went from ~10
000 inhabitants in the 70's and constantly decreasing to ~6
500 today
The weirdest part is everything is clearly too big for the city, and subsequently badly maintained
The cool side is that I could watch two controlled demolition as a kid and that was a blast
My native town in South France has barely any people under 40 living there because the few teens leave for school all week long, the adults work in the big city nearby all day long and only come back in the evening
It's so depressing
Where is that town
Yes, it should
It would give users a break plus induce better quality products, give police a break to focus on severe matters (we've got plenty atm), empty court rooms & prisons, provide VAT and business taxes, provide a new market for tobacconists (a dying profession), most probably diminish the appeal towards it among teenagers (happened in other countries) and draw lots of people out of the illegal business
It would also diminish the impact of drug dealers on places where they are omnipotent lords now
It's been fought against for decades by politicians who don't understand what's going on and what's at stake, usually confusing pot with heroin
Yes, legalise it
France has the highest cannabis usage in Europe despite it being illegal
Ridiculous amounts of money are spent on drug war yet it's ineffective and ridiculous amounts of money are made from cannabis sale
In Russia it's difficult to get drugs as most people try to get it through the darkweb and it's controlled by police so people tend to resort to easy to make synthetic drugs such as Krokodile(Heroin on steroids) [Spice] which looks like cannabis but just destroys your body really, really fast and can kill you pretty easily
Surprisingly this drug was actually legal for some time and sold in Kiosks
Imagine how much profit the government would make if they legalised it and how much it would reduce the risks of people resorting to other, potentially dangerous drugs
I think it should carry very little criminal weight, but I’m not sure I’m entirely pro-legalization
Three main reasons:
It’s very difficult to accurately measure when someone has last been smoking which makes it impossible to control while driving
That’s a big issue imo
If it’s legal it will be smoked more in public places, apartments and so on and weed REEKS
Not sure I would want to legitimize what I personally consider to be a huge public nuisance
Weed presents strong health risks, especially for teenagers but for the population at large
If it is legal it will be easier to buy especially for minors, just like alcohol and cigarettes is
Weed is very dangerous for brain development
Aside from teenagers, weed can be a trigger for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in some individuals, and I feel like this risk is understated
Is it really worth it
Imo, medical marijuana could be a good first step, and in the meantime more studies should be done, and ways to detect it in blood, breath etc
developed
Cannabis shouldn't be legalized, majiruana should be legalized
There's so much bad mix of cannabis that it's horrible for the health, there's also the one that have a too strong thx
I'm absolutely against it because drugs are a vice that perverts people
It is a dangerous substance that destroys health and causes a lot of violence by its production
Yes, people should be able to grow, possess, and use cannabis on private property
Legalized but with strong regulation, like other legalized stupefiants like ethanol and tobacco
I prefer that market to be in the hands of lawful industries and under state scrutiny rather than under the radar ran by thugs
If people abuse drugs, there is usually a social problem to address, drug usage being a symptom
10€ in France the packets of cigarettes, at this price it's racket :/
Agreed it's so fucking retarded
Cannabis is extremely hard to get in Russia because everything goes through the darkweb, so people started resorting to synthetic drugs like Spice (some toxic shit that looks like weed but that kills you) or even worse, "homemade" drugs or fucking Krokodil
It's totally understandable considering the costs tobacco causes to healthcare
I grew up in France in a city next to Geneva and in Switzerland they don't say "soixante-dix" but "septante". The first time I heard that, I was sure that the Swiss are some kind of rebels and they decided to quit France and create their own country just because they didn't want to learn the 'corret' numbers
When I was young, I thought Cambodia was an African country because in French the name is Cambodge and it sounded very close to African countries' name to me
When I was younger, I thought that Slovenia and Slovakia were where the Baltic countries are, and that they were a whole country that got separated for unknown reasons
How silly I was
Portugal was never Spain Portugal has always been frindly with Galicia and the entire Spain
It is Madrid who enjoys to create fights for dominance and subject Portugal to speak spanish
Portugal does have the most fertile lands on the Iberian Peninsula
Portugal is 300 years older than Spain
Portugal was never Spain even when Portugal was ruled by a Spanish monarchy for 60 years
Holland and other European countries were also ruled by the Spanish Monarchy but it was never Spain /s
Among those i know, I’d say Dublin, Paris, Naples, Ljubljana, Riga
Edit : Or Lisbon, Carcassonne, Hamburg, Prague, Budapest
Lisbon, Carcassonne, Prague, Moscow (cities I personally want to visit)
We don't do it when it would be clear in context, which is the case here
I mean compared to those two everything is ok
Always go for lavazza qualità rossa
Call me weird but I make it in bulk and store my coffee in the fridge to put it in my cereal or latte macchiato freddo
My favorite that I can get my hands on easily is "Pfaff" a French one, can be found is some place specialized in coffee or some supermarket if the owner like coffee and get into the trouble of commanding some high quality
The best I ever drank is either one from Genoa or surprisingly enough one from a small "roastery" in Osaka, Japan (which expect this one place, is definitely not the place where I'd recommend drinking coffee)
Is it milled or in coffee beans ?
It sounds odd but special k milk coffee and a chopped up banana is my go-to breakfast
A healthy dose of Horse tranquilliser to start the day never hurt nobody
Dated and now married to a brit
Coming from a Spanish family and growing up in France, my main difficulty has been getting used to the eating habits
We take our time, food is very important to us and so is sharing where for him it's really about being done with it
The only meal that takes time has got to be the Sunday roast otherwise
Meh
With the years we've learned to adapt to both cultures and meals are now a bit of both of us but I think he still struggles when we end up going to my family and the meal stars at 2pm and ends at 10pm of we're lucky
I'm Colombian and my partner is French
While there are many differences between both cultures, its been an awesome ride to (re)discover the world through each other
Yes ! Although than can also cause misunderstanding sometimes, culture difference is a great thing, and we can talk about it for hours
Understanding the world from multiple perspectives is great for the relationship, that kinda creates a close relationship between the two
The farthest the country, the more the difference you'll notice
To anyone who never tried talking to anyone outside of EU, please do, you'll learn a lot
I'm a french girl and I'm almost her complete opposite XD  don't let her go
Ahah that is quite the stereotype indeed
Don't let her go, she seems like a keeper, enven for French standards
Can confirm
Bienvenue, mon frère
Let me guess, you dont speak a word of french
>In the Uk it’s really not all that special to have a threesome
*buys ticket to the nearest UK airport*
Germans be like let's eat dinner at 5
21h is a bit late for most French homes imo
19h30/20h would be a better fitting meal time
Anyway, 21h is still better than fucking 18h! Who's hungry at that time
Is this the US or Europe
Edit: guess what I changed
Can't tell if crazy early or crazy late xD
That's the usual time for a lot of people here even a little bit too late, more like 8-9pm
But I think 6pm is way too early for a lot of French people
At which time do you eat in Germany ?
Same, apart from "loves to use loads of onions, garlic, cheese and butter" lmao
I'm currently learning Italian
Is there something I should be careful about (if that makes sense) when learning ?
Yeah, between 7 and 8 is usually dinner time for me, not really 9
Vowel length, doubled consonants, and accentuation (stress)
> Waiting for that until 1-2 hours before going to bed wouldn't make sense to me
Well, this last sentence depends on what time do you go to sleep
I personally won't go to sleep before midnight/1a.m. So I've got plenty of time before I got to sleep
Amazing
Wdym lol
Thank you for your answer !!
What are the most comic "unfortunate language mistakes" that non native speakers make in your language
Some in French are famous ( and hilarious ):
"Merci beaucoup"="thanks a lot" , sounds like "merci bocu" with English accent, and means "thanks nice ass" ( beau cul )
Don't translate "I am hot" literally from English, "Je suis chaud" can mean "I am horny"…
Another mistake that English speakers, especially Americans, make a lot:
"I'm excited" doesn't translate as "Je suis excité", which means "I'm aroused". We would rather say "I can't wait for", and we don't even use that one much
There was an interesting [BBC Travel post] some years ago about the difficulties of an American to understand this seemingly lack of excitement of the French people
She makes some interesting observation about the French language and its relation to our way of life
In French, don't translate "I will introduce myself" (Je vais m'introduire) literally from English, It can be very sexual
This had me laughing way too much
I kinda hop someone asks me for food “without préservatifs” one day
(Psst, just a side note: the French word is “conservateur” -same as conservative people in Parliament, yes)
>conservatif
Conservateur
>les nourritures americains sont fait
La nourriture américaine est faite :)
Thanks for the link, it’s a real interesting point of view
As a French I had never given it much thoughts, so
TIL
At some point I thought that the author was going to speak of that French speaking about differences between French and American people: we sometimes say that Americans are like peaches -open and easy going, they’ll easily speak and laugh with you, but the core of their being is very private and only for their close friends to enjoy; while French people would be walnuts -hard to crack (break the ice with), but once you’ve made it inside you’ve got access to their whole being
This is another take on our differences, but one that I find it interesting as well
Any American here to confirm/reject this point of view
Ahah
Remind me an other one:
My mother once meet an american girl named joy at her church
She translate her name to my mother "fille de joie" (girl of joy) but this is a polite way to say prostitute ...
Apparently they use "Ça m’enthousiasme", but we would need a French-speaking Canadian to confirm
"foot" is never used to refer to the ball though
Kinda yeah
Yes, "baiser" is "to kiss" in an old fashioned way, but now it means to fuck
The way to greet is "la bise" and not la baise, so be careful ahah
Sounds like you had great time
Yes a lot of French don't eat foie gras because of the animals suffering
I guess so
I mean, if it wasn't with the USA and internet, I wouldn't know what millenials are and that we (apparently) hate baby boomers for ruining the economy
I don't think I've heard the term "millenials" in french
Not even sure how you'd say it, Les millénaires ?
It's not as visible as in the US, but generations exist here too
We have the generation which remembers WW2 and might have had a political role in it, or at least grew up during WW2 ; the boomers ; the last generation that grew up without Internet - was (almost) old enough to vote on 9/11 - remembers at least vaguely the Gulf War and the USSR ; the generation that grew up with Internet (born in the late 80s or later)
We're just far less obsessed with labeling our generations, but politically, they matter a lot as every generations votes differently
They do matter to politicians, but are much less visible because we don't label, categorize and divide everything like the US do these days
We don't like to label everything, because it causes deep societal divisions and some kind of dangerous "us vs them" ideology
We've had enough "us vs them" with WW2 and the Cold War, we're tired of it and we don't want that again
Also our generations don't strictly match the American generations due to different local politics and technology
TL;DR : generations don't really matter here outside of politics
Never in heard about generations like that in Europe, but I've heard someone from Australia use those (in a youtube video I think) so maybe it's not entirely limited to the US
It's unfortunately seeping with the help of social networks, especially in woke "hip" circles
Mostly related to housing and environmental issues
I think that in this case It says more about the person complaining because It's deeply ignorant of the issues they had
The older people harbour much less hostility toward younger generations than in America (or at least much less than what redditors seem to describe) and were much more likely to live in what most would consider severe poverty nowadays (no running water, poor insulation, literal slums around big cities etc
) at the time of their youth
The older people tend to have vastly different views, having voting patterns that differ heavily from their younger counterparts (notably, they vote a lot more for the establishment right wing party "Les Républicains")
But they're more like what you call the "silent generation" and very old "boomers" that weren't nearly as prosperous as young americans since wartime privations were very real and France was indeed quite poor till the end of the 50s for this reason
We really only have the 68-ards, it's oyr boomers, but even that isn't that common
There is les soixante-huitards
It is a thing
I don't think we have any equivalent in French, though I've heard many kids talk about "les 2001", "les 2002". Saying stuff like, 2001 are still okay, but 2002 are the worst
pretty stupid IMO
[Génération Y.]
Right off the bat, I'd say whatever is below La Défense (major business district)
It is said that some weird stuff happen in the basement, like satanic rituals etc
I think it's a popular urban legend amongst Parisians but I'm not that well informed about haunted places (since I'm not foolish enough to look for them lol) so I hope you get more conclusive answers for France
Les Catacombes de Paris are also quite creepy
Ooh, you're totally right
It was such an obvious answer but I totally forgot they existed lol ty
Is it that hard for you not to swear while you're in another country
Depends on the context
The only ones I can think if in french are "[à] (at, to, in, until depending on the context) and "a" (has for the singular third person)
There's also [y] (here, there, about it)
There are also transitions letters ("Il y a-**t**-il ... ?") and conctracted letters in front of vowels ("de" becomes "d'" : "Je suis content **d'**avoir ...")
But most of the one letter words depend on context
They don't mean anything by themselves
There are quite a few in french:
-a which is the verb "avoir" at the third person, ex : il a (he has)
-à a preposition which more or less means at
-y which doesn't really mean anything but is used ex : il y a (there is)
Then there are lot of contraction I don't know if it counts as words, like:
c' (contraction of ce)
l' (contraction of le)
m' (contraction of me)
n' (contraction of ne)
SPANISH
A - to
E - and, when the next word begins with i
O - or
U - or, when the next word begins with o
Y - and
FRENCH
à - to/at
y - location pronoun
A is a form of the verbal Have, only in the case of "He/She Have", "Il/Elle a"
And, if it means to, in or of in some contexts, then we have à
a (have with he/she/it), à (at, in), l' ("the" before a word which starts by a vowel), t' (ex : "je t'aime" which eans i love you), c' ("c'est" means it is), j' ("I" before a verb which starts by a vowel)
and our longest word (bc i saw comments about that) is "anticonstitutionnellement" which is an adverb which means "against the constitution"
True
Even though the main occurence of it I can think of is in Astérix, when talking to some authority ([for example]
Oh that's great
I don't really pay attention to grammar, I was pretty bad in French class
It's nice having words to describe it haha
Same here in France, you don’t tell people how much you make, and you don’t ask either
I think it depends more on the people you're talking to rather than the country you're living in
My experience with it had been a bit odd
Whenever I asked my parents they were almost frightful like “why do you need to know
” “Who’s asking
” etc
And they never gave me a real number just general approximations
In France it's a little taboo among the older generation, i share it without bragging about it
I think if you earn minimum wage, there is no taboo
If you are a cashier at a supermarket, everyone has a vague idea you get minimum wage, give or take
Now if you brag about earning 100k/year, in France you're considered a dick
I never encountered that, I know what people in my family make and all my friends too, it's not taboo at all
Yeah, it's somewhat of a taboo, don't exactly understand why though
Je dirais que ça dépend des gens
I've noticed it can go both ways here in Germany, some people just talk about it openly and some others seem unconfortable about the topic
I must say my Bavarian husband is brutally straight and has zero problems talking or asking about money matters, so perhaps people engage in fight or flight mode lol
True, but in France even a cashier can make a bit more money with the “primes” system, which is like a bonus; you get those if you live a bit far from the workplace, if you have kids, if you’ve been working there for more than 3 years
On top of that, if you work more than your 35h/week, you’re getting paid more, you get what’s called the “heures sup’”, which can range between 5% to 50%+ of your hourly wage
For these reason, it’s a bit more complicated to just guess how much money someone is actually making
Sure, but would you ask someone you just met how much they make ? Often times, you need to be friend with the person
Because if you're rich people will demonstrate against you
>On top of that, if you work more than your 35h/week, you’re getting paid more, you get what’s called the “heures sup’”, which can range between 5% to 50%+ of your hourly wage
>For these reason, it’s a bit more complicated to just guess how much money someone is actually making
Alright, point taken
But there is no way a cashier is making 100k/year, regardless how many 'heure sup'
Of course not but that's just common decency
I never saw it like that, but now that you say it, it makes sense
It’s also cultural
I currently live in Canada and everytime i meet a new person, we always come to talk about our jobs and how much we make within the first 15 minutes of encounter
You rarely see that in notre patrie
I see, I didn't except this to be a thing somewhere, good to know
Here in France, most of the "black" olives we found are marinated, not ripe
I only ever see black olives on pizza, I think (I don't like them so I'm not exactly an expert), but green olives are a common appetizer
In Provence they mostly make green olives but I only like Greek style black olives
Also, most of the black olives are used for pizza and the green olives are normally for appetizers or things like these
That's why there's a lot of green olives and less black ones
Not a rock, a giant ice cube
France isn't really a semi presidential country anymore, at least since the 2000 referendum
The presidential term in office was lowered to five years instead of seven, and parliament elections now happen just a month after the president is elected
So PR and PM have been from the same party for 20 years now, giving the President almost full control over the institutions
Wasn't the case before with the "cohabitations" other redditors explained
FWIW, "presidential regime" is a misleading term
It doesn't mean "a regime where the president has all the power", because if you look at the US regime (which is the posterchild for presidential regimes), the president is arguably much less powerful than in a "semi-presidential" regime like France, because Congress has a lot of power to block him
Even the British PM really is more powerful (in his own country I mean) than the US president sometimes, as long as he can hold his majority
The difference between "presidential" and "parlimentary" is a question of how the separation of powers between legislative and executive is organized
In a presidential regime, it is strictly enforced (at least in theory): Congress can't overthrow the President (impeachment is a judiciary process and requires crime, as opposed to mere political disagreement), and the President can't dissolve Congress, the most he can do is veto bills
By contrast, the separation of powers in a parlimentary regime is soft: in the UK, the House of Commons very much makes or breaks governments, and the Prime Minister can call for legislative elections at any time
So the legislative can overthrow the chief of the executive (the PM), and vice versa
Meanwhile, you have a head of State (the Queen in the UK and in other constitutional monarchies, presidents in many other countries like Germany), with very little power outside of major constitutional crises
If we look at France, it is technically a parlimentary regime
But four years into it, De Gaulle used a referendum (a dubious process constitutionally from the start) to make the presidential election a direct universal suffrage election
This, along with De Gaulle's personal charisma and place within the political climate of the time, made the President the actual chief of the executive, which completely imbalanced the system, because he now has direct democratic legitimacy, which tends to trump indirect legitimacy (through the legislative branch)
Now, the executive can still impact the legislative (the President can dissolve the National Assembly), but the legislative can only act on the PM (by overthrowing him), who's not the real chief of executive power
The legislative has exactly 0 power over the President, even less than Congress in the US
As another poster explained, this state of things was further cemented in 2000 when the legislative elections were scheduled to always take place right after the presidential elections, which ensures that a President will always have a majority in the legislative branch (because people don't change their minds that much in a month)
So in our case, the PM is basically a glorified manager
This has worsened in the past two decades, with the newly-minted PM being a virtually unknown technocrat as opposed to a well-known politician with a certain stature, as was the case before
There is no balance, if the PM is of the same party as the president, then the president have full power, if he's not, then the PM can block pretty much everything the president does
There is no balance
The president have full powers
The ministers are just aides to the president
Good question and good timing
In France, the recent nomination of Jean Castex as the prime minister highlights a fundamental problem with our republic : the president is extremely powerful
Not even talking about the executive power controlling both the judiciary and the legislative, leaving us with a parody of what we're taught as "democracy".
In parliamentary regimes, the PM holds the power and the parliament counterbalances it
In presidential regimes, such as the US, there is no PM, but there are other means for the legislative power to counterbalance
In France, the PM only acts as a fuse in case the parliament gets pissed
Which happens pretty much never, since the parliament gets elected one month after the president, which always guarantees him a comfortable majority and removes the need to negociate to create a presidential majority
For french speakers, this twitter thread is a very good explanation as to why France is fucked :
France has a disproportional amount of power, if not all of it, vested in the president
Up to 2002 there did happen to be presidents and prime ministers of opposing parties, in which case the prime minister ended up with most power to govern
However, since 2002 legislative elections happen 1 month after presidential elections, which means that these elections take place during the president-elect's peak of popularity, which tends to produce high results for his party
This means the PM will always be aligned with the president, and generally tends to be in service of the president
Then there is our parliament, the national assembly, I mentioned that its elections happen 1 month after the presidential elections, so normally it would be packed with representatives from the president's party
However, it has happened that that majority was a lot more slim, and it became possible at times that a law might not pass (eg the "loi travail") in which case the president and PM can use article 49-3 of the French constitution whose effect is that a law is passed into law without a vote from any of the representatuve bodies
There is also the senate, which is elected by some few tens of thousands of people who held elected offices of any kind
The senate tends to be more conservative, not just in the social way (for example most of its representatives still belong to LR and the PS, two parties that are now a minority in the national assembly) however it's also subordinate to the national assembly
The senate does have the power to launch investigations into the president and his governement, which does help a bit
The constitutional court which is like our Supreme court is elected 1/3 by the president and 1/3 by parliament, so you would think it'd be very pro-president, but surprisingly it has mostly done its job of censoring laws that go against the principles of the French constitution
Finally there's other elections like municipal elections and European elections which do have some influence on the governement and serve as a thermometer of the French electorate, however do not change the president's politics much
This is also why French people tend to protest, strike and riot a lot
Considering how unrepresentative the institutions are, often French people exert political influence through protests, strikes and riots
Tl;dr In France separation of powers is there in theory but a farce in reality, the president has all powers
From a french standpoint it's quite clear :
* President is giving the directions and priorities
* Government is implementing it through laws/rules
Now that's the official story ... reality is that it depends of the president, the prime minister, the topic, the media pressure, the current polls
The president is overpowered now compared to the PM but usually I'd say 75-25
France being "semi presidential" is a bit of a joke, tbh
> For french speakers, this twitter thread is a very good explanation as to why France is fucked :
I don't like that thread
It makes 3 claims:
- The PM is just a subordinate to the president (that's perfectly true)
- This is getting worse (that's not true: Pompidou was a nobody as well when he was nominated PM)
- That's a bad thing (that's highly debatable, and there's not much argumentation towards that in the thread)
Yes, they're elected directly (the MPs through a two round majority system)
It's totally possible for another party to win parliament elections after the President, but  it never happens in practice
The turnout for presidential elections is  very high by French standards (75 to 80%) and this legitimacy is key
So typically the President's party wins the parliament elections as the turnout falls to 50%, because every leader gets some kind of momentum
Chances are near to 0, legislative elections are barely 2 months after the president gets elected, when he'll be at the height of his popularity, he cannot lose the legislatives, only way I could see it happening is if the far right wins the presidential election, and I'm not even 100% sure they would lose the legislatives anyway
It being a bad thing is hardly debatable
The only people debating it are those who support the current president, because he essentially has all powers, and these supporters change with every new president
The thread's author has an extensive knowledge of constitutional law, and nothing there is subjective
Also, for Pompidou : sure, but that's really not the point there, and he had been de Gaulle's right-hand man for years, and a member of the Constitutional Council, before being appointed PM
In this case the Sejm pretends to listen to the president for a minimal amount of time (just enough to appease the public opinion), and then they do whatever they, or rather whatever one sad,old, angry bachelor from Żoliborz, please anyways
> and he had been de Gaulle's right-hand man for years
Which makes it way worse: he was deffinitly appointed as a subordinate to the president
> The only people debating it are those who support the current president, because he essentially has all powers
I think most people want a president who's able to act, rather than balances and restraint
That may be undemocratic, but most people are more anti-tyranny than pro-democracy
In Paris, not anymore, I guess
In the 90s any kid aged 8/9 and up would go and come back from school independently, and stay at home alone for an hour or two, but these days I see almost no elementary school kid without an adult and even middle schoolers get dropped off
That's said, parents take their kid by bus, metro or even scooter those days, cars are still very inconvenient
16th century+ French: some vocabulary issues but mostly no problem
older French: nope
but medieval latin, yes, so i have that going for me
There is a few words that I can understand but the rest is completely unreadable
Very accurate summary
I don’t read latin, though (medieval or not), so I have to stick to translations -of Latin & of old French
> It's not easy but you can definitely understand the general gist of the story
Or not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I really only got small fragments of a "strory". Like I understand there's a dog and an ewe
But that's basically it
It talks of death at a point but I'm incapable to say if the ewe did die or not
That's really it
Don't understand anything else
I learned classical latin in school as well as medieval latin in university
We only learnt one pronunciation, meant to be a "new" one, with "c" pronounced as "k"
"Actually" sounds like "actuellement" but means "en fait" (≈ "in fact), and I heard a lot of people pronounce the word "rap" "rape"
I would say that most French people get confused with the fact that police is plural in English (singular in French), whereas information is always singular in English, and can be and often is plural in French
Probably "I am agree".
In French,  you grammatically don't "agree" with someone but "are in agreement" with someone ("être d'accord avec quelqu'un)
Actually vs actuellement (an adverb) meaning "right now, nowadays"
Here too we "make" photos
According to this thread, every european makes the same mistakes in English . We do this with shooting, parking, camping ...
Same in France
Nope
[Always singular]
Nouns with no singular
>'The police are coming
The police are coming
' (They)
>Some nouns in English are collective
They represent a group or number of objects together
In many cases, these nouns are considered plural: they are collections of single pieces kept together
Because of this, they take a plural verb and have no singular noun form
Same in French, something _has_ sense for us
"Ça a du sens" is our "it makes sense".
But the English phrasing is starting to stick: lots of French people now say "ça fait sens", which is the literal translation of the English "it makes sense".
We can also say "prendre une photo" (lit
take a photo) but it's slightly less common
We use the same word for make and do so it's work as well
"Prendre une photo" is not only correct but widely used
It even sounds more natural to me than "Faire une photo" but I guess it's a matter of preference, or maybe region
Really
I would have said the opposite
"Faire une photo" sounds a bit weird to me
Regional differences maybe
(I'm from Paris)
Same in French (actuellement)
Well, we have fancy grammar but a poor sense of it
I hate it when people say « ça fait sens », but they do
"Faire une photo" is definitely more common here
"Here" being
En Lorraine
I was drunk in a nightclub in London
A dude didn't know how to dance the maccarena, so aften laughing at him several minutes (I was drunk),  I teached him the choreography
Later, we went together in the smokehouse to take a cigarette, and began the presentations
We talked in English like
20 minutes
And at one moment, he said  "but, you are French too !"
Yep, not very interesting story
Not especially funny, but this winter, in Reykjavík... I was chasing the Northern Lights and went at the edge of town to that lighthouse (Reykjavík residents might now where I'm talking about)
Quite a lot of people there but all in groups, and I came across the only other solo guy
We started talking in english, almost yelling through the wind
aaand it took me just a few seconds to notice his accent (note: I dont have an accent when speaking english) so, well
*"Ok, t'es français, vas-y, laisse tomber l'anglais alors, mec !"*
Usually, you can spot the Frenchs with the accent, it's quite easy
I'm French but I have been living in Amsterdam for a while
A few months ago, a friend of mine launched her online sex shop and she invited all her friends to party in Bordeaux, in France
Before going back there, I decided to get her dick and vagina-shaped candies from one of the touristy shops in the center of Amsterdam
So I find a shop on Hoogstraat, typical touristy shop with nutella waffels in the window and stuff
I go straight to the dick and vagina candies and fill a bag with them
When I go to the counter to pay, the clerk looks at my bag and smirks
Then, he says "These are quite popular among tourists". I recognize he has an accent but I'm not quite sure, so I answer in English with my thick French accent that I actually live here
He recognizes my accent and switches to French instantly
Turns out he came from Bordeaux, the very city I was travelling to
We chatted a bit, he gave me a few bar recommendations
Very nice dude
But alors you are French
Just alsace problems
Oh yes
I've been to supermarkets in small towns near the border where the cashiers greet you in German until you give them a sign that you'd actually rather speak French, because there are so many German customers crossing the border to buy stuff (very specific stuff, like bottled water)
Yes, but there are a lot of bilingual people
My boyfriend, who is a hotel manager, had a really difficult time finding a job in his area in Alsace because he does not speak German
Granted, hotels have a lot of German-speaking customers, but still, it's a little surprising especially considering he speaks English and Spanish fluently too
We did not expect not speaking German to be an actual issue, but it can be, in Alsace
Ours are huge
I wish they would make them the size of a debit card which would be much easier to fit them anywhere when travelling
Oh, and [they also look terribly fake]  (basically a plastified paper)
[Carte d'identité]
It just shows classic sex, DOB and height
In france the miscelaneous information would be : Size, eyes color, birth place
Just some indication to help police to figure out if it is really you
As France is very serious about laicity, we would never gather information about religion
We do
Besides name and date and place of birth, it shows gender, size, address at which you reside
And of course, there's your picture on it
Yes we have ID cards but they aren't mandatory
Though most people have one because it's quite useful
They look like [that]
I was actually quite baffled when I learned last week that not every country has one
Starting 2021, IDs will have credit card format IIRC
also they're peak 90s design
My bad
Oh my last sentence wasn't in a negative way
It was just something I grew up with so I never thought it was something some countries don't have
But it made me think about what does it implies to have one, especially about police ID checks
And let me tell you they suck a lot here in France
No need to look it up to say it'd be Paris/Paris/Paris/Paris/Paris
&#x200B;
For the second biggest, it was probably Marseille in 1600 and 1700, and Lyon ever since, though depending on how you count, it could be Marseille again
In France there is this sentence : "Paris and the rest".
I think this will answer your question
Naoned(Nantes) all the way for Brittany and Paris for france
I started in school when I was 10 but was godawful until around 16 when I started watching anime with english subs and gradually got better, in like 6 months I went from worst of my class to top 3
I learned the grammar in School, use to read a lot of translation of english music as a teen
Then i started to watch Rupaul's Drag race but i couldnt found subtitles so i forced myself to watch as it is and now i can understand easily english
Speaking it is tougher though, my accent is terrible
I started learning English around 11, and while school was useful to gain some knowledges, I really improved thanks to harry potter
I had previously read dozens of time each of the book in French, when I decided I wanted I wanted to try to read them in English
After that I found out about Audiobook and fell in love with
Jim Dale version of HP (he is a fantastic storyteller), and because I knew them more or less by heart, I think my brain was able to kind of guess the vocabulary I was missing
The only problem with that methodology is that I understand way better than I can speak, but otherwise I think it as a very good passive way of learning
It was during the summer before my last year of middle school
I was browsing through Wikipedia, and realized the English version of the article I was reading had more information
I thought "Uh
Would be neat to learn English
" Then I forced myself to watch English YouTube videos with French subtitles, then afterwards English, and then without them entirely
I also read Wikipedia articles in English and would use translation websites when I didn't know words
Started at 11 I wasn't good
Then my penny's could afford to send my in a host family that didn't speak anything else than English for 6 weeks 3 years in a row and I became much better
Picked up the basics in school at around 10 then really got into it at around 13 with youtube
I learned English when I was 5 because I used to live in NYC
I don't have the famous french accent when I talk so it's pretty fun to fool around with people
> english subs because they were faster released than french
Hahaha literally exact same reason, Toradora was SO slow to be released in French subs so I just switched to English, I already knew the plot and could recognize some words in Japanese so I just went with it and somehow understood most of it
Gaming was not an option, I spent all my teenage years playing Dofus and nothing else, so I didn't need english
"Sell Code Audio, no noob, no scam"
> you get used to same day release
it’s over
Yup, no coming back in French, nowadays it even feels
wrong to watch anime with french subs, like it's not how it's supposed to be
no arnak
I wasn't really a user of any website, I just direct downloaded what I found, then I went on 4chan, found nyaa, and then animebytes opened and I went on it in like 2011 and haven't moved since
I don't even watch anime anymore, I download something once a month just so my account don't go inactive, you know, just in case
Most people looked weird at me when I said I  was going to make mine in Lithuania
I was studying in Boulogne-sur-mer near Dunkirk and man it’s one of the most desperate place in France
On the other hand I was also studying in Reunion island and there were also a lot of Erasmus on it
It must be one of the most unique place Erasmus has to offer
I hope you didn't die because it's illegal there
Did you visit a lot ? How does it feel to be on an island so far North with so little people on ?
You should never go in the North of France it sucks as hell
Bretagne is freaking cool the only bad point is the weather
Btw where did you go
Yeah, learning a language quickly is one of the perks of studying abroad
I have nothing but positive thing to say as well honestly
It's pretty poor and even though people are really kind they're pretty weird and it's the kind of destination even the French avoid sometimes, everything is made of concrete, the weather is often bad so there are not many interesting things to see there
They could go to Brittany then
I mean, blue-eyed blond people *tend* to be more Northern and people with tanned skin, dark eyes and hair *tend* to be more Southern, but it's really not an absolute
Especially because here in France we're a bit in the middle of this so we really have people about equally distributed on that spectrum
I would definitely not be able to recognise a fellow French person abroad based on appearance alone
My very general rule of thumb: if the very tip of their nose is pointy from the side, there's a very good chance that they're from the east of a Poland/Croatia line
I'm talking about the tip here, not the bridge of the nose - I know aquiline noses can also be found in Central/Eastern Europe
It's having a rounded chickpea at the tip rather than a pointy profile that's rare there
First noticed that during a football match, have since then shared my theory with a bunch of Balts during a party celebrating their country's independence
At first they were all thinking that it was bullshit, but then they looked around and had to admit it held water
Years ago, if an adult was wearing something purple, he had to be German
Also if kids where looking like an arlequin (bright muticloloured clothes), German
But I guess globalization have pretty much erased most of the differences now, at least in clothing
Brands are now mostly global
I am living in a country where european tourists are mostly backpackers
I can spot my fellow French people very easily
I don't know, they have this nonchalent attitude, they do not wear very tidy clothes, and a quechua brand backpack, or some clothes or accesories from Decathlon
I cannot count how many times I spotted someone from relatively affar, thinking he was French, and then hearing French speaking when I am getting closer
There is something in the non verbal language that screams French to me
I guess we are better at spotting ours
That's very hard
I can spot a british, a western/northern european, and a southern european
There's not a lot of things that changes between german, dutch or french
Brits are red, or whiter than usual
Southern italians, southern spanish and portuguese have tanned skin
Sometimes you can also spot eastern europeans, because they have that slav facial features, but it's harder
In France, no (or not very often)
In less touristic countries (like Poland) but in touristic place (like Krakow), or in non European countries, I was able to recognize Spaniards, Frenchmen, Americans and Germans
Actually, after living for a year in Japan I have become better at distinguishing between Asian nationalities than European
The only ones I get fairly consistently in Europe are French and German people
It depends
When travelling, it's quite easy to spot the French, as they are all dressed in Quechua gear
Other nationality can be rather obvious too, mostly depending on how they dress or act
On appearance alone, it is hit and miss and quite hard, but I guess the same is true in most of Asia
I guess there are some "types" that match ones mental image of what an Italian, German or Norwegian look like, but it does not mean it is 100% accurate
You didn't guess any accent ?
The French are 100% decathlon/quechua gear
Don't forget the huge backpack and the sandals with socks underneath
I don't agree with you, in campings or sea side you can recognize Dutch, Belgian or Germans quite easily
Big expensive german car with a trailer, red skin burned by the sun, drinking a lot of beer all the day long
Quite cliché I know but I see that every summer =) They are quite nice people to play pétanque with
Where did you hear/see that stereotype
Yes but instead of a huge backpack it's a caravan and beers they brought from home
From my geoguessr experience I think it is related to Estonian (those double same vowels), but I might be wrong
I'd never heard about that one, is it actually something that's widespread
I feel like I'm learning secrets I'm not supposed to have heard about
Buy as many liter of disinfectant
It will cost more than oil and gold soon
Wait, the country of origin isn't indicated on produce in Belgium
In France it's mandatory
> Edit: Only one of those things is the most fundamental biological urge of humanity
Well shit I guess some of us aren't human then
There are probably hundreds in French but here are a few of my favourite:
"faut pas pousser mémé dans les orties" don't push granny in the nettles = don't over exaggerate, don't take it to far
"il pleut comme vache qui pisse" it rains like a pissing cow = it rains a lot
"Avoir le cul bordé de nouilles" to have one's ass circled with noodles= be very lucky
"parler anglais comme une vache espagnole" to speak English like a spannish cow =having bad english
Some of those are the exact same in French (“like an elephant in a porcelaine shop”, for example), or very close (we say “I’ll eat my hat if that happens” for things unlikely to happen, and speak of “the tree that hides the forest” when someone focuses on the details rather than on the whole)
Wonder where that comes from
Funny, I’ve never heard “tirer son plan” in France
I’d have thought that we shared expressions as we share the language
Maybe it’s used along the border
In French we have “il pleut des cordes” (it’s raining string/ropes) for the same purpose
Same in French, but in the negative: “vendre la peau de l’ours avant de l’avoir tué” (to sell the bear’s fur before you’ve killed it)
We usually use it to say “don’t [sell the bear’s fur ...], meaning: “do it before you speak of it”.
We do use “se débrouiller” (and “la débrouille”, noun but same origin), but it’s a verb rather than an expression/idiomatic
Thanks for your explanations
Yes, we use “à tantôt”, for “see you later” (with the underlying idea that you don’t know when this “later” will be)
We have the [*Académie Française*] the French Academy
I thought they were only relevant (sort of) in France, but other comments in this post seems to hint that they are somewhat known in neighbouring French-speaking countries
The *Académie* is an official authority on the French language, but since its rulings are not binding, nobody listens to them
They also have no linguistics expertise (members are mostly authors, and they are often at odds with linguists) and are rather conservative
But since nobody really cares about them, it is not a burning issue in France
Yes, L’Académie Française
The academy was established in the 17th century and has authority on French grammar, vocabulary and usage
I knew about the Office Québécois, and I knew they communicated with the Académie, but I didn't think the Québécois themselves were aware of what the Académie is saying on various matters
As far as I know, the Office is doing a better job at protecting the French language against some anglicisms, but that may be the rose-tinted vision we have from the other side of the Atlantic
Well people don't feel concerned about their decisions, most of them seem out of the touch, but sometimes they are showing common sense, for exemple they declared that the "écriture inclusive" (inclusive writing
) is a danger to the French language, something that I 100% agree on
Basically this style of writing is to put a dot in the end of gendered words in order to include the feminine "e". For exemple, for the word "écrivains", the inclusive writing version would be "écrivain
e.s". It is ugly, it doesn't make any sense at all, and for once I'd appreciate that the french academy would be listened
I think we usually listen unless it’s an obviously stupid decision like this one
“Virus” is masculine so it doesn’t make sense
It’s a virus
Disease is a general term
Heh, Kinda ?
On a subreddit most people seemed to think that, for whatever reason, swiss french and quebec french were vastly different than france french to the point where mutual intelligibility was not a thing
When I told them that it was not the case, I was met with disbelief
Well, now you're just making languages up
Yes and it's very interesting to listen to
Usually very much understandable tbh
It's somewhat common outside the anglosphere especially in France, Québec and french-speaking Belgium
I like the swiss accent, they sound cute when they speak french <3
Great thanks for sharing
Cajun country music absolutely sounds Murican, and at the same time speaks like rural pre-1900 France
weird but great mix of cultures

It's a very poetical french song about the emotional involvement in a relationship

Paris and Marseille have a huge rivalry in footbal competitons and each time their teams have a match against each other you can expect clashes in the streets of those cities between supporters
"Did you know how Bordeaux was created ? We threw our dumbasses into the Garonne, and they stopped just before the ocean" is something that people from Toulouse would say
So we could say that Bordeaux and Toulouse are quite rivals
There are other rivalries in France, sometimes related to football, sometimes related to history
In France it would be Paris and Marseille
It’s a bit of an uneven feud though
Parisian don’t really care, they might just make a joke about the accent
Some marseillais will antagonize you or damage your car for having an Ile-de-France (Paris) number on your license plate
Same here with Paris but in worse
The rivalry is huge in football, but in other fields I don't think Paris takes any "rivalries" seriously
I feel like only people from Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux care about competing with Paris
Parisians are obsessed with themselves only
We also had the Marseille/
Lyon thing going on for quite some times (OL vs OM)
I do believe that it’s less strong that’s days, though
We all know the true opposition is Paris/province (everything besides Paris)
So Bucharestn't?
Tbf there isn't any city that can rival in size or power Paris
France is so centralized that Paris cannot have any rivals
It's the political, economical, historical and demographic enter of France
Nah dude
We have a rivalry with Saint-Étienne, not Paris
OL = Lyon, not Toulouse
The term "province" is so fucking insulting
I always hated it
yeah it’s kinda ridiculous, I don’t get the hate at all
I know there’s some rivalry with football clubs but that level of antagonistic behavior seems hardly appropriate
Lille - Lens
Rennes -  Nantes
And so on
Fair enough
Though from personal experience, Lyonnais are very quick to point out to me how Paris is a terrible place to live in, and how Lyon is Europe's most marvelous city
Woups, my mistake, I’ll fix that
My brain cells connected funny
There's not everything that revolves around Paris
Ask Stéphanois if you want a confirmation that Paris is not our rival
Is this a joke ? Your country militarily occupies a foreign nation and has the gall to say that they are pro unification ?
ah ! true
Many "romantic" cartoon characters with a French accent have an Italian accent in France, because that's the country we see as romantic (main example that comes to mind: Pepe le Pew)
In the Simpsons Willy the gardener has a Norman (If I'm not wrong) accent for his Scottish one
It's funny, all cops in France have a strong southern accent
Couper le conntact et sortez la carteuh grise monsieur
Is "Barbarians" the name of the series you talk about
Oh he's French in the original
I didn't know that
But I guess it makes sense
More than 20 dialects and i am not even counting outside of the "métropole".
All the dialects of French have been wiped out in mainland France
A few examples of dialects **of French** by old native speakers :
- [Gallo] (Eastern Brittany)
* [Lorrain] (Vosges)
* [Walloon]
* [Berrichon]
Someone already asked a similar question [here]
nearly every region of region has its own dialect
Same here, except if you count accent as a dialect
Italy has literal languages
Piemontese, Ligurian, Venetian, Sardinian, Napolitan etc
aren't dialects of Italian
Dialects are often minority languages so many answers to either question apply to the other
At least for France, dialects are minority languages, I don't know enough about other countries but I assume the situation is similar in (at least) some other European countries
Yeah I didn't say it was always the case, that's also why I talk about Europe specifically because the situation in other parts of the world is very different
The  "French" fries
French Wikipedia says it originated from Chinese workers in the US during WW1 while English Wikipedia says the origin was a French military hospital, it's funny
It's like saying Washington or Beijing
Of course the citizen take no part in the decisions
Hey, we didn't do anything
It's not our fault if Americans don't know you exist, no one in France claims fries are French
Not according to the university of Liege
No, they aren't Belgian
Belgians think that they were frying potato stick at the end of the XVII century while potatoes only arrived in Belgium in 1735
Also back then the people were refusing to eat potatoes it was considered food for animal and it took the convincing of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier through France and Europe to have people eating potatoes
It's generally accepted that people started eating potatoes in France from 1770 and really in 1785, after a famine, where potatoes saved them
So I really doubt that people in Paris were not even considering eating potatoes while in Belgium they were frying them for over a century
The text claiming Belgian were frying potatoes is also non-existant
It's a hoax
Moreover, the fat, oil, animal fat, butter
was a luxury back then
It's extremely unlikely that peasant or poor people will have used it for frying
Most of sources point to a Parisian origin
And it was introduced in Belgium by a german ambulant seller during fare
[  (and this is written by someone from the University of Liège
French fries is actually really french
I was curious about it and looked it up, and it would seem that noone really knows whether they are belgian or french
They are definitely more of a "belgian culture" thing, but noone truly knows if they were born in Belgium
**SOPHIE MOENS —** **Et à cette époque, il y a des pommes de terre frites en Belgique ?**
PIERRE LECLERCQ — Non, pas encore
Aux alentours de 1842, un immigré bavarois du nom de Frédéric Krieger travaille dans une rôtisserie à Montmartre et apprend à y confectionner des frites40
En 1844, il s’installe comme forain en Belgique et ouvre la première barraque à frites du pays
Pour faire sa publicité, il annonce des « pommes de terre frites à l’instar de Paris » et insiste sur le fait qu’il a fait son apprentissage à Paris
C’est à partir de cette date que les Belges découvrent la frite qu’ils accueillent avec beaucoup de bienveillance
Krieger, qui s’est fait surnommer « Monsieur Fritz, le roi de la pomme de terre frite » fait d’ailleurs fortune et inspire un grand nombre d’émules
So the first "barraque à Frite" in Belgium was opened by a Bavarian who learned how to make fries in Paris and was called "Pommes de terre frites à l'instar de Paris / Parisian's art potato fries"... ;)
You guys blame North Macedonia to be called Macedonia though, doesn't that fit the thread ?
I met a Greek in Brussels, he seems too angry about that considering that now they changed their country name
they're insane with it
Once I went to Sweden and my friends were packing alcohol in Denmark in prep
I was like "meh, it's Sweden, they'll have alcohol
"... well well well
Turns out that in supermarket they only sell light alcohol, no more than 3
5%. So you can't even buy a normal beer in a supermarket
You have to go to special liquor stores, which could be hard to find, especially if you're outside a city, and it's much more expensive
Same for bars, it's super expensive
and they have rules of not drinking outside or stuff like that
Luckily my friends forced me to pack some alcohol too
Another time I was in Norway, same shit
We sat on a terrasse, got our beers served and then we decided to move to another side of the terrasse (better view
I don't remember why we moved), but we had to walk like 5m on the street for it
The waitress ran at us, and was like "what are you doing, you can't do that
"... the problem was that we were on the streets with alcohol
On the bar's terrasse it was ok, was considered private, but on the street no
Only the waitress was allowed
So she took our beers, we went to sit where we wanted and she carried back our beer to us
In Denmark it's like the rest of Europe, you can get drunk in the street, supermarket sell normal alcohol, bars have normal rules
When people say Brussels they don’t mean they Belgium somehow decided stuff unilaterally, they just mean the EU institutions in Brussels
mais en fait les dernières recherches historique tendent à une origine parisienne de la frite
En tout cas c'est quasi sûr que les frites étaient mangées à Paris avant d'être connues en Belgique
> Everyone tosses the blame amongst the Spanish, the English and even the Dutch, but the Portuguese usually get a pass, for some reason
*French whistling in the background*
I've heard that a alcohol is also crazy expensive in Denmark
edit : Ok apparently I was wrong, you can buy cheap alcohol in Denmark
I'm just being flippant
The whole "freedom fries" thing was just kinda hilarious from our perspective, considering everyone in France knows (or thinks they know, since there appears to be conflicting evidence) fries to be Belgian

Greeks and arabs haven't had anything to do with one another for like 700 years
It's been greeks and turks since then, and turks use a latin alphabet
So, I don't know where this whole idea comes from
Greek alphabet is pretty different from the arabic one too
It could look cyrillic to the untrainef eye, maybe ?
Is there a school subject that seems to only exist in your country
Or on the contrary, one that seems to exist everywhere but not in your country
For example, France doesn't have "Religious education" classes
Edit: (As in, learning about Religion from an objective point of view, in a dedicated school subject
We learn about religion, but in other classes)
Just to correct you about religion class in France :
We do have it in Alsace and Moselle, due to us being German when these laws were adopted
I've even heard a few times that it is mandatory, and we would have to write a derogation not to have this class, which most people do, but don't take my words on that
In France we have philosophy in high school it teaches us to think rationnaly
You could've mentioned technology we have in middle school, it's a weird subject, there's some learning about industry and production but the teachers seem to all be uninterested
J'ai eu un cours optionnel "étude des religions" au lycée. J'étais dans un lycée privé breton donc c'est peut-être pour ça.
Je suis athée, et pourtant j'ai beaucoup apprécié ce cours
Le prof nous a expliqué les bases historiques et culturelles de l'islam, du judaïsme, du boudhisme, du protestantisme et des sectes religieuses
Si on regarde ce cours comme un cours d'histoire géo, c'était plutôt intéressant de voir l'origine des croyances de 70% de la population mondiale
Le prof était clairement catho, mais n'a pas mentionné une seule fois sa religion
J'ai eu la chance d'avoir un prof "impartial", mais je peux comprendre que ce genre de cours peu très rapidement déraper
Je pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée de l'enseigner à tout le monde
I wish we had this
so many people of my generation (90s) and younger can't cook anything properly or run a house efficiently
Included myself, I had to learn later by myself
That's included in French classes here
We learn about religion, it's just not a subject on its own
We learn about it in History-geography class, in Civic and moral education (or "how to be a good citizen" class) among other classes
We have a mandatory Philosophy class in our last year of high school, which comes after 7 years of studying French literature (replaces it in the last year)
I did orienteering during middle school
The final exam was in a big forest during a heatwave
and we weren't allowed to have water bottles "cause it'll be too heavy and unpractical"...
As in, a subject dedicated to learn about religion from an objective and fact-based point of view
I know that some countries have a subject dedicated to it (as opposed to us learning about religion from an objective and fact-based point of view in subjects like history-geography)
I have trouble making myself clear sorry :(
Dutch people having a bicycle exam is very on brand in my opinion
It's great that you have that, I think that back at my primary school we had something similar
Psychology
This is the first time I've ever heard of a country having that on its curriculum
That's so cool
Here, geography is put together with history (History-geography), and the geography part is basically about what's happening in the world (development of countries, ocean trade, population growth), and we have a subject similar to Earth studies, called "Science of Life and Earth" (biology, geology, climate)
That sounds very fun
Happy Cake Day
I forgot everything I had learned
It was a fun activity though, a nice welcome change from playing rugby in the rain
I know that you still have history and geography classes in other countries (I never once said that you didn't?)
I'm talking about how, in France, we don't have a subject specifically dedicated to Religion, and we learn about it in other subjects (Ethics, history), unlike other countries that have a specific school subject AND ALSO learn about it in other subjects
Objectivity in history and geography classes can be questioned, I wholeheartedly agree
French secularism and France's views towards religions are pretty complicated to explain, and I'm not the best person to do that
Bundt cake in English :)
I should've worded my point better too, then
I didn't want them to be opposed, in a what's better and what's worse manner
I attended a religion class in Germany during an exchange trip there, and I actually really enjoyed it and found it interesting
It made me wonder why we didn't have them here
I really didn't want to imply that Religion classes were bad, or rather less great than other methods
Sorry for coming across as really condescending the first time
Sooo many cities are riding the franco_belgian border
I suppose the opinions on Napoleon will vary a lot between France and the rest of Europe
In France he is seen as a man who defended us against other European powers in a time of peril and as a reformer who gave us our civil code and created an organized state that actually worked properly (both the civil code and his new organization of the state are still being used in modern France) in Europe I suppose he is probably more seen as a warmonger with an inflated ego
Yes, with North Korea, during the WW2
Pretty funny
Same goes for WWII
In France, we are mostly taught how we bravely resisted while other member states mostly focus on us surrendering
He is viewed more positively in Poland, Netherland, Italy
because those are countries that he "freed" from an other oppressor (Russia, Prussia, Austria
He's bashed by the British mostly and by the other main European powers as they are the ones who couldn't accept the French revolution and started attacking us to put a king back on the French throne
Took them 6 coalitions to achieve their goal
heh, why am I not surprised to see this is (and by far) the top comment
It seems all of Europe has something to say about Napoleon
Why do yall want to live in the land of Dracula
I think he is actually born one year after Corsica became French so it was even closer to what you say
Apparently he was often teased at military school for his thick accent when speaking French
I think he kind of sucked when it came to geopolitics though, he basically thought that the only way was to occupy all of his enemy and he completely neglected diplomacy which would have been the only way to ensure lasting peace
I think history would have been very different if had listened to Talleyrand’s idea more because Talleyrand was extremely skilled both at diplomacy and at geopolitics
Except that Napoleon never declared war, always defended himself so I dont see how warcrazy he was
Some things never change :)
It's not a very well known fact I would say
There was so much going on in Europe at the time that the fact he reinstated it in some colonies far from home kind of is overlooked
This is also the origin of the idiom: "drinking like a pole". See at first glance this might seem to be a slightly racist dig at the polish
But in reality it is not
After the battle was over, a French officer complained that the polish soldiers were drunk to try to minimize their exploits in battle
Napoleon would have said: "then you should have drunk like the poles".
Another origin story I read is slightly different
Both Polish and French troops drank a lot the day before the battle
But come morning only the poles were actually fit to fight and the French were hungover
So drinking like a pole mean that you can drink a lot and still be in control
Well, that definitely happened
Ofc de Gaulle was useful and coordinated the resistance to some extent but (and I am being influenced by my grandfather opinion here, not sure how general it is) de Gaulle definitely took all the credit
He was an opportunist at that point
He's also responsible for that "no collaborators in France" and "everyone resisted here" crap
Though, I've never heard anyone else in France tell me this
I think saying de Gaulle took all the credit and didn't deserve it is quite an unpopular opinion (I might be wrong)
One of the worst decision of him
Should have never put his brother on the throne of Spain
That's definitively an unpopular one
Something that's made me laugh is when we learned of the 18 June speech on the BBC WE were taught it's an important point in France resisting but in the end almost nobody listened to this speech
I've found it to be a popular opinion with people who experienced the war, including my father and my grandmother
Baby boomers are those who idolize De Gaulle
I can understand why they do as they grew up in economical prosperity while De Gaulle was in power
No wonder why he was viewed as the savior
Ignorance is not a fault to be forgiven
If you are interested in Napoleon I cannot recommend enough you read about Talleyrand
He was kind of the man in the shadow for several rulers including Napoleon and he is a very interesting character
« Napoleon’s master, a life of prince Talleyrand » is both fascinating and very informative
Like ?
Because we destroyed your team ^^
Napoleon never invaded Britain and the war was started by the British, nice try though
Yes and ? War was declared by Britain, France was justified in planning an invasion (Napoleon never tried to do it, only planned to) I fail to understand your logic
I'm French but basically fluent in English and I can get by in German
I obviously understand those pages, I get bits and pieces of the Dutch and Flemish ones, and am pretty lost when it comes to the Scandinavian ones
I haven't scrolled through it all but am I the only one to wear my best clothes at home
I'm talking about cashmere and silk, which are much more comfortable and luxurious than cotton or god forbid some polyester blend
But when I go out I dress more utilitarian
Sweat pants/tops don't even come in to the picture
In Russia yes but in France it doesn't exist
No, I don't. I put on nice clothes at home just for myself, or just for my family and loved ones
Worn out stuff I wear when painting or doing dirty jobs, and I change back when I'm done
There is a oldish song called « Les lacs du Connemara » that is very popular in student parties for its rhythm
It is basically a song about the beauty of Irish countryside, the resilience of Irish people and of course it has a clear anti English bias
It’s mainly popular for its rhythm since it alternates slow parts that you can sing at the top of your lungs and faster parts that you can dance like an idiot to
La strasbourgeoise and le chant de l'oignon
But tbh nobody would care
We know that our History (in Europe) is drenched with the blood of our neighbors .
[*Le Boudin*] is the official march of the French Foreign Legion
The chorus contains:
> Hey, here is [boudin] here is boudin, here is boudin
> For the Alsatian, Swiss, and Lorraine troops,
> For the Belgians, ain't no more,
> For the Belgians, ain't no more,
> They're a bunch of *lazy sons of a bitch*
This last term is not easy to translate, the French term is *tireurs au cul*, which means “lazy” but not in a nice way
I don't know why the Belgians are aimed here
French here, I don't know about "people sing it anyway" because these songs are not that popular but I think we have a tons of them
I guess that come with the fact that we often have dark humour and in context they are not offensive
Some examples from the top of my head :
A song mocking the KKK with lyrics as if the singer was part of it, by a full white band has a line "Va nous falloir un négro" which translates to "We are gonna need a nigga". Not shocking to me at all but I know Americans tend to be really strict with who can use the n word
Same band has plenty of lyrics with dark humor that are satire
A song about who to take in an Noah's Ark because the end of the world is near "Let's not forget women to repopulate the Earth, and wash the dishes when it will be repopulated".
&#x200B;
Other artists, a "clash" between them (they are friends irl), first one is black and the other is arab :
\- "Your women fantasize on our scent, \[...\], you'd rather stone them to death so they'd rather get dicked from us"
\- "Bonobos only think of fucking beurettes, they neglect their women excised with monkey wrenches" (Beurette are \~ young arabs women)
&#x200B;
Plenty of punchlines use a very well known French court affair in which a known French Singer (Bertrand Cantat from band "Noir Désir") killed his wife (Marie Trintignant) with physical abuse (iirc he slapped her and she fell / hit her head) :
"Truth is a "noir désir" cause when it slaps you it takes your life"
"Shut up or you will be Marie Trintignant-ed"
"You tried to Bertrand Cantat her"
&#x200B;
Some would just be considered rude I guess ? For example there is a song "You got no dad" in which the lyrics are about someone mocking a child who grew up without a father and telling him it could have been worse
Do you know that your anthem "god save the queen", was originally a french song made for king Louis XIV of France "Dieu, sauve le roi", as a get better song made by some nun because he had an anal fistula that wasn't healing
&#x200B;
>The French [Marquise de Créquy] wrote in her *Souvenirs* that a song named "Grand Dieu, sauvez le Roi
" ("Great God, save the King"), with words by [Marie de Brinon] \[[fr] and music by [Jean-Baptiste Lully] was performed in gratitude for the survival by [Louis XIV] of an [anal fistula] operation
(The surgical knife purpose-made for the occasion is on display in the [Musée d'histoire de la médecine] Créquy claimed that the tune was later plagiarised by [Handel] and so adopted by the British as "un de leurs air nationaux". (The entire story might have been intended as a joke
) After the [Battle of Culloden] the Hanover dynasty supposedly adopted this melody as the British anthem
A different song, "[Domine, Salvum Fac Regem] ("Lord, save the King"), was the unofficial French anthem until 1792
I don't know how true it is, and of course British are denying it is, but I have to say, as a French I love so much to think that the British national anthem might be a plagiat of a song based on an anal fistula of one of our past king, so I'm gonna pretend it's true and no arguments will change that
We also have a few military marching songs that are about fighting the invaders and which are still being taught to recruits today and sung during marches
I will let you guess who the invader in question is but a good clue would be that it is now one of our most important allies
[ here you go
It's basically an anthem to the cold beauty of Ireland and resistance to british
And yes, I can't count the number of times a party has ended on that song, with all wasted french, from 15 to 70 years old, dancing all together, and shouting the refrain of that song unendlessly (we generally make it loop for 15 min at least
[There you go !]
Generally we grab our friends by the shoulders and jump around like drunken idiots while singing the lyrics
Basically it's a marching song about loving onion and not  giving it to the austrians, we may call them dogs too
"But no onions for the Austrians,
No, no onions for those dogs"
Pretty spot on description of Finnish though, there
Yep
Yep we do
I've never danced it sobber so yeah I am a drunken idiot when I listen to it
Hey ! Qui t'a autorisé à me filmer ?
*\*drunkenly echoing from France\**
OOOOOH FLOOOOOWeeeeeEEEER of ScooooOOOOOOtlaaaAAAAAAAAND
when will we
*\*shit, what's the lyrics after that ?... oh, whatever
\**
LALA LA LA LAAAAAAAAAAA
Germany
We haven’t had a war with Britain since the fall of Napoleon and the congress of Vienna
I was thinking of Au 31 du mois d'août which is about the British
Sure, it’s your turn being the baddy though
I play CKII and I never seem to stray too far from the Mediterranean
My best games tend to be played around Greece, Egypt, the Levant, Tunisia, Iberia or Italy/Southern France
I enjoy the British Isles too, but I'd say that 80% of my games are somewhere around the Med
I don't really know why, to be honest
When it is independant (CK2, EU4) I try to play brittany but I always rage quit because I get steam rolled
In HOI4 I play Spain for the civil war but as the game without DLC is pretty boring I genrally play Kaisserreich and I generally play the USA for the civil war
I did a CKII playthrough and played as Scotland
Got allied with France obviously
I didn’t finish the playthrough though because I didn’t like that you could not play the battles
I play total war warhammer II now
The great trial awaits
The return of jesus christ, Burgundian awakening
What is the longest city/town name in your country ?
For exemple, in France, Saint-Remy-en-Bouzemont-Saint-Genest-et-Isson (Marne), Saint-Germain-de-Tallevende-la-Lande-Vaumont (Calvados) and Beaujeu-Saint-Vallier-Pierrejux-et-Quitteur (Haute-Saône) are equal with 38 letters each
Don't forget about Niederschaeffolsheim and Mittelschaeffolsheim that have 20 letters each but written as a single word
Yeah I knew about this one
I've already seen Balatonmáriafürdő which has 17 letters while Jászfelsőszentgyörgy has only 16
I bet it was someone's last name
Here we have Y
Came here exactly for this one
Honorary mention to Pfaffenhoffen that is not that long but has 5 Fs
Vive l'Alsace
But Balatonmáriafürdő has more
As a French, that pronunciation is absolutely counter-intuitive
As the first -a in “Arabic”? Let me check the pronunciation of Arabic
Erase that, as the second -a in Arabic
Or, better, as the -a in “girafe”!
Yes, I learned a bit (just a bit
It just so happens that I know those you mentioned) about your prononciation last year, as I had a geography course on arctic regions
No offense but I dreaded oral exams because of you, guys
Haha, you made me laugh with that monsieur
I’m actually a mademoiselle ;)
I never would have guessed the Tour de France was popular abroad, Reddit made me realize it was
It’s a bit sad that we don’t learn much about Norway in class, all I know are bits of mythology, and what I learned last year (but I only learned about the Arctic part of your country)
I’d love to visit one day, though
My sister traveled to Norway a few years ago, and she loved it so much she made me want to see for myself
Yes, what surprised me is that it’s _not_ huge at all in my family
Like, I know lots of people are watching it, and I listen to the records on the radio when I happen upon them, but that’s it
I’m glad you like it, though :) It must have been awesome, seeing a fellow Norwegian win (again, right
I think I remember at least another Norwegian winning before
(I’m more into football and it definitely felt awesome)
Ok, I definitely need to take a look at it more often
I don’t know the name of any of them, nor that of the current maillot jaune, nor (now that I think of it) the name of any French winner
I just know that one
English
And a French guy died of enhancing drugs & alcohol on the tour, and that it ends on the Champs Elysées (learned that the hard way, I was working there two years ago selling ice cream when they arrived
The crowd
I did not expect the crowd
It was super nice seeing them, though, and that day I understood the fame a little)
I know Wiggins and Thomas
Well, I recognize the names
_But_, that must count as something already :,)
I want to visit smaller cities in Belgium and Germany, but maybe seeing Berlin before that could be nice (I already visited cities like Bohn, Köln, Aachen, Düsseldorf)
I wanted to go to Sydney but I have the feeling Australia will be relieving lock down rules pretty late :(
My sister studied there for a year as an Erasmus student and she really liked the place :)
Versailles and more specially the Castle
&#x200B;
To be fair it was the home of the king of France so I can understand why it looks so rich even today so I have nothing to say really
Switzerland and Zurich in particulat it's only 200 km away from where I live but it's crazy how rich it feels being in Zurich
Ahahah i concur
Only place I ever saw someone wipe their ass on the plateforme
she most probably took a shit in the trash can just before
I’m glad that day my instinct told me to take left and not right, otherwise I would have arrived in the plateforme right at that moment ! Thankfully I only saw it from 20m away
From Europe I've seen Irish, Swedish, Ukrainian and Russian plates
I'm from quite a wealthy area so Qatari and Emirates plates are not unheard of
the most exotic i've actually seen was an American plate
As a student I worked at a toll booth, with incoming traffic from Italy (and Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter here)
I've seen trucks with licence plates from basically every country of continental Europe, apart maybe Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia
Even Moldova, Baltics or Turkey (which are really not that rare)
The oddest one I had would be a truck from Kazakhstan
No idea what would his load be to get from that far away
Edit : Thinking again, I'm almost sure I had trucks from Albania several times actually
I saw one car with a Californian plate in Greece and several cars from Guadeloupe, Martinique and La Réunion in France
Last G7 summit in Biarritz, Donald Trump was there and hundreds of CIA / secret service guys too
Never saw that many US plates in France, it was strange
in term of distance
it's France (but from Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana)
That's a hell of a road trip, but it could be fun with the right car and the right people
*Arobase* is more common, you can sometimes find *a commerciale* (commercial a) or the English *at* when spelling an email address
We say "**arobase**" but wikipedia say there's  a fuckton other way you can say it
&#x200B;
In French it's arobase (from the spanish word IIRC) and except for the mails, it is used to describe the price per unit
And according to Google, “Arobase” means “'a' minuscule entouré d'un rond” which means “A circled lowercase a”
TIL I had no clue it had another meaning !
That explanation doesn't explain the name in other similar languages such as spanish and portuguese (arroba)
That comes from arabic arroub to mean quarter
Because French arobase and Spanish/Portuguese aroba were a unit of weight (quarter of 100 ponds)
Source : the actual French dictionary
Yes it is very much used in French
Not really, never heard it from French people, except maybe those who speak English on a regular basis
Generally everyone still says arobase even for email adresses
It was only used for a short period of time; But damn that's useful
Like
8 kiwis @ 70c
that's clear like rock water
I saw it comes from a contraction of "a rond bas". And tbh it make much more sense than the arabic etymology
France > Spain > Any European country > \[...\] > England
I have a very simple cheering system
If England is playing, cheer for whichever team is playing against them
If a European country that is not England is playing against a non-European country, cheer for them
If Germany is playing against another European country, cheer for them (I spent a significant part of my childhood in Germany)
I am a northerner and we tend to cheer for Belgium when France is not available because northern france culture and belgian walloon culture tend to be close
I know that the opposite is never true though
Usually I root for Russia
I also like the Germans
Depends
If it's Rugby : France, England (Hubby is a brit after all) , Japan (because they're sweet)
If it's football : France / Spain (please don't ask me to pick one), Belgium, Netherlands, all the others and then
Right at the end
Germany
France obviously
The other french speaking country+Italy and spain
Is it a country that drench schnitzel in gravy
I'll be damned if I ever cheer for Italy though
Nah
France > Belgium > Germany > pretty much anyone > Italy > England
In rugby, France > Wales > Italy > Ireland > Scotland > Southern hemisphere > England
>but after their last World Cup performance I am going to back Croatia next time
What did we do wrong ? Is it the defensive playstyle ?
But not surprised
Oof, yeah I can't cheer for Italy in sports neither, also Portugal since that awful game in the last Euro finals
I was SALTY
>France (not always)
Depends on the weather ?
forbidden love
The look of disgust on my italian roommates when they realized that I (like most french people) took my coffee "lungo" (which is basically italian espresso with a couple big spoons of additional water)
I never dared ask them what they thought about "americano" coffee but I assume they would have broke my nose
You kind of find that in the north of France too
I now live in Lyon after growing up in the north of France and it was a nice change to realize that getting shitfaced and punch the shit out of each other was not the norm here
>Paris is a massive city but its not 24/7 at all
The only thing 24/7 you can find in France are very few McDonald's in the big cities probably
>Then I went to France (Orleans and nearby area) for a year and had to take a day off every time i needed to go to the bank or post office because their hours matched mine perfectly
My lunch break was theirs as well, and when my working hours ended so did theirs
I have no idea how and when people do administrative stuff without needing to miss work
Every French person is complaining about this
It's even worse for the tax office
Mine is open from 9am to 12 and from 2pm to 4pm
That is actually ridiculous
>You put water in your coffee
Do you just eat the beans
Not really popular in France
The standard in France is lungo, I would say second most common is espresso
I am not even 100% sure how I would go about ordering one in a French café honestly
It’s a bit confusing because the maginot line was extremely strong
The goal of maginot line was to force the German to avoid it to win time by presenting a incredibly hard challenge and it did work
The problem was the French high command being retarded as fuck and not covering the Ardennes because it was supposed to be unpassable with tanks
Lmao, good one
Funny I would have said that espresso (or "expresso") is the standard here
At least that's what I get when I ask for a "café" in Paris
Maybe that varies across regions
I think lungo is the favorite in France  because you can sip it with a croissant or a cigarette while the espresso just goes in one sip
Yeah Belgium refused that fortifications be built along their borders which is why it stopped right before the Ardennes
"Pregame" in French because we copy way too many words from the other side of the sea
I generally do that nowadays, I just order a double espresso
It’s twice the price though since it’s basically two coffees in one cup
I don't really think about Andorra and Monaco (those are the two I'm the most familiar with so I'll only talk about them), it's more of "ah yeah right they exist" feeling
At least I know some stuff about Monaco, like Grace Kelly, the royal family, casinos, pretty sure it's a tax heaven, and I think there's a car race there
but like I know nothing about Andorra besides the fact that technically whoever is President of France at the moment is the co-ruler of the country, and it's probably also a tax heaven
I don't think about them
At least they are just tax heaven so parasite
I don't think about them often, to be frank, except Malta which I visited twice and loved
It's nice that there can be little states which live free from much bigger countries right next door
I wonder how they didn't get invaded and annexed in the course of History, that alone is some interesting topic to research
What about former microstates
A peculiar one is the **Republic of Mulhouse** in Alsace, it was independant and Republican from 1347 until 1798, when it asked to be incorporated into France, under military pressure of course
Beyond my loathing for the Vatican, I don’t really think about them
that we should annex any French-speaking microstates, especially those that serve as tax havens
They're little more than tax havens for the most part
I live close to Andorra, and I've been there a few times
I've also been to Luxembourg
Only thing that I feel about them microstates is why do they even exist ?
Dude, Luxembourg is huge compared to the other states you mentioned
We are not a micro state
All micro states fit in our country and more
Just check a map
Luxembourg is not a micro state
I live just next to Monaco, I go there sometimes, but I never met someone on the Internet who's actually from there lmao
Luxembourg is not a micro state
Much bigger than all micro states and we can survive on our own, except maybe electricity
Where most micro states import nearly everything
It is actually cited as the last genuine city-state today
City-states probably also are micro-states for the most part
I don't think much of it except that gas is gonna get more expensive and that's annoying, but people believing it's actually gonna trigger some kinda WW3 are just delusional or just wish to see something big happening during their lifetimes, unfortunately it's not gonna happen just with that
It will be a repeat of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars
The US will spend trillions of taxpayer money, thousands of Americans will die, tens of thousands will deal with injuries for the rest of their lives
Hundreds of thousands of locals will die
Most Americans won't care and most, even after 10 years, won't be able to point at Iran on a world map
I hope France does a repeat too and tell Trump to get fucked
It will mess up the region even more
I think that it would be nice if the US could just stop trying to make war with everyone and start looking at how to improve the things that obviously malfunction in the country
If you guys were to put the army money into, I don’t know, education or healthcare, don’t you think you would be slightly better off ?
"may have"? It sure does look like it
even the US are saying they did it
>the cynic part of my brain thinks how convenient it is, starting something that could Lead to a war or fights for us troops (on foreign soil, not in the usa) with the upcoming elections and then the voters have to rally behind the orange guy and vote for him
Trump would agree with you :  [
I hope so

Was it in the 8th century, or am I unaware of some interesting piece of trivia ? :)
There is no way Turkey is invading you, or anyone else in the EU
Your answer might still be correct (in terms of most likely amongst a bunch of incredibly unlikely options), but still
I would say Brasil, for Guyane

You know, I like the Valle d'Aosta
Do you mind ?
Thanks ! I didn't know that
Wouldn't have happened if you had been in the EU
I'm pretty sure anyway
I think in France the bistrot kinda fit the description
I'd say actually you can find fairly cheap homely British food in pubs, greasy spoons, and "sandwich bars / fry up" places (not sure what to call them)
I read OP’s question as privileging “cheap” over “good”, so pub would do
I have in mind the cafes types everywhere in London that do sandwiches, fry ups, coffee, builders’ tea
Not sure what to call them
*Comme un boomerang* by Serge Gainsbourg
It should have been an Eurovision song but due to tons of issues it was only released after his death
Wikipedia article about all the issues (in French) :
The music :
I don't know whether it's called this but 'Je ne connais pas l'Afrique' by 'M'. Super catchy
Alright, so
I think this is a Finnish christmas song
I have no idea what it's about exactly, but I got the tune stuck in my head since I've seen [this live] (the whole audience singing the song around 2'20 and again at the end is simply haunting)
Finnish sounds so fucking beautiful
Hell yeah !
I'm always up for some Finnish music and litterature even though I dont understand sh
But yeah, when it comes to music, you guys are a few levels ahead of everyone else (and so far, this is turning up to become a nice addition to my playlist, and I'm not even halfway through ! Hasnt yet fully kicked in !)
[... or dream
[... or drunk
Yeah, not for nothing Finland (and the neighboring Swedes too I must confess) has been at the top of my dream-destinations for a while !
... But as a Mediterranean, I fear I might be too loud and extrovert for you guys ! **/s**
There's no accent for Hagrid in the French version, not even a funny way to speak ... I watched the film in french and read the translated book as well but there's literally nothing on his way of speaking
But I read from an interwiew that apparently, the official translator decided not to retranscript any accent in french cause they don't want people to feel offended that a character would use their accent and that it would be made fun of
(from what i understand)
Which probably would happen cause in France, somehow, if your accent is different from the flat parisian, most of the time it's seen as a joke and it's a common thing in medias to laugh about it than to accept and appreciate it
He didn't have any accent but he did sound a little gruff but in a super-cute-big-bearish way
He didn’t have an accent in French, but he had a "big man" voice, if that makes any sense
Totally unrelated to Harry Potter, but in one episode of the new Lucky-Luke cartoons, one episode has a Scottish rugbyman come to the prison
Well in the French audio, they made him speak with a south-west accent (think Bordeaux and such), because that's where rugby is the most popular
So you've got this guy dressed in a full kilt, speaking in the chocolatine language
Translators are fun people sometimes
100%.
I usually hate French version but the Harry Potter one is pretty amazing I'll admit
I can't quite grasp of it's a good thing for you that his middle name is Elvis, but we've also changed his lastname
Correct
They had to change it because otherwise it would have been « Elvis » haha
It’s just a fun fact
We generally call it an "antisèche" wich litteraly mean "anti-dry", to dry is a slang for "to don't know".
Une "anti-sèche" which translates literally as "anti-dry".
Here, the dry spell obviously refers to the mental desert you find yourself in when you can't remember something
As per usual in France, we have many terms for them
The most usual when I was in high school in the beginning of the 00's was a "pompe".
And as usual, pompe as different meanings, it is either a pump or a slang word for a shoe
I think here we use that term because you pump the answer from your piece of paper, I assume
For video game we say « soluce » which is short for « solution »
Also anti-seche, at least it was what our teacher called this when they allow you to bring a single sheet with your own written notes for the exam
I had lockers in middle school and high school, but I think it's school-specific
And, at least personally, I didn't really use them for anything
I couldn't leave textbooks inside because I'd need them at home for homework
We had but I always have been really bad at picking the book at the right time so I ended up almost not using them until high school
When I was 9 I had some days where my backpack weighed 18kg
We did have lockers but we didn’t use them for much because we needed to take our manuals home to do the work anyway
Only in some years in high schools did we get some books in duplicate so as to be able to leave one at school, that was cool
We did in middle school but not in high school because there just wasn't enough lockers for the whole school (middle and high school were in the same location)
In middle school science class we weighted our backpacks once and mine was 7kgs, I was about eleven
I went to 2 middle schools and 2 high schools and none of them had any lockers, I always assumed lockers were a thing you only see in American series
I guess it depends on the school
Yes, same for primary school
We all have bags (backpacks or crossbody bags, some girls also have large purses) to carry books, notebooks, pens, etc
It gets heavy really fast but I personally always found it easier to carry everything all day, rather than having to walk by your locker all the time to get stuff for the next class
When I was 9, on Thursday my backpack weighted 18kg
France, but to be fair I was an idiot
We had lockers but I was terrible with them and was always forgetting stuff in it so at one point I just always kept everything needed for the day on me
This is yet another case of the English-speaking world refusing to get on the same standard as everyone else and causing people to be confused about what a "billion" is, including even English-speakers, as English has both a "short" system (the one you described) and a "long" system (in which billion means the same thing as it does everywhere else)
&#x200B;
So yeah, to answer the question, we go: million (a thousand times a thousand)), milliard (a million times a thousand) , billion (a million times a million)
Fun fact: the short scale is a French invention
So it kinda is on us
Makes sense
Cyprus is heavily influenced by the English language
How does plural work in Irish
Like I mean is there a fixed ending or is it irregular
And can 2-5 plural and 5+ plural always be distinguished
Haha, I like that you guys straight up avoid the whole "billion" issue by skipping to trillion
Tf your post confused me even more lol
I'm genuinely curious where the English etymology of their versions of these numbers came from as they don't follow the same rule
Actually it's also million/milliard
Shhh, don't you know we only stress we invented it when it's a good thing
Like the metric system and fries (yes, we did invent them Belgium)
Billion can mean two different things in the English-language
That's the confusing part
My bad
America bad
Is that better
A true, sorry I mixed
Cultural biais kicked in I guess
That's pretty interesting thanks
>What do you mean by 2-5 plural and 5+ plural being distinguished
Nevermind lol idk what I was thinking about when typing but I confused Irish and Polish (maybe because of the ish I have no idea lol)
I think the person i replied to had originally forgotten it
Either that or I just misread
That's the spirit
How universal when we are basically saying that a lot of countries use milliard
Because million and trillion don't have "similar sounding endings"?
Seems like you guys have a different definition of universal too then
You're the one who brought up the endings
I don't think it's true we focus more on endings since we do also use billion, trillion etc
but for bigger numbers
You're on an American website use American numbers
Sont bizarres ces rosbifs quand même
Interesting, didn't know that
There's also a huge network of galleries in Lyon's underground, nobody is sure as to when it was built (some parts are from the Roman era) or what they were used for
Then you know it's not really recommended to go there if it exists
On another note: there's a similar book in the same universe but in Saint Petersburg
I only know the title in French (Les ombres de Post-Petersbourg) written by Andrei Dyakov
I highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet
Food and alcohol
Also we have a lot of DJs: The Avener, David Guetta, Madeon, Møme, Bob Sinclar, DJ Snake, Martin Solveig, Kungs, Petit Biscuit
We have a proud and strong striking culture
Our long standing tradition to go on massive strikes whenever the occasion arises
lololol u surrender white flag
France represents 40% of cities in the EU, we like them small and kinda empty
The museum is awesome, the sheer size of the boat is really impressive
Birdy Nam Nam, Gesaffelstein, C2C , Justice, DJ Pone ..
And our unique talent to strike
Same goes for France
And we don't even know we are good at it
It's so weird, like most languages in Europe originate from Indo-European and then there's Basque
Everybody seems to forget him, but there is also  Jean-Michel Jarre, with his huge concerts

5 million people)]

Some do, some don't, it doesn't really mean much
We might say it if there's not a lot of people in the bus and if it's calm but that's it
It's the norm in Toulouse, south of France, but not anywhere else in France as far as I know
Nah
You're exiting through the back anyway, and there are signs telling bus users not to talk to the driver
In my previous time nobody was bothering themselves with it but in the place i live now it's systematic
Don't mess with me OP, I thought everyone there is autistic
Exactly the same here
I'm told by my sister who recently moved to Montpellier that they do thank the bus driver there, so maybe a North v South divide ?
Might be
I live somewhere in the center
It's probably more of a big vs smaller cities
I used to do it in Aix-en-Provence but not in Marseille nor Paris
Never really noticed it in Strasbourg

Blizzard done fucked up
That being said it was a shite situation either way
It was a choice between:
* Don't do anything and potentially lose a huge emerging market
* Punish the guy and lose a ton of public support / get a big backlash
Still, they definitely took the wrong decision and I hope they will come to regret it (and I say that as someone who played their games for decades and still play their games today)
If you want to truly make Blizzard feel your discontent there are currently two distinct initiatives going on:
* [Mass request of GDPR data by all european players] If you don't know it basically means that Blizzard has to gather and send you literally ALL the data they have stored concerning your account, if you have been playing several of their games for any length of time it can amount [to quite a lot of data] (link of a post from a Hearthstone player who requested his data some time ago, it was only his Hearthstone data mind you)
The idea is that processing a few requests is easy, processing hundreds will be very complicated and they get fined if they don't answer within a certain number of days
If even only a couple thousand Blizzard players do it at the same time it will easily overwhelm their legal department forcing them to outsource part of the job or to get fined
Either way it costs them money and they can't not notice the discontent
* Make Mei (a chinese character from Overwatch) a trending symbol associated with Honk Kong protest on Google until chinese censors pick it up
The idea is to force the government of China to ban Overwatch from China, hitting Blizzard asian commercial policy very hard
It mainly involves sharing a maximum of Mei memes from /r/HongKong
Some of these memes are already starting to show up in pretty high position whenever you type "Mei" or "Mei Overwatch" on Google and most of them have been created less than 24h ago
I grew up on Blizzard games
I've played more WoW than I care to admit
I'm not inclined to wax poetic about a gaming company, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a soft spot in my heart for all the great memories they've helped me make
But
My dad was born in Hong Kong
I have family in Hong Kong
And even if I were to ignore my personal stake in all this, Blizzard-Activision kowtowing to Chinese pressure like this is a stunningly overt example of everything I hate most about the world's current brand of multinational capitalism
I personally can't stand Marco Rubio - he's generally a spineless, self-serving prick - but I think he got it right on the money with this [tweet]
> "Recognize what’s happening here
People who don’t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions
China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally
Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone
And it's not just the U.S. - this is a global issue
It's like what's been going on with Huawei, Chinese investment in Africa, or the Belt and Road Initiative
I don't want this slow-creep of Chinese influence to erupt into vitriolic anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment, but neither do I want to see it slowly give way to allowing the dystopian, authoritarian, and utterly corrupt Chinese government to dictate our new societal norms
Anyways, Blizzard-Activision seems to be content prioritizing its market share in China over all of this
Fine
They're welcome to take their RMB over my €, but they won't be getting both
I'm glad you're edgelording your way into this, explaining capitalism to us peasants
Thanks you for you insight, oh wise one
Other than the other thousands of them making up 80% of Reddit right now you mean ?
Yeah, it's just a repost of some bad copypasta that's been picking up traction in other threads around Reddit with the recent uproar
It's incredibly annoying because it both diminishes the gravity of Blizzard's actions while also putting the focus on gamers instead of people whose lives and freedom are quite literally on the line
Don't let your dreams be memes, folks
Seriously, come up with some better dreams
I like Czechia
Why is no one talking about Croatia ? How it extends next to the sea, but still goes inland
can i start a war if i say schnitzel is like a milanese scallop, or a cordon bleu, or torikatsu ? Or is it not controversial like hummus or fries are ?
Idk, Napoleanic France kinda goes everywhere, it's got these little bits of territory that poke out of it
Napoleonic France borders sometimes makes me think of HOI4 peace deals
"Hey let's have Croatia cause it looks cool anyways"
Can you give information on that ? I'm curious !
are UK idding us ?
That's kinda wholesome
This is absolutely the best time for European unity
Betrayed by the USA and a shameful policy by the Turks
This is the best time we will get, get EU leaders talking about military; Turkey is not more powerful than France, this is the best chance we will have to show if the EU has any say in any international affairs
Our military and political ties must strengthen within European countries, and weaken with states like Turkey and the USA
NATO needs to be widely re-imagined, and if the USA does not change it's tone to European and middle eastern politics I don't see how we can keep on relying on a military organization which gives this much power to American and Turkish politics
Trump is right, we need to spend more on our own military, a military which excludes them and any other state willing to do the things that we are seeing unravel today
I don't know much about it but we need to stay as far away as possible from this crap
We'll only make things worse by going there
Dunno, for me it's quite a big deal, maybe because I'm a ML but I would like France to retaliate against turkey
Macron received Kurdish leaders at the elysee today that's a start
You'd pick ISIS over NATO
Yes, but that does not mean that Europe is set on a certain, predecided, trajectory
Our continent and countries will develop and change according to ongoing world events and, ever since 2003 for some of us, but at the very least 2016 for the rest of the continent it seems clear that our interests lie with each other, as Europeans, as opposed to across the Pacific
As these changes in foreign alliances change a lot of the way we run our countries (and the EU) will have to adapt, which will probably come in many joint European projects regarding climate, foreign diplomacy, and evidently military power
The invasion of Iraq
Discounting for the accent, I feel that I can spot 90% of the French speaking a language (French included) when I'm not sure of the language, based solely on the lack of tonic accent we have that makes words sound like a long syllable
Most of the time you can tell
Fluent non-native speakers speak with a global English accent which is very different from any English accent from the UK
Besides, as a non-native, we tend to stick to words or expressions that resonates with our words and our language, so people whose native language is Latin based with prefer English words of Latin etymology rather than germanic roots' words
That said, (< an expression I tend to overuse because it's a carbon copy from 'ceci dit'), some non-native speakers can really imitate natives parroting expressions and tones to the point they sound native
Depends, I play a lot online video games and Italians, French and Spanish have a thick accents but Germans, Austrians and Nordic people don't have a strong one when speaking English, in my opinion
It is most of the time very noticeable, because they still have their accent
Plus, English learned as a second language isn’t perfect English, it’s “go-to” English that you can speak easily and that everyone will understand
I am really like to try and identify languages and accents, so I'm not really representative of the whole French population, but I would say I can identify somewhat well if the person is native or not
Except for some Dutch and Swedish people, who quite often have a very good accent and overall level in English (at least the ones I've met)
that last sentence is absolutely hilarious for some reason
Il n'y a voir les arbitres au rugby, on sait presque tout de suite
No I meant only French accents
For instance in this case it would be French people speaking italian that I feel I can recognise easily ; or French people speaking spanish
Though I don't speak the language I can be "oh I bet they're French"
Well on video games online where toxicity is the rule, once the french accent is spotted you got a spam of "hon hon baguette", "omelette du fromage" and so on
Mordre la poussière, biting the dust, but it has more of a meaning of "being defeated" than dying
We eat dandelions by the roots (manger les pissenlits par la racine), but we bite the dust too
We have something similar here
"Manger le pissenlit par la racine" so "to eat the dandelion at it's root"
"Mordu la poussière" also "eating the dust"
Somehow to me, it mostly is used when someone gets a beat up
Not when he dies, perhaps I’m wrong
In French, we say “*rendre l'âme*”, and it's used both for people and objects
It was originally used for people (*to give one's soul back* (to God)), and then for objects, by analogy
Our slight tendancy to strike, protest and revolt probably
We get easily angry and we often demonstrate, and if there's no reason to demonstrate then we create a new one
The fact that protest is a weekend activity , oh and also the fact that we had firefighter that set themselves on fire while T-posing to fight police ! BOI !
I love that, laughed way to hard at the third paragraph

I tend to eat a lot for a French person my age
My exchange trip to Germany was so awkward because of that
Like I was still hungry, but at the same time I wanted to be polite
True
I was in both Greece and Germany and yeah, just yeah
In Germany I was fucking hungry all the day and in Greece I thought I was gonna explode after each meal
And the world wins every time
In France we have  similar prices (my plan is 9
99€ for 60gb; I used to have a 2€ plan with 50mb when I didn't use the Internet that much on my phone
) When I saw the prices of American plans I was so sad for them
Carbonated EVERYTHING
I was traumatised when I went to Germany at 13 and was served a carbonated apple juice after I ordered an apfelsaft
Szeretnék odamenni mert olyan gyönyörűnek néz ki
As a French, a lot of the revolt don't click with me, but i very much prefer seeing my people revolt over next to nothing than not being able to revolt at all
Yeah it's a good thing, but also an already made excuse for the government not to listen "whatever we do, they'll protest".
yeah tell me something new
Equally admired and despised is my experience
I thought a cute euphemism was the way to go here :)
Yeah why

My parents told me the portions were huge there (but they didn't observe other people so maybe nobody ate all of it and you were supposed to leave the plate half full

La marseillaise sounds good but it's kinda hardcore and way too martial nowadays
"May an impure blood water our sillions" it's kinda hardcore
It's nice, but we usually only know the first verse, and I think it's a shame
I really love the music but not really the lyrics; personally, I would replace it with "Le chant des partisans", which I found really beautiful and have better lyrics in my opinion
I hate it
Our anthem is a war song
It is sad and violent
At least it's not boring !
That's why it's good
I agree but at the same time it’s a good celebration song !
That's why it's so great ! What's even better is that, at least the short part that we sing, does not mention our enemies by name, so it can be appropriated to whoever the "enemy" is
If you listen to some of the other martial songs of the period many of them mention our enemies by name which would make it much harder to sing since our enemies then are our allies now
Brittania Rules the Wave is great too
Never forget:
I disagree, it reminds us of our past and it "teaches" a sense of patriotism which a lot of people tend to lack of in our country nowadays
Plus it is easy to sing, so it is a very good anthem in my book
> It is sad and violent
It reminds us of the harsh reality in this world
We are not living in the wonderland
Yeah, singing "let's kill Germans"  in our anthem would be pretty awful
I understand your opinion
I think we already know our past through history classes, and with a joyful anthem we could also feel united and patriotic
Thanks I'm not dumb - I mean that for a country anthem I think it's inappropriate, that's all
For me, we should be singing about something else than war
I wouldn't laugh if I were you, or you'll end in someone's basement

Never seen less than three (at the beginning of the summer, I think that’s when the number of variety is the most limited), and the variety differs
We often have goldens, galas and
I think it’s the Braeburn
That, or the Fuji
In winter, it can go up to 10 different kinds
And I’ve once seen a guy, at the local marketplace, whose only product was apples
He had more than 40 different varieties
I was amazed
(Those 40 were only the ones he had at the time, depending on the season he’d have others)
Between 4 and 10 depending on the season in the organic shop I go to

Didn’t know such a thing existed, we French people are kind of strange when it comes to cutting cheese -it’s a ritual, really
In French sprays are sometimes called « pshit » and it is 100% because of the noise it makes
In French, the usual way to say "to poop" and "to pee" is *faire caca / faire pipi
* I guess it sounds normal to them, but the syllable reduplication always makes it seem really childish to my anglophone ears -- like saying "make poo-poo" or "go pee-pee".
Little fun fact, in france walkie talkies are called "talkie walkie"
Toilet paper in French is papier toilette
However it's way too long so people use PQ
Literally papier cul = ass paper
I guess it can be pretty childish
In French, some people (including my father), use the term "pilou-pilou" to describe soft, fluffy, fleece-like fabric
It somehow manages to sound both incredibly ridiculous and perfectly appropriate
In french, cotton candy is called *"barbe à papa"* which literraly means *"daddy's beard"*
*Pshit pshit* is more common where I live
Sometimes
No you mean all the time
I have never heard anyone in my life say « vaporisateur »
Fwuck you, meanie
>it sound like a 3 year old using an already childish word
Well yeah
that's kind of our definition and use of english
Isn't english sole purpose to allow the disabled french speaker a way to communicate ? I'have been lied too ?
My former boss, who is German, hates the word handy

"brumisateur" for the water bottle thingy in summer but that's not exactly the same
Un because it’s male for some reason
We say *le pshit* just like *le Big Mac*
Does she speak french ? Because in France we use "fute-fute" to say "futé" (smart, bright)
*Il est pas très fute-fute, non ?*
*He is not really bright, is he ?*
No, even in France we say "téléphone" and not "GSM" it's typically belgian
Yes it is
We have other words for candy (like *sucreries*) but nobody uses them
That's Quebec for you in a way
There is none, we just don’t a neutral gender so we have to attribute a random gender to every word
I understand how it can be seen as ridiculous though, especially since latin did have a neutral gender
And all the french IT guys despise those people trying to force stupid neologism created from nowhere, most of them by a random women in Quebec
Literally anyone who's kind of comfortable in English does this all the time, and I mean all the time as in basically every single sentence
In French an example I have is saying something is "not normal" to say something's wrong or off
The explanation for that mistake is that the word for French speakers and the word for the inhabitants of France are the exact same in French : "français", so we instictively translate "français" by French but it only works half the time
That's not correct in English
Ah, makes me think of José Saramago
Amazing author *when read in Portuguese*. Reading the English translation is unbearable, what with his unhealthy addiction to commas
It is
It breaks the flow of speech

We have "romans noirs" (black novels) for detective stories, but I believe that’s as far as colors go
Our crappy novels are called "romans de gare" (train station novels) because that’s the type of book you find in train stations book shops & never read otherwise, haha
I don’t think we have an equivalent for the press
Noir for dark novels or movies, of course, and "rose" (pink) for romantic or suggestive  novels, or tv series, less for movies
For the press, no colours
One colour related anecdote though, the leader of the Tour de France cycling race wears a yellow jersey, because the historic sponsor of the race was the sports newspaper L'Équipe, which was, at that time, printed on yellow paper
Italy El Giro leader wears a pink jersey because La Gazzetta dello Sport is printed on pink paper
For yellow press (I heard prensa amarillista in Spanish), we just say presse à scandale or tabloid
"Romans à l'eau de rose" (Novels made with rose water) for the clichés romance stories
In french, there is the [Louchébem] that was used by butchers not to be understood by others:

verlan of *l'envers*:
L'envers -> vers - l'en -> verlan
You forgot the [Parisian argot] and the [Javanais]
When I was in middle school we also had "langue de feu" (fire language/fire tongue)
Same as the bird language described by OP but with F instead of V. It was in the early 00's though, I don't know if children still use it
My aunt and mother once told us at a family gathering they used to speak French with those rules exactly ! It always struck me how fast they could talk while adding so many f's in their words haha
To be fair, before being introduced to the specific words, verlan can't be understood, even by native french speakers
For example "toncar" which is used in weed joints as a filtration material is just a *carton* (card board) piece which has been folded
There's no way you could make the connection before knowing the whole shebang
Not giving up nearly our entire territory in North America for fucking Haiti might have been a good idea in retrospect
The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
By the Edict of Fontainebleau, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches, as well as the closing of Protestant schools
This policy made official the persecution already enforced since the dragonnades created in 1681 by the king in order to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism
As a result of the officially sanctioned persecution by the dragoons who were billeted upon prominent Huguenots, many Protestants — estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 — left France over the next two decades
They sought asylum in the United Provinces, Sweden, Switzerland, Brandenburg-Prussia, Denmark, Scotland, England, Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire, the Cape Colony in Africa, and North America
On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV himself claimed that out of a Huguenot population of 800,000 to 900,000, only 1,000 to 1,500 had remained in France
The Edict of Fontainebleau is compared by many historians with the 1492 Alhambra Decree, ordering the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain; and with the Expulsion of the Moriscos during 1609-1614
The three are similar both as outbursts of religious intolerance ending periods of relative tolerance, and in their social and economic effects
In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a kind of early brain drain, as it lost many skilled craftsmen, including key designers such as Daniel Marot
Upon leaving France, Huguenots took with them knowledge of important techniques and styles — which had a significant effect on the quality of the silk, plate glass, silversmithing, watchmaking, and cabinet making industries of those regions to which they relocated
Some rulers, such as Frederick Wilhelm, Duke of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg, who issued the Edict of Potsdam in late October 1685, encouraged the Protestants to seek refuge in their nations
Not getting Pétain as president, but instead someone that would have not collaborated with the nazis
That France (as well as the UK) should have moved earlier in WW2, to help Poland
We failed them
I know we are responsible, but I still blame the UK (the government I mean, people and government are 2 different things) a bit for not helping when we asked for it, there was no way for us to defend ourselves either after what we lost during WW1
We were so close to greatness so many times
Franco-Spanish union in the war of the Spanish Succession ?
Napoleonic Europe ?
Fuck Prussia, all my homies hate Prussia ?
Put an artillery in the Ardennes to stop the Germans ?
The list is so long
Either the 1789 revolution failed (don't kill me yet) or Louis XVI successfully reached Montmédy (where loyal troops where waiting for him) just to see what would have have happened to France
Maybe we would still be a monarchy
Maybe we would have had another revolution
Maybe Napoleon would never have come to power
Then, no Napoleonic wars
So many changes in history might have occured, it would be quite interesting to see what would have happened
Indeed, this one was unlucky
In Camargue (south of the country) there are [the guardian] , mounting the Camargue horse and working with bulls and horses alike
Medieval knights I guess, there are plenty of famous ones
Also the Dragons, a light cavalry unit under the monarchy, were notoriously used to restore order in rebellious regions by living for some days in people’s houses
Mousquetaires also were famous royal bodyguards
Not a archétype, but in britannia (in France) we got
Zaout = Cow
And zaouter = Cowboy
I know that cause that the name of a mate
I would say medieval knights, especially [The Templars] famous knights of a Catholic military order protecting pelgrims during the crusades
They have a lot of legends around them, such as : "There have been speculative popular publications surrounding the order's early occupation of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there, such as the quest for the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant". Even today, people are still looking for their treasure
Yup, these are our cowboys
They are literally cow
boys
I’d say medieval knights are what most ressemble OP’s description, as well as mousquetaires
Children playing would typically impersonate these, just as they would impersonate cow-boys in the USA I guess
Where is your friend shopping
I live in France and I've been in Paris and in the rest of the country this summer, and I've only ever seen these 50 disposable masks packs being sold for 25€ to 29
99€. I even believed the government had capped the price
Before the crisis a mask costed 8 cts each and now it increased up to 95 cts
Si t'en as plus d'ailleurs, y a une épicerie asiat (Koozo Mart) rue de Lappe à Bastille qui en vend 50 pour 10 ou 15e, j'avais halluciné en voyant ça.
That's absolutely possible
That's true, in the early stages of the pandemic, France didn't have enough masks for everyone (because the stocks hadn't been renewed by the government/the local administrations) and they were only for medical professionals and sick people
We ordered a billion masks from China and then there was this whole thing where other countries were paying more, so the production that was supposed to be for us was redirected elsewhere (to the US and Germany from what I remember but don't quote me on that) so we took a while to finally get masks
But now they're sold in every pharmacy and supermarket
Yeah, at the beginning of the pandemic we didn't have enough masks (we used to have a massive amount for the last pandemic but when it was time to renew the stocks, the people on power were like ":/ that's expensive" so they never did)
The few masks available in March/April were only for medical professionals, so you had to get them online of you wanted some and there was a whole alternative market there
But now they're available in every pharmacy and supermarket and I've never seen them being more expensive than 30€ for 50 disposable masks
(It's not cheap either but a bunch of places give out some reusable ones for free - I know my city sent a reusable mask to everyone back in May)
That's the first time I'm seeing someone on Reddit who live in my city lmao
In France  my students mostly know the picture of the presidents/prime-minister /dictator
Not much else
France wasn't even invited to Yalta
This Western Betrayal thing is so interesting to me
I still can't figure out if it's Russian or US propaganda, but I found it fascinating how much it's believed and how much it's wrong and very very over simplified
Exactly the same in France
>The French Army would defend on the right and advance into Belgium on the left, to fight forward of the French frontier
The extent of the forward move was dependent on events, which had been complicated when Belgium ended the Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920, after the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland (7 March 1936)
Add to that the fact that US condemn France and Uk to invade "neutral" countries
You get the "phoney war".
So technically France had to wait for Germany to invade Belgium to launch offensive
UK had the same issue because their plan was to invade Norway to cut Germany steel supplies
but they had to wait for Germany to invade first before to be able to put there plan into execution
So the beginning of WW2 is Germany putting her plan into execution while allies have to fight with a major trade partner, who has huge business interest with there enemy
remember Germany never paid back nor France nor UK what they ought them from WW1, they only paid interest to US investor who lended them money to do so
Don't forget, business is business
Swiss direct democracy & German bottle recycling system
French protests are often pretty violent and sometimes have questionable motives, especially lately (like homophobia for example in La Manif Pour Tous, or some yellow vests wanting Macron to die)
They often look more like riots than protests
And they cause a lot of damage to property that people have to pay with taxes
I doubt you'd really want that
Swiss direct democracy is working well because Switzerland has a relatively small population
Trying a direct democracy with a population of 65+ million people is suicidal
We expecting a fourth defenestration in Prague
Oh, so the nice version of "Mediterranean people are lazy", got it
You know, sadly politicians still do whatever they like here
Many recent protests aimed at the government were only meant to categorically refuse any kind of change, sometimes using violence to make their voice heard
Both sides are awful
I wish we had more direct democracy in this country
But trust me, French riots are definitely not the right way
It doesn't work and it only creates more hate and division
American what now
No, you got it wrong, Robespierre got them removed was nicknamed the Incorruptible
But then thermidor happened
We have TV pundits and news host insulting Greta Thurnberg for having drinked from a plastic bottle once and telling her to shut up and let the scientists talk ( while not letting the scientists talk much)  mainly
Et vive la France
Depends who you ask honestly
Southerner would tell you it’s Pastis, a aniseed alcohol commonly drunk with water and ice
Normandy would tell you it’s Calvados, some apple tasting hard liquor
Northerners are fond of Picon, an orange flavored alcohol that is generally enjoyed mixed with beer
Behold the glorious drink of the montains : [Génépi] ! Every centenarians of Savoy's secret of longevity !
I won't say we have a national one but each region has is own
For exemple it will be calvados in Normandie (wich is of course the best one)
Cognac, Armagnac, poire, prune ... There are just too many and no one got to be THE national one in france
So you've tested grass before ?
I vote for the homemade eau de vie your grand parents make themselves and serve at Christmas with an alcohol content that would not pass a health and safety check
And there are many many others, like Chartreuse (my favourite), Cointreau, Cognac
In my 15 years in the nord, I've never had picon
When I first arrived here, people wanted me to try genièvre, which I've since associated with the north
And the cider from Britanny
Lol alcohol for a bad stomach XD
Beton <3
Mandatory [*Les bronzés font du ski*] and [*Les tontons flingueurs*]
Aka la niole or gnole or gniole there is no spelling for this
Depends where your grand parents are
My grand father in French Catalonia made his own pastis, I've found two bottles in the village
Ever had a Norman hole
I know that sounds absolutely filthy, but it's very good: apple or pear sorbet with Calvados
In French, it's called un trou normand
You spelled Normandy wrong
Cognac is mostly used for cooking as far as I'm aware
I feel like gniole is the right spelling
Pear seems to be very popular
Have you tried it in hot chocolate
It’s the ideal winter drink
Chartreuse in hot chocolate
Holy shit
I need to try this
enjoy
To write not really because there is no need to conjugate verbs or to be careful of the gender of the words
But for the pronunciation yes it’s still really hard
Well, English is basically composed of French words with an accent and without conjugaison
So pretty damn easy
English is pretty easy to learn
It's probably why it is so used today
It's made even easier by the massive abundance of english spoken media
By far the simplest language in Europe, at least from the standpoint of a native French speaker, aided by an absurd amount of material permeating passively everywhere
I genuinely think of english as one of the easiest language out there
The grammar and conjugations are so easy
The only difficulty is that it is phonetically inconsistent, and even that is easy to pick up
On a personal level, not that hard
* Written English was not a big effort, because of the shared vocabulary with French and the simple sentences patterns
* Spoken English was (still is) where the challenge lies
There are quite a lot of phonemes which have no equivalent in French, so speaking English without murdering the pronunciations required lots of effort, and I still have an heavy accent
Listening is fine now, even with the various accents
Written English is very easy, pronouncing it right is harder than most though
But it's an easy language as a whole
It's just that people don't practice enough due to everything being dubbed on the TV and internet
I wanted to go watch Frozen 2 in English in my city which is pretty large, I couldn't find a single place
Not even subbed English
It was only in French
Ridiculous
Compared to French, I absolutely believe that learning english is easier
For a language whose root is not the same as that of my native language, it is fairly easy, and much more so than German for instance
>For French I had to go out of my way to find content, which I never did, by the way
If you couldn't find content in *French* of all languages, you absolutely didn't get « out of [your] way ».

No more "I'm italian, my great great great great great great grandfather knew someone from Naple" stories
Discussing about races
That actually works in Italy, I believe
It gives you the right to a free baguette and half a bottle of cheap wine
Just because you great great great great grandfather was Irish doesn't mean you're irish
You can say you're of Irish descent, but straigh up calling you another nationality ? Come on, that's like saying you're a cat owner just because your great great great great grandfather owned a cat in his life : It's dumb
And you don't get "special powers" associated to it, you don't automatically can identify good pasta/pizza just because your great great (...) grandmother got fingerbanged by an italian once
Generations ago my great great (...) grandfather came from a jewish family in the north of Africa and moved to France
I don't call myself North African nor jewish by procurration
I was more referring to the fact that in the US, talking about race is something almost everyone does, while in Europe, most people don't believe in the concept of races between humans, and just bringing this word up makes you look like a racist
So we usually just talk about nationalities or origins
And don't forget fucking stones
Not that many, in fact
Lyons got an 's' for some reason, Dunkirk for Dunkerque (close in prononciation) and Brittany instead of Bretagne (which, in Breton is Breizh)
I can't see any other
The other way around, French have translated many names
London = Londres
Aachen = Aix-la-Chapelle
Warsaw = Varsovie
Cracow = Cracovie
Damascus = Damas
Usually french and engish exonyms are pretty close if not exactly the same
Off the top of my head:
In Italian: Parigi for Paris, Monaco for München
In French: Douvres for Dover, Munich for München
In German: Mailand for Milano (I think
), Genf for Genève (although that one might be equally legit)
Omg Florence is Firenze in italian
I'm on this sub since several month and that's now that I learn this
I though that Firenze was just a boring quite big city that we don't talk about much
Yes, same with Pékin, and Cape Town is Le Cap in French
A lot of Spanish cities are Frenchified but I guess remain understandable: Valence Barcelone Seville Grenade Salamanque Santiago de Compostelle  Saint Sébastien La Corogne Pamplonne Saragosse  Andorre Gérone Murcie (city and province) Carthagène Palma de Majorque
The French people stand united with you
(We call Beijing “Pékin”)
Is it frowned upon by Poles to use the German name of these cities
Don’t forget Marseille, it sometimes has an s for no reason
>	Spain=sfarad
Same etymology as Sephardi
>	France=tzarfat
Is the Jewish patronym Sarfati link to France ?
I think we still say Saint Jacques de Compostelle though
Which is weird, because I work in international logistics, so at work, even with french people I would use Beijing, but otherwise Pekin still stands
Woot, from latin Aquisgrana I guess
Forgot Bourgogne / Burgundy
Normandy/Normandie is close enough
We've butchered English place names a lot (think Thames/Tamise) but it's nowhere near the amount of butchering German, Italian and Spanish names, in fact
You're absolutely right
I got mixed up here
Except for like, 1 in 4 road signs to maximize confusion
Sorry I wasn't clear enough :)
I was wondering what your reaction was when a foreigner use the German name
Bath is still Bath
However I am ready to bet they changed Thames to Tamise just because of pronunciation issues
I think we're slowly switching the [French exonyms] we were using to the English names
Even from this list, Cantorbéry is almost obsolete (only elderly people would use it)
Ah thanks
I really was not sure the correct pronunciation was tbh, and I visited London a bunch of times
There are [mappy
com] and [IGN maps] (National Geography Institute)
Waze for driving (but it's owned by Google) or Mappy
fr for planning trips
We have geoportail
gouv
fr that is a public service and is very (like really) detailed
We don't use it on a daily basis as it's not meant to be a GPS but it's a powerful tool as we can get almost any sort of map from France that exist or existed (yes we can explore 17th century's maps)
We use waze more than google maps for GPS but waze is owned by google
[mappy
fr] used to be a good source for France years ago, but meanwhile google (and their service Waze)  really is now the reference
[IGN] has more niche maps, and I just found out they have a [Google maps equivalent]
I cannot emphasize enough how awesome the IGN maps are
You can see extremely accurate topo maps, XVIII century maps,...
Not weird, most of us think it's the same thing anyway
RU in spoken conversation usually stands for Restaurant Universitaire (at least if you're a student)
I disagree, it's pretty common to hear "L'UE" here, maybe it's a regional difference or something
Yep
Very commun in newspapers
France :
1€ : 1 baguette
10€ : 1 Margherita pizza or 10 baguettes
100€ : 4 meals with deserts and a drinks in an average restaurant or 100 baguettes
France:
1€: one cucumber in a supermarket
10€: 2 good Label Rouge chicken breasts
100€: headphones (like Beats)
1€ : a candy bar like a Mars bar
10€ : a pack of cigarettes
100€ : a plane or a train ticket (long distance)
Well you usually have a buy three get one free discount, so it would be 1, 13, 133 baguettes
>For 1 euro you get a box of soft sponge biscuits with orange jelly and chocolate cover
Pim's ?
You can get a « baguette blanche » for as low as .36€ cents I have seen in some big supermarkets like Auchan
T'habites vraiment dans les TAAF ?
We mean baguette from a craftsman, not the industrial mass produced version (although I would admit I enjoyed the Auchan baguettes way too much when I was a kid)
Ça doit être le cas, si chez lui la tradi n’est qu’à 1 euro (ça fait des années que je n’en ai pas vu à moins de 1,20)
elle est à 1€10 chez moi (Hauts de Seine)
la baguette classique est à 90 cents
J'ai vu récemment des 1
05 et 1
10, 1
00 ca me semble pas trop déconnant
F for pranks between friends
U for the union between us
N is for anytime, anywhere
How the fucking hell can I still remember this perfectly ?
F  pour les farces qu'on fera entre amis : Pranks that you do with friends
U pour l'union entre nous : The link between us
N c'est pour n'importe ou n'importe quand au fond de l'océan : Anywhere and everywhere in the ocean
EDIT : [ Why the fuck do I remember this and the exact wording after 15 years and still can't remember my bank account password ?
Au fond des océans
We have some very talented people, and also a very small pool of voice actors that are fucking everywhere and have the most annoying voices
I found Spongebob so fucking cringe and unfunny when I was younger
I still do, but at least I don't want to punch the screen when I hear the voices anymore
we learnt cursive
Later most people write with a mix of cursive and printed
Pretty much only cursive
Cursive first, and much later, printed
between 7 and 12 yo i learned cursive
In my school, some kids write printer like, and some write in cursive, including me
All of the teachers write in cursive
But every documents in digital boards or on paper are written printed like
In kindergarten we learnt printed script (early 1990s) and then in primary school we learnt cursive in my experience
From what I remember I only learnt cursive and I still mostly write in cursive
But we saw printed everywhere so for some letters I picked up the printed form if it was quicker
I can't really explain it kinda came naturally
Also some students have to because their cursive writing is so bad
In France you can't use a computer in class until university and most of the tests need to be answered with written sentences
Also in high school and college the dissertation (French essay) is still really popular and you may have to write several pages on a subject manually so it’s necessary to write fast
We didn't learn it, we just took it to make our writing style more cool/different
also because it's faster for some letters like the m and n
In Paris you might see someone come up to you with a ring asking if it's yours, they'll tell you it's worth a lot of money but they're nice since you "found it together" you can keep it and give them some money as a way to split the worth
The ring is simply worthless
Also the usual, overpriced tourist areas with gift shops and fancy looking restaurants, that's the case in all French cities who attract tourists
Get away from those tourist areas if you want anything close to authentic
In France, the worst scam I know of is the broken rear-view mirror one
Basically the scammer waits in his parked car in a narrow street
When some expensive-looking car pass in front of them they blast the horn, or go out out of their car and knock at your window
Then they show you their broken rear-view mirror and tell you you broke it, and suggest you pay them directly as the repairs are cheaper than the insurance deductible
Don't they just do as if they didn't understand your signs
After all there is not only one sign language
Tasty ? Delicious ? I can understand the distress from feeding from intelligent animals, like pigs, cows or ... octopuses
I don’t eat it and I find eating any animals cruel and unnecessary for me but it’s by no means unusual here
Squid is more popular but octopus is pretty widely eaten too, especially near the south coast
Americans online kicking up a fuss about people eating octopus whilst they happily munch on all kinds of low-welfare, often abused animals is a bit of a joke
It feels weird but there's a lot of things that my compatriots eat and is weird so I'm not judging
And I'm sure there's a region in France where octopus is a typical dish soooo
Meh, show a fish, a real fish with head and tails to an American and he will freak out too
I like it, octopus salad is great
Awesome
And now I’m hungry
It’s common here, you can find it at the supermarket &/or see food seller
We eat them in France, no problem
You just need to be used to it
I understand the weirdness though
They end up eaten by humans, so, not so bright after all
If they were so clever, octopusses on reddit would ask if eating humans sound gross to them or not
And then some other octopuss would argue: yeah but yhey are smarter than monkeys
We don’t do that, I believe, and I find it rather strange
But hey, some people like pineapple on pizza; I won’t judge
We're not though ? You're the one who brought up intelligence into this
Nobody said anything about having any qualms with eating intelligent animals
You know it was a humourous answer, right
What is the "meme region" of your country ?
For example, Florida and Alabama are often "memed" because of the famous "Florida Man" or the incest respectively
What is that region in your country ?
Nord-Pas-De-Calais (or sometimes just the whole north of the country) is our local incest-meme region
It is also the far-right #1 region, which makes it even more fun
Furthermore, the chtimi culture there is still quite strong
(Also Paris when you live outside of it)
Paris
Any cliché about Aosta
I'm suddenly interested in this movement
French guy moving over to Denmark this Fall (found a job there), and one of the things I'm most thrilled about is to finally experience that Dane/Swede rivalry ! From everything I know of it, it sounds epic !
Ah yes the famous *russian minority region*
"United" Kingdom
From what I understood, I don't think that this image is true
The "catapult" (inferior weapon btw) is a too advanced technology for this region
I would have said Bretagne for the alcoholism and independance jokes
And also for the fact the their flag is everywhere for no apparent reason as seen on r/unexpectedgwennhadu
Lille de la tentation
There is also:
\- Corse, for being populated exclusively by terro-independantists
\- Paris, for being populated by assholes and being way too expensive
\- Paris'suburbs, for being a warfield between police and local gangs
\- Marseille, for its mafia
\- Bretagne and Normandie, for their shitty weather
I wonder who decided to create these non existent regions
I think that's a worldwide meme for everyone
You mean Skåne is Southern Sweden ?
Yeah our flag really is everywhere
They even have a fucking sub-reddit for this, that's hilarious
Region name changed recentrly,I believe now it is Grand Nord (Great North)
I think yes,something like that
Maybe "North No Calais", "North without Calais"... I don't even know for sure what it is supposed to mean in french
I live near Paris, I must be a bit biaised on the matters
Pas means strait
Which truly makes no sense as it is, in fact, quite a low region in terms of altitude
It's because highschool students think of the North as "high", which
sigh
You shouldn't let random people choose name for things
I guess we should be happy it didn't end up being RegionMcRegionFace
Good call, thx
Possible
Never thought of this this way
Change a lot of things
Would make sense if it was just the worst curry
Well yeah, that is obviously how people took it
But that's nonsensical,  haut/high and nord/north do not mean the same thing at all
Septimanie would've been a thousand times better than Hauts de France, but I do think Occitanie is the best of the "new" names
Nope, I like my 45 day of paid vacation each year
No, honestly I really would rather go elsewhere, the values and political system as well as the total lack of decent healthcare are a big turn off
Loved visiting it though, people were great and the nature is awesome
Nope
I might visit but I've got absolutely no interest to go there on a permanent basis
The only thing the US has over us is better salaries
And even then their work culture and relationship to the corporate world is toxic
Not a chance in hell
I was lucky enough to be able to move from the U.S. to France about four years ago, and I don't regret a thing
It may sound curt and callous to so quickly dismiss my homeland, but it's really hard to convey just how much more content and secure I feel living on this side of the Atlantic
I'm happy
I live a simple life, and it's been no small amount of work navigating bureaucracy and hustling to get myself situated, but I really feel like I can just be myself and live comfortably here - whereas back at home, the constant anxieties that come with worrying about healthcare, auto insurance, work-related stress, etc
were absolutely hell on earth
I enjoy having friends who pride themselves on being cosmopolitan and engaged with the world around them
I enjoy not having to deal with the prevalence of religion in everyday life
I enjoy being able to be frank and direct, not having to dance around people who feel obligated to be overly chipper and facetious to uphold social mores
I enjoy living in a city rich with art and culture
I enjoy affordable vacations and ample time to use them
I enjoy not having to drive everywhere
I enjoy just being able to drink a cold beer next to the water at the local park on a warm spring day
Living in Europe, I enjoy *life*. I wouldn't give that up for the world
I've lived in the US for a long time on both coasts
I sensed something wrong in the political climate in 2013 and got out
I'm thankful for my own foresight every day since
Live no, but study yes
I mean "comfortable" by the american mentality and the way to live
France is a great country, but still quite socialist in certains forms, that I'm not okay with
My tastes, in music, movies, sports, are more likely to be american than french
I'll love to live during one month in the US, then go back to France, then I'll be able to have an idea by myself about it
I always wanted to travel to the US and do road trips and visit some cities like New York
Then I met my American wife and we decided to move temporarily to the US
I've been here since 8 years now
At first in cities, now I'm in a small town in rural Maine
I love many aspects of the country and the culture, but I do miss a ton of stuff
So I won't spend the rest of my life here
Healthcare coverage, toxic fake workaholic culture, Trump, gun nuts, religious freaks are all big turn offs
It's also a very inward-facing culture, just like France
Of course, U.S.A is such a beautiful and interesting country and I'll be much comfortable
When I was little I really wanted to but the verbal abuse my country and countrymen were subjected to during Bush Jr's Iraq war kinda left a sore spot
Even if I were much wealthier, i wouldn't trade my 6 weeks of holiday for a better paycheck, it's just not worth it
Why would I ever want to live in that shithole of a country where cops butcher  citizens every day, doctors let patients who cant pay die and where elections are bought ?
You're breaking Trump's heart
He wants equal number of Swiss and Norwegians immigrating to the US as the number of Mexicans, even though that number would eclipse Switzerland & Norway's entire population
What is he thinking
25 mandatory by law
14 because i'm supposed to works more thatn 35 hours per week (RTT)
5 thanks to the time I've been at the same compagny (ancienneté)
1 day (this one is bullshit) "local festival" (fête local)
We think it's something we have because years ago an unionist wanted to go to his village festival and we still have it
They are my holiday I use whenever I want
I have the same bank holiday (jour fériés ?) as the rest of France : 11 November, Christmas, 1 of May, 8 of May, 14th of July, 15 of August, Easter Monday
Let's be honest, even if you factor in all the costs of education and healthcare, ***as long as you're average and you don't have anything exceptional happening to you***, Americans still have quite a bit more disposable income
Now whether it is really worth it is another question
I personally prioritize quality of life, which is sadly going down in France
> There are strikes constantly that's so often services like trains, buses, and taxis aren't available
I mean I live in Paris so I think we're the worst at this, but even then, train strikes happen like a couple days a year, buses don't go on strike and taxis might go on strike like one day a year, it's really a non issue
> Pickpocketing is rampant and isn't taking seriously as a crime
Pickpocketing is taken seriously, but most victims are tourists and a lot of them don't even go to the police, and when the police catches pickpockets, there isn't a lot they can do (most thieves are minor, for one)

An American saying Europe has no political diversity
Is this a trolling attempt
You literally have two parties : center right and far right
Not the original commenter but out of the first 25 you have to take them all (although I had 4 days left from last year, but I didn't lose them, I just have 4 more days this year)
All of them, some companies allows you to take them the next year
Sometimes you can get your days paid instead of leaving
But for the RTT, if you don't take them, you lose them
My employer this summer was like "hey, you still have 3 days left until the end of August, when do you want to leave
" with one of my coworkers

In theory I'm supposed to use at least 2 weeks (10 days) as a block during july/august
I've already done without issue 4 weeks (20days) at once several times
But almost all years I still have unused day so before they get wasted I'm not working on friday for 2 or 3 months :D
The public services and health specialists are going to shit, especially in rural areas, and there's an explosion in incivility and "noise" (sonic, visual, intellectual)
That's not even mentioning the entire environment going to shit to the point I'm wondering if I should withhold investing in property and buying in another region or even fucking Patagonia
This is also a thing in France
Basically, you are working one day less in a week
Often it's to keep the kids on wednesdays
For non-French people: until middle school, kids have Wednesdays off (usually for activities)
The drawback is that they stay longer at school the four other days of the week
The housing market in big cities is as bad as anywhere else
Smaller cities are still fairly OK, though
I think if you're smart about it, the best value you'll get is buying around a mid-cized city (in car distance)
No big city problems, affordable cost of living and you still got all the amenities of the modern world
Vert true
We work only 35h here in France and have one of the highest productivity rate in the EU if I'm not mistaken
Well, in some fields (like IT)  we do à lot of overtime though
this can end up in a family discussion where they speak about old thing
i don't have records for younger generation, because i am not too close to them, or "this" didn't happen to my closer 'circle'. But i don't see it as a forbidden subject
I think it's a pretty open subject
My mom has told me about this when the conversation called for it
I'm sure she'd tell all the details to my sister if she asks
It's not a mundane subject (why would it be
It's not every day a conversation calls for the details of giving birth) but don't anyone particularly shies from it
I'm a guy, and I got a cliff note summary of the pregnancy and birth of most my relative, like how fast/slow the labor was
The moment you see your child for the first time, taking his/her first breadth is a magical moment I won't shut up about
For me it would be a good "Quiche Lorraine" or a french taco
France : "[Croque monsieur] It's really easy to make, kids love them too
And you can perfect it with your own taste : specific cheese instead of basic emmental (blue cheese, tome, comté, morbier, et
), garlic and butter, specific ham (smoked ham, etc
), one egg on top
With green salad and vinaigrette of course
For me it's carbonara (with cream, sorry for the sin, italian friends)
[Aligot
] Just look at that glorious, glistening, molten mound of cheesy potato fondu
You can feel your arteries crying out in sadomasochistic pleasure already
Personally though, I'll always be jealous of South Korea and their unparalleled [fried chicken
Honestly ? It has to be two things : a camembert au four (take a camembert, put it in an oven, let it melt, done) with fries or a good old raclette
For most of my generation, probably kebab (with fries, yes I know) tbh
Probably not everyone's choice but mine is definitely a bland baguette
Baguette with a pieces of chocolate inside
It was an after-school classic
My granddad LOVED churros
I’m from Southern France
Every week when my grandma went to the market he would ask for some with powdered sugar on top
I miss him so much :’(
I miss Czech food (and Czech beer) so much
Counting the days until travel goes back to normal again
No pie
Not even a small chicken pot pie or a shepherd's pie
Like, of there's one thing nobody can take away from your gastronomy that's pies
Lot's of 'em
Oooohhh yeaaahhhh
Or Tartiflette !
La Tartiflette
God this makes every long winter night warmer and more homely
Literally never eaten aligot in my entire life
Now I want some
We have this cliché about ice cream, though
Girls are "supposed to" take a batch & eat the whole thing in front of the TV when they’re heartbroken
(Plot twist: we -girls- don’t do that
Nothing beats a kebab at 4 am while drunk
We only speak kebab here sorry
Just say you are from Brittany, the flags are basically the same
There is no eggs in a "French Carbonara", only crème fraiche and lard, maybe topped with some gruyère cheese
I usually do another thing while cooking and would 100% end up with scrambled eggs, so I don't do it
There are some in supermarkets that are surprisingly decent for industrial stuff
It's not the real thing of course but it's decent and gives a good idea of what the stuff is
The best is with a Montbeliard sausage so you can dip small pieces of smokiness into it for maximum pleasure
That's how it's normally served here for too ! It's just that I like to eat some fries with it
Drunk or not, the 4 am kebab is awesome
I'm from Brittany and I approve this message
You should put egg yolk though
Egg yolk is delicious
Hum, I would be so radicla about that
Almost everyone I know put eggs and cream
You need to get the white off otherwise it does coagulate which is normal
If you add a little bit of pasta water, percorino and egg yolks at the same time and stir over medium fire it should not coagulate too fast
If it coagulates it means you left it too long on the fire
You should take it off the fire when you have a creamy, velvety sauce
To be fair that's just what we call it here
It's pretty much unrelated with the original recipe at that point, but everyone in France makes carbonara like the guy above said
It's a "French Carbonara", like there exists an "Hawaian Pizza". It might be heresy to some (many ?), but it's definitely out there
I myself prefer by far the taste of a classic Italian carbonara !
It's far from being as universal as you claim honestly
I did the shitty recipe with cream when I was a student who could not cook properly but the second I tasted the actual sauce I just never went back and I know I am not the only one
In restaurants I would say we on a 50/50 basis between the cream one and the normal one in France
Yeah I'm talking at home, not at a restaurant
It's mostly something for young people and/or people who want to eat something heavy without much trouble, you know, comfort food
It's my analogy for this sub only, to try and not hurt some sensibilities
In France we just call it "Carbonara " or "Carbo".
Germany = Allemange
Netherlands  =  Pays Bas
Noway = Norvège
Cyprus = Chypre
Latvia =  Lituanie
Sweden =  Suède
Switzerland = Suisse
Been looking at the list of all countries to see which one have a completely different name in French and English, i.e., if it sounds different but basically means the same then I don't consider them
So here is the complete list:
* Germany -> Allemagne
in French we call the Netherlands « les Pays-Bas » (literally the Low-Countries) or « la Hollande » but we call the Dutch « les Néerlandais »...
also, even though it’s not really a country but Wales is called « Pays de Galle », I don’t know why
Il like it
Gallum also mean rooster in latin: that's why it's the French national animal
I've always thought it's funny that Germans call France *Frankreich* ("kingdom of the Franks"), which is a bit, well, outdated
and then I learnt that the Greeks (edit: and Greek Cypriots, just saw your flag) call it "Gaul".
Does anybody here call our country "caveman land" or something like that
Or "dinosaur country" while we're at it
Exactly
btw, [UN has 6 official languages] Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish
Wow I never knew that austrians didn't say Deutschland
What's the origin  of Piefkinesien
Belarus: does it translate to white russia ? Do all Lebowski originate from there or ?
Latvia is Lettonie
Lituanie is Lithuania
For the same reason why Spaniards say Alemania and Potuguese Alemanha
>Bheag
Which is that ?
Here is a [chronological statement about use of languages] in UN on Dag Hammarskjöld library webpage
UN creation was about political power, aiming at preventing wars among members
Official and work languages have rather been decided on such a political basis than an economical one or number of speakers, at least at first: example with Chinese language, chosen from the very beginning but at the time related to Taiwan who was then a member of Security Council,  and not regarding mainland China
Ok, what does "little britain" represent the
England ? The easternmost island ?
yes, my bad
woooow okay
There is a very old French pun (hundreds of years old) that has been used by hotels/auberges
It's "au lion d'or" meaning at the golden lion
It's a pun as it sounds like "au lit, on dort" meaning in bed we sleep
Many hair salons in France do that, too
I don't know if it's real, but I saw a photo of one apparently called Niktam Hair
Nique ta mère being French for "fuck your mother".
Au Bureau is also a common name for bars in France, but it's the same franchise that's present all accross the country
[*La Légende des siècles*] (The Legend of the centuries/the ages) is a massive collection of poems (more than 25k verses) by Victor Hugo, described as the last French epic, in which Hugo attempts to describe humanity journey "from darkness to light" through myths and historical events (or rather, the vision he has of them)
Maybe [Les Misérables] de Victor Hugo or [Les Mémoires d'Outre-Tombes] de Chateaubriand but those are from XIXe century so it's not that ancient but still have historical value enrobing beautiful stories
Also les [Fables de la Fontaine] those are pure poetry and are pretty famous
I was thinking _Les Misérables_. It’s hard to pick just one book, though: I don’t think we truly have ONE that stands out for every French
Except if you consider the Marseillaise as a poem
It's probably because the [Chanson de Geste] was very influential on the italian epics that followed, such as Orlando Furioso or La Gerusalemme liberata
I would definitely count it too
Heck, this created a word (and the first meme
If you're out in the early hours of the morning, it's not uncommon to see deer roaming the streets, foxes too
We get quite a few squirrels
Recently, there have been sheep and goats up on the mountain pastures attacked by wolves
Rural France here
It often happens
Foxes , boars , deers , hares and rabbits, small rodents ,hedgehogs , storks , bunch of other smaller birds
I nearly got trampled on by some deer just yesterday but i also life in the country side
I saw a whole family of bunnies on Leipziger Straße once
They crazy
I feel really bad about it
Because we're busy working in December, while during the World Cup we're usually in holidays
Also because there's no reason to host it there, the Qatar national team is unknown and has nothing to do in the competition, they clearly paid a lot to host it
Makes me feel like puking
Many slave workers already died to build the stadiums
I find it revolting that they would hold it in such a country
I hope the fans who will travel to watch games there can live with themselves
I am conflicted on this one
On one side we can all agree this WC is spitting on every human right law that can exist
It smells like corruption 100km away and is overall just bad
However, Qatar is for me special in the way it is one of the only country of the middle east that is actively trying to open itself to the world
It is heavily investing in sport, culture, tourism
For a very secular muslim country, I feel like it does everything it can to broaden itself by other mean than religion
I prefer Qatar to be investing its petrodollar in Football than in financing some shaddy religious expansions
It'd be better if they could not use slave while building their stadium though
For the time slot, I watch a lot of rugby, and big tournaments are not in summer, it usually doesn't spoil the fun
Just like the World Cup in Russia
I'll bitch and whine about corruption and how Qatar has legal slavery
But once it starts, I'll be glued to my TV
This
The non-respect of human rights is the problem, here
The timing is a bother but not much more
Does it matter
Maybe the World Cup shouldn't have been held in Russia, maybe we should all have boycotted it
But that doesn't change the fact that we should definitely be boycotting the one in Qatar
South Africa was in France's group in 1998 and particpated in 2002 too
They are leagues above Qatar's team, where there is absolutely no interest in football whatsoever (stadiums are empty in all events)
I won't watch it cause I can't but if we play another final and have the occasion to get the third star I think I'll watch anyway
I'll most likely stream it with a VPN from a French or British channel
Northern climates put some hard constraints on what you can grow and when you can get it
In the South, if you got water, you have far more options and a longer growing season
I live pretty close to Dordogne, an area where you can grow *anything* 8 months in a year
Contrast that to Finland, for example
Historically speaking : greater diversity in agriculture, trade, much larger economies leading to greater sophistication among the upper classes
People tend to forget it, but until fairly recently large parts of Northern Europe were, let's say, quite boorish
> Different variations of meat/fish and potatos is so good, thats like all I eat
That's the issue
You are satisfied with little diversity
That's a very Scandinavian trait
I ate hutspot last night in Amsterdam and it was very good
Saint-Empire romain germanique (Holy Roman Germanic Empire), sometimes abreviated as simply Saint-Empire (Holy Empire) or even just Empire if the context is clear (ie at a time and place where it's the only relevant empire around)
Normally it's Saint Empire Romain de la Nation Germanique but usually you just see Saint Empire Romain Germanique ( SERG ) or even just Saint Empire Romain
Le saint empire romain germanique
(sacred roman-germanic empire)
Saint Empire Romain Germanique
So yes, holy roman german empire
Apologies for the stupid question, but which language is used when teaching history in Luxemburg
L'empire can also refer to the French first empire of Napoléon, and it coexisted with the HRE between 1804 and 1806
Right, so it wasn't _too_ stupid a question :D
That's fairly interesting
Do all subjects follow this split of German first, French later
The Académie Française is trying to do exactly that, not really working so far
In Québec yeah e.g. there's a low that forbids any brand to have an English name, so KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is PFK (Poulet Frit du Kentucky) in Québec, they use "ARRÊT" signs instead of "STOP" etc
But here not really unfortunately
I try to avoid them when it's possible to use a French counterpart but they are everywhere so it's pretty hard
The french academy is hell bent on finding a new french word for every loanword but that doesn't mean that anyone will use it
I have to disagree somehow
Decades ago, words were created when new concepts appeared, like ordinateur for computer or télécharger for download
I read some computer magazine from early 80's, and they said télécharger was a temporary new world for the concept of downloading (which was actually different back then, but that's another story), but it became the official word for it
It worked for most words of that time, maybe not for brands like walkman
In the late nineties, they started to propose new words years after a new concept or device became popular, and was already known by its English name
That was always a big failure, even more than the names were often ridiculous (éblabla for chat or cédérom)
A few things do exist like texto, but people only say SMS anyway, except maybe old people that don't use them
Even baladeur (word proposed for walkman long after its release) still exists, but the French term lecteur mp3 is much more popular (I don't know if I've ever heard anybody say baladeur)
Baladeur wasn't used for lecteurs MP3 but it was widely used for the CD walkman in the 90s/early 2000s. When I was a teenager we also used texto instead of SMS
Those two weren't big failures but successes for my generation (from what I get from your message you might be 20 years older than me)
> Even baladeur (word proposed for walkman long after its release) still exists, but the French term lecteur mp3 is much more popular
Baladeur didn't refer to lecteur mp3
Most things up to the 80's have a translation that more or less stuck (like "octet" for "byte")
Everything since 00's don't anymore, due to the internet making international notions adopted way too quickly for the AF to step in in time
In between, it's a bit more blurry (like "e-mail" and "courriel" which still co-exist, and was popularized in that timespan)
Because byte can be pronounced like bite in French which means dick
We all use octet but gigabyte or megabyte jokes never fail to make people laugh
I wonder what the impact would have been if French people use byte isn't of octet
Would there be constant dick jocks
Would every French (that don't speak English or is not in tech) have smiled everytime they heard of mega byte and giga byte
Yeah but they say melon d'eau
>it's just going to irritate people
Who
99% of the people in Québec speak French at different levels
Actually, "télécharger" is used for both upload and download which can get confusing
They invented a word for it, "Téléverser", but nobody uses that one
"Télécharger" is used both ways, as it just means "load remotely".
> upload
It's also télécharger
Ja (bocs, **igen**), tanulok magyarul és sok német szó találom miközben mindig gondoltam hogy 100%-os magyar volt (pl

Van is pár francia szó (sofőr, bizsu, butik, amatőr stb
Me too
It sounds pretty more logical to translate a brand name in your language to understand its purpose rather than letting it without translating it
Yeah why
I speak English fairly well, but I always have to stop a moment when I have to use lie/lay
Words a pretty similar and translations in French (in the "lie down" way) are also really close
And don't even get me started when I have to use it in past tense
I mixed up condemn and condone for a long time, before learning they were totally opposite
It comes in lexical fields to me :
is it hard or difficult or harsh or tough or rough or raw or crude well nope homie, it's solid
Yards and rooms and attics and halls
Corridors and fucking closets
Where do these words come from
Because in French a short story is *une nouvelle* and a novel is *un roman*
And in French :)
Same in Navajo
Interesting that the indefinite article is "a" and the plural is "k", it's exactly the same in Hungarian
Jeanne d' arc she was as crazy as she was badass,
even more badass when embodied by a child [
Yeah thats totally fake lol nothing to worry about dont worry
But don't check under her hats pls
It was a scandal for the far right some years ago want a black girl play Jeanne(Joan) during a festival in Rouan, they realy like ruining the fun
hmmm
I don't know but in my class, there are people who are offended everytimes that the teacher is speaking about another country because they think it is racist to say "For example, if we go china, we will don't understand anything".
A large part of the French population has at least some anti-vax beliefs
Same with homeopathy and psychoanalysis, and both can be prescribed by any doctor
There are even quite a few doctors who are anti-vaxxers (the best known being Henri Joyeux)
Former president Sarkozy is a climate change denier
Since European Union has been created as a response to World War 2 to prevent it from happening again it could be argued that anything related to EU is linked to WW2
France also demanded you acknowledge it in order to join the EU
> We ~~still~~ finally love you Germany
You better believe this rosbif, Germany
That's saying a lot !
Stalin even said: " Hitlers come and go, but Germany and the German people remain
>while the 2 nukes dropped on Japan by the USA are overlooked
You're right
I never understood that
Yes, I know, it's just to show WWI effect nowadays
Also my understanding is that the EU never really planned to let Turkey in because it would have too much power (population)) and be too expensive
The idea was more the closest partnership possible without having the Turkey in the European institutions
Isn't it the AKP government which abolished death penalty, allowed Kurds to speak their langage, go to parliament (I may be wrong) and got the openning of negociations ?
As for joining the EU, I am once again very sceptical
Several countries as Germany are very opposed to it
France and I think the Netherlands demanded to have a referendum if the decision is to be taken one day
It would not have been an easy one
The 2004 enlargement of the EU caused many troubles and we are now waiting to reform the institutions before integrating the Balkans so a 80m inhabitants country which borders Syria, Iraq and Iran
You're focusing on the condiment instead of the gas
Almost everytime
As a French, and I'm quite sure other european country does too, we have a lot of clichés that americans think they are real
Sometimes it's juste like "How can you even imagine that ?". At least that's the funny part
It's always sad to see that they mainly refer to others places as if it is the US and don't understand how it can be different
Read the news, open a book, open yourself to other cultures, you'll see that our world is wonderfully different
Even in Europe you can witness so many cultures
I might generalize too much, I admit, but how many time I talked with them and saw that they are really "american-centric" and don't know much about the rest of the world
Remind me a post I made about a Reunion kreol song in /r/listentothis
This is one of the comments
> *An american*: God, these whitie tourists who claim to understand  African culture are so cringy
> I have travelled a lot, these people are obviously social outcasts where they come from, and probably tried these locals out by taking 500 takes so they could pronounce the locals words right and look cool back home ‍
> *Me*: WTF ? They are both french
They both grew up and are locals of La reunion island, that's why the "whitie" speak fluently kreol
> You are the one making a racist assumption
Because she is white, she can't be a local ? Reverse the skin colors, you will understand what's the problem in your comment
> > I have travelled a lot, these people are obviously social outcasts where they come from, and probably tried these locals out by taking 500 takes so they could pronounce the locals words right and look cool back home ‍
> Not enought then
> *An American*: You say they are ‘french,’ I say they grew up in an African island nation colonised by the French empire
That’s like calling someone from Burkina Faso French
I just can’t help but think about the implications of the white crimes of the past
> *me*: Well, they have the same rights as the french people in France so they are french
> No, Burkina Faso is an independant country
La Reunion is a [french region] Just Like hawaii or Alaska in the USA
> You should really travel more
Geography is not your strong point
> *An american*:  Your last sentence is an attack, I still don’t believe that that land is ‘France
’ I was just in the British Virgin Islands, I really don’t want to call that England, and the locals are poor and not supported by England at all anyways
You’re super naive and angry and you should actually calm down and open your eyes to some horrible shit that’s happened in this world
So fucking dumb
just because Burkina Faso has been liberated but La Reunion has not, doesn’t mean they’re both remnants of forced colonialism
You are a sheep
> *me*' I was just in Hawaii, I really don’t want to call that USA, and the locals are poor and not supported by USA at all anyways
> So fucking dumb
just because Burkina Faso has been liberated but Hawaii has not, doesn’t mean they're not both remnants of forced colonialism
You are a sheep
> I guess I have to say to my reunionese friends they are not french then, because a dumb troll on internet said me so
> *An american*: Glad you’re still stressing over this, friend
The Hawaii comparison is poor at best compared to the example I provided
It seems you’re hell-bent on pushing your finger into your ears and shouting so I’m going to walk away, but I just want to say that you should open your heart and try to be more caring in the future, the world really needs it right now
Yeah, I would have given up this conversation before you did tbh
His/Her answer are very strange at the very best
Yeah he/she was upvoted, so I was a little bit angry haha
The world really need it right now
*My country whistling in the back*
We'd never do that here ! *No sir
*, we French don't like to give lesson on how you should live more like us
Anyway, I think most people are doing that, it's just that they (anglosphere) are overepresented here
I use more diverse insults
I can talk about sex in English and French with ease but weirdly when I speak Latvian, I’m just a big prude
Hell yeah
I am much more sociable and at ease with people in English
English is a very direct, free, simple language that allows you to express yourself in many different ways and nuances
French is heavy, complicated, awkward and boring
Fuck that's exactly what I was about to say
And this is why most of my humor on reddit is using memes
Exactement dude !
(Québec me manque, câlisse, là ! J'veux r'venir dans la Belle Province moi !)
Switzerland isn't a reliable example for this
Definitely not same here in France
Germany is notoriously cheap for grocieries tho
Lyon: cold people, great food
Paris: awful people, great place to visit as a tourist, city of love
Marseille: armed robberies, gangs shooting each others with leftover weapons from balkan wars
Bordeaux: bourgeois drinking wine and judging people
Montpellier : Oldest medecine university in France (and maybe Europe)
Berlin is supposed to be poor
Marseille is trying so hard to change its image, then shit happens like the girl getting stabbed to death in the metro station (actually the one that I take every day) and the building collapse
Turku's center is really pretty with well restored architecture
Also, Muumimaailma :D
Düsseldorf : better Carnival
It's mostly stereotypes
I have lived in Lyon for five years and did not find them cold at all, it's just what they are known for for some reason
Yeah, my sister studied there and she was happy, never had a bad thing happen to her but yeah Marseille still has a lot of problems that regularly stain their already poor reputation
Obnoxious football fans too
Hab den Kölner gefunden !
Yeah corsican people have a problem both with italian and french people
It's partly tied to them being islanders and partly tied to their history
It used to be a genoan colony but then they rebelled and kicked the genoans out, the corsican people then wrote a constitution and tried to do their own thing
The genoans did not have the military means to conquer it back but did not want to let it go without making a quick buck either so they sold the island to the french king, who had one of the most powerful armies in Europe at the time, for next to nothing
Then the french king sent tons of men and equipement and crushed the newly minted corsican government and anyone who opposed french occupation and said "okey, this is now part of France, like it or not we don't fucking care".
That being said corsican people can be charming as long as you respect their island and don't act like you own the place, I have been there tons of times and I have family there and I have only good memories of the place
This is one of the places where you can literally get slapped in the face for littering if a corsican person sees you do it as they take the protection of their island extremely literally and they give no fucks whatsoever
But generally if you are respectful they will treat you very nicely
I think that a lot will depends on the reaction of Politicians and people to climate change
Especially to climate refugees tbh
In 20-30 years we will have almost certainly tens of millions of people banging at our doors
From Africa, Middle-East, Asia
The migrant crisis of 2015 was nothing
The other impacts of Climate Change will affect us but not that badly to start with, we will probably be among the last part of the World to feel the bad of it, so, in the near future, the "worst" consequence of climate change for Europe will be the influx of refugees from the less well-off countries
The far-right, anti-european parties, will use it a lot to divide people and push for nationalist policies
It will be a great challenge for the EU
Our politics need to be more social
They need to reduce poverty much more than what they are doing right now because that will be a breeding ground for nationalism, and it can really destroy Europe
We need more equality and a better redistribution of wealth and a plan to welcome the future climate refugees
I think the EU will shrink and we will go back to a EU 12 of some sort
Many countries have shown that they were not interested in the European project nor by respecting basic European laws like an independent press or justice
The EU needs a compass before it goes anywhere,  and adding more countries would be a mistake imh
I'm sure the U.K. bet on the right horse
> EU is already pretty much a confederation
Say that to the eurosceptics hahahaha
What are you refering to when you say "not touching member states internal security" ? Not sure I follow .
Also the EU doesn't follow some of its rules, and that's for the best, like not imposing economic sanctions on countries not respecting the financial equilibrium (like France, for that matter)
Can we vote before imposing this s- on us  ?
It is certainly a good thing that the EU does not allow itself to impose sanctions on sovereign states
There are plenty of backstops, the EU doesn't have the means to pose a threat to any country regarding its internal security
France closed its border with Italy on that predicament, backing its claim with European law
As for the migrant quotas, the fact that they are not respected goes against your claim : the EU cannot impose those quotas on countries that refuse to
You claim that the EU is a dangerous entity imposing its ruling on people and countries when in fact more often than not they don't have the means for the policies they try to implement
And that is the main problem for me right here
There is no EU project if countries go against the EU project
The problem lies more with countries having different views than with a supposedly tyrranic EU
Also, it's always good to remind it, whenever a country chose to join the EU, they agreed to give up some of their regal powers
Not one country has been forced to do so against their will, and many asked for special treatments (Denmark, Ireland, UK)
Its written right there in the treaties that it can
But it wouldn't be politically good, that's why the EU often choses not to
And in some cases it's just technically impossible, like Poland and Hungary having each other's back when unanimity is required to put sanctions over a state
>The EU is currently suing the countries that refused them and might fine them
Would you care to share an example ?
Edit : If you are talking about Hungary and Poland, since 1993 there is something called the Copenhaguen principles, enforcing rules regarding civil rights, the liberty of the press, etc
The EU and the ECJ are trying to sue those countries (that joined long after 1993, so they knew what was expecting them) because they are stepping on those basic principles right now
>Correct me if I am wrong but didn't Franks speak Frankish until 9th century
Not really, no
Areas of Gaul that were properly colonized are now
speaking German and Dutch
But some thoroughly Roman cities like Trier, Aachen or Cologne were speaking Romance well into the 9th or 10th century
Northern France had considerable Frankish influence and it didn't take long until everyone was just called a Frank (and the people South of the Loire river being called Romans), but the language didn't change
There was a lot of Frankish vocabulary that made it into French, but a lot of it was lost from forced latinization (italization really) during the Renaissance
By the way Frankish has **nothing** to do with the phonology of modern French, as some idiot always seems to think so
>My question is how germanic speaking Franks become romance language speaking French
In Modern Northern France Frankish immigration was typically one family and their followers taking over the management of a village
There's just no demographic weight behind it
[A good map of disruption in Northern Gaul] (from Peter Heather's *Empire and Barbarians*)
Note that it's more a map of the social disruption of the 5th c. than it is of anything else
Parce que c'est la langue belle
It's interesting because considering you're a Turk, things happened differently in your country
Nomadic Turkic people invaded Anatolia, and in your culture's particular case, these latest invaders managed to impose their language, unlike the Franks in France
I'm no historian, but there are surely varying factors which explain the difference in cultural dominance
In the case of France, surely the prestige of the Roman Empire and Christianity, and the fact the conquerors were Germanic tribes begging to integrate the  Roman empire, and to emulate it, this favored the preexisting Latin-based culture
The Germanic tribes who eventually destroyed the Roman empire ironically wanted to be in the Roman Empire
I'm no specialist on Anatolian and Turkish history
I only know the Hittites existed and were pretty great, and Greeks/Byzantines were important as well in the region, but when the Turkic tribes arrived in the early middle ages, surely at that time and in that region, it was better to speak old Turkic
Perhaps religion was a factor
In Gaul/France, the Catholic Church and the memory of Rome were so important that Latin-based languages were privileged
Thus the invading Germanic nobility had to convert to Christianity, and learn the local language, and say they were the new Roman Empire (like Charlemagne
Latin hadn't taken *complete* hold of Gaul at the time of the Frankish coup
A lot of areas would have been speaking Gaulish, at least until fairly recently
The transition in some ways actually *improved* the status of Latin, as the status of senatorial families also improved and their skillset was essential
I know it's completely counter-intuitive
The Franks also allied themselves closely to Rome and relied heavily on the infrastructure and administration left behind by the Roman Empire, so Latin was use for much more than just for religion
> When Franks started speaking vulgar Latin instead of Frankish
Depends on the area
But by all accounts bilingualism in chiefly Romance areas (ie Northern France and Belgium) was the norm from the beginning
Places where sizable mono-linguistic settlements existed spread out in a ink spot pattern and form the modern Romance-Germanic border
It seems that there's been a "Germanic revival" of sorts as the Carolingians came on the throne and brought more ~~Austrians~~ Austrasians (ie a lot of Germanic speakers) around
Gauls was an umbrella term, they were a rather diverse bunch
>So people in Northern France considered themselves Franks while still speaking vulgar Latin with a lot of Frankish influances
Linguistics is a recent thing
People didn't really think of languages in quasi-mythical terms like we do
They just thought of it as "their language". So by the time most of the people who saw themselves as Franks spoke a Romance language, they just ended up calling it "the language of the Franks", ie French
You could say the same about Russian or Bulgarians, the Rus being Norse and the Bulgars Turkic
>Are there still some words in French that are of Frankish origin
*Fauteuil*, *écureuil*, *guerre*... I actually love *fauteuil*. In Old French it still looks quite Germanic (*faldestoed*)
It literally meant "folding chair", and by extension a throne
As the "folding chair" in question was a Roman *sella curulis*. See the [throne of Dagobert] Now it just means an armchair
Sorry, Austrasians, not Austrians
Though the etymology is the same
[Austrasia] was the Eastern portion of the Frankish kingdoms that contained both Romance and Germanic speakers
Not much, sadly
I know that the Gauls living in present Aquitaine were quite distinct
They spoke what would become the Basque language, itself being quite remarkable from being outside the Indo-European tree of languages
Likewise, there was cultural differences between the people in Aquitaine and the rest, noted by the Romans, and confirmed by archaeological research
The problem with the Gauls is that they didn't leave nice orderly records like the Romans did
a friend's grandmother is a pied noir, which means she's a daughter of french colons born in Algeria
Her family, like most pieds noirs, was sent packing from Algeria and she has a lot of resentment against Arabs, she considers them ingrates as she believes that the french occupation of Algeria was done with the purpose of helping local population ("we were just helping and they kicked us out" is a sentence I've heard a lot), she also believes the numerous reports about torture and war crimes were communist propaganda
I know old people who still sometimes call some countries in Africa "the colonies" but that's more of a "brain fart" I think: the vast majority don't care about losing our colonial empire
As far as I know, the only ones that lament the end of colonisation are far-right idiots & those who had to leave our former colonies (notably Algeria) when those gained independance
In younger generations: in 2017, during his campaign, future president Emmanuel Macron called colonisation a "crime against humanity". Polls made after this declaration showed that 66% of people under 35 agreed with this view, but only 26% on the right (and 31% on the far right)
Overall, 51% of the respondents agreed (and 52% thought that France should apologise for the crimes commited during the colonial era)
I think that the older generations, let's say the ones who were at least teens in the 60s during the decolonisation, are often pretty defensive when younger generations criticise the colonial past of France
I think that now we are seeing it as something really bad that we should be ashamed of while older people are more in the mindset "wasn't all that bad for the local populations"! I don't want to enter the debate of who's right or wrong on that, but I'll say that from my experience it's generally the attitude of young and old people when speaking about it
I mean, decolonization happened in the 60's when my parents were still kids
My grand parents were also quite young and we never talked about it
As far as I'm concerned, it's really a thing from the past
I am biased, as my family from my mother's side was pied-noir in Algeria and had to leave in the 60s, when my mom was a newborn
Some context to understand how **my** family sees the loss of the colonial empire, notably, Algeria as I think they are from the from the "forgotten settlers".
My great grandparents are from the south of Spain, and left their country due to lack of land
They came to Algeria to have a fresh start, they were poor, well not quite, but they weren't rich either
Both of my grandparents met there, at Sidi-Bel-Abbès, in western Algeria
My grandpa grew up in a small farm, not a big plantation that you usually depict from europeans settlers
Then my grandparents married, my grandpa enrolled the gendarmerie (an army corps that covers the countryside security in France) and then, fast forward, the war came
My grandma hasn't mang souvenirs of the war, she was in "safe place" up north, on the coast
My grandpa didn't talk at all about it
He fought against his brothers (not litterally of course), against what he saw as one people
And the local gendarmes were the ones doing the horrible jobs (by that I mean torture, interrogation, raids
) that were ordered by the french military
How do I know that ? We learn that in school
Anyways
In 1963, my whole family had to, once more, start all over again in a country isn't theirs, they never went the metropolitan France before, they were Algerians, well the old meaning of the word
Then, in France (if you care, my grandpa's brother went to live around Bordeaux, and my grandpa settled around Orléans [you get an affectation when you're gendarme]) my grandparents developped a form a racism, but pure stupid racism, a form of hateful trahison, the feel that they were forced to leave their land, their life, once more
As for my mother's opinion, I don't really know it she always told how my grandparents felt about the war and that whole hippity hoppity your farm is now Algeria's property, but I think she's quite neutral about it, she thinks that "it's a shame, but what can you do, it's done
So as for myself, I think it's a horrible loss for my family, but it was for the greater good of everyone
Colonisation is bad, even if you're not exploiting the natives, leave them bloody alone !
I put an emphasis on the many migrations my family endured to make y'all understand that France's relation with immigrantion is special in Europe
France was and, in a way, still is, and of immigration
So yeah sorry for the long the read and I hope the one guy that read it enjoyed it
Okay so there's a subtlety that needs to be addressed
If you talk about the French Empire, French people will automatically assume you speak about the Napoleonic one, not the colonial era
I'll assume you're speaking about the later and not the former
But I think that older generations and young generations both look down on this chapter of our history
The only difference is that for older generations it can be sometimes be out of racist motives: they view it as the triggering factor for all the African immigration we received the last 50 years
You probably can find here and there some die hard fans of the colonial era of France, but these are extremely rare to encounter nowadays
Although we don't necessarily have all the details, we all know that France should have mind its own business and not slaughter entire countries abroad
If you mean the colonial empire, I (and most other French ppl I know) couldn't care less, but if we talk about the French Empire, I really wish Napoleon didn't fail
Clearly we should've never left Europe (military wise - not exploration)
Except Rassemblement National nut jobs no one misses the colonies no matter how old you are
They don't really care for both i would say
We don't make any nationalist movememnt from that for obvious reasons
As a fellow french I also find it hilarious how the young descendants of pieds noirs seem to think they're somehow of Algerian descent
My grand father, who was born in Oran and left in the 1950s for Paris, says he left in part because he was ashamed of the treatment of arabs .
Mmmhh
I'm not sure about the older generation
I know it's anedoctal, but both my grand parents fought in the Algerian and Indochina wars
They think it was pointless and a waste if time, and disliked the colonial Empire
I don't think the people from 1968 was very fond of the Empire either
Speaking of which, the Algerian war was quite impopular among the french population
For what it's worth former British colonies have all done pretty well, to put it lightly
Bloc  Québécois don't even give a shit about France
I think it has to do with those people that had to leave our former colonies: they are classically right, but not far right, wing
They consider that calling colonisation a crime is akin to calling *them* criminals
They wouldn't go as far as saying that colonisation was good, but they would rather we never talked about it
Edit: the largest group by far, that had to left Algeria, is called the [Pieds Noirs] the Black Feet
If your first name include "ael" as in "Mael", "Gwennael" (with the exception of hebraic names such as Anael) or "gwen", and if your last name ends by "en", "ek". Most likely, you're from bretagne (or at least one of your parent is)
Bretons, Basques, Corsicans, etc have names in their regional languages
For example :
Fanch, Maëlle are Breton
Maïténa, Imanol are Basque
Tino, Vanina are Corsican
May I add first names ending in -ig/ick: Lenaig, Soazig, Pierrick, which means small
My extended family holds the following: Maël, Tanguy, Maïwenn, Tugdual, Aelia
Also if a name starts with Ker
Dead giveaway
If a name is Germanic sounding, probably from Alsace and Moselle
As an exception, because there are always exceptions in French, Michaël isn't a Breton name
It's just a common christian/hebrew name but in English to sound cooler than Michel
> Etxeberria
Interesting how it's francised here ^ ^
It'd be "Etcheberry"
Bavarian tinder’s most common men’s name that are very Bavarian:
Tassilo
Korbinian
Benedikt
Maximilian
Occasionally: Emmeram
Ça suffix
For the most part, yes
But then again German last names are not so uncommon in France, they are not necessarily Alsatian
Especially as the most common Alsatian last names are Meyer, Muller, Schmitt and Schneider, which are all also very common in Germany as a whole
But then again there are other names which are typically Alsatian and quite uncommon in Germany, such as Arbogast, Umbdenstock, Eschbach, Morgenthaler, Ott, Oberlin, Pfeiffer, Schlumberger, Pfister, Pfimlin, etc
etc
These are easily recognisable, they often end in -berger, -mann, -lin, -ster or -ler, etc
, and there is a big chance that people with one of these patronyms will have Alsatian ancestry
I don't know much about people from thé north east of France as i lived in thé north west/north Center most of my life
"Ker" is the "du"/"de" of the breizhonag names (ker rohan -> of Rohan/de Rohan)
> (with the exception of hebraic names such as Anael)
Any example of "n ending names" ?
From my perspective, I didn't noticed that immigrated names usualy end up with "n".
Didn't know that about my family name ! Thanks
I don't know if it was me who can't read after waking up or of it was just edited
But ultimately it doesn't matter
Tassilo is the name of a Bavarian medieval duke :)
Korbinian is the patron saint of Freising (medieval seat of the bishopric)
Emmeram is a Bavarian Saint :)
> Varkevisser
... Pigfisher
Ah ok
Sound like latin names after shaving the -us at the end
Florianus, etc
Well, statistically, if the immigrated community don't isolate itself, the names tends to disappear (as most of the girls from that community that marry a man not from the said community are likely to take their husband's name, so roughly every generation, 1/2 of the immigrant descendants takes a non-italian name)
I lived in Germany for 2 months for a linguistic exchange, it was fucking cool but I was glad to go back home
Moved to Switzerland recently, I'll eventually go back in France but not sure when or if I'll move to an other country
What's that one stupid sentence you know in a language you're not fluent in
For me it'd be jeg er en pølse in Norwegian

I don't know how it's so popular anywhere tbh
We do have a flower like the red poppy : we call it the bleuet de France
It was found at the same time as the red poppy
The association is now for soldiers, victims or pupilles de la nation( orphans of France)
In France, the flower to "honor all the soldiers" is a cornflower
But outside of officials during official ceremonies, almost no one wears one
Not a thing in France although we do have the Bleuet de France, a blue cornflower
It’s not like the poppy though because hardly anybody wears one and you’re unlikely to see one outside of official ceremonies or military establishments
In the UK, obviously we have the poppy and I do sometimes wear one but I’m one of those obnoxious cunts who only wears it alongside a white “peace poppy” which symbolises *all* of the victims of war
The red poppy has become something different
It’s glorifies war and is growing more and more into a symbol of nationalism and militaristic pride
When I was young there were many WWI veterans who would give talks and share their experiences and they were truly hellish
I thought the poppy was a way of remembering all of those young men and boys whose country sent them to die in agony on some foreign bit of land
I thought it was a reminder of why there are no winners in war
Unfortunately we’ve learned nothing and the poppy has become a military symbol that we whip out once a year to glorify an ever-increasing number of deaths, but only British deaths, in wars that half of the time we shouldn’t have even been involved in
We do have the "bleuet", the cornflower, with the typical French blue colour, that is starting to get traction these last years amongst official representatives but definitively not in the general population
Every single village have a WWI/WWII memorial and still have 11 November ceremonies but it is falling out of fashion quickly
Almost nobody besides the mayor and some people in the veterans associations (which are getting fewer and fewer) still attend those, while the 8th of May and the 11th of November remain off work days
Maybe it should be transformed about general peace or something more than about dead soldiers rememberance, because as generations pass a vast majority of people are disconnected from that notion nowadays
Especially when you consider that a good chunk of the population originates from people arriving in France after WWII (Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, Africans, south-east Asians
), so without direct connexion to those memorials (former colonies excluded of course, whose soldiers were the first in line and are often without recognition)
We wear them at school just because there’s and internationals english section

I feel like Czech Republic has a more badass effect than Czechia
Just my opinion though
I always prefer the shorter version to the longer one
And it sounds better in my opinion
It's Tchéquie in French (République Tchèque), I'm not sure if I find it atrocious or not
Same goes for France, "Tchéquie" is more widely used than "République Tchèque"
I think it's because in our language, the standard is still "République Tchèque", and the word "Tchéquie" is still seen as a bit weird
Based on the other answers, it seems that a lot of countries were already using the short name in their respective languages
**Edit** : I just noticed that the first "*e*" is not accentuated the same way in both forms
Most likely yeah
I didn't realised it was renamed "Tchéquie" until last year and the name changed occured in 2016 I think
I feel like Tchéquie sounds more of a city name more than a country name
No idea why I feel this way though, Italie sounds fine as a country name
But anyway I don't think Czech people care about what we think about their name change haha
...maybe ;)

Jalousie et envie, different words, different meanings
We have jalousie and envie, pretty similar to English
I heard it defined thus once: envie is, I want to have what you have (envie means a want)
Jalousie is, i want you not to have what you have, so it’s a bit more malicious
Jalousie/envie
The English took it from us so they're similar
I agree with you
Unfortunately so many people are not using words for what they mean
If jealous of something or someone it’s just dark thoughts towards it
If envious of something or someone, you can do something about it
Sometimes it can even be admiration
Yes and no
There are around 20 regional languages in metropolitan France (60-70 in our overseas territories), from a lot of language families: gallo-roman, germanic, occitan, celtic
I made [a comment with more details] a while back
The issue is that France strongly (and successfully) repressed those language in the second half of the 19th century
At that time, French was the native language of only half the population of France
Nowadays, 6-7% tops of the population knows a regional language, and almost no one has one as their native language
Think about Switzerland: 4 main languages, and a ridiculous number of accents and dialects
Now think about how big Switzerland is, especially compared to Russia
People might disagree but to me french is totally uniform in metropolitan France
I don't believe we have regional accents but for sure people in some regions use some words or remnants of dialects time to time that others regions don't.
French Canadian ( Québécois ) is french with a thicc accent and use of differents words for some things
I don't really see it as a dialect tho, more as a sister-language kind of
Just to point out that there _are_ dialects in Russia (I only know of those of the indigenous peoples, so that’s what I’m talking about)
I believe they’ve been rather heavily repressed when the USSR was a thing, but I’d need to check my notes on that
I’m curious about the way those are counted
There are lots of dialects in Britany, but they share the generic name of Breton: are they counted as one language, or as several languages
Woups, I answered to the wrong comment
They’re languages, my bad
Pfizer
BionTech was in the news plenty when the vaccine was announced and it's pretty well-known that the lab was a German one, but we do call it the Pfizer vaccine
Similar to how Hyperloop One became Virgin Hyperloop, the money often dictates the name
We either call it Pfizer BioNTech, or more frequently only Pfizer
Usually Pfizer/BioNtech in decent medias but people just shorten it Pfizer
Probably because it's the first part of the name and it's a famous already known company, unlike BioNtech
I also assume people would trust more a big famous name than a small company they never heard about
I don't think we care much if it is american or german
If it were Sanofi we would care a lot probably though
Both party were required to have this vaccine but I mostly attribute the science breakthrough to Biontech
The big difference is that Janssen belongs to J&J.  BioNtech is independent from Pfizer

We have a party which used to be called "Chasse Pêche Nature et Traditions" (hunting - fishing - nature -traditions), now called "Le Mouvement de la Ruralité" (Rurality's Movement)
Beyond being yet another beacon for conservatism, traditionalism, euroscepticism "and stuff", it's mostly known in France as a relay for (your casual) hunter or fisher lobbying
Saying they're not at the gates of power is an understatement, if you mind
Le parti de la loi naturelle was a political party in France
Hopefully they don't exist anymore
Look at this videos it's hilarious
[Vol yogique et lévitation transcendantale]
[Parti de la loi naturelle]
Yeah please, even I don't know what it is
They promote french traditions such as hunting and fishing
They support the french republicans when they fail but it's a countryside party they want to protect their traditionnal hobbies
They don't do great scores but they exist lol
I think they also want to improve the quality of life in rural areas by improving agriculture and stuff
It's a rural activities promoting party lol
Ah yes Jean Lassalle and his legendary "beauf" moments
Don't worry nobody voted for them
You wouldn't consider India, Argentina or Kazakhstan to be big
Everything looks small compared to Russia, to be fair
In france, in tgv there is a quiet zone in first class, you need to book it  and it's the same price than the first class ticket
There is a business zone in first class too wich is quiet
But generally first class is quiet because it's made of small zones instead of a full wagon with dozen of people
We also have specials place to use your phone so you won't disturb other people, with a desk if you need it
In some tgv a "family place" can be book: your kids can make noise there
We have the opposite
You're supposed to be quiet all over the train, making your calls in the space between the cars
It's also generally considered bad etiquette to be loud/chat on the phone even in second class
It's not necessarily a rule but you might be asked to shut up or get death glares
That's mainly for TGV though, it's less the case with local trains
Yes, especially because for both first and second class you can find small spaces and the end of every wagon (near the doors of suitcase space) for phonecalls
My favorite city in France is St Malo, just next to the sea with a beautiful architecture and a rich history
Also I am nostalgic
Well, maybe not favourite but underrated,  I would say Strasbourg, France
Although it’s quite popular with foreign tourists (including Asian, American, etc
), French do not seem to have discovered the Alsace region for themselves yet
Nancy is a super cool city and has a really nice architecture
None, cities suck
Give me small villages and the countryside
That's what I was going to answer
I always get mocking looks when I say that, but apparently I'm not the only one to think that
I visited it some years ago
Beautiful beach and great food (crêpes bretonnes !!)
Also home to the greatest Italian football team of all time, so that doesn't hurt

Oh god I miss that so much :')
Hahahaha, good point
I figured that if anyone wanted to know which one I'm referring to, they'd just have to check my Reddit history
Je suis française (pas alsacienne) et je vois pas de quoi tu parles non plus :')
The French meme game on Twitter is really strong, the most popular meme when I quit it was [this one] And we have plenty of specific French memes which I like better than English one because they're generally more relatable
On Facebook, we have things called "neurchis" where there are plenty of OCs about different themes and they're generally pretty good quality
However if you're not well versed with the theme of the "neurchi", you're gonna be lost really quickly
On Reddit I'll [let] [you] [judge]
English memes are better , french memes are specific of us , and the concept of a popular meme format don't exist
r/rance
LE PAIN AUX RANÇAIS FDP
On non reddit we have this
Pretty strong meme game
this sardoche one makes me laugh
every
time
Neurchi de Tintin is probably my favorite, it gathers tons of Tintin memes
We also have David Goodenough, who apparently is known outside of France for some reason
There's not really much else on Reddit apart from maybe /r/franse but it will not help you learning French
Go on Facebook and search "Neurchi de". It's where the gold is
Personal faves: Neurchi de Tintin, Neurchi de memes historiques, Neurchi de Memes décentralisés pour provinciaux et francophones oubliés, Neurchi de memes extra-muros, Neurchi de commentaires, Neurchi d'escalade soudaine, NEURCHI DE DINOS
The problem with r/franse is that French language here is deliberately wrong in all the worst ways possible
Not a good idea to use this as a learning tool
You'll probably be better reading French/Belgian comic books
Also watch some French cartoons (try Last Man, it's very good)
There are also French movies, but most of them are garbage, or at least for a very niche audience
How do you use such filters
I grew up in the Somme so we went to visit one of the sites of the WW1 Battle of the Somme, specifically the memorial for a Newfoundland regiment that fought there
It was incredibly interesting because they keep an entire trench network (shell craters included) just as it was during the war and you can walk in them freely
What shocked me was how close the German and Newfoundland trenches were to each other, it varied a lot but at some places there were no more than 20 meters or so between them
To add to the realism it was raining hard that day, it really made you realize how miserable it must have been for the soldiers living and fighting in them everyday, I was actually burning with fever the next day
[Here is a picture of the place for reference]
Verdun
We even got to meet and briefly talk to a WW1 veteran (yes, this was in 1994)
Having travelled around a bit, I can say I am proud that we're using this sad past to solidify peace and friendship between nations
Not a single day because of travel but single day of visit: Vulcania, it's in Auvergne where there a tons of sleeping volcanoes and it's like part science and part attraction park
Guedelon Castle in Burgundy
They are building it the same way as it would have been done during the Middle Age
Learned to start a fire there
Came back ten years later and was stunned at how well it had progressed
I can't find the name of the museum but it was about coal
They took us down in a coal mine for a visit and at the end revealed it was a false one
The lift we took was not real
It was really fun and interesting
I went to a really cool science museum in Switzerland, it was super fun and great
The full french experience

We had some course in middle school as part of biology
I went to a christian school and never had sex ed
The internet did his thing I guess
Sex Ed at school, but I’ve always been able to talk about it at home
My mom is a nurse, so she began explaining some stuff when I got my period, she even made a doodle so i could properly understand
When we were seeing some things on TV like teens pregnancy or STD she would ask me if I knew how to protect myself
When I (22f) got a boyfriend (my fiancé now) at 17 I ask her to call the doctor to have the pill, she bought me condoms and asked my boyfriend (he was also virgin) to make blood tests to make sure he was clean
I’m really happy that I’ve always could speak with my mom about it
My dad doesn’t talk about it with me, but he has brought me condoms without problems
It's actually true
parle en français je comprends pas la
It's not really about my country but I heard an interesting trivia about Poland
During the Napoléon Era the polish were quite supportive of him and were great soldiers under him
Haiti was a colony of France and wanted the end of slavery and their independence
Napoleon sent troops and among them a polish legion, but they felt the similitude of haitans's situation and theirs (Poland was between Prussia and Russia and was for a long time occupied)
So they revolted against Napoléon and helped Haiti gaining their independence
They are even called black in the first haitan constitution and the first head of states called them "the white n**oes of Europe".
France and the Netherlands share a border [in the Caribbean]
This is one of the reasons why the Schengen area is a good idea
Imagine the nightmare of border patrol there
There was even a Toyota War
I'm glad to see that it's taught in school, in my eyes it's really impressive that polish had the empathy and the courage to sacrifice their well-being, potentially the independence of their country for their idea
French-German here
I struggled a lot with my national identity growing up, not knowing which I was supposed to be, but my (French) dad cleared it all up with this one sentence I’ll never forget: “You’re not half German nor half French, you’re 100% German and 100% French, and you should live your life like this” that kind of cleared stuff up
Today I don’t really care about how people perceive me, because I feel a stronger tie to the EU as a whole, because that’s the one thing I’m absolutely sure I am 100%. If I HAD to answer the question Id say I do feel more culturally French, because I was raised here most of my life
My mother was born in Spain, my father in France
I was born and raised in France
Half of my family is Spanish and I saw them regularly when I was a kid
I feel close to them and their culture, but I never considered myself Spanish
I don't know the language (my mom tried to teach me but I wasn't very receptive), I didn't experience living there and the surrounding culture is different
It's part of my history and legacy, but it has barely any significance in my identity
I'm pro Europe, so it's nice to have this multi national history but to be frank, almost everyone in Europe has some kind of connection to another country if you go back a few generations
I’m half French and half British
When I’m in France, I feel too British/English
When I’m in England, I feel too French
I feel like an outsider wherever I go
I speak both languages but you can tell from my accent that I’m not “properly” French
I started schooling in France when I was very young but moved to the UK after a couple of years
I didn’t speak much English when I arrived but now I speak better English than French
I’ve spent the odd year back in France as a teenager but I went to university and started my career in the UK
I try to split my time now and it was great when I was working remotely so I could live anywhere but now I spend about 4 months in France every year and the rest in the UK
Honestly, I hate it
Especially since Brexit, I can feel a lot more hostility towards me being British despite the fact that *I didn’t vote for it, the vast majority of people in my region didn’t vote for it, and I literally don’t know a single person who did
I feel kind of like a fraud to say I’m French or English
Atop of that, I’m Jewish, I’m from quite close-knit communities (which I deeply adore) and so we’re treated a lot like outsiders regardless of how long our communities have been here
We’re still seen as kind of
suspiciously foreign
I doubt it’s a good thing for the community but I’m actually really glad for that though because it means I can be surrounded by other people who are seen as “not quite French/English enough” despite being there their entire lives
It’s definitely true that there are bonuses of sitting on a fence between cultures
I get the best of both worlds and I am deeply attached to both
It’s just a shame that sometimes it feels like I’m not a legitimate part of either
I have an Italian father and a French mother, born and raised in France
I clearly identify more with my French side as I wasn’t raised with the italian langage and culture around me, and even though I’m still interested in Italian culture, history
I would never claim to be french-italian, something like that
Do you speak Scots and/or Irish, or just English
Oh, thoses vikings want to be our vassals and protect us against other vikings in exchange for a small duchy in the north ? Cool
*1000 years later*
And that's how we later created England and a rivalry that started countless wars and deaths
"Surely it would be a good idea to help the United States win their independence war and be freed from Britain, no way this idea can turn against me" Louis XVI, probably
[Saar offensive in 1939] France could have end the war early but thought it was a Germany's setup
Althought germans were just busy invading Poland and western front was genuinely wide open
"Surely this random guy won't recognize me and my wife" Also Louis the XVI
Wasn't Russia's shitty performance in the Winter War due to Stalin murdering all the competent military leaders ?
Did Czechoslovakia really have a choice in the matter ?
It makes me think of a question I have for british people : in english class, when I was around 11yo, we were taught that, on the phone, british people don't answer by saying hello but by reciting their phone number
My bf had the same lesson
I've always wondered if it was true
Can someone help ?
I had a teacher telling us that we should use and abuse tag question, also strongly emphasize them with an intonation
She was adamant that all English people talk that way
I later realized that this cunt probably wanted to makes us sound like a bunch of posh British aristocrats and she was having a lot fun with this, isn't she
I was told by my german teacher that german speakers answer the phone by saying their full name instead of just "Hello" which is more practical than "Hello" "Is this Bob
" "It's Farenknight" "Who ?" "IT
FARENKNIGHT
" "Far a kite ?"
Is this true ?
I was taught by every single English teacher that a notebook was a *copybook*. I live in London and no one in the UK have ever heard this word
The noun "a kiss" is indeed *un baiser*, but yeah, we use *embrasser* for the verb
However, there might be regional variations: for exemple, Belgians use the verb *exciter* to express enthusiasm, but in France it is almost only used in a sexual context (*ça m'excite*, would mean "I'm excited about that" in Belgium, and "That makes me horny" in France)
(that's what I learned in Belgium a decade ago, if someone from Belgium could confirm/infirm)
Your teacher must have been pretty old, since the shift in meaning is due to Marquis de Sade who died in 1814
I don't even know what a 'tag question' is supposed to be
I use them naturally because when I don't know a word in English I just anglicise the French one and that's probably why people thought I looked weird
Of course we use tu, we ain't gonna vouvoyer our family/friends/SO etc
Vous is for a stranger, someone higher in the hierarchy (and even then depending on your job it's not always the case), a teacher, someone you've already seen but don't feel too close to (depends on a lot of things actually like age etc) and obviously to a group of people
More like "J'sais pas" or "Chais pas", or even "Ch'pas"
"J'ai pas" means "I don't have". What you should say in your context is "Je sais pas" or short J'sais pas".
"J'ai pas" means "I don't have"
We'd say "je sais pas" (pronounced chépa, written jsp when texting)
On the opposite, if you drop the "pas" and not the "ne" (e.g. "je ne sais"), it's considered highly archaic and so formal a president wouldn't even use it
I think it comes from the guy who invented this (László Bíró, whose name means judge in Hungarian) but it definitely isn't used in any country
It's the other way around, inversion looks cringe, we use the first one all the time
You're mistaken
"Intonation" and "Est-ce que" are the most wildly used, Inversion is very formal and never used with tu
I'm really curious, on top of what the other commenter said, don't other languages have the intonation thing for questions
I use it even in english
AH ! I knew it ! Thank you for answering !
Oh, it's just "hello"... Each time I have to answer phone from an English-speaking person, I always go with the French "Allo", then remember that I'm fucking stupid because I'm not talking to a Frenchmen, then I panic, and THEN I manage to say something normal, like hi or hello
It must be confusing as hell for the other person
Well, answering phone is already difficult in my own language so in doing it in English can be difficult
Ahahah I never thought about it, but indeed it sounds like this for me as well !
In France, we say "Allo"
Ah good to know ! thank you !
>I also remember learning this, although only the older English teachers thaught this
My teacher was pretty young, around 25yo I'd say
And she was quite firm about this
When we would practice our english by answering a (fake) phone call, WHAT A BLASPHEMY IS WE SAID HELLO BEFORE THE PHONE NUMBER !
Thank you for answering ! It's really interesting, it actually makes sense
In France, if i remember well, you had to put money before calling, so maybe that's why we didn't have such thing
No I never said that using it is what make it sound posh, it's more abusing it and strongly emphasizing it
Throwing a 'innit
at the end of your sentence very naturally to get your point across is obviously fine
Saying it for no apparent reason with a a lot of exaggeration is something else, we definitely sounded like we were cosplaying an 19th century tea party
*The weather is lovely today, isn't it
*Yes, we were thinking about hiking earlier, didn't we
*I've lost my dog today, didn't I?*
Mi nem is tanulunk semmit a mi olimpiai játékainkról
I think I haven't said "ne" ever
Oh you absolutely spelt it wrong xD j'ai pas means "I don't have (it)". J'sais pas on the other hand does mean "I don't know"
Louis XIV is that you
So it's really something old people used to do
Thank you for your answer
Ah I didn't know it was a thing in other countries ! Thank you for telling me !
Got it, so I can throw a very exaggerated tag question at the end of every sentence and definitely sound natural
>Enunciating anything in an exaggerated way can sound pretentious
I do agree that this was probably a bigger part of the problem rather than the tag questions themselves, the way she wanted us to pronounce them and using them in very short succession was what sounded weird
My examples are not out of the ordinary when taken individually, but those were all in a row
If you tell me that it's completely normal to have a conversation with 20 over the top tag questions in a row I would suspect that you're conspiring with my teacher
I don't really like the French names for a lot of cities
I mean, I like the famous ones like Paris, Lyon, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux (and Rouen, Reims, Nantes and Caen, only because it's funny to hear foreigners pronounce them badly)
However, a lot of cities and town have "sur" and "lès" in them, like all these towns: maizières-lès-metz, Montigny-lès-Metz, Moulins-lès-Metz, Longeville-lès-Metz, etc
It gets very confusing which one's which
Maybe it's because we have a fuckton of commune, So it's hard to find original name
for comparison :
France : 35 000 communes
Germany : 11 000
Spain and Italy : 8 000
Belgium : 600
I agree, lots of places have super long names like "Saint-Aubin-les-vallées," "Mossigny-sur-Seine" which can be very annoying when trying to travel in the countryside ("What do you mean ALL the villages have 'sur-Marne' in their name
At least you can help locate yourself thanks to the geographic peculiarity included in the name lol
I don't find it ugly and quite like it, but everyone has different taste
But it's definitely super annoying
I'm from Bretagne and I'm currently living in Alsace and I can't relate to what you are saying, it seems like a myth I see only on Google maps (but I can't help but think "wow
Really
" when I see the names of cities in Ile de France for example)
I don't know about basque or corse cities but the name of cities in Bretagne and Alsace are really typical from these areas
I know that in Bretagne some of the names have been made more French (Morlaix is Montroulez in breton) and let's not talk about how every small town begins with Plou- (Plougourvest, Plouezoch, Plougonvelin, Plouvorn
In Alsace, as far as I know, the traditional alsacian names for cities have been replaced by more germanish interpretation of these names
Most of French people are making fun of the name of cities in Alsace (Schiltigheim, Illkirch Graffenstaden, Souffelweyersheim, Pfaffenhoffen
) because they seem really absurd
But I like them, I like how the name of cities in France are different from a region to another, it's really cool and varied
We do have a city that’s called Condom, and that is priceless
To anyone wondering: Condom is the French name, and it’s not pronounced the same way the English “condom” is
Still funny to me, but my humor is pretty lame
Because your u with dots is pronounced exactly the same as our u, so it's not that hard to get right
However it's always kinda hard to pronounce your "i" without the dot
(Great people and food btw
As a French, I prefer to say Valencia, because it sounds much cooler but mostly because we also have a Valence in France and it can be quite confusing
I hope I will be able to come back to Valencia for the 2021 Fallas !
North Finistère, right ?
But honestly names of cities in brittany are just so cool, and not just the "plou" one
We have quite a lot of individual villages, much more than 35 000
Also, I’m about sure there is a political question here (if you regroup communes, you fire staff)
Really
Is there a specific reason to this
And I do enjoy the fact
This made my day (night
I’ll have to look these shops up to see if they still exist
Also, let’s be clear: I do not have a condom obsession
But I’ll be going through a German year in a week, as part of a two-week exam, and I don’t know shit about German
But now I know how to say condom
THIS is what I truly find hilarious (in a desperate kind of way, ngl)
A common nickname for Marseille in French is "the Phocean city"
I highly doubt that this comes up in my exam anyway, but thanks for the head up and I’m always happy to learn, so: nice :)
Creuse, Ardèche, Lozère, Cantal
Very rural, hardly any city worth mentioning
Fantastic places to go if you like quiet holidays
Littéralement la “diagonale du vide” au centre de la France
I know it's (probably) not the etymology of the word, but it's worth noting that *Creuse* literally means "hollow". Talk about being self-descriptive
The middle of the triangle of Toulouse, Clermont, and Montpellier is quite empty in terms of population density
Le Puy is pretty much the only city
There is a lot of farmland and middle mountains
It’s called “les landes”. It is quite desolate but on a smaller scale than what I previously mentioned
Elle porte bien son nom
True
To this day, one of my best summer was spent in Cantal
I love Les Landes and spent many summers there but it is true that the coast is basically the main attraction, not much else to do
It has been back and forth over the span of the last centuries
Peasants moved to plant jobs in the cities in the second half of 19th century
Then 1st half of 20th, people in the cities felt the scarcity of food during wartime (and after), they were more likely to be bombarded too, and as the railway improved, some plants moved to smaller cities and plantworkers with them
2nd half of 20th, huge move towards the cities for white collar jobs and now in the 21st century there's a new trend of going back to village life, raising chickens and veggies while working remotely
It started before the pandemic but it was only a thing among high-earning white collars who believe they had bullshit jobs, but with the pandemic the trend has spreaded greatly
Kinda the other way around, more and more people from big cities go to the countryside to live more quietly
That's pretty much how it works
And the young very educated elite go to the US/UK
Young move to cities for uni and work
Families move from cities to suburbs for extra bedrooms at lower price
Retired move from suburbs to (sunny) countryside for quieter life
That's usually the pattern in the West
It's a hexagon lol
"la diagonale du vide" (empty stripe) is more accurate than empty center
The low population density in those areas is even more striking when you go to Germany or the UK
In corsica every road sign is riddled with bullets holes
That makes every sign scary when you don't know it's just a corsican thing
They shoot it for fun or target practise
Naturist beach signs
Nothing is more terrifying than a landscape filled with old naked german and dutch couples
I'm still having nightmares at night
We call these beaches: "Teutonic BBQ"
Most scary was in Scotland at the entry of fields
It was something along the lines of « dogs who scare cattle can be shot »
The ones about buried explosives from the world wars in the forests near the German border
You don't want to step on a mine do you
> Warning: falling cows
That's a cool sign, but what are you supposed to do
I'm pretty sure those things fall down fast and hard
It’s mainly a way to show French government what they think of it
Corsica wouldn't be Corsica without the bullet holes
Isn't it pretty standard everywhere ?
Alvin and The Deadly Chipmunks
Oh hey, me too
I was 5 years old and a complete stranger put his leather jacket over my head so I would be protected from any flying glass
Thanks, kind Mancunian fella
yeah also
Corsica is our Texas, many of them have guns, legally or not
A corsican friend of mine who is also a hunter told me that as kids they would do it for no reason, it's just a sport now
I think you never hear gunshots in Corsica too, you just have evidences it happened
In the whole country you hear gunshots during the hunting season though
Yeah we definitely have those in France
Could be just a UK and France thing though
I would absolutely try and hand feed a squirrel ngl
Really helpful, thanks
It's the most popular sport in the South West, even ahead of football
Everywhere else, it's relatively popular (more so in big cities like Lyon and Paris which have good clubs), but nowhere near football
It's quite popular in France , but not as popular than [Football] (or soccer for USA)
Saying that football is almost non existent is a bit far-fetched
You'll sure find cities where rugby is more important but football is still strong
Toulouse does not have the best football team but they're still a regular of Ligue 1 or a strong Ligue 2 team, a lot of cities where football is more prominent can't say the same
Yes
I'm not really keeping up on rugby news but I know that Toulouse and Toulon do great almost each year
It's quite popular, I think like the 5th or 6th sport with the most members
Hey, Portugal made it to the 2007 World Cup
Pau, Montauban, Albi, Brive, Agen and so on, you can't say these are some strong football places
Hell even here in the Alps rugby and handball (especially because of the club of Chambéry) are somewhat more popular than football
Of course football is a strong sport there, sure Rugby is very popular in those places, sometimes more, and there's a good share of the local population playing it
But from that to say that it's almost non existant it's very far fetched
I can talk about Pau if you want (since I'm from there and played my fair share of sports in the region)
Rugby is popular, the Section Paloise is well-known and liked, attract players from everywhere and stimulate neighboring town to have their own Rugby clubs, etc
But still you'll find more people playing football in Pau than rugby, because globally in France football is the go to sport
I don't, I only refrigerate the milk when it's open, it's not fresh milk like is some countries, so we can keep it weeks out of the fridge
Virtually unheard of in France a few years ago
But in the last 5 years or so, it is becoming totally acceptable
I have done it several times (especially with my kids)
It has never been a problem
It depends
Doesn't happen in gastronomy restaurants (it's not like the quantities are too big), it wouldn't be elegant
Same in all you can eat buffets, because you can't take food home
In other restaurants it's common to have doggy bags
Isn’t there a law about it now
I vaguely remember something like that from a few years ago, stating restaurants have to give you leftovers if you ask for them
Yeah, especially in Pizzerias: my girlfriend has a really small appetite so instead of leaving half of her pizza uneaten she asks to box it, and eats it the next day or at work
It really depends on the restaurant, though
In lots of places you’d be looked at you real funny (and then the people running the restaurant would probably accept that you take things with you, but still be uneasy & think that you’re super rude)
Honestly, I’d have gone we a “no, not a thing at all”.
The few times I’ve asked for my leftovers to be wrapped, waiters and chefs were more than happy to comply
They felt it was less waste and a true compliment to their cooking
I believe so yeah, restaurants have to accept if you ask
Yes, in France it is now required by law that restaurants offer you to package your leftovers for takeaway
The difference might be that they has been lots of talks in France in the past few years about food waste
Supermarkets are forced by law to reduce waste etc
This has had an impact on restaurant
It's a pretty positive move
It's not common as portion sizes arent that big in France (quality over quantity)
But it happens
Restaurants have to accept and they generally are happy to oblige
It mostly means "I'm full but I really liked the food and want to bring leftovers for later".
Except in All you can eat restaurants
Obviously
Culture
As far as I can see, serving sizes have not changed
We use AZERTY
[French azerty]
We have keys with é, è, à, ù, ç  and a \^ and ¨  key for ê, â, î, ä, ï, ë etc
The number row is Inverted
To type numbers, you have to press shift key
It's just a matter of what you're used to
I'm used to AZERTY and I'm completly lost on Qwerty, but if I would use it everyday I would quickly get used to it too
I think French is the only language to use AZERTY, and it has many additional letters (à, ç, é, è, ù and `, ¨, ~ and ^ so if we combine them with vowels we can also type â, ä, ã, ê, ë, î, ï, ì, ñ, ô, ö, õ, ò, û, ü and ÿ that we can only type as a lowercase letter)
Sadly œ is missing, even though it exists in only 4 words (sœur, cœur, bœuf, œuf), these are pretty common so it's such a shame
A key for acute accent would be really appreciated too
AZERTY, with a keymap that allow me to do characters like «»ÉÀœŒÇ more easily
The default French Windows layout is a shame
[fr-oss on Windows] for those interested, it's default on Linux
In France the bépo keyboard was created because it's more ergonomic regarding the french language but it's not too popular
Mon conseil : utiliser la disposition [« fr-oss »] qui est pratiquement identique à l'AZERTY de Windows et qui permet de faire plus facilement les majuscules accentuées entre autre
[À récupérér ici sur Windows
AZERTY is evil, I use bépo
It is recognized as an official norm in France, but it's not common
The ¨ letters are still pretty easy to do though, assuming your AZERTY is similar to ours
[« fr-oss » is the way to go
Being able to have accented capitals easily does sound pretty great

" shows pride in being part of the former empire
*Romania* derives from the [Latin] *romanus*, meaning "[citizen of Rome]
&#x200B;
Italy, being the birthplace of the Empire, has the greatest number of buildings and ruins, and takes care of this legacy with the utmost dedication
Not really Roman pride but we commonly to our cultural heritage as « gallo-roman » which is the marriage of Gallic and Roman cultures
Since 1870, the French Republic has been pushing the Gauls as our spiritual ancestors
And before that, it was the Franks
True, it didn't last long though
Funny thing about the Holy Roman Empire, it was neither Roman nor Holy
That's a bit extreme - we are taught that we are a Latin culture, and that our ancestors the Gauls were romanised to become "Gallo-Romans", embracing Roman customs
Except that, under Napoleon, a Roman aesthetic was very visible and the analogy was much more complex (and complete) than just aesthetics, even though Napoléon tried to suppress it when he became Emperor
[La Nation française et l’Antiquité à l’époque napoléonienne ]
>muddy heritage
How so
We tend to view the people who got conquered by Romans as savages (they weren't), because most accounts we have of them come from biased Roman testimonies
The gauls had Runic language but only the Druids knew how to read and write
Despite no other accounts about them than Roman testimonies, we have a few ruins (dolmen), potery, jewelry and many weapons (they used to be mercenaries for the Roman Empire before being conquered)
These people were very fine craftsmen, you can tell by looking at their work in museums
While their civilization wasn't as advanced as the Romans, they had a culture, traditions, their own mythology
It's such a shame we don't know more about them
Same with the Dacians and all the other cultures wiped out by the Romans
Yeah we don't care about that here either
The french legislation consider that a worker on a "contrat à durée indéterminée" (permanent contract) can work without any paper contract (with just a "tacite" contract)
This lead to a few loophole, including the fact that you can force yourself as an employee to a company if :
* you had a temporary contract beforehand (CDD)
* your contract ended
* you still go to work, and nobody tells you nothing
If that happen and that you can prove that you indeed worked and nobody said anything to you in the mean time even though you were out of contract, that means that you ought to have a contract
But since you don't have a paper contract and that the only kind of employement that can be done without any paper contract is the permanent contract, you can bullshit your way out of the french legal system and ending up being employed full time as a permanent worker
Once you're there, you either have a full time job, or you get fired (which means that you will recieve a month of salary as a compensation)
But you'll be remembered as the asshole though
And a company in France have many means way to fire you indirectly (usually, they "force" you to give up your job)
It's not like this anymore
It was probably how it was intended, but I find hard to consider it as anything else but a loophole as it is clearly a shady move from the employee to do
In the same way, the same "loophole" can be applied to insurances and their tacite contract that force you as their customer for the smallest shit you ask them (my mother got scammed once by an insurance that insured her without her knowing it because she asked for a cost estimate of insuring her house)
In France we do not say "I love you", instead we say "je veux bien te laisser le quignon de la baguette", and I think it's beautiful
"tu es fort callipyge" with an eyebrow up
means "nice ass bb"
Can’t help but imagine you as a dwarf from Witcher
brings a tear to my eye
Don’t you ever say nice things to your right hand after sex
bah ce serait con de te priver si ta dulcinée a un bouliche qui flatte la rétine
That’s true as well, my girlfriend recently made a full Witcher 3 play through though so it’s more fresh
You are right, wouldn’t want to make the missus jealous
Coup d'Etat, what else
So our first ever President of the Republic was elected in 1848
As he could not be re-elected, not in the Constitution at the time, [he seized power in 1851 and made himself our Emperor] Him being Napoleon's nephew, he called himself Napoleon III (his cousin who would have been the number II was dead)
His reign lasted till 1870, when he fled to England after driving us to a severe defeat in a war against Prussia, (he got captured,  we lost a significant part of national territory, Alsace and Lorraine)
Killing his own political allies
Yes, Robespierre was
insane, to say the least
Second place is a coup d'Etat while in power, courtesy of Napoleon III
To be honest, despite our history of "constant" revolutions, I can't really think of a politiian that went as far as some in other countries, because, well, usually they would get kicked out before they could try to do anything
You could say Napoléon III maybe, became president then emperor
Mass murder (Reign of Terror)
Um, are you familiar with the Reign of Terror/La Terreur ?
Depends on the accent
French regional accents : they can be prone to friendly teasing, nothing serious
European accents, like Spanish, Italian, English or German : they can also be mocked but also considered cute or interisting
Arab or African accents : It makes the racist jump out of people and is often mocked and ridiculed
It has a generally bad rep associated to it
Overall I’d say foreigner are usually encouraged to get rid of their accent
Here, in France, regional accents are still a common things, especially in rural areas and small towns
However, there is sometimes a kind of discrimination against people with regional accents, especially in big cities such as Paris
Also there is a difference in how accents are seen: for instance, singing-like accents from Southern France are seen as beautiful, while accents from Northern France (Ch’ti) or Alsace, my region, are unfortunately seen as ugly
>Arab or African accents : It makes the racist jump out of people and is often mocked and ridiculed
It has a generally bad rep associated to it
True, usualy people start grouping around clapping hands, the street artists slip on an overall, starts missippi burning sound track, while some guy start carving a cross and an other one search on google map the closest gas station
Don't forget we are civilised, we know our classique
And yes there is cheese, wine and of course baguette
That’s not at all the way they’re seen where I am
We make fun (but not in a bad way) of the accents from Paris, Marseille and Toulouse, sometimes of the accents of the north of France
We say nothing of the accent from Alsace
The others are seen as either nonexistent or variations of the ones I already mentioned
Also, the accents from the south of France are considered heavy/thick here, not singing-like
Or you're teased if your accent is too bad too
The first part is true
In high school, people actually were pointing out my English accent for being "too good". My parents still do that when I speak English
The second part not so much, as a Parisian myself, I’ve never really met anyone hating anyone else for their accent besides the gentle teasing that everyone does
I do feel like the scum of the earth when I talk to people from other regions though
It really be hurting my fragile ego
I can confirm this happens every single day whenever an Arab accent is heard
This is just a daily routine
Just like any language, you can but it does take a lot of work
I’m actually a linguist and I studied that in university
It depends what your native language is and how different it is to French and how much you actively use the language on a daily basis, and the amounts of efforts you put in
That’s merely related, but I met a Dutch person who moved to France in his late 50’s the other day and his accent was impeccable
It can be done
But at the end of the day, accents don’t really matter that much and _in my opinion_ sounding like a native is not worth the enormous amounts of efforts it takes
They also learn the language, but it’s very hard to not have an accent
No matter how good I get at English, I will probably always have some sorts of accent if I don’t put enormous amounts of efforts into it
People with accents are encouraged to get rid a accent with implicit remarks like "Oh you’d be more professional if you got rid of that accent" for exemple
Yes, of course, a lot of people just don’t care
But some does, not a majority though
Here in Alsace, people from other regions either don’t care about our accent or think our accent is ugly
Living in the east, even our own accent was kinda considered ugly, or at the every least funny, for the people that had an heavier accent
Nobody ever said anything about Paris's accent though, to me Paris's accent is the lack of any accent with a mix of talking too fast
Paris definitely has an accent though
It’s seems to you like not but there is one
The area in France with the most neutral accent is Nantes
Maybe we do I don’t know
The only time I’ve heard of a Paris accent was when Le Rire Jaune (another Parisian oops) mocked the Rich Kid️ accent ("Papaaaaa j’ai perdu ma carte goldeuuuh")
But maybe we do have an accent and I have not noticed
And Nantes
I’ve always heard it was Tours
That’s so fun to think about for some reasons
Not at all, I do it as often as I feel like it, nobody cares, wether it's a place I come for the first time or one I'm used to
Not weird at all but boring in my eyes
I'd say it's okay I'm France to eat alone in a restaurant, especially if it's lunch time
But, if it's in the evening, then it could be a bit more weird because the dinner is considered as something done with your family
Maybe it's because in US restaurants are considered a bit fancier than in Europe and when then just want to eat but don't want to cook they go to the macdonald or something fast
While we will still go to a proper restaurant for just eating
Nobody cares
It's completely normal, at least for lunch
Lots of people kinda do their own thing during lunch time, and some people want to unwind
When I'm working for a company that ends the week  at noon on Friday, I like to just eat on a terrace, get a drink and slack for an hour or two
We don't have bounty hunters, that's the job of the law enforcer forces to find people
that is the highest proportion in the world
The Land of the free has the least amount of free people
This looks good, I think I'll try to make some
It sounds a bit like our ["pain surprise"] which is sometimes served for aperitive on nice occasions in France
Yes you are right, there is lots of specialty in all regions
Pizza is well known as italian food but it is not so many eaten in Italy, i would say no more than in the rest of europe or USA
Nowadays there are still fights to defend the Neapolitan pizza (Unesco), and to say that the pizza is initially the Italian product
Unlike pizza which has been very globalized, pasta is A serious thing in Italy imo and foreigners cannot imagine how much it is consumed by Italians and for foreigners who are not used to it, find them on the menu of restaurants every day, there is a culinary shock
I haven't tried it, but the Italian dish that astoned me the most when I heard about it was the Sicilian couscous
It really shows how diverse Italian cuisine is
Wait what, that's a thing
It must be regional, I have never heard of it, and I've lived in Drôme, Bouche du Rhône and IDF
It sounds great though, when is it usually made
It’s often served around end of the year festivities
You can find more than decent frozen ones in your Picard shops
I've seen them often dyring weedings/cocktails/aperitifs ...
Anytime a traiteur is there
I'd rather not try the frozen kind first tbh
Btw, where do you come from
I'm still trying to know where it's eaten
Honestly a bit everywhere I went
I am from north of France and currently living in Rhône and both places have them
Oh even in Rhône ? Funny, my uncle and sister live there and we never ate it
But I'm really intrigued now
Honestly get à Picard one, that’s what people take generally
Making one yourself would force you to cook six or seven different fillings and get a bread of the appropriate shape for a result that may end up being as good as the frozen ones in the end
Some dishes are better to cook yourself, this is honestly not one of those
45 in total:
39 cultural properties, 5 natural properties, and 1 is mixed
Arguably the most interesting (to me, anyway) would be the decorated caves of the Vézère Valley or Chauvet-Pont d’Arc
45, here is the list:
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
My favorite: Mont-Saint-Michel, Carcassonne, Canal du midi, Pont d'arc Cave
Honestly, might not be the taste of everyone, but I think the [Völklingen Ironworks] is one of the most cool
Did you ever visited the reconstitutions of these caves painting ?
I heard they scanned and 3D printed the whole cave, used the same methods to recreate the art and even ajusted the athmosphere so that when entering the museum it would feel just like the real thing (closed to public to prevent damage to the paintings)
Yes I did
And it was just like everything you mentioned
They even added in the fallen rocks that had detached themselves from the walls over the years
It felt completely like the real thing
Never heard of it
I never been but i want to go there sooo much !
The oldest debate in France is about the french name for  "chocolate bread". half of the country says the proper name is "pain au chocolat" where the other half is more in favor of "chocolatine". This is a very serious debate
Problem is particulary acute in summer, when 'pain au chocolat'  supporters are going on vacation in 'chocolatine' supporters land
You could have very problematic discussion about appropriate term for bread with chocolate bar inside in summer
Plus, in food related discussion, if you add wine discussion and how to accomodate perfectly food and wine,
you can say this is our main reason for living
In fact, every discussion in France about food, is more than serious
For example, another great discussion in France is about Cheese and Coffee
Is it appropriate or is it not to put cheese in coffee for breakfast ?
Traditionalists and people from north east are in favor of Coffee with cheese, where modernists tend to think it as a sacrilege from another time
We have another interesting debate about snails
We eat snails in France, just to prove to the rest of the world, that we can eat anything, I guess
Debate is about the taste of the snails
Do we eat snails because of the taste of the snail itself or because of the taste of the garlic butter around the snails ?
It is pretty hard to think that a snail has a taste by itself, but specialists of  "Héliciculture" (snails lovers) tend to think otherway
It's not half and half but more like 90%/10%.
It’s pain au chocolat dammit
In the south west that’s what we say and we have a lot of vacation tourists
Are you talking about the Atlantic coast-south-west
I lived 15 years in Alsace and I never heard anyone use "petit pain"
That’s just another overestimation but the other way lol
The pain au chocolat / chocolatine french [map]
Strictly speaking Quebec population is about 8 millions, a bit less than half french population
And I can just agree, Chocolatine is the right way and Québec has our back
Yes
As shown on the map
It is an atlantic debate not a mediterranean debate
>why not cut Camembert in squares then
Okay, man, you've officially taken it too far
Seriously
It is even [trendy]
Maroilles [cheese] The taste is far better than the smell
It is a cousin of the Munster
I think sürstromming can be acceptable as it's got a nice traditional charm, like everyone has those weird / disgusting dishes that their poor grandparents would enjoy on feast day or something
It's weird but unique
Apple mousse on literally everything, on the other hand, reminds me of the Netherlands in a "grown ups eating like 8 year olds left to make lunch alone".
Indeed, really really too far
If you go in that direction why not putting pineapple on a pizza
That's because Chocolatine karma is stronger than missiles so it makes them scared
we call this a bizutage in french
For France it's ok ... But I'd like to change how German countries call us : Frankreich
It's Frank kingdom and Frank is different than France historically
I'll go with the German and Dutch names, French Empire
I'd replace France with Motherland
M'y country is spelled the same in french ans in English, si it's not really necessary to change it
Frankia is cool tho
Just a closer prononciation to how France is said in french— with a long A. Maybe how some British pronounce France
I wouldn't. It's fine as it is
Never understood what happened with your country name
You call it Deutschland, english-speakers call it Germany, and we call it Allemagne
I wouldn't be surprised to see a 4th completely different name from another language at that point
Edit : ok, found
Saksa in Finnish
Niemcy in Polish
Vacija in Latvian
Did you all just went around Europe giving random names to everyone asking where you are from
Don't forget about Swaziland
Well, calling us Frankreich is no different than us calling them Allemagne
Yeah, that was under Louis XIV not Napoleon and the french word for tie is "cravate"
Reich is "fine", but Franks people were only a part of what became france, it's capital was Aix La Chapelle (Achen) and represented the "nordic" part of France, but more groups of people joined (visigots, Normands, ...) to make the France country
That's right
They were Frank and Charlemagne family were the Franks of I'm not mistaken ... So more french than Germans but still not French as it didn't exist at that time
Think of it like Kurds ... A "nation" sitting accross borders then split between France Belgium and Germany
Where is it and what is it ? Interested !
I love russian names and the nicknames that come with them, Aleksandr/Sasha/Alyosha, Mikail/Misha etc
But it would be strange
Boys: Ladislas, Iskandar (Alexender is good but damn Iskandar sound dopes as fuck)
Girls:Avdotia (even in Russia it's a very old name right
Japanese name "Kakashi". It French it sounds like "caca - chie", literally "poop - is pooping".
I love the name Kirill
What a cool name
I think you could prolly use these names in cities
Too bad, because Russian names are in fact quite popular in France, I know a few French called Dimitri, Boris, Tatiana, Nadège, Yvan, ...
I know where that's from
Or maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure
Means something like "held firmly".
Ah, I wasn't sure actually, thanks for the precision
Do it, the knights tippler
I know a few as well (didn't even know Nadège was russian
), but the nickname/first name combo is what I really love, and that practice isn't coming to France any time soon
Lol, that's what happen when you take a liking of a character from the Russian literature of the 19th century
I immediately think about the red baron, but that's certainly because I am not German
You have a cat, and he likes to sit on your keyboard
With Ericsson, I bet it does !
Wrong
Most people wear clothes with logos on them, be it a jacket, shoes or a bag
I don't if they want me to publicities something, I would want to get paid
For people from outside Europe it's not that difficult
For them Europeans might have more similarities than differences, such as we might see more similarities than differences in different Asian cultures or African cultures
From that point of view, Europeans are pretty similar (general looks, clothing style, food, music, architecture, etc
are generally closer from one European country to another than to African or Asian cultures)
Idk things related to food (no doggie bags, no huge quantities) and even then, there may be European countries that are very generous when serving food
Let's say it's not UNcommon, but it's considered as a pretty pricy and middle-uper class clothing brand in Europe, so you would not see a lot of people wearing Columbia clothes during the day
Switzerland
The bureaucracy , petty rules, the amount of red-tape, the insistence on sharing washing machines / tumble driers and the horrendous housing market made the whole experience less than enjoyable
However, it is still a beautiful, clean, quiet country
Nothing romantic, but 20 years ago going to Denmark I felt it was a great country in advance regarding the wind energy development as a saw multiple fields of wind turbines and was amazed by that view as it was the first time seeing that many
Now I know they rely heavily on German coal / gas electricity and I feel that it’s not as great as it seems
> is how prevalent homeopathy seems to be in pharmacies, like WTF
Do not come to France for your own safety mate
We're the America of Europe in regard of anti-vax/homeopathy/"alternate-sciences"
It's really saddening
Homeopathy is also very much present in France
They are covered by our healthcare
However, since lobbies weren't able to prove its efficiency, it's not going to be the case anymore
A French person complaining is pure immersion
Really ?? Is it because you have an advanced level in French so you're able to talk about politics in class or is it just because your teacher wants to ? I remember learning things like the segregation in the US in English class or the fight against the mafia in Italian class but this wasn't all year, we learn more "basic" things as well
For me it was around 2012 when they all protested to shut down nuclear energy, which is pretty safe and efficient in Europe, and started to re-open  so many coal power plants
I can totally understand your disappointment if your mental image of Paris was based on glamorous films and perfume ads
Unfortunately, that's a very unrealistic view
Paris is a crowded, hectic megacity
For many people, it's a place to work or live in, not an open-air museum
Gare du Nord for exemple is dirty and some louche people hang around but it's also the [busiest] train station in Europe by a large margin
Sadly, many tourists arrive from there and choose a hotel in that neighborhood to be close to the station
In the same way, people often complain about Parisians being rude but most people in massive cities (New York for exemple) are cold and distant
You also have to keep in mind that Paris is the most visited city in the world, so Parisians see A LOT of tourists
In Europe, only London or Moscow have a similar feel in my view
That being said, I don't think that Paris resembles the rest of France
Paris is pretty dirty, for many reasons
I can be safe anytime at night but you need to know your ways around the city
Where were you staying that you found Paris dangerous
I've been going home completely drunk, falling asleep in taxis for years and never once felt unsafe, and it's not like I grew up here, I grew up in the countryside far away from Paris
Same for me
Not sure how recent for you, but for me disappointment started with neo-con era (Thatcher UK and Reagan USA)
At least you can drive on the middle lane without your car shedding bolts
You feel you've entered belgium rather than see it lol
I mean I often stay in the middle lane because the right lane is for trucks and entering the highway and left lane is for speeding
If I'm too slow I'll go to the right lane obviously
Mdr c'est un belge qui dit ça
I thought at the beginning that you were going to criticize cuisine at the beginning and I would have answered that of course cuisine is bad in tourist traps
Turns out it wasn't the case
What do I have to answer to that
Well yes, if a restaurant close we have no information
Yes, it's very difficult and it should change
Although if you go to a restaurant outside of the opening hours that's normal
That was also my opinion on Amsterdam the first two times I visited, but the third time I had a lovely visit of everything where tourists usually don't go and didn't see many drugs and sex stores
Nobody likes Marseille aside from people who grew up there anyway
That can't be the reason, most flats in Paris also have washing machines
Sometimes when it's really small they put a small size machine, but unless you have less than 10 m² you'll have a washing machine
Yes
The norm in France is to have your own washing machine / tumble drier
In smaller flats, they're generally in the kitchen or in the bathroom rather than in the laundry room
The only exception to that rule are very small, very cheap flats in Paris (10m2 flats for exemple), generally located in lower-income neighborhoods, and student halls
It’s true for a lot of people and a lot of cities (the Paris syndrome is well known in Japan)
People are expecting to see only the brightest things they see in ads, films or books
They tend to forget that cities are places to work/live in the first place, not some kind of museum or Skansen
Oh it's completely that
It's the same as when Brits are saying "London's a shit hole and *does not* represent the whole country
It's the same for Paris, except that people's expectations of Paris are even higher than people's expectations of London I'd say
Which is always very saddening because there's so much variety in France
We've got mountains, ocean and see litorals, plains etc
And people generally just go to Paris
>some ***louche*** people
Je t'aime
> the UK are super London centric
Well, erm, France is one of the most capital centred country in the world I'd say
I do understand why people mostly come to Paris even though it's a shame
Everything happens in Paris
Politics, art, sport etc*. France is very, *very* centralised towards its Capital unfortunately
*Not saying there is absolutely *nothing* outside of Paris, but there is way less important national or international thing
I'd say your social policies are bad, when they are not completely inexistant depending on the period
You're really known to be a country where it's best not to be poor*, and Thatcher made sure of that
Moreover I'd also say that even though class struggle/warfare is something every country encounter, it's really at its peak in the UK
*Of course being poor is shitty every where, but it just seems like it's even harden in the UK
You seem like this *really* capitalistic and neoliberal country where everyone will say it's your fault and your fault o my if you're poor
I know it certainly is a cliché, but don't cliché come from some kind of truth
I'd like to have your view on everything I just said, because it's just a foreign point of view, and a lot of things might've changed in the last two decades
Edit: also I'm not OC but I was really interested in the topic and wanted to talk about it
Oh ok
That makes sense, as I'm only B2 in English and B1 in Italian and I'm still in high school lol
Would love to reach the C1 level one day !
> Every RER employee I met tried to help me screw the system so we wouldn't have to pay as much
Man, you missed an opportunity to play the lotterie during your visit
Because damn if that's the most unexpected thing from your comment
Haha, j'adore ce mot dans les deux langues
Do you have an example for that
Usually restaurants open at 19:00 and if it's in a crowded place you'll have two services : 19:00 - 20:30/21:00 and 20:30/21:00 - ~23:00
In tourist spots some restaurants open all day (and even all night in some cities), they might not be great though
I mean if you had turned off the plancha and cleaned it, I'd understand that you wouldn't redo all that work again just for one toasted croissant
Yes I totally understand
Actually a lot of things in small towns like this are often unreliable
Maybe what happened to you is exceptional but it doesn't surprise me
When that happens we just go to another restaurant, if you really wanted to eat here you'll eat here next time, but I understand it is very annoying for tourists, especially in remote places like this
Yep
I agree with you though, that's dumb
I use mine once a week and buying such a machine for 50 uses a year is not really ecological
Hum, might've been during a stricke, that's really uncommon
I think it's just more common in Europe, you can't get anything at any time of the day
It might be cultural
I'd be happy to try to help you with the French surname but I'm not sure what you'd like to know
I don't really understand what you were trying to say about French surnames
What I can tell you is that surnames that are prefixed by "de", meaning "from" - which is NEVER capitalized by the way - are usually associated with the aristocracy, although that is not a hard rule
A lot of names start with D in general because they are compressed forms of "de"  or "du" + something
Other than that I don't really know
> Plus, the French surnames with -eaux etc
I'm not sure what you're asking here but there isn't any logic related to -eaux endings that comes to mind, that's just how those names end
In French, there is no real "son of" particule added to surnames (like could be the *ssen, *son, * ski/ska in other languages)
The "de" particule is more related to places and/or nobility
We have a splendid example among French politicans
Philippe de Villiers full name is actually Philippe Marie Jean Joseph Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon
So his real surname is Le Jolis de Villiers, and is indicative of a nobility title (adding de Villiers to his family name Le Jolis)
The addition of "de Saintignon" comes from his paternal grand-mother Jeanne de Saintignon, another noble French family
Then again, "de" is primarily indicative of a place, but the claim through a family name of a geographical origin is often related to the fact that it is/was the family fiefdom
No resentful at all, but sometimes I wish native english spoken people realize more how lucky and  privileged they are: it's easier to find a job in their country of in foreign countries, your are better paid, easy to travel, others have to make the offert, not you, easier to find more information online, school is easier too because even if foreign languages are teached in those countries, it's ok to fail and it's not that important, it's great but not essential, they have more time/energy to focus on maths, science,  etc etc
Even on Reddit: I'm not fluent in english, so it take me time and more effort to write a comment and sometimes I don't write something I want to say just because it's no difficult or wouldn't worse the effort
And I can't express myself exactly how I want to so sometime people get angry by misanderstanding what I wrote
We will just make sure it doesn't take over ours
The only thing annoying is marketing idiot who abuse of english language
For exemple today, i used glass cleaner and it was not writed "Lave Vitre" but "GlassCleaner"...
It wouldn't be my first choice for a lingua franca (my first choice would have been any language that is not complete bullshit, like Spanish or German, to name a few I'm familiar with), but it's better than not having one at all, for sure
As for how I cope with the cultural hegemony achieved by the *Perfide Albion*, i take solace in the fact that English's got so many french words, it's basically just mispronounced French anyway
actually no ! English is a great language and besides, having a « common » language allow people like us in this sub who are from different countries with different languages to talk together
also English is pretty simple to talk (not perfectly but enough to be understood)
On one hand, it's great that we have a universal language, allowing people to communicate more easily (like on this sub)
On the other hand, it kind of makes it feel like it's useless to learn other languages besides English
Yes
As a *lingua franca*, a universal language, I believe English is not ideal
Although I'm lucky to have learned English by living abroad from a young age, I'm frustrated by the fact that English is a difficult language to learn
As a Frenchman, English is not *that* difficult, because our languages share roots and a lot of vocabulary thanks to our friend William the Conqueror
And yet we could choose a universal language that would be much easier to learn for everyone, allowing for potentially billions of hours and dollars saved
This could either be an existing language or a constructed language, like Toki Pona
Yes that's an annoying *scenario*.
The curse of this language
Easy to start with
hard as hell to master
I don't really pity them, there is worse in life than only knowing one language
But I find that even if most of them knows it's great to speak english to travel most of them don't realize how difficult it can be for many people to learn a new language not because you wants to but because you are forced to if you want to succeed
Most english native speakers don't use a second language, some need it for their job but it's not the norm
Here for many job, not all of them but many, speaking english is needed
I rarelly see american/australia/brits etc
speaking french, most of them just remember a few words from school, but those who learnt it properly are generally very good at it
>When it comes to jobs, native English speaking people only get an edge if it's really related to the language (translation, transcription, etc), otherwise they're hardly any better off compared to someone who speaks English fluently but not natively
Same for traveling or finding information online
That's the point, the english speaking person didn't have to make the effort to effort to learn a language to find a job and had more time to learn an other skill instead
I had to learnt english for work and I don't work for a translation job
That's the point, he the ukrainian guy had to learn english to find a job in Norway, while a british for exemple wouldn't have to learn it to get that job
The ukrainian guy had to work harder in a way
Germany: been there, done that
Multiple time
Now both countries are like a couple, which mean we care for each other but are always arguing on small things
Switzerland: not really a topic
I've heard a lot of Swiss come to France for health issues since their hybrid public/private healthcare is very costly
Some French are working over the border since the wages are way better
Italy: culturally close so everything is fine
We have a shared interest into food, fashion, and public deficit
Also we are both latin countries
Spain: not really a topic except the whole Catalogne thing
There is a lot of regionalism in France, so the government really dislike the idea of an European region trying to get its independence
It may give bad ideas to Bretagne or Alsace, you see
UK: their food is awful, the Brexit is stupid, they have a monarch while everything is obviously fine without one
We always have something to criticize about them because, in fact, we really do love these bastards
Belgium: you mean the soon-to-be new Hauts-de-France ? Nah I'm just kidding
We are pretty close culturally because the South Belgium speaks French
We don't really care about North Belgium because they do not speak French
Also their accent is funny and our jokes about them are terribles
Luxembourg: a very few people know about this country except from a fiscal point of view, except in the east of the country
A lot of students from Luxembourg are studying in the east (Nancy, Metz, Strasbourg) while a lot of French are working in Luxembourg (mainly living around Metz and Thionville)
The Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFIP, taxpayer's nightmare) hate them, still
Belgium  - This is probably our neighbours with whom we have the most links
The French part loves us and we love them too, some even like to consider it as a French region
Many people spend a day or a weekend there and many artists are extremely well known in France
It's not surprising to find Belgians who have come to live in the north of France
Germany  - I know that we have fought 3 wars in 100 years, 2 of which were among the deadliest in history, but today there is no longer any direct tension between our countries
A lot of French people close to the border will spend a day or a weekend in Germany sometimes
But there are still a lot of people who don't like Germany because they see the country as the "leader" of the European Union and want a system based more on a Europe of nations (it comes from De Gaulle)
Switzerland  - We only know the part of Switzerland that speaks French and we like them a lot, we don't know too much about the rest
It doesn't look like it, but a lot of famous French people were born in Switzerland like Jean-Paul Marat, Rousseau or Napoleon III, so our stories are really interconnected
Italy  - I say this because I live less than 100km from the border but I think they are our favourite neighbours
We have a fascination for the Italians, their culture, their gastronomy that we see as almost on a par with our own
We love to go there and spend a few days in Turin, Genoa or Milan
Monaco  - It's a city-state where most people speak French
The people who go there are either because they are millionaires or because they want to look at the beautiful cars while walking along the beach
Spain  - We don't speak much about Spanish people in France (the last time we talked about it was with the history of Catalonia)
Nice people that many people see as a poorer country than us, so cheaper and go there mostly to buy cheap products and resell them in France
It's quite sad, but we still enjoy the landscape and the climate when we go there
Andorra  - I've never heard anyone talk about it, not many people go there
I don't know much about them, they must be nice I guess
EU FTW
As long as we're a thing, most of us don't have to worry about warring between ourselves, and it's a powerful enough defensive pact  to dissuade any neighbourg \*cough\*Russia\*cough\*. Stronger than NATO actually
It's really sad how much Italians seem to hate us
It's always the consensus during those questions and we actually like Italy and Italians so it's always kind of heartbreaking and I just don't get it
German food is quite good but it always bugs me when I take the ICE from Paris to Strasbourg, you people are opening tin can beers at 17 ? And eating at 18 ??? Also there is no separation in your train so there is food smells everywhere past 18
It's disturbing because at 18 I maybe had a sweet snack one hour ago and I'm not expecting to eat before 20
Best friends except North-Belgium did their best to cut off most of the federal funding in favor of regional funding for public services
But our government's choices are our own and don't impact you, and honestly Italians hating on us because of politics is irony of the highest level
Calm down V
I'm French
I had friends living in Liège and they were pretty salty about it a few years ago when the law was about to be adopted
Since the North is wealthier than the South, regional funding of public services mean less funds in Wallonie
Actually I'm pretty jealous about the weather
I'm working in Paris and I had this colleague during a few months working remotely from Firenze
Our daily meetings with webcam on were very painful, he was drinking his coffee in front of his co working place, sunbathing, while I just came out of 30 minutes of crowded subway and it rained the whole week
I'm thinking about moving in another country in a few years, and Italy is in my top 3 actually
I see, from your examples I only know of Gaddafi but barely because I was too young at the time (I think it was 10 years ago
) but I understand how that can be an issue
Great to know, I never visited the area of Bologna
I already visited Genova, Roma, Pisa, Milano and Isola d'Elba, and I keep great memories from these places
I'm not planning to move by necessity, I just aspire to see new things !
In Alsace some people speak Alsatian, a germanic dialect very close to german with borrowed french words
The language is dying thought, it is still spoken in villages by old people but in Strasbourg (main city in Alsace) you will hardly hear Alsatian
Everyone speaks french or german
I know a little bit of Alsacien, native to the region of Alsace on the German border, it's a dialect of German with some French elements and it's dying out, like most regional dialects in metropolitan France
In under a century, Alsacien went from being the region's inhabitants' native language to being very rarely spoken by anyone under 40
Today, the elderly natives always speak it natively, my parents' generation often learned it alongside French but then didn't pass it on to their children
I make active efforts to learn some of it, but I have no doubt that in a generation or two it'll be almost if not entirely dead
I won't go into the history of why this is the case because this comment is already long enough, but this is common to most dialects in metropolitan France and Alsacien is one of the few dialects that's still relatively alive
In France there's almost a specific language for envry region but it's very likely to French
I think the most popular and spoken language is the "breton"
In the "drom com" (the French isles) they almost all speak "creole" it's a mix beetwen French and old African
Is it close to Corsican
À Strasbourg on entend de l'alsacien de temps en temps, et pas de mal de monde cale quelques mots alsaciens du genre un schlouks
Mais c'est vrai que le dialect se perd
I come from the area of Mulhouse (South Alsace) and I speak alsatian, my grand-parents taught me how to speak it and always prefered speaking Alsatian than French
It also helped a lot to be fluent in German
Nowadays Alsatian is regaining its popularity amongst the younger generation (mainly in rural areas)
There isn't a single creole, most ex French colonies have their own creole which take elements from French, whatever the local language was before colonization, and any other languages brought by their speakers
\> That's like taking a Bavarian dialect and calling it its own language
No, it's like taking an germanic dialect and calling it a dialect
I can't speak german or alsatian but apparently even though alsatian is pretty close to german, it's not 100% similar, it forms some sort of dialectal continuum accross the french/germany/switzerland border but the further you go in Germany the less you will understand the german they speak
That's why some school offer both Alsatian AND German classes
Everybody just called it "German" before the French-Prussian war
Ca fait que deux ans que je vis à Stras mais je n'ai jamais entendu quelqu'un dire "schlouks" lol, ca veut dire quoi ?
For a long time, the French were big fans of centralization, they wanted everything to be centralized in France
This includes the language, everyone needs to be speaking the same language, and a common language encourages nationalism and reduces the risk of creating a real will for independence
So for the last few centuries (especially after WW1 when France got Alsace-Moselle back) it has been a big issue to make it so alsaciens felt right at home in France, despite being culturally closer to the German neighbors
The consequence of this is that regional dialects are kind of seen as ugly weird languages only lower class people speak, while when you're educated, you speak good French
This connotation led our grandparents not to encourage Alsacien speaking without forbidding it (like in school at one point) and then our parents would prefer French, because they probably spoke it better too
The French government had a big part to play in the erasing of Alsacien language, as well as that of many regional dialect, and consequently, culture
En plus les dialectes n'existe pas vraiment, c'est juste un terme politique pour dénigrer la valeur des autres langues de la même famille
Une gorgée. C'est utilisé dans toute l'Alsace
Y a même une application sur Strasboirg "Schlouk map" qui indique tout les bars de la ville :)
That strikes don't work anymore and haven't in a while
Some countries are doing some wine with a quality that can definitely outcompete ours
We're a minor country and our system isn't going well
Our country isn't doing as bad as people like to think
Sure, we're not the superpower we once were but if you talk to some French you would think we are a third-rate country
For god's sake, we're in the top 10 if not 5 of almost everything
Economy, Army, Diplomaty, Food Quality even our National Railroad thé SNCF isn't as bad as people like to say
85% rate in ponctuality ? Yeah Say that to a French and he will laugh
>That we are not as great, as powerful, as respected and admired as we once were
This is pretty weird to me has I don't think France ever was that much great/respected or admired
To me France never realy gave a fuck on how she was perceived and was diplomaticaly very pragmatic
Fought protestant with in her country while defending them outside of it, same with muslim/Ottoman
I mean historicaly, France was never realy that much above the rest of europe and kept fighting for her survival against on one side the English on the other the Hasburg and the rare times she wasn't at war with her neighbours she was fighting herself
I don't feal like in France you have that kind of English misplaced pride to believe that we "owned" half of the world, or like we conquered Europe, or we created the USA, etc
French usualy don't realy feal concerned nor invest in those historical event
Mostly because of the numerous regime that we had and that no one claims the paternity of our history in a whole since it mostly got there by over throwing the precedent
I think that most of the "arrogant french" cliché come from the fact that french just don't admit that anyone or anything is above them by essence, but that is well rooted in our culture
I mean we killed monarchie, killed god and we are still around
The US/Russia don't realy impress us, like India/China
I mean it's not because English and it's culture has taken over the world, that we should capitulate to it if we don't agree, nor do we think this might not change like our history has tought us
EDIT: Just to make things clear, I clearly don't believe that France is heaven on earth but to me right now, the hard to swallow pill would be more to get rid of all the boomer mess and delirium they made
Like retirement, get of stalinist syndicat, schizophrénic left that shit on colonialism but still wants to live on high standard that it allowed, corrupted liberals and of course the politicaly impaired like FN and FI
Tbh yes France isn’t as great as it once was but it honestly isn’t as bad as a lot of people think (yes France is a major power and diplomatically/culturally the nation is one of the most important in the world)
Yeah, tell me about it
Well, if you Can talk to your neighbors about not going to my country to put your trash on the side of the road, it would be a start
Too much strike kills the power of strike
It's time for strikes and protests to be used by the working class for real social issues, as they were originally meant to be, and not any more for whining about first world problems
To me, it's the exact opposite
We're doing far better than most frenchs like to say
But you're proving my point i guess
I was really really impressed when I went to Chile, wasn't expecting the wine there to be that good tbh
It's in French, but i dont have a better one
10 tons each year
It's in French, but i dont have a better one
10 tons each year
That's protecting World heritage
Not that shitty of a thing
Then take it, stop wasting time
I feel like I know quite a bit, and I feel closer to you guys than to many European countries
Though I've never been to any North African country, I know plenty of people with familial ties there, some of whom do go there relatively often
I guess you know about France already
I’d just like to point out the topics students in prepa lettres study this year in history: "France & Africa (1830-1962)" plus "Rome & Carthage (5th-1st centuries before Christ)”. So it’s not only about the Maghreb, but it’s included
The dates are actually more complex than that for the second but yeah, the spirit is what’s important: a large part of future history teachers in France will be people who spent a year studying these two topics
I feel like we’re
moving on
I’m glad I studying colonization in depth for once
I would believe the most knowledgeable would be the Spanish, the French, and maybe the Italians
I’m a French Sephardic Jew so I feel well connected
The Maghreb has been home to Jewish people for millennia and many of us still have family there
For French Sephardim, even if we’ve been in France our whole lives and our parents’ lives, our culture is still a good mix of cultural practices, foods, languages, music, etc
I’ve been to Morocco before and I’d like to go back
I’m especially interested in Algerian Jewish culture, a lot of my community have Algerian heritage
Unfortunately Algeria has recently been (and maybe still is) one of the most dangerously antisemitic places in the world, so Jewish life has been all but extinguished
maybe not an ideal holiday destination at the moment
One day, though
Algeria has actually always had really strong ties with Russia, since the independence !
I am not
The French resistance during WWII would work really well
La Révolution
it would be interesting to say the least
Really
I need to check out
beaufs
Cul terreux
Muddy ass
[Damn right]
Kéké works as well
&#x200B;
But yeah Beaufs is defintively the main word
From the french swiss perspective, german swiss (bourbines) are the chavs there
already knew what it was even before clicking
When I think of kéké all I can picture is Franck Dubosc
[good times]
Ou encore des ploucs
We also have "prolo" which comes from "prolétaire" (same meaning as Proletarier I believe) but that means poor here
Les ploucs c'est les beaufs de la campagne, c'est les Kékés des prés quoi
Aren't hobos closer to racaille than chavs
Wallah en France aussi
Spanish: Easiest to understand, especially written
If they speak slow enough it's possible to understand what they say
Italian: Kinda the same as for Spanish, it's quite okay as long as they speak slowly, you can kinda know what they're talking about but you don't understand everything
Catalán: Weird mix between French and Spanish, but it's impossible to understand to me, at least when spoken
Portuguese: Can grasp a few things here and there when written, but can't understand anything when spoken
Romanian : Maybe will understand a few words and there in writing but that's all
Nothing when spoken
Italian and Spanish are very close languages from french so it's very easy to understand without learning any words
Now that I learned english, I am able to understand few words in danish an japanese because this language has many words inspired from english words (ex : butter/batâ ; pocket/poketto)
Italian: I can understand it relatively well when spoken or written, but I cannot speak it
I can grasp what a conversation is about
Spanish: I can understand it well when written, but oh God people speak so quickly
I cannot understand a spoken conversation because of the speed
Portuguese: Sometimes I understand a word or two when written, but more generally no I can't understand it
Romanian: no
Italian : I get the general sense but couldn't compose a sentence
Portuguese : same
Spanish : same
Canadian french : we get all of it but some words have different meanings, usually slang, so it can get confusing
Romanian : I get nothing orally but some words ring a bell (probably because I took latin in school)
In French a lot of the words resemble Italian like « promotion » is « promozione » or « écharpe » (scarf in French) is « scarpa »
Also almost all the words ending with TION sound the same if not spelled exactly the same way
Exemple:
Intervention
Promotion
Legalisation
Motion
Juxtaposition
I understand 80% of written spanish because virtually all the words sound similar to french or have a common root with french words, but spoken spanish is really hard to understand especially spanish from spain
Spanish from Argentina or Mexico sounds easier because they speak slower and articulate more
But overall, written spanish is easier to understand than spoken spanish
Italian is even easier, it's like a wierd cousin of French tbh
If you really focus you can understand half of what they say
Written is even easier, like 90% of it is understandable
For example i take a random sentence from  the homepage of wikipedia italy:
"Nella tecnica delle ferrovie si definisce tender un veicolo destinato a trasportare il combustibile e l'acqua necessari per il funzionamento di una locomotiva a vapore
Without looking anything up, here is how i can translate it to french in my head :
"En technique ferroviaire se définit "tender" (i don't know what that is) comme un véhicule destiné à transporter le combustible et l'eau nécessaire pour le fonctionnement d'une locomotive à vapeur"
See, only one word that i couldn't figure out
Spanish is more or less the same :
"El parque nacional de la Sierra de Guadarrama es un área protegida de las provincias españolas de Madrid y Segovia
En 2015, con 2 989 556 visitantes, fue el segundo parque nacional más visitado de España, tras el parque nacional del Teide (Tenerife)
How i undestand it : "Le parc national de la Sierra de Guadarrama est une aire protégée de la province espagnole de Madrid et Segovia
En 2015, avec 2989556 visiteurs, elle fut le deuxième parc national le plus visité d'Espagne, après le parc national del Teide (Tenerife)".
You can see the similarities yourself
Again though, spanish people speak super fast and it sounds like they don't articulate much so when they speak it's really hard
I don't know much about Portuguese though, but from what i've seen it's very close to Spanish
I'd say i can make out 50-60% of it (written)
Romanian is definitely harder, i can make out maybe 40% of it (written) ?
Never heard it so I couldn't say
Hey you're talking about guillotines and all, so I'm gonna go slightly offtopic and talk about torture
During the Algeria war, we used the *gégènes*, which are affectuous nicknames for *generators*. You get it, they were radio generators that were used to
cook the unwilling soldier
Typically, you put one electrode on the ear and the other on the genitals
It was so effective we even inspired Pinochet with it !
... The guillotine
You almost made me spit my coffee
That's like
a bit excessive
even to my taste
That's imaginative at least
Well we aren't known for our good mastery of foreign languages
Pretty common in France; you can find it for regional languages starting in kindergarten, and for foreign languages it's an option in most high schools (usually English or German, sometimes Spanish or Italian)
It's very rare and there are very few highschools that have this kind of classes and a bit more universities
Nagyon jol hangzik :D
He means teaching non-language-related courses in a foreign language
It's not very common in France, but it does exist
There is for instance the [C.I.V.] close to me
They teach some courses in either English, Chinese, Italian, ...  And it's a state school, so basically free
I know what they mean otherwise I wouldn't have said it was an option
Not in metropolitan France anymore, most separatists movements turned into sorts of political search for more regional representation (like teaching local dialects in schools, funding for regional cultural affairs and stuff)
However, Corsica has an independence party currently ruling, and some of our ultramarine (= overseas) territories are actively seeking independence (New Caledonia has a referendum pending i think)
France doesn't know what you mean
*Sweats in català*
Scania is no joke
Scania needs to be Danish to restore the balance in the force
There are some separatist movements, but none are really big or serious
It's partly due to the consistent effort, over the last 150 years, to remove all cultural singularities in metropolitan France
Nonetheless, these cultural singularities are coming back and here to stay, probably not as independentist movements but probably more as decentralization/autonomization movements
About New Caledonia : the Nouméa Agreements set 3 referendums which question is : "Do you want New Caledonia to access full sovereignty and become independant ?".
One was held in 1987, one in 2018, and one will be held on the 06/09/2020 (DD/MM/YYYY for our american fellows)
In 1987, the independentists were boycotting the vote, which led to the "No" winning with 97,8% of votes
In 2018, "No" won with 56,8%.
I doubt the "Yes" will win in 2020, but the margin is thin enough that there cannot be any certitude
From the french swiss, i just hear them saying that the german swiss are dumb and racist
But i think that's just the "city VS rural area" thing, and not the communities
? Ce n'est pas un problème pour nous
They want both independence and more money from gov
Yeah, i have never heard a corsican said that he want to join Italy, it's rather independance (few), more autonomy (that's what they are going to have), or just stay like they are
But, the thing, that they will all (or nearly that) take back into the discussion is the short corsican republic that have been invaded by France
Sweden
Denmark
Norway
Finland
Long ago, the four nations lived in harmony
But this changed when Sweden attacked
You wish
In french we have the same word for both father-in-law and stepfather which is "beau-père". Same with mother-in-law and stepmother (which is "belle-mère"), but there are two different words for sister/brother-in-law ("belle-sœur/beau-frère") and stepsister/brother ("demi-sœur/frère"), it can be a little bit confusing
“Serviette” means both napkin and towel in French
Beaux parents both means in laws and step parents in French
Got me a few times that one
Same in French, with use corbeau for both
Same in French, both ravens and crows are just *corbeaux*.
Mmmh
So what about [Corneille] and [Corbeau] then
Not the same separation I think
Crow and Raven both are Corbeau, and I think Corneille is different
ault for example
I just clicked the "change language" feature on wikipedia on [Crow] and [Raven] respectively, so I think the distinction is actually the same in both languages
Oh well
We still have the chouette/hibou for the English Owl
French more than anything, tbh I've moved around so much that it'd be hard to identify with one region specifically
From Ile-de-France, just nearby Paris, I'm used to be considered Parisian, but I'd say it comes third after French and European
I identify myself as french then lorraine/vosgienne then as western european
I'm French and Lorrain
Both have relatively equal places in my heart
Yes especially Quebec and Wallonia
\- building tree houses
\- bike
\- playing in the river/forest/dirt
\- Drawing/painting/playdoh
\-  board games
\- playground games: pogs, marbles, pokemon cards, rope

Focus (likewhen french people like me pronounce it, it sound like f\*ck us)
and throughout, it doesn't sound consistent, more like someone chocking on food
Also the difference between though and saw it tiny to my ears
Same with war/wore/were/whore etc
Squirrel
The word designed to torture students whatever the language
Écureuil, Eichhörnchen, squirrel
Room
Return, and of course The Rural Juror (are there 30 Rock fans here
Basically anything that starts with an r. The English r is just a nightmare, I either do a straight-up French r which sounds, well, very French, or something closer to a w, which sounds ok when it's inside a word, but awful at the start
I have to force myself to pronounce properly the "th" sound
Flour, I cannot figure out where to place it in the spectrum between floor and flower
Mostly I can't get the rhythm right (am French, dunno if my flair is active) and I am very inefficient and lose breath pretty quickly as I overcorrect my pronunciation with it/hit/eat/heat ship/chip/sheep/cheap
Squirrel - I just can't, years after years
Funny thing, it's also quite hard for English speaking people to pronounce the French translation - écureuil
Not only hard to pronounce but also I never remember how to write "neighborhood"
I am completely incapable of pronouncing the name of the town Fort Lauderdale, which is pretty awkward as I go there around 3 times per year
That's because it's a French word and the English pronunciation is trying to follow the French pronunciation but not quite
See also: oeuvre
Don't worry with the french R, foreign french teacher love to make a big deal of it and calling it "the french R" but actually we have different one: rolled R, german R, a R that sound like the spanish J but softer etc
we use everyone according to our regional accent, if we speak fast or not, if it's easier to pronounce, if we want to accentuate on a word etc etc
so just do the one you can do and it's fine
Well yes I can hear a difference between on and un/on/en, those sounds completely different to me, but not really between un and in for example
I know how to pronounce though and saw but the difference is tiny to my ears: if you pronounce them apart and you articulate well I obviously hear the difference, but in a sentence or if I don't really pay attention or the person just speak fast the difference can be harder to hear
Okay thanks ! Now how do i pronounce wheat ? Like in sweet ? You know, so i can make the distinction between a janitor and a baker (wet floor / wheat flour)
[Is it schedule or schedule
I don't know enough about german (i learnt english, spanish and chinese ) to tell
About the difference between en and other it's tricky: en in "bien" sound like "in" in "calin". But en in "content" sound like "an" in "maman". So there is (for us) a big difference between an/in/on but en can be like an or in depending of context
Also in and un are supposed to sound different but in modern french we pronounce it the same
To me an in maman, on in mouton and in in calin sound as different that O with A and I in the alphabet
Foreigners also have trouble to make a difference between é and è but to us it's pretty obvious
But it's ok if you can't make a difference because in the region é and è sounds in words are reverse
For exemple: Lait (milk): I pronounce it lè while my friends from the north say lé like in les
I think it have a lot to do with the culture and the beer culture
In Germany, beer is not a drink to get drunk but a drink
In UK, it's more about getting drunk
I have only been to the UK a few times, but from what I have noticed one of the main differences is the curfew in the UK
Because of the curfew, people in the UK tend to rush to the pub directly after work and get drunk as fast as they can, as the pub will close at one point
In Germany there's no curfew, so in my experience people tend to first go home after work, eat dinner and then meet up in a bar much later
There's no pressure to get drunk as fast as possible as many bars close very late or do not even close at all before sunrise
So people might drink as many beers or maybe even more in one night, but not as fast
As a student in Germany it was quite usual to meet up with friends in a bar at 21:00 or even 22:00 in the night and drink beer for hours, you'll drink a lot, sometimes more then 10 large beers (0,5L) but you'll stay only tipsy or slightly drunk for hours, without ever getting shitfaced
Also, typical German beers are quite low on alcohol levels, 4,5-5° maybe, in the UK other types of beer with higher alcohol content might also be popular
Canada feels both familiar and foreign at the same time
It is hard to say for France
Maybe the UK because of history
Or Poland or Ireland because of the independence and catholic spirit
Romania for the love of culture
Or Russia because of the Revolution and the feeling of being unique and universal
But at the end of the day, only Rome worth Paris, and only Paris worth Rome
Not similar at all but I’d say this mutual obsession you mentioned would actually be between France and Japan rather than Finland
Northern England and the North of France feels very very similar because of the working class culture/coal mines
Even the architecture (red bricks working class housing)
Yeah it's a bit uncanny
In francophone places, you'd think we're the same because of the language but then the north american culture hits you right in the face
> the more powerful neighbor
Damn Belgians
I dont think you understood the question
How are the UK, Ireland and Rome far from France
The Japanese government since Meiji restoration is actually based largely on the German Empire’s government and legal system
The Japanese legal system is greatly inspired and draws heavily from German civil law to this day
Source:
The distance is more cultural here: the Anglo Saxon world vs the Latin world
definitely not far away though, even culturally
I wasn't that disoriented when I lived in England compared to most other countries
The landscape itself is not unique at all but [you can see England] from the Côte d’Opale (North of France) on sunny days
Probably the [Wild Coast of Quiberon] which is still a fair drive away
Brocéliande forest is also pretty nice
I can think of a few incredible landscapes:
\- Le [Mont St Michel]
\- La [Dune du Pilat]
\- Les [Ocres de Rustrel]
\- La [Mer] de [Glace]  ("ice sea) in Chamonix
\- Les Falaises d'[Étretat]
\- Les [Orgues de l'Ille sur Tet]
\- Les [Calanques] de Cassis
Les Ocres de Roussillon, aka Little Colorado
[The Carnac Megaliths Field]
Oh wow, this looks incredible
Haha same ! So we may have *met* from accross the channel by chance one day !
Computer science in France, we use Discord for almost every class except for English where we use MS Team
High school here, we use blackboards (bbcollab) for all lessons done online
I have like one online class every 3 days and then they sometimes give us busy busywork
We use Zoom and BB collab
Mine are mostly using Discord or a bad app from the university
In France we have Arnac-la-Poste, which (at least phonetically) means "Fraud-the Post"
**Montcuq** *-> Mon cul -> My ass*
It is the most known but there is plenty
"Montcuq" in France which sounds like "mon cul": my ass
Ahh in France we have the very famous Montcuq, which when pronounced means “my ass”
Not for from where I am there’s Gland (knob) then Pussy not too far either
There is a town called Rohan in France
We have the very famous Montcuq village that sounds like "mon cul" (my ass in French)
It's really known in France and there are many jokes about it
Le Fion (the ass)
Poil (hair)
Montcuq (sound like Mon cul, my ass)
Glandage (doing nothing)
Condom (do I need to explain that one)
And many many other funny villages
Not to mention Villejuif, a Paris suburb, meaning "The Jewish town"
We also have Bitche in Moselle (and the communauté de communes is called Pays de Bitche too apparently)
Let's mention Fourqueux (sound like French for "pitting dick in")
Bitche, Anus, Chatte (Pussy), Condom, Gland (Glans), La Trique (the hard on) , Le Cercueil (the coffin), Mouais ("meh"), Trécon (very stupid)
Since Brest doesn't sound like anything particular in French, I never realized until today that it did in fact sound like "breast
" Thanks
Bourg-la-reine, phonetically sounds like "fuck the queen"
Bouffémont ... Sounding like eat my ...
Brest-Litosvk right
Does trusting the Germans to not try and take over Europe as "ignoring simple safety rules" ? Because if so the policy of appeasement
There's also the [Courrières mine disaster] in 1906, a thousand people died (including children)
It was either caused by badly handled mining explosives or by the use of naked flames lamp because engineers underestimated the presence of methane in the mines
I'm atheist but I go to the Mass at funerals because it's important for the dead's family
I am full atheist, so personally, no
I have experienced death in my close family, and to me this is just the end of life
I still have these persons in my heart and mind of course and I wish they were still here, but that's life, we are born, we live and then we die
From my experience, people prefer to keep it safe when they are dealing with non-religious grievers
They would say comforting things like "She was a wonderful aunt, I will never forget her", or even fringing on spiritual like "I feel like he is still here with me", but claiming to an atheist widow that you know how many years her husband is going to spend in purgatory is rude
(Some still do though, you have cads everywhere)
You are talking about anti-theism, not atheism
Atheism is "not believing in god", not "believing in the absence of god"
They are generally exited and first question is "How it is to live in Pariiiiiis
it's my dream".
And I answear " I don't live in Paris and it would be a nightmare to me".
"Wow, really
Are you from Paris
" which will annoy every French person that isn't from Paris
"Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir" is the most common reaction I got when I was in Germany
Also, some people called me 'baguette' for a while
We have the same
France ? Hun hun hun la baguette
American/British/French schools in the Middle East teach history as it is taught in other Western countries
With that being said, you always have idiots who think Hitler is “good” because of what he did to the jews
They obviously did not know that the middle east would be his next destination if Russia would fall
Not to mention that they are also semitic people sooo
yeah
Ugh the obsession with skin color
Oh and they also often said "Nique la police" , which means fuck the police
Is there any German here that could explain me why you all know that
The countryside is cool indeed, but beware of Gégé in the woods
The food is as great as they say
Québécois are cool to me, I would like to visit, but most French know shit about Québec except the accent
We support them in their independence journey
Vive le Québec libre !
Of course I can
Just as I can say "America is a first world country".
1 millions people live in the city of Paris, and about 12
5 millions in its urban area
As of 2018, there are 67 millions French people
I have to agree that ~1/6 of the population is a lot, so it's understandable that foreigners will ask the question, even more when knowing the appeal and attractiveness Paris has
While Paris is without a doubt the most populated city, and has the most populated urban area as well (Marseille is the 2nd city with 863 310 inhabitants and has the 3rd most populated urban area with 1
5 million), most provinciaux (people who don't live in Paris) don't like Parisians
The fact that there's a word referring to everyone who's not Parisians can help explain that lol
Also most French people don't really like the capital all that much (everything can be really expensive especially housing, way too many tourists everywhere, feels crowded, Parisians live here)
But to be more serious here, it's mostly annoying because France is much more diverse than Paris
Depending on the person, regional identities can be very strong, some parts with even their own language (Britanny, Corsica, Pays-Basque) and accents (south of France, Alsace)
Don’t mess with Gégé, or Didier for that matter
Yes, indeed
The expanding territory, the many fronts and all the air, ground and maritime transportation/operation required more oil
He was advised to attack South to secure oil before heading into Russia
But, Russia was always his first ambition
Initially he did not expect France and UK to react and wanted to go West
Nope, nothing at all, unfortunately
I live in the Auvergne region of France
We had about 10-14 cm of snow on 14 November but since then nothing
Multiple forecasts of snow but nothing
In fact we have only had about three icy mornings
I live in the Northeast of France, and so far it hasn’t snowed
The temperatures were very mild until about 3 days ago when they got below freezing during the night mainly
And the area is known for harsh winters
This is terrifying
In France, I'd trust them to not be frauds and actually send the products
I would not necessarily trust the quality of their products though
Only very gullible old people would buy something from them imo
[This picture] of Charles De Gaulle in Paris after the liberation in August 1944
Jeeze, just watching the picture, I want to hug the child and tell him it's gonna be alright, we are going to find your parents
Props to the soldier
Damn his story his quite sad
I would love to live in Vatican
Seems lit
I really love Greek and Arabic !
I love Romanian and Russian
Italian and Icelandic
Turkish for me
Italian and german
Arabic and Japanese
I also like the way both of these languages are written, it's very elegant to me
Why French
Why
Met a student from Romania at uni a few weeks ago, right before this whole corona quarantine bullshit
She happened to have received a call from her family back home while we were having a.... erm
constructive discussion
and damn if romanian isn't a sexy language, I don't know what is
sounded a bit familiar (it's a romance language after all) but particularly distinct and exotic as well
But hey
finding her incredibly attractive might be playing a part, I don't know lol
Damn right but still in touch so it's ok haha
She returned to Romania for the time being
Has your country ever been ruled (outside periods of occupation by another country) by someone foreign-born
For example, the current Georgian President was born French (with Georgian origins) and was naturalized Georgian in 2004
In France, we had chief ministers of state (unofficial prime minister) who were born abroad (Cardinal Mazarin, for example, was Italian) but their power was limited, due to the absolute monarchy
Manuel Valls was naturalized French when he was 20 and was our prime minister from 2014 to 2016
Edit: by foreign-born I meant borned foreigners, not citizen of your country
I'm sorry I wasn't very clear
I mean, you didn't name the most obvious one for France which was Henri IV, one of our most famous kings
He was from Navarre and he was a protestant, and had to convert to catholicism to access to the throne, leading to a famous bon mot: "Paris vaut bien une messe" (Paris is well worth a mass)
To add to the OP, we also have a number of French citizens born abroad who ruled France: Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, former president who died recently, was born in Coblenz in Germany
Paul Deschanel, a IIIrd Republic President, was born in Belgium
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was born in Izmir in Turkey
Also, we've had a number of recent candidates for the Presidential Election born abroad: Eva Joly (ecologist) is Norwegian, Jean-Luc Mélenchon (radical left) was born in Tangiers, today in Morocco and then an International Zone, and Jacques Cheminade (small candidate, kinda loony) was born in Buenos Aires and has dual French-Argentinian citizenship
Henry IV of France was born in the Kingdom of Navarre and crown King Henry III of Navarre first
He acquired the French crown as a direct descendant of Louis IX
As a near miss : Napoléon is born three months after Corsica was annexed
Back then it was an independant republic for 14-15ish years and before it was part of the Republic of Genoa
We tried to import Queen from Austria and we didn’t like that
What is wrong with you, Austria
José I was born in the Corsican Republic
(Ok it was annexed by France when he was 1 year old but it technically counts)
I was about to write about Bernadotte
Quite an interesting story to read about
>	Felipe V duke of Anjou was indeed French
And now, Louis, Duke of Anjou, is Spanish and pretender to the throne of France as Louis XX
I always forget why the King of Spain and the legitimate pretender to the crown of France are not the same, but I suppose it has something to do with Salic law and Franco's intervention
VGE, Deschanel and Balladur weren't born foreigners
Henry IV was
Aren't the Seljuks a foreign dynasty to begin with ? They don't come from Anatolia, do they ? (Manzikert wouldn't make much sense if they were i guess ?)
And before the Seljuks wasn't it the Byzantine Empire ? Constantin I was born in modern Serbia, and I would bet a bunch of other emperors were not locals (at least I would expect the first ones to be roman aristocrats)
If by "fun" you mean "incorrect", sure
Granted, Corsica had been French for all of three months when Napoléon was born, but still
Napoléon was born a few months after the annexation of Corsica
I wasn't talking about born foreigner, just born abroad
French legitimists think treaty of Utrecht is not valid
Juan Carlos is 5th in the succession order for them
I think even Felipe V told that he would claim throne of France if Louis XV died without heirs (but maybe he would have resign from his throne in Spain)
Ah you must have written it before OP's edit then
Maybe yeah, not sure what he meant
Any conqueror would fit "born foreigners" I suppose
:-/
Wouldn't that only exclude people who become American later in life, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
I imagine a child born in Europe with 2 US citizens as parents would still be recognized as American from birth
Quick Googling told me this:
>A person born abroad in wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother and a U.S. citizen father acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under section 301(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), if at least one of the parents resided in the United States or one of its outlying possessions prior to the person's birth
Nope, just wanted to add which French leaders were born abroad
I guess Delanoë is born in Tunisia, though he is retired
Actually there’s a theory that consciousness and language are tightly connected, but it’s hard to articulate and those are just suppositions
Yeah I spent a semester there for Erasmus, I quite enjoyed it
It was a long time ago but I remember there was some kind of free music festival, i went to some concerts and plenty of bars, so not so boring
Yes
Epiphany, we eat Galette des rois
But it's not a holiday
Yes we do, we call it "épiphanie", and  we eat a cake called "galette des rois" to celebrate the arrival of the 3 kings before Jesus Christ
My mom wait for epiphany to put the three rois mages (biblical magi) in her nativity scene
Some Christians do that to
Everyone (with family and sometimes at work) eat a cake called galette des rois
In some parts of France it is called gâteau des rois ou brioche des rois
I even have a piece of [king cake from 1871] at home
It is a souvenir from the siege of Paris by the Prussians in 1870-1871
I know, it’s weird
We call it Epiphanie and we eat a kind of pie with a surprise in it
We call the "pie" a "[galette des rois] the king's galette
(even in south of France they have [brioche] instead)
Inside there is a paste made with almond, the *frangipane*  and hidden in the paste, we have a [fève] *,* wich is a small figurine
The one who find the *fève* in his part become the king/queen and can chose a king/queen too
If you buy (that's what most people do) the *galette or the brioche*, it come with a golden paper crown
In private school kids would make their [own crown]
Many people collects those fève and it's traditionnaly small people reprensenting old fashioned jobs or [regional costumes] but you can have moderne one like [harry potter] disney or simpsons fève .
If there are children, the youngest one goes under the table and the person who cut the pie says "who's this one for
" and the kids say "oncle, daddy etc
" so it's more fair but it's also a great way for the aduts to have a look inside the pie and make sure the kid have the fève and the crown
I didn't even know today was supposed to be a special day of some kind
Yup
Here it's called Épiphanie and it's the day we eat the "Galette des Rois"
Same for us "épiphanie" where we eat the kings cake
But it's not a holiday, just a tradition
I would have called it a pie too but now you're making le doubt
Just look up "galette des rois", and be sure sure to choose the recipe with frangipane, as in southern France it is a different cake than in the North (brioche with candied fruits)
OHHH
Fuck I totally forgot this existed and was now, I thought it was way later in the year
Yeah it's kinda celebrated but it's not a holiday
Bien sûr que si que c'est largement célébré
Ah thanks, today I learned
I guess the king cake and galette des rois had the same origin and then everybody let their creativity go wild
What always weirded me out was the obviously artificial colours used for the cake
I mean, how did they make it back then
Great article, thanks
What I am going to describe hasn't really been valid this year because all the headlines have been about COVID no matter the season, but on normal years you will always get:
- Headlines about cold weather and snow in winter, complete with a long form interview with some random person who forgot to put his snow tires on and can't go to the store
- You guessed it, headlines about hot weather in summer, sometimes but not always linked to stories about global warming, but without fail, featuring some random person who decided to install /aircon/a swimming pool/an ice house/all of the above/ in their house
- The national high school exams are often considered prime exciting news, even though they always happen at the same time and in the same manner
- Same thing with the end of the summer break, you will be treated to parents shopping for backpacks and complaints about the latest education reform to fill the void
- The main TV news program often features thinly disguised ads for seasonal holiday destinations (beach towns in summer, ski stations in winter)
- Speaking about holidays, let's talk about journalist's favorite subjects when things get slow in summer: traffic jams
You will be taken to a journey on an unlikely village close to the highway who suddenly saw tens of thousands of cars come through because the highway was jammed and GPS apps told people to use secondary roads
This story lasts about two months and can be reused eternally since there are always new traffic jams to talk about
- I am probably forgetting most of them since I don't really watch that stuff anymore, but I am sure there are dozens more coming like clockwork every year
\-Dozens cars torched as "tradition" each end of year
\-How risky the new year will be for the president ( whoever he is )
Fairly good overview though
But let's not forget riots coverage in France
Everyone arguing the numbers, everyone arguing about the coverage, the people accusing the medias and the government, the medias accusing the other medias, everyone accusing everyone of accusing everyone, and so on
I remember the back to school period as well, with random people buying school supplies, random people in their house getting ready on D day, kids wanting to stay on holidays, others wanting to go back
We like having random people on French TV
There's also the 'oh it's raining' news, everytime it's raining heavily, and you guessed it, with some random people's opinions on the rain, it's flow, if they were affected by flood
(It's quite common as in the south, around Montpellier if my memories are correct, they put a lot of concrete everywhere, with the drought, when it's raining heavily, everything is flooded
Happens at least twice a year
Around January we'd also get daily updates on the Paris Dakar, endless reports about the origins of the Galette des Rois (with brioches fans fighting endlessly against frangipane aficionados), snow reports from ski resorts with at least one comical fall every 3 minutes
Something about bakeries selling Galettes des rois around the epiphany (shocking news)
People skiing down their last slope before going back to their sad parisian life
This, and we have our own "the hospital is collapsing
Doctors & nurses on strike, asking for better pay & recognition" every year (not especially January, flu season rather)
Conservative journalists saying France is doing worse than Germany because policies are too generous
My opinion on them is they are ~~merely~~ figuratively nostalgic of nazi occupation, fantasizing German efficiency and vowing a cult to "strong leaders", pure neocon imo
Haha, we do this with cigarettes
>Everyone arguing the numbers,
"9000 participants in the protests according to the police, 75000 according to the organizers"
Hardly surprising, with their inventive way of counting:
We have them all but I think the petition because some exam was too hard is a more recent phenomenon
Rarely have I read such bullshit
Typical uninformed left-wing criticism of the supposedly non-existent German welfare state, compared to the oh so generous French social state
Your preposterous amalgamation of Germanophile right-wingers with neonazis aside, your analysis of the German welfare state is outdated
It is certainly not the most generous in the world nor in Europe, but it is probably on-par if not even more efficient than France’s. Especially in healthcare
Which also explains why right-wingers and left-wingers like to refer to the German model
For different reasons, of course, but the idea that Germany got rid of the welfare state is just uninformed
The countless debates around the 'media's numbers', countless arguments around who wants to diminish the numbers and what
Mec, that's my point
They believe France should do less social, because they fantasize Germany does less social
And you cannot say these journalists are Germanophile, they're drooling over their fantasies of an hard-working and obedient society that France isn't and Germany is (in their minds)
I never spoke about neonazis, i spoke of neocon, and of occupation, and my point was about occupation, not about nazism (i did not intend to speak about that, those journalist dont speak about it)
And "Germany got rid of the welfare", did i say that ? Nooope, i did not, and am fairly aware they (to sum it up) downgraded it under Schroeder then upgraded it back under Merkel when they could afford it
My point is i believe journalists like Pascal Praud dont want to acknowledge that, they prefer to push forward their political agenda of getting rid of welfare state over the lie that Germany is successful because it does not do welfare state
"Exilé au milieu des nuées,
Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher"
L'Albatros by Charles Baudelaire, in which the poet is depicted as an albatross, struggling to relate to Mankind and to feel adequate among humans
(Exiled among the thick clouds (mankind, reality) / Its wings more fitted for a giant prevents it from walking)
"Demain dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne,
Je partirai
Demain dès l'aube by Victor Hugo, in which the poet talks to someone about a long trip he's making, to see their grave
It was written in memory of his daughter who drowned
(Tomorrow starting at dawn, at the time where fields become white (because of the morning light) / I'll leave)
Fun fact: I study German and those are the two I was taught in highschool
I learned the whole poem because I liked it, & the first few lines of the Faust because I had to (still liked it)
So you can probably say that those are also the most well-known outside of your country
It's always set in Paris, in the pretty touristic spots with a lovely weather, so not really
I can't think of one as of now
I learned about Bruges in Yoko Tsuno (the comics), and have dreamed to visit ever since
Learning that it’s a tourist trap was both logical and a disappointment, haha :) I’ll visit anyway, I’m a tourist after all
Spider man - Homecoming was a nightmare to watch
Less than five minutes in the Netherlands, about 100% cliché (though not those on drugs & prostitutes)
And I’m saying that as a French, so I can’t imagine what it was like as a Dutch
It's one of my favorite movies
This
The same is true for France, which is often 1
just Paris, 2
super romantic in foreign movies
And the Emilia (is that the name
) series that’s currently _the_ thing in the USA, it seems
man, that’s a nightmare
Awful, not at all representative
It's such a shame
There is so much that could be done to make a cool movie set in switzerland
Without evil bank or nazi gold involved
Haha, my bad
Don't forget to say Hello, Thank You and Goodbye in stores, with a little smile
Doesn't need to be in French, even in English or your native language, that is just a basic untold rule here, and quite probably the reason why you find people in service rude in France
kill someone
Expect train to arrive in time
Your worst nightmare would be a clown
Fine then, we wont
But you know, we've got all these guillotines gathering dust in our prisons, it would be a shame not to use them
just say the word and we can lend them to you for a lil revolution or two
>How is IKEA viewed in your country, if you have one
If you have one what, IKEA or country
Cheap, functionnal, not too bad design wise, but quality is crap
buying *new* ikea furniture is a luxury for sure (okay, not really, but i wouldn't call it cheap either), the budget option is to buy one of the thousands of identical ikea desks/tables/bookshelves that are for sale for dirt cheap on whatever your local craigslist equivalent is
Even here where the average income it's pretty good I view it as expensive, I mean every time you go here to buy a few things you have a €1000 hole in your wallet
Sure, 150€ isn't much, but because of how many of them end up on reseller sites, it'll cost you 15€ to get it used
I dunno man, maybe I'm a huge cheapskate, but I just don't see the point of buying new under these circumstances
Well, still waiting for you and the Danes to get really serious about Skåne ! It's brewing, but we dont see shit ! C'mon guys, show us the Vikingness in your blood and go raid and claim that bloody land once and for all !
**/s**    (just in case someone takes me seriously)
Ah, banter, the best way to insult with honesty removed
During the Cold War, I can see why it was a thing
Now, it seems making less sense
I would like Europe to defend itself
Say, if Poland and the Baltic States need support, I would prefer Europeans troops, and European gear
I think they are an obstacle in the way of a credible European defence system
This must be one of the subject where the answers mostly vary in function of the nationality of those who say it !
Be it here or IRL, I don't know a single polish guy that is against them and a single french guy in favour of them
That being said, for Europe as a whole, I don't know
That doesn't matter to us a lot and I'm obviously against them in my own country (The russian threat is nearly non-existent in France, to be brutally honest
But I can understand why some countries would prefer the US to an exclusively european alternative in the current situation
I mean, my country maybe has the most credible armed force in the EU (certainly once the UK leaves)
But it still is far away from Russia and we clearly do not have the same projection capacities of the USA
Our track record as an ally is not stellar either
And, again,  the french don't really care about Russia
Most are either indifferent toward the current policy or want appeasement, very rare are those in favour of a more hostile stance toward Russia
In this context, I feel like in the case the US end their involvement in Europe, France would be put in the rather uncomfortable position of protecting a very large part of the whole EU border for a period of transition before a credibly EU army is formed
And I don't think It would be politically tenable here to do this without asking for sizable political and/or monetary compensations from the EU members that benefit the most from it
And as I understood from my various conversations, such compensations are out of question and the status quo is nearly unanimously considered as prefferable if it's possible to maintain
I think the issue is fundamentally that there are no real feelings of kinship between people inside the union
I think It's fair to say that the French are very foreign to Estonians, Latvians or Poles
And I'm quite confident the opposite is also vey true
In this context, I can't really blame nations to act egoistically and to choose the most cost-efficient option
And it would be outright dishonest to imply US involvement is not the most cost-efficient
Till there is a real feeling of kinship between europeans, I feel like the idea of a completely independent EU-wide defense force would most definitely have to be forced on us
That being said, I feel the bases in Netherlands, Belgium and Italy have had their time and no longer serve any real purpose for europeans
Instead, the countries who really wish to have more insurance against Russia (Baltics and Poland mostly) should get them instead
There is nothing to think about when you're a voluntary carpet for American's boots
Tout à fait
Et avant même une armée il faudrait commencer par acheter du matériel militaire européen plutôt qu'américain
Oh gotcha, so "y'all" are in Europe out of pure kindness, it's obvious now
Thank you for opening my eyes kind overlords
Va dire ça aux Belges, aux Néerlandais, aux Polonais et j'en passe
C'est bien eux que je vise
Ils font moins cas des 40 000 GI parce qu'ils ont connu une occupation soviétique assez récemment, et que globalement la région qu'ils ont occupé a encore un très gros retard sur les autres 30 ans plus tard
C'est un peu pareil que leur peur du nucléaire qui parait étrange de ce côté du Rhin, qui s'explique aussi principalement par la Guerre Froide et leur rôle en temps que champ de bataille
Des deux maux, ils (comprendre : Le gouvernment
La population est plus divisée sur la question de ce que j'ai pu comprendre) préfèrent ne pas s'éloigner des US qui n'ont pas été des "occupants" particulièrement dérangeants dans les 70 années qui ont précédé (en tout cas en Europe, incontestablement) afin de constituer une menace crédible face à la Russie sans avoir à en assumer réellement les coûts
Il faut bien avouer qu'une armée européenne, pour être crédible, demanderait un gros budget que l'immense majorité des pays dont on parle n'est pas prêt à assumer actuellement
Il faut avouer qu'un effet secondaire de cette aide américaine est que ces pays peuvent se permettre d'avoir un budget défense assez faible, autant d'argent que l'état peut dépenser dans des projets qui sont visiblement plus utiles pour la population et/ou réduire le déficit (plutôt ce qui arrive dans les faits)
Là où par exemple, la Suède (non membre de l'OTAN) a rétabli la conscription obligatoire suite à l'occupation de la Crimée.
Je dirais que si tu es plutôt habitué à la perspective FR sur la question et que celle des autres européens (principalement allemands) te surprend, je dirais que c'est parce que globalement la France diffère de beaucoup de pays d'Europe parce que les gens ici ont BEAUCOUP moins peur de la Russie que la plupart des pays d'Europe*.
C'est d'autant plus marqué parmi ceux qui s'intéressent à la politique puisqu'en France ils sont même généralement plutôt en faveur d'une politique d'apaisement/neutralité face à la Russie
En 2017, un politicien de premier plan en France a évoqué la possibilité d'une négociation avec la Russie sur la question des conflits non résolus aux frontières
Et très franchement pas grand monde en a parlé à l'époque, encore une fois tout le monde s'en tape
Je peux t'assurer avec une quasi-certitude qu'il est clair que ça serait un suicide électoral dans l'immense majorité de la population dans les pays qui sont très représentés ici et encore plus sur r/europe (où il y a beaucoup d'utilisateurs d'Europe de l'Est)
PS : De plus, les pays qui ont vraiment peur de la Russie ont plutôt tendance à être sur la pente montante, tandis que ceux qui s'en foutent un peu perdent en importance à cause de performances économiques au mieux médiocres
Donc je pense que le status quo n'est pas prêt de bouger
Clairement, il n'y aura pas d'armée européenne avant que les allemands n'emboîtent le pas aux français
Avant cela il ne se passera rien
Chocolate, all the best ones are made in Europe (though I have never tasted Ecuadorian chocolate, this one has also a good reputation)
obviously cheese and bread
But a case could be made for the large majority of foods due to european laws on food quality
Best baguette I’ve ever had in my life was in
Costa Rica
And then Spain
Not sure if I’m just getting lucky (or unlucky
) or what
I'm too ashamed to tell that irl, but my favorite fromage is italian : the gorgonzola
I somewhat agree
Desserts from the Maghreb are insane
> Austrian and German cheese is competitive
German cheese is not heavily marketed for exports and Austrian cheese is exported here, but not a lot to other countries
Some are nice but they're not super diverse, not very strong
There is a law here where restaurants can't refuse you a glass of tap water
Even if you don't eat
And when you take tap water with your lunch, it will always be free
They have nothing in common
I wish I could tell you more but I've had them once or twice a long time ago but I remember being amazed by them
There were flavours that I wasn't familiar with at all but that I enjoyed a lot
Yeah, to be fair it's an extremely low bar, considering how the vast majority of Europeans can't handle spice
Yeah perhaps I wasn't clear enough, I was agreeing with your fellow brit and talking about how the rest of Europe can't handle it
There is one shop here in Lyon where I buy stuff from time to time
It’s a Russian shop though, but they offer a lot of Polish stuff too like Krakowska, frozen pierogis or twaróg (so I can make my own pierogis, waaaaay better than frozen
They have many other “treats” too, for me it is the stuff I was used to eating while on holidays in Poland
Can't say I've ever seen one
Poles have assimilated
In France, none, or maybe some few
But if there is a "Polish" grocery store, it probably sell more things that have nothing to do with Poland
And no, you can't buy Polish specialties (unless I've never heard of them, I don't even know their specialties)
I'm in a big city in the South of France, and while we do not have strictly speaking Polish groceries, we do have Russian groceries that also have Polish (and other Eastern Europe countries) items, due to the fact that we have a big Russian-Armenian diaspora in town
It's not a country anymore, but I've always been fascinated by their history: the Roman republic, then empire, and its continuity in what've been called the Byzantine empire, and also its legacy in most of european countries which still exist today: it's amazing that so many country did claim themselves of the Roman empire
More than 2 millenia of continued administration and influence by the Roman, their history is so rich, diverse, and everyone in the world is or has been influenced by the roman civilization, it's fascinating
Germany
Besides the world wars, I realized I didn't really know much about the country, and its history is quite interesting
Also I'm learning German and it's quite helpful to know more about Germany (cultural context, jokes and references)
The Roman Empire
Korea, weird little piece of land stuck between giant China and agressive Japan
Add to this a language that is prety much isolated is the region and a religion where erudition=power and you're in for a weird mix
Mesoamerica and South Korea and my picks
Both have such fascinating history
Check out Peter Frankopan's [Silk Roads] if you haven't already
A true madlad
1870
And maybe tell a certain someone that no, he's not ready for war with Prussia and he should hire better tacticians
Telling Louis XVI he has to reform real quick or giving the Wikipedia Waterloo page to Napoleon before the battle starts
A week would be far from enough for France but I guess during 1789 in Paris for the Revolution, or maybe 1870 during La Commune de Paris, or maybe sometimes during le Siècle des Lumières, or maybe sometimes during the Grand Conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, or maybe sometimes during the First Crusade
February 1848, the french Revolution for the 2nd republic
If it was guaranteed that I could not be killed I would love to see the siege of Alesia during the Gallic Wars
Or 1871, see the Commune of Paris
Maybe you mean the early web
The early internet was mostly email, ftp, rsh/rcp, then usenet and then gopher
The early web was (for me) very exciting
A page listed all the new http servers and another page gave awards for the best ones
I was awarded a best 25% of the web in 94 or 95
Exciting times
Yes that was my thought too
Actually Louis XVI wanted to reform, thing is he lost the minister Vergennes few days before the assembly starts and he was one of his best and smart advisor
So when the things went out of control he had the choice between  calling the troops or letting the Parisians taking over and when the latter came to Versailles asking the king to send away the armies camping near Paris he accepted because he wanted to avoid any civil war or bloodbath ( the two previous centuries showed how the monarchy struggled with the civil wars )
And one of his biggest mistake is to call back the Parliaments after Louis XV and his minister Maupeou banished them few decades earlier and made the justice free because they were contesting the monarchy and access to courts of justice by common people was expensive
Sadly Louis XV rule is not very teached despite it was the positive peak of the absolute monarchy
Louis XVI biggest weakness was his lack of good advisors in the end
I can huuuuum along the USAian, German, English, and the best of all the Russian one ( I find la Marseillaise pretty epic, but, the USSR one is one rank above)
I know it's not an official one but "O flower of Scotland" is beautiful and I love to hear it
And the Brits get a lot of shit for "Goooood saaaaave zeeeeee queeeeeen" but they have "Land of Hope and Glory"... Why don't they use that one
The old East German anthem is so fucking cool
I just watched the video, it's disappointing on the French side haha
I could definitely hum it, but I only know the first two sentences of the first verse (Über alles)
I don't.
Yes they were more talented at national anthems than at managing a state hahaha
I didn't even know that
Pretty much the  same
It’s generally seen as tasteless and crass
I suppose it depends what you call showing off wealth though
It’s okey to own nice things and all but bragging about money is seen as crass
You already know how the wealthy flex in the US
The richer the "better" and the "you ain't shit unless you're flexin'" mindset is strong
It depends how you show wealth though
Expensive things are okay if they are perceived as simple and "elegant".  They're not if they're loud and very visible
So my guess would be wearing [this watch] is ok, but definitely not [that one] even though the gold rolex costs half the price of the patek

Here in France it's Plus Belle La Vie (A Brighter Life), it takes place in Marseille and tell the tales of people (idk very much i've never watched it)
>it takes place in Marseille and tell the tales of people
j'aime beaucoup cette description
Only 17 seasons and 4600+ episodes but it has only been going on since 2004
I tried watching it with a few friends during lockdown and it was surprisingly not so bad
Definitely had a good time
Les Feux de l'Amour ont 48 saisons et douze mille épisodes et c'est pas fini
Demande à tes (grand-)parents pour un résumé, ça passe depuis la fin des années 80
J'ai fait du mieux que j'ai pu
Si t'as passé un bon moment alors c'est une bonne série
Ma foi
En soi c'était pas non plus un grnad moment mais avec des potes et une bière, c'était sympa
Some african accents are just too hard to understand
I really have troubles with thick accents from Northern France, and also with Paris subburbean popular accent youngsters have
Well their accent and their slang, it is a deadly combo
Accent from Marseille, in the south, is pretty unintelligible for me
Almost every quite strong accent, especially when Texans are trying to speak french
It’a really close to the south alsacian dialect
I spent quit some time in Vorarlberg and it was easier to me to speak in alsacian than to speak German to make me understood
And people from the Pyrenees
(Jean Lasalle for exemple
As the other guy said as we have a lot of immigrants yes we get to here a lot of accents in our country
I have no problem with the accents from overseas, they are very understandable, more than quebecois
But they are some people that spoke french as their first language and comes from somewhere in Africa that I struggle a lot to understand
How often does it snow in your country ?
Here in north-eastern France, it used to snow quite a lot from January to March, but it's been a few years that it hasn't really snowed
T'habites où en northeastern France ? Pour voir si on a la même météo
Well there's a mix between global warming and colding because I hate the fact that we have 5°C every morning while 2 weeks ago there was still 35°C that's absolutely incomprehensible
En Lorraine
Les Vosges ?
Non, en Moselle
Roh dommage :/
Pour une fois que j'aurais pu trouver un copain vosgien
In France tattoos and piercings, apart from the basic piercings for earrings, are generally frowned upon
They're probably more accepted now, but only by a small margin
They're not accepted in law firms though
If you wore one, people would comment behind your back
Space in between thousands, commas for decimals
1 235 678,45
In France, both
69 420,62€
69420,62€
are correct
We use commas as decimal separators and narrow no-break spaces as thousands separators, although people just type a simple space and usually the software (depends which one) will automatically replace it with the correct space
We also count like that, they sure need to be introduced milliards
Here we write 1,55 €
Same in France
Same here uwu
Oh you lucky I wish I had ´ on my keyboard and the fact that German has no accute accent but still has the key angers me
We have fricking "~" that we don't use in french but we still don't have a god damn acute dead key
Thé prõblëm îs thât wê hàvè äll ãççënts bùt thìs òñe
The "~" is used in breton, basque (not 100% sure about that one) and in math
So it is used
Not much but still
They're the norm now
I mean, most people are officially Catholic but actual believers are now less common than atheists
Especially in younger generations
As perfectly normal
34% are agnostic and 29% are atheist
So 63% of the population is irreligious
And we've had a very strict separation of state and religion since 1904, with our "laïcité" principle
If I'm not wrong, France is one of the most atheist country
Nobody really cares, excepted really religious person
There is another word people who hate religions and make that clear
It's antitheist
It’s stopped now (I think) but when Emmanuel Macron was elected there were a lot of jokes about the age difference between him and his wife (she’s 20+ years older than he is)
Macron's Wife used to be his french teacher
Macron vowed to be a "Jupiterian President". So, many of his detractors like to literally call him Jupiter to mock him
The guy has made many condescending and ignorant comments that did not help his case with that nickname
To many he comes off as arrogant and disconnected from reality, exactly like someone who sees himself as a God-President
Just to give a few examples of his numerous "dérapages" (slips) ;
He called the French people one of "Disobedient and refractory gauls".
He said that many of the workers from a specific plant he was visiting were "illiterate".
He bragged to a random guy about how he "earned his nice suit" and explained to him how "one just has to work for it"
He opposed those who succeed to "those who are nothing" etc
Absolutely anything that he does
Long life to Carl XVI Gustaf !
Sad that their age difference is not laughed at anymore ?
Why would you find this sad ?  I, on the contrary, am very happy that the joking has stopped : when you see a man with a much younger woman, nobody makes jokes about that
He met his wife when he was 15 and she was 39
This is fucked up, no matter which way you look at it
Probably used to be a typo and 6edfIsh corrected themselves
Oh, I’d misunderstood you
Yes, I agree with you, of course
Let them be
Who cares about their age
What matters is how competent he is as a politician,  not his private life !
Probably
But I wouldn’t accuse people without proof either
From what I remember reading in the papers there was nothing improper between them at the time
They met when he was 15 but got in a relationship when he was 16
>En mai 1993, dans l'atelier de théâtre qu'elle anime au lycée de la Providence, elle remarque Emmanuel Macron, alors âgé de quinze ans et élève de seconde dans la même classe que sa fille Laurence
>**L'année suivante**, le couple commence une relation
La différence d'âge (de plus de 24 années) entre les deux amants provoque un scandale dans la famille Trogneux : leur relation tombe sous le coup de la **loi du 23 décembre 1980 et du délit d'atteinte sexuelle sur mineur, qui dispose qu’un enseignant qui a des relations sexuelles avec un élève mineur âgé de plus de quinze ans encourt jusqu’à trois ans de prison**. Leur relation se poursuit discrètement à Paris, où Emmanuel Macron entre en classe de terminale, puis en classes préparatoires littéraires au lycée Henri-IV
And yet she didn’t lose her job nor was she prosecuted
Maybe she should have been or not, your guess is as good as mine
We don’t know the facts, and besides, it’s none of our business
One piece of advice : don’t believe everything you read in Wikipedia as gospel
Subject closed
This is old news anyway, and I’m beginning to feel as bored about it as our British friends are feeling about Megxit !
Oh I don't really care neither about it
I'm not the kind of person that will always put that on the table to criticize Macron, that's just stupid
I just answered to your "there was nothing improper between them at the time" because it seemed to me that it was incorrect
With an s sound
I don't think I've ever heard someone go with an -sh sound in French
With an "s", no reason to pronounce it differently here
Yes, people having knowledge and respect for other cultures, what wankers
I would argue on the difficulty of pronouncing "zs" for non native speakers compared to the 's' as we have in Latin languages or anglo-saxon
I have a hungarian friend named "Zsófia" and the "zs" is, from my understanding, somewhere in between 's', 'sh' with a bit of 'j'. I'm not certain I can still pronounce it properly
Edit: add forgotten accent in the name
Tu te compliques beaucoup trop la vie, c'est le même son que le j dans bonjour :)
Ah merde, si j'avais su
I lived 15 years in Réunion Island, when people go to France they say it like that, as if Réunion is not part of France
In the local journal 3/5 are on local news 1/5 on national, and the rest on sport
Being born on the island comes with a real identity another language derived from French (and french), another cuisine, unique music, others tradition and culture (the island is really multicultural) etc
So I feel that most réunionnais will see themselves as their ethnicity, réunionnais then French
For the EU, it's considered as a poor territory where investment are necessary
And man they really invest : if there is a new infrastructure most of the time the EU was part of it
It's more of a general issue with the EU but people don't understand it, it seems like there is a robot printing and giving money and not real people coming
So people are grateful I guess but don't feel part of thf EU
Also most of réunionnais don't speak English so is hard to feel connected with other nationality and the EU when you don't have access to it
For your last question about relatives : there is a lack of interesting jobs in la Réunion so most reunionnais do have relatives in France
Yes, France bought the island from the Knight Hospitallers and then trade it to Sweden for some warehouses in Götheburg (no idea how it is written)
Swede renamed Le Carénage into Gustavia
But almost a century later Sweden gave it back after a referendum among the locals
Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin
Then go conquer the world
- Japanese because I like stuff from Japan and I like it's culture in general
- Russian because idk sounds really cool
- and Armenian because I have some Armenian origins and kinda wants to learn it
German, Japanese, and Cantonese
The first two are spoken in some of my favorite countries on the planet, and the third would be a way for me to reconnect with my roots (and have conversations at my favorite bakeries/restaurants in Chinatown
Russian, Arabic and Mandarin
Being able to access resources in those languages seems super important to understand the major non western powers, and generally stuff that doesn't derive from a culture that's similar to mine
Also, that'd allow me to get much closer to other languages of the same families, so I'll be able to quickly learn polish and Maltese at last :)
Turkish, Russian and Arabic because I like how they sounds and the culture/history
I speak English quite well so I won't pick it and French is my native language
I would say German, Mandarin and Russian or Hindi or Greek, or even an ancient language
I love these languages and they're difficult so I would save a lot of learning time
\- Mandarin because I feel like it's an elegant language
\- Russian because I just like how it sounds
\- Icelandic because I love this country and it seems to me they sounds more "nordic" than the others  Scandinavians languages
I agree
I'm learning English since 6-7 years at school
I made little progress for 4 years (6th-9th grade), I could undertand 20% of the language
And then I became more interested in English and started to watch/read English things on my own and I made a huge progress in 2-3 years (10th-12th grade)
Now I understand 95% of the language
So yes, for anyone learning, don't give up !
English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic and
Oh right thanks
That seems obvious now considering the members of the UN Security Council lol
That was a great read, especially as a lager lover
Cheers
Nationale police and Gendarmerie ( military police doing police mission as well ) are armed and since the terrorist attacks few years ago you can see them patrolling with rifles in cities
Beside each cities have their own little police force ( police municipale ) and they can allow their officers to be armed or not, it mostly depends of the elected mayor
Also in french cities you have soldiers patrolling as well since we are still under terrorist alert, they have all rifles but they can't do anything without orders
For exemple when there were the Bataclan attack four years ago, there was soldiers next to the site but they just waited orders outside before going in meanwhile 2 policemen asked them to at least give them their rifles so they can go in, but they declined because orders
So the policemen went into the building with their pistols against terrorist with rifles, they managed to kill one and then went out with survivors
There was a huge scandal about that because if the soldiers would have been allowed to go in maybe more lifes could have been saved
Instead terrorist were executing their hostages by time passing while the special police forces were deployed hours laters
They're just patrolling to make people feel safer and supposedly to deter terrorists
That's about all they do
They are always communicating with the chain of command, via radio or even cellphones sometimes
The issue here isn't that they were waiting orders that never came, the issue is that orders were given to NOT go inside
Probably the [military police] The [nationale police] has G36 but I don't think they ever had Famas
The [military patrols] have always a camo uniform
They do have radios
And they intervened at multiple occasions but mostly because they were the ones attacked
Example :
They were right about the Bataclan attack
They received the order to engage the terrorists if they went outside though, but not to intervene inside
Slightly
Those soldiers are military and can come from different corps, including légionnaires
So it makes sense to have them strictly follow orders and take no initiative
In the case of the Bataclan attack it’s more a misconception from uneducated (on the subject) people
Hostages situations are a very shitty mess and there’s a reason for it being GIGN / Raid / BRI (or spec ops, as we’re talking about military) stuff
But excepted that it doesn’t erase the many criticism against Operation Sentinelle, especially among the military (mainly the cost for a discussed efficiency and the massive weight it represents for the logistics / troops)
Six continents: Africa, America, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, Oceania
I later on learned that technically speaking (for geographers) Asia & Europe are one continent, as they’re not separated by an ocean
Here in France, I was taught that there are 6 continents:
\- Europe
\- Asia
\- America (we did not separate North America from South America which are regional distinctions but our teachers were always careful to remind us that the term "America" when referring to the USA is contentious
\- Africa
\- Antarctica
\- Oceania (we never called it "Australia" which is always used to refer to the country
It could be because France possesses overseas territories in Oceania so this continent is often talked about
America is a single continent, Oceania is another including teritories from New guinea to french Polynesia
Same in France
Same over here
There is technically no more link between Europe-Asia and Africa, because of the Suez pass
I don’t know what geographers make of it, though
Shit, our cities have been designed around cars and public transportation
Bicycle lanes have been painted to the detriment of traffic lanes, without providing secure bicycle parking
The result
More traffic jams and the usual theft of bikes
And some places are quite dangerous, trucks can't always control their blind spots in one ways
In the Paris region a lot of money is invested in public transportation, their exceptional density (One station every 200m in Paris) makes it possible to do without bicycles anyway
Future lines extensions will help to relieve congestion in the heavily loaded segments
In Bordeaux (south-west of France) I can't complain, we have a bike lane everywhere, and a bike highway that directly go to the ocean, if you have a bus subscription, you can use closed bike shelters, and we've got 100€ from the government and the city to help repair a bike
Nice question : they recently added cycling roads everywhere in my city a'd now the car traffic is an absolute nightmare, clogging the entire city because of a waaay overkill biking network that very few people actually use
This was clearly done just so the higher up in Paris think of our mayor as a good guy and not actually for us
Lol France does the same a lot
Just got one today so I can explain in detail
We usually meet at midday but it's more polite to come a bit late (one hour max)
Then we take the "apéro" which is just a lot of alcohol and salted biscuits while saying hello to everyone and "install" you
After this we have many dishes until comes the dessert and the coffee
Children go play between different dishes
We usually end between 16 and 18 hours
Then we take a walk or play some games with everyone and sometimes when people come from far, they sleep at the place and go back home one or more days after it
Family gatherings are a mess
At least 70 people, every adult get drunk at some point of the night, songs that we-all-know-by-heart-but-pretend-we-don't play after some time, delicious food and everyone ends up shouting "Les Lacs du Connemara" at least once before the break of dawn
I love it
We generally talk about the actuality, politics, our jobs, family matter etc
have a disagreement then talk again like a debate, we all speak at the same time of course  and laught a lot, then have a walk or play pétanque, if we have time cause we starts the apéro a 11:30am, stats to eat a 12:30 and finish at about 4pm
then maybe a last coffee or tea
Some time we make a pause after the cheese for the pétanque or the walk or just a chat and eat the dessert as a snack at 4pm
Kids stay for the diner but are allowed to go to play during the cheese and come back for the dessert but most like to have cheese too
Then at 5 or 6pm it' s over
For birthdays it's the same exept the dessert is a cake, we sing the song and open the gifts
No such thing as a family gathering in my family, unless someone dies
This exactly
Also, not all members of the family are always present (at least in my family’s case)
Seems rather small doesn't it
I have 15 cousins on my father's side (so with the uncles and aunts that's a lot of people), usually we just rent a place with a lot of bedrooms for the weekend and we basically talk and eat and drink from friday to sunday
Don't forget "Les démons de minuit"
It was only for a birthday but yeah it's even longer for real family gatherings
It's a French song about Ireland, well-known in France :)
The numbers in French from France are beyond stupid
60 = soixante (everywhere)
70 = septante (Belgium) = soixante dix (sixty ten) in French from France
80 = ~~octante~~ huitante (Switzerland) = quatre vingt (four twenty) in French from France
90 = nonante (Belgium) = quatre vingt dix (four twenty ten) in French from France
"Mais qu'est-ce que c'est que ça " which can be translated by " But what is this that this is that that "
Qu'est ce que c'est que ça ?
What is this that this is that that ?
What is This ?
" Les cuisiniers excellent à faire ce mets excellent
""The cooks are good at making this excellent dish"
Not only "excellent" is not pronounced the same way in the two apparition of the word (the first one is silent on the "nt"), "mets" (dish) have a "S" in his singular form, while it's a common rule for french words to take a "S" on their plurarl nouns only
This is one exception
Why ? I don't know
Swiss (from Valais, Vaud or Fribourg) say "huitante" not "octante". Source: I lived in Lausanne for quite some years
Interesting, didn't know that
Apparently octante is no longer said, I updated my comment accordingly

Since they aren't necessarily called the same in other languages, it took me a minute to figure out a good half of the list, but ok I got them all, that's reassuring
I'd add one of the philosophes des lumières, probably Voltaire, since most of us had to read Candide/Zadig in school
Also we had a lot of history about Clovis, Charlemagne (sorry for the Germans), Henry IV (or at least l'édit de Nantes) and François the first so some of them are probably remembered by most of us
Also Molière, Saint Exupery and Jean Moulin
Charles Monet ? Don't you mean Claude ?
I don't think *everybody* knows about Debussy
I'd even say many people don't know Baudelaire or Monet either
Marie Curie, Georges Clemenceau, Jean de la Fontaine, Jules Verne, Jean Jaurès, Alexandre Dumas, Vercingétorix are pretty famous and celebrated, more than Debussy or Monet I would say
Descartes and Rousseau were already said I think
Joyeux jour de gâteau !
I don't see an issue that Charlemagne is mentioned for multiple countries, as his empire contained multiple of nowadays countries and as he was counted as a French king and a German emperor by his sons
I'm surprised there aren't more painters, like Vermeer, Bosch, Rubens, Bruegel
Edit: sorry I confused with Flemish painters in the end, as their place of birth was sometimes in modern Netherlands
Doesn't Ann Frank count as well ?
Not sure Marc Dutrou deserved his place between all those men (there's a definite lack of women in this whole thread)
I mean, *yes* he's famous, but does he deserves to be listed
I'm not quite sure
Of course
Yeah, there is so much famous french people that everyone knows about !
Oh it's just I did not think about him at the moment I answered the post ! But for sure, Robespierre belongs there
Do French people know that much about Robespierre in particular
The Revolution period is so intense to learn, a lot of names pop up and we have to cram them all until the next exam, but after the exam
Corrected ! Thank you, I was a bit distracted
And that's sad
I'd say monet is well know because we had to study in school (but tbf I can't say for sure if everyone studied it)
Marie Curie wasn't french before living in France
Yeah but you're going to summon the Polish nationalist keyboard army if you mention Marie Curie received a French nationality along her way or if you forget her maiden name
Thank you for adding some content :)
I put him in because someone mentionned Hitler for the German or Austrian answer
The question here is : which historical figure do everyone in your country knows about
Like it or not but this son of a bitch is sadly part of Belgium history :( For sœur Sourire : I am actually talking about Sœur Emmanuelle who was a belgium nonne who was cannonised by the Pope
Also, Marie-Antoinette
I would say he's the most famous person strictly associated to the French revolution
De rien :)
So what
She got French nationality
Were Clovis and Charlemagne born French
She was also Polish (although there was no Poland anymore at her time) but in France she is recognized as a French woman
The cases are different though
Chopin has a French father, but has widely told to be Polish and he was considered as such by himself and the people of his time
He was considered the national Polish composer
You're too late
I never knew her maiden name, so no way to forget it
But overall, we do consider her as French and Polish, and as a national figure (just looking on Google her name brings so much programs and official pages)
But I understand they're pissed when she's sometimes mentioned as just French, while she made great effort to keep links with Poland, recreate an independent country with WW1, taught Polish to her children, was poorly treated in the French press (breaking a good French marriage, as if Langevin wasn't responsible for cheating on his wife, and being told to go back home) and with institutions (only when she became worldwide famous or made a tour in the USA did the French institutions finally decided to give her some prizes and decorations)
If the Germans in this thread are counting Hitler because he got the German citizenship along the way, then we can count her
And we didn't get mad because they counted Charlemagne
Feel free to add every famous dual citizen or citizen from predecessor states to your tally as well
Same there
Danton and Mirabeau too, aren't they
Maybe Marat too
You talk about the movies ? :p
They're still considered France's historical figures, and the kingdom of France is in direct continuity with Francia (kingdom of the Franks)
Also there was no Poland when Marie Curie was born, and countries like Italy and Germany were created 150 years ago, but their people didn't suddenly appear
Chopin has a bigger connection, but he actively claimed to be Polish and not French, and even asked to bring back his heart to Warsaw after his death
Marie Curie did not make the same choice, she did keep attachments to Poland (like the Polonium element), taught Polish to her children (one became Nobel prize winner and first woman minister in France), chose Polish nannies and helped to build a scientific institute in Poland, but as her friend Émile Borel said about her "she shared feeling between Poland, her native country, and France, her adoptive country". Of course, it would be wrong to pretend she is only French (as she is not), but she accepted to represent France and actively participated for France in the first World War (it also profited Poland but still)
The French press and institutions weren't always kind to her when she was still alive, but in the end there is absolutely no doubt France has accepted her as a national historical figure
Her body was even transferred to the Panthéon in 1995, in presence of the Polish president
I get what you mean, just that in France, we consider national figures people born long before there was a fixed idea of what France was (like Vercingétorix back in Antiquity), because they lived in what is today France's territory
And Charlemagne's son Louis I is the first Louis of France that goes until Louis XVIII
Vercingetorix isn't considered a french historical figure though
That said, Charlemagne and Clovis are, at least by popular standards (historians may disagree, since the franks weren't exactly the same as what french people became)
Originally, French kings were said to be Troy ans but from XIXth century, Napoléon III and finally the IIIrd Republic, Vercingétorix entered the French national roman and is still widely taught as school (unless it has completely changed)
His fight against the invador was put in parallel with the 1870 defeat against Prussia
Astérix is basically taken from this fight
I signed up on Reddit just for this thread lol

The English here in France are generally the WORST by far, spend tons of money getting ripped off and the guys seem to compete about who's going to spend more "MATE I CAN BUY 2 ROUNDS IN A ROW NO PROBLEM"; that kind of bullshit drives me nuts as a bartender
The Dutch/Scands/Germans/Eastern Europeans love EDM way too much
&#x200B;
Much love to the Spanish and Portuguese
By FAR the best tourists
I like how it sounds, can't really explain why
Maybe more "vowel" sounds makes it pleasant to hear
I also appreciate that the grammar is not too complicated
What I really don't like is that I never know how to pronounce new words
Or even some words I've known for a long time, know how to write and use, but never heard
Overall I enjoy it, but it's probably also because it can be used to communicate with almost anyone
Not sure how to compare it
Our spelling is a lot more consistent (even if not obvious at first if you don't know the rules), but our grammar is a lot more messy
I'll usually not use it in the same context, so not really something that can be compared for me
I like it as a language
What I particulary love however is hearing and speaking to non-native speaker in English
We got a chance to meet this situation pretty often here in Europe when you're abroad and in a highly touristic area
( basically every capital to begin with )
You know the so called international-English or " airport-English " or whatever it is really called, it makes the situation even more lovely in my opinion
Everyone throw their accents, tones, way of speaking English, habits from their native language and so on, that's beautiful
Sometimes you could just guess where someone is from just by the way they speak *their* English, well that was a fun game back in the days we could freely travel and book some hostel nights
Damn I love those moments, you could feel people were pretty cautious at articulating or even explaining their feelings with some dumb vocabulary to be mutually intelligible
They knew the burden to speak a language they aren't that familiar with, that's something I can relate when I try to speak to an American / British / Irish ( whoever from the Anglosphere ), sometimes I just can't keep up with the pace or the accent ( looking at you Brits / Irish )
PS : In that regard, I was busted fairly often, since we are not that good at hiding our French accent, zis is trou
I speak it purely for practical reasons
It’s not the ugliest language around but I like French and Italian way better
It's a very easy language with almost no grammar and conjugation and you can communicate easily, joke or have serious discussions with people who are not native english speakers as well
I wouln't say it's ugly although I feel like english lacks some style and melody, it's a very neutral and useful language imho
I love the dad jokes
We have wordplays in French of course, but they work very differently
I like how English creates very small expression for new things, when in French we have to use periphrasis (but I hate when one tries to literally translate them in French, I love my periphrasis too)
I dislike how imprecise your vocabulary feels
I know that there are a lot of very precise technical sociolects, with very precise vocabularies, but “everyday English” makes difficult to have deep conversations (beyond the obvious fact that I do not master this everyday English)
Hot take but I think English is one of the worst Indo-European languages, as I hate it's phonology so much
&#x200B;
Plus I also feel bad that it overwhelm other languages (Welsh, Irish,...) and I also hate that today we are kinda "forced" to learn it if we want to go international as it's very rare to quasi-impossible to find some other language speaking comunity outside of the one country it's spoken except English of course
However, I'm still having a hard time to convey my idea from French to English basically, it always seems toned down because I can't find the right vocabulary or the right way to assemble my thoughts
I really don't know if it's related to my level in English or just the language itself
> also I'm currently learning French, and while I love it, it is making me  want to die with some of its phrases (like why are there so many  combinations with que, ce and est)
About that, "qu'est-ce que c'est ?" is the right one because I see a lot foreigners using "qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?" to mean "what it is
" but the first one is the "authentic way" and the second a more emphasised way that you encounter way less often, if that give you some relief
But overall yea we use a ton of little words and prepositions to make our sentences
Yes, "er" ( pronounce roughly like E in Las Vegas ) or "ir" n French minus some exceptions because yeah French being French
And I believe "ar" / "ir" / "er" in Spanish
How about in Swedish ?
Congrats, no idea where "vachement" comes from despite it's widely used but french is a really fucked up language when you think about it, it comes from latin mostly but had an heavy celtic influence so there is some weird things like prononciation, sentences structures and some numbers
If you made your way through this I do respect that
Hey at least I speak it
This is pretty much the 101 for any languages in Europe it seems, except those Finno-Ugric folks
where are they ? Hungary ? Finns ?
Yes pretty much, I know for a fact that if it was a French name the S will be silent
All the schools have reopened at full capacity here, only higher education will resume in the autumn
No particular problems so far, the sanitary rules are respected
Nobody categorically refuse to wear a mask
Having my 12 years old daughter returning to school in Paris suburb makes me worry
They are in dummy age and fall brings lot of flus and crap with proximity
We shall see
Hmmm
No ? Where my mom worked (children from ~3 to ~10) there was only half kids at a time
In junior high school/high school, all the students didn't return
It's still very unclear how it will be in September
My wife is a teacher in high school, and she do not know if she will be in front of her students
I didn't say all the students were there, but technically it reopened
And I agree that the communication to the teachers is trash, good luck to your wife :)
Yeah, and that doesn't mean that all parents are willing to send their kids back
It wasn't just a matter of parents willing to send their kids back
The thing is, there was a limit of how much children there can be in one room, plus (again for children <10), there was so much to do in terms of cleaning/ making sure kids wash their hands enough / making sure they respected the distances that teachers were not able to their jobs as usual
For children > 10, only certain classes went back to school, and often it was student with difficulty, or that didn't really do the work at home during the lockdown
See my other comment, but yes, that was my point
And in high school, I do not know the numbers, but some students didn't went back at all, some for 2-3 days (at least in my wife's highschool)
Do you have some great or humoristic quotes from someone of your country ?
Here  in france  my favorite is "Do someone  actually believe  im gonna start a dictator career at 67 years  old " from de Gaulle
Is there  quotes  like this one from your country ?
Charles de Gaulle:
>Comment voulez-vous gouverner un pays où il existe 258 variétés de fromage ?
How do you want to govern a country where there are 258 varieties of cheese
&#x200B;
Coluche (a famous French humorist):
>Do you know why animal emblem of France is a cock
>Becasue that is the only bird than can sing with feet in manure
A famous debate happened during the 1988 French presidential election, between the two candidates (during the second part): the then-president François Mitterand, and the prime minister Jacques Chirac
(Basically there was a cohabitation at the time, between the president/chief of the state belonging to the PS -left- and the prime minister/chief of the government belonging to the RPR -right-.)
Jacques Chirac : Allow me to tell you (François Mitterand) tonight, that I am not the Prime Minister, and that you are not the President
We are two candidates, on an equal footing, who are submitting themselves to the French people's judgement, the only one that matters
You may allow me, then, to call you Mr
Mitterrand
François Mitterand: And you are absolutely correct, Prime Minister
Here's the [video] cause the delivery and facial expressions are everything
« Casse toi pauvre con » (fuck off you twat) was said by Nicolas Sarkozy when he was President to a man who refused to shake his hand and who said to him « Oh no don’t touch me, you dirty me »
so iconic
Felix Faure, french president in 1899, died while engaged in sexual activities in his office with his mistress
He had a fatal seizure while she was fellating him
George Clémenceau's epitaph of Faure was "Il voulait être César, il ne fut que Pompée" (wordplay in French; could mean both "he wished to be Caesar, but ended up as Pompey", or "he wished to be Caesar and ended up being blown": the verb "pomper" in French is also slang for performing oral sex)
The press gave the mistress the nickname "la pompe funèbre" (wordplay in French: "pompes funèbres" means "death care business" but could also be translated, literally, as "funeral pump".
But why would pornography  help  against sea-sickness  in the  first  place ?
>Well, the truth is that something really remarkable has happened to me, that I have written it here and I do not understand my handwriting
I'm reassured that I have the same issues as someone who used to lead an entire country
We have  something  similar  from de Gaulle "the french are veals
Who  was the unlucky  midget ?
Yes sorry  phone  correcting
Interesting  To know  but now  i wonder if  sailors do this often
Not good unfortunately
I think it's because we mostly associate them with Gypsies and people are really not fond of Gypsies
When I left for a summer job in the UK a few years ago, I told my parents that there would be Romanians and Bulgarians there and my parents told "Be careful that romanians don't steal your stuff, keep it locked".
It's too bad tho, everyone at this job was super nice and I never had any problem with romanians working there, they even taught me a few words like "la multi ani" or "multumesc"
This thread summarized :
"People being racist toward Gypsies but trying to act like gentlemen by apologizing (not for being racist but)  for confusing Romanians with Gypsies"
Fair enough, I don't think Romania think a lot about Aruba neither
Yes for french people I think it depend of where you're from
Northen people and north east people would probably feel more connected to german, england, belgium etc
in term of culture or food while the south of france would be more connected to mediteranean culture
For exemple, we often resum with: north of france cook with butter, south of france cook with olive oil
I think the celtic roots are present, even if we can feel different kind of celtic rootS from a region to another
Many people often think celtic roots are only for Ireland, scottland, brittany etc
while they are also for spain, portugal and even eastern countries
I am from Southern France and I feel closer, culture wise, to my fellow Italians and Spanish neighbours, than from my fellow Northern France nationals
Of course my popular cultural references are French in terms of tv shows, music, movies, but deeper aspects like the relation to family, social rules, and so on, I feel a greater connection with the Mediterranean culture than the one of Northern France
We should totally embrace our Latinity but our government keep being pro German (which is not a prb) and keep bad relation with Italian, so fck
I grew up in south-western France and I totally felt comfortable when I visited Spain and Italy, like there are some differences but there’s also a sense of familiarity when I looked at the way people behave with each other, much more so than when I visited other parts of France like Brittany or Lille, I guess it’s more a continuum rather than just speaking a related language
But it’s funny how after a few days in Italy you start to get the gist of what people are talking about, once you get the pattern of differences between Italian and French
Kinda off topic but on most of these posts I have to scroll down to find the responses from other French people
Now this one is filled with them
Where did you guys come out from lol
I wanted to say "same in France" and then I remembered our history with Morocco and I was like "oups
I genuinely feel closer to the Southern Europe and Northern Africa mentality than I do to Northern France or Europe
What I mean is : taking time to do your business right, socializing a lot, letting out emotions whether they're good or bad and making your voice heard (aka being loud ahah)
And of course olive oil
Cooking with butter is a heresy to me, except for dishes that specifically need it
I'm from Lyon and culturally we're close to Italy (when you forget about recent culture
If you include recent culture then it's probably the americans and I think it's the same for most countries on this planet
" Southerners mock us because of the fog and the rain " Same here and I'm not even from the north (I'm from lyon)
They are always like "we have the sun and cicada sounds, we don't have any cloud and it's warm" like it's heaven and I'm alway like "do you realise that not everyone like this
" they always think we are jalous while I hate heat, sun and dry landscapes
Vrai ça.
I'm the opposite on all points haha
As a guy from Brittany, not using butter is an heresy !
Yes Lyon has a lot of Renaissance type architecture in the older parts of the city, it feels italian
On the Presque-île and the other side of the Rhône it's mostly typical Lyon architecture and Paris Hausmann like architecture without the zinc roof tiles
I would say we are influenced a lot by the americans
The difference of life before and after WW2 is immense
We have huge malls, we wear jeans, american brands we eat american snacks
Fast food are extremely popular, we speak more and more english, we adopted consumerism, our most popular music is rap, we listen a lot to their music and we watch american movies
Basically the life in the US and in Europe is the same with slight changes
That's why I also think it's the same in all of Europe
Same, my definition of happiness is heavy rain sound (bonus if a bit of thunder), fog, good book or movie like lord of the ring, fireplace, tea or hot chocolate and no visitors
Then I'm a happy woman ;)
I'm from Southern France and let me tell you living in Paris is really hard during the winter because of the lack of sunlight (compared to where I'm from)
It would be the same in France because the government passed a law and like 40% or 60% of the music has to be french
Nobody wanted to listen to french music
Radios started playing french rap
That's how it became so popular
But what I mean is culturally, rap, french, english or chinese rap, still is american culture
well I live in Paris so
but I would say my favorites are Le Louvre, Notre-Dame, Place Vendôme, l’Obélisque and le Sacré-Coeur
I would love them even more if there were not ALL OF THESE TOURISTS but I guess we’re used to them
edit: oh and I forgot about les Arènes de Lutèce (Lutèce is the ancient name of Paris) ! it’s not the most famous place in Paris but it’s quite unusual
it’s a gallo-roman amphitheater
In my city of Grenoble there’s the apartment of Stendhal
We have our pride in knowing that he was born here
Probably not of much importance to anybody who isn’t french but hey :)
Well, next to my father's (and grandma) birth place is a rock known as the Mont-Saint-Michel, a glorified sand castle, you've heard of it i suppose
And where i spent half my life growing up, Saint-Malo, some [corsair] and [nazi] mixed shit
Real stuff for zombie apocalypse in both cases
I live in Rochefort, were the king Louis XIV was building all the french battleships
In Clermont-Ferrand, France is the place where Pope Urban II called for the first crusade
I’m from Aix-en-Provence France, and we have this huge corridor like street with little fountains on it and it ends at the end with a huge fountain with a circular road around it
It’s called the Cours Mirabeau makes after the famous French revolutionary that lived there
I live in a village of 250 souls, so my church
That's Charles Martel with one single l btw
And it comes from Old French *martel*, which is *marteau* today
Worth noting that the modern French word for hammer is marteau (pronounced mart-o), martel is the Old French word, which you still have in the verb marteler
Molotok in Russian
Hungarian ending for plural is also -k, is that why you're so close friends
Yes, we still have the verb marteler => to hit repeatedly
Also use for exemple to say "il m'a materlé de question"  =  he "hit" me repeatedly with questions: he asked me lots of questions again and again without letting be rest
Így van az égesz nyelv
Question**s** :)
He was literally French
And also molotochek (молоточек)
We use frapper in most case, marteler is in very specific situation, like the exemple I used
You can say "frapper au mateau" too
Maillet still exists in modern french
Probably related to the French word "maillet".
Franks are our ancestors dude
I'm Lorrain I know what I'm talking about
Well, I'm in an intership right now, so not so much (800€ EUR/month)
But my friends (25y) earn around 2000 EUR/month after tax in Paris
> earn 3000€ bruto (don't remember netto, maybe 1900€), save some 1000€ after paying living expenses
You just withdraw 25% from brut to net
So it is more likely to be 2500 if it was 3000 brut
Human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria
Heads would roll, blood would paint the streets, the dawn of the sixth republic
All the northerners would liquefy because of the heat, all the southerners would freeze to death
Honestly it would just be july/august as usual
But we're all already confused with Estonian
I'm not even sure we'd notice a difference
>the southerners would freeze to death I guess ?
We'll find any possible way (car, train, bus, plane, on foot
) to return to the south
But we'd grab food all over the place on the way back down
No reason not to !
A friend from latvia once told me about this, how they really dislike russian presence in their country that persists today, it seems like they have a very negative way of seeing that period
It's gross and used to be very common in France
Thankfully it was made illegal to pee in urban areas
You can get a fine of 68€ if you get caught
It’s fucking gross
I did it on occasion but always super drunk, always out of sight and always in bushes or in a river (so it does not stink up the place)
I still am not proud of it
Timidly clicked the NSFW topic wondering what the question is and how much trouble I’m gonna get in being on the work network
phew, I work in the urology department
Same in France but when it happens it's no big deal for anyone
I’ve only had this experience in some metro stations
Anywhere in the city, except in designated areas
Yeah, they clearly have not haha
I like them more mushy
I don't care about how Italians cook their pasta or what's supposed to be « the right way ». I'm French, I cook French and I like them soft
Oh you know my flatmate ? I kept telling him but he answered "let me make my own mistakes", it's been 5 years now, he even claimed a "pilaf rice" recipe excuse to do that heresy
And the trick for ultra perfect pasta is to have some spaghetti available
You put one in the pot to check the amount of salt
This way you don't need a fork to check
If you just write a "Yes
" to a simple question, automod deletes your comment for being too short
Non-Reddit reader : Paris is a bit dirty and messy
Reddit reader : Paris isn't real-world Mad Max
Paris is kinda ugly
They wear helmets now
Apparently, great uncle of mine had his skull fractured during a hurling match and died a few days later
Stoplights before roundabouts are a must have in high density areas
In Paris we got a lot of them and they're necessary, if you didn't have them the roundabout would pretty much be stuck
In that case the roundabout's goal is to be a intersection of 5+ roads
Do you not usually put your seatbelt on ?
Our spelling is as weird, or even weirder than english, but I've never heard of competitions like that in french
There was a reading competition in my school once but that's basically all
Maybe we don't like competitions, I don't know ?
French also have this "problem" of words or sounds you can write many ways or silent letters
You can write [o], *o*, *ô*, *au* or *eau* for instance
There's Spelling Bee in France, for instance *"Les timbrés de l'orthographe"* organized by the ministry of education, but I don't think it's as popular as Spelling Bee is in the US
I heard a lot, it's practically in every movies/tv show that's about a family with an elementary kid
Like if every "good kids without confidence or friends or good physic" in movies had win a spelling bee competition to prove they worse something
And no, it's not a something we have
It look a bit weird actually, not that fun
There is a writing competition though (Dictée Voltaire)
I remember seeing one on TV a long time ago (Girl lost on "agrafe", she spelled it "agraphe"), but I was a young kid so maybe it was just a movie
Can't tell for sure
We definitely have spelling bees at school level, I remember doing one at some point, but it's not the big spectacle that the American ones are
Many if these words are French so the obscure is kinda hard lost from my point of view, but if it's the same feelings For English speakers as when I see the German words I can understand it
Dictées Pivot too
I reached the final of my département when I was a kid
isn't it the projet voltaire
Also, it's more an exam and a reminder on how to write in french rather than a competition IIRC
You don't get anything but a certificate that you know the spelling rules
It depends on where you're from, I guess
Where I live, it's pronounced the same way
As other said it really depends where you come from, for instance [*rose*] doesn't sound the same everywhere in France, you can hear \ʁoz\ or \ʁɔz\
*ô* is always pronounced \o\ (I don't have a counter-example in mind), *o* is often pronounced \ɔ\ but you'll have example where it's pronounced \o\ like in *fosse*, *chose* or *prose*
*au* and *eau* are also pronounced \o\, some same story as between *ô* and *o*
o, au and eau definitely sound the same in many regions
ô might be different in the east of France because they go heavy on ^ accent (on top of adding them everywhere)
In French we'd make grammar competitions
Yeah
I went up to national half final when i was a kid
Yes, Pivot, not Voltaire !
There is the projet Voltaire, which is a bit like the French TOEIC, but there is also an event where dozens of students gather in a huge room to write a text a guy reads in a microphone
IIRC it’s part of the projet Voltaire
I’ve done it
Never received anything
Oh, I didn't knew about that
There's the infamous dictée of Prosper Mérimée where every word is a trap
Easy, everyone vote for his candidate, and the 2 best at the first round (if nobody got 50% or more already) go into a final round, where everyone has to vote again, but only between those two this time
And everyone are equal in term of voice
One vote = one vote
We vote directly for them
If no candidate has more than 50% of vote (it never happen), but best scored candidate compete a few days later
We vote directly for one of them
If you wants to vote but don't like any candidate you can just vote "white", but they don't count the white votes to know how many they were so it's useless
It's the least kingly king though
He's more like your friendly uncle who's gonna hand you a cold one while he grills a few sausages during a summer bbq, and will watch football of the couch while nursing a hangover with doritos
And every sensible country yeah
The US voting system is so complicated it seems, why do you elect someone to vote in your place
That seems really weird and outdated
We also often say "you vote for the person you want on the first round but against the person you don't want on the second"
This exactly
States usually have a "head of state" and a "head of government". Thé head of state's role is to guarantee a continuity of power (as soon as the king dies, his heir instantly becomes the new one
Same with presidents during an inauguration type ceremony
The head of government is the one with proper power and who decides of the country's policies
This role Can be vacant (looking at you belgium)
If so is thé case you still have someone at the head of the country
It's funny, in France we have the same system but I have never seen case 1 in my lifetime !
I mean, that’s the way the French president was elected for quite some times, even under the 5th Republic
True, but I mean, Prins Pils
Beatrix didn't seem _that_ down-to-earth to me
You're a bit right, the fifth republic was made around the person of De Gaulle, he want a powerful leader and he believed in a strong head of state
The idea at the time was that the president should be detached from partisan politics to do their job
Meaning that while a president can _come from_ a party, they should not be _of_ a party
There is also the fact that we have a two-round election: people vote "with their heart" on round one, meaning that they vote for whoever convinced them among the numerous candidates (there were 9 in 2017, I believe
), but round two usually is an "elimination" round: people vote for whoever they dislike less
Meaning that even if a candidate were to form a kind of cult like Trump did, they would likely not pass round two (because during round two the votes are redistributed)
Of course this principle has its limits, and not everybody acts as De Gaulle did when he was a president, but that’s what he had in mind
Our system is kinda complicated because we elect the president directly and then we elect députies for the assemblée nationale
The majority party usually ends up being the president's. He then chooses a prime minister with whom he forms the government
The national assembly Can overthrow the government and the president can dissolve the assembly
So it's like a regular parliamentary system except that the executive branch is divided between the president and the prime minister
Effectively, the president has more power even though the constitution isn't explicit about it
Trump is a big reason to change it
Haha I like it, I enjoy [this one too]
>overly talkative people
So, like, they say "hi" to their neighbors ?
>Bavaria
> \- Gods holy land and a nation made of the direct descendents of Jesus and his royal highness King Ludwig themselves
They are of majestic beauty, speaking in sacred tongues only understood by those God deemed worthy
Generous, intelligent (just bc you don't speak our sacred tongue does not mean it's not smart things that we have to say) and hard-working
Everybody loves us in all of Germany and all over the world
It's true
We have the best beer and the best food, at the very latest since we acquired a new Franconia that now graces our large inventory of smaller countries that sometimes try to defy our warm godly embrace but in the end know that their place is by our side and thus by the side of all that is right and good in this world
This is where God and everyone else in Germany comes to dine and for vacation and spends abnormous amounts to have a small piece of our country
And then we are unkind and condescending to them bc that is what the Lord told us to do
Amen
All the reasons I chose to move there <3
Ostrava it is, then
FOR THE EMPEROR
The home turf of socialist leader Ségolène Royale (known as "Ségo")
She's the enlightened genius that executed the solar highway experiment despite countless engineers showing why it is a terrible idea
Imagine a chunk of the country managed by that person : Segoland
Vendée was royalist during the French revolution
As punishment a big part of the population was massacred
Since then they've historically been generally against the Republic and are pushing to have the events of the revolution recognized as a genocide
You grow up in a rust belt area from a family of people with gone jobs like mining or lo-tech manufacturing
You think socialist policies are great, but them (perceived as) foreigners stealing our jobs and (perception of) by-passing your struggle makes you very unhappy
Your other answer to that question was better
Ha, in France, there's the same stereotype about people in Normandy
Even better, I'm a Cogboy at ~~heart~~ mechanical blood-pump
Yes, that works with right-wing too
Our nationalist party, FN, is kinda schizophrenic like that, it's labelled extreme right, but some of their propositions are socialist policies
Praise, brother
Doesn't feel all that special when it's been around your entire life
When I was younger I lived in the north of France and had a couple of friends in Brussels and we often went there to see our mates and have fun as they had excellent beers compared to French bars at the time
It was only a two hours drive so it was easy
I lived in Nice & french riviera from 0 to 20 so you can imagine how often we went to Italy as it's literally \~30min to the border, it was a very common destination (Monaco too, as a country)
&#x200B;
Since I'm in Paris now it's kinda the same thing with Benelux & northen germany (albeit a bit more long)
&#x200B;
Edit : and might I add it was quite a natural thing too, if you're alreay in car u say why not hop in by italy and you just do it without thinking about it, it's just the next stop on the highway, no hassles
It's amazing and really cheap ! I'm only 21 but I've visited almost all countries in Europe
Whether it is by train, by plane, car or even bus it's so easy to travel
I did a euro trip with interflix where I went to Prague, Budapest, Split, Zagreb and Venezia, I paid 100€ for the transport and slept in the bus for half the nights
one of my favorite trips, really cheap and had an amazing time !
I live in the most Western region in France, so basically unless I'm willing to go to the British Isles which is a long trip on it's own - by european standards -  I'm doomed to hop a plane or to cross my entire country for the nth time
This is however another story for anybody living in the South western France, French Riviera, near the Swiss or German border, and let's say all the way up to Lille, near the Benelux indeed
We went to Greece in the middle school once
That was a great experience
Did school trips in Italy (one in Rome & one in Firenze), Belgium, Luxembourg, and England
That’s a really cool thing about the EU
I went to Roma with my class in 10th grade and it was amazing :)
Same thinking
Yeah it allowed me to have out of country school trip (Spain twice or thrice, Italia, Germany) but even that, for a school trip it's more about the trip than the destination
Outside of that, don't really care
Also note that this is the first neutral (not positive) comment I spot and we are both French, so maybe it's just good old French pessimism
Damn, were you in public school
I heard they do more school trip since the government help financially
I was in private school
The only school trip I got in my entire scolarity is 5 days in a Carmel without religious women, helping them the garden, as a religious retreat to "think about ourself".  3 weeks before the bac exam -\_- . Of course, no cellphone
You just made me remember a PTSD when I was waiting for my plane to Ireland and they specifically asked for passports
I was chatting with my sister during that time, " eh could you check for me if Ireland is in the Schengen Area ? No ? ... Well, too bad ".
They had me for 30minutes until there was a small way for European Union residents *who happened to travel just with their ID* \- like any Schengen Area country, they just decided to make their own policy, and they had me on that
Could be french pessimism but I don't think so, I'm just not someone that is very into traveling so being close to other countries doesn't really do anything to me
I guess it'll be nice if one day I want to travel
I’m real glad we sorted the phone thing on a European level
Much more practical this way
I was in a private school, and then a private classe prépa actually :)
I also did the spiritual retirement thing, but luckily nobody expected us to help the religious women & men (yep, I did it thrice -women, men, men)
I think you don't have to live close to borders to see giant swarms of Spaniards and any other Europeans diving in a small country
Just my two cents
Thanks for clarifying ! No worries, it makes sense
At the end of the day it was my fault not to double-check this kind of thing, I took it for granted in a way
Me neither, but that's because nobody care on visiting my region, except the Brits
The Brits are everywhere anyway
Ici c'est les néerlandais plutôt
Tu es des Hauts-de-France ? =)
Non de Lorraine pourquoi
Je connais pas forcément ce coin, c'est vraiment à l'autre bout de chez moi, je pensais tout naturellement que y aurait plus de Néerlandais vers Lille, cela étant en Lorraine ça marche tout aussi bien
Ah mais ils sont partout
What’s an object from your daily life which you think is uncommon in other countries
My cancoillote
Even in my own country you can only find it mainly in my region
It is a local cheese
You can spread it on bread
Also, it smells actually good
I swear
And I don't say this like "camember smells good" because a camambert compared to another can smell better or smell "good" like "I can tell this cheese is good by the scent", no, it ACTUALLY smells nice
A knife for [cheese] but this has more to do with me loving cheese than me being French I think
Also, this type of tissue [bag] to carry your baguette when you buy it at the boulangerie/bakery
That sounds really great
I was expecting to see the briki, which also comes with the 2-in-1 mini stove oven with a dedicated briki burner ^^
I just googled them and the designs look so cute
I'm going to swamp you with a third comment on those boots, but it's gotten me thinking; I own a vintage Dale of Norway sweater from my mom and it's one of my favorite pieces of clothing
I don't think I'd need boots like yours, but are there other brands or types of Norwegian clothing and outerwear which you'd recommend, which are also that type of traditional thing
I just love the style so much
Oh I love these
How do they fair at the end of the season when the snow begins to melt
Is there anything you need to do to preserve them for next year or can you just dry them off inside and store them for next time
I haven’t seen a can opener like that since, quite literally, visiting a WWI museum haha
I’m very interested in that toaster
I assume to toast aslice of bread you’d need to turn it over
Are there other types of can openers
Also, toasting rolls & buns sounds like genius
Does it look different from a normal rifle
Does it have an insignia on it like a Swiss knife
Super common in France
Wow that’s impressive
I’ve seen beer glass collections in bars in the past, but tbh I always assumed it was something the beers brand did as a gimmick and to make money
Does this mean that the boot glass is actually a thing
I always kind of assumed it was a tourists’ gimmick
I have one that I love
Granted, it’s from an Italian brand :)
I remember noticing that
It’s not very convenient
A birthday calendar in the toilets
That's the most Dutch thing
They exist in France as well but are not used every day I think
I’ve never really seen them in normal life but they’re ubiquitous in all the hospitals I’ve worked at for giving bed baths
Where I live in Bavaria, the same thing exists for [spätzle]
Not to be intentionally dense but why are your sinks in such need of scraping
Cancoillotte
Oooh, I’ve not though of those in years
So useful, I miss owning one
Thanks for the reminder, I’m gonna buy one now
Is that just your preference or is it pretty ubiquitous to Swiss homes
I keep seeing it in the store and I’ve been curious to try it but don’t really know how to use it
Italy has those too
Something that almost all of my Muslim friends in the UK have and getting more common in Muslim French households which are turning away from having a separate bidet
That’s adorable
It reminds me of Thomas the Tank engine
Nice cheese knife
I know some people who have them in Germany as well
Just googled welshcakes, they look delicious
I’ve seen this in Italy too
I’m surprised it’s a thing in two countries which are so far apart
That looks super convenient
What dishes do you use it for
I know this as the tool to make mashed potatoes with
This isn’t mandatory in places that I’ve lived in to the extent of my knowledge
Is the point to be visible to traffic
Bidet used to mean pony, it’s very archaic though
Now bidet just means, well, bidet
I’ve never been to à European country where teabags weren’t a thing :)
Oh hey, are you Muslim
All my Muslim friends in the UK have a shower bidet now and I’m so glad that the demand from their communities is making it so much more common because I miss washing my butt properly haha
Oh I know the porro thing
Ended up drunk a couple time because of it in a bodega in Nantes
Bidet in French means bidet, lol
For lots of my Arabic friends, they mostly have a shower head plumbed into the toilet to use rather than a separate bidet
It’s mandatory in Muslim households to wash properly with water after a Number 2 so even in countries where it’s really uncommon to have a bidet (like the UK), there’s essentially a watering can by the toilet to allow for proper washing
True immersion was a discovery for me in Ireland
I did see the same thing once in Israel, but it was so warm that having less warm water was less of a big deal
Wait, is it not
I thought it was to review your stool
My Norwegian friend sent me one as a gift, we honestly had no idea what to do with it and nearly took our fingers off trying to work it out
She came to stay and made it look so simple that it was kind of embarrassing
I keep stationary items in mine, it's convenient
Oh mon dieu ! Une soeur qui me comprend !
The split is to pick up the pieces of cheese
If I may ask, you say they’re not waterproof, but they still do well in snow
Same, I should move to the mountains just to be able to wear those
Ah thank you so much
And what about lighter clothing
Is there a way to find embroidered dresses or something of that sort
Oh that is also very pretty
Thanks for the tip :D how do you call that type of traditional patterns, does it have a name
Mostly they come with a pull ring
Admittedly it’s not fool-proof and sometimes pops off or the can doesn’t have one so I’ve always had a double wheeled one like this:
I see, that is convenient indeed
That’s pretty cool actually, thanks for sharing :D
I still think the mixer is a superior option, but tbh if you wanted that you could buy this [thing] which mixes the two water flows for you
Ahh, so there is actually a reason
Thanks for explaining :)
Well there's that, but I heard it's also to prevent any [Poseidon's kiss]
Can be one or the other in my experience, I prefer the shower one because you don’t have to move
Thanks for the tip
No I mean I saw a drier shelf exactly like the one you linked, above the sink
I ought to try and make pulled pork
Each time I think it's just going to take too long, and I'll end up with a lot of meat, but I guess I could freeze some of it
Yaay I am most honored
What Dutch treat do I get
That sounds good, thanks for the idea :)
Interesting
I did wear these as a kid but it was a safety thing and not mandatory
They are found in most people's homes in Germany for instance
Oh boy, I’m howling hahaha
Apparently it did mean that a few centuries ago, you weren’t too far off, but we now say poney for a pony
I see
I guess when it’s that cold, the snow really doesn’t melt for most of the season
Thanks for explaining
Thanks
I’ll look into it, maybe I could knit or embroider some myself :)
I know right
They should advertise more
We need a wider sample size
But I already own [this version
That’s not nice :(
All of this is so cute, I really want one now
Honestly I’m pretty sure I saw all three of those, as I stayed in multiple Airbnb’s during my last trip
But maybe I just got lucky
But I like it :( and it works
It was always a shared apartment where the people also lived and one room was an Airbnb
But I only saw it once I think, so probably just an anomaly
I have no idea what is a Hermitcraftlike server ? Care to introduce me to it ? c:
Thank you
So it just means survival
Thought it could be more than that darn
Clean streets (but it got better), no grafitti/tags on buildings, more public toilets
Returnable bottles and cans
In Sweden (and I believe Germany and probably many more places too) when you buy something in a plastic bottle or can, you receipt will show 1 or 2 additional kronor (10 or 20 euro cents), and there are spots in every large supermarket where you can submit these empty bottles to get that money back, and the bottles are sent back to the initial seller, I believe
Plastic bottles are such a large part of the trash over here, it would be be able to return them instead of throwing them all away
\- More drive thru in cities: it's a nightmare is you're driving and near a bakery/other shop, just need one thing but can't park
Many just park in the middle of the road wich make trafic worse
\- shop open 24h/24h or at least not close during lunch break
\- "wilde" campside: here it's forbidden to camp where you want and camp site doesn't feel the same than in the USA for exemple: here you're definitly not as mure in nature
\- more foreign restaurants, especially affordable one
\- more sport and art at school and scool club/dances, selling etc
and other "fun" things
\- free public toilets, ande MORE public toilets
I need to use the restroom often and I really often have to go backhome earlier or to by someting in a café to use the bathroom
\- Cheap street food
We only have the same few sandwiches, ice cream in summer and crêpe/waffle
Hazelnut Yoplait yoghurt and apple Fanta
I discovered these in Ireland and they were never sold in France although Yoplait is a French brand
We have bidets in houses but people put laundry in them and most people don't even know what their purpose are
> Dublin's safe feeling in the city center
In Athens sometimes you feel you have walked into Karachi or Mogadishu at night if you walk alone in some areas
Where/when did you live in Dublin
Things have gotten significantly worse the last couple of years, especially northside
There is a big contrast between southern Europe and northern when it comes to cooking:
No technicly it's forbidden and called "wild/savage camping", a few decade ago i was sill possible but not now
Same with campervan, even if you find a nice spot in the middle of nowhere, police would probably come in the night to ask you to live in the minute
So you can try but it's better to do it very discretly and hope the forest owner won't see you and be a jerk
Yes I thought about iand it is not compatible with my job and often with my health
If I can I use my bike, if not public transport, but I still often have to use my car
It's also a matter of tourism and overusage
Sweden is huge, not as dense, but mostly not attracting as much tourism as the various regions of France where you'd want to camp
I'm saying as someone who can't wait to go back to Sweden to enjoy it, though
For many places, you are right
Where I live however, it is too mountainous
There is a 400m altitude difference between my home and my work place
Exactly, here their is not much spare land (most "spare land" have private owners), and even in places like in mountains area you can only walk a few of hours without seeing a way
And only about like a couple of hour maybe, without seeing a fence, a farm, a sign, a refuge etc etc
And every "nice spot" like when there is a nice view, near a river with relativly easy access, a glade etc
a quite touristic: you can't camp there diescretly and you won't be alone for long
So you would have to camp completly in the forest, not even in a glade and that's not really practicle for most people, no view, etc and making a fire would be dangerous and illegal if it's not your forest since most forest are quite dry (the northen part of the country don't have most forest and most of then are too small for a walk that need a a night camp)
Living in an old city:
Roads are made for horses and carts, not for modern cars
Trafic: horrible, parking slots: scarse
Public transportation is vital
Buildings are not easily accessible to the disabled, they are "retrofitted" to get elevators, electricity
A/C... which may lead to strange setups
In France for instance, elevators were usually installed in the middle space left by the stairwell
This leads to tiny elevators, fitting like 2 people
You have tons of historical preservation rules that make upgradings of buildings more difficult and more expensive
As soon as you dig, you find historical stuff
Public works take ages because of that
I have lived in a 17th century building in the heart of Paris
Not a single wall was straight, and the floor wasn't that even either
5 floors no elevator building (no space to retrofit an elevator)
Plumbing was probably outdated, but electricity was relatively recently redone
I love my city, but it did have a big renovation job done in the 19th century, so most of its architecture/organization is not that old
Paris
The nightmare of drivers when we still had cd players in cars
Can't speak for everyone, but here we got our loads of WW2 bombs / mines but nothing older than 1950s to testify how does it feel to live in a old civilian building
What is even ironic here is the buildings the Allies tried to destroy are still in place, without a single scratch, like nothing happened
Not the fairest deal of the century you could argue
A big chunk of Paris is from the 1900-1920 period and is considered historic
It’s just that most of the buildings look pretty similar to Hausmanian ones so people just assume everything is Hausmanian
All the time
People here vote "against" someone way more often than "for" someone
In each election since it's a two rounds system and therefore in the first round you vote for the one you want in charge and in the second one, as there are 2 remaining candidates, against the one you don't want at all ruling
Wasn’t there actually something about Orbán being one of the only European leaders that do accept the number of immigrants the EU asks them to take in
Not sure at all, but I believe I remember hearing that in geography class (the teacher said it was a shame/shameful France was not doing its part)
You think most of America is significantly left of Biden
In what way were people "forced" to vote Biden in the primary
Ok, but that sounds like people don't think America is left enough to vote Sanders, not that anyone was forced to do anything
They may be wrong, but I'm not sure there's evidence of the contrary
Given the covid I would say la bise, let's see how it goes after the immunity
Mardi gras
Going out in the street in disguises, eating very fat food
I live in brittany, the french government has tried its best to crush local languages and cultures for centuries now and not much has been done to save anything that disrupts cultural unity
Its really sad
Breton music, festivals, songs, food are slowly dissapearing, becoming either clichés or just vanishing
Wait, Jesus used to do the deliveries to Portugal himself
without subcontracting to one of the two weird bearded men who had cornered the European market
I was always surprised how little Germans sing in random occasions or between friends , during the years I have lived there
Definitely much less than in France
Traditional music and dance is still quite alive in France, with some big festivals, but not very popular either
There was a big collection effort in the last decades to preserve old dances and songs from old people, so that they don't completely disappear
Also, in Lyon we used to put candle on December 8 for Mary, the fête des lumières, but I fear the big touristic event may kill the tradition
How is this not child labor
It might be why this tradition is disappearing
Is it though
You can still see the chalk inscriptions on doors everywhere
When the roads are [like this] we slow down and go on the sides as much as possible and it's usually good enough for both cars to cross
In the North it's ok
In some parts of the South (mainly the Alps and the Riviera) and Parisians when they come to the countryside, they drive ABOVE the speed limit (frequently seen people driving faster than 100 km/h in small mountain roads)
These usually have an 80km/h speed limit around here, though most people wouldn't go that fast obviously
If visibility's good, i'll usually go 60 or 70, when there are turns that block sight, i'll stick to 40-50, rarely less than that (i probably would if I knew encountering another driver on that road was common, but I haven't been in that situation yet)
I just pray everytime a truck is coming in my direction
I'd say "Non, je ne regrette rien" from Edith Piaf for France
Anything from Gainsbourg represents the french spirit quite well, according to me
&#x200B;
And then, there's this one : [
I would say "Aux Champs Elysées" by Joe Dassin is the song which is the most associated with France, but it doesn't really represent France
The non-official anthem still remains Le Chant des Partisans
Edith Piaf's song, besides their popularity, don't really have a national pride ring to them
I don't like Paris but ''Aux Champs Elysees'' is known worldwide and talks about a famous French avenue
The lacs du Connemara
C’est marrant je l’ai jamais écoutée
The opening of Grieg's Piano Concerto would be nice too
At least it would startle the opposing team in international sports games
I was always told that "Don't look back in anger" by Oasis was the unofficial anthem of the UK
I mean, if you are French speaking, you're going to associate a lot of old French songs to France I think
This is my answer too
True, and I do agree, but I doubt the far right would feel too happy about a communist song representing the country
Also I went for what must probably be most known French song internationally that I know of
Je sais, mais je pense que la chanson d'Edith est plus connue
Seulement si t'es étudiant et bourré !
As a French: yesssss, the anthem of my student days
Living in the UK: people only know Edith Piaf :(
It's a lullaby
Is it really a French music though (I genuinely have no idea) ? Because a lot of lullabies that we hear are usually translated in another language and that's it
Perso je la déteste mais c'est une musique super connue à l'Internationale
Écoute plutôt la foule de Piaf, c'est une chanson fabuleuse
Jamais été convaincu ni par la vie en rose, ni par je ne regrette rien, mais peut-être en réécoutant un jour
Edit: j'ai réécouté et c'est super je ne regrette rien, mais pas sa meilleure
As a traditional anthem, I feel like Jerusalem would be the most obvious choice
Malheureusement certains restent adulescents trop longtemps (collègues traumatiques)
I know it's hard for an Irish to acknowledge, but the Scottish anthem is by far the best in the Six Nations
Even if you're not Scottish you just want to send the English home
Well Today I Learned then, I would have expected you guys to have a translated version
Took us 1 year with that new squad
The Paris region in France is called Île de France
It translates to Isle of France
It's smack in the middle of the mainland
Kind of a well-known fact, but the oldest bridge in Paris is called the "Pont-Neuf" which means "New bridge"
Le Marais (the Marsh) in Paris is a very posh and very touristic gay and jewish neighborhood, right in the middle of the city
[Châteaudun] means "castle castle", as "dun" is celtic for a fortified place and "château" meant any fortified place during the MA
Departments of France are usually named after rivers or mountains
In South of France there is the [Var department] named after the river Var, wich flows in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Alpes-Maritimes departments (1OO km west of the Var department)
It dates back change of territory in the department century ago, but they never updated the name
The city Lyon, France, is definitely not a lion
Les Landes,  in the southwest of France, means moorland, because it used to be a desolated flatland and a marsh
But Napoleon the third dried the land by planting trees, making it one of the biggest forest in Europe
The name stayed though
Are you sure
According to wikipedia it says that Wales comes from the germanic Wahl which means "who speaks a celtic or roman language / langue Gallo-romaine" or "who doesn't speak a germanic language". It says that it was wrongly considered to mean foreigner when, in fact, it's a linguistic term
In latin languages the W became a G and Wales is then (Pays de) Galles in French
It has the same origin as Gaulish
In the case of Wallonia (the french speaking part of Belgium) the W was conserved but it has the same linguistic origin
It has no common origin with Gaelic tho, despite sounding the them
And I've looked it up a bit and it has also the same origin as, for example, Wallachia (Romania) and even Walnut is from it (Wales Nuts)
It's meaning is closer to "who speak a non-germanic language" than to foreigner, even tho it's understandable that the confusion was made, especially in Great Britain following the saxon invasion, the Welsh were, for the saxon, the non-germanic speakers
And in Belgium, the Wallons, are again, according to the Dutch and Flemish, the "non-germanic speakers" as they were speaking French
Let's all non-germanic of Europe Unite and call ourselves Welsh
Another in France: the oldest bridge in Paris is named Pont-Neuf ("New bridge")
"Come and try our newest bridge in town" "wow such bridgy - very pathway"
But which is Northampton North of Southampton
I've seen two interpretations:
- it's because it's almost surrounded by three rivers
- it's derived from old Frankish *Liddle Franke*, which meant little France
(Unlikely since Frankish became extinct long before the name *Île de France* appeared, in the late 14th century)
I always considered it to mean something like "the Crown Land". And remember that names come from a time when Parisians were not that cliché (which they still are not IMO)
Every city with stone bridge from the middle age has one (like Toulouse)
Most of the time the "old" bridge was a wooden one who was destroyed since then
Yes, but it's a tiny island
There are bigger islands within *Ile de France*.
*Ile de France* is 4,638 sq miles, while *Ile de la Cité* (Notre Dame island) is 0
08 sq mile
You got two "main" tiny islands on the Seine, Ile Saint-Louis and Ile de la Cité (there's also l'ile aux cygnes (= swann island but never seen a swann there) on which you can find a smaller replica of the Liberty Statue)
edit: that link [
Actually yes, Notre Dame is on a island
Actually for the time this bridge was kind of a novelty because it was forbidden to build any kind of building on it (think of famous bridges in Italy with houses on it
All of Paris was like that)
The bridge was designed to get you across the river, yes, but also as a leisure area for the Parisians to stroll
Speaking just for my country, I guess it's different in others
But part of France "unification" was made by erasing regional languages and dialects
It's only in the last ~50 years that we stopped trying to get rid of these, and some are now optionally taught in school, but almost nobody talk anything else than French
Even if there are countries where this didn't happen (I was surprised the first time I heard about Catalan
) , this kind of history makes people wary
Just to give an example, the EU members don't even have the same culture about the relationship between those who are in power and those who are subjects to power
I think by now, France has a staggering reputation to go on strike or protest whenever it can, but this is the result of visioning the balance of power as a constant conflict (*rapport de force*) where each got to defend his/her own yard
But if you go to countries who were more versed into Protestanism before, this kind of attitude wouldn't be received well
Maybe a German can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I feel that in Germany, you get to distinguish and prove yourself as a leader, not because you're the most capable, you have exceptional skills or whatever, but because you proved you could rally the most people around you
And again, if you would try to import that in France, most of us would be left confused in the best case scenario
So if we'd have a European Union federation state, that kind of things would be vital to sort out, and the thing is that I don't know how one could arbitrate that fairly without creating more problems than there were before
Why do you hate you country so much that you want it to disapear as sovereign and have no longer power ?
A vote with 40 million people, you have very more power than a vote with 500 million people who have not the same political interest as you
I think there is a solution to preserve culture and language diversity, and even maybe help the come back of some dialect
A language like Esperanto, which is not linked to any country but has its own culture could stop anglicisation and ease communication, education and travelling all across Europe
Because it happened
Savoisien culture is disappearring
Independant countries can have different laws also
My region have never been a country like most of other regions of France
It have its cultural specifities but nothing that would justfiy to been split from the rest of the country but this is the french centralized state that created the most of what we have
If i go in a other region, the things will exactly the same
That's why we are part of a unified in country
It is naive to think that Europe allows us to protect ourselves from the USA or China
Poland in 2003 with EU pre-accession funds first purchased F-16s. Belgium and Italy have bought F-35s. The European Union is full of American military bases and previous American leaders have always been very pro-European with sometimes very proactive ambassadors' comments
The import tax rate is only 2
5% outside the EU, i.e. bread crumbs
Many projects paid with European funds are sometimes carried out by Chinese companies
The Chinese have no difficulty whatsoever in reaching our markets and acting negatively in Europe
The EU protecting is a joke and the Americans and the Chinese laugh when they hear that a strong EU will protect European markets
All they have to do is put pressure on one of the Member States to veto any decision that would be against their interests
About 10 years ago i started to grow my own vegs in the countryside after an accident since I found a girlfriend who grows everything (from medicinal plants to olive oil
) we learnt to respect what we eat, the meat we have is from animals we know and take like 1/4 of the animal
We are in no way "hippy" but i can understand in towns sandwiches, kebabs etc since the covid more and more people are coming here and that's a great thing and starting to appreciate the way of life eating around the table
Just saying, crappy food you don't really want to share when you have salads/tomatoes from the garden and a steak of neighbours cow you want to share with respect to what you are eating
Hoping people realise junk food is only junk food
Where are you from OP ? Just curiosityy
I may have a hard time sleeping the weeks I get up early (4AM) but I tend to have good cooked meals
We take turn cooking with my SO
Recently got a dietetician to help us planning the food thing and eat less garbage
I also wonder if OP has kids
I bet OP's parents prioritized those things, and OP will have a chance to prioritize those things once they have kids (if they have kids)
We were on the same page until the two hours evening meal
It’s usually just a ~45min thing with my family, more than that when we take the aperitif, which we do both on weekdays & during the weekend, but we don’t have one every day off/weekend at all (and it’s not only adults who drink alcohol, all the 15yo+ that want some get some, they just get less of it/don’t get strong alcohol)
Agreed with all the rest
I'm paid to work 35h per week
I'm not going to work any more than that
Plenty of time to live and do things
I agree with your description
I used to skip breakfast but i don't because i have kids now, so we eat together, fully sitted
we have 20min to eat
Lunch at work is exactly as you describe, we have a cafeteria and we take about an hour to eat and have coffee, but sometimes we take longer, with the benediction of the boss
On the other hand the dinner is much shorter, 30min, 40min, because the kids have got to go to bed not too late
But we do eat together and share stories about our days
I have so much sleep I wonder it's not too much
How can they make enough to live
We got the "love locks" plague
Tourists who only care about posting a romantic picture on Instagram are putting locks everywhere and creating metal pollution in rivers and seas when throwing the keys
I should also mention that bridge rails collapsed in Paris under the weight of hundred of locks, putting other visitors in danger
"Fête de la musique" launched in France during the 80's. It's now in many countries as "Music day" but without the joke - "Do music !" and "Celebration of music" sounds the same in French
The idea is that anyone can play music once a year without the usual restriction (pay the author, be quiet especially after 22h, have talent
It's fun, especially in large cities
La fête de la musique, a national festival created in 1982 by the initiative of one of France's ministers
Since then, a hundred countries have adopted the idea but it originally is a french idea
I don't think we have a normal/typical city because the cities in the south are so different from the ones in the north, I'd like to say Paris but 80% of the population hates it
Maybe Lyon
As for the most foreign, I'd say Saint-Denis in La Réunion (very different culture) or Cayenne in Guyane (wet equatorial climate)
I grew up in the South-West
Cities up north like Lille  feel a bit different, with all the dark brick building
Lyon felt quite different too, almost Italian
Strasbourg looks very German
I'd say Bordeaux or Grenoble has a more typical architecture
I know this is ask Europe, but as an American, Miami is easily the most foreign city I've ever been to in the US
LA, NYC, SF, Atlanta, NOLA, etc
all have something similar about them
But being in Miami is basically like being in Latin America
I grew up in north west of france (Rouen) and the city I feel is the most foreign to french culture is Strasbourg and every ski station in Alpes and Pyrénées
I'd go for Lyon as the most typical because it is actually a bit of everywhere else and there's also extremely wealthy and popular neighborhood, so it looks like an mashup version of France
As for 'foreign' all the cities at the borders have taken from their neighbours: Lille is very Belgian, Strasbourg is very German, Thonon is very Swiss, Menton is very Italian
edited for clarity
I mean
Strasbourg ? Metz ? They definitely were better choices here
Oh God I know this place very well
So weird to read about it on reddit
Then there are villages in the Basque Country being very close to their Spanish consins
I agree that Strasbourg looks "foreign" and someone else said it below but compared to oversees Régions I'd say it still looks more French
Metz looks like a pretty typical French historic city but still a lot of German influence
Strasbourg could fit, Metz is pretty typical of a French city
I found the vieux port of Marseille quite special, but the rest of the city is nothing particular
Otherwise, othersea territories are the obvious answers
I don't think Lyon looks Italian, compared to Nice or even Cannes
For example, in the South close to Italy (Menton, Nice especially), they got those special louver shutters (persienne/persiana) which can be lifted like [the one on the 2nd picture] This is very uncommon elsewhere
We even call those shutter 'a l'italienne'.
In general, the city layout in residential area are made to protect people from the sun while still getting some light, with narrower streets, mini piazzas every three blocks, white and/or yellow tones
In the north every building is grey, basically
The use of sculptures on buildings, even if it's just a head above the door is also uncommon beside king's residences and churches
That said the Italy we refer to is most often the cities next to France, so maybe those are not what you consider 'typically Italian'!
Hmmm while I agree that Metz FEELS French, the architecture of the city isn't for a good portion of it
Le Vieux Lyon est calqué sur la renaissance italienne, architecturalement, le Vieux Lyon c'est comme en Italie
Lol, I feel for you, it's the same thing with France
When I said I was French in erasmus in Italy, they kept talking about Paris and their holidays there, although I had never visited it
I would think it's worse for England though, other cities are known only for football or the Beatles
Had to google this term and lmao
No I’m not but my partner sure is
We spend most of our summers in Quarteira just next to Vilamoura so I guess I’m an avec by proxy
I love your country, it’s one of the most beautiful and welcoming places in Europe
I had exactly the same experience in Zürich airport
Something like 10 CHF for two pieces of bread and some ridiculous ham in between
Esperanto
It was designed to be easy to learn, and it really is
Think about it, how much of language learning is memorizing conjugations, complicated rules and then exceptions to those rules, inconsistent spelling and pronunciations, etc
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a language that has none of those things
Well, it exists, and it’s called *Esperanto*. Estimates suggest that people could learn Esperanto five times faster than English
A neutral lingua franca would let everybody communicate on an even playing field
Right now, native anglophones have a big advantage in the world, at least in international industries
Do you want to be a scientist
Spend 5-10 years learning English first
[A 2005 study] suggested that adopting Esperanto as a lingua franca could save the EU 25 billion euros annually – not to mention that the current dominance of English contributes an estimated 17 billion to the UK economy every year
Think of all the time devoted to learning English in schools—we could learn *other* languages in that time, promoting linguistic and cultural diversity
Why is English so dominant anyways
The answer is obvious yet hard to admit for many people: the United States, and to a lesser extent, the UK
Two countries which are not in the EU
Through economic, cultural, and political/military dominance, the US has turned English into the global lingua franca, a fact which largely benefits anglophone countries
I’d rather have the EU show some cultural independence and not willingly surrender to English and American influence
Well lets think a little what kind of langage EU needs
You need a rational langage, so all southerns one are out
You need a langage pleasing to the hear so all Northern ones are out
So you end up with english and french
Now it's maybe only me, but I believe europe should be leader in quality and high standards, so I don't why we would choose the cheap version of french instead of the original
Obviously base
Reasons pro french : easy to learn for Spaniards, Italians and Romanians, gendered language like most of europeans languages and unlike english, and above all turning the EU into the ~~Third French Empire~~ the European Empire will finally make Europe politicaly relevant
Reasons against : weirdest of all the romance languages, words don't sound the way they are written, plenty of accent marks and making accidentaly a sexual innendo is very easy
Shouldn't. Because no one like us
Should
Because it used to be so it's tried and worked
Englsh is already there, we should just give up the ghost and stop slowing the process down
> Also, language nerds already love those Finno-Ugric grammar complexities and if everybody knows them, they become a lot less special
Couldn't agree more

Other argument: French is the language that [conveys information] the fastest
Sure, but it’s still easier than English or any other language (unless they’re like really closely related)
Simplicity and regularity go a long way
In any case, the question was about a language for Europe, not necessarily for the world
My thought exactly
We can express everything
>Are you guys taught about these things in school or was this just a happy coincidence
No I think it's more a cultural trait
The subject is easy banter
You just line up the usual supect and try to make sens out of stereotype
I mean the brit do it a lot too the only difference is that they actualy believe it
most of them still believe normand were not french but a superior race that arose out of thin air and gave birth to Churchill and Dr Who
Oh comon you have to hear sometime ! You do know the only reason Beethoven spoke German was because he was deaf
Just take Charle V advise on it :
"I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse
Now, I'm profondly invested in equal right and don't see why we should speak to women anymore in Italian, they're not as stupid as history believed them to be at the time but I sincerely don't feel like EU should rule or express herself on behalf of religion or horses
NOTE : The most perspicatious will notice the absence of english
But you got to understand, he was a wise man and well instructed and at the time patois and other créoles weren't yet considered like real langage
>Which is why you cant have a language that assigns genders to inanimate objects
On the contrary ! How else are you going to fight against patriarchal oppression and machism in langage if not by naming random thing by gender ! You can't deconstruct just to desconstruct that Nihilism
You need to construct deconstruction to deconstruct construction so that deconstruction constitute the new construct of deconstruction
I mean it's pretty basic and simple knowledge
So you either don't differentiate man and woman, or you do
and then apply it to all
that's just equality
EU is not an ancient regime under monarchie
Oh yeah, that's pretty comon worldwide, it's just bad taste but with a little education you can overcome it
In France we say: "C'est l'hôpital qui se fout de la charité" and I think it's beautiful ..
They even pretend English has more of a "latin" (meaning, from the Romans) influence instead of French, when half of their vocabulary is purely French
There's just gy and a (and maybe ty) but they're easy to master
Maybe, we don't know, we can't understand what those barbaric folks are saying

Napoleon invading Russia is one of the biggest mistake he made
Or maybe is  nephew  attacking Prussia in 1870
- 1812
But at least it created a cool music
Or 1870
Both were pretty stupid invasions

I need to thank you for your dedication to piss us off though, you really test our self-control almost every day
Spain would have probably shifted towards neutrality, the loss at Trafalgar was not only a huge blow to the morale but also made it really difficult for Spain to secure trade with its American colonies, putting the country's economy in a very weak position
People showed more and more resentment towards French troops stationed in France to blockade/invade Portugal, Manuel de Godoy who was the main figure in favor for a cooperation with Napoléon was then "forced into retirement" by an angry mob in favor for the heir of the throne
Now come the dick move, Napoléon came to Spain to mediate the power struggle between the king and his heir but just went "Fuck that, I already have troops in the country, now my brother is the new king
Just try me". And that's how a friendly country that just wanted to say that they're tired of this shit and want to get out of it became a guerilla nightmare, slowly draining Napoléon limited resources
Oh god
Absolutly not
Without Napoléon and his empire France would have been crushed by the others nations
Without Napoléon France would have been destroyed, a phantom state of thé Asburg
I don't give a shit about your inferiority complex
I don't feel morally superior, only a fool would be
>Truth hits the hardest, I guess
What truth ? From an event 75 years ago, when you and I weren't even born ? We declared war on Germany, a bit late, but we did, despite our numerous casualties in WWI, and we suffered our most shameful loss, destroying our military's reputation from a short event of 5 years over a span of a millennia of history
Not really no, as a man from Savoy, that's not what i call good management
And if they 're was no risk After that why do the powers in Europe pushed for the brother of the last King to step on the throne of France ?

6244501 here and it’s honestly not that bad
The sun sets around 16h30
You just get used to it
I plan my days accordingly
I like doing long walks for example, so during winter I do them around 13h so I am sure I can get as much sunlight as I can
(Those long walks help a lot !)
I live literally right on it, and the nice thing is that the summers have very long days where you can sit outside drinking beer until 10:30
I live at like 46 and I don't care, I like when it's dark more than when it's sunny
1871, after the 2nd French Empire ends, a National Assembly is elected
Monarchists are at a majority ; they want to restore the monarchy in France
So they go over to the lawful heir of the throne of France, and ask him to be the new king
He just has to say the word, they vote, and, boom, France is now a Kingdom again
Except the guy throws a tantrum : he won't accept if the tricolore (blue, white, red) flag remains
He wants the old white flag of the monarchy back
The thing is, everyone likes the tricolore flag
Even the previous king (Louis-Philippe) had choosen to keep it
But the guy is stubborn : white flag, take it or leave it, so negociations end up bogged down
Republicans then get the majority of seats in the following election, and France goes on to become a long-term republic, and (likely) never again a kingdom
&#x200B;
The kind of thing that have exactly zero valid reason to happen, and yet do happen
Dude saw the 1871 mess in Paris and came out with the lamest excuse to dodge that bullet, expecting it to happen again maybe ?
Wich is a shame because imho d'Artois would have been a good king, he had a great mindset and was aware of the new social issues brought by the industrial era
it was just a small bite
It was the same year Paris lost its collective shit and tried to become an independant city-state and turn the rest of the country into a loose federation of similar city-states
Take a wild guess about their potential reaction to the monarchy
We changed political regimes like 8 times in a century, at this point what was even supposed to be good or bad man
Yeah we got a nice demonstration of how monarchies are a healthy thing in 1914
I mean he grew up on exile after Louis-Philippe "stole" is crown, he grew up with the white flag of the Bourbon dynasty in their bagage
Also a little context : after the collapse of the First Empire, the Bourbons return in France, they are the two young brothers of Louis XVI
The first one Louis XVIII, despite being mocked for his obesity was smart and had a good political sense so while the old white flag is back he knows how to balance the legacy of the revolution and the one of the monarchy, so it's overall a peaceful period with good ministers
He dies in 1824 and the last brother, Charles X comes in charge
He is way more naive than Louis XVIII and keep the memorie of his elder brother Louis XVI being executed despite accepting compromises and whatever the revolutionnaries asked him, so he has a more authoritarian rule and refuse the legacy of the revolution
Charles X is the grandfather of Henri d'Artois
In 1830 a parisian revolt starts, Charles X knows the most popular of the Bourbons is not his son but his grandson Henri d'Artois so he gives the crown to his son, who became Louis XIX for 20 minutes, and then to Henri d'Artois
But Louis-Philippe d'Orleans who is in charge after the abdication of Charles X and was charged to organised the succession to Henri d'Artois just keep the crown for himself and starts the Monarchy of July
The Bourbons starts their exile and go in Austria then later in UK
So, when after the collapse of the IInd Empire Henri d'Artois is the last Bourbons and claim the throne, he say this famous sentence about the white flag : "I received the white flag as a sacred deposit, from the old king my grandfather
He floated on my cradle, I want him to shade my grave
I think he had a great mindset because he was slightly socialist, wanted genuinely to be close to the people and all of that while wanting a no-liberal monarchy
And when he was in Paris after the collapse of the IInd empire he declined the proposal of several generals to just march their armies into the city and put him in charge directly, he wanted no blood splitted for him whatsoever even if he cost him the crown
I was working with German collegues years ago, I had to fly to Munich every month to spend a couple of days there, so we were using the company canteen for lunch
I do not speak German at all, but well, I know a few very basic words like hello thank you goodbye, the very very basic
So well, in a canteen, you only need to say hello, mention the food you want, say thank you and that's it
The plate names were written down so here again, you know how to read german, you can name the food
No special skills here
So I ordered my food, and my colleagues then told me, hold on, you said you can't speak german
It seems my pronounciation was not too far off and I ordered in an enough natural way to fool them
I was proud of myself
Not a word but catalan speakers are always thrilled when I say a few words in their language
Sometimes when writing in English online I get comments on how "fancy" my vocabulary is, but it's just because when 2 synonyms of a word exist I tend to think of the one of French origin first
You just shattered down my illusion of having a decent german accent
/Jk
Yes german have "harsher" pronunciation, if that makes sense, and also make "back of the mouth" sounds like the B for instance, while in French we do more "front of the mouth" sounds
I am no expert here and my language classes are far far away now
But don't worry, it has its charm, I still have fond memories of a german fellow student who melted my heart when she was speaking French
Well she was not ugly either, that propably helped
Outch !
Yes, definitely a winner
Gotta love Lyon
I feel like decades' worth of clichés regarding a certain box-shaped musical instrument with keys and the city of Paris answer this question without one even needing to say anything
This is similar to the premise of the Michael Moore movie, "Where to invade next

Our health care system (and our bread) (France)
It's ok to be up to 15 minutes late for everything
I think it would be best if we don't give anything
I get annoyed having to kneel down to brush my teeth though, that's my only problem with bidets
Edit: thank you kind person for the very nice award
As a french living in Germany I honestly believe that the French Healthcare is better
Explique-toi
Il y a rien qui me vient quand j'essaie d'imaginer un trait ou une caractéristique générale des français qui soit clairement considérée comme positive ET où on est clairement meilleurs que les autres européens
Je vaux pas dire qu'on est mauvais partout, hein
La plupart des trucs bien c'est de la bouffe, de l'art, des monuments, etc
mais ça compte pas vraiment pour cette question
Après il y a probablement un truc auquel j'ai pas pensé.
I was stopped by the police in Czechia for jaywalking
They didn't fine me, as the younger one said it was close to Christmas, so they'd let me go
Bah ça n'empêche pas ni les Italiens, ni les Allemands, entres autres, de mettre en avant la gastronomie
Et justement
en parlant de cette dernière, c'est clairement notre spécialité, la mode également, notre sens de la diplomacie aussi
Comme l'on dit certains, c'est aussi notre résilience, notre combativité face à l'autorité, ce qui me paraît important dans une démocratie
La fierté aussi, ce qui nous protège de la vanité, et de vouloir sans cesse nous comparer aux autres, le savoir-vivre, le savoir-faire
Il y a tant de choses à dire
in French :
* Maman poule (chicken mother)
* Papa Gateau (Cake father)
Same in French: mère poule
we Also says that those parents "n'ont pas/n'arrivent pasa couper le cordon" => "they didn't/can't cut the  umbilical cord "
I probably never visited half the monuments and museums in Paris
It's just too full of tourists
Really the only times I went to the Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Coeur is when people came to visit me
It happened to me plenty of times, in different cities
The idea behind is that I have plenty of time to visit because I'm living so close, or I'm waiting for a friend to visit it with me
This is a bit stupid because I always regret not visiting enough once I leave
I’m in Paris, never been to Disney land
I don’t really want to go, either
I remember telling a bunch of English kids once (they asked if I’d been there) & they all looked like I murdered their mom or something
It’s a saying that most Parisians have never been up the Eiffel Tower, but I did go there years ago :)
I live not far from Versailles
I remember when I was little why we never went to the palace even though we lived next to it !
Not "never" but there is only 3 valid reasons to climb the Eiffel Tower as a genuine Paris inhabitant : you're a small child, you have a small child, you have a tourist friend
We have hundreds and hundreds of places that only tourists go to lol
In Parisian region we all live at maximum 1H from any monument here, still never gave a shit about them plus there is always way too much tourists
If you ever go, I would recommend trying to pick a time without tourists because the path around Stonehenge isn't super large and it can get crowded quickly
I went to the one in Zagreb last week ! It's kinda cool
It's funny, I've lived close to Paris most of my life and I've never heard of it before a Canadian friend told me about it
It looks super interesting
Definitely a go-to when it's possible
In French we say "Y", pronounced as "i-grec", meaning Greek i (that's just how the letter is called)
Un i-grec deux i-grec trois
EDIT It seems that it's just me who does that XD
In drivers school in order to evaluate the distance with the car in front of you, you need to leaves two seconds between you and them
You spot a mark on the road (end of a line, tree, exit) and you say out loud une-euh seuh-con-deuh - deux -seuh-con-deuh (you spell out exaggerating all the sounds in une seconde deux se conde)
My gramp used "un ti ta deux ti ta trois ti ta" which is slightly shirter than a second but still useful
I do that too
Same here, I was looking for my fellow Frenchmen to discover how we do this in French, sadly I've never heard of "elephants" / "Mississippi" tricks
Sorry about that I just edited, for some reasons reddit disclosed what I've previously written and just sent the message as " tricks ".
That's funny, I've never heard that
I use "Mississippi" or "crocodile"
C'est pas pour les distances de sécurité en voiture ?
Never ever heard that
I usually go with 1, 1 et demi, 1 trois-quarts (1, 1 and a half, 1 and three quarters)
Same in France, I'm so surprised it seems to be a common thing everywhere else because I don't really see the point
> I have the feeling it has been made popular by driving lessons
Yes that's where I learned it too
I use crocodile too
Some people also use "hippopotame".
"Hélicoptère", too
Oui exactement c'est ma monitrice d'auto école qui me disait de compter comme ça. On avait peut être la même xD
I my own specific case, we use it professionally when timing actions on movie sets or when decomposing a scene during rehearsals
Usually we agree on a "unit" beforehand
The most common being "éléphants".
1 éléphants ... 2 éléphants ... 3 éléphants ... eeeet ACTION !
A master in computer sciences, in physics, statistics, engeniering in general and some cultural diploma are the best qualifications in France, in my opinion
That might sound like a joke, but providing you can pay for them, private economic schools might be the best here in France
Masturbate/party through your studies, network enough while partying, get in a high-salary position in a big bank because network, and continue down the party/network lane
Main drawback: if you fail at networking, you're in deep shit as that school ain't paying itself
Diplôme d'ingénieur from a Grande école
Pompous stem diploma from pompous mini universities
If you want to get a job, don't go to a university
Agricultural sciences are a safe degree to follow; near 99% employment rate in the months following getting your degree in France for the good schools
I don't mean don't get any type of higher education but here the "best" options are engineering schools for instance, which is not university
Only highly valued options that are in fact university are law and medicine
Actually good  bread
I'm from the North East of France
There, like Belgium and the Netherlands I believe, we go out for Mardi gras (carnaval) as kids dresses up and knock on doors singing
We get candy
Fairly similar to what some do for Halloween but at another time of year
What I didn't realise was that it's not something every area in France does
So already made a fool of myself mentioning this at my new job
Happens here too
It's usually 25 years off as well
>The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
We have that in France, it's le goûter; some think it's mostly for kids but I find it's really needed if you have lunch at 12 and dinner at 8pm
Hummmm Mexicano and Fricandelle
Hadn't had one of those in many years
(probably for the best but still
That sounds amazing
Hahahahahaahahahahaha

The true secret : The Berlin wall was made of german bread since the beginning
France
Sure people look at us now as harmless people who surrender often and prefer to spend their time drinking wine and eating our delicious cheese with baguettes while flirting with pretty tourists
but we've done quite a few bad things in our past
I'd say Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Liechenstein
They are filthy rich because of foreign industries settling down there in order to pay less or no taxes
It's some sort of piracy if you ask me
I think in GENERAL, we and the British catch way less flak than we deserve due to the Germans very generous (in regards to our reputation) actions in the 20th century
Recently that feels to be somewhat changing but still especially on Reddit I feel like Americans are much more critical of themselves, and their current administration, to be focusing on us, when in reality we are doing probably equally immoral things with a little bit more class, protester suppressing aside
France is considered to be in the top 5 of the most powerful military forces, and also has baguettes
Yeah what triggers me most about the surrender jokes is that it seems to ignore the fact we're meanies
We would like a word
Heh, overachievers :p
I enjoy them (especially the 15cm scissor) but they are not so popular
We can buy them mostly in haberdashery or hardware store, so i guess people use them for handiwork or sewing
If the 1812 French Empire was reunited today, how would it affect/change your country
The country would be bigger
Pardon, le pays serait plus gros
Les anglos ne dominent plus !
It would, for the best
Napoléon a conquéri plus de territoires que je ne le pensais
It would have the benefit of finally bringing some fucking order to things
Our country would become an empire
Our protest will look more like a global revolution
This time we won't invade Russia during the winter
Damn let's be honest that's the single one post where I got the most comments ever
Love talking with y'all guys !
Edit: Jesus christ my phone just keeps notyfing me of comments I've had more than 100 notifications yet chill out x)
It would be
Interesting
You're croatian if I'm not mistaken
Yeah most of Croatia was French at the time
What's the Konjin
Et merde, on est repartis !
Yeah I guess you're right lol
Yeah he didn't manage to conquer Russia in the end
You would have a government for once
Tbh I do think we wouldn't invade, more diplomatically annex Switzerland
Like seriously mate your while country is both a remote bomb and a giant fortress
Prepare for
BAGUETTE !!
"Remember 1942
Ok good, can you give us back Koeinsberg
Come on, don't be a bitch about it !"
Certainely would, my friend

Wow, didn't think spanish were willing to assimilate so much to french culture !
We would take Catalonia from a country that doesn't respect refeundums of independancy*
Where you from
Yup
During
Napoleon sold Louisiana to the british after we too it back
Possible small wooosh here, it was actually what his sentence was joking about
>but the French rule is remembered in a positive way
That kinda surprises me, how was French rule good for the region
Ouch
Nay I don't celebrate colonialism
We simply, as French, would rejoice seeing a competent and strong leader in our Government
Napoléon is seen as a strong positive leader in France
(also points missiles) tu vas faire quoi
That's definitely not the case in my own experience, nor anyone I know of
The France I know has a neutral view on Napoleon: not a negative one, but it ain't positive either
That's at least the consensus I've seen when it was discussed in Reddit before
Also people in real life I know agree
Maybe it's a generational thing
(Points at Buger) so will we !
(Points Lafayette and de Grasse) come back, they don't need you not the French support
They'll handle the Royal Navy themselves
Isn't kind of the point of a War
To kill your ennemies
I see
Indeed what you say was true
Schools have not been closed since the first lockdown ended here (we close classes when there are three -now one- covid positive people among the class’s students), but universities have & their students are having a hard time
Depression rates are rising, people are dropping out of university, those who were preparing for a thesis have a hard time accessing libraries for their research
it’s not good
The first lockdown was bad because all schools were closed & some people can’t afford to have a computer for online class, some students don’t have a place at home where they’re away from both siblings and parents to work quietly, etc
When it comes to giving people equal chances in life (thanks to school), lockdown is a disaster
I believe there will be consequences
People want schools closed at the moment
Also, I’m a student not a teacher (hope that’s ok)
Schools have been open since September but if they dare to close them I won't attend classes anymore
The only reason I'm happy to go to school is to see my friends, I'm fed up with those shitty classes
I get back in the bar
If I’m rich, I order French fries there and then, but otherwise the 1:00+ am kebab is the way to go :)
It's too early, would probably go back in
Around 1am a crepe with eggs, ham, potatoes, molten cheese, salad
Might replace ham+cheese by salmon and some kind of parsley sauce
God bless that crepe guy
The next morning I will realize I had the calories equivalent of 3 meals between my dinner, the beers and said crepe and will look my beer belly with disappointment and tell myself next time I'll drink whiskey instead, somehow it doesn't make me hungry
It's funny I don't really have a spanish building that comes in my mind directly
Among those 3 the most popular is probably la Sagrada Familia
For a huge share of us it would be your football stadiums though
The Colosseum (Colisée in french) and the tower of Pisa are the buildings that define your country for me
I had the Reichstag in mind too
De szép
Not a building but the mattehorn would do it for me
It's not a building but what compares the most to the eiffel tower in Switzerland is le jet d'eau in Genève
It's also probably because we don't know much about german speaking Switzerland
I have no idea about this tower
For me, for  Portugal, it is not a place but it would be the azulejos
The little mermaid *has* to be the landmark of Denmark
Wow, looks like a Ufo
A dark force ufo
An Alfa Romeo in a nutshell, beautiful but poorly built
At least in the past
I visited the Atomium years and years ago, there was an exhibition inside, I can't remember what it was about, but it was looking so old and in bad shape
I hope they upgraded it meanwhile because it was truly underwhelming
I concur
Le jet d'eau on Leman lake is for me the iconic manmade landmark of Switzerland
The weather station I think I saw it on movies
Was there a James Bond movie showcasing the weather station
I agree with the Stave churches
This is Norway to me, as far as man made structures are concerned
(From an American living in France) There's a different trend in bike styles between Europe and the US
In Europe, I see a lot more city/utility-style bikes, with a more comfortable upright posture, often with baskets and bells
In the US, I see a lot more road bikes, even in big cities
It could be due to functional differences (more cobblestones in Europe, bigger distances in US), but I think there's a style element too: sleek, minimalist road bikes are fashionable in the US, and upright bikes are seen as bulky
Yeah the french/spanish term of all-terrain bike is far more appropriated
Both here and in the US (Chicago), I don't commute daily by bike, but I would ride for other reasons (go to the park, a friend's house, the store, etc
I usually take public transportation, but sometimes biking is faster, or I just feel like biking
The first time I rode in the street with cars, it was a little nerve-wracking, but I got used to it after a few times
You have to be aware, signal your turns, look before you turn, get comfortable joining in the car traffic when you have to, and get familiar with which streets are good and bad for biking,
Actually, the main divide here is not US vs
Europe, but rural/suburban vs
city biking
And if we're talking about city biking, it's actually way easier in Europe than in the US
There are more bike lanes, city centers have fewer and slower cars, and drivers are much more aware and accommodating of cyclists because there are just more of them
So, if you can bike in an American city, than you can easily bike in an European city
Even if you've never city-biked, you would probably feel fine biking in many European cities
Edit: spelling
We Europeans are gentlemen unlike the Americans
Pretty reductive way to judge a continent but just as ignorant as many europeans are about other parts of the world so fair enough
[Fortunately your priest was wrong
> basashi
Kumamoto
The best time I had in Japan
Basashi is not that good, but everything else was fantastic
Pretty sure most europeans would have trouble giving the names of 10 african countries
My question is why shouldn't they
Today we have more access to information than ever before, wouldn't it be a shame not to take advantage of this to be informed about the world
I consider it to be basic general knowledge anyone should have, it's just an example among others
I mean, ever since we « gained freedom » from the Roman Empire ?
There were short periods here and there of military occupation, but it doesn't really count
It's not like the state was abolished
I guess some people would count the Hundred Years War as partial « English occupation », but to me it's always been more of a series of French civil wars than anything else
And the State was still around anyhow
That reminds me of a talk I had years ago with an Argentinian on July 14
He told me « ah yeah, it's your independence day ». I stood baffled for a few second as the thought of France having an independence day was so incredibly strange and unexpected
Needs definition of country and after that Freedom
Anyway I'll go with the to main french aswers :
"Le liberté est choix" - Sartre
From 476/843 to today, with 4 years of occupation by the nazis between 1940 and 1944
We were occupied until 1789 by filthy royals but then guillotine happened
Then we had a restauration of kings from 1815 to 1848, but again we got rid of them at the end
We also got occupied by Nazis from 1940 to 1945
Same here, I think .
you can had the fivision of France just after the napoleonic war (in 1815), then
Because for us, Germany and Italy did'nt fully invade us either, we still had part free, ans the Vicky government, was more free than others pupets
Germany occupied all of France in 1942
The "free zone" was only a thing for 2 years
Execpt on overseas level
What
Paris is the core of a 12 million people metropolitan area and doesn't look like the movie Amélie Poulain
People actually live there

Las Vegas
Absolute soulless shithole
No culture, no vibe
Only money is something here
À 2$ watch pretending to be a Rolex
Vilnius and Warsaw
I prefer Krakow and Riga !
Well, I'm sorry to break it to you but
Valencia made a much better impression on me than Barcelona
> Braşov
I loved it though
It's lovely and it's pretty nice to go hiking around
Also I ate my first kürtoskalacs on the central square
Irish fans left a very good impression I must say
Not onlyin Paris
Lol
Paris was dirty af in the 60s and 70s. Cars were [everywhere] Buildings were [black with soot] There were [literal slums] all around the city
It got better not worse
Thank you, I didn't get insulted enough today
So basically you went to Paris in 2017, went to shitholes, took the RER A and ate at bad restaurants, got it
I liked it when I visited a few years ago, it didn't feel like such a shithole tbh
Plus, *boulets*, *pékèt* and good beer
Amen brother, cheers from Irak
If i asked for the cheapest shot in the bar, the barman would ask for my ID and refuse to sell me a shot
I don't know why though
If your goal is getting drunk, it can (should) be a factor
That would be the rational choice
Not sure about the whole curriculum, but my 11 year old son is being taught right now about the birth of writing which includes Sumurian, Egyptian and Greek civilisations
He's been taught about Romans too
I remember some words about Mesopotamia, then it's mostly Rome and Greece during classical era
There's some Ancient Egypt too I think ?
The letter itself is pronounced \aʃ\, ash
The h is silent in French, but it affects pronunciation nonetheless: an initial h is supposed to prevent [liason] & [elision] ; but as usual with French, there are a lot of exceptions
It's silent but it changes the pronounciation of the letter that is before it, e.g. ch sounds like sh
I always thought the exceptions were based on the origin of the word
If from latin, then you can make a liaison, if not, then you don't.
The presence of the letter "h" directly behind the letter "c" creates the phoneme "ch" which is pronounced like the sound "sh" in English
I have seen the word "ihminen" said with sometimes a /ç/ and some other times a /x/, so I'm getting a but confused
That is indeed the case most of the time; but there are many exceptions, and the etymology of many words is not obvious immediately
Oh stop it you
No, ash is the right way to say it
[Pronunciation here]
The English word "ash" is basically pronounced like the letter H is in French (or the French word "hache" for that matter)
ash is /æʃ/ in English; æ doesn't exist in France French, except in some dialects
But the French /a/ is closer approximation to the English /æ/ than the /ʌ/ of ush
Look, I don't know what to tell you
The sound a French person makes when saying the letter H, as in reciting the alphabet is the same sound an English speaker makes when saying the word ash
The sentence you mentioned is not counterindicative at all
Edit: I guess you mean the a is longer in English
If so, then sure I guess
As much as I can see how "ash" is not exactly pronounced like "hache" (which is really how the letter H is pronounced, at least with a northern city accent) because the a sound in ash is longer I strongly disagree that the first syllable in "usher" is closer
It just isn't, there is an "a" sound when we say the letter H.
Well, I guess when you put it like that, sure
I don't know, I feel like you're saying "ash" with an American accent or something, but maybe it's me who imagines "ash" said in such a way that English speakers don't actually do
As for usher
it's so strange to me
I'll concede that your recording is convincing
again, maybe how "usher" sounds in my head is different than how it's actually pronounced, idk
I mean I have no particular interest in some of them, but not to that extent
If I had time and money, I would visit them all
None ! they all seem to be very interesting
Well, I've already visited many European countries: France, Belgium, Netherland, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovinia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Italy, Vatican, Monaco, Spain and Portugal + some overseas EU areas like Martinique, Guadeloupe and Canarias
(and of course many non-European countries)
I just wanted to show off on my travel experience
Honestly I'll like to visit more of Eastern Europe (Czech Rep
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria
), Iceland also (I guess it's a place to visit at least once in your life), maybe Istanbul as well
I think I'll also like to visit St Petersburg
There is no countries that I'll never consider visiting
There aren't any that I would never consider but some I don't really care about and we don't particularly have a good (or bad) opinion of, I just don't really care about south eastern Europe that much, except maybe Greece
Mind you I don't mean this to be derogatory towards those countries or people from there, it's more a question of my own ignorance
France once I get out of there
I'm honestly scared of my home country at times
I've lived in Nice and so Monaco is really close
To me the only attraction of Monaco is the Oceanographic Museum
The building is beautiful, facing the Mediterranean and the museum is full of relics, sea animals conserved in Formol, old scientific drawings of animals, and it has a nice aquarium (the Aquarium isn't the best I've seen, it's the Museum part that is more exceptional)
But then it's only worth going there if you have interest in marine life and museum
However if you're on a trip in the Côte D'Azur, on your way from Nice to Menton, it's worth taking a break at this museum for like 2h!
I think that Paris is still better than London tho
We are experts in this matter
Let me help you
I'm living up to my stereotype
If you'd ask me, Dunkirk is the best city in Europe
but I might be biased as well
Come come
To refer to a place far away, do you use the name of an imaginary place and/or real place ?
In French it's common to use *Pétaouchnok*, name of an imaginary town or island far far away
*Perpètes-les-oies*, from *Perpètes* slang for far away or long ago and *les oies*, ~~swans~~ geese, to give it a more rural feel
*Bab El Oued*, a town somewhere in Algeria
Oies = geese (goose singular) not swan :)
I've also heard "Veracruz" and "Ouagadougou" (capital of Burkina Faso) used to refer to faraway places a few times
I'm French and I absolutely don't know "Pétaouchnok", I only know "Perpètes".
We also use Tataouine (a town in Tunisia)
Oh right
"So, what's the name of your current king ? "
Dude
Guillotine Ier ?
She meant mostly cheese and bread, don't be offended
We really like food from elsewhere, it's just frustrating as a French to travel and never find proper cheese or baguette
For exemple, I know the Auchan along the mediterranean sea (in other countries than France ofc) are considered a haven by the sailing community, because they have usually the best food amongst the small costal harbors supermarket
We have probably emptied our stock
It did, and it was rightly seen as a tragedy
Now, as to the reason why it hasn’t got as much media coverage as the NZ shooting (because I’ve been getting frustrated at posts in certain other subreddits purporting that evil Europeans just don’t care about the lives of people who don’t live in the first world)
School shootings are seen as less motivated than killing a bunch of muslims in a mosque
They’re just less ideological
The NZ shooter basically parrotted all alt-right talking points that you find on subs like thedonald (so it’s no surprise that they’re actively defending him)
From what i remembered
If you are being attack, you can defend yourself with the same level or less, exemple, if you are in a fight with a knife, a gun is judge to be more powerful, so you can't use it
You cant use a knife in a fist fight, ect
Some sportsmen can't use their knowledge because of the risk they represent to the other person
And of course, having a weapon in the street is illegal, you can't even bring a fake gun if it's looking like a real one (and you need a licence to buy it (depend of the kind of fake gun))
Loosely related, but: here (France) you are supposed to act if someone close to you is being harmed
Those people who filmed George Floyd’s death
They would have been tried, here, for "non assistance à personne en danger" (not helping someone in harms way)
Because the law says that they _have_ to help in such a situation
(Well, the police thing makes it a bit complicated, but I’m pretty sure it still works
It’s not self defense, but I thought you might be interested since it’s... collective defense
Sort of
IIRC there are 3 conditions :
-proportionality as you said : for exemple a man was harassing a woman she took her high hells and pierced his eye, it was judged disproportionate
The proportionality is judged based on the consequences and not the act by itself
Also the proportionality is judged more strictly if it's to protect a property and not a person
-necessity : you have to protect someone/sth by doing the act if it's a vengeance it's not a necessity, if running can save you it's the same
-the act and the reaction must be at the same time : it's a condition that's linked with the last one
We consider that if the act is already done and the aggressor has left it's the police's job and not the victim's job to make him pay
It's been quite a long time so someone may correct me if I'm wrong
There is one exception to the second rule : if you are attacked at night in your home (domicile principal) there is no requirement to run away
I'd like to add that the legitimate defence is an affirmative claim meaning that you have to prove that the use of force was legal to avoid punishment
Except, once again, in the case where it happened at night in your home then the prosecution has to prove that your use of force was not legitimate
It would most likely not
There is _one_ case that has been in court for years, and the dead guy had pre-existing conditions according to a first autopsy
The problem is, the second autopsy’s results were different
But that’s one (still very sad) case in years
Thanks for the great precisions, to add to the end one of the tricky situations is related to traps : is your trap positioned at a height that shows your intent to kill or to a reasonable height to wound
Do you have a military police doing the police job in rural areas ?
In France there is the Nationale Police ( Police Nationale ) for the cities and a military police ( Gendarmerie ) for countryside and rural areas
They have [very recognizable cars] in dark blue with flashy yellow stripes and overall they are way more respected and liked than the regular police
Who is doing the police stuff in your countryside ?
Yes, it is called "Gendarmerie" (Men in arms)
They tend to be closer to people, more helpful
They are more appreciated than regular Police
I never understood why you have so many police forces
Is there a difference in how they are perceived by the population
Why
They have about the same as we do (fewer actually, since they don't have municipal police forces)
The main difference is that their guardia di finanza have a wider jurisdiction than our douane
Gendarme comes from "Gens d'armes" which means "armed people" in French
In the same city you can see the municipale, la polizia, and the carabinieri
It is a bit confusing
Good to know
Very different from France
I don't think there is *such* a shift in citizen's views on police and gendarmerie
You should leave your cave from time to time
And you shouldn't be passive/aggressive at all
Excuse me for not having read an articles on the matter
I wasn't stating a truth, just a feeling/opinion based on what I see
But thanks anyway, it was an interesting article
There has been protests against police violence for months
That's objective, not passive agressive
And in my head the gendarmerie was also a part of those protest
First because the gendarmerie is often a part of protest's suppression
And even though, yes, they are less violent than the police, they aren't perfect for all that
And also because I think that for a lot of people, police nowadays is a word that represents all the law-enforcement
Because I actually have been following all the protests against the police
It is actually one of the thing I've been the most interested in and disgusted by at the same time for the last 4 years
I also am very very sad that I couldn't watched "Un Pays Qui Se Tient Sage" before theatres were closed again
So, yes I think you were being passive aggressive
Whether it was an objective observation
And yes, my view on those two different trade certainly was blurred
Because if the gendarmerie isn't as rottent as the police it should be said and praised
But I still think that the authority they represent isn't liked either
Because it's not because they aren't the police now, that they can't and won't be
Also, I'm very much sorry if I, myself, sound passive/aggressive
That's really not what I'm trying to do
Have a good evening and a great end of your weekend :D
Which words in your language have a very special story
Like those in description
For example
The word for fox in french :
Renard has a very special story as it was first in middle age a first name like Louis or Pierre
The name for a fox was goupil back then
Then a kid story became very popular about a "goupil" called Renart, it became so popular that people began to call all fox Renard, and then the first name became the name of the animal
Goupil doesn't mean anything now in french but we can find the word in other word like Bottle brush which is "goupillon" as it seems like a fox tail or the world "goupiller" which means something like "have suspicious activity" as fox are seen as clever and cunning
The word today (you probably heard about it):
Today in french is "aujourd'hui", which is a strange word with a ' in the middle
It's because at first hui meaned today
People being french they love complicated ways ( we are the people who use "four twenty ten" for ninety ) so they always said "on the day of today" which was  "au jour d'hui", and it became aujourd'hui ! So now if you say "on the day of today" in french you basically say something like "on the day of the day of today" !
Edit:
World -> Word
Renard (name of the character) -> Renart
In Esperanto, there is a verb "kabei" which means to leave the Esperantist movement
It is based on the pseudonym of Kazimierz Bein, Kabe, who was a famous Esperantist who was super involved in the movement and suddenly left and cut ties with the movement
Just a little correction: The goupil was called "Renar*t*" in *Le Roman de Renart* (12th century)
And indeed I've heard people saying "au jour d'aujourd'hui" which means "on the day of the day of today", but they don't even notice it, this became pretty common
Már láttam tegnap egy másik subredditen de még érdekesebb
I think the author was talking about a story whoch is called "Le roman de renart". It was not really a book as stories were added by unkown authors
It was basically folklore
I do not remember when it all started and whever some of them where translated abroad, but it would be worth diging
I didn't know the story existed in other countries, very interesting
You are right this is not a kid story, I made this mistake because when I was in school, we used to read an adaptation of this story for kids, bit the original version is as you said more an epic story
Thanks for the correction ! I should have verified the spelling beforehand
This one is funny ahah
In french we have a similar word: démerder, which has exactly the same root (merde=shit, dé like UNmake ) but it means "do it by yourself" or "taking yourself out of trouble"
Thanks, I corrected it
Well, in schools years you learn about the big events, and sometimes really summarized, then you personally learn two things: Detailled country history, and Detailled local History
This might seem weird to an american, but in europe there can be a Completely differents approach and/or events within 50km of distance (30/35 Miles)
An example is in my homeland, Southeast of France
Nice and Provence were totally different countries, and even fought each other
The Provencial history is strongly attached to France, While Nice's history is strongly attached to Italy's. But to give you an Idea, I lived 70km away from Nice, and am far in Provence
If you take a larger scale, the differences within a same countries are insane
Scottish POV and Northen Irish are so different, same for Bretagne's and Alsace in France, or Catalogna and Andalousia in Spain
History is very, very complex in europe, and if you want to know everything, well you learn it by yourself or you don't. And yet, I am really passionate about history, but I don't have a clue about Poland's History for example, through we are on the same Continent/Union
Skip stuff
Two reasons:
Countries do not unite, even if they have the same monarch
Elisabeth II is queen of both Canada and England, yet they are two different countries
Marrying the monarch of a country does not make you ruler of that country but "queen consort / consort". For instance, the Queen of England is Elisabeth II, and her husband is her consort (and also "prince of Greece and Denmark" - but he was born with that title, and, similarly, Elisabeth II did not gain that title when she married him)
Theoretically, the last year of high school is the year you turn 18
So you start university at 18 (or 17 if you are born late in the year)
How many years do you have
It's 12 for us, I thought it was the most common
Maybe we start elementary school at a different time
It's supposed to be at 6 but if you are born between September and December you'll start it at 5
So maybe in other countries it's "you are already 6 so you start school" and not "you'll be 6 this year"?
In France we have 3 (optionnal) years pre elementary school, 5 years of elementary school, 4 years of middle school and 3 years of high school
That's the difference then, we do 5 years, 4 years, and 3 years
But I think you also have shorter days and shorter vacation
We have way too long days (often had 8:00 - 18:00 in high school) and longer vacation
For France, assuming you're going all the end to high school degree (and not going the apprenticeship way at the end of middle school), it's :
- 3 years of kindergarten (École maternelle), ages 2/3 to 5/6
- 5 years of elementary school (École primaire) ages 6/7 to 10/11
- 4 years of middle school (Collège), ages 11/12 to 14/15
- 3 years of high school (Lycée), ages 15/16 to 17/18
Didn't the maternelle years became mandatory during Macron's mandate
Metz -> Mettis -> Mediomatrici, the celtic tribe which ruled the area and had its oppidum on what is nowadays the historical center of the city (for info, this neighborhood hosts the city museum which is directly built on the roman thermae
They’re included to the exhibition and it’s pretty impressive
I currently live in Nancy for my studies; the town was firstly built around 664, and its name come from the Celtic word "Nant", meaning swamp, as the town was built on the shores of the Meurth in the middle of marshy plains
Now there’s hardly a swamp around but there is still remnants of it
My hometown Miribel means in Latin Jolie vue or nice view, because there is a nice view up the hill over the town and the Rhône Valley
Lyon comes from latin Lugdunum, the name of the city changed with the language
I don't know where Lugdunum comes from though
I live in Nantes
It apparently comes from the latin name "Portus Namnetes", which means the harbor of the Namnetes
The Namnetes were the tribes that lived here during the Roman Empire
Or from the King Namnès who founded the city, it's not sure
Another possibility is that it comes from "nanto" which means valley or river in latin (the biggest river in France, the Loire, goes through the city)
[My source (in french)]
My hometown is Le Vésinet in France, it comes from latin Visiniolum which means "neighbouring place" because
Well i guess its because its neighbouring other places
Lyon, France:
Come from the old Latin name of the city: *Lugdunum* wich became l*ugdon*, then *luon* then *Lyon*
Before that, we have several hypotheses about "*Lugdunum*" 's origin:
\- From the celtic words  *lougounos* (raven) and *dounon* (high place) because the city have 2 hills
\- From  *Dunum* (hills) and  *Lug* (light)
\- From *Lugus/Lug* (a local celtic god) and  *duno* (fortress)
Marseille originates from latin Massilia / Greek Massalia (Μασσαλία)
Marseille is an ancient Greek colony in the middle of ligurian tribes territory of what is now South-East France
The city was founded in 600 bc by Greek settlers from Phocaea
For this reason in French, Marseille is sometimes called la cité Phocéenne (the Phocaeaian city)
I grew up in Amiens in the north of France, the name comes from the gallic tribe that lived which was called Ambiani
I now live in Lyon and there is no certitude
It was invaded and renamed Lugudunum, it then became Lugdon and then Luon and then Lyon
No one really knows what Lugudunum meant though
A Celtic tribe lived here, and my town's name comes from the tribe's name
As for the village of my childhood, the origin is not well-known and it could either come from "land,' "ground," "fertile ground," or "ground that brings in a certain amount of money (could come from the word used to mean money) per year," or even the Gaullic word for "rock"
My hometown is the city of Lorient in Brittany, its name comes from the fact it was a trade harbour made especially for the French East India Company by Louis XIV's will ( compagnie des Indes orientales ) and so their heavy ships could bring in Europe goods from trading with eastern world
And in french one word to describe the East is also "L'Orient", so eventually the city developping around the harbor took the name of "Lorient" through the years
Fun fact, the area was chosen because an old citadel made by the spanish when they landed a force in Britanny in 1591 could have total control of the harbour's entry
Today this citadel is famous for being a museum of the french east india company
Reims comes from the celtic tribe that lived here during the Conquest of the Gaule by Julius Ceasar
They were the *Rems* and were one of the most important tribe of the region
If I remember correctly they were one of the only tribe to actualy like the Romans and cooperate while all the other tribes tried to resist
I'm gonna put Bordeaux here since it's kind of the same origin: first known as burdigala
Burd means muddy and cal means Shelter
The city was build on a plateau next to the Garonne River and was surrounded by marshes (that don't really exist anymore)
Lug is a celtic god and dunum means fortress, so the Fortress of lug
It's not unfortunately
The ruins of the castle got destroyed to build a 30m statue of Marie
The view from up there is beautiful though
In the good days (when diffraction is not too bad and we have a good visibility), you can see all of the eastern Alps, including the Mont Blanc, that is pretty singular by its shape
This meaning comes from the colour of the Bordeaux wines
The city lies something like 30 km from the coast, but the River is already quite large at this point, the estuary being only a few km away
It's also still influenced by the tide and the city and surrounding areas is crisscrossed by a series of smaller rivers, called "estay" , the level of which varies with the tide
So yeah, one Can make this assumption, me included before i checked the wikipedia page (it also has a breakdown of the évolution of the name if you're intéressed)
Londunum :)
You just made me realize how close both étymologies are, lugdunum and londunum
In french : Rrrrrrrr
Verb is "ronroner"
The noise is “ronron” though not just “rrrr”
Not going to argue with u. But we use the word ronron but when we do the noise it's more rrrrrr
But I have to admit my mother is Spanish ... So it might explain
France : Paris University, La Sorbonne, the National Superior School
But truth is it depends what you want to learn, each university has its own field they are best at
Paris Sud, La Sorbonne and l'École normale supérieure i think
In France the way to go for good students (especially in science) is not universities but [“Grandes écoles”] (literally “high schools”) which have a special status and deliver diplomas in engineering and business
You enter them through national exams
Public French engineering schools have a very good reputation (better than the private ones)
There are no public business schools
Among the most famous ones: [l'École Polytechnique] and [CentraleSupélec] for engineering, [HEC Paris] and [l'ESSEC] for business
If you want to do a carreer in politic, it's almost mandatory to go to l'[ENA] and [Sciences Po]
Paris-Dauphine , HEC , ESSEC , ESCP , TSE or PSE, if you study Business or Economics
>Paris University, La Sorbonne
Neither really exists though (or more specifically there are 17 universities in the region, 13 "Paris University" (some of which are not in Paris) with 3 of them being named after the Sorbonne)
Paris 7 (not the "historical" Sorbonne which is Paris 1) offers it and has links with the CNRS research lab
A friend of mine did his PhD there (in Computer Science, not Linguistics though) and didn't complain
See here :
I don't really know but I guess la Sorbonne might be a good one
The University of Lyon 2 is quite good too
I wish you luck on your studies
We have universities too
But there are less prestigious than “Grandes écoles” because they are not selective
Even though you will learn the same things
There are researchers in both systems
But in this case “grandes écoles” are often associated with universities
Sorry
It depends of what you are looking for
Generally speaking I would say that an engineering grade is more valuable on the job market
If you want to do a career in academics, either way is ok
I graduated from an engineering school, and I have friends that did a PhD
An engineering grade is equivalent to a Master of Science
The best advice I could give you is to look at the classes and do what suits you the most
In french the "Sirène" is a mermaid
From [Wikipedia]
> In the folklore of some modern cultures, the concept of the siren has been assimilated to that of the mermaid
For example, the French word for mermaid is sirène, and similarly in certain other European languages
People being openly rude to waiters and the waiter is taking it with a smile because she needs the tip
It would not go down well at all with a French waiter
Any US movie / TV series where someone gets out of jail by paying a shit load of money
Yeah, they'll just kick you out and put you on the banned list and won't give a shit if you let a bad review on yelp
To be fair Spiderman would not work in rural America
I assume it is the same in the US though it’s just the movie being silly
Benalla, Balkany, Kerviel
In France they would be stopped by the toll booth of the motorway
It does not really exist much in France either
>catholic Lord of the Rings
Well it already is
they didn't had to pay a lot of money
"high speed"
I was at home alone while my mother worked when I was a child
Would even cook lunch
they only had to *have* loads of money
It's more Tripadvisor or Google Maps in France at least
Pretty much the same thing here, you usually leave a couple coins on the table when you leave if you had a really great time
You don't have to though
or good friends
And even then nobody cares about them
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
In France we all learn academic French at school, but accents and slangs may strongly vary depending on the region
We don't have a standard dialect, so everyone would speak with their own prononciation
Maybe some people would make efforts to ditch words that are specific to the region, but others would use them proudly, to teach them, or implying that they are as important as the usual words
True I have no problem understanding most Alemannic dialects
In fact when I was hospitalised in Blüdenz (Vorarlberg) it was better for me to speak Alsatian to the nurses and doctors than Hochdeutsch
Baguettes
We have ravioles [Ravioles du dauphiné] most people just boil them but you can make soup, gratin, even pizza with them
They are filled with  parsley , cheese and cottage cheese
They look a bit like Italian Ravioli but they are definitly differents
Oliebollen
Or appelbollen rather, since you need something inside the dough
I love these
Came here to say that because I live in Dauphiné. It's really specific to the area
Ooh I always thought they were Italian
Thank you for reminding me that the word is "raviolo"...
In French, we always use the plural form "ravioli" : un ravioli, des raviolis
It's quite easy to perfectly boil them: as soon as they float/go back up the saucepan they're cooked and you gotta strain them
Can't overcook them of you follow this simple rule
If you're making them as a gratin, 30 to 45 min is generally ok
Blasphème !! It’s most probably Italian inspired as there is a huge Italian community around Grenoble/Valence area
Hola malotru ! C'est une spécialité dromoise/Isèroise ! Le terroir ça se respecte !
Chocolatine vs Pain au chocolat
Pain au chocolat vs
FUCKING WRONG*
Non ! C'est :
Pain au chocolat vs Chocolatine :)
*That is exactly same bakery product, just two different names in France
A fierce fight about that crucial matter appears every other day on* r/france
EDIT: bakery product
Note that there is a third camp in the North, those who simply call it «petit pain». Wildlings
A southwestern savage must have corrupted her
Bakery = boulangerie
Baked good = produit de boulangerie
Croissant au chocolat is a version uses by really few alsacian, I think couque is belge and nobody use "petit pain" to speak about the pain au chocolat
Anyway, each real French know that the only right word is pain Chocolat
Oups
Merci pour la correction
They say "petit pain" in the North
Petit pain is commonly used in the north and north-east and croissant au chocolat isn't restricted to Alsace but is also used in Moselle and parts of Meurthe-et-Moselle
Really
I thought the québécois had a different word
TIL I guess
Some even say "petit pain".

Austria
I love their beer, I love their schnitzel, I love their trains, I love their motherfucking MOUNTAINS
I love that Vienna is so modern and clean, but the people's attitudes are just as grumpy and Parisian as Paris
I love its cafés, its old town, it's relative affordability in comparison to other highly livable cities
I love Innsbruck and the Alps and the fact that it actually snows there
I'd move there in a heartbeat if I could
Currently it's Norway
I'm not fan of out warm climate and I'd love to go to the beautiful fjords
Estonia for sure !
I did an Erasmus in northern Sweden and loved the landscapes, the nature, the free-roaming right, the food, and I know Estonia has this all, plus an amazing and fascinating culture, complex history, super cool sounding uralic language(s), and it's flat and small enough that I'll be able to ride by bicycle around it !
I don't have a crush on any country but I love everything about Ancient Greek & Roman & Egyptian culture
I basically want to be travel around the mediterranean sea and get lost in every part of it
I've been living in Mexico for 11 years
Can confirm it's a great country with amazing culture, delicious food, incredible landscapes and very nice people
+ it's cheap
Have you heard of Guedelon
Not only are we preserving Medieval architecture from time to time we are building brand new one
I rather my french passport, EU is not a nation or a country, it makes no sense to have a European passport because there is no European nationality because the European Union is not a country, it is an economic union
Indyref 2: Electric Boogaloo
It's the same than in english: tête, épaule, genoux, pied, the only difference it's that they say "2 eyes, 2 ears and one month and one nose
But we don't sing it often, and when kids learn it it's in english to learn body parts so
We have other song about body parts like "Jean petit qui danse"
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
J'ai deux yeux, deux oreilles,
Une bouche et un nez
Tête, épaules, genoux et pieds
Genoux, pieds
Pretty much the same, excepted that we explicitly count the number of eyes, ears, mouth and nose
Never heard about it
Currently for penal reasons I would say Balkany (mayor of a small city next to Paris) and his wife
He is just absolutly corrupt and barely hid it
It's very probably that he had some friends in high places to remain in politics that long
He is currently sleeping in jail after various trials for tax fraud and corruption
In the past Charles Pasqua was known for being cited in many investigation and several trials
His tactic was "When you are in the heart of a scandal, you have to create a scandal within the scandal, and if necessary a scandal within the scandal within the scanl until no one understands anything anymore".
When it comes to lack of credibility I would say Manuel Valls
He is seen as an opportunistic clown who would gobble hairy balls in public for any political responsibility
He was ridiculed as a prime minister, then tried to become the candidate of Parti Socialiste at the primaries
When he was not elected during the primaries he tried to jump ship and beg Macron for any political responsibility, Macron told him to fuck off so he won a deputy seat (while an antisemitic humorist and some guy who had been arrested for slapping Valls in the street ran against him collaboratively just to mock and humiliate him)
He then tried to run for mayor in Barcelona (he has both citizenships) and got humiliated there too
This guy is probably the most pathetic person to ever hold an office, he just has litterally no dignity
I can’t pick between Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Jérôme Cahuzac
both make people feel a bit nauseous
Phillipe Pétain
Not a politician at first, but man did he fell after WW2
De Gaulle said that "he died in 1925"
France, and I hesitate between Napoleon III and Pétain
People remember the latter better, but according to people who lived then the Second Empire was hell on earth (too)
Queen Brunehaut
Ended up despised by everyone, tortured for three days, killed by a wild horse and her body burnt
Phillipes Petain, the definition of "fallen hero"
We're talking modern times there, cause otherwise, it's Pétain all the way my dude
Bernard Tapie was also seen as an up-and-coming, charismatic 'third way' politician in the late 1980s, early 1990s. He gained praise for his aggressive debating tactics against Jean-Marie Le Pen
Now his name is synonymous with corruption
And then there's also DSK who is, well, just rapey
He would have likely been elected president had he been able to keep his dick in his pants
For the non-French here, Jérôme Cahuzac is the epitome of political hypocrisy
He was President Hollande's Minister of the Budget, which meant he had to look into tax fraud
Cahuzac was eventually found guilty of
tax fraud
After telling an interviewer, "Looking at you in the eyes, I swear I have never held a bank account in Switzerland
Turns out he held a bank account in Switzerland
Modern, yeah, maybe, but overall, Pétain, obviously
Yeah of course
It's why I only mentioned pretty recent ones
I think Laval is by far the one that everybody blames for most of the exaction of Vichy
Pétain is still remembered and honored has the savior of Verdun, therefor way more mixed fealing towards him
After, historicaly by oder of importance, I'll say Napoleon III and maybe Louis XVI and/or Marie-Antoinette
Is it deserved or not is an other story
(Basicaly the symboles of the type of rule that France had that weren't republicain)
I think that even if France has had worst leader before the Revolution, no one cares about them anymore
Depends on the country, but generally we're more rigid with degrees and certifications
Getting into the job market is certainly harder, but getting thrown out of it is also harder
We're more anxious about getting hired than fired
I really can't understand how having a 100 different brands of processed foodstuff is any criterion for better life quality
Many Americans have mentioned it in this thread and for me if anything it shows poor  quality food preferences
In Europe in general one can find local and seasonal produce and a fair choice of processed stuff, even in small places
Perhaps these people are looking to buy the brands they used back home
If one's not going to try local stuff, why move at all
I don't get it
Edit: that's a cute handle you have there
I find that just sick and decadent really
Exactly
And then pretend it's a great thing for quality of life
I prefer to spend my time on a terrace café rather than in front of a 30 metre long aisle of cookies in the supermarket
I've lived long term in 5 countries in Europe and a couple more in America
Perhaps I do lack the ability to yearn for "home" stuff because I moved a lot, and I don't really have a place I consider my home country
I do sometimes want to have a taste of this or that,  stuff that is not common where I am currently, but I'll just wait until I visit again or go without, no big deal
Same for mother tongue stuff, I don't miss it
I understand
Free leisure options are pretty limited, right
The question is, can people not have it because the offer is just not there, or would people (excluding tourists) not use the opportunity to just sit there and people watch if available
The whole society is geared towards consumerism: one's time is either used to produce money or spend it
Sorry friend, I'll have an espresso for you
In France, we also have the well but we don’t use because it wins against both the rock and the scissors so it’s not fair
They're less culturally suited to Anglo-Saxon liberalism, which has become the rule as we're plugged into the US' systems
That's also the reason why what used to be the backwaters of Europe has prospered in the late 20th c.
Because the euro is overvalued for our economies
The EU prohibits the control of financial and commodity flows
As a result our domestic production is more expensive to export, which has the consequence of causing factory closures and relocations in Eastern Europe, where because of the EU there is no control possible
As a result, unemployment is increasing due to the application of disastrous neoliberal policies
The peoples of southern Europe do not want to be stripped twice as the neoliberals demand after destroying our jobs, they want to destroy our public services to align themselves with the northern Europeans who have no culture of contesting power
There are two ways to reduce unemployment: either abolish neo-liberalism, regain our borders, our currency and engage in protectionism, or else submit even more to those responsible for the current situation and allow our public services to be destroyed like the Nordic people
+ note that unemployment stats are fake for us
The lack of work ethics is staggering in whole of Spain and Portugal, no wonder they're falling out of the world stage
I'm hopeful about Italy
There is always innovation and competitiveness in the north but the south may get out of its slump too
Greece is somewhat relying on foreign investment
How does this not bother you
I have not dealt any business in Portugal but the time I spent in Spain was excruciating
It takes forever to get anything done and it's so aggravating
Yet they're all so chill about it
Are you all OK with languishing your life away
What’s the median salary in Austria
We should compare the ratio of the two
I do love imagining an army of Finns raking the forest though
Oh really
Who was this famous French politician
And what was the context
I'm curious
Oh, so he was complaining about your support for the Irak war ?
Well, fundamentally, I agree with him
Europe should not have supported this intervention
But he should not have say that this way, it was really arrogant and condescending
>The British papers took the opportunity to diss the french
Haha obviously :)
And that's at this period Chirac get the surname "the worm" by the British press
No , people should be able only if they are citizen
They can already vote in the communes\*. For national elections they need citizenship
No but a little yes
For presidential elections : no
For legislative elections : No
BUT I could be open for having **ONE** deputy that can represent foreigners in a country
Only french citizens should be able to vote in elections even for local one
This
If you want to vote for national election become a national citizen
For a national matter the rule needs to be simple and show at least some commitment to the nation
Giving non national a right to vote in national will only give fuel to xenophobia and right ext
Doing so would only end in civil war or some sort of nationalist taking power to get rid of it
To vote for a nation you need to be part of it end of story
In French, we have many but here are some absurd ones I like :
Tu vas pas nous en chier une horloge (you won't shit a clock about it) - - said when someone is making a fuss for something unnecessary
For the same situation, we also use "en faire tout un fromage" (to make a whole cheese about smth)
On n'est pas sorti de l'auberge ! (We're not out of the inn
) - - said when you're facing a difficult situation and you can't see an end to it in a foreseeable future
Être con à bouffer de la merde ! (to be dumb enough to eat shit) - - said to speak of someone you consider really dumb
Ça casse pas trois pattes à un canard
(It doesn't break three legs to a duck) - - said about smth that is good without being great/amazing
Prendre quelqu'un entre quatres yeux
(take someone between four eyes) - - have an argument
Poser in lapin (To put a rabbit) - - to stand somebody up/not come to an agreed place
Prendre un râteau (to take a rake) - - when someone refuses to become you boyfriend /girlfriend
Also works with mettre un râteau (put a rake) when you're the one refusing
My favourite one from French (the best are always the vulgar ones) is to refer to someone stupid/ugly and saying “il a été fini à la pisse” (he was finished with urine (by their dad))
Un de perdu dix de retrouvés (one lost, 10 found)
I never understood that thing
Usually people say that when someone gets dumped by his girlfriend/boyfriend in order to cheer the person up
But I don't know what that really means
Je suis pas un lapin de 6 semaines (I am not a 6 weeks old rabbit) = I am not an idiot/naive person
Un nom a coucher dehors (litteraly a name to sleep outside) = a very lame name
Mon cul
(My ass) = when someone lies to you and you don't believe the lie
Bonus: Et mon cul c'est du poulet
(And my ass is made out of chicken
) It is the same meaning but the polite way to say it is "Mon œil ! (My eye)
Femme qui rit, a moitié dans son lit (Woman who laughs, half-way in your bed) = a dumb way to say that women like funny men
Grenouille de bénitier (frog of the holy water bowl) =someone really christian but in a mocking way
Il faut pas pousser mémé dans les orties (don't push grandma in the nettles) = don't exagerate
*Il a ete berc*é *trop pr*é*s du mur* : "he has been rocked too close to the wall", implying someone had his head repeatedly banged on the wall as a baby, resulting in being a moron
&#x200B;
*Il ne faut pas pousser M*é*m*é *dans les orties* : "one shall not push Granny in the nettles", meaning that someone is pushing something too far
A similar one with the same meaning : "Il lui manque 15 minutes de cuisson" (He's missing 15 minutes of cooking)
Haha probably my favourite as well
Funny thing we have this expression too but it really doesn't mean the same
We say "c'est à se taper le cul par terre" (it's to hit your ass against the ground) to refer to something extremely funny
"Rester bouche bée" in french
The french version is "Construire des châteaux en Espagne", to build castles in Spain
It’s not exactly the persons idea that’s crazy it’s just the person is stupid
I could get by without English in Italy, Monaco, Switzerland partly, Luxembourg and Belgium, maybe close to the border in Spain as well
I live near the border with Germany
Sometimes I go there and think I can go ahead and practice my German but every other person over the border speaks pretty good French
We need to go a bit further away form the border to really need English or German
I speak German (though it's pretty rusty), so Germany and Austria should be fine, as well as the German-speaking part of Switzerland
I guess German might also come in handy in Czechia, but I'd probably default to English simply because I'm better at it
The usage of 'bah' makes you 50% french
Alright, italians are superior in that sense
Although bah sounds weird for the way italian sounds (while for french it's typical as a lot of words & expressions end with the sound of 'a')
You are right, but in pronounciation, a lot of words end with the 'a' sound despite ending with consonents
'Bois, Vois, Voix'. Or some vowel ending words like 'Toi, Loi, Moi, Va, Là' etc
Mainly did France - Switzerland
If you go through the border at Geneva they just check that you have the sticker for the highway and make you buy one if you don't.
On the other one I regularly take, sometimes there are border agents but we just slow down and never get stopped
Most of the time there is nobody
And I saw the border agents fishing in the nearby river once
Now if you’re in Strasbourg (France) you can literally just take the tramway to Germany, as they’ve extended one of the central city line recently
I always dazzled me that you can cross a border riding the tramway
I live in France, and tobacco is cheaper in Belgium, so many French people in this region go buy their cigarettes there
There's a sign telling you you're in Belgium, and my car tells me the speed limits there which is thoughtful, because otherwise I might get a ticket
There are occasional border checks for drugs and such, but on the country roads, you hardly notice you've crossed the border, except that there's suddenly better beer
I live in Strasbourg
It's the closest city to Germany
[Like you basically have to cross a bridge] and you go from Strasbourg to Kehl (German city)
We have a tramway line crossing the border
I go there once a week to buy groceries because it's cheaper
It's really that easy to go to cross the border
Occasionally there are controls but I never had one
I went to Switzerland last year : No controls
The only time I got controlled was in the train to Luxembourg
My wallpaper is also Ghibli themed
A cool fanart of Mononoke Princess I found online
This wallpaper of [Roronoa Zoro] from One Piece
On my laptop, I have my company's boring default images
On my phone, my lock screen is a picture of my son
On my phone a Baby Yoda drawing and on my PC a nice Gojira related artwork ( Best French metal band)
A picture of a deer on a mountain with a sunset behind, and the milky way and stars seen from a campsite
On my phone it's often one of their stock photos in colours I like or a picture of Taylor Swift, depending
On my laptop it's a photo mode picture from AC Odyssey
My PC wallpaper is from Ascension
And phone is my forest
I dig Phone 2, been doing the same and I never not see it :)
Same here, I have the Debian default wallpaper since I never see it with my current window manager
Ohh Kinky, naah it’s my GF x)
I went from not liking this to loving this lol
The jokes and the cliché french accent
I'm sorry
My belgian friends I play RPGs with
Tripels
High rivalry in 2018 World Cup, beer, Bruxelles, Damso
Shortcut to my country for Germany
2 group of different peoples in one country
[Belgica movie]
A shit ton of jokes
Roméo Elvis, Damso, c'était au temps où Bruxelles chantait, c'était au temps du cinéma muet
Jacques Brel
r/yesyesyesno
He's both
He was created by a belgian author and he works for a belgian journal (Le Petit Vingtième), but he has a lot fo links to France
His friends are french, the iconic Moulinsart castle is french, etc
For a human sure, but we're talking about a character
The embodiment of *franco-belgian comic strips*. That's literally how anyone with some culture in the subject will call Tintin : *franco-belgian*. And a founder, so there's really nothing to be ashamed of
Who else if not Belgium ?
Germany the most I guess
Well my friends and me make a lot of jokes about Germany and France of ww1 ww2
Belgium and England
Did you know that a whale’s vagina is big enough to fit a horse in it ? Which makes it the biggest pussy after Italy in both world wars
Don’t forget England
It's not like you have a lot of other neighbors
> I don't know where this cliche comes from but apparently Belgians are pedophiles
Marc Dutroux
And you let them pass Belgium
Dammit, you always did !
Don't you dare Spain's butt ! ; )
Hmpf ! La bave du crapeau jamais n'atteint la blanche colombe ; )
It’s not loosing if you surrender
The fact that I forgot about that "country" proves that is not really significant
I doubt Spaniards have a lot of stereotypes about Andorra
Our « rivalry » with the Germans in recent times was really about the Prussian block
Tell that to the Italian
I'm in my IT classroom
Due to Covid all windows have to be open
10°c I would say
9° Here, doing some DIY  i have all my door open so, as warm as outside
Usually I will heat up in the night about 17° FR
I'm currently outside
It's 5pm and the temperature is 15°C but experienced temperature is 12°C.
Actually it's okay I'm not complaining we're used to it and like that we kept presential lessons during the second wave
What the fuck is "vin brûlé" ? It looks like it's how you call hot wine with spices in Italy, using french words ? In France we call it "vin chaud" (warm wine)
On the other hand, we use the Italian word "panini" to define one grilled sandwich
Plural "paninis"...
That's it
"Burnt wine".
Norway doesn't want to join because they don't want to stop killing whales
Recently (since the last presidential campaigns basically), the word "infox" started to arise in the classical media (TV/Radio)
It's just the fusion of two words "info" and "intox" which is an informal word for propaganda
It's on its way to replace the anglicism "fake news" which was commonly used until now
Fake news is still widely use tho, as infox is still very recent
It's the sound for fart in french (prout)
I’m pretty sure men & women won’t have the same answers here
Studied it a bit, actually
Anyway, I’m a woman in Paris: some areas are as safe as they get, others not at all
There’s no real city-large tendance
Women are frequently being harassed in Paris at night and most of them feel unsafe to walk alone at night
As a guy though I never had any problem and feel completely safe
I live in Lyon and I walked home drunk in the middle of the night and I never had an issue
I am a burly guy though so maybe other people have different experiences
There are some districts on the periphery where I would not necessarily risk it though
Créteil, France (Paris 94 suburbs)
Not safe at night, depends where in the city though
I’m living in Barcelona but originally from Marseille (~1M)  I’m a male never had an issue in BCN but I would avoid definitely Born which is full of those Moroccans teenagers without papers, they are very unstable and it is very common to get robbed by them, same goes with Gotico and Raval and apparently now Poble Sec
Now about Marseille = one of the most dangerous places in Europe
I’m 1,85 84kg male and some Algerian youngster came with a knife on me
Didn’t get hurt
I could testify an acid attack at the train station, many fights and thefts in the streets
many homophobic acts (some friend got spitted on) ... during the day the city center has many Rroma people using half naked children to beg for money
I would not recommend to go there, even for tourism
that’s a pity
It probably depends a lot on the neighborhood, no
One of my (woman) friends moved from Born to Eixample, and she said it made a massive difference in how safe she felt walking back home at night
That was one hell of a gamble, glad it worked out for you ! This guy was a good guy !
I wouldn't say Châtelet is the most dangerous station, Gare du Nord is far worse in my opinion
I would also feel unsafe by volcanoes while not erupting
I share this point of view
It’s worse than Châtelet (though the problem with châtelet is the fact that the station is _huge_: some areas are bound to be off camera, I guess
I dont think we do, but there’s the accordion stereotype
More regional than French, in Provence there is a very traditional three hole pipe called galoubet
It is played very high pitch
And is usually accompanied with a tambourin (tabor) marking the rythm
An example here:
There are regional and traditional instruments (accordion would be more for 20th century, for bal musette)
Those that are still somewhat played today are mostly present in other countries, but are associated to some regions in France too:
Biniou
Bombarde
Celtic harp
Vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy)
« D'ailleurs, j'ai horreur, de tous ces flon-flons
De la valse musette, et de l'accordéonnnnnnn»
It sounds so good
Might be my favorite instrument
Wait what
I came to say that, everytime a foreign movie has a scene set in France there is accordion music
Euhhh [excuse me]
And [this song]
Maybe we have the same instrument because we have  the same flag but not in the same direction
I think so too, but for i think an american saw one day a dude playing it in paris,  decided it was french thing and somehow everyone agreed
No mostly individual
About the song, it’s a drinking song:
« Come and have a drink at home
There's white (wine), there's red (wine) and saucisson
And Gillou with his little accordion
Long live the bottle, the friends and the songs »
Napoleon did his basic military training there
And Pope Pie VI died there
We've got a special pastry inspired by the Swiss gards during their stay
Literally every event in French history lol
The most significant one probably being the Storming of the Bastille
This makes me realize how my city historically is just a chill wealthy city
Nothing happened here
We hosted Jean Moulin when he organized the resistance and it's not even that true because he wasn't hosted in Lyon but around
Someone called Henri Deschamps hosted Jean Moulin at his house in my hometown
Now there is a commemorative plate on his house and one of the primary school is called Henri Deschamps
I live in the city where the Hermione (Lafayette's boat) was built, the boat he sailed on to go to America and fight in the civil war
A Priest seeing the archangel michael appearing to him and ordering him to build an abbey dedicated to him on a giant rock
And tadaaaaaaa Mont Saint Michel, most visited french place outside Paris !
One of the first railway of Europe (right after the english one i believe) was created from my city (Saint-Etienne) to Lyon
Bite
Yeah in french it means cock
"Bite" in French means cock or penis
"bite" - cock
"pain" - bread
"pet" - fart
Peter = to fart
Coin = corner
cave = cellar
lecture = reading
Pain = bread
store = window blind
Injure =  insulte
and many more
Don’t take Europe as one entity
Every country is different from its neighbors and people even behave differently within the same country (for example, southern french are much more friendly and talkative with strangers than northern french)
Don’t dress like the basic American tourist, and try to make an effort
If you want to ask something to some random stranger in the streets, try to go for the younger people
They most likely learned English relatively well
There’s this thing I noticed with the Americans I met : when asked where you’re from, you never say « America », but always the state and the city
It’s a bit obnoxious like we have to know your country so well that we can deduce that you’re from the US, but if I say that I come from Brest, Bretagne, I bet you couldn’t know what I talked about
So first just say that you come from the US
Just enjoy your experience without being blinded by the clichés.
Say hello before speaking to people, be polite, don't block anyone's way in the middle of the street, don't talk loudly in a restaurant/museum and I think you'll be fine
Just be polite and respectful, and embrace the local cultures with its pros and cons without comparing it to yours (at least, not aloud)
Well, i don't know exactly how things are in the USA, but remember people in Europe are busy with their own schedules and won't be necessary disposed to answer you, a tourist
I'm sure if you are polite, however, you will have great success
Trying to learn a few words in the language of the country you will visit is always a plus
People love when strangers try to talk their language, it's funny and it shows you are willing to communicate with them
Apart from Poland and Italy, is there truly any really religious country left in Europe ? :)
Even as a Frenchman, it really sometimes takes way too long
Especially when the longest meals are the family meetings I absolutely don't care about
>Even now when we eat, i'll get up immediately, and she'll just be sat
You leave her eat alone ?
France is with you on this one, sweet popcorn is obviously the way to go
> like the french
LOL
I use to live in the Netherlands and married a Dutch woman
You, Dutch people, are obsessed with having just sandwiches for lunch
I am pretty sure 90% of the world population have a warm meal for lunch, but you are the weird ones
Naaaah we got both, you liard
Yes, but the big majority eat sweet
\>american sitcom
\>someone does anything remotely sexual
\>it's badly received
\>"i-it's european"
spare me
Not really about Europe but black Americans attaching stereotypes to "white people" which are just ridiculous if you think about Europeans
Food, dancing, learning multiple languages, lack of empathy
These are all things I have seen "white people" be criticized for, and it's ridiculous, I'm not even sure if this applies to white Americans (legitimately, I don't know) but it sure as hell doesn't apply to "white people" in general
NoW It's NoT EuRopE IT's AfrIcA
Well, uh, our speech laws are still way stricter than in the US
In the US you may say anything you want without legal repercussion, except calls for violence, or false accusations
In many European countries, some political ideologies are banned, some images are banned, denying certain genocides is banned
etc
By "banned" I mean punishable by law
I'm not saying it's good to deny genocides, but I don't think it's up to politicians to say what really happened in history
That's up to history scholars
Granted though, in most of Europe we still enjoy a lot of freedom, and your average Joe rarely gets in a position where he'll say something that's considered illegal
But still, in Europe there definitely isn't free speech like in the US
This
During the 2017 election Americans pretended to care about French elections and it was so obvious to spot who was who
Both Liberals and Conservatives pick a French candidate to support and had not idea about their policies
Hearing talk-show hosts talk about the election was legitimately painful
See, I've never heard that, because our racists would say "we have so much violent crime becuase we're not homogenous enough" (we really don't have that much violent crime)
Everyone was both at some point
And that's without talking about all those who predicted the result without understanding how the election worked
I moved around a lot and it's usually black people in anglo-saxon countries/communities that think like this
Ethinic Africans/South Americans say things like this less often I found (not that they are any less critical of "white people", but at least their criticism is based on history or hatred and not ignorance)
Europe is far from being a white society too lmao
It's clear what you mean, but, there is a subtle hilarity about " I see black men about 10-15 times per day"  versus " I see about 10-15 black men per day" lol .
It's the coverage from John Oliver that I was thinking about when I wrote my comment
Although his was not that bad IIRC
> Also fine if female has male nipple stickers on her nipples
wat
Exactly I live near Luxembourg and hating Portuguese people seems to be the norm
Well yeah that’s what I meant lmao .you guys are more racist toward French than toward Portuguese
Wow . Honestly I get that they want to be fully french and I think it's okay but they just seems like asshole giving up on their family like that . Personally I have italian family and although I consider myself 100% french (I actually even refused to take the double nationality) I still go and see them very often and I don't compare their country to France and they're still my family
And they don't mind the fact that I don't consider myself italian and still consider me as their family
I have no idea I guess there is a lot of Portuguese people but honestly it’s stupid they don’t cause trouble or anything
Yeah idk why people would bully people for being of portuguese descent kids are retarded
It's weird 'cause portuguese people are like the only european people who really suffer hard racism in modern france
Idk I’d never assume something about so many people
In Paris, 25 sqm in the city centre (district 1 to 10), 30 to 45 in the outer circle (11 to 20)
In you want 45 sqm, there's probably no elevator, though
Haute-savoie (alps)
My village, 100-150m² (so 4 to 6 rooms) with possibly a great view on the mountains
But we are not as touristic as other places around, so going 10-20km from there will make the prices double or triple
I live in the countryside, I don't know about flats but this is definitely enough to buy a relatively big house (total of 3 "floors," your regular floor, one that is downstairs and one that is upstairs) with a garden
I don't live in a place that tourists dream of going to lol
100m2 house on 800m2 with up to date insulation, heat pump etc
A comfortable place 30km from Bordeaux city center
Ok I've just checked official statistics: 37% of apartments in Paris don't have an elevator (in 2016)
Lots of place do, but there's a remaining 15/20% building without
Every room where you could put a bed or a sofa bed into and that has its own window
Living room, bedrooms, study, etc
Dining room too, if separated from the kitchen
Ok, I found my new place
Stay away from Paris
It sucks
Instead, visit Nice, Strasbourg, Nantes, Monaco, Quimper, Arcachon
I remembe the umbrella girls from the year I lived in Krakow, they were every-fucking-where around Rynek Glowny, even during daytime, asking people in front of family
I've never took them myself but i've always wondered if the horse carriage city tours were scams
Other than that, great country, great people, great food :)
Yeah, and the wands don't even work
Let alone the nimbus 2000s
I’ve also heard the people selling beers on the beach store their beers in the sewers
is this true ?
Paris is far from sucking
When compared to other major French cities it's true that Paris is not the most pleasant place to be, if you come to France to just have a good time and have a taste of French life then I agree there's better places than Paris for that
But if you come for the architecture or the cultural offer then Paris is a no-brainer
Lyon for instance is an awesome place with plenty to see, but with two days you'll have basically seen everything the city has to offer, you can push to 4 days if you want to spend time in museums or really take things slow
4 days in Paris you'll have barely scratch the surface and what you'll see will be in an order of magnitude way above similar offers in other cities
I would never want to live in Paris, nor wish it to my worst enemy, but the Paris bashing is a bit tiring
I'll advise tourists coming in France to check their expectations and be sure about what they want to do, then Paris may not be the best destination and a "road trip" around the country could be better suited
But crossing out Paris out of the blue could be a big mistake
Did you get dumped in paris or something
Paris is a big city and for some that can be a bit off putting but few places in the world can rival the cultural density of Paris
Museums and monuments are worth at least a week of a tourists time IMO and they’ll be left with still plenty to do if they stay longer
Telling people to stay away is simply absurd
That being said other cities in France have a lot to give as well and are often a bit overlooked by tourists sadly
My favorite ‘hidden gem’ is Metz
I love the view of the cathedral you get from the other side of the Moselle when the sun sets
Also awesome train station
Paris c'est nul point barre
Security, scenery, royal palace
I see ! I was thinking it might be a quite effective (but disgusting) way of selling constantly fresh beers
It would take about 10 days to spend 10 seconds in front of each of everything at the Louvres
Most tourist don't see a tenth of what is actually exposed
Locals even less
(about a hundred hours and it's opened nine hours a day)
Which is a Japanese thing due to their cultural image of Paris that make them believe it is all like Amelie Poulain movie
A westerner never had Paris syndrome
It's not just disappointment, it's hallucinations, delirium, feeling of persecution, tachycardia etc
It's an actual psychological issue
Similar phenomenon exists for Jerusalem which has mostly archeological traces from after the 11th century, far from the holiness expectations of some people
Yes, it's almost exclusively among Asian tourists
The over-romanticizisation of Paris in Asian media and the strong cultural shock between Europe and Asia are mainly to blame
Paris first remains a big western city, and a really busy one
It's understandable that people who were being mislead to see it as a magical amusement park live it as a jarring experience once you add the jet lag and being, for some, the first time in a very foreign environment
Dandelions in French are called pissenlit
Literally pee-in-bed, because they make it easier for you to pee
Chauve-souris in France, means bald mouse
How do you say "hot dog"?
Everybody is speaking and writing English lmao
ni povas paroli en Esperanto se homoj preferas
Estas lacaj de la angla kiel internacia lingvo
La angloj forlasas la Eŭropan Union, La usonanoj pli kaj pli konsistas ... kial ni devas plu paroli la anglan
C'est pas faux
Automatically translated
is that a thing
I would be interested in an automatic translator
It's very science fiction
Looks like the Belgian r/rance
Using "submarine" for "subreddit" has become a meme on its own in r/france after an auto-translated post by some tourist
The sub already had a craving for litteral translations of everything, so this fits perfectly
r/rance litterally translates to *rancid*, I've always liked the name
I just wished it'd be r/ance (rance) because now we got AirFrance and Errance
Same in France
Street level is called "rez-de-chaussée" (pronounced rey de sho-say)
It comes from old French i think, but basically it means right-next-to-street
Then the next level is first floor, then second floor, etc
This is funny because the fact that different language use different words, all the problem could come from people counting different things !
English count the floors and French count the "étages", and an étage is by definition something above the floor
So English count levels, and French count stages of a building sort of
I am sure there is other example in other languages
rez is cognate with raz, meaning 'level'
Oh like a group of flower ? We say "un parterre de fleurs" here sometimes

Les frères Lumière invented Cinema
The guillotine haha
Fries are a Parisian invention bro
Beer is not a German invention xD
The car, the television and the computer are not exclusive german inventions though
Same goes for the beer (from babylon), the paper (China), lightlub (Joseph swan from uk), telephone (Bell from USA), you invented the bismark healthcare, but there is also the beveridgie healthcare (Uk) etc

The department where Lille is located is just called "North" simply because
it's at the North of France
In France too, there are dozens of place names that include "[Villeneuve]
It was named like that because back then people were not speaking french, or identifying with France, that much
We were Flemish and the department (not exactly same borders but close) was called "Province de Flandre" before the revolution
In 1790 the Parisian administration named us "Departement du Nord" in an attempt to remove the historical bond of local people to the flemish culture and to make them more French
In the 19th century speaking French was seen as high class while Flemish was seen as the language of the masses and the "uneducated farmers". In the early 20th century only a few farmers were still speaking flemish as a first language
In Dunkirk we still use a lot of words that comes from flemish in our local dialect, but there's barely anyone left that does speaks flemish there
The massive campaign of the government to forbid the use of local languages in the area in the 19th and early 20th century worked well
Elderly from my family told me once that in the 1920s there were big signs in school that said "forbidden to speak flemish" and if students were caught they were getting punished (back then they had physical punishments allowed at school, so they were basically beaten up by their teachers
And now the whole new region is called "Haut-de-France", in the vote we had also the possibility of "Flandre-Artois-Picardie" which I'll have preferred (FAP region lol), but I guess it will have been too empowering of historical local identities
In order to lesser the identities in both Departments, they called them Pyrénées Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees) and Pyrénées Atlantiques (Atlantic Pyrenees) while they are the "French" counterparts to Euskara and Catalonia
As well as the whole region « Hauts de France » (Upper France)
I was thinking more of [Neuville]
Terres du nord frère !
I don't understand the uproar
What's wrong in saying hosts are liable for copyright
I might be too old :)
It's bad, but it's almost like the end of the world according to reddit
Some think that this vote will make people vote for eurosceptic parties and, around me, I really don't know anyone who cares that much, and I don't see them vote for such parties only on the basis of that vote

I don't think I've ever seen anyone eating pizza with sauce (as in dipping)
not garlic or tomato but more very spicy sauces
I have no qualms putting Maggi sauce over every kind of food and call it cooking
But pizza
you crossed a line there
Pro: high variety of awesome fine food, good wine is cheap, big variety of beautiful places to see, contrary to the stereotype people are mostly alright, good public healthcare and safety net
Con: you have to plan your movements around strikes, we have around 9% unemployment
Pros: food, healthcare, places to see
&#x200B;
Cons: worst education system in Europe imo (stress is through the roof, too many hours, self-teaching is better), we complain over ANYTHING, strikes everywhere all the time
Tbh, I don't really like this place
Pros: pretty, a lot of culture and history, big for Europe with varied landscapes, high standards for schools, pretty good living standards, delicious food, good food and social culture, pretty language
Cons: politics are getting worse every year, lots of unresolved social issues, too centralized around Paris, expensive for Europe
Genuine question : is too much light an issue ?
Cons : High taxes and bad public services on average for what we pay
Shit educative system
Too much differences between Paris and the rest
Bad broadband in the countryside
People complaining for nothing
Corrupt politicians
There is literally no pros to living in France to you or you are just adding to my comment
A strong lightbulb is not in the same ballpark as natural light
I’m just adding to your comment
France is a nice country to live in
It could just be much better
So much potential yet so much delusion
I love my country don’t worry
USSR/Russia : Katyusha, My army, Polyushka Polye, Farewell of slavianka
Germany (including GDR and GFR) : Der offene Aufmarsh, Erika, "Unterwegs, Soldaten, Marsh
", Wo alle Straßen enden
South Korea : Torch of communism eradication, Arirang nation
North Korea : No motherland without you, Defend headquarter of revolution, My country is the best, The answered soldier, We pledge, We know nobody but you, One against a hundred, People call and follow him, Chollima on the wing
Cuba : Hasta siepre Che Guevara, Cuba my love
The russian "We need only one victory" : [
I like the italian revolutionary song Bella Ciao
Outside of American marches, I am fond of a Romanian patriotic song : "Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire", which means "On our flag is written Union".
Link to the YouTube video : [
I hope it will interest someone
edit: a grammar error
I vow to thee my country from the english is maybe one of my favorite but if someone can explaine me the background of this song, i'll be very pleased
Listen to the Tuva Republic anthem, it is really amazing !
I adore Hatikvah and I hate that it’s seen as glorification or supporting of Israeli government or any of their policies
It was written in the 1800s as an important and heartfelt declaration of a people persecuted and forced into exile and broken into a wide diaspora, yearning to be free to be together again in their ancestral land
Now every time I heard it I’m reminded of the stories of people being forced to march to their deaths in the Shoah, still singing Hatikvah and yearning for the survival and freedom of their people
So glad I’m not the only one
Another fun fact, Brittany loves so much the welsh anthem (well, the welsh culture as well), we share the same tune
[Welsh anthem]
[Breton anthem]
Yup can confirm, thanks to the 6 Nations I can listen to Celtic anthems I'd never know else and the Irish, Welsh and Scottish anthems sound really great (even the British one but I'm not allowed to say this)
Yup sounds even better when 80000 people are singing it in the stadium, same for all other Celtic anthems (and I have to admit I like the English one too but I can't say this in public that's a secret)
Yeah the DDR anthem is clearly the best of the two
Do you know "Defend the HQ of the Revolution"? Legitimately intimidating North Korean song
Haha, true
We really disliked the Austrians during the french revolution
Translation for those who wonder:
**Verse 1:**
*Let's go children of the fatherland,*
*The day of glory has arrived
*Against us stand tyranny*
*The bloody flag is raised
(repeat)*
*In the countryside, do you hear*
*The roaring of these fierce soldiers
*They come right to our arms*
*To slit the throats of our sons, our wife
**Chorus:**
*Grab your weapons, citizens
*Form your battalions
*Let's march
Let's march
*May an impure blood*
*Water our fields
Hahaha, it's brillant !
Thank you for the share, I love it !
Yup, I had an Israeli roommate in the US who identified as European and the first time I thought it was far-fetched
Thankfully I ultimately don't care but I remember it as a surprising "wait what did he just said ?" moment in my head
The big windstorm of 1997
I was born the next century but trees still haven't regrown up
My department has still a big part of its forests destroyed
The [eruption of Montagne Pelée] in 1902: the biggest city in the Martinique island, Saint-Pierre, was completely destroyed, 30
000 people died
I suspect in England everybody’s imagination is still captured by the Titanic and the film hardly stemmed the morbid fascination with it
I'd suggest watching this [*Perfect Storms* episode] for those that want to learn more about it
Aren't you talking about the "Lothar" storm of 1999
It was so violent that it blew off the chimney on top of our roof
Huge, but is that one well known
I don’t really think so, I’ve told people who did not even know the mont pelée existed about it countless times
I think it was named after the volcano rather than after the event :) But I do know of that
What I meant is that in France what happens in the ultra-marine territories is (sadly) not well known, at all
I’m therefore not sure that’s our most famous catastrophe
Especially since (but those might be out of the question asked by OP
) the Bataclan events are known much better, as well as the explosion of a factory in Lyon
Onion soup : rarely eaten, mostly in winter at ski stations, in some counrty side or in tourist restaurants
I had it twice in my life and know many people who had never taste it
Snails: we do it them but those who eat them only have it like for christmas and maybe once in spring
Many had never tried
Same with frogs
Croissant: I mean we do have some regulary (often for a foreigner point of view), but it's definitely not the normal breakfast
It's a treat for some lazy Sundays
Crepe: same, we don't have crepe for breakfast like you can make some pancakes, it's too much work (you can be satisfied with 2 or 3 pan cakes, but not with crepe)
It's a treat
Baguette: well, we do have bread everyday but many, especially in the country side would have an other kind of bread with a different shape (traditional or campagne): better taste and last longer
But some people still have a baguette almost every day
Wine: while elders traditionaly have a glass of wine for lunch/diner no matter what, it's not a thing anymore, it's more like for a diner with friends/family or at restaurant
In foreign (especially british and american) movies, people like to go back home and have a big glass of wine after a hard day, that's not really a thing here, we have it while eating
Most would have nothing or a beer or something similar
Cheese: we don't... wait
Actually, we do it a lot of cheese
never mind
I am part of the 10% then
Regarding French dishes that we do not eat that often, what I have never eaten and will never eat, is snails
And I may have eaten frog legs two times in my life, and one of these times has been outside of France
La choucroute garnie is indeed considered a typical Alsatian dish in France, but eaten throughout the country
I am personaly not a great fan of cabbage, and even less of fermented cabbage
Leaving the bread upside down on the table brings bad luck
\-The bread put on the wrong face is either a symbolic of upcoming death ( royal hangmans used to do so ) or a call for the devil
\-Seeing the shape of a white ghost lady by night while driving means you will have a deadly accident
\-In Brittany, hearing weird creaking sounds by night can be the Ankou ( evil demon, looks like a skeleton with local outfit ) coming with his undead horse
\-You don't say "good luck" to someone preparing for something important because it brings misfortune
"Bonne merde" ( "good shit" ) is better, it's related to old era where an opera can tell if they a lot of customer because of the amount of shit they brought on the floor
>* if you hick up that meas someone is speaking about you that moment
We have something similar but with tinnitus

Street harassment
All the female friends I know, have been confronted by men either following them to ask their numbers or cat whistled
I even know a few who would take an Uber to come home at night when they could actually walk for 20mn to arrive at their places
It's a serious problem, and of course a lot of men are somehow getting offended to be told that you can't bother a woman walking on a street
All the women I know who moved either to Canada or Germany told me it was a great relief compared to France, as they felt safe at last going out at night
Street harassment when you are a young woman
I lived near "la défense", a place that is supposed to be safe, because it is the business district of Paris
There are few inhabitants, we mostly meet workers during the day
&#x200B;
Yet in one year, I had been followed seven times
&#x200B;
My worst experience was a return from a festival (I saw macklemore at the sollidays) around 6am in the subway
3 young men came to me and proposed me an after-party at their house, I ignored them
At the terminus, I hurried to go out in order  to avoid them
After five minutes, an RATP agent (underground) grabbed my arm and said "*follow me*". He brought me into the RATP office and made me meet several of his colleagues
They were as confused as me
I asked him what I was doing here
He replied "*So, I can see that you are still a little bit drunk and I think you didn't understand what was going on
I heard several men talking about you, they were planning to follow you".*
\- "*Oh yes, I remember these 3 guys
They talked to me in the underground
He answered me with a grave voice: "*There were not three men, madam
I counted eight
&#x200B;
The next day, I bought myself a pepper spray
And I never go out without it
&#x200B;
Edit: I corrected some errors :/
We suck so hard at English it's tough to find cinemas airing original versions outside of big cities
Not a major problem, but can be annoying when you really dislike dubbed movies
Never EVER tell you salary in France, especially if you win more than 2000e. It's pretty taboo to speak about that
The 'Hatred of the "rich" ' is pretty strong here, jealousy is rampant
Personnaly I don't care one bit if you're making more than me , that good for you but a lot of people (mostly on the far-left of the political spectrum) can hate you and / or may agress you because of that
Also people always saying that our country is shit
We're not without problem but holy duck, if you listen to them you would think we're a third-rate country
Wages are extremely low compared to other Western countries
The cost of the health system is not justified by its quality, others do better and cheaper but some still believe that the service at this price is satisfactory
That we have the highest taxation in the world (45% of GDP)
How is it in the summer ? You get way more sunshine than central Europe right ?
You should get a luminotherapy lamp
Makes wonders
Even for guys it's a relief
I live in Germany (not that I didn't liked France, but got a job opportunity and decided to move), and it feels so safe compared to France that's insane
You can go to a bar, left your jacket and bag on a chair, then go play pool for like one hour, and when you come back everything is still there, untouched
(Speaking about Berlin)
You never get bothered in the streets, at night or whatever
No fights in clubs, you can go party with your gf and you don't need to be constantly next to her
You can let her dance by herself without getting directly harrassed by a bunch of dudes
Idk if I'll be able to live in France again, you get used very fast to the safety of Germany
C'est choquant de prendre un Uber au lieu de marcher 20 minutes seul dans la nuit ? Je suis un mec et ça me paraissait normal
Good boy !... but you forgot manspreading, feminicide, difference of salaries, etc
You don't learn enough of what TV tells you
The truth is that women like men get messed with in different area
The mentality to think that everything revolves around women and only women is sickening
The most absurd to me about that whole stance is that it claims to be inspired by feminism, with the will to fight against misogyny and machism, while it's inspired of it and renforces it, since it's based on the same principe : " women are weak and need protection".
What is even funnier, is that it's a mentality mostly exclusively shared among heterosexual mens
If you discuss the matter with hetero women, lesbian, homosexual men, none of them believe that about women and who are generaly regarded has manipulative bitch, which is the female counter point of men being violent cunt
Wow, in Sweden ?
One of your stereotyp is to be one of the most "social progress" happy country on earth
>but a lot of people (mostly on the far-left of the political spectrum) can hate you and / or may agress you because of that
Yeah, then they'll burn your kids and drink your blood
Seriously bro
This is a good answer for today in particular
Last time I looked into it, the consensus among the experts in France was that part of these men were after the thrill of making women feel threatened (as it made them feel powerful), and the rest were just extremely lonely people with little to no experience with women
I also remember a piece from a journalist, who made the experiment of going and talking with the men who were catcalling her, and they were mostly sad individuals: the moment she talked to them you could see all their confidence crumble, and those who accepted to be interviewed eventually admitted that they had no idea how to actually engage with women, and that they never met women in a social setting
(btw that is an explanation, not an excuse)
I didn't know Portugal was suffering from the same issue
Sorry for you :/
I ain't a sociologist-anthropologist, but here are my two cents:
I don't think it is so much related to a hormones problem than a cultural one
We've been educated in France (at least, from my point of view) with the idea that freedom of speech is sacred
Hence why there was such an amount of support for Charlie Hebdo after the attacks of 2015
That being said, the cons of this line of thinking, is to tend to think that if a conflict erupts because of something you just said, the culprit would be the recipient not the emitter
To give you an idea, the word "offensive" is pretty much non existent in the French language when talking about verbal or oral speeches
So basically, there's not just a firm conviction in freedom of speech, but a collective sense of entitlement and a complete insensibility to its consequences
Not all of us act this way, but one's got to notice that this mindset is way more present in our country that in others
For me, street harassment is an extension of this issue
Men go after women because they feel its their own right to address anyone in public spaces, especially if said person is hot enough to make a move
They just never compute even once that they can in the best case scenario annoy women, nor do they consider what it would feel like if they were in their shoes
White French men typically like to use migrants or Muslim as culprits for these issues, but the reality is that there ain't a specific demographic group who's reponsible
That being said, depending on the age and social class, there will be different manners to approach a woman, but at the end of the day it remains the same problem
This is just bullshit and quite old now
It comon harassment like you'll find in any big city
Yes painfull but inherently come with condensing big population in small area
They tried to bring awarness to this "menace", but did quite a flop
This mostly concern Paris, but the issue is that when media went there, teh one doing it were mostly immigrant more or less illegal
Lets say bad press for the left cityhall
After that you had a girl whos video went viral after a guy threw at her an ashetray, this was great the guy looked white on the videos, but when he got caught, police realised that it was crazy person
I guess no one can settle on what neoliberalism means, but at least on r/neoliberal, they're *constantly* calling for more housing to be built and rail against restrictions which limit new construction ([example] And I agree with them -- I think most housing shortages are caused by government limitations making building difficult and unprofitable (*edit*), and by established property owners who lobby the government to set those limits
I'm talking about things like zoning laws, height restrictions, rent control, mandatory built-in parking, not-in-my-backyards (NIMBYs) who don't want the "character" of their neighborhood to change, or who don't want their property value to go down, etc
Well, that what happened to me, and a few more people  i know as well
Maybe it's only we're i live, maybe it's just me, but that what happened around me
And despite that and being a night owl, I still dream of moving to Stockholm
(hey, I actually like the rythm of that sentence !)
yeah, once I was partying with some female friends, and one guy offered a beer to one of them
She had the drink directly handed to her without really having any room to refuse it, she looked at me and was like "I'm not gonna drink that" and moved on to just leave it on some table
I was kind of a bit drunk already and I just took the beer and said that if she wasn't gonna drink it then I will because, well, free beer
Damn, it made me pretty drunk/sick, and the morning after I had the worst headache I ever had, lasted two days and ibuprofen was almost useless, felt like shit
I dunno if it was something from that drink but I highly suspect it because I've never been that hungover from beers, and I had some heavy drinking many times
>The mentality to think that everything revolves around women and only women is sickening
That's media propaganda driven by some americain "liberal" lobbies
France is now infested by those since Holland and Berger era
The issue is that, that kind of mentality is percieved in France has communautarism more or less diguise and is in total opposition of our historical universalism vision of humanism
For example before that, dangerous neighbourhoods, the ones where the gentlemen I respond too for examples takes place, were caused by uneducation, pauverity and/or immigration, depending of political view
Now it's caused for media by men
The thing is, the people who are not confronted to it believe media bullshit, the one who are just vote extremist parties who still blames immigration
Well they'll glady tell you they're aware, and even declared "fighting sexism" as the number one mission of their office term, but at the same time their actions are only for show
The budget allocated to equality issues is ridiculous, especially compared to other countries
Probably Brittany
A bit too proud of their own region but pretty nice people overall
Connemara is also really liked in France
I would have said la Réunion, afaik they don't really have any cliché about them, the reputation is pretty fine and all, their food is considered good, most of everybody I know consider them nice
And they don't go everywhere shake a flag to be seen even if it doesn't make sense
(Tbh I kinda like that, but hey)
Do they dislike them a bit in Normandy ? My brain can't really accept that they are anyone in France that is not hated at least a bit by another Frenchman .
i know that place only because of "that" song
À l'aise Breizh

My brother lives in Warsaw and lately he complains that he has to take his car battery home every day, otherwise it dies overnight
It's crazy that it's so cold in Warsaw now (not insane cold like in Yakutsk but still, a solid -12˚C), and here it Lyon we had like +15˚C last Saturday, when it looked like we were on Mars due to the Sahara sand
It's like a 2 hours flight between the two cities
We have some legacy database with keys in French, the rest of the codebase is french-rigid english, so are comments and documentation
I write everything in english: code, comments, and commit messages
Programmers who use french are usually seen as inexperienced
Is that a brand new 2020 joke ?
And it comes from an Italian ?
"all french i've ever met", "exclusively able", "nothing else", "such pricks", "very angry"… Another Italian found red-handed exagerating ?
Come on bro, not even a single one ? Even arrogant French people would give more credit to Italy
I feel like it got better in France
It was considered super cheap and low quality, it's still considered cheap but it's much more socially acceptable to go there IMO
In France Lidl is seen as the bottom of the bottom
The place where homeless people go
When you go to Lidl you feel like you failed at life
Horrible products, bad quality
It's cheap, but the reasoning is important
They chose to have little products but they buy in bulk
So it's good product, but they leave the floor pallet board and don't care too much about the presentation
I don't shop there, but last time I was in one, there was a soldering mask, it was hilarious
It's seen as cheap shit, a store selling producs of very low quality
It's low end, the lowest of the low
And it's not even that cheap compared to the rest
Yes, but it's still as a "low-cost" brand, just not a terrible one
I kinda get the feeling that it's still shit tiers (the prepared food seems awful, tried a pizza once, never again), but increasing precarity of our population made it acceptable
Picard is pretty good IMO, a bit pricy tho
I personally really like it
I think they have variety and good products, for both ingredients and pre-made meals
I find it very convenient to have nice meals available with almost no preparation needed, that you can basically keep in your freezer for as long as you need
I wish I had a bigger freezer to store a lot more
It's not necessarily more expensive than at supermarkets (at least where I live), and they also have good budget stuff
I suspect that's because they don't have a lot that they throw away, since everything is frozen anyway
Picard is great
I shop there all the time and it’s sometimes hard to believe some of their stuff is frozen food
There's one in the my department, never went there, never will i imagine
Didn't even knew it existed
I wouldn't know, I haven't bought from Findus in a while (they don't have their own stores that I know of, Findus is one of the many brands you find in supermarkets)
Definitely
Yes we can
It would be weird otherwise
Yeah they can, there is a few people thinking that they cant but they’re a minority
Well, back in the days when you still had a landline and no caller id, French were saying "Allo".
Now with smartphones, if it is a known number I either just say allo or  answer something like "hey [insert caller's name], what's up
If it is an unknkown number, I let it go to voicemail
"Allô ?"
Then common greetings, and then you start to talk
I still say "Oui, allô ?" a lot
I still say "Allô ?" every time someone answers, because it's quicker than "hey why are you calling me"
Don't you ever say "hallod
I say it the other way around « allô oui
». But only if I don’t know the number
Is the caller is on private, then I let them go to voicemail
Absolutely no other other use of Allo than picking up the phone
You may use allo as a passive agressive way to request attention from someone, but it is, let's say, directly derived from the phone usage
That's so impolite
Better hope it's not an important call XD
Köszönöm a felvilágosítást :)
The French Kingdom exists since Clovis I coronation at Reims, baptizing the kingdom to the christian church, which was on Christmas of 496
The actual name of our country now is "République française" so French republic, and that exists since the 22 september of 1792, the first day of the first republic
It depends
496 was when the Franks started blobbing in Western Europe ; 843 was when they fucked up their succession lawq and West Francia (Future France) was created
I mean, it's not that hard to take Primogeniture smh
around 500 i think, after the fall of the Roman Empire maybe
Officially 1792, but it's actually a bit more complicated
"France" is a very generic term that was used on many occasions but did NOT referred to the same entity
The Kingdom of France is not the same thing as the French Republic (despite having mostly the same land and people)
France is also not the same thing as Francia or Frankish Empire
As of today, we are the French Republic, not the Kingdom of France
As such, it was founded in 1792, during the French Revolution
You can be even more precise, as 1792 refers to the First Republic
We are actually at the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958
The Kingdom of France is old, and the Frankish Empire even older, you can travel back to \~1500 years
you guys are pure vikings
To go in further detail
The start of it being called The Kingdom of France (as opposed to "Kingdom of the Franks", which is still what Germans call us, guess they never got that memo) is under Philippe-Auguste in the late 12th century, with 1204 often being seen as the key date, because the official documents which officialized Normandy's attachment to the kingdom call it "The Kingdom of France".
If you want to be more nitpicky and just look at the current regime, then your date is 1958
either 816 or 62 years old
Vercingétorix  in -52 ?
Charlemagne is not seen as France's founding father
We just question the notion that he was more German than French (he was neither), but the "founder" of France would either be Clovis or Philippe-Auguste, depending on how you look at it
It did
Two different monarchies actually
It was also first an Empire under Napoleon I, then again under Napoleon III, then it was no longer a Republic (just a "State") under Pétain
The XIXth Century really was mostly Empires for France, with some monarchies and a brief Republic (1848-1852) before the IIIrd Republic settled in the 1870s.
There's really no possible way to claim Vercingétorix has anything to do with France really, aside from living in a place that would later be part of it
He's as French as Caesar is Italian, which is to say not at all (though "Italian" actually existed as a word during Caesar's time, so maybe not the best comparison now that I think of it)
Clovis is the farthest back you can possibly go, and even that is stretching it quite a bit
He was never crowned and died in exile in Austria
Napoleon III was his nephew and skipped his number out of respect
Same story with Louis 18, his nephew who would have been Louis 17 was never crowned and died in jail as a child
"If you believe it then it can fit", a famous saying in my family, usually said when going to ikea with a single car
Renting once or twice a year a truck to get this kind of stuff is way way way cheaper than buying a truck
So when I do to DIY, I go with renting
And by the way, drywall are not so common in europe, at least in france
If this don't fit in the car, you can rent a truck or a van at every supermarket (Carrefour, Leclerc, Auchan)
And if you buy at IKEA for example, they have a delivery service
Most people just open the trunk so the stuff can fit and they attach it
It's not like I need big items everyday, if I ever need any I just get them delivered at home by the store or rent a van for a couple hours if it's not possible
The lack of popularity of pickup trucks in Europe also stems from cultural aspects
First of all, it's about fashion
«bulky» stuff is not appreciated here, «bigger is better» is not valued in Europe
Just look at car designs from the past decades and you will see American cars look nothing like European ones, probably because US roads are wider, given that space is not a problem over there
I also think having a truck appeals to the American value of mobility, when it's expected to quickly uproot yourself and move to another state on the other side of the continent
Europe doesn't have that mentality, even though it has started to change with how the EU evolves
I know a lot of people owning a van
And you can rent one too quite easily
Deliveries are sometimes free for bulky and expensive items (like couches)
\- On the car's roof or inside with the seats folded and the car boot door open
\- rent a van, it's about 40 euros for a day
\- delivery, it's not that expensive (I paid 70 euros for my big sofa) and they take your old stuff back
\- borrow or rent a van from someone else (you have lots of app for  neighbour  to help each other like: I use your van for a morning, in exchange you can use my drill or give your kid maths lessons)
\- If you want to donate some old big fournitures, some charity associations can come to take it with their own truck
I renovate houses in France countryside without a car (or licence) i get everything delivered at once
Like "guibot mat" here ibn Normandy
Once you plan everything it's pretty simple but you need a place stock them
Last time I did 9T gravel, 300m² of insulation 350m² of plaster board and it costed 0€ for it
Better get some friends to help

I like how you bothered to Google the image and paste the link and write 3 sentences instead of adding "in English" to your Google search
That's dedication

They have van rentals and fuel stations, like most other french supermarkets
Most of them are also getting equiped with drives (order your groceries on internet) and proximity carrefours are on Uber eats
Merci, merci
Je finirai simplement par dire que j'aime mettre mon pénis dans un yaourt
I don't think anyone on either side of the Atlantic really considers Quebec as french
We have the same language but they are their own thing
It's like England and Australia
They're not really considered french or part our culture, they're seen as our cousins from Canada with a funny accent
They are North Americans\* who speak French, the cultural barrier is pretty much there
We do share a common history and plenty of French people live and work there though
We are closer to them in some way than other French speaking countries around the globe (not counting Belgium or Switzerland which are right next door)
The language has become its own thing, it's French but absorbed a lot of English into it, just like the French spoken in Western Africa absorbed a lot of local languages
It's somehow hard for the untrained French ear to grasp everything that's being said
They are an old colony the English stole, we will take it back one day, and reinstate de King of France, and live just like the good old days
Vive le Québec libre
For real though, as a French who lived 4 years in Quebec, I can say that except for the language, we barely have anything in common, but it’s not a bad thing
We like each others
If for exemple a French tourist is visiting Thailand, and see a Quebecois tourist, they will most likely have a conversation and a drink, because we have this link, we’re cultural cousin
Je vous aime les Quebs, gros bec
They are our cousins from the other side of the pond, Quebec and Quebecois have an extremely positive image in France, I think I really never heard anything negative about Quebec in the everyday chit-chats, there are even some people who developed a kind of fascination for Quebec
I think the Quebecois' opinion about France and the French is more nuanced, for historical reasons of course (we kind of a abandoned them to their fate)
There is a bunch of Quebecois artists who regularly expand their audience to France, because, well, a 60 million audience pays better than a 8 million audience
I have no idea if French artists actively seek to be present in Quebec
I know some went back and forth like standup comedian Gad Elmaleh
Really positive about it, I really like the diversity of the french language
Althought I have the feeling that Quebec people are more used to hear french from france than French are used to hear french from quebec
I feel like I'm saying french/france a lot in this comment but I cannot do much about it
Love Québec but I definitely feel culturally closer to countries like Germ\*ny or Engl\*nd, Québec is closer to Canada to it is to France
I read somewhere that the Quebecois accent many people make fun of could be in fact the way people used to talk in France in the early 1600'.
Hehe, it's funny because the Brits genuinely think Australian culture is close to British culture
Little do they know
This is an old Normand accent, more or less
They're not looked down upon at all, the accent is considered funny but that's it
Lol, what a weird dude
True, true, but they will say "bullshit" (connerie), "joke " (blague), "nice" (sympa), their group of friends is a "gang" and on Friday nights they go to "parties" (fêtes)
Also they use a lot of expressions that are direct translations from English and that don't really make sense for a Frenchman
Saying "c'est correct" is translated from "it's okay", "bienvenue " for "you are welcome " .
Quebequois often pride themselves in being a dam against the prevalence of the English language and will taunt the French by saying that we incorporated a shitton of English words in our language,  which is true (eventhough those English words have been bastardized by the French users and usually make zero sense for an English speaker)
But the Quebequois are direct neighbors to the US and their English speaking citizens in Canada, so of course the way they talk is directly influenced by the English language
For me it's really the use of English words (said with perfect English accent) that I find off-putting, my brain has a hard time to understand the mix of the two languages
In France when we say an English word it's with a thick French accent, it has almost become a French word at this point
Because as an American you are used to stressed words
French québécois is like old french with english stresses, so I guess for you it would sound more natural than for us
Yes, long overdue my dear Rosbif
Bwahahaha, I just spent 1
5 year working there, after 15 years in London, and you’re totally delusional mate
I know you’re told about great empire stories, and to be fair Australians like to keep the link alive, but it’s a very very different culture
The way they interact and behave is on the opposite end of the cultural spectrum, if you’re interested I can tell you more
I heard some Flemings can speak a couple words in French once they notice you're French and not Walloon
Indeed, they have plenty of funny cursed words centered around religion, which is not a thing in France
It’s Jeanne d’Arc you moose
Nounou (pronounced noo-noo in English) is probably the more commonly used term
Babysitter in France usually implies a short term thing, like watching the kids for an evening occasionally, whereas the nounou takes care of your kids daily for an extended period of time
Does tata means anything
Because in french it means aunty
Ah interesting
We call that “tétine” (probably from téton, meaning nipple)
(Or "téter," to suckle)
As weird as it sounds, No cooking class in France ! Sometimes we might go out with the school to learn how to make some bread or some jam basic stuff
But the cooking is to be learnt at home !
Not at all
I remember baking classes at the rec center in summer
And it was more for fun than for learning
No, that sounds very odd
Actually until now I thought cooking classes in school were like super weird
Like
why ?
My parents taught me basic cooking, sewing, and how to use tools
It was only very basic (my mum doesn't like to cook, and for everything else they wouldn't have thought to teach me if I didn't ask about it - mainly because they themselves *had* classes on these subjects as kids) and I learned most of the "advanced" stuff by myself when I was a student
I'm still lucky since even in primary and middle school I had noticed that lot of my classmates had never used a screwdriver
It's basic life skills that everyone should know, no reason to not learn it at school (especially since my CE1 teacher would make lessons about things like "how to fill a check"... Why that and not other useful skills that are not taught in school
Well some school have people from the outside come and do some intervention about eating well
But no school program about how to eat properly
We have maybe a few classes about activities or we learn about calories and that you don't have too eat too much but not specific programs
The way a child learns about nutritionism is exclusively at home, like for me I know my parents made us eat a certain way that I thought was a good one but actually wasn't that great
But yeah I mean in France we eat generally  good i'd say
but like everywhere some people can't afford to eat well
Sorry to disappoint :/
Read my other comment
I am against it
A good part of integrating well into the country is by frequenting people of the country
If you don't speak the language you will only be able to frequent people from your country of origin and I feel like we have way too much of that already
I'm going to say it depends on the situation
If the country in question offers support and lessons to said person to learn the language then I believe they should speak the language to ask for citizenship since an entire system has been created to support people moving in
I am currently facing this problem with my husband
France has a great system in place allowing foreigners to learn French and providing lessons to them which I find to be a great initiative
Except it doesn't apply to Europeans
And since the UK is still kinda in Europe, he can't benefit from this but still would love to be able to learn French
Bit of a missed opportunity there
I think that a high level in the language of the country, and a basic knowledge on the country's history and culture should be required to receive the citizenship
Ya wot mate
Ya avin a giggle
The law is different between arts, science and software
Also there are different kind of Creative Commons licenses, and not all of them forbid to sell the thing
Copyright laws are not the default in Europe
In France (and afaik everywhere else in Europe including Romania and Cyprus), the ownership belongs to the creator by default, with the exception of huge productions like movies where there isn't only one creator
Afaik Ireland uses Copyright but the rest of Europe uses a different system for art (something similar to copyright still applies to computer programs though)
There are both author's moral rights and author's patrimonial rights
The latter is very similar to copyright and clearly states that by default the patrimonial ownership of a piece of art belongs to its creator (patrimonial ownership includes the right to make money from it)
The international copyright treaties make it so that if let's say something is produced in Canada then the Canadian law about it applies even for exploitation outside of Canada
It doesn't make the copyright the same everywhere
In summer solstice, not spring
My high school had a tradition of organizing a strike in front of the school
Full French education heh
But I think it's just a local tradition
We were usually blocking the entrances, then we would trash each others with flour and eggs (and any teacher we could get our hands on)
We never had any demand for that strike as far as I am aware
We didn't think about that part
It degenerated in my senior year (for the first time police was dispatched to observe and someone egged them
Leading to reinforcements and the full French strike experience)
Ignoring each other and being respectful, not doing noise
this sort of stuff
Obligatory:
* « Hello » when you cross one in the common area
* trying to limit noise at sleepy time and warning ahead of time if you really have to make noise at sleepy time
If you want to go the extra mile you can also:
* exchange numbers which has to only be used very rarely and only for neighborly matters
* receive parcels for them if you are there and they aren’t when the postman comes, it saves them a redelivery / having to go queue at the post office to retrieve their parcel
You can be friends with you neighbor if you want but it is not required or expected
In France, it depends on where you live:
\- In the cities, Like Toulouse, Marseille or Lyon, you rarely know your neighbors
Paris is the worst case of that because everybody seems to hate each other constantly so it's a bit different
Anyway, in the cities your neighbors are just people that live her, you say hello to them while in the elevator and that's all for the most
\- In the smaller towns, (Around 50k/100k hab for example), like Cannes or Toulon, it's a bit different
In the center, you act almost like every big city, but when you start to get away from the center, usually you start knowing them a bit
You trust them enough to keep an eye on your garden while you're away, sometimes discuss with them, help each other with gardening
You're not "Friends", but you have a good relationship
\- In the small villages (I talk about th ones under 5000 people), you know your neighborhood
The smaller the town the better you know them
You do activities with them
As a child, you know every other child in the neighborhood/village
You don't like everyone of course, but you can be friends with most of them pretty naturally, and it's completely normal
In cities: avoid eye contact, small hello (if they say "bonjour" and it's already late, reply "bonSOIR"  (good evening) wich a sadistic voice)
Small talk only if you feel weirdly happy that day or if you are forced
Take the stairs if they were first on the elevator
Countryside: friendly but secretly hate them because the cousin of their grand-mother's great oncle stole your great grand-father's mushroom secret spot
I live in a small building in a residential area  with only six units, and I know  all my neighbors
My next door neighbors have become friends over the years, and we sometimes socialize while respecting each other’s privacy
With the others, we only exchange pleasantries (Hellos, How are your, etc)
As for my other neighbors who live in my street, I hardly know them, but it’s polite if you meet someone on the sidewalk to smile and say hello
It is most of the time
Happened to me to have a neighbor with a dog that was barking from 7:00 am to 22:00 pm earlier this year, a real pain
But after complaining to the owner and syndicate managing the building, it calmed down a notch to finally end completely 1 month and a half later
I don't know if it's because the puppy grew bored out of it or something else but it's nice, at least
25 minutes in the subway
It used to be 45 min to 1 hour in bus but I moved
I could never imagine how much difference these 20 minutes of commute made in terms of mood, tiredness and motivation at work
I just feel so much better all around
10mn bus, 35mn train, 15mn bus / 25mn walk
I often choose to walk from the station to the office, as I don't mind being 10mn late
I can sit in the train and watch movies on my phone, so it's fine by me
5 minute walk ! I live really close to my university
2 min by foot :)
20 minutes walk or 10 minutes bus ride
Depends
If i’m staying at my parents’ it’s a 5 minutes walk to a tram station, 10 minutes tram ride to a trainstation, 35 minutes train ride to the center of Paris, 10 minutes walking in the Paris trainstations to catch the metro, 7 minutes of metro and a 5 minutes walk to school
It takes about 1h20 from door to door
When at my appartment I walk 7 minutes to the metro station, take a metro for 15 minutes then another one for 10 minutes and the 5 minutes walk to school
So about 35 munutes door to door
And when there’s a strike, I walk there and it takes about 45 minutes
I've been working with a lot of Irish people lately and I absolutely love their names
Saoirse, Caoimhe, Ruairi, Niamh, etc
They were a bitch to learn how to pronounce though lol
Agreed
Friedrich is
Dominique is unisex in French, so you've got your male example already
It even comes [with its own song] what more could you ask for
What are the faux-Greek French names
I’m very curious :)
Aaah oui
Je n’y avais jamais pensé ! Anatole aussi

My own dad told me he'd kick me out once I turn 18
He ended up leaving when I was 16
He was a total POS to me so good riddance
France is often mocked to surrender but it’s the country which won the most battles and had the greatest general of all time
Also, in WW2 the battle of Pont-Saint-Louis engaged 9 French against 3000 Italians and French won ( even after the government surrendered like cowards )
So it was you
"Surrendered like cowards" is knowing nothing about the history
France was defeated and had no choice but to surrender
The army prepared for a WWI episode 2 they got a WWII
There was no cowardice in surrendering bevaise there was no choice, the gouvernment cannot refuse peace like de Gaulle did because the gouvernment cannot flee from its own territory has the Pols proved
Moreover the actions led by le Régime de Vichy after the armistice were horrible, an eternal shame to the country but still does not fit the word "coward".
Napoléon won the most battle, that was the meaning of the sentence
We did the same error in both WW, this time error was fatal French army was strong as hell but the shit government acted like cowards to me
They did exactly what France shouldn’t have done
Now France is seen as a weak country
[This video shows how many battles generals in history won]
And fought 6 continental coalitions, yeah
First Coalition (1792–1797): Austria, Great Britain, Spain, and Prussia variously were in or out of this coalition against Revolutionary France
The coalition collapsed with General Napoleon Bonaparte’s success in Italy that led to the Treaty of Campo Formio
The most important battle was probably the Battle of Lodi (May 10, 1796)
Second Coalition (1799–1802): Britain, Austria, and Russia, which were unhappy with French expansion, were the main culprits here
Napoleon was in Egypt for part of this time, winning the Battle of the Pyramids and establishing modern Egyptology, but he hastened back in 1799 and took control of France as First Consul
His campaign in Italy, mostly against the Austrians, was highlighted by the Battle of Marengo (June 14, Third Coalition (1805): Fearful of an expanding France, Britain, Austria, and Russia formed the Third Coalition, but Austria and Russia were soundly beaten at the Battle of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)
The ensuing treaty ended hostilities for only a short time
Third Coalition (1805): Fearful of an expanding France, Britain, Austria, and Russia formed the Third Coalition, but Austria and Russia were soundly beaten at the Battle of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)
The ensuing treaty ended hostilities for only a short time
Fourth Coalition (1806–1807): Russia and Britain were still at war with France, and Prussia jumped into a new coalition
But the Prussians and Russians were soundly drubbed at the Battle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), effectively ending hostilities
Fifth Coalition (1809): Once again, the Austrians and British (these guys just don‘t give up, do they
) joined forces to try to throw Napoleon out of France
And once again, Napoleon thumped the Austrians, this time at the Battle of Wagram (July 5–6, 1809)
But the Brits were getting active in Spain, and the handwriting was on the wall
Sixth Coalition (1812–1814): Russia betrayed Napoleon, and the resulting hostilities led to Napoleon’s invasion of Russia and victory at Borodino (September 7, 1812)
But Napoleon’s withdrawal from Russia opened the floodgates, and one by one his allies became former allies and members of the Sixth Coalition
Napoleon’s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig (October 16–19, 1813) sealed his fate, and in 1814 he was exiled from France (as Emperor of Elba)
Seventh Coalition (1815): Napoleon’s return to France in March 1815 for a second reign as emperor (dubbed the Hundred Days to indicate its duration) caused all his old enemies to unite against him, with final defeat coming at Waterloo (June 18, 1815)
That was it for Napoleon, who was exiled to the island of St
Helena, where he died on May 5, 1821
There is a small village in the US, Castroville (TX), where there are native speakers of Alsatian
Alsatian is an alemanic dialect from the Alsace region in eastern France
It is spoken by less than a million people
Here is an example of a real Alsatian with an alsatian speaker from Castroville, both speaking Alsatian: [
Eating Frogs
Many foreigners think that every French home has a [*bidet*] in the bathroom
It is not the case, they are actually quite rare
We barely eat frog's legs
First time I tried it was in China
France:
Food: onion soup, snails and frogs, brie cheese (brie is common but often seen as not to tasty and very cheap, mostly eaten at schools/hospitals etc)
Also: berret, very good looking/elegant women, babies that don't throw food, smart cars, topless at beach, "french" toast
We wear berets and eat snails
Only the elders still wear berets and snails are eaten only at Christmas and personally I don't like
I went to Poland for a holiday a few years ago, and I didn't get the impression that religion was everywhere, that you were very religious or conservative
But while we were hiking around Zakopane on a sunday morning, I remember arriving in a village where there was no one on the street
They were all at an open-air mass 300m away
I don't know what's with tourists really, we get people asking where to find weed on /r/paris very often
, asking for numbers and so on
Alright, alright, weed is pretty prevalent here but you're not gonna give phone numbers to some random person online
> Car accidents
Yes, we all know the dascham videos, but no, not every drive in Russia is so weird or epic and not every Russian driver is so bad
I always knew it was just the best-of-the-best shitshow we got to see but I still wanna hope that you are lying and Russia is filled with epic stories about drivers doing whatever
It'd be way funnier
That's still more than most people
> Germans apparently loves to use lots of physical pieces of paper for some reason
So that's where the whole "Franco-German Friendship" comes from, the love-hate of administration papers
That one is true
You can find snails in many restaurants but, as far as I know, it’s quite uncommon to consume them at home
For example, I (26 years old), have eaten snails less than 10 times in my life and always at a restaurant
Again, this may vary from person to person
There are guidebooks to France that describe bidet
(I didn't check the Italy counterparts
Except the mimes
And the béret
Saying "bon appétit": yep
Saying "bonjour" a lot: yep (you greet strangers/acquaintances more than in the US, though it kinda depends on context)
béret: not super common, but more common than in the US
blue-and-white striped shirt: not super common, but more common than in the US
rudeness: a little in Paris, otherwise not so much
fashion -- yes
cheese and wine -- YES
man walking down the street with a bag of ten baguettes -- YES
Ok but what about that:   ?
I think it's a papist invasion
I'm 35, I've never eaten frogs and snails maybe twice
Well, bidet is a French word, so we did have some  in the old days
Current fashion is to get rid of bidets if modernising an old bathroom
True, administration in France in a fucking nightmare ...
They're molluscs
They mostly taste like seafood, but less salty
Yet Galicia has the perfect weather to produce them in large numbers
Bidet are really useful tho, we should keep them instead of getting rid of them in "modern" bathroom
#savethebidet
Almost every Christmas and almost never outside of Christmas and new year's eve
The Entente Cordiale, the document which turned the Franco-British relationship into a friendly one, was created to justify why Edward VII kept on going to Paris
Truth is, he just went there to bone prostitutes
Very few French people can tell how the IIIrd Republic came to be, which is a shame since it was the first true republican regime for France that lasted more than few years (we are talking about you, Ist and IInd Republic)
(my apologies in advance for grammar mistakes)
So, at that time, there was a huge debate on whether the French should adopt the republican regime or the monarchist one
After the end of Napoleon III and the Second Empire in 1870, the French people were really divided on should they reconciliate with the monarchy, and adopt a constitutional monarchy with a parliament, or should they definitively abandon the idea and create the IIIrd Republic
The provisional parliament tends to be in favour of the monarchy, but the big question was which house
Since the bonapartist house wasn't really popular (1870 war, defeat of Sedan, that sort of things), the two competitors were the Bourbon house (a.k.a. the legitimist, since they were the royal family of France before the 1789 revolution) and the Orléans house (more progressist than the legitimist, thanks to the moral legacy Louis-Phillipe I, not king of France but king of the French ; a massive difference that made him closer to the people)
Members of each house were fighting for the French crown, when the orleanist got a brilliant idea
The suitor for the crown from the legitimist faction was Henri, Count of Chambord
He was very old and didn't have any son, or heir
The orleanist strategy was to let Henri rule, dies shortly after and then, based on a previously signed agreement, the Orléans house would be granted the French throne
They asked his doctor how many years he would live, and he replied with "7". So, when the royalist president Patrice de MacMahon was elected, he was destined to rule for 7 years
The seven-year mandate cherished by the French Republic (but not anymore since 2000) was created
The orleanist however encountered an issue
Henri, Count of Chambord didn't want only the French throne and the return to the monarchy (which was already A MIRACLE), he also wanted the return of the royalist flag, white with golden fleur de lys
Outrageous for the people who fought and died for this flag for nearly 80 years
Every single royalist, legitimist or orleanist, tried to convince the Count of Chambord to change his mind
A flag combining both the tricolor and the royalist coat of arm was even proposed but nothing could change the mind of Henry
This angered the French people and when the next elections arrived, a decisive republican victory definitively buried the hope of a second restauration
TL;DR: France didn’t turn into a constitutional monarchy because of an old fart who wanted his old flag back
This is also how potatoes were introduced in France
I don't believe either story tbh
Which is false, the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland have already been around for 80 years when you signed your treaty
France never renonced it
Nah, a few clauses have been used (right for a French to live in Scotland for example) until 1909 when the ENGLISH parlement abolished it
Scotland or France never officialy stopped the Alliance
It's technically still in place
I would like to see my government pushed for a New referendum for our oldest allies
Might be wrong, but I never seen buckwheat crêpes outside France
Also I thought for a long time that "galette des rois" was a international tradition
Bread
But, *actually good* bread
We have "Champomy" which is pretty similar and popular at kids parties
I love this shit
In the Brittany region in France it's extremely popular, to make the local pancakes
I mean in every town you can find several restaurants serving almost exclusively buckwheat pancakes ! Not popular at all in the rest of the country though
In France we do it, but not with every stranger, and depending on the region it's a different number of kisses, but nobody ever knows how many so it's a mess and you have to agree on a number before of while kissing cheeks
Wait, "galette des rois" isn't eaten in other historically catholic country ?!
Myeaaah kind of
Champomy is closer to cider than it is to Apfelschorle I guess
Ça veut dire maïzena ?
But do you eat savoury crêpes ? (With things like ham, eggs, cheese
We call the continent Oceania and the country Australia but since it's pretty much the same thing we often say Australia
Sarrasin/blé noir :)
Ah oké merci
I have always seen it as a thing you were supposed to wait for the host to tell you (something like "here is the place for the shoes") the first time you enter someone's home
Next times you usually can take them off without asking
I am a simple man, give me a simple blowtorched crème brûlée and I will die a happy man
The [Millefeuille] is a french pastry invented in Dijon, during the 17th century
Of course there are so much more amazing desserts that I can't think of
[Lemon Meringue Pie] is probably my favorite, and surprisingly easy to make at home
I have it almost every year for my birthday and bake it several times a year for special occasions
Chocolate éclair
And Paris-Brest but it's not always available in the stores
this is delightful
Ah it is soooo good
Oh mämmi looks very intriguing, thanks for sharing it here ! I'll wait for my next holiday to prepare some, since it takes 4 days to make
Apart from kladdkakor and all the bullar you guys have, I really liked [Princesstårta] on occasions, with its original bright green icing !
Yes, delicious when done well
The origins are discussed though, so not sure it is 100% French
You don't like profiteroles
Probably in my top 3 with a crème brûlée and a millefeuilles
Paris-Brest beats everything
I miss it so much
Millefeuilles > all
>bread with marmalade and cheese
Sir that's a sin
There's also the [Kouign Amann] which seems to be very well-known among the French, but practically unheard of abroad
You could swear it was something straight up from an "Epic Meal Time" episode
It's also fairly easy to make if you've already done puff-pastry dough, the only difference being that with every fold you make on the dough, you add sugar
I am not a sweet food person
I mainly like crème brûlée and good flan
Anything with crème pâtissière is a no go for me
You seem to be very much into ganache
My favorite super fattening dessert is banoffee pie, it’s just so good but it’s concentrated fat and sugar
I think it's almost more popular in France than in Italy lol
When I was living in Umeå, I remember someone telling me it's more of a Norrland dessert, is it true in your experience ? Or is it maybe more holiday-related too in the rest of the country ?
Man kan ju inte köpa prinsesstårta här, men jag har precis i dag bakat råg knäckebröd ! Det finaste som finns i den svenska gastronomin tycker jag !
Respectable of course, but still a pity
It is not about who's first, it is about the one who has brought it to the next level
I don’t really see why
Pourquoi vous vous parlez pas en français c'est pas comme ça qu'on va préserver notre belle langue
I honestly don't know the origins of the profiterole, I just know I enjoy so much eating them
And it is just in about any restaurant menu in France
Indeed during the 17 and 18th centuries, Europe was probably even more a thing than today
The royal alliances influenced every countries' cultures
There are some variations of the filling
Usually it is a kind of custard /pastry cream, but nowadays it is often filled in with vanilla icecream
You can also find a kind of chantilly cream filling
The constants are the ball shape choux, and the hot melted chocolate
Everyone is speaking in English, it’s an international forum of discussion
I didn’t realize our language was on the brink of disappearance
That the Maginot line was useless and the Fench were surprised by the invasion of Benelux
TLDR is that the objective of the line was dissuasion and for various reasons, fighting the Germans in Belgium was planned but not so much a breakthrough through the Ardennes
well
do i really have to explain
History have been manipulated by anglos
US and UK supported germany during the 1870 war
And after that anglophile put us in WW1 and we lost 1
7 millions lives
After WW1 we have been accused of making the treaty of Versaille to hard but they don't said that initially Germany was supposed to be balkanised but US and UK refused
Then they supported german during all 1920', 1930' with many investments in their industry against France
After WW2 they wanted France to be a colony of USA
Liberation is only a recent word
They talked about "invasion" in 1944
Hopefully the anglo plan have been blocked
No, we didn't give up during WW2
We simply got destroyed
Also Portugal is just the Latin name of Porto, Portus Cale (the Duchy of Porto who gained independence from Leon)
That France just rolled over instead of fighting during the battle of France
The battle of France was short but very intense actually and the Germans had nearly 90k men killed and more than 100k wounded, they also lost 25% of their tanks, 35% of their aircrafts and more than 1000 qualified pilots, all that in five weeks
The planes were replaced with time but the lack of qualified pilots is one of the reasons they lost the Battle of Britain against the Royal Air Force
The German very rarely had air superiority after Battle of Britain as the allies constantly could field many more aircrafts at any given time because they didn’t lose a ton of pilots at the start
France did many stupid strategic and political mistakes causing a rapid defeat but the troops on the field often fought hard despite being often cut off from their hierarchy and encircled
Never did that
More wars probably, more battles certainly
You guys are second if my memory serve me correclty
But we cheated we always had more neighbours than you
The Algerian and Vietnamese wars are not "major" wars on the international level, they were wars of independence
The French population no longer cared about the colonies, and I am glad that we have "lost" these wars
These wars represent a political abandonment of the French colonial empire by the representatives, not " crushing " defeats
Ex: The Algerian war leaded to the 1962 Algerian independence referendum
Well "saving" Europe and being as evil as Nazi Germany aren't exclusive
Yeah it was a county my bad, but still Portugal comes from Portucale, the city of Porto
The main reason is Gamelin was a shit commander who did not bother liaising with our Belgian allies until right before German invasion, changed plans at the last minute and had retarded ideas like not trusting radio and instead relying on motorcycle dispatches to send orders while German high command was fully equipped with radio in every tank
He managed to get the whole allied army encircled in the first weeks of the battle leading to a hasty retreat to avoid losing literally the whole army
Politically the Reynaud government was pretty pro war but they made the mistake of bringing in Petain (who was then a military legend) to try and rally the troops, Petain then basically sabotaged the whole thing by calling for the troops to lay down their arms and stop fighting without consulting anyone
That's strange, the English Wikipedia article says 27k dead Germans, the French article says between 27k and 63k.
I've noticed similar differences on other articles about other battles
What could cause such a difference between languages ? Sources ?
And they cheated by fighting third world country
I mean India got you one bajillion war on your counter, but you're right
Yes, central heating from wood stove at my parents
This is one of those rural/urban divides where we just can't understadn each other I guess
In my area, wood pellet stove are getting popular
It's a stove with a thermostat, and can automatically start and stop
It also have a large block of stone to store heat, giving a lot of inertia to the system
It's a largely forested area, artificial pine forest, so the pellets come from residues from wood industry
Instead of transforming electric power into heat, it pumps calories from outside inside your house
In temperate climate, it's quite efficient
We learned that it really was a bad idea to try to invade Russia in Winter
And well not really a force for good since the whole Europe hated us
"We brought freedom to the world"
In school we learn about napoleon, but tbh not enough I think around 1 or 2 lessons while it's one of the most important period of history
The school system portrays him as someone incredibly smart especially internally
I personnally think he is one of the most interesting and smartest person in the world history
And our empire led by him was a force for good according to me (ww1 or ww2 probably wouldnt have happened if he had succeeded)
I'm pretty sure the ideals of the french revolution were more a force for good than the ideals of the monarchy that were carried by the austrian russian and english
The macedonian empire lasted for so little time that you can't really say tbh
Ye the big mistake was probably waiting a month in Moscow for the Russian surrender that never came
But isn't the lingua franca there because of the usa ?
I mean if it wasn't for the USA becoming such a powerhouse the world would probably not have a lingua franca
I know the usa was a british colony but let's be honest it's a very small part of the british history
lol no
Comparing evils is never a good idea, but the brits were not better or worse than the rest
That beliefs is yet another false facts taught to the brits on the topic
Who attacked who ?
The british empire wasn't as bad as the nazi
But it for sure was really really bad on the level of stalin ussr or mao china
Millions of native in america and australia killed willingly through direct means(straight up killing) or indirect means (disease)
Millions of Indian starving to death, the british had one of the richest country on earth (india had like a quarter of the world gdp during the mughal reign) and when they left it the country was ruined
There's many other things ofc (boer war,ireland etc)but wherever the british empire went, things got worse for the population already established, MUCH worse usually
Yeah I mean they were tolerant for the first 300 years so that for sure excuse the many genocide and massacre the empire commited :D
Idk only 12% of indian are english speaker (still enough to make it the 2nd biggest english speaking country in the world tho)
south africa has 31% of their population that speaks english and 10% have it as their first language
And I could give the stats of basically every former colony beside new zeland australia canada and hong kong(hk still have a smaller percentage of english speaker than south korea)  they'd be pretty much the same aka really low
It's fair to say that those number would be much much lower if english wasn't the lingua franca of the world and important for business and science
Which it mostly is because of how important the US influence was on the world
PS: I'm obviously not claiming the english empire didn't help my argument is just that it's influence was smaller than that of the US
PS2: Also it may be a surprise but english is not the only lingua franca in the world  :D french and russian are also lingua franca (if you go to a former ussr country like armenia good luck finding anyone speaking english but everyone will speak russian same if you go to the former french colony in africa)
Right, but of all of these the only one worth doing business with during the better part of a century (and also the time when English became lingua franca) was the USA
As long as it's not used as an excuse to make the brit one look better
All of them were essentially people with guns using their military superiority to plunder other people
A sad indictment of people in those days
But the way we treat it today reflects who we are today
Idk much about British rule in Singapour so I can’t speak about it
The British were good in Hong Kong I can agree with you, also honestly the worst thing they did to Hong Kong was to give it to the Chinese (it wasn’t perfect with many riot occurring but still much better than if it was part of China)
But exemple of 2 small colony don’t really changes much my point still stand
Singapore was a swamp when the Brits left
Now nearby Malaya, that's were the true decolonisation violence occurred
I give it a try :

I lived in Japan for a year so this is a bit cheating bu t off the top of my head:
- Tokyo (Capital)
- Chiba (Close to Tokyo)
- Yokohama (Same, and it's Japan's 2nd city IIRC)
- Saitama (North of Tokyo, still a large city)
- Nagano (In the mountains, no idea how I know it)

- Kita-Kyushu (Literraly means Northern Kyushu, pretty descriptive)
- Fukuoka (Fun and easygoing city in the South
- Itoshima (Small town right next to Fukuoka)
- Nagasaki (The other bombed city
Went there on Aug 9th)
- Kumamoto (Another big city in Kyushu)
- Kagoshima (Another one)
- Miyazaki (or is it a prefecture
Kyushu anyways)
- Naha (Capital of Okinawa, nice castle but such a drab and decaying city
- Ginowan (another city in Okinawa that I visited, not much to do or see)
EDIT: A few others
- Okinawa city, on the eponymous island
- Fuji (the city at the bottom of the mountain)
- Sakai (south of Osaka, close to Kansai Airport)
- Wakayama (South of Sakai, IIRC)
- Otsu (On Lake Biwa, close to Kyoto)
- Fukushima (Obviously)
- Aomori (extreme north of Honshu)
- Otaru (Harbor close to Sapporo
Apparently it's cute but under a blizzard when I went there)
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Saitama, Nagano, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, Kobe, Shizuoka
I can't be forgiven for that
Shame on me
I'm a small weeb, I think I can recognize half the names on that list
Definitely possible that he did not Google depending on the weebness
In France it's **Jacques-Yves Cousteau**, hands down
I mean, he was world-famous for his TV show " [The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau] ", and two movies: "The Silent World" and "World Without Sun".
Although, Gen Z probably never heard about him
&#x200B;
[Jacques Cousteau - Wikipedia]
I would say Jamy Gourmand with "C'est pas sorcier". A famous ~~vulgarisator~~  populariser who made from 1993 to 2014 a total of 599 episodes of roughly 26 minutes explaining different scientific things such as wine making or geological phenomenons
It was intended for the kids but had a lot of very complex concept explained with some amazing handmade models and cheap but funny sounds
Plus the differents reporters used to go to different places to meet the experts and show the phenomenons in action
For my generation it is The ~~emission~~ show we all watched as kids and made some of us love science
> was
Don't you fucking scare me like that
Fun fact 2: most of the music used in his documentaries was composed by [Vangelis]
I don't know what's your generation but it was popular among mine, I'm born in 2002
Though, my younger sister born in 2010 doesn't have something comparable
I’d also think of Stephane Bern, history populariser
Jamy, Marcel, Fred et Sabine
[link] for whoever is interested, I just watched the episode about the Iberian wolves
It is amazing how well it holds up, even more than 40 years later
Wow
I love Vangelis, especially the Blade Runner soundtrack
Also, Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) was the narrator of the English language versions of the show
Those films are still very enjoyable to watch even though they are close to being 50 years old
Thanks for the help
Now that i reread it, sure we do love our nuclear gaz emissions in France, especially during childhood, but it is not the subject here
I was born at the end of the 90's, so we are in the same generation
My brother born in 2011 is a great fan of it
you can find all of them on youtube, and there is a webside that has links for all of the different episodes
you hould try to show it to your sister
Link :
Not for my generation, in my opinion
He died in 1997 so his stuff was more iconic for the earlier generation
I'm sure my parents and grandparents know him and his work
But tbf i never watched a show by Jacques Cousteau so i can't tell if it is iconic
Et la p'tite voix !
Yeah these ones are awesome too
I am a die-hard Blade Runner fan, that's all
Probably Manuel Valls
He's so hated that he left France to live in Spain
If you do say it, be sure not to live in a city with a famous cathedral that has a 123m-tall spire
Well, he's not that vigilant, catching the virus and all
I usually cook them in the oven
You insult us
It's not, Flemish OP is right
I feel like France is doing alone the european military protection and we are kinda also alone trying to make the EU's foreign diplomacy alive
I wish southern europeans countries would be rather on our side than on Germany's one about plenty of topics
To French people, people go to Amsterdam for two reasons: weed and prostitutes
>-The only EU Member to openly hate the French
-We
Only because the UK left the chat
>We let all Europeans drive however the fuck they wish every summer when you all visit us
I mean, we simply adapt to the way locals drive
For the sake of European unity, I will not comment on the wine stuff
> The UK has good intelligence services
That might be the only thing with intelligence left in the UK
Thanks for the wars
I am not so sure all those who voted in favour of Brexit had this in mind
I am under the impression it was more something like "Europe sucks, we pay way too much to the EU, so we want out, bye bye
Oh, economical consequences
What are those
Mali asked military help to France because djihadist militias took over the whole north of the country and were getting closer to the capital
If we didnt helped them we were the bad guys, if we do help them we are the bad guys anyway meanwhile the only military assets going next to Greece when Turkey was flexing around were french warships and hunters aircrafts
But we are the baddies ofc
Why do you think that
Just because there would (should
) be a common EU army for defence doesn't mean countries don't get to have their own national army anymore
Just like space agencies, ESA is European, but France still has CNES as a national space agency
Damn the HRE
I'd rather have an EU army that's strictly defensive
Otherwise it'd be too easy to be used for personal gain by influential country leaders, as you say
The entire point of an EU Army would be to get rid of NATO and American influence on Europe
Not to mention that NATO has been used offensively for unjustified wars too: Afghanistan and Libya are two examples
I agree that an EU army, if it was to be made today, wouldn't be much useful, probably wouldn't deter Russia or Turkey, just look at how unintimidated Erdogan is when the EU gets "angry". But IMO it's something we should work towards
I'm expecting some names such as Phillipe Petain to pop up, but bear with me as I have a little more obscure tale to relate
Back in 1980, during the Cold War, a KGB agent named Vladimir Vetrov came to the French secret services to offer his help
The reasons why he did so remain mysterious, but we know that he wasn't forced to do it, and was a self proclaimed francophile
Over the course of the next two years, he delivered to the French secret services a little less than 3000 pages of classified documents coming from the KGB, all of them shared with the MI6 and the CIA
Including among other things, a list of all Soviet spies set in France, some with an official diplomatic status
The French government expelled the Soviet diplomats quoted in the list without further ado
But here's where the story takes an extremely dark turn: the Soviet ambassador demanded explanations for these actions
Francois Scheer, head of cabinet for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received him and presented the original document with the KGB list
Thanks to this document, the KGB was able to track down in no time who could have had access to it, and found out Vetrov's name
Vladimir Vetrov ended captured, and executed in a prison in Moscow
Meanwhile, Francois Scheer was never inquired for having blown their double agent's cover, even though the French secret services are still mad at him
It is known here as the Farewell case, how one of the biggest USSR traitors created in turn one in our side
Targeting a whole foreign entity instead of a person or a group of persons is quite counterproductive and it's telling, down to the arrogance you mention below
Especially when the traitors are not from your country, your ranks, your blood
I didn't know Czechia was perfect to the point when each individual, at any moment of your whole history, stayed loyal, no matter the circumstances, that you're forced to pick something, someone out of your own
Brilliant
I can't even imagine your feels to be stuck with a whole population of traitors in the EU
Yes they *did*. Quite a few generations occured since then as you may be aware
Where is the limit ? Eternity of autoflagellation for the said country's population
I didn't felt personally attacked, why should I've been ? I would have said the exact same thing if OP attacked a foreign entity on a thread asking you about traitor(s) from your country's history
Targeting someone or something for their guilt instead of your own when asked about your own is just low
> Well, Germany excluding
Just like that
How so ?
The only one I can think of is pretty old, from may or june this year
Our president has let one of his friends disguise as a policeman in order to beat the crap out of protesters back in May
His identity has been revealed since then and we learnt for example in a leaked phone call that he wasn’t afraid of anything because "The boss is behind him"
He’s now pretty serene & his life has not changed much
That piece of shit even challenged a Brazilian MMA fighter to fight him when the former insulted our first lady
That government does not make much sense tbh
It's actually from may 2018
But it's been talked about for more months and it's a big mess so at this point it's hard to follow the exact timeline
Probably the first time I went to Basque Country, in a rural area with my family when I was a child
It was really hard to understand what people were saying
Food, sport and culture were different
Everything was translated in basque
I felt like a foreigner when I arrived
The south of france looks like a different country, it looks more like spain or italy than other parts of france in so many ways
The way that people from Paris says the sound "o". This
It scares me
I had the same in Alsace : the towns, the accent, the regional language
A lot of things were really different there
Yes, some people there speak Alsatian
Used to be the Ministry of Defence (and Ministry of War a long time ago), now called Ministry of the Armed Forces (since 2017)
I don't complain that much
I don't like cheese
I don't like cheese and wine
lol i poured beer into a wine glass at a party the other day to share with a friend, it was no longer sad Aldi "bier" according to him, it became "*Bière*".
I have no words for you
May god have mercy on your soul
Had the same with pastis and rugby in France
I was pretty much forced to drink it, i love it now (and i hate licorice and anis flavored things)
Saoul comme un polonais (Being drunk as a Pole) => being drunk
But in reality, the expression comes from there:
>After a decisive battle of Kozietulski's Polish light horses in Spain in 1808, the heroic survivors of this elite unit were paraded before Napoleon
French generals, jealous and wanting to minimize the role of the Poles, indicated that they were drunk
The Emperor replied: "So, gentlemen, know how to be drunk like Poles
If someone doesn't speak English (or another language well), they'll say they speak it like a Spanish cow
"To speak like a Spanish cow" (France)
Saoul comme un Polonais (Drunk as a Polish)
C'est du Chinois pour moi (this is Chinese to me, means you can't understand any of it)
Branlette espagnole (spanish wank, tittyjob)
C'est Byzance / c'est pas byzance (It's byzantium / it is not byzantium, means it's the height of luxury, it isn't really luxury)
That's "partir à l'anglaise" here, or "leaving the English way".
In France we greet women by kissing them (more like cheek to cheek and kissing the air) except if it's formal (greeting your friend's girlfriend : kiss, meeting your boss for the first time : shake hands)
Some men greet themselves this way as well but it's more rare (mostly family members)
I don't really know about other countries, but in Japan for exemple it's extremely rude
Same in South-western France
not just family, all the close friends
It's weird to shake hands with friends it's so formal
It's really good tho
In France it's controversial on media but we do it often with friends
It's pretty rare but afaik it's ok in France too (at least for my family, and there is a "boucher chevalin" in the market nearby)
Not in France
now you have to explain Pivo and Rohlik
The "Quadrille des Lanciers"  is also danced at the Polytechnique's Prom [with the same touching clumsiness]
Another tradition that I find  cringy is the "game of the garter" at weddings
The reception becomes an auction room
The bride stands on a platform
The guests give money and at each new auction, the bride rolls up her dress a little more
At the end, when her garter is visible, the person who has made the greatest contribution wins the privilege of taking it off
[With the teeth]
I think I'll go for Carnaval in the North of France
I don't think it's very much done anymore though
People use to dress as the opposite sex and meet in front of the mayors hoise
He would then proceed to through buckets of fresh herrings on the crowd with one or two lobsters in there
If you were lucky, you'd catch the lobster
In Belgium I always loved the Gilles
They'd go in the street dressed up in their magnificent costumes and would throw oranges at the crowd
I always remember running and trying to grab one before hiding for a bit
I also remember that through the years it got a bit more sensible so you wouldn't get knocked off your boots by an orange
Never heard of those
Louis Ferdinand Celine is a very well known and very talented French author who is still studied in school, his books are considered classics
He was also extremely antisemitic and was an eager Nazi collaborator
Napoleon
Our boy Napoléon, in reality it was totalitarism
And I think a few ^^^^^^million people too
Capturing Richard the Lionheart was pretty dumb but it somehow worked out in the end
The Austrian Succession War
Well, I was going to say the dumbest thing our country did was Napoleon betraying Spain
Abusing the trust of an ally, pretending to just pass through, and then actually invading the country may be one of the worst dick move in history
Not cool, Bonaparte
Yeah I agree, not renewing the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia was a pretty bad idea
Wilhelm II did so many stupid things
He had too big an ego
are tulips some metaphore about bitcoins ?
What
It's far from being the stupidest thing
It actually prevented the germans from taking control of the fleet
The real dumb thing was Mers el Kebir when the brits asked us to hand over the fleet after our defeat and we refused, so they had to sink it all
I globally agree with everyone else by saying that the Lichtenstein have a very nice car plate design
But I'd like to talk about the french designs, because I think it's funny
Old french plates used to include the département number in the car plate number in order to classify them more easily
And french people got attached to it
You see, France is very xenophobic when they drive and see a bad driver from another département
You wouldn't find any french person that likes the drivers from the Ile de France région (so the départements 75 (Paris), 77 (seine et marne), 78 (yvelines), 91 (essone), 92 (hauts de seine), 93 (seine saint denis), 94 (val de marne), 95(val d'oise))
In the same way, people used to be nicer to corsica's plates (2A and 2B) because of Corsican terrorists (and because Corsicans have a bad rep in metropolitan France)
EDIT: it also makes me think of my grandmother who told me a story of my grandpa when he was a kid
You have to know that the Finistère was very poor after WW2 (and even before tbh)
Many people relied solely on agriculture to live, but they couldn't compete with the industrialised agriculture of the UK (which is just across the channel), so they were economically fucked
Not to mention that the Bigoudens (people from there) were among the poorest peoples on that area
According to my grandma, the only good cars my grandpa saw when he was a kid were from the Morbihan (he could see the 5~~3~~6 in their plates) and they usually got trashed on a regular basis out of spite
That's another example of xénophobie départementale
A few years ago, the plate design changed in a national way, so the département's number didn't appeared in the car plate's number anymore
But French people got pissed, because we couldn't be racist toward each other anymore
So they added that small part on the right side of the plate for the département
This part is unnecessary and you can ask to get a car plate from a département that isn't the one you bought your car in (my father got a 29 (finistère) car plate while he lives in the 41 (loir et cher) and bought his car in the 45 (loiret))
People do that now to either show their heritage (My father's case
He is from the Finistère and loves his plate, my GF too have a 69 (Rhône) plate while we live and she bought her car in the 01 (ain) département)
Some do to fear off the wankers (you'll see quite a lot of relatively nice cars with a car plate from Corsica even though they're not corsican because they piggyback on the clichés of Corsicans being revengeful assholes)
I think that's fun to know
France used to have black letter with white background in front plate and yellow background in back plate but they changed it in 2009 :'(
The old format was geographical too, you had to change plate if you move to another region
Knowing the area where the other driver lived was causing endless road rage shit-talking
The new ones aren't geographical but the plate still feature the area on the side because people were attached to it
Some people also choose the 93 number because Seine-Saint-Denis is the new Corsica lol
Personally I never had problems with my 94 plate outside of IDF
>from the Morbihan (he could see the 53 in their plates)
Morbihan is 56, 53 is Mayenne
There are shitloads of Seine-Maritime plates because grey cards are cheapest in Normandie, so companies prefer the former for their vehicule fleet
Oh yeah, it can be useful to know where your fellow driver is from
How else would I be able to shit talk about their region when they cut the line
Even better
if you're one of the 617 inhabitants of Tupin-et-Semons, your postal code is 69420
Oh, I didn't knew that
I don't think I've ever saw a french plate without the province though
Is that common in Italy
Lol we had departments before Italy even existed, they're a big part of our identity and we use them on plates since they were invented
That's because you don't hear the other drivers
I am to blame myself, for I worked in a parking for a national event where I saw many over many parisian cars that I cussed for they were arrogant
I generally have a bad stereotype on cars with 75 on them but I don't know why people hate the banlieue like we were Parisians lol
We are at this weird spot where Parisians think we are the countryside and the countryside thinks we are Parisians
Is the province your from and the province your car was bought a big deal
Like, would a tusconian go like "ew, this car comes from Sicilia, I'm not even gonna poke it with a stick
Oh you talk about new plates my bad I thought you talked about the concept of showing the department number
It's Paris of course, just like it's London
But if we exclude those cities because they don't play in the same yard AT ALL, then it's probably Lyon or Toulouse
Resolving a problem without creating five more
Dunkin' Donuts
I feel like they're at almost every street corner in other countries but non-existent in France for some reason
At least a chance at the 2nd best team to winning the soccer league
Discipline
Yeah
We love to complain
" Pourquoi faire simple quand on peut faire compliqué"
"why make it simple while you can make it complicated"
France's way of life
For once France shall join you on this one
belgium does not like plastic money either iirc
Y'all have stronger immune systems than the rest of us, you'll be fine
As a vegetarian, I find German cuisine has quite decent meat-free options
Even in the 90s, I could easily find something to eat in Germany even in the middle of nowhere
Sure, this isn't the best country for people who love salad
But I love recipes with potatoes and cream so I don't mind
As an American living in France for a long time, it is pretty sweet
There were zero advantages to the US system (besides dental, so I guess *one*)
Because we're right to do with guys like macron and his predecessors since the death of Pompidou
Belwhat ? Is this a territoire d'outre-mer ?
I haven't had many problems paying with a CB in Belgium, and we live about 12 KMs from the border
[Don't forget Houston
I don't think complaining is ever right
Being helpful is ideal
Complaining is seeing a problem and doing nothing positive to help
Helping is seeing a problem and stepping up to take positive action
Les gilets jaunes were not helpful
And didn't the Dutch government restrict sales in border cities to Dutch citizens
My experience is that in Brussels, starting at 9pm, every ATM is emptied by thirsty customers
And i guess they have atm at the French border for French people
Either your kebabs are very expensive or your pizzas are really cheap
Here, a pizza is usually 2x as expensive as a kebab
I agree, I've always been careful with this
French people are obsessed with chicken stock too, and also lard in my region (it's not so common now but it was everywhere before and the elderly still use it for cooking), so I always tell vegetarians travelling to either country to ask for no chicken stock or lard in their dish
Fortunately every time I travelled people have been very nice and the food was great !
>Of course I'd not shout that he is a dick in front of his office, but who can do it in front of their president's office
We do
Little local tradition
People want to pay their double Irish Dutch sandwich in cash :)
Where do you work ? Oberthur, Gemalto ?
Can't argue with that
Hell yeah
And thank you for myth busting some fake clichés and stereotypes about Belarus
You guys deserve more spotlight beyond being just "Little Russia" in the eyes of the world
With a line when it's a capital letter in cursive
Other than that, no
As someone who learns Italian casually with Duolingo, I never realized the Italian alphabet had fewer letters ! Anyway, in French, the cursive 'z' is different
At least, from what I remember of my school years long ago
It's with a loop at the bottom like for 'g'.
I write it with a line in the middle only doing maths to not confuse with a 2
Middle names aren't really a thing
But additional first names are
Usually 2 or 3 first names are given at birth
Though due to a mistake at my birth, I only have one
For my part, my 3rd name "Natchite" is apparently from a famous native American
Being overly expressive (to look polite I guess
Like you bake them a pie and they'll be like "O.M.G. it's absolutely brilliant, this is the BEST pie I had in my life
", and you're like "wtf, it's just a pie dude". They do it so often for most things, sounds so fake to me, when an american person is giving me a compliment I'm just like "meh, whatever", I don't believe it to be genuine, sounds exaggerated most of the time
Beginning a conversation on the phone without saying hello and, more importantly, hanging up without saying goodbye
The hug
Way too much body contact, especially with someone I just met
Not an American habit, but an America habit
the fact that wherever you turn you'll see or hear the three letters "God" placated pretty much everywhere
on dollar bills, on official building, in the morning-pledge at school
Agreed, while I think mandatory tipping is ridiculous and a shitty system I always tipped the amount required when I was in the US for that exact reason
Here you have to put a coin to unlock it and you get it back when you lock it back
There are easy workaround but it’s enough to make the big majority of people bring it back
It looks like some people genuinely think that it's ok because you can see so many on the parking lot, I can't believe they all know they are being assholes
It does require a deposit, but many stores have a plastic coin with the name of the store on it so people could leave them anywhere
But I've never seen it
I've only seen stolen carts in weird places
I think he's referring to [this typical American style] and in summer, the sandals are here
Believe me
That's a really cool job
Haha that is still crazy common compared to over here where it predominantly done for religious reasons
It could be, but then again I had an American friend who did just that and other nationalities don't seem to do that as much as Americans on TV
Idk
They said "shooting", not "knifing".
gonna walk the whole parking lot, no matter if it rains or snows, but I'm gonna get my 50 cents back
No the price is without service basically, you have to add 20% to the bill for the waiter or it means the waiter will pretty much not be paid for waiting on you (they get a small salary from their employers but it’s far from enough to live without the tips)
Labour code in the US is pretty much non existent so unless you have a very rare skill that makes you difficult to replace your boss can do pretty much what they want with you
Marseille, France :
THe [**MUCEM**] (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations) was inaugurated in 2013, and was well-received by the population of the city
[At night]
[The view underneath the "canopy]
[The footbridge to the nearby Fort Saint-Jean]
Right next to it, you can see the [**Villa Méditerranée**] which boasted the biggest inhabitated overhang in the world at the time of its inauguration
It is sadly not used anymore for various reasons (it has high operating costs, no more than 300 people can be at the same time in the overhang for accessibility reasons, etc)
There is also the  [**CMA-CGM tower**] designed by Zaha Hadid; it is the headquarter of the French shipping company CMA-CGM
[Closer look on the curvature]
There is now a second tower near it, the "[**La Marseillaise**] tower, that isn't too bad either; I think I remember it winning an architectural prize or something
You either love it or hate it
I hate it
It's the [Musée des Confluences] in Lyon
This is really pretty, but how is it not terrible for the trees
They have no room for their roots to grow
Interesting thanks, that makes me feel better :)
Well put
Architecture should be a sign of the Zeitgeist of the era, it should show the historical context
The bright green cross is the least flashy element in that entire building
The urgent things to be integrated :
- Taxes
- Retirement
- Army
The rest is kind of bullshit, if those three are dealt with
* What do they look like
A headless version of the default princess
* Do they have an animal sidekick
A little rat follows her and carry her head in a wheelbarrow, he sings sometimes
* Magical powers
She's alive, somehow
France wouldn't have a princess, what an abhorrent idea
We'd have the lady from Delacroix's painting "La Liberté guidant le Peuple", dressed as Jeanne d'Arc / Joan of Arc
She would have a majestic rooster or better yet, a triumphant snail as sidekicks
She would be able to make food appear from thin air, to make her countrymen rally round her and to haunt English people's dreams
Ghost (because she heard voices) sheep (because she was a shepherdess) as a side-kick, no royal blood of any kind
Okay i'm hyped now
Maybe a mix then, because the character names and the architecture look pretty french
Not a word about Finland in 12 years of school
Sorry but never heard of it, and actually I’ve never heard about anything regarding Finland history
Well, Finland joining the EU is in there, but that's about it
Nope
We learned about our neighbors once, but that's it
I had to learn this by myself
In Geography, we talk about the "global dynamics" like exchanges, flows, production, organisation of a city/industrial region, or the difference between countries and inegalities in these countries
I know almost nothing about Bulgarian history so don’t take this as an offense but I think that French history is already so rich and complex that we just don’t have time to study the History of countries we have nothing in common with
We even don’t have time to know all of our own
Besides in France, the history and geography programs are not really well made
it’s kind of messy
wow ok that’s pretty badass, well done !
Yeah that's a shame
There are many people that don't look farther than their nose
The irony is that in history class, some weeks ago, we talked about the European Union
At one point, we talked about the difficilty of creating an "European Culture", because, for example, people from France don't feel close to Czechia
At this point I just wanted to say yeah sure that people won't feel like that if our programms are so shit
Obviously France and Czechia don't have much in common, but the governments just stay there and say "welp boys, that's it". Instead of being "Francocentric", the History and Geography class should open the students to the world
Yes we don't have much in common with Czechia, Poland or Croatia, but we can create this link
Even if historically there is almost nothing between us, we can still create a common feeling in Europe
Someone can feel close to a country without  ever going there
That's this feeling that is needed to be created
By teaching the students about the history of Europe in its entierety, not just focusing on France, or any home country, we can start to create a bond between countries
well, I (F18) know for example that for the study of WW2, we’ve barely heard about the Japan-China conflict, or we’ve never talked the Apartheid in South Africa, or the conflict between Pakistan and India
There are a lot of things that we don’t talk about that are really important in the world History
We’ve never even studied the Indochina War though it was one of our colonies !
who would have thought right ?
in my opinion, the programs suck so the class depends a lot on the professor and thank god I’ve always had good professors but it’s not always the case since in France you can’t fire a public servant
Not an expert but I always found the [Sainte Chapelle] interior incredible
For complementary nature/manmade stuff, the [Mont Saint Michel] never disappoints
[Les Espaces d’Abraxas] were featured in  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  and then there is a steel framework tower in our capital that was met with much animosity, but that is engineering, not architecture
Notre-Dame
For cathedrals, I'd go with Amiens as the most impressive, but there are a ton of gorgeous ones of course
For modern architecture, the Pont du Gard
Edit: Meant Millau Viaduct
The Viaduc de Millau blew me away too, didn't even think to mention it
Pretty underrated
I got myself mixed up, I meant the Millau Viaduct
the Pont du Gard is great too obviously, mixed them up because they're relatively close geographically
BAC officers, BAC is a department of police that are generally sent first on any situation
They are plain clothes officers and they are absolute dicks to basically everyone and especially if you are not white
Apparently it comes from the fact that officers who ask for this posting tend to be looking for action but no matter the reason these guys are often racist pricks who get off the power they get over people
I don’t think any police department is quite universally reviled as BAC, even the CRS (riot police) are not as hated as them and they are hated a lot too for their brutality
It’s always like that, the less power they have, the more they get off it
But August Diehl
Plain clothes mean they are dressed like civilians
They have an armband when they intervene but they are often used to arrest dealers and criminals in the act and so they keep a low profile until the last second to avoid spotters
The Academie Francaise is a group of people who sit and decide about new words and spelling for official documents of the French government
I often read in U.K. and US news about the Academie forcing French people to not use English words and preventing the French language from moving into the 21st century and trying to paint the French as stuck-up and arrogant people who hate English and anything that is not French
Nobody knows or cares about the Academie in France
Another example is when France banned free refills in fast-food restaurants
It was never the norm, it’s just not part of the culture
Again, I learned it on US news
Reddit went crazy
Lots of Americans got very emotional writing about how they will never visit France, how the government is oppressing it’s people, and how America is the last bastion of freedom shinning light over the world
Nobody gives a shit in France
It was bizarre to witness this overreaction for something as meaningless as a free refill that was never part of the culture to begin with
From people who go bankrupt from medical bills because of their backward system
We've got pretty much the same here, our far-right party is the second biggest but with the way our system works and the fact that a ton of people won't ever vote for them there's no realistic way they come to power
I remember the free refill shit, it was so fun reading about it on internet
The journalist should visit r/natureismetal more often
They had to change their country name to Eswatini to deflect that threat
Well, i buy a baguette almost everyday
Wine, baguette and cheese for dinner
and breakfast
and lunch
Ate cheese and baguette like everyday
Blowing 60€ on a cheese platter and then passing three different bakeries to go to the one I like so I had the best bread to go with it
Also when I moved in one of the first things I bought were three different sets of wine glasses for champagne, whites and reds
2 weeks ago, I had a *jambon-beurre* baguette sandwich with a glass of Bordeaux red wine at the counter of a *bistrot* in Paris
It felt like heaven
There, you have it
Both hudging others and being never late are checking out
I'm glad to read that, I would never imagine making a Danish stranger happy by buying baguettes ahah
Dual citizenship isn’t a problem in France and I’m glad that’s the case
It seems absurd to block it
Maybe the problem comes from the UK, as I don't think we've got any restrictions about having several nationalities
But your case sounds a bit odd as I know some people who have both the British and the French nationalities
I was quite young, so I got only fuzzy memories of it
In the 90's, as a teen, you had to be death and blind to not know what a condom was and how essential it was to avoid AIDS
AIDS was synonym with slow, miserable, inexorable death with no real cure for it
That is so sad
Thanks for explaining
Countries have different policies
I donate in Germany and there are many boxes you have to check
You are considered an at-risk person if you’ve had sex with more than 3 people in the past year
I like how Italian sounds more than Spanish
But Japanese and British English are my favorites
I like Italian and Russian
Even knowing that since a long time, as a French it's always surprising to see how many people love how French sounds
Italian wins that one for me
My favourite is Scots Gaelic, a shame it's a dying language
Funny, I hate how Spanish sounds (nothing against you hispanophones, that is just a preference)
To me, German with the right accent is the most beautiful, followed by Russian
Not à European language but Cantonese and Mandarin sound really beautiful
my favorite is french lol
French guy hating how French sounds here, but loving the accents, intonations, sonorities and phrasing of Nordic languages
As someone working with a lot of Americans it's not bad at all and sometimes  very cool or even funny to hear, especially the strongest (southern
) accents
Got a friend from Chicago and he has a cool accent as well
Americans, and anyone else, making fun of Britain
Only we can do that god damit
I think no country should be ridiculed if it isn't for something recent
Making fun of people for something they didn't live is just so dumb !
Also I'd like to say thank you to everybody who said that the "French surrender" joke isn't funny
Like some people say: we hate you all the same way <3
Nazi jokes about Germany
Switzerland: Don't touch to our french bros, but shitting on those bloody Bourbine is ok
Belgium: only french can make fun of them
Every other european countries except England: one or two little jokes is ok, but no insult or annoying jokes
England (not UK, just England): Don't care
Germany, partly because I spent part of my childhood there
Any type of "Club Med" thing
Belgium, as a French I love this country
The whole debt crap with Southern Europeans is incredibly irritating, and the Brexit thing has more than had its run
I'm also always quite defensive of Québec
Thank you, friend
Voltaire's quote about the HRE is quite the bon mot though
And I don't even like Voltaire
Re: the Bielefeld thing
why ? I've heard ot that joke, but I don't get it ?
Italy !
With exceptions for the Scottish, the Irish, and I guess the Welsh
Yeah but I do love my fucking baguettes though
Did you guys just tried to marry us this whole time ?
Not just nowadays
Not original though
*start to cry*
Matou, which is a cute way of saying my name “Mathieu” , the -ou suffix makes things cute in french, and also is a word for “tomcat”.
My mom (algerian) would call me « mehza l’kehla » which mean « black goat » (which is actually, believe it or not, a cute nickname lol) ! I think it’s the equivalent of saying someone is a « black sheep » but it’s actually positive, just means you’re unique
She’d also call me « mazouziya », which means « the cherished one ».
My first name is Frédéric
My father often nicknamed me as "Alfred".
Also my older brother is named Florent, so he was "F1" and I was "F2". Yeah, that caused some psychological issues up to this day
"ma puce" (my flea), "ma biche" (my doe) or "ma cocotte" (my hen)
I know it sounds weird in English but it's fairly common in French
My dad always called me "Ma (petite) puce". Means "my (little) flea", sounds weird but it's just a normal way to say "sweetie" in French
No nickname for me but my mother called my nephew "Crapaud" which means "Toad" in English
It's not a common nickname and it doesn't sound cute but my nephew really liked it
Mistinguett
That was the scene name of an actress and singer from the late 19th century/early 20th
My mother called me "Ma Puce" (My flea), and my brother "Mon bonhomme" (My good guy)
On cats, my siblings & I are “chaton” ou “chatoune” (little male cat, little female cat)
Plus a bunch of nonsensical individual nicknames
Yes, the good thing about biblical names is that they are translated in many languages
Hahaha ! Ok, just googled it, seems terrifying
I wanted to learn Greek but I didn't find a lot of websites/apps, as I know that Duolingo isn't great :( I found Drops but that's all
Back when I was in uni (late 2000s) there was a new, modern app/website backed/endorsed by some fairly famous comedian
I can't recall the name of their the fella or the app but it was all the rage in those pre-Duolingo days
Does that ring any bell at all
Thank you !
I watched it ! It's very useful for pronounciation
It's illegal to become a state worker if you have a criminal record, but you can become a politician and get elected even if you have one
That's bullshit
Commercials aimed at little children
No company should have the right to manipulate a child's mind
Also "convenience euthanasia" of pets
If it's done for convenience, it's not euthanasia, it's an act of cruelty
A lot of things
SUV cars (and ultimately all non-electric vehicles), non-bio food, non re-usable plastic, a shit lot of pesticides, non free-range animals (how is it still legal to sell meat from animals who have tortured their whole life
), investments in fossil fuels, coal, industrial fishing, ...
Lobbying, circumsition without medical reason, use of violence made by police during protestation, ritual slaughter of animals (because they're alive and conscious) are the main things I'm thinking about
Not voting, not recycling
Farmed fish eat pellets made of wild fish
As long as farmed fish won't eat fish-free pellets, it isn't much better than wild fish
In my country, crime is synonymous with felony and doesn't include infraction and misdemeanor
There must be several languages making the difference, so maybe it was meant this way
It's been illegal in France for a while at least
In Brittany, France, we have the Ankou, an old myth about a skeleton wearing local outfits but in black, he has a scythe, an old undead horse with a chariot and he comes for the dead people
We have also la Dame Blanche ( the White Lady ) wich appears to you when you are probably going to die to warn you
It’s a modern myth iirc as a group of friends were in a car driving by night and suddenly a ghost young lady appeared on one seat in the back, screaming something like « careful
» and then disappeared
And she mades the driver avoiding something on the road
My grandfather comes from South-west France and was told the legend of the "raw leg" (jambe crue) which is basically a single leg with an eye and a mouth wandering in the forest at night eating lost children
Ridiculous monster but it still traumatizes generations and generations haha
Le voirloup, a satanical werewolf that can take the appearance of a rooster, boar, dog, cat
The satanical stuff is a bit creepy
Maybe be it’s a really dumb thought but could your Draugen be the inspiration of Skyrim’s Draugr ?
That’s very likely, I remember I was a kid when my dad told me about that story on a specific road near our home so I thought it was local folklore as I saw that story too on some festivals but indeed it could be just a local version of an old myth shared by Europeans cultures
Nice to know, thank you
That's an adorable image
Why the ear thing, though
Try Broadchurch next
I honestly don't know why they aren't more popular even in the South of France
I feel like I only see them outside of Europe
Me too
Tennant is awesome, he feels as natural as an eccentric alien as he does a washed up depressive detective
Well then if you haven't already, try **The Angel's Share** by Ken Loach
Exactly the same in every western European country, where I've been to parties (France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, etc
You usually bring something to drink with you as a gift for the host, who then proceeds to put everything that was brought in a single place where everyone just gets whatever they want
Have you watched River
It’s a very nice crime series from UK and I am surprised it is not more well known because it’s great
Yeah
Luther also is awesome
For *l'* it's obvious since it's for any word starting with a vowel
Still doesn't indicate if it's feminine or masculine
For *le/la*, [there are rules] depending on how the word ends, but also a lot of exceptions
So you can usually guess it right (more by feeling actually, I never learned these rules
), but there are always some words you have to look up because they don't fit the rules
There are a few words where the meaning changes if you change the article/gender (*le tour* = turn, *la tour* = tower)
Also, a few words that can be either, you can say both *un après-midi* (an afternoon) or *une après-midi*.
We know the gender of words, but only because we made repeated mistakes as kids and got corrected on the spot
Most of time I'd say yes, as there rules that can be applied to find a words article
That being said , some words are just weird, and people use the wrong article even with super common words they've been using for ever
Also, a few words which change gender when they’re plural (“un bel orgue” but “de belles orgues”)
Fun fact
Vagina is masculine in French
Dick is feminine
_But_ pussy is feminine
And penis is masculine
This show is even worse than I thought
“Vagin” comes from the Latin name for sheath
Nouns’ genre are usually not determined by their meaning, but by their etymology
And the man who claims to possess a woman’s vagina is about to become single
Well if you want to unite, you all have a common enemy, Nutella is masculine in French
We have them in "interesting" places: on the side of hikes, close to a good view, etc
I don't think that's a thing in France but there's usually always somewhere to park your car
We only have car parks in places of interest
For everything else, it is accepted to just park your car on the side of the road
Yes we have a franco-german channel named Arte that broadcasts about 50% of german productions (movies and shows)
The brits also send us doctor who each year
I do not watch a lot of TV but I guess we have a bit of others countries too
Well we have Arte which is a channel mixed between good French documentaries and boring German films uwu
From a French who watches a lot of afternoon cheesy TV-movies, the most we have are American ones (especially Hallmark movies from early November to February), but yeah I think German is second
I love Arte
It's probably the best channel we have
Eeeh wieso habt ihr die guten Filmen und wir haben die Deutschen
Yeah cobra 11 has also been on french TV for a very long time, I use to watch it coming back from school every day
Naja denn ich würde gerne besser echt nach Deutschland fahren für ein Austausch
That we are surrendering cowards
Man I can't stand this one, it's more of a free pass to insult us than a stereotype or a joke
I don't care about the rest of them, like yeah we love our baguette even though we don't necessarily wear striped sweater, that's harmless though
Can i nominate the same for both
Cuz that's "cheese-eating surrender monkeys" to me
Not the cheese part, of course we like cheese, maybe you would too if you knew how to make good one ;)
But international ribbing apart, the rest really gets to me
Both angers and frightens me how quickly it caught up, really hammers home how scarily efficient the USian propaganda machine can be when it comes to justifying war (and look how appropriate it is again
Every other decade like clockwork)
And on the other hand, I'm amused because, well, us Frenchies becoming internationally reviled for
refusing to go to war
For declining to invade a middle eastern country for made-up reasons
For opposing war hawks
Holy fucking shit, I don't think anyone would have seen this one coming
So there's a fair bit of irony there as well
The surrender thing is unbearable
We have one of the best army in Europe, if not the best, it makes no sense regarding our history and our current presence in several battlefields
All the other things are fine, we are rude, Paris is dirty and we are pessimistic
That France is full of gay people
Obviously said by offended homophobes who only visited some parisian areas which are well known as gay districts
There's a strong gay subculture here but it doesn't mean that France is LGBT heaven
French LGBT people are victims of daily discrimination and crime just like in the rest of Europe and I wish some people realized this
And also that French women are hairy
Not at all a true stereotype as most French women shave, but this is hilarious
France:
Hate: the "all cowards" and "always surrender"one
Members of my family like many are still suffering of the lost of a love one or the consequences of the war
(My grand mother is still afraid of the sound of boots in the street for exemple and still can't talk about her brother, a resistant who was shot at the age of 17
The white flags memes and others are above EVERY video or article about france
it's start to be anoying now
Funny one: all women are slim, well dressed and elegant
Clearly those who said that never saw me, especially me on a sunday morning
(please feel free to correct my english
I'm working on it ;)  )
I gave it a chance as a young innocent boy starting secondary school, which means I enrolled for German classes for 9 years
And yeah it was hard (having a terrible teacher to start with didn't help) but like you said, it can be easier for someone who knows a germanic language, or speaks one as a native
Personally I could never figure out how to chose between ein, einer, einen, das, die, der etc
probably because it is one of the first thing we're supposed to learn and the teacher's method was "here, learn this dialog by heart and repeat it".
I guess it's as hard for us to learn German as it is hard for you to learn French, or any latin language maybe
I stand with you on the "German is an ugly language" front
It's mostly because most people are first exposed to it through old recordings of an angry Austrian who we tend to think more or less as the Devil Incarnate I think
I find German beautiful for its elaborate but extremely pleasing (to me) grammar, as opposed to English's brutish (again, to me) simplicity
Here we have an expression you  could categorize as a stereotype
"Être saoul comme un Polonais" (Being as drunk as a Polish)
That one might come mainly from us
To be honest, I've never been to the UK nor tasted any of your food (that I know of) and I still feel there's some truth to that stereotype
I'm not saying it's true, i'm saying i've been seing and I've heard all my life that it's the case, so it became somewhat true to me, even without any evidence
So I'm sorry, someday I'll visit the UK and hopefully be cleansed of that cliché.
I mean any stereotype that's just an excuse for an insult is detestable, just like this one
I just don't see the point behind it, it isn't funny, doesn't sound smart and in most case it's not even a product of hatred so it's hard to see a reason behind it appart from "remember that one time you lost LOL loser".
How many is too many
what about not enough
\^\^
The only stereotype here is the striped shirt though :p baguettes and wine aren't,  we do love them and consume them in large quantities, that's a fact
As for the rest, you're preaching the choir ahah
Yeah it mostly comes from them
The way lots of them see things is that America saved the day during 2 world wars when reality is very different
TBF, the "always on strike" stereotype is true
I take the bus for work and you can be sure bus drivers will be on strike monthly for several days or longer
It's very annoying
Yeah that's the "source" of the stereotype, but shit like that happened at least once to any country, kingdom or empire in its history, yet the "jokes" are for us
Yes I hate that one and I don't understand where it came from because cheating isn't acceptable here
Marinières (striped shirts) are much more popular in France than elsewhere though
They're not ubiquitous, certainly, but there is a basis for it as well
France didn't send 11 thousand Frenchmen to serve in the SS
They were volunteers, big difference
This is directly tied with the interwar French political landscape and our surrender
France did collaborate but it didn't fight for the Axis
That's like staying Sweden was an Axis power
Hey, maybe german needs more roundabouts to sound pretty :p just kidding
For the number I see your point, even though for us it just sounds normal
For instance quatre-vingt, when you're learning our language you see as 4 20, but for us it's just a word for 80, we don't think 4 20 we just say it, and think it like a single word katrevin lol I don't have enough knowledge as to why it has come to this, I just know that it's based on 20 rather than 10
As for your level of French, I am in the same exact situation with German, which is a shame
All these years going to class after class of it to come out unable to speak it, what a waste of time
I wish I was actually able to speak German as good as I do English
Same thing for me with german, I had terrible grades, the teachers didn't really care much nor question herself about it so I thought "fuck it" too and stopped even trying
Then in high school I had a better teacher, and managed to have better grades around 10/20 (below ten is bad, 10 itself is "la moyenne" the middle ground, it's ok, not great)
I honestly have no clue ^^
Oh I believe you, like I said the only reason I "believe" in that sterotype is that it's been repeated endlessly to me for my whole life
There shit food and great food in any country in the world
I mean, if your answer to "UK food is shit" is "But you can get Indian food there !", maybe that's not much of a counterpoint
I think only WWII, since we didn't lose or surrender nor didn't get invaded during WWI even if most of the fights took place on French soil
And yeah the comparison is accurate, yet we're the only ones widely mocked about a loss that way
It comes a lot from the US but if we were to make a joke of the same level, they would lose their shit
Just imagine the shitstorm it would create if we were to spread jokes about them based on 9/11 or something like that
There's always a basis for a stereotype, it just becomes exagerated like it is the case of marinières, but you're probably right that it's more popular here
I mean it had its glory hour some decades ago that must have given birth to the sterotype, and we can still see someone wearing one once in a while
True, but a stereotype is usually exagerated
There's no exageration when it comes to baguettes and wine \^\^
Why are you doing this to us
You know what they say, history is written by the victors
Yeah, it's a joke, about  one of the worst things that happened to France and Europe, repeated over and over and over and over again everytime French are even brought up
But sure, we wont take it seriously
When I see the surrender jokes I always wonder how they would react if we made jokes about Americans soldiers being baby killers who lost to a bunch of rice farmers
Probably badly, but of course it's not the same thing when it's against them
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I mean I wouldn't like me being cheated on, I wouldn't like if a friend told me he cheated on his partner
But the President ? I couldn't care less, it's his private life
That's the stupidest thing I have ever read, and I read a lot
What did with English for me (because I wasn't that good at it in school) was series and music
Sadly i'm quite deaf now so there goes that
That's nice \^\^ now all we need is good teaching techniques ahah
Hey at least, learning German I got to come to your country for a schooltrip when I was a kid
Got drunk for the first time of my life in Wolfenbüttel on Jägermeister :D
Yeah that amplified it and made the insult kind of mainstream
Joke is on them, they have a president that collects every stereotypes we have about the US :)
Oh man you should try raclette ;) it's a type of cheese usually cut in slices, we melt the slices one by one in small pans with a special grill thing especially for it, and poor the molten cheese on charcuterie, potatoes, eggs etc
It's a winter thing, one of those you keep on eating until you're on the verge of death :)
Maybe you just don't notice them cause you don't care about them which is good
But these jokes are there everytime anyone speaks about anything french on internet
Its on reddit, in YouTube comments, on twitter, facebook
you can't seriously say anything about France without some idiot thinking he's a smartass coming up with this joke
I'm pretty good at ignoring that kind of shit, but this one comes up so often than it just makes me angry, it's my country, my culture and my history that's being shat on everytime I see that joke
You mean because the USA was in a proxy war against the communists, right ? We never asked their help, it was an independance war and I'm pretty happy we stopped it
Not our fault if they were in a cold war with Russia and China
Sure let's punish a whole country because of the actions of corrupt politicians and traitors while De Gaulle and the free armed forces of France and the resistance kept fighting to liberate the country
truth is De Gaulle fought to restore a French government, and played the allies leaders just right to ensure there would be no obstacle to that goal
Anyway, that's not the subject at hand and that's where I stop feeding the troll
Never been to strasbourg, but definitely will go within the year  ^^ spanish is a nice language, although I don't like it spoken by spanish people, sounds agressive and loud to me, but my girlfriend is Mexican and sounds wonderful ahah
I'm not in school anymore, so german is a long gone memory to me
Point is that contrary to the USA, we weren't only fighting in Vietnam, but in Indochina (Vietnam + Cambodge + Laos)  so our battlefield was 3X bigger
Our Army and our population were ridiculous compared to the military strenght of the USA
We don't joke about the "cowardise" of the USA
They do
Because it's so funny to joke about the dead soldiers of their allies
&#x200B;
At first, it was a classic independance war between France and Indochina ( 1946 et 1949)
The French gouvernment wanting to let it go (the war was very impopular in France), but it then became a proxy war in 1950 between the USA and the communists after the begining of the Korea war (1950) and the etablisment of the Communist China (1949)
The USA gave us a lot of weapon and asked us to fight against the communists
The war became way more brutal, with a lot of casualities
&#x200B;
At the end, the french government said "fuck you with your proxy war, if you want to fight, you have to go to the battlefield
We wasted to much time for this shit"
No worries,  I liked reading you get carried away ahah and I agree, it is a beautiful symbol of the beautiful thing that has been done to fix our countries relation, I'd say it's miracle
To think of the shit we put each others through and now we're like best buds, that's crazy and a real treasure
I've talked with chinese and Korean people, and theres still hate towards the Japanese for shit that happened during wars, even among young people, this would be unthinkable nowadays between us, or even between France and England
As for my girlfriend, I haven't faced the mexican wrath yet, good communication, but honestly I kind of want to see it someday ahah
No problem, every opportunity to learn is to be taken ^^ Not great in 20th century myself, especially WWII, I mean I know enough, but I kind of feel harassed by it : too many documentaries about it, it's omnipresent in our lives since we're kids
I get it is important to make sure we won't repeat the past, but at some point you know "yeah yeah, I get it".
As for Japan, that's a good analysis, but I don't know what their logic is
When I look at it, I see a country trying to blind itself of the crimes of the past, but maybe not for bad reason
They vowed not to ever go to war again, and seems maybe they just want to be the post war Japan and erase a shameful past
I don't know, again not enough knowledge of these times
0-15°: winter jacket
15-20°: sweater and a light, mid-season jacket on top
20-25°: t-shirt and a light jacket, because a cool breeze can still happen
25°+: t-shirt and a light jacket or hoodie nearby (but not on my shoulders) just in case of wind/harsh sun
That works well for a French southerner
I would say 24 degres, under I would only be confortable in the sun but if I'm in a shadow  place with a bit of wind I would be a bit cold without moving
It depends on the wind strength really
Overall I'm really resistant to the cold
I hate to be warm and I wear only a t-shirt or a shirt as soon as I can
Anything above 5° (sometimes even lower on mornings when I know it will be acceptable during the day), I'll only wear a t-shirt, because I can't bother carrying a sweater or a jacket all day
Most of the time I'll forget it anyway
I have a sweater I brought at work about 3 weeks ago, still there on my desk chair because I systematically leave it there at the end of the day
Also, I live in the Alps and haven't worn a winter coat in like 3 or 4 years, even with deep freezing temperatures
A hoodie with a scarf is generally as dressed as I'll go
add a good 5° and you get the scale for france
edit: south france to me at least
I'd say after the attacks in 2015 it feels different, mostly because there are a lot more military/police in the streets
We had the 2015 attentat, so there is a ultra-security atmosphere, in the law and in protocols
We also learned that a "great democracy" could be ruled by one political party, and that government could mutilate protesters, and even kill 2 of them, without any consequences
But at least we won the world cup
Crimea against cheese, ok putin ?
Tbh apart from seeing some soldiers in airports or train stations not much has changed for me, although we must be careful of potential laws that reduce freedom for the sake of safety
More security everywhere, but except that not that much today
There is all the hidden side of security, like massive surveillance of internet, laws about searching the houses, ect
I would not include extremism rise as a cause of the attacks
It is really a global phenomenon which started before 2015 in France
France got the euro in 2002 and the price in francs are still written on the notes ahah
If ever you need someone to make a government, we can always give you François Hollande
[He's super cute] and he doesn't bite, not too high mileage, a real bargain
It's a an alert system that can be activated at several levels
Currently in France, it
1) allows soliders to patrol in the street (it is called the Opération Sentinelle - the soldiers are complaining about it because of the job isn't what they signed for and mainly because it is highly tiring and stressful as they have to always to walk in full equipment, to look after each civilian considering them as a possible terrorist, not knowing what they legally can do as they are not policemen AND being the first target of terrorists and crazy people)
2) raise the security and controls when you are in public places
For instance, schools now have as many training against terrorist attacks (flee or hide) as against burning
Since 2015, I, as a student, have had one or two every year
Here is an article dealing with the fact that Opération Sentinelle soldiers are a target :
There is the same thing in France
Since 1996, 30-40% of the music displayed has to be French
There are exceptions with cultural radio station who can avoid them and for instance Nostalgie, a radio playing historic famous music, which has a 60% quote
Perfect nickname, I'll keep it too ha ha !
For the bad condition of work, I am unable to find a great article regarding this but the unfortunately frequent suicides in the army trigger debates regarding this
For the difference between police and the army a relevent example is the 13th of november of 2015 attacks
The Plan Vigipirate was at his maximum level following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in january (against the satire magazine)
Therefore the Opération Sentinelles were patrolling this night
They arrived quickly at the Bataclan
Nevertheless they did not intervene as the Préfecture de Police (the Police higher instance) refused
They were not trained to and it was not "a war zone". La BAC (Brigade anti-criminalité, urban police) was already on the scene and were trained to this type of intervention
The soliders had order to shoot only if the terrorists came out down the street as it would be légitime défense (Right of self-defense or here protecting the people)
However the 8 soldiers declined to hand them their FAMAS (former French war weapon - sadly given up for a sh*tty german gun but it's not the debate) because they were not allowed to
The BAC couldn't intervene without them as the terrorists had Kalashnikov
It ended up being the BRI and the RAID (two of the several units that could be compared to the American SWAT) who went in
NB : I am not trying to prove anything with "what if" I am just saying soldiers are not policemen
For my fellow French speaker, an article on the event
13 novembre 2015 : pourquoi les militaires de « Sentinelle » ne sont pas intervenus au Bataclan
We have:
\-Vercingétorix: Celtic gaul leader who fought against Julius ceasar
\-Charles Martel: who kicked the omeyad infidels out of France
\-Charlemagne: Unified a large part of Europe
\-Joan of Arc: French maid who bitch-slapped the brits out of France
(Before getting deep-fried on a stick
\-Napoléon: Bitch-slapped all european monarchies before getting punched in the face by Russia winter
\-George Clémenceau: Badass french politician and he did a lot to win WWI
He was called "The tiger" because of his ferocity
\-Jean Moulin: The most well-known French resistant during Nazi occupation of France
\-Charles de Gaulles: Like Clémenceau but during WWII
\-Arnaud Beltrame: Policeman who died in 2018 during a terrorist attack after he saved all the hostages (he was not in uniform and had no weapons on him)
This guy is a fucking hero
EDIT: Added Charles Martel and Charlemagne
In 2005, there was a TV show in France that ranked the "greatest" Frenchmen of all time
It's a highly subjective topic and it suffers from recency bias but I think it's a pretty accurate list overall
The top 5 are :
**Charles de Gaulle
** Leader of the French resistance movement during World War II and President of France between 1958 and 1969
Admired for leading the French resistance, and giving post-war France international prestige and independence in their foreign policy
**Louis Pasteur
** Chemist who discovered vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization
Developed vaccines against rabies and anthrax
**Abbé Pierre
** Priest who was a member of the Resistance movement during World War II
Founder of the Emmaus movement, which helps poor and homeless people
**Marie Curie
** Physicist and chemist
Co-discoverer of radioactivity, radium and polonium
First woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics (1903) and Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911) and the only person to have won both
**Coluche
** Comedian, actor and humanitarian activist
Founder of the Restaurants du Coeur, a non-profit charity movement who distribute food to the needy and help people out with finding housing
[Here] is the rest of the list
Jean Bart
Every year, on multiple occasions, we all knee together holding our arms and sing his glory
Where I came from, we only knee for him, none else
(French) We have several but I’d say one of them is Jean Moulin
First leader of the resistance against Germans during WW2, he was captured and horridly tortured to death and still didn’t say a thing
Charles Martel and Charlemagne can be added too
In my city the hero we have above all of them is Jean Bart
Voltaire, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, Emile Zola, Baudelaire, Rimbaud
Why do we keep forgetting our artits, poets, philosophs, writers
? :(
What about Lech Wałęsa ?
What about Kaiserin Sissi
Would you count her as a Bavarian
He is still a potato in a bed or did he get better ?
True
I've edited my post
The whole sea thing was always a problem for us
Can they be considered like hero
Then we should also include our great scientists:
Laplace, Lamarck, Sadi Carnot, Pasteur, Pierre et Marie Curie, Lagrange, Cuvier, Lavoisier, Ampère, Navier, Broca, Becquerel, Coriolis, Cauchy, Levy, Mandelbrot
She was born in Poland but later became a French citizen
Yep, you're right !
Personally, I believe this people (and some other people we havent mentioned yet like Molière and Mozart) to be heroes
Because in the end, art and culture prevails
didn't knew that
I went to Gdansk once and they were selling lot of goodies in tourist shop about him and the solidarnosk, I though he was some kind of well loved working class hero
He has a statue and place named after him in Nice, France
N'empêche, le héro le plus glorifié de France ça reste Jean Bart
À Dunkerque ça fait quand même genre 170 ans que tout les ans, sans exception, on se met à genoux devant sa statue pendant le carnaval et on chante la "Cantate à Jean-Bart", qu'on connait tous par coeur
Chaque Carnaval se fini par ce chant à la gloire de Jean Bart, et vu que ça dure tout les samedis soirs et les dimanches pendant 2 mois, ben ça fait beaucoup de fois où on se met à genoux et on chante à la mémoire de Jean Bart
En plus à Dunkerque, le surnom de la ville c'est "la cité de Jean Bart", les dunkerquois c'est "les enfants de Jean Bart"... y a pas beaucoup de héros qui ont une bande de gens bourrés et déguisés qui chantent sa mémoire 2 mois par an, systématiquement depuis plus de 150 ans
Tbh both of my great grandparents that were alive during WW2 don't want to talk about this period
Beside that I guess I had a grandfather who participated during may 68
My grandfather was a priest, a missionary priest sent to Africa to convert people to Christianity
As far as I know, he went to Morroco, Senegal and Cameroon
I've found a visa to Cameroon and a vaccination paper from Casablanca
He was then part of the whole French colonization machine, at the end of it
He was then fired of the order, married my grandmother and became a writer at Gallimard
During the 2nd war he didn't fight, he went south with the rest of his school who made priests
He died in 2000
I also found prisoner camp tickets from my other grandfather (that I never knew, died in 87), from a German camp
I keep them in my wallet
So, Great-grand-father died in Germany in 1941 and was in a cavalery regiment before that (part of those captured in Dunkirk)
I had a grand-father that was sent in Algeria, he spent time as a "Ambulancier" (don't know  the exact word in English sorry), he never wanted to spoke about it, so I don't have much more info sadly
Otherwise I don't have much informations about my ancestors
My grandfather was in the war of Algerie
That's it
Had a great uncle who disappeared in Verdun, he was listed as MIA and never was heard of again
We assume his body is still there under a field somewhere
My grandfather was an artillery NCO during the debacle in Belgium, they were waiting for an allied unit they were supposed to support and a panzerdivision showed up on their rear instead
They got captured without any realm chance to fight and he spent the rest of the war in a pow camp
One of my uncles was infantry in a colonial unit and was not in mainland France when France surrendered
I know his unit was with Free French forces but he was a humble person and always pretended like nothing much happened and it would have been indelicate to of me to press him
The only thing he would talk about was the drill
The Franco-Prussian or world wars aren't particularly interesting since *everyone* fought in them
The guy with the most interesting life is my great great uncle (my great grandfather's younger brother) who was a Catholic missionary in China from the 1920s to the late 40s or so
He saw the Warlords Era, the Japanese invasion, civil war etc
Eventually the diseases he got there (mostly malaria as I recall) forced him to come back to France and he became a parish priest around the ancestral village
He baptized and married pretty much everyone in the family until he died in the 70s.
I have ancestors who fought in WW1, on the western front
Sadly, I don't know much about that
Yeah that was not .I lived with my grandfather for almost 4years and when he was talking about it (it was rare) you could see that he has been "marked" by the war and that he was very upset about it, it was a very sensitive subject
Twice, under the Carolingians starting from Charlemagne and under Napoléon
Good food made with quality ingredients ; can be found in the US but is certainly not as commonplace as in most of Europe
Gun restriction laws
They
They do that
That's honestly horrible, I didn't know
The American sense of superiority is veeeery real on reddit
Also, it often translates as an anti-european feeling, especially in subs like r/askanamerican
Not a fan of olives as good but will admit the lack of olive oil is a real calamity
The Japanese didn't really like a Frenchman in charge of one of their national treasuries
In French we use a lot of them like «pressing »(dry cleaners ) « leggings »( tracksuit bottoms
Idk if its the correct translation) « jogging »(to go for a run )
« Brushing »( to get a hair blow dry)
« Happening »(an appearance on Tv)
And so on
It’s very confusing sometimes
All of these are also used in french with the exact same meanings
You guys can go to public protests and get out of it alive ? ;p
# /s
just in case
French too, with a whole lot of other nonsensical shit thrown in
Tear gas isn't exactly nice either
Let me try to do it with French word (some of them don't have translation though), between quote is the translation:
A la "fin de la semaine"(weekend), je cours au "place de stationnement"* (parking) près du tramway puis on va au bowling
Mais après des vacances au camping mes cheveux ont besoin d'un shampooing, où même un "relooking"** (makeover)
Si je ne peux pas le trouver, j'utilise mon talkie-walkie ou je t'envoie un "courriel/ courrier électronique" (email)
*This is a bit stretching because parking mean a place with a lot of "place de stationnement" (meaning one place where you can park)
**This something we call an "Anglicism" taking an English word and modifying it/using it in an other way than intended on English, shampoing is another one
If you want to order just plain tap water in a French restaurant or bar, specify "a pichet" (EDIT: or "a carafe d'eau") (*a jug*)
Otherwise the waiter will assume you're ordering bottled water, and you'll have to pay for it
Home salesmen, telephone salesmen
Most of  locksmiths plumbers and craftsmen that are on the first page of google (need to find real guys on specialised websites), gypsies who make you sign "petitions" for cash in Paris
People who ask you for anything (time, phone, money) on the street are necessarily ill-intentioned
At Charles de Gaulle airport, there is a guy who has been having fun for years making tourists believe that he is 20 to 60€ short of a plane ticket to go home and overly generous tourists fall for it
He manages to earn tens of thousands of euros a month and the police can do nothing despite all the attempts because lying is not illegal according to the (lax) judges
Never EVER give your money to the two olds gipsy ladies in Annecy
I used to
Then one day i Saw them with the last brand new iphone
I'm a bit curious, where are you from
For me in France you don't really ask for water in restaurants, you usually get water even if you don't ask for it
I was actually surprised when going abroad (in Italy for example) where I got a bottle when I said "I'm good with water" as I would say in France when I don't want any special drink
Though I can imagine it being a tourist trap that we common French people are immune to
What ? I just ask water, and they never bring me bottles
Where do you live ?
We have the same, especially around train stations
If you sign they will pressure you into donating, and if you get your wallet out, they will either steal it or just take whatever they want in there
And spoiler alert: they're not really deaf
I think a lot of people would just give them money to avoid further confrontation, whether they know they're being scammed or just confused
You can say "carafe" instead, if it's easier
The t in pichet is silent, it's pronounced pichè basically if that helps
Une bouteille will be interpreted as wanting bottled water, which won't be free
* Everything is focused on the marks
* Foreign language courses are a disaster
* There is a big problem with learning mathematics
When i was in school the thing that was blatantly abusive was how they were insisting on the impossibility for us to find a job if we didn't have high school end exam and how little our prospect were if not doing the choice to go to an university
Nothing was said in most of our scholar curriculum about professional school or tech school
For most parent those school were deemed as the school for the retards, the kids who can't do anything and that's it
I learned more English on Internet than at school
Many interesting subjects (History, Philosophy, French) are taught in a boring way
The way we teach English and the way we discourage students to participate or express their own point of view (I don’t know how to get the fancy little flag, but I’m french)
" • Everything is focys on the marks
This is absolutely true
In France, it doesn't matter if you have learned something or not at school, the only important thing is to have good marks, nothing else matters
The difference with school systems from neighboring countries is striking (especially with Germany)
That's why you can see that usually, french students are less open-minded and have a bad self esteem compared to their neighbors
On the part on English, it's a common critic in France but to be honest the school teaches all the boring things you wouldn't learn by yourself so easy : irregular verbs, basic tenses, introduction to culture
Maybe you learnt a lot on the Internet but without those basis I bet it wouldn't have been so easy for you
Had countless panic attacks because of that
That's so true, the first day of a summer camp in USA the director ask me to stay with him every time he will had to speak to someone because he wasn't speaking a word of English
I was 15 and him 40
The current level in general is not good and I see this in engineering school
I think that English cuisine in general is judged too severely (and I am French
It might not be the most delicate cuisine in the world but it doesn't taste nearly as bad as one would be lead to believe
The traditional dishes are nice in a homey if slightly unrefined way
German bread was very good
I tasted different types of bread and they were delicious
I'm only now realising that my comment sounds a bit like a backhanded compliment
Oh well, a compliment is a compliment, backhanded or not
Some regions in Italy do eat frogs ? Interesting
Lettuce can be parboiled then fried in a pan with olive oil, garlic
A common plate found around the Mediterranean sea that allows you to eat almost any edible leaves, such as dandelion or bitter lettuce
There isn’t really
Nowadays the fleur de lys flags is associated with monarchists but they are not really seen as hate symbols even if a lot of monarchist groups are quite close to far right so you won’t necessarily be seen as a Nazi for flying one at your balcony, you will most likely be seen as a weird guy that is very conservative and probably very catholic
There isn't really one that is not appreciated except the Vichy regime flag
Maybe there are more but can't think of right now
I like it better tbh (the monarchist flag)
looks like a bad rip-off of Mexico
It's a really cool design
As I said while it's used by some far right organizations it's not considered an hate symbol
[Napoleonic bee is also very cool]
There isn’t really, they kept the same flag
Petain had a personal flag with a double sided axe but I think a lot of French have only seen it once in history books at school and would not really know what it is today
Those who would know of it would definitely think that you are Nazi dick for flying it though
I didn’t include it initially because it never was an official symbol of France and a lot of people don’t really know of it
Our navy's flag was entirely white, not the country's flag
Probably not, for a nationalist like Le Pen, Pétain is nothing more than a traitor
(actually he is considered a traitor by most people, not without good reasons)
>a rumor that someone got AIDS this way scared us off
I think it involved an other kind of fist shenanigan
We had this game involving digital stopwatchs, two people face each other with a watch in their hands and try to stop the watch at a round number (1''00 for instance), if you manage to do that you can slap your opponent
And repeat until one gives up
-Could you say something in French ?
-Quelque chose en français
-Woah, that's beautiful ! What does it mean ?
-Something in french
Comment est votre blanquette ?
I usually go with:
"Ok, super, mais qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?"
*"Ok, great, but what do you want me to tell you ?"*
So what's the grudge with FYROM precisely ?
Okay we can't do that but you can get Corsica back (corsican included)
If only Belgium existed when fries were invented
Hahaha, it is tho
[The university of Liège admitted the french were indeed french in 2019
It's ok, you invented the double-fried french fries tho
Your method is way better
We try
But they never seem to remember
We give your fries 2 stars bruvz
[Une recherche de l'université de Liège de 2019 a conclu que les frites sont bien d'origine française
] Ironique, hein ?
Et donc je mérite un bas vote pour avoir répondu à une blague
Tu n’as peut être pas très bien dormi toi hier soir
J'ai pas basvoté. Je suis mois meme à -1
Quelqu’un d’autre a très très très mal dormi hier soir alors
La Bonne Paye : At the beginning of the game you get your money for the month (salary), and the goal is to still have money at the end of the "month" (once you have gone through all 30 cases of the board, each representing a day: going shopping, rents, stuff like that)
Then there's also Les Loups-Garoux de Thiercelieux
It's a card game so I'm not sure that it counts, but it's a popular game
Each player gets assigned a card with who they are in the village (Werewolf, Witch, Regular villager, etc)
During the night, werewolves will kill villagers, and during the day, the villagers select someone they believe to be a werewolf to kill
The main goal of the game is to lie and try to stay alive by not revealing your role (werewolves will kill you if you are someone important like the Witch, who can bring someone back to life once and kill someone once, and the village will obviously kill you if you are a werewolf), while also killing the players on the opposite side
The game is a bit more complex than that, but those are the basics
It's a really, really fun game and my favorite one
"La Bonne Paye", I live in france
we have "Le Milles Bornes"
In France we have Tarot and Belotte, two card games that have similarities with Bridge
The first one can be played from 3 to 5 players (but the tournament rules are for 4 players), and uses a deck of 78 cards
The second one is only for 4 players and is played with a deck of 32 cards
In Tarot depending on your cards you can decide to play against all the other players, which is difficult but brings you lots of points if you succeed (the winner being the one with the more points after several games)
In Belotte you play one team of 2 against one other team of 2
In France we have the same, called "jeu de l'oie" (lit
"game of the goose", but sounds like "game of law")
i love this game !!
Looks similar to toc, but it's not a very famous game in France I believe
Also, two card games are really popular :
-	Tarot (with a special deck of 78 cards)
-	Belotte and belotte coinche
One of the most frustrating games ever \^\^
Basically you have to reach the end of a 1000km road by playing cards (a "50" card makes you move 50km)
Except you can't move if the traffic lights are red, and they tend to stay red for a very, very long time
In France, Lille, probably
And they are right to ignore it
Toulouse on the contrary, is an underrated city
Nantes perhaps
It's the 6th most populated city in France
Admittedly, I find that surprising myself
Oh, I can chip in here
Banska Bystrica, Povaska Bystrica, Poprad, Cicmany (a village, I know) and another place whose name I can't remember, but we visited a 'bethlehem' there
Žilina has a football team in champion's league sometimes, so it's definitely not unknown
I would bet most Americans who are aware of Bratislava’s existence is because of Eurotrip
Mainly famous because it does not exist, which made it a pretty famous city on internet (IRL it's definitely not so famous outside of Germany)
Most doesn't know mine , which is the 3rd (Lyon) too, except maybe for football lovers
Marseille is a little bit more famour
People generally only knows Paris, Nice and maybe Bordeaux of the wine
My experience of Essen was an open air metal festival on a large square in front of the church/cathedral, on a Sunday
Which was remarked upon by one of the bands, aptly named "Hell". Slight amusement ensued
Otherwise yeah it felt like any generic mid-sized German city
Even in France, it's famous for being an ugly city
Yeah it's probably in the first 5 or so UK cities that'd spring to mind
For those interested, [this cool BBC documentary] about the origins of the genre spends some time talking about the city and its influence on the music
True true true
Toulouse sounds like To lose
Or too loose
I was thinking it is the reason it resonates to British ears
Don't hesitate to travel during winter, there are several ski resorts close by
My very personal opinion: It is a depressing place
Ssshhh keep the secret
Villeurbanne is almost the subburbs of Lyon
150,000 souls, I wouldn't call that a big city
They are doing ok, thank you for asking
Not so many public burnings in Rouen lately, though
> Genua
I am confused, did the Discworld join the EU
It's not the suburbs, it's in Lyon, the only frontier is administrative, it's the 10th arrondissement, really
If by cultural life you mean inbreeding habits and endemic alcoholism, yes
Lille inner city yes, but the urban area must be around 1 million with Roubaix Tourcoing and the smaller cities conforming the [metropolitan area]  of Lille
Haha, I had no idea, I was 100% sure it was a typo
TIL as well I suppose
Empire austro-hongrois ou l'Autriche-Hongrie
Autriche-Hongrie
L'empire Austro-Hongrois
It's about the same as in english
Empire Austro-Hongrois
Empire Austro-Hongrois in French
We complain about everything and get nothing done
We choose to instaure something and then we complain about it, we are lazy, people from Paris are always in a hurry, and we surrender in ww2
Hmmmmm
I am from France and people say that all french people smokes
It is fucking sadly true
The problem is I am almost the single one to not smoke in my family
BUT
Moreover, while others smokes, It seems like I am alergic of cigarettes
When someone smokes near to me (in the same room etc
), My nose get fucking stuffed so I can't breath so I breath stronger and stronger so my throat dies
Moreover, when I say my ma' She is hurting me and that I hate it, she mocks me like : Uuh, you are faking this, blablabla
Another sadly true stereotype is that french people doesn't speak english well
I Think it can be pretty true
In my class, at school, only a minority would be able de speak english goodly
We eat baguette everytime
We have a lot of smokers
You find cigarette butts everywhere on the sidewalks and it's kind of depressing
Vaping is getting more and more popular with the youth though so that's a plus
Also we don't pick up our dog shit
It's not exactly culturally accepted (leaving your dog shit on the sidewalk is obviously frowned upon) and if you ask any french if he picks up his dog's shit he'll tell you he does but in a real life situation, if it's too inconvenient and nobody's watching, he just won't.
Actually, yes we complain a lot but we actually get shit done
French workers are among the most productive (in productivity per hour) in Europe
I would have said the same for French people
Why ?
I agree, except for the lazy part
To be fair, the people asking for something to be implemented are not the ones that will tend to be complaining about it afterwards
We're not a hivemind
That a 3rd trait : whenever French ppl manage to pull something cool, other French have to either ignore it or poop on it with a long list on why it's not impossibly perfect
We hold each other to impossibly idealistic standard, to the point of being detrimental
Which is more expensive to use than planes, so people take planes instead
Also it's highly uneaven, the middle of the country has no such system
Well it’s just me lol
Not every time I agree, but there are still people complaining about everything
So that's nice
Now that's a persistent cliché. We're in the lower part of the chart indeed, but it's not *that* significant, we're talking about less than an hour less than average, weekly, cf: [
Well done
^You ^twat <3
We are on our 5th *republican* constitution; the previous ones were adopted in 1793 (1st Republic), 1848, 1875, 1946
Our current Constitution, the Constitution of the French **Fifth** Republic, was adopted on the 4th of October 1958
Since then, it has been modified **24 times**.
Modifications of the Constitution are regulated by the article 89 of the Constitution itself, under the [Title XVI - On amendments to the Constitution]
A modification of the Constitution can be proposed by the President (on council of the Prime Minister) or by the members of Parliament
Out of the 24 modifications so far, 22 were proposed by the President
Both chambers of Parliament (National Assembly & Senate) have to adopt the text of the "constitutionnal law" (name of the text amending the constitution) in the same terms
Once this is done, the law can either be adopted by referendum (happened once, in 2000), or by the Congress (both chambers of the Parliament reunited in the Versailles Palace), where it requires 3/5 of the cast votes to pass
The Constitution cannot be modified if the territorial integrity of France is threatened; and the Republican form of the Government can't be changed either
2 modifications were a bit peculiar: the very first one (1960) was made using a special procedure pertaining the remnant of our colonial empire, which has been removed since
The second one (1962) is debated to this day: article 11 allows the President to submit a bill directly to referendum, by-passing Parliament
The Constitution only allows this procedure to be used in some domains, yet in 1962, Charles de Gaulle submited a constitutional reform directly to the French people, ignoring the procedure of the article 89
He was successful, and changed the method of election of the President of the Republic (from an *indirect* vote, to a *direct* one), which had a massive impact of the dynamics and balances of the institutions of the Republic (the French President is called a "Republican monarch" in some academic texts as a result)
He tried again in 1969, was rejected, and resigned as a consequence; no President has tried to pull this stunt again since
[Many times] especially in the 19th century when it was a rollercoaster
And it was done in every way possible and imaginable
Coups d'état, revolts, defeats in war etc
De nem lehet haragudni a kedves miniszterelnöktek ellen, ő olyan ártatlan néz ki
"écureuil"  from latin "scūriolus" taken form ancien greek "σκίουρος", made of  "σκὶα", "shadow",  and "οὐρά", "tail"
It may be hard to pronounce, I think the "euil" thing is tricky for non native speakers
And that's only by repeating, good luck from reading it
It's  "[e] if you know how to read this
Exporting weapons to countries forbidden by an European agreement
If I remember correctly, EU members signed an agreement saying that selling weapons to an authoritarian, totalitarian regime, a government involved in a civil war or conventional war, unstable politically, a government who is suspected to use it against civilians, is forbidden
Mostly the weapon sales, but it's not the only thing
Macron likes to paint an image for himself abroad that his government seems to have trouble following
in terms of environment for example, most measures put in place are on a local scale, not much has been done nationally
Same
And to Egypt too
Came here for this one
Also Egypt
In first year of med school, about half of the students go to a "prépa" to help better their chances in the 2nd year admission exam (15% where I go)
A good amount of students still have to do their first year a second time to pass
Jusqu'à l'année dernière, la première année c'était PACES, et tu pouvais payer 2000euros par semestre pour avoir une "prépa privée" en dehors de la fac qui te fournit les fiches de cours, des méthodes, des entrainements pour le concours etc
Et depuis cette année la première année c'est PASS ou LAS (et là plus de redoublement possible) mais peux toujours payer une prépa privée qui te donne les fiches de cours etc
Les facs essaient de contrer ça en créant des séances de tutorat par des élèves d'année supérieure pour une somme modique (30 euros)
Moi j'ai eu de la chance, on était la dernière promo paces a lille l'année dernière et ils nous ont laissé redoubler, donc maintenant on est un groupe séparé des PASS/LAS, genre la "paces residuelle" pour cette année. Et pareil, j'ai fait tutorat à cause du prix de la prépa !
It depends whether or not you have enough room on your shelves/on your fridge I guess
I’ve seen both, depending on the layout of the kitchen
Some people seem to store them in the fridge out of convenience mostly
I never put them in the fridge
Basically if it’s not in the fridge in the store I don’t put it in the fridge at home
I store them in the fridge to extend their life a bit
I don't like the idea of eating eggs stored at room temperature and near the expiration date, especially in Summer
Very surprised to see most people seem to store them in their fridge
I don't think I've ever encountered that, and it seems like a waste of valuable fridge space
This abomination called UHT milk ? I don't understand how some people drink that
The taste is awful
>Soup
Interesting, how do you use your eggs with a soup
Thank you, I'll try it next time I'm doing a soup
I didn't think about that, but my knowledge of asian cuisine is quite limited to be honest
Salted butter and butter
It spared me from having to pedantically correct people in French (since it's now officially legitimate), so I like that
It does sound wrong to me though, still
I was this close to upvoting you, and you had to go and ruin it
As long as we all agree that "croissant au chocolat" is nonsense, then fine
This is not a useless topic
This is a major national issue that needs to be discussed and solved
How can we be considered a civilized country when some people still say "chocolatine"?
Wait, so when people in North England invite people "for tea", it's for a full meal ?
Huh
I know pannetone (quite good), never heard of a pandoro, what is that ?
21st of June like in the rest of the world
I love that it's "pommes" in German, which comes from "pommes frites" in French but just means "apples". Because we call potatoes "earth apples". Languages are weird
The actual best combination is Nutella after eating some chips
Try it and you'll thank me later
And by chips I don't mean French fries
People are saying "la Nutella" ???
The fuck is wrong with them ?
Last trip to London I was struck with the infamy that is a *chocolate croissant*. That was just your standard pain au chocolat, mind you
A pandoro is like panettone but without the horrible raisins and other useless stuff inside
And bigger and more fluffy
Because Germans
La nutella sound like shit tho
Why does it make so much sense ?
>Pandoro
For someone who doesn't like raisins, this sounds lovely
I'd miss the raisins, but I gotta say a softer dough sounds pretty good
I mean the summer solstice has been called that since roman times, I wouldn't argue it's particularly a French thing or ever has been
I had no idea this wasn't considered the norm in all of the west, but happy to have learnt it
Saying "passes moi la nutella" sounds just
wrong
Now I personally don't put milk into my tea, but that microwave business is just rude
Our whole language is built around assigning randoms genders to things because it sounds better this way
So the fact that two words in -a don't have the same gender is nothing unusual
What are the songs from your country that always come up during karaoke
Les démons de minuit
That was the goto end-of-party song at my engineering school
[L’aventurier by Indochine ] another song everyone knows that comes up often
It's also used to signal the customers the bar/club is about to close
Yup
Played at weddings and basically anytime the clock strikes 1am at a party of some kind
I heard it was the song that is always played late at night for any party/wedding
Yeah it’s kinda funny actually, it’s about an Irish guy who goes to war (I think ?) and remembers his country and the Connemara
And it’s a pinnacle of French popular culture
Don’t ask me why, I don’t know
Edith : it’s actually not about going to war at all, but about a catholic Irish dude marrying his catholic Irish girlfriend and partying like there is no tomorrow with all their Irish friends
You have to forgive me, I had never listened to it while being sober so I had no clue what the words were about
Yeah it's a song about that place
The singer never set foot there
Go figure
Yes and the lyrics are pro United Ireland:
« They still believe that the day will come
It's very close, when the Irish
Will make peace around the cross
There, in the Connemara
They know the cost of war
There, in the Connemara
They don't accept
The Welsh's peace
Or the kings of England's one »
I'm glad Wonderwall was added after a Beatles song was added to the list, since it can't exist without the existence of the Beatles
Although we have trains that cross borders, we unfortunately don’t have any transeuropean train (that I know about) that crosses multiple borders
Se we have to use plane for long-distance travelling
price is probably the main factor for me
At longer distances, planes rapidly become cheaper, and also significantly faster
Plane:
* Usually 30 to 60 minutes to reach the airport
* 60 to 90 minutes of luggage drop off, security checks, and waiting time at the gate
* The flight itself
* 30 minutes dissembark and luggage waiting time
* 30 to 60 minutes to reach your final destination
Ultra minimum of 2 hours of non flying time, up to 3hrs45
Train:
* Usually 10 to 30 minutes to reach the station
* 15 minutes to reach the platform and your car
* Actual travel time
* 10 to 30 minutes to reach your final destination
Ultra minimum of 25 mins of non travel time, up to 75 minutes
You can start looking at the plane option when train travel times exceed 3 hours
Depends greatly how direct is the travel
For example to go from Paris to Toulouse (680km south) you don't go straight to it, you have to pass through Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast (580km south of Paris, 250km west of Toulouse) and the line between Bordeaux and Toulouse is a snail
So the train takes the same time as the more direct trajectory on the highway (maybe one hour less now with the newer Paris-Bordeaux line) and you just take the plane because 680km by plane is like 50min (and the price isn't that different either
On the other hand the trains that go to England, Netherlands and Belgium are direct so it seems like a normal travel
It happened to me to have a plane change at Amsterdam airport for a flight to Paris and consider actually finishing with the train instead
So to answer your question, depends how many train changes and how direct the train is
If I'm not going somewhere in France or Switzerland it's going to be plane or car
From Paris, I've been to London, Geneva, Frankfurt, Koln/Cologne, Bruxelles, Luxemburg, all within 5hours train
I used to take longer (6-7hours) ride to go to the south of France, but now the high speed train takes us there in 4ish, and with little kids, 7h would be a long ride
When I was young (80s, 90s) we were taking night trains to Italy, but the service dwindled
I think the French railway is trying to resurrect the service
I really like the train, I was able to make a round trip in Germany heavily pregnant and nobody asked when I was due or if the doctor agreed to my travel
I've visited the rest by car or bus, I hardly take planes within Europe, except to go in islands like Ireland and Cyprus, or Russia
And on transit to somewhere else of course
Wait
The Eurostar goes to Amsterdam ?
I thought it was only Paris-London
That’s awesome ! I thought the Orient Express was the only transcontinental train !
Secularism doesn't mean that the political party need to be non religious
If you represent the state, you can't promote a political, a religious  or a non religious ideology because the state is neutral
Deputies, senator and member of the government can promote a  political or religious ideology because they represent the people not  the state
As weird as it may sounds, I can't see the Eiffel Tower from my window
Military history
Anglo movies mostly
The last turd is "The King" from Netflix
You mean you don't spend your days saying "top o the mornin to ya"?
With your unreasonable love for cheesy romcoms, it's literally impossible you could be villains nowadays in any way
I don't even like red wine
I'm a disgrace to my country
To be fair, there is a small part of it in Lyon too
And Windmills
Yes of course, probably when I was around 5-6 years old ? And before that, I used to ride a tricycle, starting maybe at 3 or 4 years old ?
I know people who can't - or, perhaps more accurately, have never learned to - ride a bicycle
It's uncommon but certainly not unheard of
Yup
I learnt it at age 6 or 7
or maybe 8 I don't remember
No, I was never taught how to
Even though my brother was
The only people I know who can't or learned very late grew up poor or with too many siblings to afford bikes
A post nuclear war such as fallout where we will follow Swiss people leaving their bunker to discover how Europe become
I think doing a « Detroit: Become Human » type of game (multiple choices game with a large tree of possibilities) about the French Revolution would be pretty lit I think
Following a member of the National Assembly, a noble from Louis XVI’s cour, and a revolutionary provincial peasant
as a Noble we could choose to plot against the King, to serve our interests or rallying the people’s cause
as a member of the National Assembly, choosing between the Montagnard and the Girondins etc
as a revolutionary peasant, you could try to lead you own revolt in your region
One of the ending would be what actually happened and the others could be totally made up
The crusades, the Napoleonic empire, both World Wars
But my favorite might be the French Revolution before Napoleon's arrival to power
I would love to see one in prehistory time, when homo Sapiens arrived in Europe (from africa, via Asia) and found Neandertalian men already there, being physicly stronger but still more primitive and they needed to live together
They probably had some fight, some battle for hunting territories, we know they also had some barter and also had babies together
We call the Brits the "rosbif", it comes from "roasted beef", that's because it's how they look when they leave their country to go to France on Holiday and their skin sees the sun for the first time in months
Nicknames for countries :
* Germany : Outre-Rhin  (across the Rhine)
* Italy : la botte (the boot)
* United Kingdom : la perfide Albion (perfidious Albion)
We can also refer to anything Italian as "transalpin" (from across the Alps)
Some pretty offensive ones
* Germans : chleuhs or boches (widely used during WWI and II)
* Italians : ritals (apparently comes from the massive immigration of italian workers to France after WWII, their ID mentioned "R. ital
" for "réfugié italien", "italian refugee")
* British : rosbifs (from roast beefs)
* Portuguese : portos or guesh
English : Rosbif
German : Boche
Italian : Rital
Spanish : espingoin
Russian: russkof
Polish : Polak
These are not endearing surnames though, usually used in a negative way
«Boche», «Fridolin» and many more for the german
«Ritals» for italians
Possibly « Espingouin» for spanish
«Rosbifs» for englishmen
Their country as «Perfide Albion».
Rosbifs for brits, frenchified version of "roast beef", germans are "boches" (more or less pronounces bosh)
I've heard people in France referring to tourists from the North (England, the Netherlands, Germany and so on) as strawberry-vanilla ice creams, cause when they come in summer they get all red and white with sunburns and tanning marks
Interesting, as a french I’ve never heard that one
Is there a meaning behind it
Belgium is Outre Quiévrain
I would wager that it represents a lot of people, and since your demographics are a disaster, I advice you to reconsider, cugino d'oltralpe : )
Totally, we too, cheese eating surrendering monkeys, don't have offensive name for our British friends
I fail to see how since it's wrong
I stand corrected, that's from our American friends, you just call us frogs
Which is wrong
Says the Dane grinding his axe, ready to go to war over Skaneland any day against those bloody Swedes
Ha yeah, I can see how that would cause some confusion when not understanding a single bloody word they were saying but that one
Definitely and this shit needs to die
If you really want to insult us with something related to food, try snails
We focus on France, the Résistance and the Libération
The Eastern Front (Stalingrad mostly) is also a big part of the program for WW2, to  give an example of the atrocities of the war
Not much being said about the Pacific front, except the atomic bombs
In France it naturally focuses on the Occupation and the Collaboration, and also somewhat on the Resistance
By that we have recommended readings, like the [Appeal of 18 June] acts of Resistance hero [Jean Moulin] [Vichy government] atrocities such as the [Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]
Surrounding WW2, recommended novels are obviously "the Diary of Anne Frank", "If This Is a Man" by Primo Levi, and also ["The Silence of the Sea"] by Vercors, which is surely a Franco-French piece not very well known outside of France
It's a short story written during the Occupation by a French resistance nationalist
It's a very humanist book, that even humanizes the German occupier, and I highly recommend it if you can get your hand on it
A hugely popular French author from the second half of the 20th century called Robert Merle became famous with his 1952 book [Death is my Trade] which is a fictionalized biography of Rudolf Höss who was the commander of Auschwitz
It was recommended reading to me in middle school, and I discovered I could enjoy adult books with this one
Very shocking material though, as it's about how Rudolf Höss imagined efficient ways to the Final Solution
Once we're through with French-centric subjects, we naturally mostly focus on the Liberation thanks to American and British (and Canadian
and some French) forces
Sometimes we focus on Colonial forces because that's politically correct
We don't talk a lot about how important the Russian front was
We learn that got wrecked in the first round because of gross incompetence from our generals and then spent the rest of the war with a minority of people resisting the germans, a minority of people collaborating with the germans and a majority of people who had a hard enough time surviving that they felt like doing neither
Among other things I remember being shown the “Night and Fog” movie with quite moving footages from the camps
I might be blending my history courses with my personal reading on the subject, but here I go
We start the WW2 courses with the interwar period
As far as I can remember we've got a whole part of the history starting with a short intro in 1870 and then WWI, the interwar and finally WW2
In the interwar period we study a bit of French politics with the Front Populaire as well as the French mentality before the war
We see that France don't believe in an upcoming war
And that we were too proud of our victory in the WWI thus doing nothing regarding military
We study the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain too
But we mainly focus on Germany and the rise of Hitler
So we have infos about how he founded the NSDAP and how he rose to power because of the situation Germany was in because of the Treaty/diktat of Versailles
Then we have a short passage about French diplomats trying to meet Hitler to stop him invading Poland by sending warning messages
We had a brief intro to the German-Russian alliance I think
Then war, we focus on how the fact the Germans took the Ardennes to stomp us in 6 weeks and that we were absolutely not prepared
But we don't have infos on the various battles that occurred during that time
Then we study Vichy France and Resistant France a lot
We study a lot of propaganda, the cooperation of the French government with Nazis
The *rafles* , the way the Alsace-Lorraine's workers are used for German industry
I remember learning about German resistance too, but that was maybe in my German classes and not History
We then have the liberation part
The arrival of the USA and USSR and so on
We spend some times on the Normandy Landings
We have the discovery of concentration camps too
We spend a lot of time on Holocaust too
I think we have some infos about Soviet massacres too, or maybe it's in another course about the Soviet Union
Then it's the end of the war
We study the aftermath in France, how Nazis partisans are hunted, humiliated and judged
We then continue the history with the 4th and 5th Republic parts for a short time
Oh I think I forgot something
Général de Gaulle is good, Pétain is bad
Which is recalled a lot of times in the books
Man it seems so unreal
We study it for 3 or 4 month EVERY YEAR from secondary school to the end of high school
Same for WW1
I'm not exaggerating when I say we spend 6 month per year learning about WW1 and WWII
* King Saint Louis and crusades
* Richelieu
* Napoleon
* French Colonial Empire
* De Gaulle
because he’s not as badass as the others
In terms of poultry, French cuisine is rather varied
Chicken of course, but also quail, duck, goose, pigeon, guinea fowl and more rarely birds from hunting such as ortolans, woodcock or pheasant
It's quite out of fashion, but it was also quite common to eat the necks and legs of poultry, and still today traditional stuffings are made from poultry heart and liver
There is even a dish called  "le rôti sans pareil" or "the roast without equal" which consists of stuffing 17 birds into each other !
Ortolans are protected aren't they
last year, a bird protection group confronted an ortolan hunter who attacked them with a shovel, still in his briefs
Made national headlines
For those wondering, have you ever seen that vietnam style american dad episode ?
> There is even a dish called "le rôti sans pareil" or "the roast without equal" which consists of stuffing 17 birds into each other !
Don't forget to end by a stuffed olive or the taste will be ruined
Not super common, but it's still eat quite often
Not of the whole of french cuisine but it is definitely a staple of Gascon cuisine
I have two duck products on hand right now, two organic duck magrets in my freezer and one bag of pulled pork-style confit de canard
On the other hand I don’t have anything chicken related (except eggs, does that count) as I find it very bland
Last new year's meal
It depends where you live
People in south west of France would eat duck more regularly
Especially in areas as Gers or Landes
They mostly use duck or goose fat to cook
Foie gras, terrines, aiguillons and magret are fairly common dishes
I refer to this as litteral food porn
"Je lui mange le derrière"
It also depends of your family's income
Duck isn't cheap
Those that were bombed during WW2 and had to be rebuilt real quick in the 1950s. Thinking Brest & Toulon, for example
The only exception I can think of would be Saint-Malo, for some unknown reason the rebuilt buildings there are 100% ok
Plus the towns that were extended & changed a lot to attract tourists on the southern-eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the 1960s-1970s (same goes for some ski stations)
Yeah I’d definitely go with some city on the Côte d’Azur
Used to be small cute fishermen villages and now are large, glorified retirement homes
Saint-Étienne is famous for being ugly
It looks exotic I would like to visit
Je suis d’accord, mais surtout pour le port
La ville elle-même peut avoir un certain intérêt quand on aime l’architecture moderne (il parait qu’elle a une grande unité et que ce ne sont pas seulement des barres, ce genre de choses)
Après je n’y suis jamais allée, donc j’aurais du mal à en parler !
I was thinking of cities in Occitanie, rather
Those really were built out of nowhere for tourists and locals alike, whereas the Côte d’Azur has a history of tourism and the buildings that go with it (not everything was built in the 1960s-1970s there)
But hey, I’m from Marseille
I’m biased :)
La Grande Motte
Yes, I don’t know why this town is an exception among WW2-destroyed cities but I’m glad it is
-10 isn't that bad, honestly
It's cold, sure, but as long as you're dressed appropriately, it's fine
Although if you're used to greek temperatures, I guess it could be awful
C’est du béton presque partout
Le centre a été presque entièrement rasé pendant la guerre
Le Havre ? Oui, mais la seule personne que je connais qui y soit allée a bien aimé, comme quoi ce ne serait pas du béton moche (penser barres et grands ensembles façon La Rouvière à Marseille, ou Norilsk en Russie)
Donc bon, je ne suis pas sûre d’être convaincue mais, tant que je n’y suis pas allée, je ne me prononce pas
Do people mock you because of your accent ?
When I say accent I mean "district's accent".
I have a pretty  *S T R O N G*  German like accent (I'm alsacian) so some people be like "Hans get in the Panzerkampfwagen IV". I find it really funny because they can't say it correctly
I have a Breton accent and lived all my life in the south west of France
Other children mocking me was common in my childhood
But now it's very rare
I work as a French language teacher and I feel karma's at work when I hear some of my colleagues having to tone down their southern accent in order to being understood
I worked on toning down my accent years ago when I first left my home region and started getting comments from *everybody* on it, since I have one of the most recognizable and mocked accent of France (Marseille)
But whenever I slipped up, I would get smart remarks
I spent 2 years in Strasbourg, the only thing things I couldn't get used to about the alsatian accent were *vingT*, and the lack of un/in distinction
Lovely accent otherwise :p
Not a "regional" accent, I'm American, and after I speak a sentence or two, people who don't know me say "You have a little accent, are you British
" Which in the region where I live, isn't unreasonable
They think you are German because Scottish accent is somehow like the German accent
They both are "strong" accent
This is the only explanation that I can find
I know a French guy who learned English in Scotland
He has the best accent ever
It's like they eat the word that's hilarious
To be honest I never really noticed a strong accent from Brittany but then again most Bretons I'm friend with have been either born in the Paris region or lived there for most of their life
My only other contacts with Bretons is when we defend the Mont Saint-Michel from daily raids of bretons trying to steal it
is "how's your boot bitin' ?" used, or should i keep on pretending ?
Oh yeah I know that
My dad is from Wien and every time we travel to Germany, I'm the translator
But even with an accent not as strong as my father, Germans have some trouble to understand me x)
Ah, that sweet southern accent that I never seem to be able to understand (I'm from the East)
it is an unusual association, I can't imagine how it sounds
French people say Panzer generally
But when they want to imitate someone with a German accent (or a German) they *try* to say it in its entirely
Every time it's like they shallow the entire word
In Alsace we pronounce the T in huit
Why this word have so differents pronunciations ?
Keine Sorge, Er ist nicht ein Maller
I consider my accent pretty close to the "standard" French accent (media/journalism)
But it's super different from the southwestern accent
I'm not fluent in any matter
I can understand a little bit and talk a little bit that's all
Regional languages have been dying due to the French government forbidding their use in the beginning of 20th century
So it was my grandparents mother tongue, but my dad only understands it, and I, the third generation, can barely speak it
I was mentioning Breton as a geographical part of France, for OP to understand I had a different accent in French than others around me
Well, as I said, I don't find my accent particularly strong when you compare it with the "norm". But compared to the southwestern accent, it is pretty different, hence the mocking when I was a child
The first time I met him, we started speaking French, but as soon as he found out I spoke English, he switched, and his accent threw me
"Is he Scottish
" I thought
No, just such a wonderful accent
That it is I'll never forget when someone from Perpignan introduced themselves to me that accent is definitely something
Dear Dutch people from AskEurope, how do you feel about sea level rise projections, and the threat of seeing the Netherlands sinking into the sea
Joke aside, I live in Paris but my family lives in the center of France, in a region which was impacted by this summer's heatwave beyond belief
To give you an idea, the government launched restrictions on the use of water as the phreatic zones were drying out at light speed
So now I'm helping them to install a rain water tank, and we'll see if we can find ways to properly insulate the house
But TBH my guts tell me that this battle is already lost and they better move to Britanny for instance, before the next temperature rise transform the area into a desert
... you got me in a box here
In French, "Je m'excuse" instead of "Excusez moi". Literally "I excuse myself" instead of "Excuse me".
^(Yes, we are arrogant :))
Ça va / sa va (sa va is never correct, never ever
Stop writing that
Please)
Also people who mistake er and é at the end of verbs (like j'ai manger instead of j'ai mangé)
Drives me nuts
And the most infuriating one : *ça* (this) vs *sa* (his/her, as in "his/her house" for example) !
"Wrong" expressions that people say thinking they make them sound smart but since they are mistaken it just makes them sound stupid as hell just drive me crazy, worst offender:
* "Au jour d'aujourd'hui": "hui" by itself already means "on this (present) day" even though it's not used as a standalone word anymore, aujourd'hui therefore means "on the day of on this (present) day", "au jour d'aujourd'hui" therefore means "on the day of on the day of on this (present) day". STOP THIS MADNESS PEOPLE
Inverting the verb and the pronouns in a negative imperative sentence : *Aime-la pas*.
Explanation: in French, usually, any pronoun comes before the verb: *Tu l'aimes* / You love her
However, in an imperative sentence, they come after the verb: *Aime-la !* / Love her
Except if the sentence is negative, then the classical structure is used: *Ne l'aime pas !* / Don't (you) love her
Also ça/sa, ça is demonstrative while sa is the possessive
One that my sister says "ils croivent" instead of "ils croient", I hate it very much
Salut sa va ? /s
Also what native French speakers tend to miss is writing the “s” at the end of a word in plural
I guess it’s because it’s not pronounced, but it just drives me crazy
No, Pierre, there are two chairssssss not two chair
This sentence is not wrong, it is just redundant (it's a pleonasm)
I would argue that the one that needs to stop is "impacter": the fuck is this shit, honestly
A vast majority of native French people drop the "ne" in casual conversation
"ne pas" is mostly used in written French and formal conversation
It doesn't exist in French, it was created by copying the English "to impact", which is translated as "to have an impact on" (*avoir un impact sur*) or to affect (*affecter*)
Paying interns is mandatory if they work more than two months
Minimum is 3,75€/hour
That's 500~600€/month
If less than two month it's legal to not pay them
It is legally required in France
At least "official" internships, signed between a university and a  company
>Fair to say: I was a little bummed I could only get €200,- but the job itself is very nice, and I know most influential companies pay more (I intern at a small company with around 16 employees, my roommate who interns at a bigger firm got €500/month)
3,9/hour now, I'm becoming rich
To put things into persepective (because cost of life an salaries vary greatly within the EU), our minimum wage for a "real job" is at 10
25€/hr before taxes
I have to do an internship at a law firm (specialised in criminal law) this summer
I had to lie and pretend I would work for less than two months because otherwise they wouldn't take me as an intern
This type of arrangement is encouraged by our professors and our university
They basically told us to be grateful to have the opportunity to do an internship and to never ask to be paid (it's extremely difficult to find one because of the coronavirus)
Also an internship cannot be longer than 6 months and it has to be part of a school program
So that companies don't exploit young people
Only for internships exceeding 2 months
I had the choice to take an internship in my 3rd semester of master's degree for a semester, and it was mandatory for it to be unpaid + minimum 37 hours a week
I found it quite stupid as I wanted to do it in France (did a MA in relation to French culture), and I couldn't do it as internships over 2 months are paid there
And as I'm an international, I needed to work to get SU, so working + internship was like +50 hours a week, so I ended up taking random lessons instead, and almost none of the international students I know didn't do an internship for the same reason
6+ month internships in engineering are paying around 1500€/month in Paris
Companies often hope interns would join the company after degree so they pay them the triple of the legal minimum (still way below an entry job wage)
It's the bullshit 1-2 months internships that are either not paid or paid that low
I can't tell for the other fields however
Yup
There are some basic rules of what constitutes an internship
yes I heard that a lot for engineering but unfortunately it's no the case for many other fields
I'm doing an 5 months internship at a French embassy and I'm paid 3,9
yep, i did three months at 1200€/month and that was quite nice as a first year undergrad
On the other hand you don't pay 900€/month for 25m2 in a decent Tallinn suburb
I don't know how it balances out
Below two months is still legally an internship but good luck to be paid
And even then the mandatory paid internships beyond 2 months can still be legally paid waaaaaay below the minimal wage
Around 2400€/month after all taxes
If you live alone you will probably spend a third of it in rent however
That's like 5 cinema tickets more than the cost of a permanent parking spot downtown Paris
Got an extra room for me ?
as someone who lived there when I was a kid, I remember being a bit disappointed
I expected skyscrapers to be the glass and steel kind you would see in newer cities
I was still quite impressed by the size of some buildings once i lived inside
Sadly the quality of the construction was terrible
I remember quite well our super intendant (building super intendant are not something common in France at all) telling us we shouldn’t expect high water pressure cause we live in a 50 year old building
My childhood apartment in paris is 120 and has great pressure
I remember finding some off the pseudo hausmanian buildings quite funny
They looked hausmannian
but were 30 stories tall
I quite like the classic look of the typical NYC skyscraper, brown, small windows, and ornaments
Kinda like the san remo
I have vertigo when looking at high buildings from the ground, so I was feeling quite uneasy
Well, the NYC subway works and takes you quickly where you want to go, but it's dirty and ugly
The London tube is very clean, but parts of it are always shutdown (often for months if not years), and it drops you off a mile from your destination
The two need to learn from each other
Disney's Moana is called Vaiana in France and some other countries I think for copyright reasons
If you speak french, look up some québécois translations, I don't have any examples, but this is quitr funny
Despicable Me is translated as Moi, Moche et Méchant (I, ugly and mean)
Despicable Me: Me, ugly and evil ( Moi, moche et méchant)
We have the same weird translation for "Home Alone" ('Maman j'ai raté l'avion') and "Home Alone 2" was translated to "Mom I've missed the plane again" ('Maman j'ai encore raté l'avion')
In french it's "Nos étoiles contraires" wich means something like their stars are very differents froms the others ones normal people have
But it's a wordplay because in french "being born under a good star" ( or a bad one ) means you are lucky or not
Also it's another wordplay with the fact ( spoiler )>! despite they have the same bad star, the cancer, one of them will die and the other one live, so they both have a bad star but even so those stars are going each in their own different trajectory, hence the title
Pulp fiction is really funny in Québec
The translation's right but really weird to read lol (Fiction Pulpeuse)
I kept scrolling for Very Bad Trip, for some reason the sheer absurdity of that non translation makes me giggle every time
Its almost the same in french but it’s "Me, Ugly and Evil"
I have read this book years ago so I dont remember much about her situation in the end >!( except she is alive ) and I am not very familiar with cancers and if people can be cured or not, so I don't know if she went to a kind of normal life after or likely died shortly after Gus and the story
Twice, but it was in Argentina
I wasn't robbed but threatened
First time by a crackhead that threatened to put a bullet through my brain if I didn't give him everything I had, second by a 15y/o with a knife
The first one just walked away after a while (he didn't actually pull out a gun but he grabbed me by the collar while screaming that he wanted to kill me, so at this point I don't care if he had one or not, it was scary enough as it was), the second one ran away after the friend I was with strated to scream "Policía !" like a maniac
In my younger years I've been jumped and beaten twice in France during a concert and during a town party (a feria like Pamplona) but there is always alcohol involved so unfortunately this kind of shit happens
A guy stole my mp3 player like 12-13 years ago but that's all
Got my wallet stolen from a pool locker once
Got assaulted once as well after one of my friends drunkenly talked shit to a group of thugs (I obviously don’t hang out with this guy anymore)
Yep, I've always been very unlucky
Pickpocket, sexual harrassment, moral harrassment etc
But the worst is the surgeon who raped me when I was 7
Yes, my life sucks
Edit : [more context
Nope
Yet
My car was broken into once
They were nice enough to break the small window on the rear passenger door instead of the big one
Thanks for that, I guess
Assaulted by three kids who were mugging a quiet nerd type
Got punched in the mouth and beaten randomly in the street, they didn't event try to steal me something
Just for fun
Did you file a complaint/grievance against the students and professor
Is/was your grandfather a judge or carabinieri
I lived in Sicily for 2 years
One of my coworkers had gone to Palermo for a weekend
The police had the road closed, and there was smoke visible ahead of them
It was Giovanni Falcone's car which had been blown up
From France, I have two recommendation :
Fatal Bazooka : parodic french rap, from the early 2000's. "[Fous ta cagoule] (Put on your hoddie) is a must, while I also recommend "[Mauvaise fois nocturne] (nightly bad faith)
Ultra Vomit : parodic metal group
Most of the songs in their album "Panzer Surprise
" are also a must:  [Kammthaar] (parodying Rammstein), [Takoyaki] (after the Japanese dish), [Évier Métal] (french pun for "Heavy Metal", here meaning "Sink Metal")
I thought it was going to be our Benoît, tourne-toi, from your description
Exact same story
> here in Germany french rap is very popular among young people
Really ? Who would have thought ? Thanks for your comment, I've learned something new ! Also, I'm glad to know that you enjoyed some of my suggestions
Poland is called Childland
So how would you differentiate Vaterland and Heimat
I think i remember that Heimat is a kind of translation of home
It’s « la patrie », so basically it’s neutral because it’s balanced
Never thought of it as mother or father
Sometimes it’s called « la mère patrie » though, so
the mother father Lol
>‘Patrie’ is literally ‘fatherland’, so you can’t go around telling people that France refers to their home country as a female
We don't? Some even say "la mère patrie", looks quite feminine imo
That's just a normal window, the second type is especially everywhere
Not the most common but still not uncommon I would say
My father's house had them built in and he had this house built more than ten years ago
My home built in the early 90's have those
In France we originally called *vasistas* (same German origin) an opening inside a door or a window
([Like this] which explains why we would call it "what is this ?" as its purpose is to literally check "what/who is this".)
But today you can also call [this] (left side) *vasistas* in French, by extension
But it is more commonly called *velux*.
Yes, but it made its way into everyday language, like *Sopalin* for paper towel rolls, *Canadair* for water bombers, *Abribus* for bus stop shelters, *Mobylette* for mopeds and many others
Like you have *Hoover* for vacuum cleaners or *Kleenex* for paper tissues in English
(We use that last one too
> Abribus for bus stop shelter
Wait, Abribus is not the generic name
My life is upside down right now
Nope ! The french name is *aubette* but I have yet to hear someone call it that way, Abribus is JCDecaux's trademark ! :p
lol, it's like i'm asking you : do you have a channel in the US where you are rebuilding 1000 year old castle ?
&#x200B;
No pun intended ... but it's just how it feels like from our end
Karim Debbache is the GOAT
[Justine Leconte] although she happens to produce videos in English, and [Hugo Jacomet] (who does both French and English)
Virtually all the French-speaking content I come across is very mediocre and, worse than anything, spoken in very poor French (which I can't stand)
I kinda like joyca, he's funny
Le Rire Jaune are okay
Maxestla
"Le joueur du grenier"
A channel with content about video games, new and old
He also have another, "Le bazar du grenier" more up to date content
Another that i find fun sometimes:
They made a serie called "Noob" which tell the story of gamers in a MMORPG
ALT 236 is the one I enjoy the most, he makes videos about art and pop culture with a superb atmosphere and editing
Joueur du Grenier, a video game youtuber !
The [Joueur du grenier]
Lindy's a cunt
Matt Easton (Schola Gladatoria) is the superior Brit historical weaponry youtuber
a lot fo french speaking people of my generation (late 1990) discovered youtube with DiabloX9's videos
He is Swiss and was the biggest French speaking youtuber for a long time
Technically not a "YouTuber" though
What is he up to these days
Haven't seen him release anything in ages
I think he made it to trending accross the world recently
I discovered him a couple weeks ago
He's writing for the JDG
As much as I'm allowed to warrant people about him being insufferable at times for whoever's not a British supremacist
Every morning with colleagues and acquaintances
With very close friends I will often do the bise unless it’s unpractical (if I meet them in a crowded pub or something)
A solid handshake is important in France
If it's someone close, male or female, there may be a bise (kiss on the cheek)
I'm an American, and a friend had stopped by to visit, and when we were out for a beer, he called his wife
She asked to speak to me, and my friend says "Hold on, npt's kissing a dude
" When he hands me the phone, she says "Wow, kissing a guy, that's really open of you
We don't even shake hands anymore at work, just "Salut" or "Bonjour ca va". Among my friends though I think the handshake is gone forever
Always "la bise" or a hug unless specified so, in which case we go with informal shakes
Some non Muslim women like it that way too
Bise should never be imposed
My girlfriend is not Muslim and her colleagues know she prefers to shake and everyone is okey with that
Not much of a pets person at all, but if I have to choose, clearly cats
Don't think France has a preference as a whole
city dwellers tend to prefer cats and more rural and suburban people dogs, but that's a very broad generalization
Same goes for Europe as a whole I'd say
I am a huge dog person
And also according to statistics In France we prefer dogs but cats are close !
I love dogs but I am afraid of them
Used to have a golden retriever growing up but we were attacked by 2 boxers once while on a walk
We were close to home so we ran and the dogs followed us all the way to my garden
One caught him at the throat the other on his face
My dog bit off one of the other dog's eye but he survived
Since then I tense up around dogs, can't relax, don't want to get close
They can be super aggressive and people don't understand that
Just because they are nice to you it doesn't mean that their instincts won't kick off when a small ShiTzu starts barking
Just the other day I saw a sign at the entrance of a park
It was an altar for a small dog that had been killed by a German Shepherd
Don't be an asshole
Keep your dog on a leash
If you're at the park, put a muzzle on them
It's the rule but it's not enforced and I hate it
The park is for everyone
Alternatively, I can recommend the documentary Kedi, which is all about cats in Istanbul
In France we have many regional languages (some more used than others) : Breton, Corse, Provençal, Basque, Alsacien, Picard, Créole, Tahitian, Catalan and many more
France
Basque, Occitan and Catalan in the South plus Corsican (curiously close to Romanian)
Other regional languages in the North are Breton (two forms) close to Welsh, Flemish, Alsatian (close to Bavarian German), as well as a multitude of local dialects
In France, there is Breton
It's a celtic language spoken by 200,000 people today
In France we have a lot of "patois" (regional dialects) but we don't concider them languages
Litteraly every region has it's patois
But some are more developped and can be concidered languages such as Aslacien or Breton
I think it's important to distinguish language and dialect
A dialect is a variety of a particular group of the language's speakers
For instance, french people can only understand the french dialects such as:
&#x200B;
* Provençal, Picard, Gallo or Chti which are french dialect (patois);
On another hand,
* Corsican is an italian dialect;
* Alsacien is a german dialect;
* Catalan is a different language, but weirdly very similar to the french one;
* Basque is a completly different language (very interesting btw);
* Breton is different language, even though it's quite close to the welsh language
I don't know much about tahitian and Créole, but I'm pretty sure they're local dialects which are nearly  incomprehensible  for french people
Corsican is not a dialect but its own language too
It's close to italian but has specific phonèmes and constructions, so much so that an Italian wouldn't understand it
Créole is kinda like French and old African languages mixed
> Picard(chti is a synonym) isn't a dialect nor a patois it's its own sister language, the fact it is called patois comes from the francisation that made it look like it is inferior
I don't think a dialect is inferior to french language, I would have loved more diversity in our language
I quite understand you, I don't like when Parisians for instance call Breton "a patois" either
It's just so [different from french] it's definitly not a dialect from here
They make a confusion with gallo, a french dialect from the East of Brittany (my grandparents speak it)
Honestly, I never heard Picard, just the stereoptypes from "bienvenue chez les chtis" but I would not be surprised if it's a different language
Edit: I just checked some texts in [Picard] and I understand everything so yeah, it does sound like a dialect now
Do you know some versions of picard without francisation ?
AJA
Honestly, when I said "dialect", I was meaning "derived from". Considering this logic, I shoud have put Breton as a welsh dialect as well, since I heard welsh people can understand some Breton texts
The Celts from Wales and Cornwell who settled in Brittany arrived during the Vth century
They had privileged commercial relationships with the celtics countries, but that's all
Corsica on another hand was a Roman and then an Italian Region for so long (259 BC - 1768), it's not that weird to think their language derived from Italian and then is an Italian dialect
Well, the weirdest language in France is the Basque language btw
Still don't understand where it come from
Teleperformance is one of the world leaders if not the world leader in the call center field
The company was born in France but it is virtually unknown there
I worked for them in Portugal and they seem fairly big in that country
Schneider Electric , Air Liquide are the ones that come to my mind first
I've read about that company and everything I've seen was AWFUL
Fuck them
Lafarge (world #1 in cement and concrete before their merger with Holcim)
Saint Gobain (materials, founded in 1665 by Colbert, 170k employees)
CMA CGM (4th biggest container transportation company)
Vinci (world 2nd in concessions and construction)
Lactalis (world 1st in milk based products)
It's a french company and a really old one it was found in the 19th century, . They sell b2C but it's fairly recent , they only sold B2B for a really long time thus it's a pretty unknown company if you don't invest in stocks or work in their fields of expertise
I live in Paris now, and a car would actually be a hindrance
I go everything by bike, foot or subway
But I grew up in a village near a small town, where it would have been very hard to live without a car
My parents used to work in another town 50 kilometers away, and it would have been impossible for them
Getting a motor scooter when I was in high school meant a lot of freedom for me, because public transport was very rare and limited, and distances were impractical for a bike
Yup, everyday, not a fan of public transportation, not that there is any here anyway
Used to have a car and sent it to the scrapyard because I never used it
I’m 28, don’t have a driver’s licence nor do I need one
I live in a big city
My mom is 69, she doesn’t have a driver’s licence and has never needed one, despite living in a small town
You can go anywhere you want by taking the bus or train or any public transportation
So yeah, I really don’t plan on ever getting a car
I almost never used my car when living in a city (population > 100k), since public transport is usually good there
Now I live in a more rural place (still have small cities, but it's a lot more spread out), with lot less public transport, and it's a mountainous area so using a bike is not really a solution for everyone
I use my car daily, I don't like it but other solution is to climb 10km with my groceries
Planning on buying an electric bike to go to work though, but a cheap one is not enough for here so I need to think about it
From what I've heard, nonexistent
Depends on the area to be honest
In most big cities it's liveable but yeah, in rural areas you can forget it, you need a car
The Minister came out a few years ago to say that they would not bother repealing this law as it is obviously unconstitutional and is therefore not enforced:
Women are not allowed to "transvestite themselves", i.e wear trousers
You can't (technically) name your pig Napoleon
And also:
\- You are free to write a check on any paper
\- You own below and above
\- You can vote for a dead person (if death occurred just before voting)
\- etc
and we we can't name our pig Napoleon
Seriuosly
By law
A lot of people in Western Europe (including me before looking it up) think Balkan=former Yugoslavia
Balkans are the mountains, right ? Then there is a pretty clear [reason] to exclude the Turkish bit, isn't it ?
I suppose so indeed
Although every mountain ever near the sea necessarily has somewhat of a land before the sea, even a small one
It usually doesn't go from altitude 500+ meters to 0 abruptly
The area is so small I don't think it matters much though
Isn't it Balkans = the mountains with that name ?
That's like saying Alps = Switzerland and ignoring France, Italy and Austria
Ah okok
Grew up in Somme département of France which is infamous for the battle of the Somme
I know a couple of farmers who still find helmets or ordnance from both world wars
The geography is still very obviously damaged with various holes that have been made by artillery fire
[This one is well known and was actually caused by the British digging under a German trench and stacking 35 tonnes of explosives underneath
We even kept a network of original World War I trenches that you can visit
well, i live in a city build by romans, and civilisations where living there before
Because my dad in an archeologist, i can tell you that it's easy to find anything related to the past underground
Corpses, pottery, animals bones, fossils, weapons
You can also find the form of roman villas within actual aerial photos of fields
Many old buildings can be found in less than 4km
As well as the road network
Some roads are being used since the roman era
I live in France and my house is from the 1860's my friend's house is from the 1810's. Jt's quite common in this region bc they are big old farms
In front of my house there is a castle built around the 1000's and that was attacked during the 100 years war
There is multiple castles in that valley (the valley it self isn't very big) that also date back to the 1000's.
Right now I live in Clermont Ferrand and that's also a very old city, maybe a Gaulish settlement (maybe Vercingetorix) and then a Roman settlement that always was inhabited until nowadays
There is an old cathedral, that is often used as a meme
There is also an old wall to protect the city towers ect
So I'd say that if you dig in your garden you probably don't have much chance of finding something interesting, but it can happen
And if you live somewhere interesting you'll definitely find something
History is everywhere here
My parents house has been built around 1780, so even before the French revolution
I litteraly grew up in an evidence of my country's history haha :)
Also, the city I live in for my studies now (30 minuts away from my parents) is one of the most well preserved historical city through Europe
The construction of the cathedral, aka the neuralgic point of the city, started between 1000-1100 and got finished 400 years later, and was the highest building on earth for about 2 centuries
Right in front of this cathedral is a +600 year old building, pretty much as iconic as our majestic Notre-Dame cathedral
There's a traditional restaurant inside now
I can go to both of these buildings in 15 minuts by taking the tram to or 10 minuts if using my bike
I'll let expert try to find out what city I'm living in, it's a very known city and definitely a super well preserved city, plus it's history is insanely well documented
I love in a random town, I just have to look out of my window and I can already see centuries old buildings
So yeah, it's not uncommon
South west of France : the place is littered with old castles and things like that
Many villages still have parts of the old walls here and there
You also find some gallo-roman building but more sparse
We have a roman pool close from my parent's home for example
And a couple of friends live in a 1735 hospital (they rent half of it for almost nothing)
The next village is home to a pre-historic cave where people discovered some tools and things, hence why the prehistoric people are named like the village (Aurignacian)
So pretty dense, all of that is in a 10 kilometer diameter
It's uncomonly packed tho, most random rural areas wont be that packed
Same here when we go te the Atlantic beach
It's full of slowly sinking ancient german forts
That sums up world wars pretty well I would say
Crazy thing I got explained is that the soldiers manning the trenches totally could hear the enemy digging under them but they were not allowed to leave their post so they could only pray that they would be relieved before it blew up so the next guys would be blown up to bits instead of them
I really like to see things from wildly different eras which seems to be harder to find in the US aside from native ruins
Having access to thousands of years of human history without moving that much from my home is an amazing thing
There is so much of them that, blockhaus, the german word for bunker is iirc now in the french dictionary
When i was in primary school (2004-2009), we learn the country of the EU, we had to draw their flag once (i draw the Greek one)
Later-er, in middle school
In History and Geography class (we have both in the same in France, i know it's different for many country in the EU)
We learn their dates of entry, the différents treaties, and the borders of the EU
In High school
We didn't do the Eu much
Because it was already covered for me
But we had to learn the groups and objects of power within the EU
In Middle school and then High school we learn about it (I'm from 1991)
We learnt about EU again and again and again, everytime the same thing
I had indigestion about that
But to be honest I don't remember much
I remember we learnt about how it was form and when (and also what came before: the CECA with germany about coal, etc
) and we had to learn how it worked
We also had to learn with countries were part of it and the date they became members
I remember having to learn the list and dates in the right order and thinking "who care
knowing who were the first and then who is part is enough
". lol
It was a big part or our program and I probably hated it so much became we learnt about it to much and again and again etc
that's why I don't remember much
We don't know about the different EU political parties
99% of the poulation doesn't. I believe it's by willful design
Our politicians have too much to lose being exposed as powerless in the grand scheme of things
Same here
How long did it take you before knowing the difference between the EU Council, the European Council and the Council of Europe ? lol
common, (warning, one word in french)
For the Brevet, it wasn't that hard
I even play the nerd and said the capital of Malta, and Slovenia, to not fall into the easy one
I didn't used it yet but in some cities in France you can download an app, pay for tickets on it and it displays a QR code and a random number you can show to agents
Depend wich city, but here in Nantes I just use the smartphone app, no need for a card
With money, credit card, but most of people will take a Navigo card, it's a subscription that we usually take for years
There is price for every class in society, but it's not that expensive
Fun facts, because it's France and nothing really work, when each year people have to recharge the card, they do it late so there is big queue near train station, and the service doesn't work
(I had to wait 1h30 just for they told me I wasn't having the right paper to prove I was a student, they were only 5 people before me )
I pay 38€ each month with automatic account payment my transport card for région Ile-de-France
De either say cheese or "ouistiti" which means chimpanzee
Yes, but it's more a kids stuff now, most adults say nothing or cheese too
I still prefer ouistiti
It's sillier than cheese, everyone always cracks a little smile :)
I'd guess cheese was first just becomes it makes more sense: you'll notice most of those involve the sound "i" (e in English, but i in French and German among others) because your mouth forms something close to a smile when sounding that
Käse just makes you open your mouth vertically rather than horizontally, if that makes sense, which does not sound as conducive to good photos
Lol we say cheese
Not exactly a follow-up question but :
"You're French ? Great, I love Paris !"
"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ?"
I can't decide if people don't realize that it means "...wanna fuck
", or if they do and don't realize how gross and inappropriate that is
"French
honhon omelotte du fromagel
must be awesome to live in Paris, how it is
"I'm not from Paris and I would hate to live there"
"Oh
but how is living in Paris
Here is my list and my favorite (ironic) awnser to it
Do you like frog legs
Sorry I only eat premium quality Kouign-Amann
Oh yeah I love Eiffel Tower
Ok, good for you
How much do you shower ?
Only when it's full moon, at 19:21, on Mondays and if it's a year with an odd number or if my mom die
Hon, hon I love Le France
Ja, Ja, Ich liebe Amerika (depends on country)
France is so sexy
I have a girlfriend (depends if it's an hot woman or not)
Catholic or Muslim

How are Covid policies on your country
Please don't
I have once been described as "English from France" by a guy in India
I have never felt so insulted in my entire life
The actual answer to that, I think, involves thinking about what makes the place you live in different from most other places, or at least from where your interlocutor is from
So what someone asking this wants to hear is probably something about the snow/climate, the super low pop density if you're not from the cities, the fabled nordic progressivism if they're american, but it also could whatever you, as an individual, think of your country
Ah, t'es belge une fouais
As a French woman, I'd rather be puzzled by it and gently amused at someone having vivid memories of a French class than be sexually propositioned by some rando (and most often than not, really ugly) tourist
Hey you're right that's actually how she is always referred to
Admittedly I have no idea what her real title is
> Flemish Dutch / Belgian Dutch and just Flemish do not mean the same thing
I mean I get this, but this isn't the sort of linguistic detail you'd expect a foreigner to know
In most cases (and in the NL), Flemish/Vlaams is shorthand for "the variety of Dutch which is spoken in Flanders". Also it would be super awkward to call it Vlaamse Nederlands I guess
Then again, not much more than français belge
Let's get fair with american, they also included in France's map Nice (cause funny name) and  burgundy (cause apparently it's the only place with vines)
And of course they know the Eiffel tower most, it's used in their" end of the world movie"s to show the entire word is ending faster than the USA (which have a retired or divorced scientist hero to save them but not us) by making it collapse with lots of drama
>(I dunno why we should laugh saying honhon
It is probably the least used sound to laugh)
When we say *une blague cochone* (erotic joke) or a 'racist' one we laugh with the hon sometimes
Being French I find these two solutions oddly hilarious
I wonder who is going to be the next french politician to face justice, so I know what to respond to
Fallait pas être belge aussi
Exactly
Just like Oriental or African countries have a yellow sky all the time and no green landscape
Nope the entire African continent is a big desert
If they did their research properly they would know the actual background music is the pan flute in the subway
Then again my own research is almost 10 years old, so maybe people playing music in the subway have moved on from pan flutes now
Ah, I was taught religion, politics and unions
From what I've seen (i live there) it's fairly often actually, thought perhaps because I mostly see vlaams in a context where it's being contrasted to "gewoon" Nederlands :p
Tu dis ça parce que t'es jaloux
Yeah they rarely qualify anything as "Belgische" now that i think of it
Even beer,which is usually vlaams or more often just speciaal
Not in my language
It didn't really mean east asia
In my language it means countries like Afganistan, the Emirate or lebanon
Thanks
I didn't know that
I'll be careful now
Here we call western asia the "moyen orient" and the word orient itself is not negative, even a bit positive because it reminds the wonders people who buy them in the past like spices, silk, diamonds etc
It's the same culture difference than with the word race : here it's outdated and taboo, just like "negro" would be
We learn that there is only one human race: homo sapiens while in the US the word meaning is closer to ethnicity
So talking about a race here would mean you consider him/her as an animal
Macron is very good at telling his audience what they need to hear to let a good impression but then it's just paroles, he will make it sounds as a constructive visit, giving hope to people, but then one week later in front of another audience he might say something completely opposite
All politics are doing it but Macron is really a master at it, you should never believe what he says
She looks so young for her age .
Singapore is pretty much at the top of every international ranking (except democracy)
Nothing new then, let's carry on
Good sign that he's a good manipulator
Doesn't make him good anywhere else really
He's just good at that, playing pretend with foreigners
* Largest EEZ
* Most timezones
* Highest number of tourists per year (probably not for 2020 though)
* Highest percentage of electricity produced by nuclear plants
* Apparently, largest producer of duck meat
* Highest number of times the same emperor was exiled to an island
Highest producer of plums (actually the single region of Lorraine produces 80% of the world's plums)
Also the biggest depression rate
Algeria was in the UE (formerly EEC) from 1958 to 1962
Longest border with another country is brazil
History fun fact: the first liberated department in WW2 was
Algeria
Also the biggest French-speaking country is the Congo Democratic Republic with 85 millions inhabitants
Finally the French president is viceroy of Andorra
Canadians be laughing at you right now
Hasn't it also the longest lasting dynasty in the world
Australia you mean (:
Well, OP asked for "wow" facts
I found it hard to believe too when I found out
Well, the DRC has 85 million inhabitants and french is an official language but only 33 million of them are actually french speakers
Well I'm Lorrain so I can only talk for my region but yeah every cool teen drinks this at parties until they get drunk and it's fucking strong (can go up to 50° if you make it yourself)
Not really, but it exists
[It's the overseas territories]
Everything is relatively small
Take the universe as a scale
Not even
The only border between France and Australia is maritime so I don't know what you're referring to if not that
Google est ton ami :)
Il est le tien aussi, quand on veut faire le malin il vaut mieux commencer par s'assurer qu'on a raison
Je suppose que tu parles des vieilles "frontières" imaginaires en Antarctique qui ne sont reconnues par personne et ne sont absolument pas pertinentes dans ce contexte
No mate you can’t do that right before the season of tartiflette, aligot and raclette opens
That’s just fucked up
Turnips and rutabagas, yay :(
Maybe not as much as football but rugby can get pretty heated
No football really is the exception, and it always gets violent
I've never seen rugby fans go wild and it's the second sport here
It doesn't mean people don't care, just that they don't get involved as much
Yeah don't forget Quartararo :)
Fighting with Italy on who gets to cook what
We would be fighting with England to get the best seat at the table, throwing bread crumbs at each other
At some point we would get hit by a big loaf of bread by Germany who also wants our seats
We would then join our bread crumbs into an equally big loaf and shoot it at Germany
After consuming all the bread on the table, we would realise that there was enough room for everyone from the start, had we jus calmed down a little
Eventually we would all get drunk and hug each other
Unfortunately, England was too drunk and leaned backward on her chair a bit too much, got hurt and decided to leave the table
We complain about the food brought by the ithers
Except Italy
And especially Britain
Britain would be telling everyone to F off
Underrated comment there
We'd find it a bit weird as well ourselves though
Though we eat earlier than you do, we'd also find 7PM to be excessively early
Then France would argue that you already admitted the fries were french several month ago and that you should stop drinking too much beers ;)
France would try to flirt with all of the Nordic countries, by being loud and boasting random shit
The Nordics would exchange embarassed looks and try and ignore France, hoping they'd go away and leave them back to their silence
You get with your friends to have a fun evening and all, and then the UK sends you Wales and ask you to "take care of him"
He's retarded
Tsss, apéro first
We'll eat around 11 pm
Bonjour dear
How are you doing in this fine evening ?
Crossing the neighbour’s garden (Belgium)
Those are fighting words
Beside, people don't know what's good for them when it comes to food, you know this
#pineappleonpizza
France would step in and get involved : *"shut your trap England, everyone knows Belgium makes better beers than you !"* And then we'd fight, until we pass out, singing and hugging
No, that's way too early ! People are still at work !
So restaurants will be open for dinner at 16h ?
We have even afford local food anyway so we're all eating Chinese
At work or in transportation
I finish at 15h30 but I start early
Many of my colleagues leave around 18
That's interesting
Here it wouldn't be open this early
France's colonial history in North America is very much glossed over
But then again there's only so much history you can pack in 3 hours per week
The whole 19th century is something that I was not properly taught during my school days
The napoleon wars were briefly spoken about, same for the 1830 and 1848 revolutions, the 1870 war etc
but I don't remember the lessons at all
There was a huge part about the colonies though but it was a chapter that was going from the 19th century to the second half of the 20th
What I learned about the 19th century during my schooldays was mostly coming from the novels we had to read for French classes
Everything regarding Napoleon the Third was swept under the rug, and I find it oh so unfair
The guy ruled the country as a president for two years and then confiscated power to become the new French Emperor for 20 years, and yet school children barely know anything about him
He was a mediocre military chief but he had a hand in the Middle East (our close relationship with countries such as Lebanon starts here), he invaded and controlled what was Indochina and he participated in the Crimea war
He put Paris on a map again by having the first world Fair in the city, and modernised it thanks to Haussmann, a model that will inspire many cities around France
He also created a modern railway system as well as the telegraph
And yet all we remember about him is how he fell for the trap set by Bismarck
The Thirty Years War, and the whole reformation, are not taught
We just say "yeah habsburgs charles v (we don't even know who is he) François Ier and yeah 50 years later there was a massacre in paris and then there was the edict of nantes repelled later by louis xiv and he conquered stuff and then we helped the americans and we had a revolution k bye"
This is basically everything we are taught between 1492 and 1789
Interesting, I was taught about it when we spoke  about the Prussian war
You don't learn about the 100 years war
They got honoured this year by the mayor of Paris, who is herself of Spanish descent
The backstory behind the invasion of Algeria itself would catch the attention of a teenager classroom in my opinion, a pity they don't teach that
Some envoy of the French was presented in front of the Sultan (?) ruling Algiers, insulted him, was received with a gauntlet to the face, obviously
The French man got back to his ships and bombed the shit out of Algiers under that pretext
Oh I see
Sry for the mistake
A remake of the German series "Generation War " seen from the point of view of French youth would be very interesting
Of course the scenario would be different, but the idea would be the same
You don't remake a movie or TV show
Makes me think of americans that made an american version of Intouchables
It's ridiculous and ruins the original movie
[Adults in the room] is a bit like that, it show the negotiation during the  Greece's 2015 financial bailout with the EU,
It's full of contradictions and accommodations with history,  I agree (wehrmacht soldier having a friendship in the open with a jew in 1941, lol)
Nonetheless I found the project interesting, and would be curious to see it adapted to my national history, if the writers were bold enough to address the ugly side of it ( French SS, collaboration, arrests of jews by the French police and so on)
Dubbing sucks too, just use subtitles
No, you're already out
You're thinking of the transition period, that ends in a month
The French government has a list of opinions you're allowed to have
Any illegal opinion is punished with fines and jail time
That we're rude to tourists
We're assholes to everyone really
One of the dumbest things I have read about France and the French language was [this post on /r/explainlikeimfive]
> L'Académie française is a council which dictates the usage (including gender) of new words entering the French language
For example, when the iPhone was released they decided whether the word 'iPhone' was masculine or feminine
They wield such power that the release of the iPhone was delayed in France while they deliberated, even though "the iPhone" would be "l'iPhone" in French, whether it's masculine or feminine
They went with masculine, in case you're wondering
This is pure bullshit and it got 500+ upvotes
That its illegal to take and publish a photo of the Eiffel tower at night
Unless you're precisely selling photos of the eiffel tower, you're gonna be find
Countless videos on this topic, showing an overall lack of knowledge about french law are claiming its illegal
(For instance
Then it's just a game of circular citation
But its not illegal
In most cases you'd be fine
madeleine*
But yeah, people really don't differenciate between the USSR, its satellites and the much more independent communist states like Yugoslavia
This myth has been said about most western european countries though, it's not unique to France
To be fair, I'd trust the government over corporations to have access to security tapes
*anti-gay propaganda
Sounds healthy
Oh, the pharmaceutical industry is going alright in the US, not denying that
And yes, I'm sure you can get great treatment if you're rich, certainly
Some of these other claims I'm not so sure about, but none of them are relevant to the matter at hand, which is that "just don't pay, you'll worry about the consequences later" is not the result of a healthy system
Me not liking it is quite inconsequential
You (and a significant portion of your fellow citizens) defending it is the problem, but one that really only affects US citizens, so please do continue
The privilege of democratic societies is to make their own terrible decisions
Quite recently, Camille Kouchner, the daughter of Bernard Kouchner (founder of [MSF] ) published a book relating how her famous politologist stepdad Olivier Duhamel used to have incestuous relations with his stepson (Camille's brother)
The case take place in a very closed intellectual-bourgeois environnement in 80's Paris and unfolded a whole horror-story revelations
*Just transcribing what I understood from media, for more infos here is an [article] (in French)*
On that topic I’d go with D. Cohn Bendit
He will never outlive the memory of some of the things he told in interviews, among which is the famous sentence: "it’s fantastic when a young girl, a 5 year old, starts to undress you, because it’s something of an erotica-manic game
” He told that one on TV in 1982, so it’s well recorded, and he became a politician so of course it came in the news at some point & was a scandal
I'd give it to DSK rape in NY + link to "Dede la saumure" who is not only a pimp, but a pimp of the "underage" kind
Or the whole contaminated blood thing, which is totally bonkers
The stepson was still a child, and could therefore not give consent
I’m also surprised to see it called incest, especially since the abuser is the _step_father (of course there are awesome stepfathers out there, but do the children really see him as a paternal figure of sorts after the abuse
I somehow doubt it)
Yeah and it's about love fading away in a lasting relationship
It's very common in France
There are themed ones, general ones etc
There are usually all sorts of schemes for kids from less privileged backgrounds to go, like vouchers from the social services or from company unions
I once went to a paleontology-themed camp where only another kid and myself had parents paying for it out of pocket
Everyone else had parents working for the same company working with a selection of camps
It's pretty much my favourite place on Reddit, everyone is just super chill and informative
Best Ask sub ever !
In France I’d say once a year but now we can’t anymore do cleaning because of the covid
I hardly go, not because of the cost but because dentist are not trusted here
I last went 6 years ago
This was a new doctor because I had move in a new neighbourhood
Not only she was patronising but it seemed that she was trying to 'find' cavities (Dentists here have always suspected of 'finding' cavities that just don't exist)
I didn't go again
I always heard that you should go once every two years
I don't really have teeth issues, so last time I went was 3 years ago
I absolutely don't get what people would go several time a year if there is no health issues
> who are talking about “cleaning”, which is done by a dental assistant, not a dentist
Well not in France
It is the dentist that does it here generally
Maybe it depends on why you go
To do cleaning, my dentist said it should be once or twice a year (but again maybe it depends on people)
I usually don't go if I don't have issues
I learned about it during the chapter with the revolutions of 1848
The worst thing is we lerant about Poland partition, we are told about Stanislas Leszczynski (who was Louis XV's father-in-law), but but I've never heard of PLC in school
And the worst thing is that we don't learn anything about this war in France, even though we fought there (few soldiers, logistical support plus training I think)
History without Belgium ?
(Sorry couldn't resist)
Thats true if you have 1 salary for 3 people
If both parents work it's more than good
Damn how is the software dev market in Finland ?
I'm mostly a Java/JS dev with some knowledge (but no work exp) in React and Angular, 3 years of experience
What would typically be the wage for someone like me ? I hover around 2700€ before taxes where I live
I don't live in Paris, thankfully
It'd cost me about twice as much to live there
But thanks for the link
About 700k inhabitants in my city, but the avg wage in France is quite low anywhere else than Paris
The death penalty was abolished in August 1981 in France, under François Mitterrand, despite more than 60% of the population who wanted to keep it in place
The last person who was executed by Guillotine was in 1977
A minority of people today are in favor of a return to the death penalty, mainly people on the far-right
Better to have no death penalty than to run the risk of killing an innocent
That's not true, [a lot of people want it back]
The head would fall in a basket, although I imagine litres of spilled blood would have to be mopped, indeed
Gross
Still, I would choose the Guillotine over any kind of other method if I had to be sentenced to death
It's quick and painless (it was invented for that reason)
Problem is, by killing a murderer you create another one
So you can't keep up in terms of moral high ground : killing is bad but killing a murderer is good ?
Still a lot more than just the far right
Despite what a lot of french people, would say, France is pretty welcoming for immigrants, especially Paris, which is extremly multicultural
We are pretty welcoming if you try to adapt and we’ll be very happy to see you try to speak French
You’ll see many people answering you in English (even though you spoke French) just to help or even just for us to practice
We honestly like American people (but most don’t like the capitalistic culture of your country haha remember that Biden is pretty much right wing for us), and you’ll be even more accepted in cities
Integration is sometimes harder for some culture and some color of skins, sometimes
It’s sometimes harder to be black and/or Arab (darker skin) mostly when you are in the countryside and people vote in majority for Marine Le Pen
I don’t think that’s the majority and I think we are mainly welcoming (even more in the cities outside of Paris) !
No, but if I took the previous week off it would only count for 4 days instead of 5
That's not for everyone, depends on how your company counts business days I think
I don't really understand,  but I'm not going to complain
Works the same for other public holidays, I'm using that this week since next Saturday is also a holiday here
Not in France
unfortunately no, only the 1st is a day off :/
Nope
1st of May is a holiday and only the 1st of May
There are already 4 holidays in May here, so we don't really need more haha
also in France the 8th is a day off too, and it's on saturday too
And in france we have the 8th of May, so our loss too
I cross the border to bathe abroad, I never bathe in my country
Once a day, twice a day during the hotest moments of summer or when I was living on the ecuator
I shower twice a day, one cold shower to wake up and a warm shower to go to bed
I don't know how common it is but I think most French people only shower once a day
Daily, more than that when reaching heat peaks in the holidays but this is likely not that widespread
I shower everyday but take baths only once every two months
Usually once a day
Sometimes twice a day during summer
Less during covid if I'm not going out
Yep
I guess if you have a pizza cutter that's better, but scissors are more efficient than knives I find
I always used a large knife or occasionally a pizza cutter though I never owned one of those
One day I saw my sister cutting pizza with scissors and I was *appalled*. Honestly, it looked shocking to me
and then I tried it
100%a convert now
I used scissors in front of my dad, a professional chef, recently and you should have seen his reaction
He imploded and was so mad tha I desecrated both my meal and his kitchen scissors like that
I never saw anyone cutting pizza with scissors tbh
Shitty supermarket/chain pizza
I could, yes
Actual, respectable pizza
Never
HERESY ! Pizza deserves to be treated with respect !
I personally use scissors because scissors are versatile, while this inox sharp wheel is a bit limited in use beside cutting a pizza
So, one accesory less in my kitchen
I have no idea if my personal case is the norm in France though
Cutting a pizza with a pizza cutter is not that hard
Here's a [tutorial] on how to cut a pizza into ten err
eight slices
I prefer knives (and pizza cutters), but I’ve seen people use scissors
Not rare, but not the rule
Never seen it be used, I have a pizza cutter, otherwise a knife and fork will do
But if scissors are your weapon of choice I see no problem with it as long as it gets the job done
People from Alsace often joke and look down on my region, Lorraine, and people in Lorraine often joke about Alsace
It’s mostly for old bickering
Paris maybe
Every parisian joke about provinciaux (those who don't live in Paris) and provinciaux joke about parisians
In France, people shit on Paris
But really, you can call every single region trash and people will agree with you
Why ? Because most of the time it's either true or people don't know the region well enough to have an opinion
Also the departement Creuse is looked as one of the most rural places in France, and it's where half of my family comes from (and yeah it's rural af)
I'm from Normandy /Brittany (and there is also a lot of old bickering there, as between Brittany and Paris, or Brittany and every authority figure really)
But I think the regions which are the most laughed at are the 'Nord-Pas-de-Calais' and Marseille area, mostly because both have very distinctive regional accents so they are easy to imitate and parody
To be honest, French people in general love mocking others, whether they be French from other regions or foreigners
So it's more "what region of France do we not make fun of". And the answer is
none
Especially as a Parisian
I live in the middle of nowhere, which means that I joke on Parisians mostly, and people who live in even "shittier" place than where I live
Hans don’t start
I can’t stand Scouse or Brummie accents and sort of held that against the cities themselves
until I properly visited
Brum was great and I made a lot of friends but my biggest surprise was how beautiful Liverpool is
True "Parisians" (born and bred) are quite rare tbh, most Parisians are "banlieusards", that means actually from the Parisian suburbs or the Île-de-France region (10 million people live in the Parisian urban area, against 2 million in Paris proper), and a lot of Paris residents are not originally from the city
The Parisian urban area is huge
1 in 6 people in France come from Paris or its urban area
People from the Parisian suburbs mostly consider themselves to be Parisian and will mostly be considered Parisians outside of the Paris region
People from Paris proper however, regardless of whether they are actually from Paris or just moved there, are very perseverent on the fact that the Paris suburbs ("Paris extra-muros") are not really the city of Paris ("Paris intra-muros"), therefore according to them people from the suburbs are not real Parisians
So, it's a bit complicated because of the quite peculiar administrative and urbanistic situation of Paris, which, contrary to other big cities such as London or Berlin, has kept itself isolated from its suburbs
But let's just say that it doesn't really play a role whether you are actually from Paris or whether you have moved there
For outsiders you will be a Parisian
For people living in Paris proper, only people living within the actual city borders are Parisians, the others will be "banlieusards".
If you move to Paris, Provinciaux will immediately see you as a Parisian and will joke about it
But Parisian will not necessarily see you as a Parisian immediately
Same in the other way
Yes, many people in Germany tend to look down on Berlin
But, usually not because they are seen as arrogant or snobbish, actually quite on the contrary
The "petty bourgeois" mindset is quite widespread in Germany and many people see the capital as dirty, poor, dangerous and unorderly
They seem to have issues with completing public works on time (such as the airport), drugs and criminality, they are seen as a party destination for lazy youngsters from all around the world
I would say, actually those feelings do not differ too much from other Western European countries
Usually, people from outside their nation's capital tend to despise it
Only, in Germany it is quite a recent feeling
As Berlin has been (again) the nation's capital for 30 years only
Plus, it was a divided and occupied city and people didn't have it in high regards in West Germany before reunification (it was seen as a city for draft-dodgers, punks and other outsiders and dropouts)
Berlin is probably in the course of becoming a city on par with Paris, London or Madrid, but it will take some time
However, I don't think Germans will ever "love" their capital city
Just as people from France usually hate Paris and people from the UK usually hate London
You mean Paris
Lol, would you mind forwarding a link from a scene dubbed in German ? Not that I speak any German anyway but I'm curious about hearing "German Ch'ti".
Danke, very peculiar accent indeed !
Strangely no
Lollywood
There is the [”Cité du cinéma”] created by Luc Besson
It's quite new so it's not iconic yet, but it seems promising
It really isn't. The Festival is there because the Côte d'Azur is an attractive place to hold a festival, and the city invested a lot of money into it, but the industry is mostly based around Paris
The biggest French city is our capital Paris
It's a strange city as it's the most populated of the country, but it is rather small size wise
Which makes it one of the most dense city in the world
To compare with another European capital, let's take London, Paris has roughly 2
2 million citizen for a surface area of 105 Km² (10 540 hectares)
Which makes 20 000 citizen by square kilometre
London on the other hand has a population of 8
9 million citizen living in a city for a surface area of 1572 km² (157 200 hectares), which gives us a density of 5667 citizen by square kilometre
Now let's compare Paris to the 2nd biggest French city: Marseille
The phocean city is way bigger than Paris with a surface area of 240 Km², making it the 2nd larger French city behind Arles (758 Km²)
Now Marseille has 861 635 inhabitants
You really cannot imagine more different cities than Paris and Marseille
The size, the architecture, the people, the weather
It's just day and night
Interestingly, even though Marseille is way bigger than Paris, it's transport city is smaller and of less quality
Life there is a more Mediterranean one
People are more open too
The city is unfortunately known for its criminality issues
Which isn't really deserved
Marseille isn't worst than Paris or it suburb, but media talk about it more so in most people's mind Marseille = criminality and drug
The 3rs biggest French city is Lyon
Another completely different kind of city
Lyon is mostly famous for being the city of the Brothers Lumière, the inventors of cinema, as well as its gastronomy
One again its architecture is different from the last two
Which is refreshing
If Paris is known for la Seine, Lyon is being cross by two rivers: le Rhône and la Saône
It has a surface area of 47 Km² with 513 275 citizens
It's only a detail, but I really love its many bridges
As the city is being crossed by two rivers, a lot of different bridges with different architectures are spread around the city
Most are lighted during the night and they're all very beautiful and charming
I've had the chance to visit both those cities and live in two of them
They actually are my 3 favourite French cities I've been
I couldn't rank them
They all have their pros and cons
Paris is kinda cliché but I can't help it, I love it
I've been living in Parisian region for 3 years now since I study there, and it's just really great
You can find everything you want
Food, culture etc
Marseille will always have a special place in my heart
It's where we went in holidays when I was a child
Plus it's the south of France and it really is a different way of living compared to Northern France
I wouldn't recommend living in the city itself, bunch of great smaller towns around it, but going there during the weekend is always great
As for Lyon, it's the city closest to where I grew up, an hour ride
My sister lives there and most of my high school friends studiy there
It's the one I know the least, but damn do I love it
I'm in film school and I love its history with cinema
I love its vibe
It's not a northern city nor is it a southern one
It's a good in-between imo
It's the one I would recommend living intra-muros the most
It's also the birthplace of the French Tacos and every French perso that ever had the munchies after drinking too much owe Lyon their salvation
Sorry, I know it was long guys
I'll just end this by saying:
69 la trik
C'est pas la capitale, c'est Marseille bébé.
Paris, Paris, on t'encule
Edit: I'm stupid and shouldn't write anything after midnight
Edit 2: ok ok sorry everyone for comparing Paris and London
I apologise
I just knew that "officially" London was bigger and less dense and thought it'd be a nice insight of the French capital density and hence way of life
- Paris (2,2M *intra muros* - 12M including the suburbs)
Lots of tourists and full of arrogant people
Strangers love it, French people hate it
- Marseille (860k - 1,6M)
Relatively cool city, it's the complete opposite of Paris except for the suburbs
Both have high criminality rates
- Lyon (500k - 1,7M)
Nice city next to the Alps
It's more calm
You should use the urban area to compare London & Paris
Paris’ official city limits are very restricted compared to similar cities in other countries
Plus Lyon has the perfect situation to escape by car:
Want high mountain
Alps ski stations are at 3 h
Want small mountain country side with cute town
Auvergne is only 3 hours
Want provence style and mediteranean beaches
only 3
5 hours
Want Geneva
2hours
Want the Loire Chateaux: 4 hours
Want cute germanic style timbered houses
Colmar is at 4hours
Want a weekend in Italie
Turino at 3
5 hours
And by train Paris is only 2hours
If a French sang this we'll cheer
Unfortunately for you an albionnais has no right to insult our capital
Be happy that we tolerate your presence when we're in Deauville
Don't pousse le bouchon a little trop loin Maurice
Let say both are wonderful and Marseille suck
lol
For an afternoon yes, but for a weekend or 3 days trip, not that much
Damn I was close\^\^ thanks for the info
> and Marseille suck
Une cave
Une chaise
À poil
Don't worry, I've never been there but I was joking, I have nothing personally against it, accept that they are annoying when they say "we have the sun": it's not the most sunny place in france and I hate sun\^\^ 4 days of rain would had been perfect for me §
In France, 11 Vaccines are mandatory
Only some are optional, such as seasonal flu
It is mainly "reeeeee le gouvernement".
But it's also for the usual reasons:
- why do you want to inject something in my kid
- vaccines cause autism
- they contain mercury, mercury is toxic, checkmate
- a friend of a friend of a friend got the shot and now (s)he's sick
Read [this] if you want
To sum up :
* We generally tend not to like our government
* Servier, one of our main pharma companies, has been under fire for the last ten years
Some of their products have caused deaths, and they covered up the facts and lobbied the watchdog authority to stop them from pulling it off the shelves
Now that it's out in the open, trust in pharmaceutical companies has dropped sharply
* The (then-)government tried a PR stunt back in 2009 during an influenza pandemic, which backfired
Basically, we were first told that the epidemic was caused by a different strain of influenza (H1N1) against which the usual vaccine wasn't efficient, then, a few weeks later, we were told that our always super duper effective government conjured millions of H1N1-vaccines out of thin air
After buying these, they pushed much too hard to try to peddle them - basically airing melodramatic PSAs on TV all day long
I think most people - myself included - were really skeptical about their ability to develop a new vaccine in a handful of weeks, so while we weren't, before, scared of our good old measles vaccine, we became, then, anxious
We do ?
William the Conqueror is known here as Guillaume le Conquérant
But Prince William in France, is known as Prince William
Go figure
We write putin "poutine", otherwise the pronunciation would be very different :) .
Yes we do
The current pope is called François
Seems we've stopped translating, back in the days we would say l' Empereur Charles Quint (Emperor Charles V) or Louis II de Bavière, but the previous king of Spain is Juan Carlos and not Jean-Charles
Thanks for the tips
Guillaume, **le** bâtard de Normandie, please
We would have called him  Jean Charles d'Espagne, as we say Louis II de Baviere, so that might have narrowed it a bit, or le roi Jean Charles, which could also have helped, lol
It also spells it **Wilgelm** in some places, but maybe that's a declention of sort
As a South American, I absolutely loved the Balkans
I mean it's nice and all but I felt like I did pretty much all the nice places in a day
It was really nice but rather short
It's not stereotyped as bad at all
Lived there for six months after having basically no opinion on it
I loved it, it's in my top 3 cities easily
What are the common workplace tradition where you live
For example, in France, where food is allegedly a big thing, people bring the breakfast at work on a lot of occasions: every friday morning, when you get a promotion, when you retire, when a big thing happened in your life (marriage, first children), when you come back from a long period of illness,...
Oh, the coffee break is also a tradition in France
When I did my first work placement, they were a bit offended that I didn't took my coffee with all of them
In my current company, viennoiseries are technically forbidden due to COVID
Yet, the whole administrative crew allow themselves to have them every friday (there's even some beef between the first floor and the second floor because someone always store the break table (a small table) on the first floor due to COVID, yet the second floor table haven't moved and people are still eating and taking their coffee break there)
I  guess the reason why we have to bring things for our birthday is for 2 reasons:
I won't pay for Gégé's birthday, the dude has been an asshole for the whole year and works like half a man
I don't know Gégé's birthday anyway
Apply that to a company scale and you get the idea why you have to bring food for your birthday
Because nobody will complain to pay for you nor will have to remember your birthday
Oh, that's neet
The only few time I had beer at work was at a summer job where we could drink a beer during the lunch break, we also sometimes had a cooler with beers in it (but it wasn't allowed to drink on the job), and like three time in 2 month, our boss paid his round (IIRC, it was an agreement with the place's pub where they would do it for free)
Oh, it struck me that la bise is not twice everywhere
My GF's family is from Swizerlands and the surrounding of Lyon, they do la bise thrice and the first time I met them, it was an embarassing experience for all of us
But yeah, la bise is too damn long
at least, where I work, it's okay to just wave and say "salut" or "bonjour". Especially in COVID times
Well, sure he have, but all year round, you will have free pastries
That's a good for an evil if you ask me
How is that so pricey
Like, I can consider that in some asian countries, where there is a great demand and maybe a lack of bakers or of experience in the pain au chocolat field, you could have prices that high
But I would have thought that Swizerland have quite a lot of experience and bakers in the domain, as it's between France and Austria, and have its fair amount of pastries
Also, is the [suisse] a swiss pastry
Or is it just about branding
Because if that's swiss, I'd guess it might be cheaper than the pain au chocolat, and it's way better anyway
Wow
IDK if you're aware of the french cliché about the swiss which is that swiss people are slow
I always thought that it comes from the cliché Jura's accent which is just elongating the stressed syllable and lowering your voice (Donc ça sonne un peu comme çaaa)
But that wouldn't surprise me if that also comes from the way you greet each other aswell
But that seems indeed like a very long way of greeting each other indeed
The worst is that Lyon has the best number 69, he had the opportunity and didn't even take it
>How is that so pricey
It's Switzerland, everything is expensive
Yeah, I know, I went in Jura, I heard more people there talk with the allegedly swiss accent than when I went in swizerland
[Les Litanies de Satan - Rotting Christ]
The band is from Greece, but the song is in perfect French
The lyrics are taken from Charles Baudelaire's poem *Les Litanies de Satan
&#x200B;
[Dans Le Noir, Je Vois Rouge - Le Rouge et le Noir ; l'Opéra Rock]
Song from a French musical that is inspired by Stendhal's novel *The Red and The Black
&#x200B;
[Percées De Lumière - Alcest]
French band, pioneer of the blackgaze genre
Rock and metal are cool but have you listen some [french-celtic rap from the 90'] with bagpipe ?
In french alternative rock, influenced by guinguette (popular etablishment from the XIX and XX centiries) and Mediterranean music, i really enjoy [Les Negresses vertes]  (*the green niggers*, the name may triggers some people here but it is approved in France)
Of course it's french so there is an accordion
Charle VI the mad, literally suffered from schizophrenia and almost lost the Hundred Year War
Charles VI, "Le fol" (the fool), quite litteraly
Actually he probably suffered from epilleptic episodes due to inbreeding
His father almost ended the 100 years war by 1400 but Charles the 6th psychical weakness allowed the english to strike back by allying with Charles' wife and forcing him to give the throne to a english kid
Louis X the Hutin, who produced nothing but shit, and only whined and screamed all his life, without ever accomplishing anything
Okay, he died five days after he was born, but he could have made an effort
Charles VI almost made France lose the 100 years war because of his madness
Robespierre is a big contenders too
It's likely that England would have been Scottified by France had your kings won the war
Yeah i'd think of him first
I don't think Robespierre was mad
Even historians are pretty conflicted about Robespierre actual role in the Terror, while agreeing that he certainly had one
A lot of elements seem to point at him being the scapegoat of the worst culprits who blamed him for everything after the fact to make sure they did not get accused of anything themselves
Among the people who engineered the arrest and execution of Robespierre you find many people who were actually known for sure to have been on the field overseeing the worst of the Terror at a local level, most of the time in a very enthusiastic way
Robespierre was responsible for taking most of them out of the field by recalling them in Paris, probably in attempt to curb the bloody repressions that happened at a local level
It is very likely that the Terror was by and large the result of the actions of many men more than an actual system organized from the top
Robespierre was also a staunch abolitionist
Well that's absolutism 101
Same in French really
I'm guessing English forgot about the other definition of "terrible" which they had copied from us
[Affaire Dreyfus] is the most famous judicial saga France ever had
Almost 130 years later it is in every French history book when it comes to late XIXth century
> The scandal began in December 1894 when Captain Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of treason
Dreyfus was a 35-year-old Alsatian French artillery officer of Jewish descent
He was sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris, and was imprisoned in Devil's Island in French Guiana, where he spent nearly five years
> In 1896, evidence came to light—primarily through an investigation instigated by Georges Picquart, head of counter-espionage—which identified the real culprit as a French Army major named Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy
When high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after a trial lasting only two days
The Army laid additional charges against Dreyfus, based on forged documents
Subsequently, Émile Zola's open letter J'Accuse…!, stoked a growing movement of support for Dreyfus, putting pressure on the government to reopen the case
> In 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial
The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called "Dreyfusards"), such as Sarah Bernhardt, Anatole France, Henri Poincaré and Georges Clemenceau, and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as Édouard Drumont, the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole
The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was pardoned and released
In 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army
He served during the whole of World War I, ending his service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel
He died in 1935
> The affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France into pro-republican, anticlerical Dreyfusards and pro-Army, mostly Catholic "anti-Dreyfusards". It embittered French politics and encouraged radicalisation
Other famous judicial cases include :
- Trials of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette in 1791 and 1793
- Trial of Joan of Arc, national hero of the Hundred Years War and catholic saint, for witchcraft (or heresy, can't remember)
Though technically that would be an English  trial
- Trial of famed French novelist Gustave Flaubert in 1856 for writing an immoral novel about a cheating woman
The novel is often studied in school nowadays as a litterature classic
- Trial of Charlotte Corday in 1793 for the murder of Jean-Paul Marat, revolutionary figurehead during the Reign of Terror
- Trial of Pierre Calas, famous because it lead to the Treatise on Tolerance by famed philosopher Voltaire in 1763 about religious toleration and against religious fanaticism
The book is still a good sale 250 years later and a foundation stone for French secularism
- Trial of Giuseppe Fieschi for regicide attempt to draw France in a war against Italy in 1835
- Trial of François Ravaillac for successful regicide in a context of religious civil war in 1610
- Trial of Nicolas Fouquet, successful finance minister who tried to shine brighter than the Sun King in 1661
I would have expected that trial where you executed your king before it was cool and that one where you burnt a teenager girl for leading armies against you and overall kicking (your) ass
Since they're in your history books
Yeah and he was an absolute nobody back then, it was his first book
The trial gave him a massive advertising
Former president of the parliament defend an unknown author in a trial for indecent novel
What a headline
The book was hot fire
The carriage scene was straight hardcore porn for the time
The crime was outrage to public morality and religion
Flaubert was cleared
The same public prosecutor would later go after Beaudelaire for his poems, and this time won (he got around 3000€ fine and 6 poems were censured out of Fleurs du Mal to keep the publication)
I would have expected the Hundred Years War to be in the curriculum, I'm a bit disappointed
The build up over centuries and crusades is pretty interesting and the aftermath on your end was the War of the Roses :(
Fair enough
Since the title said famous in your country
I expected cases in history books to be more famous than cases in law textbooks
But both Charles I and Joan of Arc had a (parody of) trial
They weren't (too) summarily executed
So I counted it as trials every kid learned about at some point
It's just that those court cases have little interest as precedent nowadays and are more interesting to historians than lawyers
It was fuck long ago
Still would like to see a modern case with a lawyer going ballsy and using one of those however :D but it's never going to happen
Could be fun to imagine a legit but weird case where they would fit
I know that in Luxembourg you can visit a museum about banks
I know that Belgium has a lot of issues with their language conflicts, and that everybody allows forgets about their Germans
I know that Antwerp used to be the diamond capital of the world and still has one of the biggest commercial harbors of the world
I know that a lot of great Belgian francophones artists are thought to be French even by the French
(same for comics, la BD belge)
I know that the more north you go the more they love fried things in Benelux
I know that Dutch people are nice but very smug and somehow more scandinavian than germanic in their culture (imo)
I know that Dutch engineering and their dykes is absolutely amazing
I know that both are monarchies and that the Netherlands celebrate theirs with Orange Day
I know that the Netherlands has Friesland which is a region with its own language and cultural peculiarities
Quite a lot about wallonia and some things about the Netherlands and their history but not more
In french we can just say "merci".
But we also use a lot:
Merci à toi: "thank to you" when you are talking to one person, informal way
Merci à vous: "thank to you" when you are talking to one person, formal way or to several people, formal or informal way
If you want to make it clear that you are talking to everyone and not one person in a formal way you can say "merci à tous" or "merci à vous tous" => thank you all
They are a little bit more formal
They also allow the speaker to thank on the behalf of other people since it literally means "I thank you", hence you can change the subject to "nous" (we) if needed
Didn't know that
Expected UK, West Germany, Israel and a bunch of other countries to rank before
Another surprising fact, by the end of WW2, Canada had the 3rd biggest fleet in the world, essentially escort ships for the battle of the Atlantic
Fench, Italian and Japanese fleet got destroyed or captured for various reasons
Not books but authors that you'll certainly encounter if you're French : Hugo, Zola, Maupassant, Molière, Voltaire, Beaudelaire, La Fontaine, Shakespeare are the most studied I think
Also Rousseau, Camus, Stendhal, Apollinaire, Racine, Corneille, Rimbaud, Balzac, Flaubert, Dumas, Verne, Vian
Stories of the Middle Ages : Perceval or the Story of the Grail, Tristan and Iseult
And maybe some other foreigners' books like To Kill A Mockingbird, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Don Quixote, Divine Comedy, Pride and Prejudice, Oliver Twist, Anne Frank's Diary
Always the same few classical books from Voltaire, Rousseau, Zola, Camus, Molière, Maupassant
Almost never modern author (I had one in my entire scolarity), almost never exited one like Jules Vernes or Victor Hugo
Never or extremly rarely women (We only hear about George Sand but I had never study it)
For peosie: always Jean de la Fontaine in primary school (we had to learn one by hearth every week and tell it in front of all the group on friday) and later mostly Beaudelaire, a few other classical
Never foreign one
"La Princesse de Clèves" et "Le Rouge et le Noir" gave me nightmares
Can you list some Ukrainian classics please, I'm very interested
I never read La Princesse de Clèves, I quitted after 50 pages
I also disliked La Princesse de Montpensier, but at list it's short
Can't be worse than Madame Bovary
Having to read Madame Bovary is the most boring thing I've ever endured
Every page was a challenge
It's quite rare to read it entirely actually
Usually we study extracts
I remember studying the circles of hell
Also, we have some books who are mandatory but the teachers can choose for others, so maybe other French people didn't study it
It's because Proust style is very particular and quite hard to read, his speciality is "l'hyperhypotaxe" which means that his sentences are very, very, very long
Therefore, it's not really suitable to read or study in school, we may work on some important part of the book, but almost never on the entire story
Oh I also had to read that one
Guess my mind tried its best to delete it from my memory
Oh dear, thank you thank you thank you
The list is perfect, the illustrations are really something, and I so look forward to looking these up
And about poor villagers and serfdom
I've not read too much on it, but it seems like an intriguing subject now
Yes, I enjoyed it
I also did more researches about the book and Dante
If I have the time, I will buy it and read it entirely :) I'm also learning Italian at school so I would love to read it in Italian but it's gonna be difficult - -'
A funny one in French is Vasistas, comes from the german phrase "Wass ist dass ". It discribe a small window
Ersatz
Sorry, my german is a little rusty ! Yes it's "was ist das" "qu'est-ce que c'est". Wich itself could be transmated back in german as "was ist das was dies ist"
Ich habe Deutsch gelernt, aber alles vergessen !
Well, not super common but it trended again a few years back, because Zlatan, man buns, et all
Here's an [illustration] of what you also can expect
People are okay, except maybe for work environnements in which you're expected to comply, like trading
"Your Hair doesn't look german" had me giggling
I have also been told I don't look French on multiple occasions by people with very precise ideas about how French people should look like
I imagine it is even worse for Germans who don't fit the tall blonde stereotype prevalent in the Anglo-sphere
Thats definitly not the kind of long-hairstyle you will see most of time
> We’re no elves goddammit
I refuse to admit that
My experience too
Never felt people in Germany were "lighter" there than France
The UK, however, definitely fairer
Have not had the opportunity to visit Finland yet
*Mante* is the French word for mantis
The praying mantis is called *mante religieuse*, religious mantis (I think it is called "religious mantis" in all Romance languages)
Ah, I knew how it was called in Italian & Romanian and thought it was a Romance thing
Well, TIL, obrigado
You've been banned from the Romance languages gang
>No, because it's the literal translation of the scientific name
Ok but the scientific name is this because it looks like she's praying
Internationally, I'd say La vie en rose for "traditional" songs
For more recent stuff, probably anything by Daft Punk
Here in France, the following ones are really famous
Many have been translated into other languages and used by different political groups
1) [L'Internationale] , written in 1871 during the Paris Commune
2) [La Carmagnole] written during the French Revolution
3) [Le Chant des Partisans] written during the Second World War
4) [Le Chant du départ] written during the French Revolution
5) [Le Temps des cerises] written during the Paris Commune
6) [Verdun, on ne passe pas] written during the First World War
Nowadays, anything of :
David Guetta (Bad, Hey Mama, Titanium, She Wolf, Shot Me Down),
DJ Snake (Turn Down for What, Lean On, Taki Taki, Magenta Riddim)
and Daft Punk (Get Lucky, Harder Better Faster Stronger, One More Time)
For older stuff : "Aux Champs-Élysées" by Joe Dassin, "La vie en rose" by Edith Piaf
Take on me is Norwegian
Damn I love your country more now
I'd say rather "ich hab Stoff und Schaps" even though it's originally Dutch the German version is more known and I know that's not something the Germans are proud of
[Douce France too]
The post asked for song that aren't the national anthem
David Guetta is French too but he also took the American nationality
DJ Snake is French as well
Internationally I'm not so sure
Who's that
I didn’t know they were that famous in the US they are not that famous in France tbh
Even Daft Punk could be more famous in France ! Justice also
Really the guys from Justice can walk peacefully in Paris, I’ve seen them haha
One of my favorite pieces of "classical" music
The singer from Phoenix is friends with Daft Punk ! It’s a French alternative band
Actually they all started in the same band named Darlin’. And a British journalist said they sounded like some kind of daft punk and got some pretty bad reviews
So they ended Darlin’. Then they discovered electronic music by attending at raves and Thomas and Guy-Manuel from Daft Punk thought it would be a cool name for the electronic duo
Blocked in France, thanks Youtube (: anyway I've never heard about them so they may be big in their genre but they're probably not as big as Daft Punk, at least here
That’s kind of funny since justice doesn’t sound like the mainstream edm like Tomorrowland kind of things
Actually when they released “Dance” it was everywhere so that went almost “pop music” for a second (and it’s still pretty popular)
They are still pretty underground doing their own thing and it feels good like this
BUT they won a Grammy for their last live album so it’s not that underground
The style is underground but it’s so good I gets to the mainstream audience
Just like daft punk doing their own thing
It feels good to see artists getting real recognition by not following the mainstream recipe
Baguette hon hon omelette du fromage oui oui monsieur très joli le tour eiffel le fromage voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? (background accordion music)
It always surrenders
Honhonhon, le surrender, Honhonhon
Oh la la béret camembert mon ami
People actually say that
I feel you bro
Wow
I don't know if I'm more amazed, offended or entertained
C'est bon arrête
Not funny
Well shit man the only dutch guy I know is a crackhead
Women who slept with Germans were shaved in public, anyone who collaborated and was captured by resistance was generally given a bullet to the head or was hanged
Oooh, we have a very uncomfortable relationship with that part of our past
There was no blood bath after France was liberated, however many were beaten or killed and thousands of [women were shaved and publicly exposed] before a more fair system of justice courts was set up to give all those people (but mostly high ranking officers) some kind of a trial
Still, an estimated 9000 people were executed or killed before the some semblance of a justice system was set up
Many high ranking party however officers escaped their judgement or got really reduced sentences in the end because in the years after the war people wanted to "move on" and not dwell on those horrible years
Politics wanted to have France united again
The issue also was "how do we even set the limit between what actually was active or passive collaboration"?
I think the culmination of this internal debate was the trial of ex-Maréchal Pétain (leader of occupied France)
Pétain actively collaborated with Nazi Germany and helped to get countless French jews arrested and deported, but he was a WW1 hero and quite ill by the time of his trial
Initally he was supposed to be executed, however the court sentenced him to life in prison
He died imprisoned and senile in 1951
[There's a good article on the French Wikipedia about the whole process
Women had their head shaven and were shamed in the streets (shamed is a very loose term, sometimes these women were beaten, and even raped, in the most extreme cases)
Those that fought for the Germans (usually anti-communists) kept their mouth shut about it, it actually affected our society a lot because these men grew up very resentful of Germany and of the things they had seen and committed
As for government members, the main ones were put on trial, sometimes executed, sometimes prison for life, sometimes just locked up for a bit
Then, CDG especially, fought to get rid of collaborators who had made their way in the provisional government and later the government of the 4th republic
Some collaborators  even committed atrocities in Algeria, or against Algerians in France, before later being found of collaborating with the NAZI's and being put on trial
So, in government it was a long struggle to purge our offices of those that had commited treason against our country, while on the streets it was mostly women who were punished and shamed
Collaborators were condemned to death , and women who had sex with nazi soldiers or officers were shaved ( i'm talking about hair you pervert )
There were also proper trials, people sentenced to death, prison, etc
Especially Pétain, head of state who was imprisoned in a military fort till the end of his life
But
some of them got away with it and went on pursuing their career happily
*accused of
Quite a few accounts were settled in that way
Interesting, I didn't know about this part of your History
Like Louis-Ferdinand Céline
Yeah street justice was mainly for low level collaborators who got captured
High level collaborators generally had a trial
Like any occurrence of street justice there is that too
I forgot that in english hair means any hair on a body xD
Just the head , don't worry x')
Like préfet Papon
He was an insanely good politician if anything, not an ethical one, but genius manipulator nonetheless
And he kept his friendship with some infamous people such as Bousquet
People who voted for him because he was from the left couldn't believe he'd been awarded the francisque medal by Pétain
The shape "justice" takes for the rich and poor differ often differs
Low level collaborators were also only likely to be killed in the few months after the war due to Resistance Reprisals
It quickly stopped afterwards, since governmental pursuits of collaborators was quite light
Damn, I did Loches, Cheverny, Blois, Chambord, Amboise, Clos Lucé, Saumur, Chinon, Haut Koenigsbourg from the top of my head
Probably went to a few in the south west of France too
A lot
Castle are pretty common in Europe so I think most of us can't count
I didn't keep count
does it need to be a castle-castle (museum or still inhabited), or does the local housetown-building-castle count too
Only the one i live in, or when i visit a friend
I have absolutely no idea
I would hazard a guess around 50-100
My best friend had a castle in her back garden that was often used as a film set
Her mum was very proud of having served a cup of tea to Ewan McGregor
Even my university had a castle on campus
We’d wait until it snowed and then everybody would use those big IKEA bags to sled down the embankments
It’s so common that I kind of forget to view them with awe anymore
My least favourite is the very lovely Chirk Castle in Wales because I once locked myself in the dungeon there by accident and wasn’t discovered for a good couple of hours by which point I’d convinced myself I was going to die there
It’s really cool
I love that it’s pink too, it looks really unique
> Königsberg
I don't know if you joked or not, but [Haut-Kœnigsbourg] isn't Königsberg (Kaliningrad), it's in Alsace
[This one ?]
I know, but you are not talking about the same thing
/u/ItsACaragor talked about a castle in Alsace, in Eastern France, called the Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg
[Wiki article]
I work for a printing company that's also an office equipments store and art supplies store
I get 50% discount on everything (I draw and paint, so it's worth it), we also have a thirteenth month of salary, divided and paid in July and December
On Fridays, the company bosses buy food, usually barbecue stuff etc
lots of wine, and we all eat together, invite us all to restaurants for Christmas and gift us with gift checks things, that you can spend in lots of stores which I would count as a benefit
The sweet sweet thirteen month and prepaid vouchers for lunch
Health insurance, vouchers or reduced price for cinema/spa tickets, ski pass, stuff like that
Great offers for travel (400€ to go 5 days to New-York, hotel included, and meals for morning and evening for example)
We also have some events done by the company which are free
And we have some partnerships to have vegetable baskets, bio food, things like that
There is also a compensation for meals and home-work transit but I think it's in the French law anyway
I work for the state so obviously I get nothing
I know well how the tax administration works which is very handy when it comes to my personal taxes but that’s about all
Health insurance
I mean, they take some money from my monthly pay, but that insurance + social security entirely cover my regular monthly trips to the endocrinologist, occasional generalist visits, dentist, medical imaging, other specialists, and prescription drugs at the pharmacy
Oiseau would be it I think, a very common word actually, since it simply means "bird". Now if you add y, things get more complicated
I don't get it
I get that it's a reference to The Room, but what's the link, ELI5 please
Hell yeah
Drunk singing is one of those things that make life more enjoyable !
Africans speakers are easy to understand, until they start to drops Swahili or specific linguo words
Quebec accent can be hard to get and then they have a different set of anglicism and confusing vocabulary variations (*voiture* vs
*char*)
Yep, just like your post :)
Honestly, even though it can be tough sometimes, in the end, it's quite easy
Africans speaking French sure have one hell of an accent (and very diverse from region to region), but once you get used to it, the vocabulary is more or less the same
but the accent
Canadian french is fine, you just need 20 minutes of adaptation for the accent and then you can understand virtually everything beside their slangs
I'm not fluent in spanish and portuguese but I'm like a strong B2 I guess
For spanish, I think Mexican spanish is super fucking easy to understand, they speak slow and nice
Chileans speak like they have a train to catch in 5 seconds and they need to hurry the fuck up to finish their sentence, which makes their spanish difficult to understannd for me
I learnt Brazilian portuguese and I still struggle a lot with European portuguese, the phonology is completely different
Brazilian sounds weirdly more like spanish and European portuguese where it feels like they mumble throught words
Apparently portuguese people don't have any issue understanding brazilians
Still easier to understand a dude from Central Africa speaking french than someone from the suburbs of Lens
Quebec does use a lot of anglicisms too, but they are different from the ones used in France
Of course you speak baguette, but you have a weird accent, that's all
All poles speak baguette with a mushroom, tomato sauce and cheese accent
TIL
Un anglois qui parle français
On a finalement réussi ? On vous a vaincu ? Après Jeanne d'Arc, Azincourt, Trafalgar, Waterloo, Fachoda, on tient enfin notre revanche ? :)
Les anglais ne nous ont jamais officiellement vaincu et chassé de leurs terres après l'invasion de 1066
L'Angleterre c'est la France
Ich auch
Boring answer but you can't get much more "defining event" than the french revolution
The French Resistance
Behind every political choice and about what we choose to define ourselves as French is the line between Vichy and la France Libre
The speech André Malraux gave during the transfer of Jean Moulin's ashes to the Panthéon is to this day the most enthralling and emotionally shaking speech EVER pronounced and recorded in our history
It only compares to Martin Luther King's speech "I have a dream".
People being beheaded, mass protests, politics are messy and everyone hates everyone, Age of Enlightment, very cool flag, very cool symbols (Marianne, cocarde, bonnet phrygien)
I’d argue that WW2 was as defining as the Revolution
It shaped our current politics (change of republics, of political parties, of influences among them
the far right is no longer made out of monarchists, for example: it’s made out of fascists)
(This is a very simplified vision of things, as there are still French monarchists, and the French right is kind of in a crisis, but it gets the point across
I just meant the entirety of it and its impact, I wasn't talking about Napoleon or the Napoleonic wars that followed, though they had a huge impact as well
That's still part of the Revolution
It was quite long
I don't think people believed the accusation of incest
In fact, it was so obviously false they put it aside and it wasn't mentionned in the final charges and sentence
They just wanted MA to be executed
She defended herself so well that the audience was becoming more and more hesitant (a part was thinking Hébert went too far with that accusation, especially the mothers who could relate more with MA), but the jury was composed of corrupted radicals republicans
It was just a rigged trial, the goal was to execute MA, no matter how she behaved
The public accuser, Fouquier-Tinville (whose surname was "The supplier of the guillotine", to give you an idea of the man), was an opportunist and was famous for his lack of mercy, and required and obtained the execution of more than 2000 people (and like quite a lot of important people of that time, he was himself guillotined after the Terror)
He basically fabricated false proofs, false witnesses, etc (we _did_ find proofs that she was giving informations to her family in Austria so she _was_ guilty of treason, but it was long after the trial so she shouldn't have been executed at that time)
MA had no chance from the start
She kind of knew it, knowing who was in charge, but at the same time, she still defended herself as much as she could
Was she completly guilty ? It's hard to judge from our time, but it's certain that she didn't have a fair trial at all
It was just to keep up appearences of a republic where all citizens are equal and have the right of a trial, and to satisfy the population who hated her (she was I think the most hated queen in French history, even before the French revolution, with maybe C. De Medicis)
Yes, her son Louis died in prison from illiness (caused by severe abuse)
He was beated, sexually assaulted and endoctrinated into hating the monarchy and his own family for two years
He was ten years old when he died
Truly horrific
All of the family members died on the guillotine apart from Louis XVI's brother who escaped in Belgium just in time (and then became the king Louis XVIII after the fall of Napoleon), and one of Louis XVI's daughters, Madame Royale, who lived a long life and never fully recovered from the events and her trauma (which is quite understandable)
Not fun fact : the two lawyers of MA, Chauveau-Lagarde and Tronsson (who were very famous btw because they defended a lot of famous revolutionnaries like Charlotte Corday, Bailly) were summoned just after the trial and had to justify themselves because they were defending MA "too much" for the General Safety Committee
They were both skilled and upright, and did as much as they could to save her, because it was their job, despite the pressure from the Committee
Both were arrested during the Terror and narrowly escaped the guillotine
I have never ever heard of her being accused of incest
It's less known but there was the same kind of stuff toward Louis XV
His rule is famous for the fight between the absolute monarchy and the regional parliaments with the latter saying the law has biggest power than the king and people serving the law are somehow independnt from the king
So there was a famous strikeback from the monarchy with Louis XV coming to the Parliament of Paris and recalling everyone who's in charge ( in a badass speech "discours de la flagellation" ) where he say that people of law are his royal officers and making justice is the duty of the king, peace within the kingdom is the most sacred duty of the king, there cannot be a rival power to the king within the monarchy etc etc and his minister Maupeou bannished the Parliaments, makes the justice free and remplace all the former people of law by royal officers
Of course the bourgeoisie wich was the main social category working as people of law is upset and start spreading rumors and especially one : Louis XV is handsome despite being in his 50, that's because he takes bath filled with blood of virgin girls abducted to Versailles and others stuff like that
>Yes, her son Louis died in prison from illiness (caused by severe abuse)
He was beated, sexually assaulted and endoctrinated into hating the monarchy and his own family for two years
He was ten years old when he died
Truly horrific
That's not true and is at best some shady royalist propaganda
Louis XVII was severely mistreated, but by neglect
There is no evidence of him being beaten, even less so sexually assaulted
Antoine Simon, the only real caretaker before Louis sickness, cared very little about educating or indoctrinate the child either (because he was not paid nearly enough to care) and Louis had to be coerced into testifying against his mother
The kid did not deserve his fate, but there is no need to darken the story
So what is your point ?
Most of it honestly as I'm not very fond of food, but snails is the first one that came to my mind
Oysters at Christmas and New Year's dinners
And not food, but I can't stand the smell and taste of alcohol
Le boudin blanc, and le boudin noir
They are disgusting
I could not stand then as child and I cannot stand them now
In London, where stuff is expensive, it's actually good value for food brought to your table
Of course I need a whole chicken to be satisfied, but it's the cheapest reasonably healthy food you can get at a central London restaurant
That's because Germans don't know how to make it
Come over to France and have a choucroute, you'll see what you're missing
Snails aren't popular
Not a lot of people I know ever tried snails
That's such a cliche
I know right, I don't deserve this title
I mean I remember the big christmas dinners with the entire family and pretty much everyone would eat snails bar kids, and me
For me it's every Christmas, and you see a lot of them in supermarkets in December
It's rare in restaurants though, except in some specific regions
Frogs however are basically non-existant, and few French people have even tasted them (I haven't )
No because I'm fine as I am right now, don't care about food nor do I want to
It could become kind of annoying if I ever travel to another country, like I'd need to take my own food with me or some shit, I'll see when that happens
Omg for real
We never had snails for Christmas
Oysters are a thing though, and I hate it
Cliché but mostly because they are expensive
If they weren't I think they'd be a more common dish
Definitely a cliché. I've never seen frog's legs in a restaurant or at a table
The only person I know who tried them once is my father and he hates them
Snails, OTOH, are uncommon but not rare
A minority of people really like them
If there's someone who likes snails in a family, they're at the Christmas table
Snails are easily available and about 10% of restaurants would have them on the menu, but frog's legs I've seen on a menu maybe twice in my life
I'm from Burgundy so that's probably why we have so much snails
In my family the kids got snails, the grown ups got foie gras
Hundreds and hundreds of snails
Yum
Haha they kept all the foie gras for themselves that's sad
Well, they’d occasionally send a cousin (older kid) to give us some, but he’d eat it all himself between the two tables
"La bise" - basically giving everyone 2 (or more, usually up to 6) kisses on the cheek everytime you greet them and again when you're about to leave them
Also has to be done with total strangers, if being introduced in a casual context
To this day, the only known technique to escape it is to pretend being sick
>usually up to 6
Hahaha, what is this madness
I thought 4 was the max
4 is already too much
who does 6
You can also just say that you prefer to shake hands with everyone
My girlfriend did that when she started working there and people just went "alright, then" and no one had any problem with that
You also don't actually kiss, it's more getting your cheek close to the other person's cheek and doing the noise
Actually kissing a coworker on the cheek would be very awkward unless you are mutually into each other and trying to make it clear
It's alright if it is done against the party you don't like
That's how people in a lot of countries think anyway
Well since both are kissing each other's cheek at the same time, you can't be perpendicular to the cheek and give a proper kiss
So it's more like the cheeks are parallel and the lips half touch it I'd say ? ... I would make a drawing but it would be an even poorer explanation, Entschuldigung
That first kiss on the cheek, that's a big oof if I know one
You are not supposed to touch the other's person skin with your mouth at all
It would be extremely weird if I felt a coworker actually coming close to kissing me on the cheek
Because it doesn’t mean anything, it’s a very specific category linked to the US
It’s social
If you are open to advices, feel free to drink when you can but if you do always do so at your own rythm
Don't accept any form of pressure to drink more than you want or faster
That will save you a lot of headaches over the years
You generally kiss people everyday in France
It's just the way we greet
That's another option
Oh what are they
Haha very cool
Obviously Le Louvre is great, but le Musée d'Orsay is absolutely splendid too
My favourite Paris' museum certainly is le Musée National des Arts Asiatiques (national museum of Asian art), or more simply called Musée Guimet
It's just absolutely magnificent
Otherwise le musée de la mignature et du cinéma (museum of mignature and cinema) in Lyon is absolutely breath taking if you're a cinephile
It full of film sets and props
There even is the triceratops from the first Juracic Park and the Alien queen from Aliens
A must see if you're in Lyon
Rijksmuseum, definitely, even if only for Rembrant's The Night Watch
It was eerily haunting and I stayed there for ages looking at it (also massively bigger than I thought it would be
Warsaw Uprising Museum is definitively the museum to do in Warsaw for any foreigners (at least for frenchmen)
90% of frenchmen never heard about Warsaw Uprising (I guess it is the same for most western and southern europeans) and few people confuse warsaw uprising and warsaw ghetto Uprising
Personnaly I knew about Warsaw Uprising before, but I learnt things visiting It
>	Rome: Musei Vaticani
But
It is not from your country
Yeah the impressionidt gallery is my favourite
And just the setting in itself
A former train station now turned into a wonderful museum
They exist and are known, but are not as common as McDonald's (the most common chain) or even Burger King or Subway
I only ate there once and it was very good, sadly I've never had one close to the places I've lived
Their official website says there over 250 restaurants in France for now and they plan to double that number in the next 10 years
Not as common as McDonald's but you'd expect I every bigger city
My city has 3 KFC's and only is the 8th biggest town of France, so you'd find more or less everywhere
Apparently we have 262 but I've never seen one in my life
Just a fun fact, they're called PFK in Québec which is a litteral translation of the brand's name to respect the law
It's pretty prevalent
I think you have one at least in every middle-big cities but in big cities  you usually have more than one
IT's not as prevalent as mcdonald tho and it has only been a decade since it started to get popular I guess
I mean, the first time I saw a KFC was around 2009 and I thought it was a regional "americanized fast food" kind of thing
I think the second time I saw one was in 2012-2013
Yes, France is the second consumer of anime -Japan being the first
That data is correct
All of those seem credible to me
Some would think Italians are first by far for pizza, but you guys prefer quality over quantity
It's seen as a basic adult skill, at least for the basic meals, the more traditional meals are more family recipes and things you improve on over the years
I grew up in a third world country
Very often the range of ingredients was limited to seasonal produce and some things were just no available all the time
My cooking has always been having an idea of type of dish - stew, soup, pasta, dumplings, pie
- and using the ingredients I have at hand
I honestly feel it's more fun to cook like this
On the other hand I'm not very good at following recipes lol
Netherlands, even if we do have a border
United Kingdom
You guys are getting neighbours ?
Well the Uk, but also Ireland
There's not much sea between us
The Netherlands, if you don't count overseas territories
There's a border between French and Dutch speakers that runs through France and Belgium, but no direct border to the Netherlands
England if you don't count the tunnel
England obviously because we are very close and historically we have always been related
Did you mean: Man is lonely
Soon
he made a joke with the name of his island
Armenia, Moldavia and probably a couple of stans
Yes you're right
Isn't this one more one way though
I was making a joke as well :(
Monaco, the only country that matters
We bullied everyone
We're the best country in the world, so everyone's jealous
And they all say we think we're superior
I don't know why they say that
I don't.
I think we're too similar
Good food, good booze, fashion, etc
And Euro 2000, WC2006
I understood some of what you guys were saying but it sounds like you guys were having fun
It's "les différentes", but other than that, that's pretty good ! Miles better than my italian (I also never studied Italian)
Can't blame you, French is weird as shit
We do love our silent letters, but it's feel really weird without them
Je veu dire, ça a quan même l'air sacrémen stupid comme ça, tu ne trouve pa ?
There is a lot of soldiers and officers with rifles patrolling in Paris wich you would not see in others cities aside Marseille maybe
Housing is expensive af it's a joke
Public transportation is fine but dirty
Everything cost much than in others regions, even a simple coffee
Cultural and social life are very good
You have the best schools of the country ( but good luck to house not so far from them )
There is a lot of remnants from ancient eras wich is cool
There is a lot of tourists everywhere ( not true since the outbreak tho )
Sometimes you can encounter the republican guard moving with horses between their barracks wich is cool too
It's really not the same
Some French even say Paris is not France
For having lived in Kraków for a year and remember it being a very, very important city in Polish history, I've always wondered how important is it in the news
Is the city a major one in the Polish economy/politics being the second largest
That's very interesting and it reminds me of how much Paris is mentioned in our news compared to the other main cities though they always tell that the area they talk about is in Paris
However Marseille and Lyon (2nd and 3rd city) are mentioned fairly often
Yep
People act different, think different, and we dont really understand eachother
Decisions for all the country are mostly made in Paris, so thats actually a problem
The occitan, auvergnat (or else) Guy doesnt give a .... about Paris people problems
A lot of us don't trully mind, at least my friends and I don't.
We kinda got used to it
Not only that, but also because the area known as Germany developed with many different princedoms, city states etc which gave it a couple of big cities
Berlin was picked as the capital because it was the capital of Prussia since it was Brandenburg
Thus it never got as centralized and important to the country as Paris and London were to France and Egland
Another example with other cities as big/important as the capital due to history could be Italy, with Milan, Torino, Naples
I'm occitan and cévenol, so yeah I'm totally in this, Paris and Parisians feel like another planet for us
I still don't like it, and never will
As a whole they give ppl a sense of security, it's at least the reason I heard when the gov decided to renew their presence a few years ago even tho they don't really do much against terrorism
No, not in France, but at some point there was a trend to give scratch cards (they were selling cards as a set of 5 in a pretty gift envelope) as a small present

I am from France
My best memorie
It was when I was a little kid
Less than 10 years old
With my father, my stepmother and my brother, we went to Italia because we were in holydays in Antibe which is relatively close
We came by mountain roads
It was odd to hear the Italian radio
But satisfying
We arrived in a pretty town, in front of the sea
We ate at a restaurant and it started
There was a sidewalk with some small posts
I ran on this sidewalk and a fell down
If I would have done nothing, the post should have been right in a very sensitive part of my body, between my legs (I am a guy) but I rotated and I landed, with all my strenght, on my elbow
I was crying and crying
And Here it was beautiful
Italian people came to me to reconfort me ! An old man came out of his house and gave me  a grape
He was an ancient football player of a famous Italian club
This is my best memorie from another country
In france, if I would fall down in the street, nobody would care
But in Italia, a foreign country with nobody I knew, people were helping me
I said "grazzi mile" a lot of time
It was awesome
> I point at my watch and say "but there is still ten minutes left". He looks me dead in the eyes and says "no", keeps staring at me for a second or two and then just walks away
You got the real French experience here honestly
Hahhaha yup
French people take their lunch brakes very seriously
The France thing is frequent, it's also true for shops or supermarkets, if you enter in the last minutes you'd better hurry
> France: a hidden beach in sardinia
Never saw such a great water
Hmmm, I don't believe we colonised Sardinia yet
Paul Carbone and then Antoine Guerini, Corsican leaders of the French connection which was estimated to be responsible for 80% of the heroin circulating in the US in 1970 thanks to a collaboration with Lucky Luciano in the US
The French connection soured relationships between France and the US at some point as France was accused of not trying hard enough
Then French and US police collaborated more and succeeded in stopping the connection
Don't you guys had some Ecstasy Lord
There’s an Arte reportage about guerini I believe -or was it about the Corsican mafia in WW2
It was interesting
There is a nice 70s movie by William Friedkin about this story
Yeah until the end of the Battle of France the use of Pervitin was widespread in German armies, up to 833,000 tablets per day were produced in the Reich and the Wermacht received 35 millions tablets between April and July 1940
It's more than just the shock troops that were given a little boost but a whole front fueled with drugs
Amid medical concerns, already known and voiced by Leonardo Conti before the war but ignored, the use of Pervitin was cut and already limited by the the end of 1940
At the start of the Russian campaign drugs were already scarce and some kept for "emergency", but nothing compared to the extent of what was used in Poland and France
Thanks that interesting to know
The account I read talked about emergency without much details (hence why I put it between quotes), I didn't know if it was for some offensive or given to units during long march
Giving it as a reward kinda make sense
There are a few lmao
Brittany and the Pays Basque have a strong national identity but i don't think they would actually secede
The part most likely to secede is Corsica imo
They're great with tourism but they are apparently not welcoming at all to mainlanders who want to settle there
Probably some oversea territory
The strong nationalist identities are the Pays Basque, Corsica ans Brittany
I don’t really see them seceding anytime soon to be honest
Corsica keeps electing nationalists are their regional parliament but it’s mainly to negotiate special statuses and things like that, they don’t actually want to secede
Nouvelle Caledonie asked for an independence referendum, as promised in their status they can have three referendums with only people living there since the 90’s at least being allowed to vote, if indépendance wins in one of those they are out
They have had two referendums so far which were both in favour of remaining French, the third one will be in September 2022 so we will see then
If the Spanish Basque Country becomes independent the French part will probably join it
None of those are in any way likely to secede
New Caledonia and maybe Polynesia would be the correct answer
I would also say New Caledonia
Corsica could only survive if they join Italy
They are literally dependent on mainland financial support
The tourism don't provide for the whole year
Even if Breton people would want to, Brittany is kilometers away to see that coming
The simple fact that this region is highly strategical for France economically but especially militarly is a dead-end
Same thing for Alsace
I'm not picturing a world while France could allow anyone in the metropolitan area to secede anyway
Brittany had a terrorist independist movement, they have not a lot of support nowadays anyway
Only Corsica and some overseas territories would have support from they own population for independance imho
From what i've heard, French Polynesia is pretty satisfied
The French gov calmed down and FP gained more autonomy
Apparently the separatists have since declined in popularity because of this
Definitely agree about New Caledonia though
It's actually just New Caledonia
New Caledonia is only a few percentage away from independence while Corsica, Brittany and everywhere else are far from being able (and being willing) to be independent
Unless they find a lot of money in their territory (precious ore or oil), they are too poor to afford independence, especially when they have much poorer neighbor independent islands
Mayotte is a good example of this, the Comoros from which it was separated are much poorer and they emigrate to Mayotte
Corsica would go where
It can't sustain itself and is not more Italian than French
There are stray cats, no stray dogs
I know there are programmes to capture and neuter stray cats
Wild boars
Stray cats also are a fauna problem
They’re not that many, so you would likely not notice them, but they are destroyers
There are so many of them
The homeless take care of some of them ( in the city )
I've never seen a stray dog in my life, so I'd say no
I don't think so, there's probably a bunch of stray cats but that's all
In overseas territories, it is much more a problem though
The vets can't spay them fast enough
Don't fuck with my vacation plan
Ah yes I have heard of difficult situations in placces like La Réunion
I am not familiar enough, i was referring to la metropole only, you are right to point that out
Haha, no, I guess it sounds weird in English
They "just" attack birds & little animals, which is pretty awful for the environment
Oh, and they have (lots of) babies too
Blue ink is the most popular colour for handwritten documents
Official documents that need to be scanned sometimes require black ink to be more legible
Pupils and students frequently use fountain pens and only blue ink cartridges can be erased so that makes it the de facto colour of choice
Blue is the standard
Black is used when the [4 couleurs] is out of blue
Well we have color copiers down here
Joke aside, I would say that in the corporate world, there is not so much hand writing anymore, apart from signing documents, and even that is almost digital nowadays
Nonetheless, black is probably preferred for easy copying reasons precisely
So you probably have a point with legal documents, where it is important to be able to identify an original
But with digital documents this is not an issue anymore
Documents are digitally signed and any alteration is traceable
Go to drink with the parents, kids always find home
Here, parents never stay, but it's not the norm to invite all the kids classroom, most birthday parties host about 6 kids for like 2 hours, so it's easy to manage with only one adult
Also a different things with american tvshow: we only have cake (without ice or cream) and sweets, never savory snacks
Birthday parties are generally low key here: everyone play a simple game, then cake, then gifts
And that's it
Current Constitution article 2 first sentence says the language of the Republic is French, which makes teaching in regional languages in public school an issue apparently
Some places try to teach them as foreign languages but they are very few
Isn't Sámi a language more than a dialect
Because it's in a completely different family than Swedish
I'm not sure if this is relevant here, but how much of a different is there between Nynorsk and Bokmål?
Yes it's a family of languages, related to Finnish
You can
Because I'm French and unless someone has a southern accent which is very recognizable, I can't fucking tell if they're from Paris, Lyon, burgundy, Alsace or the north, most people just sound the same with slight variations in expressions used, sometimes
>Even with my poor domain of French I can tell aside Northern accents from Sourthern accents and usually Parisian from all the other ones
Also, if someone says ouitante or nonante or renversé instead of café au lait I'll know they are from la Romandie, for example
Lol ? I'm from Brittany and used to go a lot in eastern France in my chlidhood because of my family from my father's side, now I am in Paris for studies and I can't say at all from what region is someone by hearing him speaking because every native sound the same
Elder people might use regional words sometimes and that's it
My grands-parents from Vosges used alsacian and even german words randomly in their sentences but the way they spoke french was indentical to my family from Brittany
My girlfriend is from Marseille and she doesn't have any accent at all neither
I know english have noticeable accents like the irish one and the american one but french in the metropolitan France is very uniform nowadays
[pan bagnat] typical from Nice, France
Bread is this special pan bagnat shape but it's usual French bread, it's bathed (hence the name) with olive oil, a dash of vinegar, then filled with all the lovely  stuff on the picture, protein part being tuna and hard boiled eggs and anchovies
Baguette, butter and ham
Simple but amazing
I enjoy smoked salmon
Baguette, pesto, parmesan, mozarella, tomato slices
&#x200B;
There's a bakery I know that serve that one in a special baguette that got a bit of olive oil and black olives in it
It's like heaven
Jambon Beurre
A hot dog
Because it's a sandwich
a good « jambon-beurre »: baguette, ham and butter
or a Bánh mì, which is a Vietnamese sandwich made with baguette, vegetables, soy sauce, spices
there can be also meat like chicken
it ‘s delicious !
Jambon Beurre
This so the first thing my sister gets everything she comes back to France
Add some salad so you can say that you are eating healthy
cheese and chocolate
*die in French*
wow, ftira looks appetizing
the hole in the center of the bread brings lots of crunchy crusty part in every mouthful, I bet, that seems great
Always wanted to visit Malta, I really should
salade
I agree that all this is great, but I'm talking about a baguette freshly made from the local bakery, with salted butter and white ham
And there you have perfection itself
or just that you have good taste
the crunch man
true, just a leaf on the side so people can see I'm a healthy boi
What I know under the name "panini"
* It's put in a sort of a press that cooks the sandwich enough for the cheese to melt
* The bread is a white bread made of wheat, like a baguette, but it's thinner, the crust is completely different and the "foam" inside is much thinner than a baguette
* Most places don't use quality ingredients, the cheese will be some cheap crap
* No pesto
wow
that’s just- wow
i’m really curious about the taste but- wow
you know we’ve started revolutions for less than this
à l'italienne
I'm sorry, it was more for the ham part, I'm really not good with words, no matter the language haha
yeah AH AH AH so fun ! we surrendered once but just to remind you, we are the country with the highest amount of military victories in the world
and you Dutchmen, what do you do ? you eat cheese with chocolate
gross
food is sacred
show some respect
BUT, now i might want to try
just scientific curiosity
so what cheese and what chocolate would you recommend ? :)
Some corrupted politicians are going down
Switzerland so I don't need to learn German
Austria
Innsbruck in the winter is one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited, and Vienna is a fantastic city
Germany because my sister is there
I lived in Geneva and it's pretty boring tbh
Recently did a Lyon Marseille (about 1h45 travel) round trip in TGV (high speed train) and paid 80€ for the whole thing
I could have got it for less if I had taken less practical hours as off hours are typically much cheaper
Me and a friend went to visit another friend in Bern, who lives 15-20 minutes away from the city center by tramway, and she made us take the car and park it in the city center for a whole afternoon because it was cheaper than buying tickets for us single trip peasants
In addition to being affordable and fast, it also seems
most of your trains allow bicycles, which is uncommon in Germany and France (not exactly uncommon, but there's specific rules for every different type of train)
Do you agree ?
It’s the same unit, some people just like to mark the plural
It was a round trip in my case so it was actually two tickets so it’s not very expensive
I have no idea
Probably just a personal thing
I remember my physics teacher saying not to do it or it would be confused with kilometer per second
I wouldn’t call it wasted time, it was still informative
I learnt that you had to buy two seats with covid in Italia which is a bit insane for example
Honestly I have experienced both as I worked and lived in both France and Germany
The SNCF has a terrible reputation locally but I find that they always make a plan for their fuck ups
When you are a real regular you can count on them
Not during a strike though
And that can happen fairly regularly, since they generally follow one another
Haven't had one in a while though
In Germany I have experienced huge fuck ups (4hrs late with ICE) and no compensation whatsoever because not everything is automated
Their website and customer care is not on par with the French trains
Prices are expensive on both sides
I'd like to add that the regional trains in France are close to non existent in comparison to Germany, although much cheaper
Reaaaaally uncommon
France is heavily centralized
The US are not centralized, by any definition of the word
You are literally a federal state
Way more
We don't have states, we have regions, they have some powers and budget but can't design local laws or school programs
It's not even decentralized, it's federal
"Decentralized" implies a unitary state
Paris isn't that big, it's 10 km wide in diameter
When friends and family come visit I always chose to walk because in half a day you can pretty much see a lot of the city
It's just one of the densest cities in the world despite buildings not having a lot of levels
The suburbs are huge though, and as they don't want to be annexed by the city of Paris, choosing the agglomeration of Paris makes more sense than just picking the city for population comparisons

I love reading and I have no issue reading all sort of books
But I couldn't read it further than the first chapter and I'm glad it's was an educational edition with the summary and some comment on each chapter at the end
Le grand meaulnes, of Alain Fournier
This book was (for me) the definition of boredom, as nothing really happen in this book
Le Quart Livre by Rabelais in ancient French
It’s already hard as it is but in ancient French and with all the authors made up words and obscure metaphors and references I just couldn’t comprehend what the fuck was happening most of the time
Never heard of it

Lived in the UK for 2 years, food is actually really good !
Not all Nordic people are cold and distant
Only the Finns
Icelanders, Swedes and Norwegians are pretty lit, warm and friendly as fuck
Dont know about Danes and the Faroe Islanders though
by the way, how do you call these ones ? Faroeise ?
EDIT : apparently, according to Google, just Faroe Islanders
That’s kind of a really strange misconception to have in the first place
Some people can’t even affort to travel in their own country you know
Haha I know !
The stereotype is strong !
That’s quite mean
If you have a problem with everyone you meet in France, maybe the problem is actually you
Or you're bitter because you haven't been able to make friends
I wouldn’t go that far, no
If you compare Tesco to Monoprix then sure, Monoprix is better
If you compare Carrefour City or G20 to Waitrose or M&S, French supermarkets aren’t that great
I often shop at Carrefour City and the fruit and vegetables aren’t that good most of the time
Also, you won’t find rabbit, quail, guinea fowl, snails and frogs in every supermarket
I’ve actually never seen any frogs in a French supermarket, like ever
Only once at Tang Frères, so a Chinese supermarket
These aren’t even that common in France so I don’t really see why British supermarkets quality should be based on that
Imo, to truly appreciate a culture you don’t know, you shouldn’t systematically compare it to your own
I try to apply this as much as I can when I’m abroad
I also try to put away my preconceptions, so that I won’t judge too harshly all the new things I try
I obviously missed a lot of French food that I wished I could find in the supermarkets there, but I kept in mind that it was normal and it didn’t keep me from enjoying the things that were available
Is it though
I mean, british beef is amazing
You also have the nice sunday roast (with yorkshire pudding and mushy peas) or sausages and mash
Fish and chips, scotch eggs, english breakfast, roast lamb, chicken and mushroom pie, baked potatoes
I also loved the scones, the caramel shortbread and basically everything that goes with tea, elderflower based drinks, pimm’s, british gin
Also, there’s a huge range of various foreign food if you live in London (and in every big city I guess)
I really enjoyed the food there, honestly
Dont go to Paris, come to the South
Montpellier or Toulouse, namely, you'll see we are bloody warm and fiery
You can even initiate a random conversation with someone in the streets here ! :)
But to be fair, I did it in Reykjavik too
but I guess the people there are used to loud, overly-enthousiast tourists
Honestly, I was halfway joking
At first glance, they were the most distant of all Nordics, but the few Finns I managed to keep talking with for a few days after meeting them, slowly let loose eventually
As Stratovarius said :  *Some might say that we are cold but our hearts are made of gold
To be fair, it's mostly the random talk in the streets that was the cultural clash
I'm from the warm and fiery south of France
Here, it's quite normal to randomly hail someone in the street, complimenting their clothes, reacting to something you overheard or stuff like that
Dont do that in Finland
Really dont
But in bars and pubs, it was easier to approach them, even though you would still get confused looks when you neared them
*"I dont know this guy, I just wanna hang out with my friends, I'm not here to meet strangers
oh, he's speaking English, he's a complete stranger then
well, I guess we dont have a choice, let's make the better out of it I guess
But I still love you and your music Finland !
People are not talkative and into small talk, but during my short stay, all interactions were agreable
10mn after seating in the train from the airport to Helsinky central train station, the lady controlling the tickets talked with me because she enjoyed speaking French and she gave a Moomin goodie to my son
I was like "all I was told about Finland is a lie".
I think in France we look East
That’s sweet ! (I wish I had neighbours who cooked for me)
When French act like cliché French, it’s always hilarious !
>Where did I say that
Only because I find the level of politeness lower than other countries doesn't mean I don't like everyone you idiot
Okay, I have the answer ;)
Well I truly had an amazing time there ! :)
There are metaphorical "deserts" in France as well, like la Creuse (literally "the Hollow"), l'Ardèche, la Lozère
and a lot of unproductive regions, mainly in Central and southern France
We even have our own Napoli, it's called Marseille here
And that's mostly what I was referring to
I found that, especially in Iceland and Sweden, it was much easier to randomly engage in a conversation with people in the streets or in bars
Well, I guess the people of Reykjavik are particularly used to noisy, over-enthusiast tourists
But in the end, I felt less intrusive trying to start conversations with Icelanders and Swedes than with Finns
As I said above, the confused looks you can get from Finns when approaching them made things often awkward
It doesnt really make you feel entirely welcomed
Often in my first days in Helsinki, I would break away and leave as soon as possible, feeling like I was just a bother to them
Then, after some time, I decided to ignore the feeling and insist a bit more, and eventually managed to get full on interesting conversations with people
And even see some of them again in the following days !
And despite what I'm saying, I loved Finland and I know it just takes a bit of time to know them, but in the end, the Finns are awesome
just dont rush them too much
I feel you
I love food but I’d rather avoid this kind of social interactions !
>C'est bon mon ami, certains stereotypes sont vrais

>bahhh fluttee
Diantre ! For your effort to maintain our outdated interjections, I wish you all the best
I am perfectly relaxed, I sip a raspberry tea while caressing a purring cat
My last message was not sarcastic, it was even supposed to be friendly
For some reasons, the cliché about our supposed rudeness amuses me much more than it annoys me
I'm okay with it, and I also think they don't have to justify their freedom
Shitty questions to ask Europeans, just another excuse to talk shit about Americans, well done
Most French people don’t invest
They generally leave their money on life insurance contracts or « Livret A ».
Otherwise yeah I have enough money for my leisures and I don’t feel like I really have to count pennies so I suppose I am alright
To be very concrete,  I earn about 2000€ net per month, and after all necessary expenses (rent, bills, food etc
) I am left with 500€ to do whatever I want with it, either invest the money, save it or use it to go out in restaurants, buying myself new clothes and other stuff
I am solidly in the middle class, and quite happy with this situation
I thought 20% of the total price was the minimum required for a deposit
I've seen crazy prices in Switzerland for real estate when compared to France, the flat I'm renting in Vaud is worth around 600 kCHF so I would need minimum 120k to buy it and 25 years to reimburse it, crazy prices but doable and I could find cheaper places in Valais
What are you trying to buy at 2
5M?
Edit : I've re-read my comment and I realised that I've worded it a bit bluntly, I didn't meant to diss you I am always surprised by the crazy amount of money people have to put down in Switzerland to buy real estate, even with salaries way of the chart when compared with European neighbors
Anyway, I apologize if I came out rude, it wasn't my intention
Yes, there is no real stock exchange culture in France
Upper class families usually have "better" investments culture, but it is often in real estate, or some bonds, but nothing too dynamic like day trading
Yeah we are pretty old school and risk averse when it comes to investment generally
Sometimes when I try to translate beautiful english words like "[something] the fuck/shit out of them"
It happen to me too, sometime I have the world in English to describe something but I forget the equivalent in french
For example last time i was searching the word for behavior in french which is "Comportement".
I like Danish because it kinda sounds like German, and I love the German language (very much a minority opinion around these parts)
I guess they're all Germanic (except for Finnish), but Danish feels much closer which would make sense
Didn’t hear all of them, but Icelandic, Swedish and Norwegian are my favorite
What is the number 1 TV channel in your country
In France, the first channel is TF1 (which was privatized in the 80s), which is also the most popular channel
However, as a group, in 2020, the goverment run France Télévision group was the most watched (29% of total viewers), closely followed by the TF1 group (27% of total viewers)
In France, private channel TF1 (French TV 1) comes first, then is followed with public service channels France 2, France 3, and France 5 with private encrypted channel Canal+ in 4th
Strangely enough, im from France and i don't even know, tf1
Not boosting about tv, how they are blah blah blah but with prime, Netflix
torrents it's been a while since i saw any channels
You have channels without ad break
That would be impossible in France
TF1 (télévision française 1) which is the first in channel list, is often called "la 1" ("as in switch the to the first one")
Don't France TV have more channels than thé groupe TF1
Especially with France 3 with every régional versions
Most popular
Yes
The second statistic compared the TF1 group (TF1, LCI, TMC) to the France Television group (whch includes France 2, France 3 regional channel amongst others)
Overall, France has (according to google0 over 584 channels available
C'est quoi le délire de se parler en anglais ?
The way that our words are prononces slighly different but spelled absolutely different
(Vers/verre/vers/vair/vert ...)
That even confuses French people and the majority of the Frenchs cannot spell their own hellish language
That nevers bothered me because the context always makes it simple
Even "Passe le verre vert vers moi" (passe me the green glass) is fairly simple
Oh think it's gets really crazy when we talk about "accord genre/nombre" [ french change depending on female/male & numbers]
It also change depending on verb in front or behind
[This movie scene] always comes to mind when I think about German speakers talking sexy to their partners
No, never
Since we learn that 90 is "quatre-vingt-dix" at a very young age, we never really think about what it actually means
It's just 90 to us
I realised that quatre-vingt-dix meant "4x20+10" when I was around 12 haha
Absolutely never
It's just a word for 90
Whether it's called "ninety" or "quatre-vingt-dix" or "kfjzhdoglg" literally makes no difference
Yes
"Comme même" "enfaite" "sa" à la place (instead of) "ça", "er"/"ez"/"é"....
I found the mistakes highly annoying and I don't know why but it makes me lose credibility in the person
Charlemagne would be proud
It'd be a shitstorm in most cases, the most functional might be Germany
Italy is either a perfect union or a direct civil war
Spain might kinda work ?
Belgium would likely be pissed, same with the Swiss
But you'd just have put us in a quarantine with the UK for a decade or two you either get rid of two dicks at once, or end up with Imperialism 3
0 "La revenge". Quality entertainment
Or we go nuts and create the Franco-Brazilian union, what's the worst that could happen ?
I vote for a merge with Benelux and Germany
France getting Brazil, Germany, Swiss, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Netherlands
*laughs in Empire*
Belgium: We cool except for the north
Germany: We cool
Spain: We cool
Andorra: We cool
Italy: instant cultural civil war
Switzerland and Luxemburg: Oh fuck off with your taxes
Plenty of good options I'd say
+ Germany -> the Carolingian Empire is back baby
+ Italy -> Roman Empire time
+ Spain -> we 100% won the war of the spanish succession
> France: instant civil war over food and wine
Or world domination by mean of wine and food
I don't know
Can confirm
We could reform the roman empire
> France: instant civil war over food and wine
See the good thing, Mona Lisa will be in "your new country". :p

It took me a long time to understand there were other languages
Get me : when looking at a movie or whatever, it was ALWAYS in French
I think what really got me to understand was when I started reading, and upon chosing flags other than the French one on the Gamecube when starting a game, I still couldn't read !
You were so naive, i mean only 3 or 4 of these things are true
> Greece is next to France
> Belarus is a French region
Damn we'd be *big* !
I mean I constantly inverted Romania, Bulgaria and Poland for some odd reason so I can't really poke too much fun
> * Greece is next to France
> * Belarus is a French region
Are you living in 1812
Omg
I didn't know there were other countries making jokes saying Belgians were stupid
I thought it was just a French thing
Why did you believe that
I work in logistic (Company with yellow truck to not say it's name), and during the early part of the COVID shitshow I was working in a "oh fuck the route everything is falling apart and we need medical equipment *fast*, we need a solution".
The country that I had the less problem finding solution with was Italy
The ones I had the most problem (in Europe) was Germany and the Netherlands . Italian were like "oh it's gonna be hard but we'll find something to make it happen", Germans and Dutch were mostly  "You see that's not how we work so wait because we say so".
It was *infuriating*.
TIL
For us it's clearly the tower, if not the whole building
Yeah, Super Bock is not that good, however it's light and refreshing in summer when it's hot
No, sadly we have Paris instead
But in truth, we're just jealous of your beers
>Napoleon tried three times and failed three times
The invasion ? Succeeded
three times
The occupation ? Failed three times, with  a huge help from the UK
Well in a situation where we had to improvise *a lot* it's way better
Moreover it's not like my team was working on medical equipment *only*, which were needed as fast as possible
I'm still *mad* at them, we had to explain to some hospitals that they couldn't have mask and other medical equipment for a few days because of some process that weren't done in the Netherlands, oh the joy of having medical staff crying on the phone while I couldn't do shit because of some process had to be respected
Anyway, yeah, "l’arte di arrangiarsi" should be learned by our Germanic friends, cause next time this kind of shit happens, I'm taking a flight over there to break some jaw
Yes
On the adult table there is wine and they make bad bad jokes that a child shouldn't hear
I think it's depend of the family and the number of kids
When I was a child, for christmas, on my mother's side we were 6 kids about the same age
We didn't have a house big enough to have one huge table with everyone so we just had a kid table
I loved it, it was real fun (exept you had to keep remind the adult table to give you some food too
On my mother's side it was just my brother and I, our cousins were teenagers so we didn't have a kid table
Now we have no kids table on both side simply because we didn't have kids anymore
I'm the youngest and I'm 29
I got a toddler now and my cousin too, when we will have more and when they will be old enough to be on their own, we will probably have a kid table again because it's fun for them
When there are more than 4-5 children and they're old enough but not too much so that they eat with adults, then yes
When you're a teenager you often choose between eating with children or adults
Yes, but only if there's at least 4-5 kids
You're not going to bother doing a kids' table for 3 people
Not unless there are both lots of adults and lots of children
It was a widely spread practice in the 1940s, but the French (and, I believe, northern) vision of children changed a lot since
I think there's no norm it's up to each family and I remember as the elder of the family when I was younger I ate with the adults
True
There were 20 or so of us so a kids table made sense
Sure thing when, as you said, there isn’t enough room
I was speaking of daily life & occurrences, gatherings can be different
I wanted to stay at work during the weekend for the AC
They threw me out and I started to melt
Now I’m in the train, they will have to kick me out too I guess
Every time I see people say that all of france is on fire I take it as a step for the independance of Brittany
I'm fine thanks, and you ?
I’m okay, but does anyone know where are the others French people ? I’ve seen more Estonian people than French one on this subreddit
I'm fine, we had an air conditionning war at work, battling for control of the thermostat, it was lovely
Team 22°C seems to have won at the end
I'm sleeping in my oven because it's colder than my house
I'm totally OK
In Belfast
Sure I'm fine, just bought an AC so I feel better than ever
We are minority 'round here
Only problem is this heat
It is like hell, but hell in hell
I’m fine, the sea is warm so it’s nice to get something refreshing with this heat wave
No, no I'm not
I just closed the window 10 mins ago because I don't want bugs flying in, it has been a hellish day
For French to answer they would have to cooperate with the authority of OP
French don't cooperate with any authority
(Also most don't like to tag themself as French online)
I'm good
In Cambridge
If I was home I'd probably be dying
Pretty fine as long as I’m not in the metro
More than the lack of AC, it’s one of the rare times I actually resent my height: I’m at armpit level
I'm okay, but I don't live in France, which is cheating
I'm OK
Why
Doing great, thanks !
&#x200B;
Plot twist: I live in Mexico
It's not right, but it's ok
South of France here
No AC at work or at home
I get up super early in the morning to get some fresh air in the house in
I'll make it !
There are dozens of us ! DOZENS !
First of all, I don't completely agree
There is always one or more answers from French people to the questions asked
&#x200B;
Secondly, French bashing seems to be part of the Reddit's DNA especially in some subs
Personally, I can ignore it, but I know that some of our fellows may be hurt
Some still find the stamina to teach history classes but don't  last long in front of the extent of the pack's bad faith
This topic [is regularly discussed] on r/France
I think I can recognise the same 20 or so French on this sub, it's quite funny
Faut sortir un tuyau de la fenêtre ? Et est ce que y’a de l’eau qui sort dans un réservoir où tu dois le vider chaque qlq heures ?
Yeaaaaah
I'm going to Erquy today and the water is said to be at 16°C.
It's not a competition friendo
Are you saying that Britanny flag is bad, because if so you should fear for your life
Qu’est-ce qu’il dit !?
Very funny
Bien sûr !
It's a mobile AC
Oui faut faire sortir un tuyau par la fenêtre ce qu'est assez chiant, pour l'instant je me suis fais une installation homme des cavernes avec les volets à moitié ouverts, une seule des deux fenêtres à moitié ouverte, le tuyau dehors avec un rideau derrière pour stopper les insectes et un bout de la chaleur d'entrer, je suis en train de chercher un kit de calfeutrage partout en ville pour pouvoir bloquer totalement ma fenêtre, ils en avaient pu là où j'ai acheté ma clim, et je viens d'appeler tous les magasins du coin, personne en vend et les deux seuls qui en vendent n'ont plus de stock
Mais bon de base j'ai réussi à relativement réduire les degrés d'au moins ma chambre (genre 26-27 au lieu de 29-30) donc j'ai au moins pu dormir correctement
Pas de réservoir d'eau que je sache, ils me disent juste de vidanger par ci par là (pas tous les jours), je sais pas trop comment ça se passe mais je verrai quand le jour viendra
I haven't looked into that, it's too much of a sacrifice for the pesky bugs
I haven't looked into it either, but only just buying shutters took me 3 weeks in France because I had to order them in the right size
And this was with modern windows with a clear serial number
At my parents' house it would fail entirely
The way many windows are set up doesn't really let a space for a wire screen
There are lots of people in close quarters so it doesn’t matter that you’re underground
There’s been lots of delays due to people fainting and being sick
2-1
it was close but so far away
Je crois qu'il parle d'une recette de "riz quoïeur". Et qu'il est drogué et qu'il s'pique
Nah you should have your AC set 10 degrees below the temperature outside
Merci beaucoup :D  je dois acheter un clim alors

The 34°C AC in Nîmes should've hurt yesterday
I didn't have a choice, I wanted to buy one on the internet but they were all sold out or to be sent within "a month or two", I couldn't wait this long, went to many shops yesterday, all sold out
Only today I called one shop and they told me they just received some mobile ACs and I should be coming fast because they were getting sold very quickly, got there, bought one, it's a Blyss, don't know how bad or good it is
>it's the united states flag
C'est justement pour cela qu'il est pathétique
C'est marrant toutes ces références à la Bretagne, et à côté de ça une sur le Mont Saint Michel qui n'a aucun rapport
I put my heating at 22 when I want a boost of heat in winter hahahaha
23 is the perfect temperature
Of course it is a cool flag
J'avoue que j'aime pas le drapeau des états-unis (surtout parce que je les aime pas en général) et que c'est vraiment dommage que le Gwenn ha Du s'en soit inspiré, mais je faisait surtout référence au tweet de je ne sais plus quelle journaliste qui ne le connaissais pas
[Here is the tweet he was speaking about
ಠ_ಠ
[Btw]
I don't intend to let it on all the time, the heat don't bother me that much during the day, it's at night, I cannot sleep when it's +30° in my bedroom
Been 3 days in a row with 5 hours of sleep a day, might be normal for some people but not me, I'm dying

The French "Supreme Court" is called the *Conseil Constitutionnel*, the Constitutional Council
There are 9 members: 3 are appointed by the President of the Republic, 3 by the President of the National Assembly (lower house of Parliament), 3 by the President of the Senate
They are appointed for 9 years, and every 3 years 3 of them are replaced, with the 3 "presidents" picking one each
Former Presidents of the Republic are members by rights after their mandate has ended, but only former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing still take parts in deliberation (although he is 96 now)
The other Presidents still alive (Sarkozy & Hollande) don't sit on the Council (Sarkozy did for half a year)
Depends on which topic
Cour de Cassation is the judiciary organ that checks whether trials are done correctly or not
Conseil d'Etat is the administrative organ
Tribunal des Conflits checks whether it's the first one or the second one that has to deal with a case
Conseil Constitutionnel can do both checking whether a law is constitionnal or not, and set (some) legal precedents
We use a system that's closer to Civil Law than Common Law so we don't really have a Supreme Court
It's not popular because it's not a job where you're very seen in the media, you're getting forgotten
It's a like a retirement house for politicians
4x20+10+9 quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (99)
But honestly, Belgian people say it way much better than we do, they merely say nonante-neuf
I know 4 languages so I can tell for French, German and Hungarian:
In French we have a word for all numbers from 0 to 16 (seize), then we say 10+7 (dix-sept), 10+8 (dix-huit) and 10+9 (dix-neuf)
All numbers between 20 and 69 are regular except 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 because we add an extra "et" (and), e.g. vingt is 20 but vingt-et-un is 21, while vingt-deux is 22, vingt-trois is 23 etc
From 70 to 79, we keep 60 (soixante) as the base and add 1-19 numbers (71 = soixante-et-onze, ..., 79 = soixante-dix-neuf), then numbers from 80 to 99 use quatre-vingt(s) (four twenties) as a base so 80 is quatre-vingts, 81 is quatre-vingt-un, 82 is quatre-vingt-deux, ..., 99 is quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (literally "four twenties ten nine")
German is pretty easy, they have their own numbers until 12, then add "-zehn" to 3-9 numbers to create 13-19 numbers (e.g. 3 is drei and 13 is dreizehn)
Then to create multiples of tens after 20, just take a number between 2 and 9 and add "-zig" (sometimes the radical changes a bit, that's why you have zwanzig, dreißig, sechzig and siebzig instead of zweizig, dreizig, sechszig and siebenzig but all others are regular: vierzig, fünfzig, achtzig, neunzig)
To create compounded numbers, e.g. siebenundachtzig, you say 7 und (and) 80
Under 1 million, everything is written in a single word so 777 777 is written siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebenhundertsiebenundsiebzig
In Hungarian, they have their own words for numbers up to 10
Then 11 is tizenegy (tíz/10 + en/on/ön which is used to combine numbers below 30 + egy/1), 12 is tizenkét or tizenkettő, ..., 19 is tizenkilenc
20 is húsz, 21 is huszonegy (notice that the -en- became -on- to respect the vowel harmony rule, and tíz and húsz lost their accents because the vowels were shortened)
After 29, use -van/-ven to create the multiples of 10 except három/3 thãt becomes harminc/30
Négy/4 becomes negyven/40, öt/5 becomes ötven/50, hat/6 becomes hatvan/60, hét/7 becomes hetven/70, nyolc/8 becomes nyolcvan/80 and kilenc/9 becomes kilencven/90
To create compounded numbers after 29, just put them together like 79 is hetvenkilenc
Like German, you don't need to separate words below 1 million (in some dialects only, else you have to add an hyphen between thousands) so 999 999 is kilencszázkilencvenkilencezerkilencszázkilencvenkilenc or kilencszázkilencvenkilencezer-kilencszázkilencvenkilenc
Yep, english and french sounds are very different
There is no sound for "Un" in english, nor for the "eu" of "deux". The "oi" of 3 should be ponounced "wa", The "in" in "5" is pronounced like un
Same way to wite it almost same pronounciation
Pronounced "Wit" Neuf
"Eu", the return
"Onze" "On" has a weir pronounciation for english people I guess
I love how chat is written exactly like how we say cat in French
Es wurde einfacher zu zahlen aber sehr merkwürdig zu verwenden
>Trivia: "hét" (7) derives from the Proto-Uralic *säptɜ which in fact comes from Proto-Indo-European, so it's a cognate of pretty much all Indo-European equivalents: seven, sieben, siete, sept, zeven, sju, seacht, septyni, siedem, sedam, семь (sem'), सात (saat) etc
In Hungarian, just like in the Ancient Greek ἑπτά (heptá), the s turned into a "h" sound
Ez nagyon érdekes soha nem hittem azt hogy indoeurópai lenne
Actually we prononce 80 and 4 20 differently (80: "quatr-e vin" ≠ 4 20 "quatr vin"
If it's 4,20 we usually say "quatre virgule vingt/deux" or using the unit instead of the comma (4
2m = quatre mètres vingt, 4
2€ = quatre euros vingt)
So it can't be confusing
well, it'll sound weird if you say that in France, because we do not use that
Most would probably understand what you mean however
But if you say this in Nantes or everywhere else in France people will laugh at you
How to fuck up vowel harmony in 1 step
I'm from the South, I pronounce both the same, with a schwa between *quatre* and *vingt*.
De már lattám "kettőezertizenkilenc" and "kettőezerhúsz" az egyik szóként
Thanks I have it but I forgot to put it lol
>Except they fuck everything up from 70 to 99
Maybe I should try to learn Catalan lol
Some would probably laugh just because they're not used to hear these words, but not laugh at a person who would say that
Most would just smile and say something like "oh, you must be Swiss or Belgian"
Yeah uwu (*laughs in quatre-vingt-dix-neuf*)
I know that's what I say lol
Akkor ha használok a 999999-et egy évszámként, írhatok kilencszázkilencvenkilencezerkilencszázkilencvenkilencet
>you're too anglo saxon for us
Can you repeat this oO
We have an old German submarine base in Bordeaux, France
A part of it has been turned in a museum and they recently made a cultural place with beautiful light shows : [link]
I grew up next to the old NATO General Headquarters for Europe in Rocquencourt (le camp de Voluceau) . It was used from 1951 to 1967
These days the barracks and general infrastructure are used as a fire station and research center for IT
It's an interesting place
It was an Italian submarine base at first, before being taken over by the Germans
In some galleries, there are still mines underwater, they are closed off
Another WW2 German submarine base in my town (Lorient) in Brittany
After the war the French Navy took it over but it was sold off in the 90s. There are some marine industrial units there now and there has been a museum built which is open for the public and you can tour the submarine pens
I for one did not know there was a survey
Too bad
Actually if you're on reddit you speak English way better than the french average
Reddit is almost unknown in France
r/France is quite active though
(Though mainly in French)
Obviously the Daft punk, David guetta and dj snake
Several years ago, Jean Michel jarre was very popular as well
In term of singers, maître gims, indila, edith piaf, aznavour, mylene farmer, Gainsbourg, Alizee etc
David Guetta and the Daft Punk
Many fellow frenchies have already answered so I'd just like to add Caravan Palace to the ones they have cited
We have this singer called Zaz, quite known in France but lot in the best of ways
One time a Mexican person told me she was really famous in Mexico, just seemed very random
I remember Lena, who won Eurovision in 2010 with “Satellite”. That's basic pop but still like it
So many fucking good Power Metal out of Germany !
Finland rocks so fucking much
But I always wonder with all these bands, if we can really call them famous
I mean, as a Metalhead myself, I know them all and know how huge their concerts are, but I'm wondering if someone who's never even tried Metal ever heard those names
TIL Shirley Bassey was Welsh
Demis Roussos and Nana Mouskouri are pretty famius in France
Manu Chao
Pretty fucking big in Latin America
On the top of my mind:
* [L'Italiano] by Toto Cotugno
* [Felicita] by Al Bano
* [Ti amo] by Umberto Tozzi (may be the best known italian song in France)
* [Sarà perchè ti amo] by Ricci e Poveri
Bonus:
* [Le Rital] by Claude Barzotti
Yeah, I know (and love that), my question is more alongside the lines of: let's say an American who's never listen to Metal
has (s)he ever heard the name Nightwish
Of course these bands are internationally famous inside the Metal community
but are they internationally famous overall outside of the Metal community
I doubt it, sadly
I have no doubt even a Finn who doesnt listen to Metal has heard at least once some Ensiferum
but the question is "internationally", not "nationally"! :)
No, I did not know
In fact I had not noticed he actually says “Arriverderci Roma” in the song
Thanks
You say hello before every interaction with anyone
You get in the bus: bonjour to the driver; need some help in a shop: bonjour to the sales assistant; you enter a waiting room with people already there: bonjour to them
Ask a random person in the street for direction: Bonjour
If you don’t it’s like not recognising people existence as human beings
When you leave: merci, au revoir/ bonne (journée/soirée)
Unless you live in Paris
We don't have time for hello/thanks/bye
Well that's about the same in France, glad to know I wouldn't be awkward if I went to a doctor's in south Poland
Aah in Bayern sagte ich immer "hallo", jetzt verstehe warum sie mich seltsam ansahen
Well we complain a lot as well and it doesn't impeach to greet people :)
Akkor ez hogy megy a vidéken
I don't agree, i live near Paris and it's still a must
Would be rude not to actually
Except for at the bakery
Best not slip up, motherfucker
La "province" >>> Paris de toute façon
Tout à fait d'accord !
Na ich hörte beide
I would recommend [Le Roi et l’Oiseau] by Paul Grimault, the old schools Astérix movies ([Astérix le Gaulois] [Astérix et Cléopâtre] ), [les Douze travaux d’Astérix] and most movies by Michel Ocelot ([Kirikou et la Sorcière] [Azur et Asmar] [Princes et princesses]
When I was a kid I also watched Code Lyoko on TV
Amazing show alternating between 2D and 3D, comically large heads and [killer theme] [Galactik Football] was top tier too
Edit: as mentioned by mes gars sûr below, the « Il était une fois
» series were masterpieces and taught kids about history, the human body and space, amongst others
Check out [Once upon a time
Mankind] and its dramatic/terrifying intro, [Once upon a time
Life] and [Once upon a time
Space]
Hey, while we're at it, some classics like Inspector Gadget and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a lot of work done in France, and they qualified as "French" for subsidy purposes
And them the're lesser known but still great classics like the Mysterious Cities of Gold, and the "Once upon a time" series
I learned not long ago that Ratz, space goofs (les zinzins de l’espace) are also french
In recent years we also have Last Man, Poupoudou, Vermines, Long way North (Haven’t seen it but it looks quite beautiful), a part in the red turtle, my life as a courgette, I lost my body, Waltz with Bachir
We also have one of the best animation school in the world Les Gobelins in which students have to a short film to graduate that are shown at the Annecy Festival and are available on Yt
Totally Spies is also French and is the most exported French cartoon ever
The recent asterix movies too, asterix and the secret of the magic potion is just great
I’d add Le tableau (The painting)
It’s about characters of a painting who are discriminated because the painter half painted them, and never finished his work
One “fully painted” and a “half painted” are in love: Lola (the half painted) decide to find the painter, and ask him to resume painting
Edit: way to many “paint-something” in these sentences
I would add valse avec Bachir even if it’s not solely french but germano-Israeli-french
And le chat du rabbin
More recently, the Wakfu series and the Dofus movie are also great
I hope they'll eventually make the sequels
Mais comment j’ai pu oublier les Il était une fois ! Par contre honte à moi, à part le générique je connais rien des Mystérieuses cités d’or
Aaahhhhhh les Ratz
Impossible to see them again nowadays (as I'm not a child anymore), but damn did I live them
And I saw so many les Gobelins productions on YouTube
Top tier
Nice
Did you ever read Asterix and the Goths
What did you think about it
I have fond memories of traveling in Europe with my family and there would always be German TV channels in hotels
So I ended up watching lots of German cartoons even though I never understood what was said
Schnappi das kleine Krokodil is engraved in my memory
Ok but the post was about animation
Les Mystérieuses cités d’or ca n'a pas tres bien veillit, pour etre honnete
Je les ai manquees quand j'etais petit, et je n'ai jamais reussit a tous les voir, meme si j'ai le box set DVD depuis 20 ans et des poussieres
La cucaracha is a basic of middle school Spanish lessons in France aha
Don’t ever watch the movie they made about Asterix at the Olympics then
They tried to make a pan-European show (they even got Michael Schumacher, Monica Bellucci, Benoît Poelvoorde) but it turned out to be a complete shitshow
I never thought it would have any success outside of France and Belgium
Oh, I know one
In european portuguese, "rapariga" means "young lady/Miss".
In brazilian portuguese, it means "whore".
So NEVER call a girl "rapariga" in Brasil, go by "senhora".
When I was in Belgium I met a bunch of Walloons that would use "excited" in the English sense, i.e "enthusiastic"; in France, it only means "aroused", so I was a bit confused at first
[Here's] an article that deal with the French (from France) meaning of the word
In France, "gosse" is a common familiar word for kid
In Quebec, it means testicule
So when you say "T'as pas vu mes gosses ?" (Have you seen my kid ?) in Quebec can create quite a funny situation
This is wrong
Joder absolutely means "to screw" even in Spain
No me jodas, estoy jodido
> Similarly, in BR-PT "pica" means "cock", in European Portuguese the main usage refers to "energy".
I imagine Pikachu sounds weird in Brazil
Didn't see that, thanks
I've edited it
France, Portugal, Germany and Hungary in the same group
Who knows
For me this championship can be sometime considered harder than the world cup, I mean, you can meet Italy, Spain, Germany and Belgium
I think I would be very happy for us to go to SF
EDIT: I just remember who are in our group, so I am not so sure any more about that SF
It s doable if we survive the group F
Probably decently
I haven't followed much news about football recently, but from what I've gathered it has been a bit of a mess
let's hope to be closer to 2016 than 2008
If we get out of the group I can definitely see the team win the Euros
In my opinion we have the best team by a large margin , the group is better than in 2016 and is better than in 2018 but this is only on paper, many things can happen in football
For that we need to get out of our group
We’ve got the best team and we won the WC
The team is the same and we even have more promising young players
If everything goes well we might win
I am not too worried about the group stage tbf, with the new version of the tournament you can end 3rd and still make it through
However I expect things to get tougher from the second round
Sincere question, has he become an idol in Portugal
Or do they talk bad of him, when he's disappointing (i.e. all the time except this cursed final)
Ice burns doesn't it
We haven't been playing that well lately, but a competition is something different, so I hope for the best
Honestly, Sweden was good when Ibra was still young, when he grew the team had some of its worst results in decades
That points as him being more of a handicap, but maybe he'll show everybody wrong this time
I love how Spanish sounds
Like, when Penelope Cruz argue in Spanish with Javier Bardem in Vicky Cristina Barcelona it's so hot
German for the beauty of its structure, Japanese for how  it generally sounds, especially the small sounds (onomatopees ? don't know the word in English)
If I believe some American people it would have been much more common without them
I learned Breton for two years in middle school
I don't remember much of it, apart from a swear phrase our teacher taught us: "kor pichen tom" (not sure about the writing)
It means "hot pigeon poop". xD
Not exactly this but I think Finntroll sings in Swedish
Did not meet many German people speaking good French but honestly I feel like most foreign accents sound nice
Having been at a uni which had a few French-speaking Germans, it doesn't sound particularly offensive nor attractive
It's a fairly neutral accent
Wellington, Trafalgar, etc
most British heroes aren't seen in a good light here
Bismarck isn't liked here either for obvious reasons
I'm not an expert, I only know a bit from Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast -- but my impression is that Radetzky was a very competent and fair general, who always offered amnesty after winning a battle, letting captured soldiers go home if they promised not to fight again
This is in contrast to some other generals of the Italian War and Revolutions of 1848, who severely punished defeated enemies and even carried out massacres
But obviously, I wouldn't like Radetzky either if I were Italian
Oh yeah, I can't sleep with the heatwave, I'm tired
Given how the French suck or are reluctant at learning foreign languages, I'm not the least worried about the French language disappearing
I'm more concerned about the poor level of grammar the younger generations seem to have, especially when it comes to writing skills
And it's quite the same for French, a lot of African countries have French as an official language + Québec (Canada) + Switzerland + Belgium + France
But I think the true reason why French isn't going to disappear is because we're just really bad at learning other languages x)
[Stilt-mounted shepherds] in southwest France
The terrain in the area called the *Landes* was/is very boggy, so shepherds were using stilts to keep an eye on their sheep and navigate the terrain
It allowed them to move around quite fast: one of them, [Sylvain Dornon] (fr) was able to travel from Paris to Moscow in 58 days
[Love the Zaporozhian March]
The Basque flag is on the flag of St Pierre and Miquelon, two French islands near Canada alongside with the Breton and Norman flags for such reasons
Anyone not answering "right now" is overestimating their chances of survival in any other time period
Clearly post-WW2, 1950-1980
Ah good answer
Can't say that I have been following very closely, but I know a victory for PiS is not what I want
So I'd agree with your assesment there
explain Italy then ?
Do you have dubbing jokes ?
It could be anything ! A character changing nationality/accent or simply text changing
For example in Tropico 5, Penultimo is supposed to make a "french surrender" joke when you're invaded
But in French, the 4th wall is broken and Penultimo says that the voice actors refused to be part of the joke and that they sent to Tropico a 3D map of Verdun, a picture of the Douaumont Boneyard and a signed picture of Maréchal Lattre de Tassigny
So, any funny dubbing jokes on your side ?
>For example in Tropico 5, Penultimo is supposed to make a "french surrender" joke when you're invaded

Really
Oh damn I didn't know, I tried Tropico 5 a while ago and didn't really like it, but if the dub is funny like that, maybe I should've kept playing a little bit more
In the latest edition of the Dalton's cartoon (Lucky-Luke) there's an episode where a rugbyman comes into the prison, wearing a kilt and all
I guess in the English speaking version he has a Scottish (Welsh ?) accent
In the French one he has a Southwest accent (Basque Country) because that's where rugby is the most popular in the country so it'd make more sense cause we're so bad at English that people would probably not be able to differentiate between accents
In French the pun when Fred loses an ear was particularly well translated as well
In English he makes a joke about being "holy". In French he makes a pun about having an aureola - which sound close to the French for ear-ling/ear-ish
(Not a real word, but it adds a suffix which conveys the meaning)
Asterix Mission Cléopâtre is also a classic in France
We get a similar joke IIRC
The Euro 2012 joke is a funny one
Our is truly awful
Somehow "MASENNNKO" became "RAYON MAGIQUE !" (Magic beam)
The legolas thing comes from the OV
Your dubbing teams seem fun
Yeah but Astérix Mission Cleopâtre has a very special resonnance in France
It's a symbol of what we call the "Humour Canal" and marks a turning point in french comedy
Same for us, he's named "petit coeur" and sometimes picollo
34 in France
You can't pass near a big city without see one of them
TBF we have a lot more people too
we have approximatelly 1 Ikea per 1,97 million inhabitant
Sweden has 1 per 500k inhabitants
Thank you for the account
It's interesting to see the differences between countries, although the continuing racism is depressing
Who is that "Europe" person you refer to ?
What
Racism isn't only a white -> the others thing
Western Europe I'd say ? Although I must underline that there is absolutely zero debate on that matter here afaik
I dont think french people would say France belongs to a specific group of country, aside europeans ones
"Western Europe" is very very rarely used in french ( Europe de l'Ouest )
France, UK, Denmark, Iceland, The Netherlands are further west
Or they will just say France as an answer
So you are between east/northern Africa and Southern Europe
I'm... Not sure we live in the same reality, or maybe there is another Montenegro which I don't know about
Probably because the North of France is culturally more in line with northern Europe / Celtic / Germanic culture VS the South of France which is definitely Latin (except for the Basque country)
We're some kind of a hybrid country, but so are others, like Switzerland with its different official languages
Kerguelen islands for example
It's super interesting, in a way, because Southern France definitely is Southern Europe in cultural terms - while the North, where I'm from, has a clear Flemish vibe in some aspects, and a Midlands mining town in others
I like this stat
The Açores are just in the middle of the ocean, don't talk about forgetting ultramarine territories if you just take one as your reference
Yeah but Eastern Africa seriously
I don't think so
It depends on the people
I'd say there's a narrow majority, in my circle of friends, who do take them off at home (so obviously I'd follow suit if visiting), but it's pretty close
Yes
First thing I do when going home is removing my jacket and shoes
I usually walk barefoot, or with socks
Oysters and a lot of sea food and sea dishes (like Bouillabaisse, Soupe de poisson) were considered like food for the peasantry
Now every tourist going to normandy will have oyster and every tourist going to provence will try a Bouillabaisse
Most staples of traditional French food, very much like Italy, are poor people food, except it's been upgraded a bit
Baked beans no
I was thinking of pain perdu
French toast is served as a breakfast dish in the US if I'm not mistaken, with different toppings
But here, it's leftover stale bread that you make for a snack more than a meal
In my house, we just put a bit of sugar on top and eat it with our hands as a 4pm snack
It's not something you can get in restaurants in France
And if we go really back in the days, caviar also was a leftover from sturgeon
In Paris, there is the [world's largest McDonalds] on the Champs Elysees
But My favourite is the [McDonald's  rue Saint Lazare]  which used to be an Alsatian brasserie
The outside is very unique, but the interiors are also great
[This McDonald's] rue Saint-Lazare, Paris, is an official historic monument
I feel sorry you got a bad experience
Should I say I am not surprised
Service in Mc Donald's is usually crappy, add Paris and the Champs Elysees to the equation, and you have the perfect storm
'[Le chant des partisans]
Resist
Well during each match won during the football world cup, people sing a certain part of this song, where there are no lyrics, at 2:07
"Ramenez la coupe à la maison" by Vegedream, the French song for the FIFA World Cup 2018
Le chant des partisans, maybe l'internationale and the song for the 98 world cup
Le Chant du Départ [ the French National Anthem under the First Empire (Napoléon Bonaparte)
It's still considered by many french as our 2nd Anthem
It's a revolutionary song, not gonna translate the whole lyrics (you have it [on wikipedia] but the refrain means:
>The Republic is calling us
Let's know how to vanquish or let's know how to perish
A Frenchman must live for her \[the Republic\]
For her \[the Republic\] a Frenchman must die
Every time this song is played, a Frenchman is starting a revolution
ahhh j'en peux plus de cette chanson
Dès que la France gagne un match de foot t'es sûr qu'elle va passer en boucle
Limite je préfère Vegedream, ramener la coupe à la maison
even your prime minister ;)
Yeah it's normal in France
Duck is life
We also use duck fat to cock vegetables
Rabbit is still quite common, at least there’s always some at my local butcher and though I don’t cook it myself I really like it
It’s very lean
I’ve had deer only once, and I didn’t think anything of it
I mean we eat snails, frogs, pheasants and stuff so it's not like if eating rabbits was unusual
It was in the past, but not so much anymore
If you'd do it nowadays it will definitely be in the countryside, not in cities
Quick story: my grandma used to have a pet rabbit when she was a kid
During holidays she had to take him to her grandparents to be watched over while she would be away from home
Once she came back, she learned that her grandparents ate the poor thing
She was devastated and ever since is terrified every time she hears about people eating rabbits
Is there anything we don't eat here anyway ?
About 10-15€/kg
Between 10 and 20 € per kg i would say, depending of the quality of the supermarket/butchery where is it sold
For example rabbit with mustard sauce is a classic french dish for the sunday family meal
Snails are fine as fuck tho, frogs are even better
My company moved me here
"Not wanting to be swiss is a very Swiss attitude"
hmmm
Tu l'as dit, cousin
I don't think we don't like each other
Many many French do love Italian culture, cuisine, language, etc
Si, ho visto e sentito questa espressione molte volte perciò usarla
Ciò nonostante, pochi preferiscono fratelli invece di cugini
>L’hai fatto a scuola
No, autodidatta principalmente
Sto imparando il tedesco al momento
Comunque, ho molto da fare per migliorarmi e molto da imparare
> Parte “usarla”, che è sbagliato, (è “l’ho usata”)
Actually, I wanted to use the present tense to mean it as a generality
Don't forget to drink water
A few don't match : Na (*Sodium*), K (*Potassium*), N (*Azote*), Sn (*Étain*), Hg (*Mercure*), W (*Tungstène*)
But it's not really surprising, scientific names don't always follow common names
The only ones that don't make sense in French are Potassium, Sodium, Tin and Antimony I guess
Tungsten and Mercury make sense but aren't obvious
Most of them make sense, they are based on either latin or greek which are the two main roots of French language
So things like Iron = Fe, Copper = Cu, Silver = Ag, Lead = Pb, Gold = Au make sense
Lavoisier was already calling Aluminium "Alumine" in French so when Davy called it Aluminium and it sticked it wasn't weird
Limestone is called Calcaire in French so Davy's Calcium isn't a problem
Mercury symbol comes from greek composed word hydragyros, "liquid-silver". Kinda like the english word quicksilver or the French word vif-argent
Old French word for Mercury used to be hydragure and here is the same Hg
Tungsten ore is called Wolframite, as far as I am aware
Lavoisier created some greek rooted words
Some sticked (hydrogène, oxygène), some sticked in English but not in his native French (nitrogène)
Humphry Davy on the other hand used to create latin sounding name such as Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, etc
and the trend continued (Polonium, Uranium, etc
A lot do as a lot of the elements are based on latin names
Carbone (C), Oxygène (O), Fer (Fe), Natrium (Na), Kalium (K), Cuivre (Cu)
Sodium (Na), Azote (N) and Or (Au) are the only 3 examples where the periodic table don't works in french
Most of the other do though
Most that don't match have or used to have similar words in French, like minerals
Hg was hydrargure in French long ago, from latine name
Lavoisier and co changed the name to Mercure (used by alchemists along with vif-argent, that is close to the name in many other languages) as it is a simple element
Wolframite is the French name of the  ore containing tungstène, Natron is the same with sodium, etc
It's the same in many European languages
Natrium (sodium) and Kalium (potassium) are words in French
in particular they're still used in the medical domain (where we use the words "natrémie" and "kaliémie" notably)
Azot = N because one French chemist named it Azote ("deprived of life" with a greek root) and another French one named it Nitrogène ("that generate salpeter" with a greek root too)
English preferred the later (consistent with hydrogen and oxygen he also named), while romance languages gang preferred the former
Except Spanish, of course
Lavoisier called it hydrogen because hydro and gennaô (ὕδωρ and γεννάω), meaning it causes or generates water
He also named oxygen (ὀξύς) because it generates sharpness/acidity
He thought the biggest trait of oxygen was to create acids
Yes they do
Of course there are exceptions, but just look:
- Hydrogène (H)
- Hélium (He)
- Bore (B)
- Oxygène (O)
- Fluor (F)
- Argent (Ag)
- Lithium (Li)
- Carbone (C)
- Aluminium (Al)
- Silicium (Si)
- Néon (Ne)
- Argon (Ar)
- Krypton (Kr)
- Xénon (Xe)
- Phosphore (P)
- Soufre (S)
- Chlore (Cl)
- Magnésium (Mg)
- Fer (Fe)
- Chrome (Cr)
- Cobalt (Co)
- Nickel (Ni)
- Manganèse (Mn)
- Cuivre (Cu)
- Zinc (Zn)
- Iode (I)
- Radon (Rn)
Etc
etc
>Silver - Argint
Gold - Aur
Nitrogen - Azot
Clap your hands
Argent, Or and Azote in French
Damn gonna love this language proximities
Hydrargyrum is close to "quicksilver", the old english name for mercury
Well no worries, I'm not quite sure about how "French" is Romanian, surely there are loads of loanwords etc, but I swear I can understand you guys more than Spanish or Italian sometimes
Well yes of course, you gave a pretty good example with somaj
( The French pronunciation is slightly towards sh like 'she' in English tho, but it's close enough to understand )
Mind you that my level on both Italian and Spanish are abysmal, so at least I'm not biased towards a certain language
It raises a question since I chose Spanish as a second language at school, but anyway that's another story ... !
Nope :/
At least not languages that are too close to French
But Basque, Breton, Alsatian etc
are doing better
There are remnants of regional languages but aside in Corsica they are not widely spoken at all
For example in my region of Brittany wich has a strong identity and regional pride, and while Breton language is on a lot of roadsigns and pushed as an optionnal language in highschool, no one speak it on a daily basis and overall very very few people are fluent in it
Most of people over here don't even know the grammar or how to build any sentence in Breton
I still have to meet someone actually speaking a regional language
I think they’re dying, if not already dead
There’s also Catalan
You did not extend on Breton so I’ll just add this: it’s been given a new strength the last few decades
People want to learn it, more and more
This means that while the different BretonS are disappearing (there used to be thousands of ways to speak Breton), there is a new surge of the language
Putain mais c'est incroyable, il y a vraiment personne qui sait que le Catalan est aussi parlé en France ou quoi ?
> Alsatian is spoken by roughly half the population of Alsace
Actually it's more around 20% and mainly elder people ( [ )
And, once again, the savoyards are being left out !
You wouldn't make your way in Brittany speaking only Breton
Dialects in France are not at all like in Italia
Talleyrand, the shadow behind Napoleon
He was great at diplomacy and knew most people that counted in Europe so Napoleon made him foreign ministry and so he negociated many deals sometimes at Napoleon’s behest sometimes against Napoleon’s own interests
He had his own vision for the future of Europe which greatly clashed with Napoleon’s. Napoleon cared too much about glory and thought the only way to stop getting attacks on France would  be to rule over the countries who would attack it
He was a military genius and was pretty good at ruling France but he was not good at all when it came to global politics, diplomacy and long term thinking
Talleyrand thought that peace would come from trade and mutual prosperity and that war was to be avoided when there were other ways to achieve your goals
As a result Talleyrand supported Napoleon when it suited his cause and undermined him in other cases
Napoleon has suspicions but needed him too much and never had him arrested
During the congress of Vienna aiming at deciding sanctions against France after napoleonic period, Talleyrand managed to get the big players on his side so basically no sanction was decided in the end as Talleyrand thought if France was greatly sanctioned it would bring resentment and therefore more war (what happened with Versailles treaty after WW1 basically)
Thanks to this France and England never again went to war against each other even though they were mortal enemies up to this point
Since many of Talleyrand’s dealings involved corruption and or betrayal he generally has poor reputation but I think it is kind of undeserved as he fought for a great cause and worked tirelessly for peace and prosperity in Europe
He did betray Napoleon quite a bit but mainly because he would not listen to him and kept making dumb geopolitical choices, allying with the wrong people and making wars when diplomacy could happen
Really little known: Adolphe Thiers (sadly it does rime with the name of another famous Adolf)
He was a monarchist in the 1870s and tasked with establishing a new form of government, with others, right after the end of the franco-prussian war
However there was a debate about which king to pick
In the meantime, Thiers as président de la République and others worked on establishing a republic which was meant to be temporary, just until a King was picked
But no king could be picked because of trivial issues like which flags to use
And Thiers, even though it went against his original political convictions, found that the IIIème République worked so well that he worked to make it permanent
To this day la IIIème République was the longest and most stable democratic political regime of France
He also has the blood of the communards on his hands (from 6k to 30k depending on estimations), and was generally viewed as a tyrant
Some streets that had his name were changed because of it
He is kind of the villain in Napoleon’s story since he had a notable part in the fall of Napoleon towards the end by sabotaging peace talks with Russia (on which Napoleon had bet a lot on) so Napoleon had no other choice but attacking Russia and fail
As a result it is easy to just portray him as a traitorous prick
All he did though was for a greater good after he realized that as long as Napoleon was both in power and winning wars Europe would never know peace
I hijack your comment to recommend the book « Napoleon’s master: a life of prince Talleyrand » by David Lawday
It’s a real page turner and gives a lot of insights on the Napoleonic period and what happened behind the closed doors of the diplomatic world
A tyrant who established a functioning democratic regime against his own interests is a pretty good tyrant in my book
The Commune is very talked up and is one of those historical points that has become a kind of political myth but in practice it was a revolt and it was squashed and it is nothing extraordinary in the general history of the 19th century and considering the incredible instability of the time it took place in
let's agree to disagree then :)
Sure :)
Most cities have 'Asian' (ie westernized Chinese/Vietnamese) food, döners, Italian, Greek, Indian, Thai, Lebanese, Argentine, Japanese
Authentic Mexican food is more rare, but you can definitely find some in Paris (not in the other big cities I've lived in)
I mean you can find any authentic food in Paris really, I know of a Tibetan restaurant, an Afghan one etc
Checking out just-eat (delivery website) for my city :
Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Indian-Pakistanese, Asian, Tibetan, Brasilian, Thai, French, Turkish
Plenty of Tacos and Couscous and Burgers
They don't really say Mexican next to the Tacos though
Those are just deliveries though, there's also a Brasilian-Antillean close to me, for example
I wish we had good Indian and Mexican food in France
It's unfortunate we don't.
I love Georgian food as well and there is a delicious Georgian restaurant in Paris
Je pense donc je suis -> I think, therefore I am
Lots of famous lines from Molière's plays have wound up in other media on account of how well recognized they are (e.g. "Qu'allait il donc faire dans cette galère", from Scapin, or "Ma cassette
" from l'Avare)
"Un pour tous, tous pour un" shows up a lot in popular culture, generally associated with Dumas' Les Trois Mousquetaires (even though it's technically apocryphal)
Descartes's "Je pense, donc je suis" is a fan favorite as well
Edit : Almost forgot this one : "Sans la liberter de blâmer, il n'est point d'éloge flatteur" ("without the freedom to criticise, there is no flattering praise"), From Beaumarchais' Le Mariage de Figaro
It's the tagline of the right wing newspaper Le Figaro, and obviously where it gets its name
that English translation is confusing the hell out of me, and while I can usually kind of understand written Italian, I'm lost there too
"Cachez donc ce sein que je ne saurai voir"
A "Tartuffe" is synonymous to a hypocrite
Yeah, I think Descartes wrote it in Latin first, as it was still the language of science and philosophy at that time
RIP la chatte à dédé and RIP our chances of winning the european cup
It's pretty safe to assume we'll be beaten during the early stages, as it's a common occurence for those who won the World Cup just before
But I'm definitely rooting for Croatia, they were exceptional players and deserve a big win
So I hope they'll have a comfortable draw in 2020
As a french I'm really happy with the draw
It's awesome
You have the euro champion, the world champion, and Germany in the same group
Maybe also Iceland, that would be cool
We will have a rematch with Portugal, never played against them since that damn finale in 2016
As of Germany it's always a pleasure to play against them, we lost in 2014, they lost in 2016, let's see for that time
(And I also live in Germany, so I like it, I'll be wearing my french jersey and get into friendly fight with germans
And even from a sportive look at it, it is not bad
Anyway, we are aiming for the title, so it is not bad to have such intense games early on
Yeah, useless to say, but our group is quite the thing
The weird aspects of the draw have a lot more to do with the "multiple hosts" things than the admittedly complicated League of Nations qualifications process
Même les troisièmes peuvent se qualifier donc bon
Je ne dis pas qu'on va gagner, mais ça ne change pas grand chose à nos chances en réalité.
ahah I didn't cared much of Bale, but since he pulled that "Wales
Golf
Madrid
In that order
" He's become one of my fav
It's common in the next World Cup, not in the Euro following the World Cup
Germany 2016: Semi-finals
Spain 2012: Winner
Italy 2008: Quarter-finals
France 2000: Winner
Germany 1992: Finalist
Seum Courtois will be back
but you'll lose against France again
Well, you've proven that you don't need to win a game to get through the groups (and then go on to win the whole thing), so I wouldn't give up just yet
Ronaldo is a fine player, but he really shines most as a cheerleader obviously
Yes in french it's called "Esperluette" and it's one of the most beautiful word in our language
It's "Esperluette" in French (I can't believe I'm the first French person to comment
"esperluette "
I had to google it, never head before
I love this silly word
Beautiful but never heard it before
We learn everyday I guess
Im french too but never heard this
Always called it « et commercial » translating to « commercial and »
Tu dois être 4ème ou 5ème désolé de te casser le moral

Well I thought that was the proper name
*Hey friend, wanna build an Alliance
Complaining
About work, food, strike, weather, people complaining
Sometimes I just want to scream shut up and enjoy !
Always complaining about everything
That's not solely italian
We have the same
I have fought my group of friends on this for the past 8 (9
) years, I'm *always* on time, I always told them how long I waited
I never got mad about this, just:  "Hey guys
" "How long did you wait ?" "25 minutes why ?"
They started to feel bad about it pretty damn quickly and after 2 to 6 years (depending on the person), they always are on time when I'm here
When I'm not expected it's still random time land, but hey
You would fit in perfectly in France
We have the same kind of people here sadly, the whole exceptionalism thing is quite upsetting because, like you said, it's stuck in the past, only wanting to revive a bygone era
And it doesn't really care about the future
Nowadays if I'm organising a dinner at 21h I just say to come at 20h.
We call it " quart d'heure Parisien (or Lyonnais)"
Or Angevin aha
We call that "quart d'heure de politesse" where I live (Brittany)
No, never ordered without onions though
The pet peeve of kebabists in France is that they all call everyone « chef » (chief)
It’s like it’s part of the job or something
I would be pretty embarrassed
Oh, you say "kebabist"? I say "kebabier", which could translate as "kebaber".
To answer OP's question, I always order them without onions because I hate them, and never, EVER did the kebaber ask me this
No I say kebabier in French
Same here, people find it funny because it sounds like a kebab tree but I like saying kebabier
Interestingly enough before 1789 Paris was not always the capital
Charlemagne lived in Soissons
The capital moved between Soissons, Orléans and Paris until Louis XVI moved the capital to his Versailles palace
But after the French revolution the capital remained Paris because of it's population, cultural and economical power
It is also situated in the Seine river, making it very good for trade
Well the capital moved to St Petersburg once
Why did the Soviets choose Moscow
You just forgot Vichy here: during WW2, it briefly was the capital of the collaborationist government
This is obviously a part of our history that we’re not found of
Paris became the capital agin in 1945
(Also, it is true that the capital moved until 1789, but Paris was an important city even before that
The Louvre was the residence of the king for quite some times, and Louis XIV chose to make Versailles his capital because of Paris -roughly
"Were you killed ?"
"Sadly yes
But I lived !"
"Je m en bats les couilles"  ~ i am slapping  my balls with it"
In French, the most common way of saying "I don't give a fuck" is "je m'en bats les couilles" (literally, "I beat my balls with it')
Young people will often shorten that to "balec" (written phonetically)
In French we say "J'en ai rien à foutre", which van literally translate to "I have nothing to cum over this". A more efficient translation would be "I won't cum over this"
Fuck yeah this is French
Also "je m'en branle" = "I'm wanking about it"
"J'en ai rien à péter", I can't even figure out how a literal translation would work, maybe another French person could help
Ça m'en touche une, sans faire bouger l'autre
"Je m'en tamponner le coquillard"
« (Je n’en ai) rien à battre/foutre/cirer/faire/branler
= I have nothing to beat/put/wax/do/wank this with
Maybe "I have nothing to fart about"
And "J'en ai rien à foutre" litteraly I have nothing to put but in a vulgar way (foutre is also a really vulgar way to say sperm)
If I recall correctly it was popularized by Chirac and made its way into popular use
Majority of french people didn't speak french before 1850
Half of the roundabout in the world are french (30 000)

*La Horde du Contrevent
I think it's been translated in quite a few languages
I'll go with "La Peste" by Albert Camus, which is situational
Try The Count of Monte Cristo, or The Three Musketeers
If you want something on topic, read *La Peste* by Albert Camus
That's probably the best moment to read this book
I'd also say all the books by Jules Verne
And to be more modern, like "La horde", but mainstream, Bernard Werber
"Les fourmis" (The ants) and others should be accessible
Spain isn't massacring the Catalonian people in response, the situations aren't really similar
Interference from other countries is also used as an argument by China (Hong Kong/ Tibet) and Russia (Crimea) for example , so although it's quite possible, I'm not sure that it's a strong argument
In Belgium they apparently have to vote or be fined
The scramble for Russia then ?
We'll take Moscow
It's mostly people with English as a first language struggling to find when to use the formal you *Vous* or the informal you *Tu*.
It can sometimes be hard for us too, but mate you were holding me while I was puking in the gutter last night, you can stop talking to me like I'm some royalty now
For some reason many foreigners know the phrase *comme ci comme ça* (so-so)
It does exist but I don't know who says this in real life
American tourists in France, who admittedly want to be nice and that's a great thing, will tell a waiter, or cashier "ça va
", which means "how are you doing
". But it's kind of confusing, because waiters, or cashiers and whatnot don't expect that question
So they're like "uh, yes, good/ok". In the end, all they want to do is take your order, or sell you your ticket or whatever
Not answer your question about how they're feeling today
But admittedly that's a tricky one
Because in France, people who do know eachother will say "ça va
" when they cross paths
But it's a rhetorical question, it's a way of saying "hello". But only between people who know eachother
If a perfect stranger asks "ça va
" (aka "how are you doing
") it feels like a question that demands an answer
In reality, "ça va
" is the equivalent of "whaddup
" or something
It doesn't actually demand and true answer
And you wouldn't say it to someone you don't know, like a waiter, or supermarket cashier and whatnot
Hijacking your comment, sorry dude, but I'm always baffled at the *"comme ci, comme ça"*... who the fuck ever says that here ? :D
Land of the poets
Na probably from selten, which would translate to seldom
Yeah, people do say "ça va
" as a rhetorical question, and you're not supposed to answer that you have problems - it's just a synonym for "hello". But only between people who know eachother
You don't say "ça va" to some supermarket cashier, or hotel  receptionist
You say it to a friend, or coworker
I mean it's very informal
It's basically like saying "hey man, what's up
". You say this to your coworker, you don't say that to some cashier
True native
Often accompanied with a fart sound that you make with your mouth
***Prrrt*** "J'sais pas" *shrug*
We're a weird bunch
Ehh, it's more like "J'sais pas" ou "Chaipa" (really informal) but not "j'ai pas".
France is not too big on nicknames
It does exist, but it far from the norm
How does William transforms into Billy, How does the W sound changes to a B sound ???
Moreover, does'nt william come from Guillaume ( never understood that change too)
Agreed ... My name is Christophe but only foreign colleagues try to call me Chris
might be my personal experience but again in France (not in french) we can use diminutifs but de just don't as a norm
Could have been Jeff ... But it wasn't
I spent 3 years in Georgia, Tbilissi when i was a kid (my parents made us travel for work)
Moreover I did not go to a traditional georgian school but a school for foreigners
All that being said i keep a very good memory from there as the ppl were all so kind and welcoming
Truly the georgians are one of the most hospitable ppl
Geography wise, it is also an amazing place
The views are breath taking
Also since you are surrounded by the Caucasus, there are many mountains and ski stations
Finally from a financial stand point, i'd say the living costs are overall pretty cheap
If they leave Europe, they will give a free monopoly to another company and they will probably lose users after several years in others countries because there will be better alternatives
An important information to consider that explains Facebook stance: they don't know how to operate without data transfer out of the EU
Their product is not conceived for it
They won't be able to do so in any short delay (or even medium delay) as this would probably imply to rewrite big parts of Facebook and may be even an impossible task
Facebook is currently conceived as one big single worldwide social media
You can be in the US and comment a photo of your Italian cousin, and viceversa
This means data transfers (to make it simple)
So it's not bluff, the only choice left to Facebook with current regulator stance is: withdraw from Europe, as the alternatives are not viable (they can't ignore European justice and fines, and they can't rewrite from scratch Facebook)
That said: good riddance
The idea of a single company controling such a worldwide social media shouldn't have existed
Perhaps next time we'll design things from scratch with interoperable local infrastructures that form a worldwide décentralized network, where everybody controls its data
As much as I understand the sentiment, we have to realize entire companies will close down if this happens
Thousands of people's paycheks rely entirely on that
Collateral casualties wouldn't be small
Fine !
harhar how did it get 110k upvotes though
All the monopolies should leave so we can create our own networks
Please do
Never getting on it while everyone wondered why has been  a bit tough at some point, but I am glad I stuck to my ideals/principles
> But let's be honest, those are empty threats
They are not going to leave Europe
And if they do, how much lost revenue and jobs are we talking about
Can't be huge
Can't imagine Facebook feeling threatened over the likes of France or Germany only
I'm all in for Facebook paying up or fucking off
Facebook groups are just private subreddits
Change my mind
I think it's candid to think that 300M EU citizen matter less to them than 1 billion Indians (for example)
They do make more money on us than on the third world
Just because we buy more expansive stuff (hence more expensive adds)
But yeah ... I'll be happy to see them gone too
Just not gonna happen

Macron on the caricatures and freedom of expression
He really nailed that interview
Especially when the interviewer said that "french laïcité seems to be oversensitive of Islam", to which he replied "I feel like it's actually Islam that's oversensitive of our laïcité".
Too bad everything he said will fall into deaf ears, or be deformed to demonize him even further
The entire interview can be seen [here] for english speakers or full transcript [here
The whole interview on Al Jazeera is 1 hour long and it's incredible, it made me really proud of Macron
I think the only available English subtitles are the automated translation from Youtube:
One question comes at me
Why, in the name of a heavy weaponized penguin, do somebody has to explain that
Those words on liberty should be natural and obvious
For me, it looks like somebody explained why we shouldn't take a poo in the street
u/savethisvideo
He is a clean cut politician with good ideas on many matters
His ecological and economic views on the other hand, are the most debatable things in France
He is part of the establishment and works for them
That’s what bothering French people the most
Still better than most leaders but we do like to complain
Let's not get too arrogant about this
Just a reminder that 41 years ago, parts of the UK, Ireland, Norway and others banned "The Life of Brian" and the Monthy Pythons received death threat
It was not hundreds of years ago
I'd say like many French presidents, he's been disappointing on domestic issues, but has a good stature on international ones
Can't really imagine having a Trumpesque leader because we would never vote one in tbf

I always had the impression people thought of French and Italian as some of the more elegant languages out there
the thing is that Charlie Hebdo is not making fun of ur faith
It is making fun of Islamist leaders using Mahomet as a tool to force some brainless guys do bad things
If Charlie Hebdo was making fun of Muslims just because they are muslims, the newspaper would be long gone
Same syndrome with Chirac some years ago ;>
They’re not obvious in many countries
For some, there is only submission to a theocratic order
I think it’s because some Americans wish they could elect him as their president, they say that in the comments
Muslim media has been pretending he actively supports the caricatures, that he basically insulted Islam himself
But yeah, this might not change anything as they can keep mistranslating and lying to fan the flames
Reddit is a private company, it's not their duty nor their responsibility to maintain freedom of speech

It's the foundation of modern French culture
They said French
You actually have videos of Macron speaking "daily French" which is funny to watch
He's not speaking Quenya or anything
This is how I would speak when making a business presentation (albeit probably not as eloquently)
He has shown that he doesn’t really understand the massive crisis that we are starting to face
&#x200B;
He is willing to shut down our oldest nuclear power plant, but doesn’t add any reactor instead, and the EPR in Flamanville is still not progressing much
Meanwhile, China has finished their EPR that they started a lot later
Less nuclear means more fossil fuels, so that meant coal power plants
In general, our nuclear sector is very competent, however it’s ruined by politicians who say « What you’re doing is very good » in private but « Nuclear is dangerous » in public
He could have dispelled a bit of the artificial fear that exists around nuclear power and never did anything about that
&#x200B;
He has spent milliards for show, like this plan to help people install photovoltaic panels : [
Instead of the 130 milliards this plan is estimated to cost, he could have spent 40 milliards on installing heat pumps in every apartment or house in France
A quarter of the cost, 10× more effective

It’s not specific to him or LREM (his party), but they have shown how little they understand about climate and how not comitted they are to even read any IPCC report

It's actually exactly this, it's the first sentence of the first article of our constitution :
"France is a Republic that is indivisible, laic, démocratic, and social

That, I hope so
He was previously in the socialist govt, was candidate on a platform both center (his famous idiom was "and at the same time" referring to left and right views) and not ultra-politician (most of his completely new party came from civil workers), and was elected because his second-round opponent was far-right
But basically he's an ex-banker from Rothschild, has some progressive views on social issues but very neoliberalist views on economical issues, abolished the main tax on wealthy people, and hasn't delivered on most of his social platform
He has been demonstrated against by the Yellow Jackets since end 2018 and his popularity went from 55% to 24%. It's around 35% now, but his mishandling of Covid crisis (with many contradictory decisions and communications) is in everyone's head

Whining about downvotes is not a good look, do you want to have a discussion or are you just trying to get fake internet points ?
Try developing your opinion instead of a vague one-liner, and then you may be able to generate more intelligent discussion
I'd also recommend not using politically charged buzzwords like "freedom of speech" or "PC" because that will make a lot of people assume everything about you before they even try to understand what you're saying
People use the subjunctive in daily life all the time
> i think it is true that our language is the closest to latin from the major ones
It's really not
Italian's about as close to Latin as French is (in fact of all the major Romance languages Italian is closest to
French)
Romance languages in general have had a pretty equal rate of mutation in relation to Latin (that is they evolved in similar proportions)
Sardinian is morphologically closest to Latin
I understand, but how did that make you hate french
French used to be the lingua franca but people started using english more and more after WW2 , but french is far from useless
We just happen to be speaking english here because Reddit is an american platform, and that the internet evolved to be overwhelmingly english speaking, but that doesn't mean french is useless in the real world , far from it
Especially in your country, Switzerland
I HAD to learn english, in school , just as I HAD to learn spanish then german
I didn't have fun learning any of those three languages at first, but with time and effort, I started really enjoying them, it got me interested in learning about the respective cultures and media they're linked to
Same reason why I'm now learning japanese
I guess being curious about the countries of origin of the languages you're learning really helps you to have fun learning them
I don t know if it s a problem
People just need to not feed the troll
There's no « Germanic » influence in French, or rather not any more than in other Romance languages
The entirety of the « unique » features of French (which are really shared with all Gallo-Romance languages, up to Lombard, Friulan and so on) are down to the Gallic substrate and the tonal reduction that slowly crept in since the Middle Ages
Your anecdotal evidence is pointless
Statistical analysis of Romance languages show very little difference in terms of lexicon between French, Italian, Catalan etc
Spanish and Portuguese are more outlying
>french resembles a lot a kind of vulgar latin spoken by the franks
No, it doesn't. Unless by « Franks » you mean Gallo-Romans like what it meant historically, rather than Rhine delta Germanic tribes
>So it’s natural that minor the distance is, more the language is similar
That's not how languages work
Linguistic conservatism isn't a function of distance from the geographical origin of the language
In fact the opposite happens more often that not, with the cradle of the language being the area that's the most demographically/economically relevant, and as a result where the language mutates the fastest
That's why you've got rural English accents similar to 17th
century London ones, why Québeckers kept habits from urban 18th c. French, why the Southern Chinese dialects are closer to Middle Chinese than Northern ones, why all the most archaic Romance dialects and languages occur in mountains and islands
>Dante even called what he wrote “vulgar” and it is intelligible italian
It's the other way around
Dante didn't write in intelligible Italian, **Italian was standardized after Dante** (and Petrarch)
Sure, but then what's the point in learning foreign languages since english is the most "useful" one
We should abolish all of them except english with that reasoning
After Napoleon's invasion of Europe, the most useful language was French, same thing with Latin after the Roman empire, and yet people kept learning each other's languages
You as a swiss of all people should know how enriching multilingualism is
> No it wasn't.
>Lombardo is a dialect
A dialect of *what* ? Lombard is a language from a scientific perspective, and any romanist will stand by it
Its status in Italian law is **absolutely irrelevant**, especially considering how inconsistant that law is it is
Linguistically, what's a language and what's not is defined by [mutual intelligibility] that's it
Not what some law says, not what people think, not cultural conventions
That Italy rules them out as « dialects » for historical and political (read nationalist) reasons has no relation to anyone but Italians
"everyday Joes" in the vast majority of countries on earth still can't speak english
Only the more educated classes do
In that sense it's similar to where French stood in the 1800s although I concede to you that there were generally fewer educated people back then in proportion to the general population which mechanically makes english more widespread
>laws are irrilevant
In scientific matters, they absolutely are
You can't legislate truth into existence
>it’s the parliament we are talking about, a parliament that surely consulted linguistic experts for years to declare which is a dialect and which one is distintive enough to be a language
I hope you're being sarcastic
>And it’s a dialect of italian
It's not
It's it not up for debate or something that's nuanced enough that you could make an argument
Lombard isn't even in the same *branch* as Italian
What you're saying amounts to the same as saying French or Spanish are dialects of Italian
>it was too much influenced by standard italian and the other neighbouring dialects in the last millennium to be a language on its own
That's simply not how linguistics work
A language doesn't become a dialect of another simply by « influence », as worst it goes through creolisation
Which isn't even the case in that instance
If there was a millennium of neighbouring dialects influencing each other, then Lombard, Ligurian and Emilian would just have equalized to one Gallo-Italic language
And it would still be distinct from Italian
Any idea when it will be applied ?
Wasn'it already the case kind of tho ? Like other than Apple pretty much all smartphones such as Honor, One Plus, Huawei and Samsung had USB-C
So Apple will have to manufacture a different type of iPhone specifically to sell them in Europe legally
what do you mean the brick plug ? because some smartphone didn't had a USB-A at the tip of the cable ?

TIL how "nom composé" is said in english
That is going to be useful as i have one myself
Merci, mec
We don't have "middle" names in France, that would imply there can only be a firstname, a middle name and a surname
Rather, people can have several "firstnames", usually two or three, sometimes four
But as you said they're hardly used ever, I don't even know all my siblings' names
In the south it can be quite common for your family to exclusively call you by your middle name, almost like a nickname
The south of France
You're right, more like a firstname and two middle names
Yes
Intéressant, du coup la plupart des gens n'ont que deux prénoms ? Ou s'ils en ont plus, un est utilisé comme surnom ? Je suis vraiment surpris, quasiment tous les gens que je connais ont trois prénoms et les deux derniers ne sont jamais utilisés à part dans certains documents officiels
En tout cas je n'ai jamais entendu parler d'un "second prénom" similaire au middle name américain
Peut-être c'est plus commun dans les famille traditionelles, comme la mienne
Je connais plusieurs des gens qui utilise un 2ieme nom chez eau avec leurs familles

Perfect business as usual politics:

See, that's why you shouldn't use metaphor to summarize complex politic issues
The good old "we didn't get the answers we wanted to so it must mean the question was wrong".
\> under the terms negotiated by Theresa May
The thing is, for that to be fair, you'd have to list out what those terms are
And even if you were able to list out what those terms are, you'd have to clearly list out what the impact of those terms would be on the average person
In addition you would have to list out potential risks
And you'd have to do all that in very simple layman's English and keep it all under a page long
THEN it might actually be a reasonable expectation of something the average person can vote on

Cherry on the cake would be our president (French speaking here) actually replying to this caricature by changing his Twitter pic for «  Majin Macron ».
Actually the most "shocking" thing about this cartoon is the tie with the fleur de lys (symbol of French royalty)
Still a thousand miles of what French cartoonists have done on him though
Thanks for the context, I was assuming this was coming from state owned Iranian media
He said, in essence, that freedom of speech was not negociable in our country, and caricaturing religious figures fell under that same freedom of speech
Of course, every holier-than-thou muslim started a cockfight to see who would act the most offended, and Erdogan, who dreams of becoming a 21st century Sultan, jumped on the occasion as well
It seems that it is easier for them to boycott and insult an european democracy over drawings, rather than a communist dictatorship locking your religion brethrens in concentration camps

Depends on the tie
A thin one will look like shit without a full windsor
Nothing does
Why is your first assumption that I buy shit ties ? There are plenty of great ties that happen to be have a thin flowing weave, even with seven folds or more
I prefer heavier patterned weaves that fit better with a half Windsor but I'd look like a clown wearing a narrow knot on thinner ties due to preferring slightly broader and wider collars
> A thin tie is a long thin width tie that's historically associated with a cheap shitty tie
I'm talking about the actual thickness of the tie, not the width

Praising cleaner vehicles is good and all, it makes Norway cleaner but the countries producing the cars get so much polution that we should wonder if it's worth it
Batteries need rare minerals, mined in poor countries using child labor and with no regards to the environment
The biggest mine in Chili that sells most of its minerals to car battery manufacturers uses 2000L of water per second
Minerals get harder and harder to find, and require more and more effort
Electric vehicules are not a viable solution at all
Producing those EV is very impactful for the environment
We shouldn't be so happy about countries going all in on electric
>We spend about 3,5 billion euros and rising per year
Scaled up to the EU that would be x100, or 350 billion euros
The costs are both exemption from the 25% VAT and from the other car-related taxes - so not direct subsidies so much as exemption from taxes
On thing that's important to keep in mind is that, because it is indirect, this "cost" depends as much on tax exemptions for electric cars as it does on the tax burden imposed on fossil fuel cars
So you can think of the switch to electric cars as having been motivated by subsidies, but also as having been motivated by tax increases
The first view gives the impression that the government is losing money, the second that the government is earning money
In France the core of the system is "subsidize cleaner vehicles with the taxes taken on more polluting vehicles". zero-sum

Macron is the new French president
Feast your eyes upon [our electoral map] !
He won not because he made a great campaign, but because he's not the FN
T_D learning about democracy:
Give me your salt T_D, told you Eurobros, we're not retarded yet !
Also, he won almost everywhere in France
Final results
Macron : 66,06% !
I, for one, welcome our new centrist overlord
The far right got more voices than 15 years ago
FN got 17
80 % in 2002, today it's 35%... It's worrying if nothing change
Proud to be french, and proud that Macron is our president
It will be a great 10 years
He played the Ode to Joy as he was walking from Louvre to the stage
Such a powerful image
FN got more voice than in 2002, its worrying
What ?
It's quite bad actually considering his opponent
You need to be careful with this number
And I say that while being someone who voted for him 2 weeks ago :
The numbers of people not voting are the bigger since 1968
The numbers of white fla
votes are the bigger ever
People clearly said they didn't wanted MLP as a leader, yes (and I'm really glad it's the case)
BUT lots of people also said, using these ways, that they don't really like the guy who won (most of my colleagues, and a good part of my friends feels that way)
do other countries not eat frog thighs
*blushes*
Mmmh he went from 0% to 65,8% in 12 months
His campaign was by far the best campaign out of all the candidates
He was France's preferred candidate by most reasonable metrics, like him or not
All of that is moot now, of course
He's got to deliver, period
I think THIS is too much asking :)
I doubt they're legit, however for a lot of people and abstentionists, this was a lesser of two evils, people saying it is 65% of people that are okay with Macron, no, it's 35% of abstentionists and null ballot, + more than half of Macron voters that voted for him against the FN
He'll have trouble finding a majority, and there will be uprising in the coming months and years from both far right and far left, if they continue the same kind of laws that they made the last 3 years, especially the laws Macron worked on were ones of the most heavily disputed by the people
I thought we were friends and that the enemies were the brits ? :(

If be happy to take the train around Europe rather than flying
But until they can offer international trips for €25 or so, I probably will end up flying
This is true
However, if you want this to happen, we need to change the way we finance the rail infrastructure, and this is going to cost billions
For now, building and maintaining rail infrastructure is supposedly paid by train tickets: there is a "toll" included in each ticket for that
If you really want trains to be cheap, the rail infrastructure needs to be paid by taxes, the same way our taxes pay road maintanance and safety
That's a consequent budget for our states
With an infrastructure free to use for any company, you can then open the market for long distance trains
For example, Easyjet should be able to span an Easytrain franchise and put trains wherever they want
They don't do for now because access to infrastructure is complicated and expensive
Like really expensive: to run a train on high speed tracks, especially in France, you have to pay around €30 of tolls per passenger to the infrastructure manager
And you need to reserve the track access up to two years before your train runs… It is sad but real: it's way easier and cheaper to have a plane flying from an airport than to put a private train on tracks
If you take out the track cost of train tickets, you'll have correctly priced tickets, basically
And if you have easy access to tracks, cheap private transport companies will switch from buses and planes to trains
You need also to consider that on top of this free track access for long distance, you'll want to subsidize some local regional trains as public service (the same way in your city, buses that run on free roads are also subsidized)
How about a simple, no exception, flat carbon tax that would effectively do the same
Transport of passengers is important
but train could and should be also far more to transport goods
The thumbnail looked familiar and indeed, this photo was taken 20km away from where I live
That and cancelled flights are not that common
Some train lines have such a bad record I'd rather travel by car
For example if you want to get a job in Marseille DO NOT SAY you'll come to work by train, for companies that means being late and even frequent no-shows
Hehe

I’m utterly shocked how the government runs this country and how so many criminals get away with their crimes
It’s always political in some way
like human lives are so meaningless to Trump
[Get me out]
I'm not even surprised
France is the real Bro
Denial and disinformation at every level ? Check
Politisation of the issue in order to derail any effort or sacrifice ?  Check
Morbidly obese guys protesting with guns ?  Check
Poor people footing the bill ?  Check
So, same as always ?
That's exactly what I thought when I saw the data

> generally good country (think back to WWII),
Ma men, black people were sitting in the back of the bus at that time when they had equal right in other modern democracies
I think you were at your best in the 80s or the closest to be on part with other's standard for "good countries". You had no more cold wars, no more segregation, developing and inspiring with new tech & movies
None of us is that far removed from hunger and poverty
This really made me sympathize with all who are struggling
Holy fuck, my city on the front page
insane
This happened in saint avold, moselle
I'm fucking salivating

Ah the dreaded aluminum foil blade guillotine
That's gonna be bloody
Every French household owns a ceremonial guillotine that we take out for big occasions: marriage, death of loved ones, big demonstrations
Belgium also have but mainly in the French speaking part
Not trying to be supportive of my own country, but the French aren't the only ones, basically the entire EU dig you
Even the Scottish do blame England for this so
I just married a Frenchman and now I fear my household may be incomplete
And sausage
Especially sausage
A lot of things, but globally, it's about the middle class always being the "victims" of Macron reforms
The protest are particularly big here in Saint avold because there's also a massive baguette factory who's going to move in Normandie, and people are furious
Christmas present for everyone I know sorted for this year
I will see you again in 12 months, kind Stranger
Ah ces normands qui nous piquent nos emplois !
I mean it's pretty much 90% of the yellow best movement population in France
It's a Facebook movement, hence the old and racist people

"Europe". Of those countries, only Ukraine is european
"Europe"
How is it an interesting fact ? You can be a journalist and break the law, I'm sure there are journalists imprisoned in literally every country
...a suicidal Romaniac
I thought the game was "fuck, marry, kill", not "fuck, fuck, save".
This is an insult to the UK and its unity
This is a big provocation
The EU is getting really salty to see one of its net contributors go away
I'm completely ignorant about this so that's why i'm asking
But if Scotland wants to leave, is the EU able to take them back in quickly ?How do we know if it'll be without issues ?
I'll ask my scottish friend about it too but she's not leaving there anymroe since a while and leave in France here
Not sure if she knows better .
MP ?
Who are the Warsaw police aligned with ?
It's not like she was protesting for a good cause right
For once, a politician stands for a thing in a country that needs it, and your first reaction is "it's refreshing to see here getting sprayed"?

Except they sold us out by renewing the usage of glyphosate for 5 more years, last week
Feels good to have free internet, but free poisoning for our farmers isn't.

Obviously wrong
It's missing one river to be Lyon
I can point out exactly where I live LOL
I'm mad 'cause it's true
But we also have lovely small villages
the more generic you get, the more it will fit any decently sized city you can think of, incredible revelation
it's totally Paris
This map strangely reminds me of Porto though
Loire fits too (Nantes, Tours, Orléans)
Also the ethnic food/area behind the hipster home brickworks

This is appalling

Really hope popular sections will now be good, and English class more attractive
Hopefully Biden will resume the customary US tradition of foreign wars
Classic "party over country" ideology, typical in the far right
This would be my guess as to why
Don't worry, we don't need Trump to keep Islamists in Europe
We do this very well on our own
All we need to do is continue to vote for our usual leftist and moderate centrist and right wing parties
We love our islamists
Have some too
Maybe your country can be like France and have some terrorist attack every trimester
I love massive immigration
> One of the first reforms in order is getting rid of the EC
How
That's the best tool, with the supreme court, that the GOP has to gain election
There is no consensus to remove it, senate might stay republican (or be dem by the thinniest margin), and they have more than enough state under control to block a constitutional amendement
Unless Biden announces a new constitution for the US (and it would be such an entertaining shitshow from here that is not worth the headache for the dems), nothing will change
I'm predicting that Biden won't be able to do any sweeping reform for the next 2 years at least
If he is still alive by then, either he will have avoided the feedback of Trump's economical policies (i.e. put the economy in overdrive, with an "Après moi le déluge" philosophy) and he might do some milquetoast reform, or he will be embroided in whatever crisis and will have no room to manoeuver
With how thin on the various front (Senate, house, EC) the victory was, he is condemned to a presidency of stagnation
That's at least how I feel it
I see this election as very similar to the one we had in France with Sarkozy and Hollande: Hollande only won because nobody could stand Sarkozy anymore, and after the election he turned into the least popular president in recent memory (reaching 4% approval rate at one point !)
I really wouldn't be surprised if something similar happened to Biden
Despite the number of people that see him as some sort of delivering angel from the evil of Trump, I haven't heard any coherent policy or vision from him during the two presidential debates besides "I'm not Trump".
Do you think that, should push comes to shove, they would stand for it, even if it means electing a Trump (since it seems like it's mostly democrat state that push for it)
Should it happen for one election, will it stand during the next one if it's more disputed
It's a tricky hack for a broken system
We've been drown in it the last few months
There was a funny formule from one of our newspaper (France 24), saying that unfortunately, the world was such that we were all temporary US citizen for the election
Now, what I wrote might be wrong, but this is just how I feel it
Oooh I was in Bulgaria recently
A lot of people are wearing their masks like that
I get it now, they are just copying the people in power

Looks like you got the same cloud that passed through Northern France on Thursday
A question I had fora long time :
When you have your car taking a bath like that for a few days, will it work afterwards as if nothing happened ? Should you try to remove the battery before it starts to be 'at sea level' ?  As it never happened to acquaintance I have, could someone please share its experience with these kind of floods regarding cars ?
La fameuse baguette italienne
TIL I spent 20 years of my life in Italy without knowing it
Thanks CNN
Heh, Americans don’t know where it is anyway
Roma  - 2025:

Finally you can have good wine and good cheese ;-)
Non
I'm pretty sure you can fit America and Europe on a map that has a normal angle
Fun war fact: Actually Italy waited for the very last moment to invade Southern France in Spring 1940 despite Hitler asking them to hurry the fuck up
When they did in June, the French Army was already in disarray in the North, and had only a token force of 60 000 reserve troops to defend the Alps, against more than 300 000 Italian troops
Still, the Italian failed and couldn't manage to capture more than a few villages in the mountains
I agree
It's clearly a hexagon
Source: I'm American
It's impossible to invade France from the Alps
That's why the Romans started from their ally in Marseille and first built a foothold in Provence
Not gonna lie, without Italian cheese, our lives wouldn't be the same
Maybe at the time, but right now honestly nobody cares, we love all our neighbours, German and Italian included
The very few people that keep holding a grudge for something than happened 80 years ago are idiots
Maybe the lead in the tap water already got into their brain /s
The French surrender joke is losing wind very fast
People are fed up with it
And they realize as well that France's military history is nothing to be ashamed of

Hello there
Are those only forests or does it include tree plantations
see [« Ne prenons plus les plantations d’arbres pour des forêts »] [Don't take tree plantations for forests]
Cyprus
Sweden : Noice

Yeah, but perhaps young sprouts of trees from burned forests still count as "forests" in this study
I mean it's still forest land, even if it's burned down
For those interested, [List of old-growth forests]
So in one way, they unconsciously protect the rainbow from the damages that the traffic could do
It’s vandalization, regardless of your beliefs
I've drove on rainbow roads before
They are full of banana peels and turtle shells
It is a traffic hazard
Not what I’m saying
You don’t get to vandalize public property to express your beliefs and people of all political stripes should understand that
You sir, don’t, which makes you a joke
I don't think so, to clean a rainbow you have to beat the crap up to the leprechaun at the beginning of it
I didn't know that old German dungeons had leprechauns ....
You german people are monsters
You don't even share the gold you got with your closest country
Shame !
We totally accepted it we even took initiative in it
That's bad history revisionism my dude
I don't understand how he could win this case
Kind of thought the whole idea of positive gender discrimination in recruitment was to promote women since to equal competences they were structurally disadvantaged from birth
Oh well, so long for Austria being progressive, I guess we're in the times of Kurz now
Don't write a memo about that if you work at Google
They just fear the backlash from SJW that could treat your company like shit on social medias and then you'd have ton of morons on the internet who could barely read a headline shitting all over your work
So they prefer to take the hit for a while of working with incompetent women instead of hiring the most qualified person for the job
By the way those are the people that claim that minority cannot be racist
Its a fucking disease
The woman you would hire would only have the persepctive of one individual, herself
Identity politics is stereotyping people according to leftists views about sex, race, age, sexual orientation
Stop doing it
What if the society is inherently unequal in that it favors men over women ? How do you make it more equal ?
Yes
That's the point of positive discrimination
There was a 0
25 difference in assessment and she was a woman, which means that she started at a disadvantage anyway, and anyone who is not a neckbearded basement dweller understands that there is no such thing as objective assessment of competences, and that it is especially meaningless in the face of structural discrimination
No need for hard work
I was born a white male in a well-off family in western Europe and despite being an average student I got a good, meaningful and interesting job
Never had to have a student job to make a living, and never suffered from material need
And I think that all of that is super unfair
It's positive if it can fix structural imbalance in societies driven by unequal values
The same way that positive sexism should fix the negative sexism that is inflicted upon women in our societies
Structurally inferior
Our patriarchal societies build them up to be lower achievers
They are told their whole life that they will never be as driven, strong and leading as men
You did address me about my grievance politics in the same sentence in which you said "Work harder"... Please use better grammar next time
And to equal class, a woman would be unfavorably affected
Discrimination on the opposite side negates the original social discrimination
In the end it's not about abstract theory of "discrimination" as an absolute concept, but its concrete effects in society, ie women are discriminated against professionally
I think that can be fixed further down the line, until we've fixed the early stages of discrimination
Alright, in exchange you'll try to read a book, and maybe think about everything that comes before a man and a woman are given grades
Just so you stop thinking that people come from a vacuum where everybody is given innate capacities on which to be judged, rather than from a society built on a specific culture that may favor men
Poland and Hungary
The "don't know" should be overwhelming higher
We cannot judge the quality of the political system of a country we don't live in
No, it's because you weren't the playground for two World Wars
Not intrinsically, no
Besides, not quite easy to make "better" comparisons when there's more than one axis of measurement
Thank you very much for telling me what I think
As you don't need for me to speak for you to know what I think, you'll understand if I cut that discussion short
Have a good day
I'm studying it in school right now
It's very interesting even if it's quite depressing

Amusing idea if both countries keep their independance and only cooperate on practical matters, but beyond Celtiboos, I'm 100% sure none of them want this
r/celticunion
United Republic Of Ireland and Northern Britain
Good idea, right
Has the great advantage that Scotland gets straight into Europe without waiting in the queue behind all the other wannabes
No, that’s a common misconception
The Act of Union of 1707 merged the kingdoms of Scotland and England, which were until then separate, into one kingdom of Great Britain
In 1801, the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland were united into one kingdom of GB and Ireland, which then became the kingdom of GB and NI in 1922
Maybe England could declare its independence from the UK
That way it gets to leave the EU and Scotland gets to stay
Can people against Brexit tell me why they think Brexit might be a wrong decision
Kind of oddly, I feel UK could keep going pretty well without EU
Don't worry we already did that for you

Everybody remembers the Bataclan massacre, but there were six attacks that night killing 130 people
21 were killed in La Belle équipe alone as they were just casually having a drink
The thing that will haunt me for a while, is that that entire day, I made a running gag of "Hey it's friday the 13th, something bad's gonna happen watch out". At the end of the day, my 13 year old ass was still so proud of his joke that when I went to bed, I still told my parent : "be careful, during the night you're gonna be unlucky, make sure you don't break a leg in the stairs
And then the next morning, my parents told me that in the night, over a hundred of people died in a terrorist attack
Meanwhile people are still denying that islam is an awful, dangerous, heavily sexist, warmonger and imperialist beliefs system, so such tragedies will still occurs
On oublie rien, l'ami
That horrible night, I can’t believe it was so long ago now
It feels like yesterday
I remember hearing something was happening and I assumed it was “just” a hostage situation, not a mass murder
My friends were frantic looking for information about their colleague who was working there that night (unfortunately we learned he had been murdered) and I spent the evening scrolling through Twitter looking for any information about what might have happened to him
The stories coming out were so nauseating
Reading messages from people begging for help was too much
I still can’t get over the horror of it
Some of these muslims terrorist were literally born in France
Get you fucking pikachu meme out of here
Thanks for the support
Asshole
You've doomed us all
I don't blame common people, I blame the beliefs system
But you illustrate perfectly my point : we still can't criticize islam without people instant poping out of nowhere to call you a "hater" or a "persecutionner"
How is that racist to criticise a religion ? You guys are using words you don’t even understand the meaning despite the huge implications and consequences those words have
Btw USA are a country of communities while Europeans nations are countries of citizens, wich is probably why in your mind Islam = a whole race, but maybe you should consider that your point of view is pretty irrelevant when it comes to such topic in Europe
Jacques Brel ne serait pas d'accord :p
Parce qu'un Mohamed de la courneuve cité des 3000 qui vit reclut avec ses codes culturels familiaux est francais parce que sa mère a accouché à Paris ? Le droit du sol est une connerie sans nom

You're shitting me, right ?
This is called a proof of concept: It's a concrete, physical proof that the technology for personal "jetpacks" basically works
If some inventor went to a company 15 years ago and told them he wanted fundings to mass-produce that kind of machine, he would be laughed at
If the same inventor tried it today, he could say "That guy did it".
Now we have a physical proof  that they work, and are reliable enough for long-ish (relatively speaking) trips, which means people will feel more confident funding them, which means they'll develop faster, which means they'll become more efficient, which also includes more eco-friendly
This represents all kinds of forward advances

It's an all inclusive formula when you have a french passeport but sometimes you need to get the laissez passer A38 to have access to this formula
If you are surprised, you clearly have not travel much and tried to "mix" with the local population

Ah shit, my administrative phobia about the laissez-passer A38 prevented me to get those perks :(

4 years ago today happened the Charlie Hebdo attack
It feel like it was so many years ago
But I think I'll never forget this week
I remember coming back from high school at noon and my mother told me that an attack happened in Paris
It was so unreal and I didn't realized what was really happening until maybe 2 hours ago when I received a lot of text messages from my friends and we were all watching the news to understand what happened and why
We were 16 yo and in a huge shock
Does't matter, as long as we have shitholes like Qatar, Saudia Arabia or Pakistan funding islamic fundamentalism, terrorists group will keep popping up
That's mostly an US problem though due to their conservatism evangelists
Or are you starting to feel too in the UK ?

You can be liberal economicaly and not the socially
Those two front are often separate
Everything left of deep blue dots is socialism for some americans

True
In France too we tend to put the orange part in the center

It's amazing how you can still see WW1 western front impact on population density in eastern France !
You can clearly see where are the Alps

How can you fall for this
It's too long to even render as a link
without going as far and though individual houses are indeed too land intensive, you can achieve a lot of land footprint decrease by living in 3 floor flat blocks with a shared internal garden
Increasing the density does not require for everyone to live in 100 floors tower

Yes it's a complete rip off but my parents are too lazy to get fiber at the SAME FUCKING PRICE
Also my Internet is not at all representative of France's
Ah tiens c'est bizarre, je croyais avoir installé AdBlock /s
I don't know why, but in my district, only one ISP can provide fiber yet
But I have another one, in which fiber is not available for now, so if we wanted to have fiber, we would have to change ISP and the procedures to do so are fucked up
So in a way, I understand why they don't want to get fiber
(on top of some typical "we don't need it" and "i'm fine with that connection")
It's pretty easy to change ISPs in France now
Free will even take care of everything for you (lettre de résiliation, retour de box, etc
), all you have to do is call them

Now we need to get the most people possible to realize how fucked up the law currently is
And can we please quit saying this is about memes
Nobody over 30 gives a shit about memes, and it's making the entire thing look like it's a bunch of 12 year olds fighting for really trivial crap, where as there's stuff that needs to be changed in this law which **ACTUALLY MATTERS**.
What a save
What a save
What a save
I love Europe
I want to know who in my country voted for it
How can I know that
Here, in a few days:
But you can already tell from the screenshot above that this was more or less supported from center-right to right
Strangely, it also seems like a sizeable chunk of the ~~far-left~~ left supported the directive in it's current state, and the far-right didn't (although a lot of Eurosceptic MEPs systematically vote against everything, so they may not be against this law because they think it's actually bad)
In what way such directive can be beneficial to the users ?
The people chose
Deal with it
Can we please stop making this directive only about "killing memes". It's so much worse than that
It was a manner of speech, but I get your point; message edited
Yes but after reddit heard about it, we hit an invisible wall where, because everything had been built on "memes will die", the message wasn't getting any traction outside of a very specific demographic
No it really doesn't. Why advocate for propaganda that is complete wank ?
Exept it has given insane visibility to the problem, don't pretend like there would be nearly as much people complaining about this directive if it wasn't for the "kill the meme" thing
I don't because it's against my interests
Completely
If you wanna know I wanna emigrate to England and live my life there
I just respect the people's will, especially as it was the majority
Except it's sabotaging the campaign against this, because nobody above the age of 30 gives a shit about memes, and for (most) people under the age of 30 it's pretty trivial, and definitely not worth putting in the effort to actually protest a law
There are other, better ways to simplify the message
Have you looked into their arguments _for_ the law
On reddit, where the vast majority is under 30 and is part of web culture
However if we want to actually fight against this law, we're gonna need to convince the public opinion and our MEPs with better arguments than memes
There's a difference between doing something out of the kindness of your heart and doing it because anything else is political suicide
Unexpected consequence: France and the Netherlands swap their flags
It looks that way, but it's consistent across all the flags
> There never was a unified Europe and never will be because there's no reason for it
There was always an Islamic empire and there will always be reasons for it to exist
And yet here we are, no Islamic union, a European one
> What reason would an Islamic Empire have to exist
In short, public opinion
Check this out (albeit it's about an arab nation rather than an Islamic one) :
"79% of respondents answered that Arab countries are one nation
44% said they are separated by artificial borders
57% support the federation of Arab states under 1 government
- There should be an Arab army to solve internal Arab problems
Yes: 70%
No: 20%"
Do you think we'd get figures even close to that if we did a survey about the EU ?
> But what's the argument for the EU
Independence from the US & Economic growth
I didn't say that the US tried anything or wasn't an ally
But not everyone or every country likes to rely so much on the US
On many aspects like data privacy or socialism, Europeans and US citizens differ
That being said, we rely more and more on the US technologically
We use Google, Amazon, YouTube etc
We have no European alternative for those
When we implemented our law for data privacy, it was enforced on Google thanks to the EU
No single country would have been able to do so alone
Without the EU, every country here would have been forced to do like the Americans
This is but an example of "independence from the US". And It was more about "maintaining their independence" than creating it
You could argue that this isn't important for poles and that US influence or German/french influence is the same
But it creates an alternative that is not China
That's all we want from the EU
A good alternative to the US so that we can negotiate with it or its companies, were the need to appear
France became the first team since Brazil in 2002 to win the tournament without the need for extra time or a penalty shootout during the knockout stages
French here, I love this meme :'D
Hope it lasts !
I'm so glad our flag has the ability to evolve everytime we win a WC
Can't wait for the next victory !
But
We were the OG tricolor
Viva La France Rouge
Vive La France Et Vive La République !
Allons enfants de la Cuisiiiine !
Good
As a Frenchie who lived in the Netherlands, I don't want us to win again in 2022
The Dutch, Croat, Japanese or Belgian teams will have my full support next Cup (if they qualify of course)
Your team has been amazing, you should be proud of them
You guys were great
I'm sorry for you guys
I and many others will never forget your Croat team
Croatia made a new fan today
Honestly the best final I have ever seen
I live in Paris and wanted France to win for the party
But I found myself rooting for Croatia in the end
trust me you don't wanna hear it for too long
([here] ) it is tho)
Salty
Both teams played very well but Croatia made few mistakes
What a World Cup
I don't think that's true
We don't have flags at home
I don't know why, but it feels weird to me to have a flag of my country
Thanks
It's true this week-end is a big one for us frenchies
get prepared for your mind to be destroyed
Pissing off the British with a simple, nice sentence ?
You don’t get more French than that
Friendships do be like that
Le frontières linguistiques du breton sont plus grandes qu'elles ne l'ont jamais été. Le breton est tranquillement en train de s'approprier les zones Gallo
Rennes et Nantes parlaient Gallo, pas Breton
Les panneaux en breton en Ille et vilaine sont un vilain non-sens
Most ferries to Ireland leave from Roscoff or Cherbourg
Seriously
With a kind of Napoleon as a guard
Is not as black and white now
Schooling in Breton has been allowed for a while (any kind of regional languages learning was forbidden in school until the 50s) It just hasn’t been a spoken and used language for a lot of people since the 40s. For many like me it is hard learning a language that was the mothertongue of your great-grandparents that you never knew, no matter the bilingual signs in the streets and the policy of the French gov today
To be fair most bretons don't even care about breton culture and language
For many it's a vain feeling of belonging they enjoy most , like say, Texans calling themselves proud cowboys  or something
It's a picture I can hear
exp(PERKELE)
I knew the look on her face [reminded me of something]
That what is happening when you abandon every control over your economy and have no choive at your industrial politic but to give it to a supra national entity vassalized to USA
I've always found that this sort of imagery is the most powerful anti-war symbol
They way it makes you relate with another human being who's been so deeply hurt in their flesh
Another victory for Seagulloraptor
Dutch squawking seagulls are the meanest in my experience
I swear from De Panne to Blankenberge they're blitzing toward sandwiches, waffles, ice creams, everything they can bring their beak to, I even saw one hopping on the beer case of some dudes, not even startled by nearby humans and take a shit on it
Surprisingly, I always found them way more mild mannered on the other side of the border, never saw that kind of incident from the ones in Dunkerque, Brittany or anywhere else for the record
Kibbeling is amazing
I remember eating some in Urk last summer
We took a little week-long trip to Flanders and the Netherlands as we wanted some change after being confined to France for months
We spent a few days in Amsterdam, went up to Friesland (Harlingen, Leeuwaarden) and came back south crossing Flevoland
Urk is a nice small town tbf, with an interesting history
Eh, it was a nice place to spend an afternoon
Yeah, I know
It is a nice place to visit, to spend the afternoon
But to live in, eh
Plus I know very well how conservative the city is
I can get behind pelting a fascist with tomato and eggs even if it's a bit of a waste, stones are a bit dangerous but okay, but COINS ?? Don't throw your money at the fascist he will take it as encouragement and it's a waste of your money
Throw useless things at him, like the Sun papers or Royal Wedding plates
I don't understand why people in the comments are acting like actual fascism is anything but a marginal extremist movement in Europe today; you'd think we're one election away from a Hitler 2
0 from listening to the people here
Guess moral outrage is one helluva drug
If it happened today, people online would be offended that he was attacked for his "opinions", and would scream "cancel culture" at everything and everyone they think lean left
I wonder what the reaction would be if someones posts "I'm fascist and proud to be" or smth among those lines in r/unpopularopinion
Well they couldn't beat them up through their screen, at least

Really ? I have doubts
It's one of the things the US is laughed at, with constancy, along with obesity and patriotism
>Norwegian students in the US unaware that the healthcare there is shite
Unaware ? Healthcare is absolutely something you should know about when you're studying abroad
Besides it's not shite
It's unaffordable
As I said, earlier on this thread, the US healthcare is ridiculed all over
Constantly
It's really hard to stay unaware of it
Something i wondered while visiting an hospital in the US
Do they need to look like freaking hotels lobby ? I mean in europe hospitals look like hospitals
In the US it's like they bring in fancy interior designers or something
I mean sure it looks nice and everything but when your costs is already so high should you really buy designer chairs ? And i'm talking about smaller hospitals not super fancy ones
They shoudn't have mentioned it at all
Maybe
I prefer seeing the glass half full
This isn't about Reddit only
>What I mean is- nobody (in their right mind) would make fun of patriotism
You're right
Alas, a lot of people mix the two concepts, hence my comment
As for the rest, no need to apology
I agree with you
For the record, Olivier Berruyer, the owner of les-crises
fr is pretty much a Kremlin mouthpiece and a conspiracy aficionado
But, as a French man, I'd this is pretty accurate (for one thing, the source - IFOP, main poll institute in France - is credible), and while the communists had a very good image back in 1945, that went down as the exactions of the USSR regime became known
French Communist Party was very powerful after the war and they had an important impact on the conscious of people
They put in place propaganda around the « 75 000 fusiliers » (75 000 shoot) in order to give communist and URSS the good role
But they actually only 25 000 people shoot whatever their political opinions
Source:  (it’s in French)
That's the result of years and years of americanisation, hollywood did a great job, yes the us was a key factor in victory in europe BUT without russian front and manpower it would have been "complicated" the result should have been more like 45-45-10
Kinda funny kinda sad when you know that the US army killed more French civilians than German soldiers did
They did the american way: bomb everything
Probably shouldn't have been menacing invasion and nuclear warfare too
It's really hard for a French to have a positive felling about the Brits
Being named in that poll can be seen as a good gesture
haha
&#x200B;
After all, they are our best enemies
Thx for your opinion, but have you read the poll
Come and See is a brutal masterpiece and has aged very well (unlike many other "war movies")
Did it ever occur to you that those young people and the ones not so fond about Americans are not the same groups of people ?
You can’t expect to say something as general as « French people ... » without making a generality of something a lot more specific
When are you going to understand that Paris is not the whole of France
Paris is not the only French city
Well, it's fiction, not a documentary

This explanation makes total sense for Norway though
No, which is probably why they had to google a (very) basic question in English

I keep drinking and being thirsty like 20 minutes later
God I hope it goes east towards the nordics
Sorry nordics, it's every man for himself
Well, historically, being born in spring was probably the best
I don't know if there is a real difference nowadays
This actually looks like a pretty bad example tbh
From that picture it looks more like a road on the outskirt of the city, which would be a pretty good place to park cars instead of in the city center
And what has the space been replaced with anyway ? Dirt and a fancier sidewalk ? Doesn't seem worth it
Get rid of cars get a bike, problem solved
Officially 3 now
New attack at Avignon, man tried to attack police men but was shot
Is 3 attack in less than a month a new work record
We have a right to blasphemy here in France, so allow me to say this:
I wipe my ass with the Quran
The more time passes, the more i find myself thinking we are laxist
We're too nice
Liberties are only worth it if you've got security
I'd rather have a pacified country, with strict rules (education, justice, police, immigration et cætera) than a dreamland slowly turning into a nightmare
We should enforce aggressively our values on our own soil
[The terrorist is a 21-year-old Tunisian who arrived in Europe via the Italian island of Lampedusa at the end of September, his name is Brahim Aouissaoui] (police sources)
Fuck this and this is only the first attack today, atleast there were no more dead (except for the attacker) in the others
Well I'm starting to think the lockdown announcement was not only for the COVID but to keep everyone inside against this type of attack ...
Again
When will this barbarity stop
Nooooo Not France Not France
There is another one in Lyon, an afghan tried an attack with a machete but was arrested before hurting anyone
I've spoken with muslims from the muslim world on reddit, some of them are so filled with hate it's disgusting, they say they openly hate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US and wish that we will pay for acts taken by already long dead persons
And there is no explanations possible, I've tried explaining that we are against salafists not muslims, they don't care they wish us dead
With such mentality I'm afraid that in the near future we shall have war, and entirely because of them
The future is bleak
Yes but I don't think it's limited to France
Any Western countries need to get this under control
Well
I should say any countries that want to keep their western values
By being silent and not fighting for your free speech is similar to losing it these days
Technically 4, some people tried to run over a cop and ram into the Israeli embassy in Paris
And 5 if you count the Turkish mob who attacked Armenians 2 days ago near Lyon
Edit : [Technically 6] a man was just killed by police after trying to shoot people and shouting Allah Akbar
One of the problem is financing this, people are in principle ok with more money going to education, justice, police, immigration et cætera, but speak of raising taxes and protest follow immediately
It appears that the majority of us is furious and want every possible drastic measures to be taken, including on immigration laws
Our fantastic and free country is dying because of foreign agents and a fifth column, it's terrifying how hateful those endoctrinated are
We have, since 2015, deployed massive ressources to find and eliminate terrorists before they can act, our governement revealed in september that one attack is defused each month but it's obviously not sufficient because salafism is supported by thousands here and millions in the muslim world
Our governement already said in september that the situation was very preoccupant, many laughed (if almost every attacks are defused before they are committed the population tends to think that the risk is over, it's not)
My opinion is that we are on a verge of an actual war in the next years
Too much insouciance blocked every actions that could have been taken before to prevent this situation to be taken
Now it's a more or less slow spiral situation toward 1990 Bosnia
Hopefully, people will start to understand that wanting to defend our values and culture shouldn't be called "racism". Something needs to be done or beheading people in Allah's name will become a trend
That's not the same as in 2015, people are starting to wake up
People are just sick of trying to accommodate the never-ending Islamic attention-whoring
It erodes the very rule of law that protects Muslims, but I doubt those guys cares
french people are angry and if they aren't they should be
There was the one next the the old Charlie Hebdo office
Ya it's Iraq I'm taking about civilised country
Until recently, when you dared talk about those issues, you were treated like a nazi
So, WW2 is to blame ?
I'm only half joking here
I agree so much with your reply
When you told it 5 years ago in France you were called "racist". Bunch of hypocrites
I already feel like i live in a dystopia
Is it too much to ask, that i want to be safe in my own country ?
It's not anger anymore
We live in this shit since 2015
I just look at the ways we do things in my country, and realize that you cannot accept all the zealots of the world without a strict assimilation policy (and even then, we should be filtering who gets in and who gets awarded the nationality way more than today)
We should reform our education, justice and police systems
We should manage islam more strictly
In short, we should reform a whole lot of our system
If not, it'll goes on
That's all
For what it's worth r/france has attracted a bunch of non-French people recently, so it's not fully representative of the usual group rn
Unfortunately yes, as there aren't any measure possible before putting people in concentration camps
I'm not saying that "muslims will take over", we're far from that
I just think there's something wrong with, you know, beheading people because they draw caricatures or teach what freedom of speech is, which are two things France stands up for
Ok, you're officially a moron, discussion closed
I think we should use another term
Putin-boys or something, because there are honest Russians here and non-russian putin fanboys as well
I feel a bit sorry for the Russians browsing reddit and being thrown into the same bag
I don't think Russia give a shit about the west say and the people who fired the missiles are certainly still there or in Syria
For a moment i thought French girl war dropping this head in front of UK
Shouldn't it be an older, rigid woman in a German dress pushing all the kids into a queue
There real question is, why France is reaching out to UK

Not a good argument since colonies like Syracuse and Rhegion were amongst the first wave (~750BC), while Byzantion and Chalcedon are probably in this map since they include the Bosphore, and both are from the second wave (~675BC)
Just like La Défense in Paris

The car needs to have some flames coming out of the hood

But Where's bulgaria :(
The white-red-white flag is prettier and easier to draw
Plus it is a symbol of independence
The actual flag on the other hand, as the comic shows, is just the old flag without the hammer and sickle
It is a reminder of soviet times
Yeah, it's just a little joke, but damn the art is gorgeous
It reminds me a bit of Hetalia
In 1995, yes, the Belarusians prefered a flag that reminded them of the Soviet times which where, in their heads, better
But the meaining of symbols change overtime
1995 was 25 years ago
An entire generation only knew Lukashenka, the corruption and the repression of its regime
The current flag is in their eyes the symbol of that
And the red-white-red is a symbol of independence from this post-soviet stagnation

These fucking bullies will soon put this blame on Greta Thunberg, although they are the bullies I guarantee !
It’s the parents’ fault
EDIT: According to the downvotes, parents exposing their kid to the public arena is totally unrelated to that
Parents are supposed to protect their children
That is their responsibility (legal responsibility)
You are an adult at 18 for a reason, before that, your parents know better than you and your ambitions
This would have never happened if the parents had put their foot down
>Her parents did what good parents do, they are supportive of their kids even if bullies are against her family
Man, I'm sorry, but this sentence is stupid
If my kid's ambition is to expose himself to the world, be it for a good cause, then it's my duty to stop him
It's not like we had PLENTY of child celebrity turning in a disaster
> If a parent locks their kids into basement in order to protect them, that's child abuse
Okay
> So if your kid is is becoming a world class athlete
That's totally different, that's a job
If my kid is good at a job of course I'm gonna support him
That's not the case here
> Her parents cannot be there to protect her for the rest of her life
They have to prepare her to the real world
True, they stop at 18
Yes, parents are supposed to prepare them, not thrown them in the pit
Greta's parents have not prepared her, they pushed her face forward to the Congress, the Douma etc
I don't consider being a politician a normal job
I'm surprised anyone does
> She threw and pushed herself and forced her parents
And how does that stops her parents for stopping her ????
I want to feel those good waves too !
Just want to put my french team shirt and go to Bruxelles have fun with all those kind souls !

No, wait ...
Nice one
Weirdly I'm pretty sure someone with a French flag would not have the same reaction at all
I saw someone having beer bottles thrown at his window because he put a French flag at his window in Brussels (it was when both countries qualified for the semi finals so even before we eliminated them)
As far as I know France is in Europe too
Oh don't go with stereotypes dude, there are some riot idiots in Saltgium too ! One day if you win they might even burn cars also !

lol
Don't worry, the German government is already fucking it up without external help /s
No they have to watch on you guys
You do realise keeping your nuclear plants would have reduced your gas imports and coal production while at the same time allowing you to use those idle fossil fuels plants for winter ?
Right now, [only 15 GW of your 120 installed GW of wind and solar are producing] and it's higher than yesterday
So coal and gas are 50% of your production
If you want a poster child for an unstable electricity system, look at Denmark
You're also emitting 5 times more than France today, which is ironic considering this nuclear/renewables switch was supposed to be climate friendly
Waste from nuclear plants isn't a real technical problem and it has never hurt anyone, it's a political problem
Nuclear waste in incredibly limited and is stored easily, that's why countries have been able to store it on site for 40 years
We know what to do with it, we can even reuse it in new reactors, but pseudo-environmentalists block every long term storage project so they can say we have no solution for waste
Thanks for the reply, it's very instructive
I agree all energies have drawbacks, I don't believe nuclear has more drawbacks than solar and wind though, since they must be accompanied by other back-ups, which is just adding problems on top of each other
Other renewables don't have as many drawbacks, including the hydro you mentioned, even though they're problematic for the local ecosystem and accidents can truly be catastrophic
>Question Energy Politics without seemingly no knowledge about it is the Problem
The Nuclear exit was questionably done, but it not connected to the Coal exit
Nuclear would also not magically solve all Problems
I agree but the problem is that, as a result, Germany is blocking or at least preventing nuclear development in Europe
Rules about "green investments", indicators about "clean energy" all have anti-nuclear bias
I would never claim nuclear will solve all our problems, even with massive investments, it can't be scaled enough to replace fossil fuels 1 to 1
Solar and wind would be even worse but none of them could replace the sheer amount of fossil fuels we use
I just think it's criminal to turn our back on the largest carbon energy we have for the wrong reasons
Nuclear is a long term endeavor, leaving it is generally permanent
>Who needed to be taken off the European Electric grid Denmark or France
It's France
And the issue with severe weather condition and the French electricity is nothing new
Who has the smallest amount time of Blackouts in Europe
It's Denmark
What ? I'm pretty sure France was disconnected to stabilize the grid, it wasn't the source of the problem
And of course Denmark doesn't have black-outs, it's massively interconnected and they have German coal and Norway hydro
If France needed to import 50% of its electricity randomly like Denmark does, the European grid would explode everyday
I forgot about this, yes this is a massive problem
But it shouldn't prevent you from storing future waste in a responsible manner
Was it in Eastern Germany ?
As far as I know, other European countries didn't have this problem but are still block from storing nuclear waste
>That's not a strong argument since only 1-2% of the total time that it could cause damage has passed
So are we gonna stop doing X rays too because they produce radioactive waste for centuries ?
> They block it because there's no one to hold accountable when it goes wrong
So it isn't a solution - it's just an excuse to shove away to responsibility to future generations
There are no future generations if we don't tackle climate change and quickly reduce emissions
Having a minuscule radioactive waste is a made up problem
Do you think buried nuclear waste will jump back on us ? I'm not even mentioning the fact that nuclear could be recycled in future gen plants, it has already been done in France for decades but it's not economically viable when you can just store it at the plant
I’m collecting pictures like this
If you know others please let me know

Tell us more, you have my curiosity
> But if we all agree with the convention, than technically it is not a medieval house
Tell me if my reasoning seems wrong to you
I understand your reasoning, but from another point of view, this house being built at the very start of the renaissance means that it is much more representative and inspired by medieval style and methods than by renaissance
thus it could be said that this is firmly a medieval building
really an historian of architecture is necessary to tell us if this is representative of late medieval building, early renaissance or something transitory
And I thought they were crazy in my town (not Paris) Tuesday evening, shouting and driving around honking and waving flags until 2 am or so

Fun fact one of the building on that place was contemporary to the burning, 589 years ago

How is it practical to live there
Is it well connected with tbe rest of the city, are there shops, public services
I am curious
This post can't be upvoted enough
Same for me
And it's downright frightening that most Europeans don't even realize it
Not really more than before
How about public bidets
We've got these on the banks of the Rhône and Saône in Lyon, not temporary here
I may have replied to the wrong comment lol
Came for controversy
Found consensus
Disappointed /r/europe ...
I don't see anything wrong with it

Ukrainians in Russia ?
When was this map made ?
Uh guys
TIL the French don’t travel
We got invaded again :(
> even Russia there
tbh, I was expecting Russia everywhere, especially wanting to visit east Europe, if you know what I mean
It is a recent trend
The number of US visitors increased more than tenfold in less than ten years (2010: 51,000 - 2018: almost 700,000)
Personally I blame Ben Stiller for this
Damn look at that sexy haircut
He seems nervous, he's so cute when he acts like that
I'd like to bring him croissant tomorrow morning to break the ice
Belarus do be cute tho
I didn't know Miyazaki made a real life city
Companies and government will use them, pay a fine when caught and lie about not using it anymore
People are naive if they think we can close pandora's box
Keep doing things like that and I will turn into a EU supporter lol
Edit :
And they should ban all form of mass surveillance and social credit score
That would certainly improve reddit
Also removal of public comment/post history

>Understanding the importance of maintaing the dichotomy of urbanism and nature, he also incorporated open spaces, parks and greenery within most blocks as well
Really
Because everytime I see such pictures of Barcelona, it strike me how little greeneries there is
I would love to be proved wrong
There is a difference between the theory and reality
>Now his work maintains practicality and beauty all these years, Ildefons Cerdà's philosophy and legacy lives on
That's just a very romantized description of someone whose never lived in Barcelona
Talking about the beauty of the architecture of a city that is covered in filth, sand and dirt all the time
All of this brought by the near by sea wind that where nothing blocks it
The beauty of a streets that looks all the same, full of concrete
Yeah, Barcelona looks cool from 400 meters high photo
That's it
On a side note, the old town of Barcelona is a beauty
I lived in it and I would completely disagree with you
If you walk by parallel and don't feel the straight street then there is something wrong with you
You are working under the assumption that the student knew how to draw the Finnish flag
We don't know that
Furthermore, even assuming the student intentionally lost a point here, your claim that it is "not worth it" implies that you think humour has little or no value
Many students disagree with this worldview and think losing a point in a test in order to make a joke is totally worth it
Where is that question coming from
Latin languages do as well
It's just that "polis" in this particular word comes from Greek, and there it means "city".
Hello gorgeous
Quite cool, this boat left France just a few weeks ago (on June 16), and I happen to take a pick of it as it sailed along the Seine river:
Get in loser we're retaking the Americas
The most important question being : is  it French wine or Italian wine on the table ?
French–Italian*  Base
Built by France, joined by Italy
One female
Ouch
why not both ?
Sorry but Germany is not wrong tho
(i'm ready for being stoned)
> French cuisine isn’t nearly as popular as Italian cuisine worldwide
&#x200B;
Citation needed
again the germans starting a world war, good job !
> French cousine was literally the start of modern day gastronomics while Italian is more of a simpler and more basic approach
Elevating cooking to a technical and artistic performance is very much an Italian invention
It comes from the Italian court culture, which set the tone for the aristocracy in the 16th century
But the entire restaurant culture and putting the chef in the center of the show is indeed a 19th century French innovation
At least it's not French Beer
Ok I don't like your pastéis de nata anymore
Yes , exactly, that was my point when I see OP was Canadian
Their statement is 100% true if you're from NA where the ialian immigration was huge
Rest of the world not so much
You're not wrong
I am French but the cuisine i really like the most is the middle east cuisine, especially Lebanese
I love lemon, the fresh herbs, the spices etc
that being said I do think French cuisine is the most technical, the most codified  and the richest, but, I don't think it has to be your favorite if that makes sense ? Like you might say bebop jazz and cloassical are amazing but what you really enjoy is hungaruan oy punk ?
I would argue that it was still bigger than french immigration pretty much everywhere
pastas are chinese
IF you look at cities like New orleans despite the French heritage they claim you need to keep in mind that food or architecture are very heavily influenced by the Spanish more than the French
I spent quite some time in NOLA and I love cajun food but it has nothing in common with French food
For Quebec you have to keep in mind as well that French cuisine became what it is in the 19th century, so quite a biot after the biggest emmigration waves
Hum
You're
arguing about pastas my dude
Deal
But at what cost
I am more pessimistic on the consequences of that deal
It is bound to increase the already existing divide between the "frugal" countries and the "spender" countries of the Union
Thank God the UK left the EU, this would've never happened with them in the Union
Shit agreement with shit conditions, it's a scam
Wait
You mean they came to term with that bullshit that was austerity
RIP erasmus :(
>390 billion of which is grants
This really sounds like they needed to make it "less than 400 billion". I guess €399
99 billion would have made it too obvious
Talk about horse trading
that's the european council alright
Because this isn't about Coronavirus anymore
I mean if you think the unemployment rate is too low just get a higher minimum wage
Easy problem to fix
The UK was king of the Frugals
Still can't fund it directly from central bank à la F. D Roosevelt, though
The Austerity isn't here to rebuild, it's here to stop the bleeding
The Enterprises/people are the one rebuilding
The blood loss in this metaphor is money
Trying to spend less money isn't extra blood loss
You can be against austerity if you want, but stop misrepresenting it
No, it's not extra spending, and no, it's not meant to rebuild stuff
Tbh, what did you expect from this sub ?
Thousands gather in Paris to protest against muslim terrorism
So you should expect terrorism ?
Really
That's interesting
Could you provide a source please
I'd like to read up on it if possible
And don't worry I speak Spanish
It's regrettable, but it's the same everywhere
[Even a conservative government in the UK doesn't do anything
What does this have to do with it
Please tell us u/AmeliaTheRuiner, how many people are protesting today in France ?
Surely you must know, given your post
You know the protest was against police brutality and discrimination in law enforcement, right
Why protests against racism and state sanctioned violence against civilians bother you
Thank you brother, I wish we had more Polish immigrants in France, though I don't blame you for wanting to stay in your country
>Killing human beings is the worst possible act in Islam
"Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land
This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter
Surat V, verset 33
>when you have never said once Christian terrorism or Jewish terrorism or Sikh terrorism etc
Please, remind me of the last time a Frenchman died from a Christian, Jewish, or Sikh terrorist attack
Sure
However, would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
Thanks
It is terrorism committed by muslims, in the name of their religion
Exactly
I still don't enjoy the content of charlie Hebdo but guess what ?I don't care at all
They're not even being "offensive" they just state their opinion and if people don't like it they can simply ignore it because it's wrong for them
If anything it helps to create debates and discussion
Like seriously what the fuck is wrong with these people ?
I HATED last season of Games of Thrones, may be i should start planning of killing the producers because i didn't like it ?
At the end of the day, it's their show and they decided to make it like this, i still hate it but that's how it is, it's not the end of the world
I get my exemple is not the same because faith is another story
(and imo, that's even worse because faith is a lot more personnal, no one should ever be forced into the faith of someone else)
I can't, i really CAN'T understand the reasoning behind these attacks and that's why i believe at some point, even some tolerants people will be really fed up and simply want some quick and destructives measures to deal with them
It's scary
Please elaborate on the logical connection between George Floyd's death, Samuel Paty's decapitation, protests and people's order of priorities
Correct me if I'm wrong, but that is a murder [and it is the qualification that was given by the Paris Criminal Court (Cour d'assises)
>28th October
Yeah, there wasn't a single dead
I'll ask again:
would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
that's the issue currently in France
I'm extremely uncomfortable with the growing general hate and racism towards our north african or muslim countrymen, but i'm also very angry at the fact that some of them (and also some Christians tbh) don't want to understand that their religious law or beliefs aren't above the country's law, and that if they're offended at sth, well they can suck it up, maybe fill a lawsuit or curse these people to hell, but in no way it is okay to start harassing, sending death threats or killing people over this
(last year a girl or a boy insulted Muslims I think, and while it was fucking dimb from her, in no way was it acceptable to cyberbully her and send death threats, dumb ppl deserve indifference)
Do you have a source on how many people are protesting in France today, please
To my knowledge, that is false, though
The trial didn't conclude to any form of "plot", there was an altercation near the Seine, and during the brawl Brahim Bouarram fell into the river
There were tens of witnesses, even anti-fascist ones
Again, if you have evidence of a "plot", please share it
I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong
You are deflecting quite a lot
Let me ask my question again:
would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
You have just proved my point, it was a murder that started with a brawl
That isn't terrorism
My question really is extremely simple, here I'll help you:
Now, would you mind telling me the last time a Frenchman died in a "xenophobic, homophobic and race-influenced terrorist attack coming from the far-right"?
Well, yes, because those are the facts, as you shared them yourself
Fair enough
But as a Frenchman, what I have experienced is the hundreds of deaths from muslim terrorism
Your points are valid, but you can't expect for them to have the same level of priority with me
On the one hand, you have harassment
On the other, you have decapitations, hundreds of people shot down, people run over by trucks at the beach
I'm sorry man, I understand what you're saying but you fail to see that muslim terrorism has been a particularly and uniquely gruesome type of violence that has struck my country for the past five years
Far-right violence is a problem, for sure
But it hasn't caused a single death
For me, the priority is clear, it is dealing with muslim terrorism

guys, I think if you look closely it perfectly matches the area of France ! surely not a coincidence
Ça va ?

Merci :)

Ah, I see you're a man of Culture as well and you like the C.R.A.S. (pronounced crasse)
It would actually, we have territories that are French outside of the metropolitan France
Per capita means "per person". While "per 1000 people" is commonly used in statistical reporting, it's not the same as "per capita".

As a guy living in the South of France, I've always known summers above 30°C (35+ in July/August) and I've always hated how hot it is, I'm glad to see everybody around Europe feels the same about this stupid heat
Is it only me but the black guy at the back has his ass out
Welp my bad
3 years later, the French sent the first cat [Félicette] into space and back
It was an amazing time for space
In the space (!) of 3 years, 3 nations sent mammals to space and returned them safely
When did they stop
Oh you mean sending humans in space
I am no specialist, but I think it was considered too expensive and the French space agency concentratd on missiles and satellites in the late 60s.
In French you can also use Hebrew, Latin and Greek, but yes Chinese is probably the most used form
France also may use "c'est de l'hébreu" It's Hebrew to me, even though "c'est du chinois" is way more popular
Well, It might come from the fact that for many years French were making no effort to learn anything than French
We made French the official language of many things like the Olympics
Inland, most of Frenchmen were not educated to learn foreign languages until some decades ago
My parents learnt a bit of English and German, but would not be able to have a conversation or listen to a movie in English; and for my grand parents, only one knows English because of his job
Ask someone from UK trying to export to Europe goods, they are dealing with French customs barely speaking English for paperwork,it's a nightmare

All but the most naïve at the EU Commission knows this disastrous law isn't going to help content creators
It's a cash grab by entertainment companies who take advantage of the naïvete of content creators
Anyone remember TLC, the best-selling girl band of all time in the 90s? Their record company made millions
[They earned pennies and declared bankruptcy] The industry is rife with stories like this
Hell, Warner Music would still be forcing parents to take down videos of their kids singing Happy Birthday [if they hadn't agreed to pay up in the class action lawsuit against them]

I have a lot of very non-racist friends in the UK who voted for Brexit

Meanwhile, the solution to this problem is so hideously expensive that [Facebook is building dedicated hardware to filter content] There's no way small businesses can do this
All of the propaganda the EU Commission has been pushing about this is a lie
I'm still sitting here, devastated, knowing this business I was building is over
I am so mad at the EU right now

Well It's Big Corps that won either way anyway, it doesn't matter
Tough anything that weakens Google and Facebook is good, let's see how it's implemented before screaming
Also, fuck google and their ridiculous lobbying, using Youtube and schilling as weapons against it
At least before you could blame them for being too old and out of touch to understand subject like that ....but like, these guys are probably in their 50's, so that mean they were probably 20/25yo when the whole internet thing was booming and yet they give us this crap, smh
The EU really wants to lose the trust our generation gave them
They like to act like the consumer protector but in reality they are just protecting their wallet
Ah fuck, i can't believe you've done this
> I care about the Internet as the place where you are able to put your ideas
Well if it's *your* ideas then you're the copyright owner so no need to panic
That won't be affcted
And as per the EU Parliament's press release :
> * Some uploaded material, such as memes or GIFs, now specifically excluded from directive
> * Hyperlinks to news articles, accompanied by “individual words or very short extracts”, can be shared freely
To be fair, I doubt there is one MEP that never selled out on any matter
Plus wouldn't people who have voted against the directive also sold out ? Just to other companies
I'm sure the Internet giants were on the other side of this lobbying battle
Shit what did we do
> it would not surprise me if the use a geo-block (then VPN will be needed)

You forgot the one alone bottom right
We have this every winter in Quebec, with wind it goes below -40°C and it is frigging cold
Kids still go to school, people go to work with their cars, etc
Life goes on
That's barely hot by summer standard
I'd take -40°C over +40°C any day of the week
At some point there's nothing you can do about the heat, while you can decently isolate and fight the cold
To be fair, I love mayonnaise and mustard but I wouldn't buy these cheap brands either

They have their place
That place is called the trash can

Granted most of it is probably mostly due to the media treatment of brexit; but it still looks pathetic and
Honestly completly pointless
Because despite following brexit from the start and being very close to a few brits myself, I still can't tell what all that was for
Honestly, everyone deserves to live in a free democracy
It's an interesting point of view
Why don't you think it's possible
Do you think that it's possible to "save" new democracies with education
dw we are beating records in France too
It is everywhere in France, and actually pretty much respected
Summer ended
Could be a weather factor
Meh
It is in grocery stores but not really outside even when there is a big density of people
Drove past restaurants yesterday and it was pretty packed with people not wearing masks
Maybe that's because you're a penguin and you don't have any permanent population on your island
What is the actual number in Sweden
The one Google says seems too low (just over 100k)
That's because you can't wear a mask when you're eating
yeah so ? Eating doesn't make you less likely to catch a virus
Maybe don't go stuff your face and cram yourself in a restaurant when there is a deadly pandemic going on ?
Is your government still convinced herd immunity is the way
I mean, you'll need much more aggressive numbers to achieve that
At this point prolly just turn around try to do the opposite
Given the culture, I think Sweden would actually be good at containing it
> The point is that the problem isn't that people at the restaurant aren't wearing masks, it's that people are at restaurants at all
It wouldn't make sense to be at the restaurant with a mask always on
Restaurant owners were supposed to distance people more
They did at first but from what i've seen it's no longer the case
Thank you
I find this believable
It's never too late to come out officially and clearly to state the right thing
That's exactly what I'm saying
Spain does not want herd immunity but it effortlessly achieved greater number than Sweden's, largely because of culture
If your government asks for lockdown many people will comply and you will do well at containing this
The only people that want to stop brexit now are brits, other countries are sick of their sh*t
It's smaller than I thought
With most of the population living on the eastern coast that must be quite densely packed
You can take it both ways
Japan is about the same area as the UK or Italy, that's not a lot

From the rest of the tourist info I have, a lot of the smaller interesting places were dotted around here and there and would have required a car or much longer bike ride to get to
Not an issue

I hope Le Pen now crawls back into the hole she came from
Shame on you Trump supporters for trying to influence our election

5%. That is rather good
We go vote, but if Le Pen is under 35%, you should make French the other official language of /r/Europe
HON HON HON !
You convinced me to vote
I voted for MLP
VOTED, not my first choice but better than the alternative
I hope and wish that Europeans and others make a toast/have a drink tonight, when the victor is announced
I'm gonna go vote now
It seems for now, that there is going to be the same turnout as two weeks ago, which is good
The Presidential Election is the moment where french people feel the most empowered, the only time their opinion really matters
*Bonne Journée*
Frog here, coucou
Yes we know here that this is a huge day for France and a huge day for Europe
This election has been an intense time and with the American election it seems that the whole world has been caught up in the drama since early 2016
We've been on a roller coaster for almost a year now and today is the day where it will all end for some time, at least for me
We have a candidate here who has the potential to destroy France which is already in a fragile state
With our massive youth unemployment, terrorist attacks, riots and civil unrest, many of us here in France have felt a heaviness in our society
Today could be the day where it all ends and like you said, this is the day that Europe needs all French people to get out and vote to ensure that that one monster does not become president
So today I will be doing my part to ensure the survival of my beautiful country by going out and voting for Marine Le Pen
Thank you so much for the reminder
Does OP expect more people to vote after this kind of post

Belgian media now say Macron is above 60% (exit polls)
8:30/9:00 pm local time
> Actually with our dumb system many people were already voting for their second choice in the first round
Which is why I think polls are a threat to democracy in this country
You should vote for the candidate that fits your view not for a candidate solely because he is most likely to win
Seriously almost **half** of Macron's votes were "useful votes", that's depressing
Oh, you
> After all, you're the birthplace of equality
The same way you are the land of freedom
Wait ... oh ...
I'm glad you came from the future to tell us how the Macron presidency went

If there is one thing were I trust everyone of my presidents, it's the food and drinks
I'll never taste your coffee Finland, I don't trust it no more
Macron is the best
So proud of him
That'd be nice, it'd give him one less occasion to insult us from another country
I mean, I would support that
They aren't many country where it's easy to find good coffee, that would be neat
Still as long as such regulations aren't existing, I'll never drink any in Finland, if what they serves to the president made him react like that, I don't wanna know what they'd give me "random French dude n°5739". *Shivers*
The 300 French nukes are flying towards Finland, Macron explain "We can't let that go, if their coffee has this taste what else could they do ?"
Funnily enough, these days Italian espresso is considered very over-roasted and over-rated, and in the specialty coffee arena Nordic lightly roasted coffee reigns supreme, especially from Norway and Sweden
NEIN, I'll defend Italy on this one !
If there is one thing were you can trust French president it's food and drink, this face, it's a face that just saw the void, not one delighted by the pleasure of a good coffee !
Russian flair checks out

Nice, I wish more people have balls to do this
It's made by architects for architects
It would've been lame AF if it was a conventionally good looking building
Also a lot of people really struggle with old x new combinations
The renovation of Le Louvre with the pyramid generated a HUGE backlash at first and now it's one of Paris' most iconic buildings loved by the majority of people
Personally I'd take a bold project over a "good looking" one any day
One will always stand out and one will be completely forgotten in about 10 years
The first one is great for both publicity and the identity of the building as an art piece
The second one is good for short term public opinion
LMAO

Love it
Well I guess the Ottomans were used to getting trash-talked by their european friends already :
> Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan
> O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself
What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse
The devil shits, and your army eats
Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons
We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee
Fuck thy mother
> Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, [Podolian] thief, [catamite] of Tartary, hangman of [Kamyanets] and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick
Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow
Screw thine own mother
> So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife
You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians
Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord
The day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse
There is no genocide of the Uyghurs in China
Only reeducation of people showing ties to right-wing extremism and ISIS

, thought it was worth a shot
I guess bombing muslim countries for no reason is better than actually arresting extremists
yeah i used that pic as a wallpaper for years :D
The treaty of versailles being unfair is typical /r/badhistory material
/r/askhistorians has many threads where actual historians explain that the treaty of Versailles left france worst off against germany
It is easy to understand actually : if thz treaty of Versailles was so crippling, how germany did manage to become so strong by 1939 ? The answer is simple : it wasn't really that harsh
Also, it didn't cost the hyperinflation of the 20s, the weimar republic triggered actually the hyperinflation in a political play to escape paying reparations altogether
edit : added sources :
good /r/badhistory material
Now for material from actual historians :
I will not hear about this is the future

Plenty of french politicians bike ,ride the tram or the train
but sure, France bad, rest of Europe good
Typical self-hating behavior
Ah so you admit that french politicians do it, just not ministers
because of safety reasons
Taubira biking to work in front of cameras actually cost more in security services and safeguarding travel plans, than her simply getting in her car
But plenty of national politicians bike or ride public transportations all the time , MPs, mayors
all kinds of politicians
My comment is futile, but as a french and an european I'm so glad you, the irish people, are not left alone during this sad moment for the europe unity

But when you post pictures online where you face, tits, and workplace are visible, in a place where they're available to everybody, don't expect it to remain a secret

Yeah we need to look very hard at those pictures of her with her tits out at the office to make sure it's really pics of her with her tits out at the office
She posted those publicly on the internet
Unless someone hacked her devices to get those pictures, I say they're fair game
Cyprus over there not giving a damn, just burning all  the oil
France has had a FULL NUCLEAR policy for decades, it's rather interesting
Well aren't you basically swapping nuclear for (other) renewables and letting coal be (mostly)
Its more because of the fact that they are a small island and less because of them not wanting to
Look at Malta
Same geographical challenges, same energy graph
And I wish we would keep it for a while longer
How did you guys vote for the europpean elections ?
I know, right ? I'm very "Green" politically, but we shouldn't consider nuclear energy an enemy
We need to get rid of the rest of our fossile fuel consumption, fix our god awful Power Plants and then slowly switch that Nuclear power to renewable
Living in Rhone-Alpes too, I'm kinda scared of all the old plants around
If only our "green" party was pushing for sane policies instead of spouting bullshit and conspiracy theories
But it keeps getting more popular, so I guess their formula is working
I'm suprised to see that germany isn't more obese than France, they tend to eat much larger quantities than us and yet they manage to stay slim
I guess they eat much more healthy food and exercice more
Obesity's not only a problem of eating bad food
It can also be linked with depression and anxiety
Maybe italie does, indeed, have better eating habits, but also, they might've sociological factors that set them in a healthy mental state
What's the criteria for being «obese»
I didn't imagine there were so many obeses in the UK
I consider myself fat for a Frenchman, and my BMI is 24
English breakfast is super health
Obesity makes you higher at risk of dying of Covid if you're infected
Thankfully, italie's in the lower end, it could've worsen their already bad situation
Nothing wrong with cerals, as long as you don't eat more than 30-45 grams per serving
Well we don't have an obesity problem bc most people eat healthy and varied, we also exercise a lot
The french know how to cook, that's the difference with the brits
Oh yeah, good point, I forgot that we litteraly eat a baguette everyday, so that must defenitly help to even things out
Lol
>Siesta is great on weekends, though
Also, I think it's a good thing, not something it makes you get fatter
I'm not sure
Just some examples:
[Loredo, José S., et al
"Sleep patterns and obesity: Hispanic community health study/study of Latinos Sueño Ancillar study
" Chest 156
2 (2019): 348-356
"In a population of young to older adult Hispanic/Latino subjects, we  found an inverse linear association between sleep duration and the  prevalence of obesity
Daytime napping was strongly associated with greater adiposity
Interventional and longitudinal studies are needed to better understand  how abnormal sleep patterns contribute to the obesity epidemic
[Chen, Mengxue, et al
"Associations between nocturnal sleep duration,  midday nap duration and body composition among adults in Southwest  China
" PloS one 14

[Papandreou, Christopher, et al
"Long Daytime Napping Is Associated with  Increased Adiposity and Type 2 Diabetes in an Elderly Population with  Metabolic Syndrome

"Participants napping ≥90 min had a higher prevalence of T2D (PR 1

Significant positive associations with BMI and WC (waist circumference) were found in those  participants napping ≥30 min as compared to those napping 5 to <30  min per day
The findings of this study suggest that longer daytime  napping is associated with higher T2D prevalence and greater adiposity  measures in an elderly Spanish population at high cardiovascular risk

Eh, I love white bread

I'd love to have something that answers the pyramid of the Louvre
Some glass structure would be perfect
It do feels that we are 7 person on Earth to want something more for the reconstruction
Thankfully for us, you're not in charge of the reconstruction
They will turn notre dame into a mcdo and the Eiffel tower into a Burger King, I warned you
Fire already vandalized it
The only thing that could make it worse is if we made some fake ancient stuff to fix it
I don't want france to turn into a plastic museum
We are a country of avant-garde
People reacted like you when we built the Eiffel tower or the Louvre pyramid, but history showed that being bold is what makes things great
I love how Reddit is quick to blame "far-right" parties when the very Muslim immigrants these parties usually oppose are the most likely to deny the Holocaust
I guess it’s easier to blame White people than blame Brown immigrants and thus give credit to those "evil right-wing parties".
Edit: what the responses to my comment have shown me is that many so-called leftists today don’t really adhere to left-wing morality
Instead, they’ve become lobbyists on behalf of some ethnic groups
These responses have also shown me that people will deny statistical facts whenever they contradict their beliefs or interpret them in a way that suits them
I have lived in Arab countries and am myself the child of “Brown” immigrants to France
I know what I’m talking about
I also find it interesting that so many Europeans are unable to fathom the existence of a society, so different from theirs, that what they think is a given, like the Holocaust happening, wouldn’t be as such
What
Outlawing holocaust denial doesn't make people admit that the holocaust happened
How
I don’t disagree
I just find it off that people here are quick to blame the White Man without ever putting any blame of the Brown Man
And you can bet 90% of them are anti-semites
Just like in all Arab countries where Holocaust denial ranges anywhere from 70% to 90%.
The world is also nuanced
I do understand that "native" Italians too are to blame, most of which would vote for far-right but also far-left parties
Exactly
This religion is given some kind of protected status no other religion enjoys
Yes, which is my point exactly
I do, which is my point
Keep making assumptions to satisfy your buthurt at me pointing fingers at immigrants, for once, instead of White people
That’s a weird way of saying that there’s 87% of non-Muslim Italians who aren’t antisemitic
Also, go check the antisemitism index and other studies before you call it a "claim".

I’m kind of fascinated by this story
how can a chain keep boats off a pass
I mean, wouldn’t a big wooden boat launched at full speed break it or pull it out of its anchors
Or am I really underestimating the strength of a chain
Going to copy  paste a post I made :
Hello,
This week I read some articles and listened to a few podcasts concerning the Alstom affair:
This case revolves around the fact that the US government tried to pressure Alstom's management to sell the company to General electrics through bullying and menace of prison time linked to supposed corruption cases in south east asia where the french company was competing with a US company for a contract
The NSA gathered 300'00 emails and 72 Million elements (SMS, emails, phone conversation) on this case alone and tried (successfuly) to break individuals in the decision chain of Alstom in handing them over the company
The company is quite strategic, they are building the turbines for our nuclear submarines and they are also maintaining the turbines in our nuclear plants for instance
As you can imagine such a strategic assets should have never left our control
We are already seeing effects of this buy out :
Alstom, now an american company, lately tried to pressure our national energy company in changing the contract and liabilities on nuclear defects by simply stopping the maintenance of the plants for a few days, a situation that is unheard of
This case is not unique, it happened with a few other big french companies (Technip, Alcatel
) and probably with a few European big ones as well (Siemens for instance)
And I feel this subject is not discussed enough and not known enough
Basically, the United states developed a range of legal tools that permits them to prosecute people who are not living in America and that should not be subject to American law, those tools can be either the use of the Dollar or the corruption law for instance
The funny thing is that this law is very rarely used to prosecute American companies, it is in majority foreign companies that are the target
Now, the sketchy part is the fact that they use jointly the NSA and governmental entities to gather data and spy on foreign companies and governments and then, hand in hand with private american's firms, they pressure those foreign companies in buy out deals
The really horrifying thing is that we don't even know how far this influence goes, for instance, I really wonder why the government didn't try to prevent this sale of a strategic asset, they were probably told to stay away
I am not anti American, in geopolitcs there are no "friends" only interests, but still the USA are so powerfull that this pressure is getting out of hand, it didn't even start under trump, in fact this extraterritoriality thing was most used under Obama
In any case, I thought about it quite a lot this week and as an european I wanted to share with you my thoughts
This economic warefare is a vital topic and needs to be discussed with your local representatives and your governments
In order to stay independent and sovereign measures have to be discussed to counter this
Cheers,
Nice
>Germans are trustworthy towards french people
I think it had to do with our culture
We were originallyy called Francs/Franks, because we were, and still are pretty frank when we talk
I would even use outspoken to describe it
We voice our opinions, especially if it's a complaint (God we LOVE to complain)
I'm guessing that's what makes us trustworthy, being upfront and honest
Anyway love you Germans too
We are pretty close, culturally and naturally admire each other for our positive traits
Hey germany,  we love you too
I love how Great Britain written in german and read by a french just sounds like "Fat Britain"
Indeed, and sane people make a distinction between a government, and the people they represent
As a french I kind of find British monarchy ... pleasantly diverting - but perfidious British people, yerg !
Alsthom doesn't manufacture turbines for our nuclear submarines
The company that built them is Thermodyn, a former subsidiary of Areva
purchassed by General Electric circa 2000
> Colour me surprised
I will colour you black, red and yellow instead
Fits better
I'm a simple human, I see a high quality comment, I read it, upvote it *and* I save it, like any good and enlightened citizen should do
Thank you for (re)posting this
For a Polish, seeing this the day after the Warsaw uprising commemoration, i understand the concern
Elect Trump
Sorry the podcast I listened to are in french, you can probably put the subtitles though :
The interview of the Alstom's director jailed for 18 month in the states (Frédéric Pierucci):
He actually wrote a book about his "adventures" with the american government
The interview of the minister of economy at that time (Arnaud Montebourg):
According to both interviews and sources online, they do,
You have those that called it by the name of the tribe (just like us with the tribe of the Franks) they met there; the Alemanni, the Saksamaa
Those that use the formet Roman given name of Germania
Those that call it "the place of the various tribes / of the people"  Tyskland, Duitsland, Deutschland, ...
Those that call it "the place that is not our people" Niemcy, Německo
So ultimately, place wasn't made of one group of people, and it was different from the other groups, so we called you that
It's funny that France is still called Frankreich where we also are an amalgation of various people
The first Germanic tribe East a of us was the *Allemani*, so we called all German speakers *Allemands* (until the German unification when it came to mean only German citizens) and it stuck in modern geography
The Allemani are the ancestors of the current speakers of [Allemanic dialects] including Alsacians, Swabians and Allemanic Swiss
> Niemcy a Polish colleague once explained to me basically amounts to meaning 'Not us'
The Slavic exonym **nemets** comes fro proto-slavic and means originally "mute" as "people who don't speak the language" and therefore also means "foreigner".
In France there is a thing called "Bercy's lock": the Finance Minister (Bercy) has the power **not** to forward cases of tax fraud to a State prosecutor and instead privately negotiate the fine the fraudster will have to pay in exchange for immunity
It usually is a fraction of what they owe: the government typically favours getting cash in the bank during its current term rather than starting the years-long process of prosecuting the fraudsters and all that money going to their political opponents when they'll inevitably take over
Or the fines are not high enough
Well, lose Alsace Lorraine but gain Sardinia
Not bad

you should have put Breizh on the center of France, and keep the France label for Brittany only

As a breton , I feel insulted that you didn't even bother to place Bretagne wrongly on the map
If you really want to piss off Benelux, you should:
* Merge Wallonia with France
* Merge Flanders and Brussels with the rest of the Netherlands and call it Holland
* Keep Luxembourg within Germany

So they protest against climate change, yet refuse to pay a few more cents per liter of fuel to finance the transition from fossil fuels to renewable resources and disincentivize needless driving
I guess it used to be a forest right here
Poor peloponnesian people annoyed by those flights tho, they should try to make a league or something to defend themselves against the noisy athenians aircrafts
There was an attempt
r/europe doing some Europe propaganda
Some polls showed that UK people are still for the brexit in the majority
Polls either show this or that it's 50-50%. So no
UK people haven't be misled
They decided to quit EU in majority
And they still do
Don't try to prove the opposite by selecting a random citizen that says what you want to let believe to Europeans
Assume what you did Brits
You pergectly knew what you were doing
The consequences have been told again and again
If a new referendum is organized and the remain win, the EU will seem like the less democratic organization
Please be my mom you damn smart beast
Time to reforge the Auld Alliance brothers
It makes no sense to force people to vote
The decision is not any better because you forced uninformed people or people who don't care about the issue to vote, on the contrary
How so
Almost 63 million people voted for Trump, we're far from a small group
There's just the electoral college issue but it's pretty irrelevant to this discussion
If whoever decided not to show up aren't happy with the result, then they should have showed up, their loss
If not, then count them with those who are happy or indifferent with the result
If Hillary had won you could have said the same thing then, a small group of highly motivated voters
It just shows your bias
And seriously can you even read
I addressed the issue of the electoral college, it's completely off topic
If nobody cares about those elections then there's something wrong in the American political culture
Although I admit it seems weird to me to elect sheriffs, judges, attorneys and school boards since they are not political positions
I think responsibility is something learnt, if you force people it's just infantilisation, that's not how the democratic process should be
If people don't care enough then they deserve people abusing their apathy
Why are you commenting on /r/europe
No, because if you have voted you didn't let go of the chance for this situation not to happen
(If we suppose you had a choice that fitted you more, which is clearly the case for Brexit as it's completely binary)
Let me give you an example, just today I realised I wouldn't have some administrative papers when I need them because I did the demand too late
And all I can tell myself is "I deserve this because I didn't do it when I should have". Now, if I did the procedure 4 months before when I should have and the administration still didn't send me the papers in time, then I wouldn't think I deserve it, because I did all I could
Ok I understand your problem now
When I said "we're far from a small group" it was in the context of the discussion, with the meaning "it's not a small group at all". It doesn't seem that much used in English so I probably just made a Gallicism from "on est loin".

Don't wait for Europe that much

how it can be sooo different ?
why would be serbians even thinking about this
why would it matter at all
The EU gives a lot of aid in general
Plus, the Balkans are within Europe so the EU feels morally responsible
Plus there's a healthy dose of self-interest: having poor beggars on your doorstep is asking for problems, especially when you could have loyal allies, employees and customers instead
Let me join the hate train, what is there to hate about Denmark
They just are rival countries
Like Italians and French have a love hate relationship
If anything, the Poles are the ones stuffed with ziemniaki

Yeah, except that May (and frankly the UK in general) are both the victim and executioner
Don't blame others for the shit you put yourself in
He told us he's gonna wait until the end of (Theresa) May
Voilà!
For a lot of them, sadly, the damage is already done, some orchards and vineyards have already lost up to 80% of their expected production in southern France
The issue is that we did have some very nice days at the end March before that brutal late forst episode, so burgeons developped during the nice days, and frost killed them the last few days
I am still upset a so good show died so pathetically
Besançon ?
it is not like he considered UK at all, this is bullshit,
even without the brexit, it also make zero sense to build any major production in UK, when there are more convenient options in EU
I've heard it's difficult to revert brexit because invalidating a referendum would set a precedent that voting is unreliable
To be honest it's a historic that so many regret that vote
We are inside the UE they packed too
Yeah let's stay in this dysfonctionning structure just for a Telsa factory
Except majority of turks support erdogan
Also, the river that runs through Rivendell and that Elrond causes to flood to save Frodo is called the Bruinen, translated into English as Loudwater
So there's a trace of the connection (laut/loud) in the text
Impossible to see that in france ahah
When the PM moves somewhere he has his security convoy, or with a Renault Espace with smoked glass

I hope Paris will be like this one day
Right now there is too much useless car traffic
...in 60 years
Strasbourg is very bike friendly i like it, but I've been to Amsterdam (for, uuuh
reasons) and bike wise they're on a whole other level
They are working on it right now
For example Nation, Bastille and the nearby boulevards have all been redesigned to reduce the space dedicated to cars
I dream of this
I think the political will is there, it just comes down to whether it gets translated into action or not
They absolutely don't
I'm from Paris
I agree that it'd be great but the subway is already often hella packed
Our mayor has been trying to make driving more annoying but without enhancing public transportation
You can't just blame car drivers, everybody has to find a way to move around
We're just not quite there yet where public transportation or biking is easier than driving

I honestly expect UK to be back AS SOON AS Europe federalizes
All is forgiven
Until then, hang on
Pretty sure the British MP won't be in the EU anymore
I know many will oppose it, just like many oppose it in France, but it's the inevitable course of history
No singular sovereign state in Europe can rival superpowers like US, China & India etc
- only coalition
It really should be common sense by now
It is really as simple as bargaining position, be it economical or political
I find it surprising that it needs any explanation
Any state who wishes to negotiate individually with these superpowers hopes to have something to gain over its neighbors or "rivals", but always gets taken advantage of instead
But I like to think critically as well, so to look on the flip side, are there that many conflicts of interest that we shouldn't? It is not as though cultures and languages will perish overnight once we integrate
We share more common goals than not, and frankly the EU is at an awkward stage right now & many grievances UK shared were due to the loose structure of the EU
The EU was always meant to be transitional (with the goal being federalization) & we need to move forward
The union will act more fairly with its structure better defined
but you know they will be, very soon
We're not planning for now but the future (could be very near future) imo Europe couldn't be federalizing soon enough
Something just occurred to me as a metaphor, maybe it'll help illustrating our current state of affairs
Think of the Balkans & how we look at the Balkans
This is what we look like to US & China
We're Balkans to them
We are already fragments because the EU is not enough (clearly) to hold the states together
So it's quite the opposite
Federalization should be fixing the fragmentation problem and unite the nations on many fronts of international importance
And as much as it is an idealistic picture to be satisfied being independent, our core interests are getting more intertwined which is again, truly inevitable

If you're not in the UK (*raises hand*) it took some time in the comments for it to click into place
This is funny but as already mentionned that s an oversimplification
France, Germany, Uk are still individually ahead of India and Brazil in GDP per IMF 2018 figures
By the way, one drawback of EU for German/French/Italian and later British people was/is the social dumping generated by the entry of cheap labour countries along foreign immigration movements continuously occuring
Not fun to see some of "your" jobs going to Romania, PL, CZ and so forth

Well since OP drawed slim papers and 4:20 on the phone, i think he did wanted to represent a joint
4:20 on the phone, slim paper, pretty sure that's a joint
I think there is a big difference in context
Nazi Germany attacked a neutral country, the Netherlands, and arrived in Rotterdam in a few days
The Dutch were negotiating with the German army regarding a surrender, but the German Army had already sent their bombers
They tried to call them off but the German bombers did not receive the order to stop the bombing
The bombing could have been prevented if the German army did not fuck up there
Regarding Dresden, the allies are still fighting in Belgium at that time (February 1945) and Nazi Germany has shown that they will not surrender, no matter what
Dresden was a military target with many factories, which is why it was bombed
The problem with Dresden is that incendiary bombs were used and that people argue that Dresden was not actually a very important military target

They sell the individual bottles that you can refill, the only restriction is that the bottle used for food stuff cannot be used for cleaning products and vice versa, even if you clean it

The Brexiteers are a group of UK politicians who have repeatedly and stridently shot down any proposed way of leaving the European Union but insist that Brexit must happen
Just not like [whatever the proposal is]
The joke is that when prompted to shout out what they want, they're incapable of doing so; they have no vision or ability to articulate a coherent stance
So instead, they just default to shouting that -whatever the hell it is they want- they want it **NOW**. Which is pretty accurate considering they've shot down some deals by virtue of not getting out of the EU fast enough
How come so many UK pictures posted here walk such a fine line between /r/CozyPlaces  and /r/evilbuildings ?
Sadly, they're not real
British MP are living in another world
UK already has the best membership of the EU
They chose à la carte the parts of Europe they wanted and which they didn't wanted
They vetoed for years everything that would lead Europe towards more integration and less being just one big market
They even get a rebate on their participation of the budget
And of course, they can vote on the decisions
Now they chose to shoot themselves on the foot
Let's lose right of vote on how this market works, seems a good idea
But they hope to get a deal that, except from voting rights, would look like an even better membership, without paying
Playing like at home on the market, without having all the constrains other countries have

I have hijacked my kid’s paddling pool
I live in Paris
I only know two people who moved out
One had shitty parents and left at 24, the other just wanted to live on her own is 22
There is also no stigma for living with your parents when your in university
It is somewhat different when you get a job because it can be awkward to date someone who still live with his/her parents but those people still exist
I think we also did comedic movies about 40 years old that won't leave their parents, that is something only medittarraneans will relate with I guess
Tanguy, parti ! Tanguy, parti !
Not it is not, it is on average
A lot of students move out to a big city or Paris like you said
If you take in account those and put it in relief with those who leave at 26-27 you get that 23 on average
The median is probably higher though

So if I understood correctly :
Russia have the biggest population and the biggest area, and France 2nd biggest population and area, so both stayed the same
I thought Germany had more population than France though

FRANCE is FRANCE !
So what's the average demographic density
So France and Russia don't move

The turkish republic is the succesor of the empire
You can bullshit all you want the turkish people lives in the same location, have the same faith/culture, are taught that part of history etc etc
Just because the turkish republic fought against the empire doesn't break the succesor thing

Just because you replaced an emepror with a secular guy doesn't mean turkey gets a pass

I can't get how Eastern France (Alsace) can be less developped than other regions I  travelled or lived in France (Finistere in western France f.e.) or in Europe
What are the indicators ?
It hurts to see the whole region "PACA" of France as developed except for Marseille
If you are an investor, Choose: Southern Italy or Eastern Poland
Yeah, but that's because we have the space to build highways where there is nothing
And there is nothing in a lot of places in France
The northern region actually has the biggest population density after Île-de-France, but if you go directly from Lille to Paris, you avoid the cities
This is not a map of the city founded by the Roman Empire
This is map of the city/fort founded by the legions
Maybe
Clearly not a good map
Well precisely, most of them were forts, not cities
Most places in France have just been turned into gallo-roman cities/villages/towns instead of building new stuff
That's how the Romans rolled most of the time: we get you in the empire and you do your shit on your own
The whole map is probably trash
A lot of these cities were "refounded" by the romans, ancient cities/villages being emptied and peoples settling in the new Roman city
It's the case of Toulouse for example, but it doesn't appear on this map
Rome's Hellenic provinces in the east, except Egypt(which wasn't Hellenic except for Alexandria), were more urbanised than Italy
No, most cities started as villages and then fortified themselves
Most Roman forts were abandonned anyway
...no
Northern Italy was a rural backwater
Central Italy was urbanised
What we call Northern Italy today wasn't even called considered Italy until the last years of the Republic
It was populated by Gallic tribes that weren't fully Romanised until after Augustus

It is Fort Saint Jean
On the other bank there is Fort Saint Nicolas
Fort Saint Jean, until 1944, was having a marble-made tidal scale that has been used to measure French sea-level
From 1883, French elevations are measured against another tidal scale, still in Marseille, a bit Further South
There are so many stories to tell about this fort
Ancient Greek buldings dating 400 BC were also found here, making 2600 years old Marseille the oldest city in France
Where is the famous sardine blocking the port ?
Kalash kalash
Rpz
Smells like piss, full of thugs and corrupt as hell
But, yeah, there are some nice sceneries
I've lived in Marseille for 16 years, and most of it was in the "bad" suburbs in the northern districts
Never seen any of the "bad" stuff people here are pretending to have seen
Sure, as with any big city there are poverty, there are some troubles, but nothing more than what I've seen in other big cities like Glasgow, San Francisco, Berlin or Athens
If you listen to people here, they'll tell you that you'll get mugged every 100 meters, or worse
On peut même voir la sardine qui a bouché le port
You dont want it trust me
True Marseillais still feel a connection with Greece, so guys Marseille is also your place
We even have a Greek church, and the street from the main train station is called rue d'Athènes, Athens street
And of course, the colors of the city are white and blue
Cool

Useless comparison
Different weather/climate, different lifestyle
That's the conclusion I want to agree with .. BUT that's not what this chart is about
If anything, it's about testing policy
Now show me a chart about COVID death amounts and I'll come to this conclusion
The weather is helping european countries atm
Maks have little to do with the low numbers
I was thinking the lockdown would have a big impact on road casualties
Actually yes and no
The number fell drastically, but are a small amount compared to the CV toll
About 300 less road death versus 30 000 covid death here
1%. So even if there a little more or less of other kind of death because of the lockdown it's still by far the right way to count
Probably but the "flu death season", if I can put it like that, had already happened from fall to lockdown
Would be interesting to see a detailed analysis
Well it's a complex issue we don't understand yet why some places were hit harder than others
By the way you should put " département" in quotation marks, for international redditors to get what you mean, because it means in France "county sized administrative area" but otherwise it means, in English, "some part of a company".

I'm to late to the party but here it goes
In France there is this end of school exam
It's the end of high school (US), gymnasium (DE), you see what I mean
It's called the baccalauréat, or bac
100 before the first day of exam it's the "Père 100" tradition where high school student put on the white lab coat (we almost never use) and throw flour and eggs at passerbys, while being chased by the police
Huge fun but I think it's morecand more forbidden and less and less common
When I did it the flour line up in city supermarkets where emp-ti-ed this day ! All disappeared, with some random flour right and left from early battles
Back then it was already forbidden to use eggs and flour, but confettis where tolerated
The deal was to let the steam off in a "violent" outburst, before starting the last 100 days period of working for the exam
Now that I think of it I never hear about it anymore
Maybe it was a south of France tradition

How can you even do an exhibit about Gengis Khan without mentioning the terms "Gengis Khan", "Empire" or "mongol"?

All good so far
it's all over French news, which is a good thing and all, but
Most news sites are posting the original snapchat video, which had a caption "le coran jpete un cable", translated as "On the
Quran I'm freaking out". It's on the Reddit thread yesterday
Most news sites are **removing/censoring the caption**. [Le Monde
Now I'm sure there are good intentions behind this, but this is fucked up
The simple fact that journalists felt they had to censor proves they think the debate on Muslim integration has reached hysteria levels and leaving it in would obfuscate and distract from heroism on display
A few years ago that anecdotal caption would have been fine
Today major news sites feel like they have to remove it, giving plenty of ammunition to the far right for their growing screams of "fake news" and "islamo-leftists".
I don't like where this is going
The fact that people are turning this into something political about immigration (as if this isolated event somehow validates the disastrous immigration policies on one side, and as if it was an organized communication stunt on the other) shows how fucking ridiculous the current political debate has become
Anyway, good on him
I am glad he was made a citizen, definitely a good decision and a overall good message to send
Don't know if it was mentioned but on top of French citizenship he'll join Paris fire brigade, the most prestigious one
> A few years ago that anecdotal caption would have been fine
Seriously ? The caption is just ugly and distracting
Whatever the message most news media would have removed it
Why leave a message that is just a personal statement and very useless, but feel free to recuperate this for your political trolling
Good job
I hope you are right but the newspapers comments sections have been incredibly toxic lately, moreso than usual, so  i can totally picture the editor saying “ok hide this caption it will only make things worse”. When in fact the decision to do so does make things worse by fueling racist conspiracy theories
Agreed, but here they can compare both videos and scream "Look
the media is hiding that we are being invaded
We were right all along

I'm talking about the thread, not your response to my initial comment
Anyway, it's pointless now to keep arguing about it :)
I'm sure France was 140
A lot of highways in germany have parts limited to 120
Also if you have an accident and speed is the problem, and you were over 130, you might have some insurance problems, as far as I know
In France it is 130, but 110 if it rains
So if the UK applied the same reasoning, it would be 110 in the UK
Don't worry, prepare to see 110-100 everywhere very soon :)
A bit understandable given how mountainous the area is, but I agree

I thought it was way bigger than these microstates but you convinced me it's actually not that big and should be considered as a microstate
My bad, I always thought Monaco was as big as Singapore .
If your size is less than 5 times Andorra you're definitely a microstate
Unless the UK somehow utterly breaks down, I honestly don't see a reason to alter the Union Jack, it's an integral part of the history of the UK

They're quite feisty to say the least
>Absolute nonsense and insane that it's being upvoted
Is it really [that surprising] though
Dude there's just a natural tendencies here in mainland Europe to make England the boogeyman of the continent
I think a lot of people quite disike the example that this sets
It's fine for old people to want to leave the EU,but it completely shaft younger people by removing the freedom of movement and the all the  opportunities study wise
I Lived in both france,ireland,scotland and Australia
I went to university in Ireland
Without the EU I would have had to pay ricidiculous prices
Also Australia was hell to get into,so incredibly restrictive
No you are right,I do joke,but that kind of stuff is never quick and easy
As you say,most likely an overwhelming majority would be necessary
Also like for Catalonia part of the reason things are so restrictive is because there is a possibility of a domino effect starting up once the integrity of the state is comprised
But they're still the one with the greatest chance to secede
I'd rather it not be that way personally,I know quite a few Corsicans and they seem quite content for the moment
Look I'm not saying England policies are altruistic as a whole,but which country doesn't act for its own self interest
We should ignore them and let them do their own things, they've always been aloof from the rest of Europe to be honest
No need to have a vendetta against them
Yeah no Corsica is fine but Brittany can't go their food is just too good it would a national catastrophy
Let's indeed not fuckup all this and we'll be A ok

Didn't something similar happen a few (many
) years ago where the EU sent a ton of money to Romania to improve the infrastructure and build highways that would eventually benefit romanians and the EU in the long term, but instead they (the corrupt people that could act on that) bought cheap land here and there, decided highways absolutely needed to run across their property, then used the EU funds to pay the landowners (themselves) insane expropriation fees and now there are small bits of highways isolated in the middle of bumfuck nowhere in Romania

No, not at all, but having dual EU-USA citizenship I can tell you that the majority of urban Americans are on the same page as us, it's the cowboys and hillbillies and Christian Americans in the rural areas that are still three centuries behind
We have more to gain working with America, they are an economic and technological powerhouse with a strong, democratic constitution and it's very useful to have them on our side, we cannot compete with China alone
Why would you think that
Owning a gun isn't synonymous with 'defending yourself', I don't know what kind of gun-lover's logic you have to follow to put that in your mind

He was born in Salzburg if I recall correctly
German as a culture was a thing though
Austria definitely existed and didn't include Salzburg
The archduchy of Austria had existed for almost 300 years when Mozart was born
Saying Austria didn't exist at the time would be like saying France didn't exist at the time even though there was a big chunk of land known as the kingdom of France
So Mozart was Austrian in the same way that the Dalaï Lama is Chinese

[Colbert] statue was vandalized in Paris, and some push to rename one of the Assemblée Nationale workrooms and one of the buildings of our Ministry of the Economy and Finance as they're named after him
It sounds like you can now only be remembered for one thing you did in the context of your time which is now deemed as immoral
So, an old example of Goodhart's law
There is close to a century between these two
One is an accepted king that ruled and died as a ruler
Hitler was different, he doesn't have statues because he died losing a world war and was a tyrant
It's not only about the horror, its also about the ruling time
I don't think everyone know who Leopold II is and what he did
Art is also a way to remember what horror your country did

I study in Lyon, I'd like to see it
I was about to ask the same question, I moved to Lyon this year for studies, and I only saw "Le Mur des Lyonnais", another painted wall by the same artists
This one is the next on my list !
The fuck are they thinking
The people too
Those who are painted on the walls are people who had a role in the history of the city
Some of them are:
* [Antoine de Saint-Exupéry] (writer of *The Little Prince*),
* The chef [Paul Bocuse] (who has 3 Michelin stars since 1965),
* [Auguste and Louis Lumière] (invented the cinema)
* [Abbé Pierre] (founder of the Emmaus movement, the biggest solidarity association in France)
* [Marcel Mérieux] (founder of the pharmaceutical empire Biomérieux, Merial & Sanofi)
* [Claude Bernard] (19th century doctor, inventor of experimental medecine and blind experiments, and discoverer of homeostasis)
* [Claude Bourgelat] (created the first veterinary schools in the world)
* [André-Marie Ampère] (scientist, discovered electrodynamics, invented the telegraph and the electromagnet)
* [Joseph-Marie Jacquard] (invented the automatic & programmable loom for the creation of silk fabric with patterns
Those looms used perforated cards that were later used as the first forms of stocking computer programs)
Complete list here:
It's called a [trompe-l'oeil]

nope, Finland was very important and shocking for french and british people, they asked for actions to defend it
Communism and USSR expansion were really seen as a threat
During the phony war, there were lots of conference held by soldiers for instance to explain what was the problem with Finland
Weapons, as in modern planes were sent there
Allies made attempts and plans to organise help for Finland, ranging from attacking USSR in the Caucasus or landing in Finland to help
Troops were picked and ships ready to be sent to Finland in the beginning of 1940
Those original plans and troops were later used for the Norway invasion
Good ol' Afghanistan too

This pushes the question of waste control
Imo, countries creating waste should be responsible for overseeing said waste, if not for treating it
The globalization of waste treatment is a critical failure currently
These actions are clearly illegal, so I doubt regulation would help
Our problem is that waste management is the end of a long chain of intermediaries which dilute the responsibility of each member of that chain regarding the end result
Waste management globalization may be illegal in a different world, but right now, it doesn't work
By responsible, I meant accountable
Untimately, when such things happen, countries that produced the waste should get fined or condemned to restore the site

You are proud of some guy who was just born in this position

Of MY accomplishments, yes
I am not proud of someone else's.  That would be ridiculous
> The man was born and bred into his role
That is the exact reverse of democracy
You could say the same for Kim Jon Un
And that is the issue at hand
I understand that you refuse to see it, but monarchies are incompatible with a full democracy

Cultural proximity lmao Lyon, Genève and Chambéry in 3 different cultural areas, this HOI4 roleplayer needs to read some books if he's trying to tell me I live in an incredibly multicultural area of Europe
From West of France and I formally reject my cultural similarities with the UK
fuck france, romania and ukraine in particular
This is not okay
I understand that no one wants to be called Eastern Europe but you can't just keep pushing the line eastward and eastward
Nice imperial map
Alsace in Germany ? Poland with Germany ? Bordeaux and Toulouse with Paris, not Lyon and Marseilles
Estonia without Finland
In this case, Western Europe will be reorganized as the Great Atlantic Empire for a more secure society, safe from the Roman threat that the First Wineyard Empire represents
They didn’t manage to get it by force, so now they try other ways

The use of a gun is unusual in recent Islamist attacks and apparently the priest had just won a legal case against a guy (a former monk) for harassment
It could very well be a personal matter gone bad
Yet another proof that this is not about drawings and caricatures
It is about the lunacy of enforcing intolerant, conservatist, and foreign values in a secular democracy, through intimidation
The authorities are still not sure whether it was a terrorist attack or not : [ (article in french)
Apparently this priest had serious issues with another monk from the Orthodox community
I just hope this has nothing to do with the recent tensions between Greece and Turkey, because it could get ugly really quickly
lmao to all people on this thread jumping on the anti islam train while according to the latest news it's not a terrorist attack
Yeah I mean you can't have soldiers in every street
> This happened a few hours after again Erdogan said that ''satire targeted on him is against all Islam and west will pay for it''. Also not random that the Greek orthodox church was targeted
Also 3 days after turkish intelligence tried to have the local turks orchestrate an anti-armenian pogrom in several french cities and had them attack the police forces in vienne and several churches
Hard not to see the link
Odds are ankara ordered that attack
> Dear Muslims, please stop killing people

Unity in Diversity
Yeah, I'm honestly disappointed to see how many governments prefer silence over courage, but what matters the most is the support from the citizens of these countries, so thank you
Thanks, you trained us well to fight extremism
(Just joking of course, sorry if you find it offensive)
Thanks, to be honest I'm proud to live in the country that these fanatics target first: it is tough but we have the honor to stand for freedom
It's sad, but it's also an honor to be the most targetted country
It means we're standing for values that fanatics hate deeply
Now, I also think we're lacking EU solidarity at States levels, but at least people are united, just read the other comments if you have any doubt
Thanks a lot, I saw you had some troubles as well so stay strong too
Thanks, we will
Thank you very much
I wrote this at least 30 times in a row but I mean it
Thanks, stay strong too, you have your own hardships as well
*username checkout* thanks, satan
Hopefully one day we'll stand together as a World united against fanatism and barbarism, not as a continent against other countries
As long as it's not the case, stay strong too
Thanks, hopefully our values won't be used to justify far-right extremism: having that "backbone" is a doubled-edge blade
Anyway, as long as our values don't get corrupted, France will stay strong against fanatics
Thanks, too many people seem to think all muslims endorse violence, every occasion to prove them wrong is useful
Thank you, every country has its troubles so stay safe too, hope you weren't near the earthquake
PS: I'm afraid that not everyones thinks that but I don't care if you're Turk, German or Brasilian
We're all humans, all that matters is to be united against violence
Thanks and don't worry: we know how to deal with extremists, we proved it since 1936
Against this kind of ideology, not giving up caricatures and freedom of speech is something which demands too much courage for most states
You know that there was an official ceremony for Samuel Paty, that caricatures were displayed on some public buildings and that no officials nor cartoonist have any intention to give up free speech
You should check the meaning of giving in, because we're not giving in nor giving up our values
Le Pen is still very far away from being elected
She has max 25% in a second round

We have long history of terrorism and immigration
Populists from left and right are not ruling the country
The attacker knew the priest, who was according the latest news disputed in his own community
Imagine the state of terrorism in France if guns were sold like that
Oh what a great idea, I'm sure all the islamist extremists won't benefit from being able to buy guns at the shop around the corner
Diversity is what brought us here
There is unity in identity, meaning that whatever your skin color/religion/political standing, you are French first and foremost
Which is something we haven't been able to ingrain and now we have Turkish people hunting Armenians in the streets of Lyon and beheadings in our very streets
>meaning that whatever your skin color/religion/political standing, you are French first and foremost
I almost agree, but I think that more important that identy is respect and tolerance
What brought us into this situation isn't diversity, it's the unability of some, in this case the islamists, to tolerate it
What you describe in your 2d paragraphe is a result of identitarism
No, I really think that the EU's motto is wise, and more important now than ever: welcome those who want to unite behind goals of peace, research and freedom, despite the diversity
Imo these goals do a better job at bringing us together than a national identity
Most attacks since 2015 were with knives though
But they are much rarer than attacks with knives
I agree with you on some points but unity at the country-level doesn't not inherently come from diversity
I think uniting behind goals of peace, research and freedom can be even more effective if each participating country believes in these ideals while retaining their core identity
Diversity at the EU-level is a good thing, each country has a point of view and way to approach things that can mesh well with the other countries and form a cohesive unit
At the country-level though, tribalism leads to infighting which is why an ideal such as the French republic, its values and our culture is a good centerpiece for French identity (which is not, and should not, be mutually exclusive to respect and tolerance)
Bringing in diversity that does not believe in that ideal and tolerating intolerance brought us here
My point was rushed in the way I phrased it
I don't necessarily blame diversity, only the acceptance of people who value another identity above the French identity
Believing that being a muslim, a christian, a homosexual, a Parisian, etc
is more important to you than being French inevitably leads to hostility between "tribes".
Yep, which is one of the reasons I'm not too fond of the EU
I think we want to same approximatly the same thing in different words
When you say being French, I prefer to say that we share the most important values, in order to avoid the confusion between priorising these values and ethnical identity
>A terrorist would certainly have no way to access a gun unless he stole one,
Completely deluded
> The black market always exists, whether guns are legal or not
Except it would be infinitely easier to get a gun on the right market than right now
Nice sophism
You can't compare countries like that
You could compare a single country before and after it allows guns though, but I'm not willing to let France be the Guinea pig

14 isn't too far from the optimal sleep temperature at 16°C. Gotta heat that back up when you wake up though
Without the atlantic currents, we would have 10 to 20 degrees less (just have to look the winter temperatures on the same lattitude, other side of the Atlantic)
Glad to know Greece still has electricity, I heard that Merkel was about to cut that too
It's what the temperature in your room should ideally be like, it gives the best sleep quality for a human (at least the average human)
Obviously it doesn't mean you shouldn't sleep under a blanket or something

They should do it even though it's illegal for cops to be on strike
I can't wait to be "everyone for himself". If there is no cops, it's open bar
[Hopefully this]
If you conveniently ignore that he announced reforms that will cost 10 billions and refuses to pay 300m in unpaid overtime to policemen, sure
I don't know
Seems like the purge
Yes good description, thank you
The French don't take shit sitting down
Unlike other countries where the working classes have been shamed into compliance via "entitlement" talk, the French own it and fight at every turn
I wish it was that way everywhere
No one wanted him that much
Just look at the election's score
He passed the second round only because he was up against Le Pen which is basically a free win
First round he had less than a quarter of the votes
He was never majoritarily popular, I'm not sure if you think that "the populace" got together and all agreed on him, but that's not how this works, dear neighbor
Princess Leonor looks like your smaller sister who always wants to steal the remote to watch her series about horses
Princess Victoria looks like your successful big sister who always asks you at the family lunch if you are still single
Prince Charles looks a lot like that uncle who talks way too much about Arabs at that lunch
I just found out that Princess Elisabeth is 18
I guess it's time to marry her off to solidify the alliance with the French
Prince Jacques look like he has successfully overthrown the old republic to bring back order and security to the empire
Yeah, but from a pragmatic point of view, it does help
And if, by chance or otherwise, there's no direct descendants of the last king that's even easier
For France for example, there's 3 different persons claiming the throne
It's a very cold way to say what you feel from my point of view, but the Netherlands has been the target of terrorist attacks in the past
This isn't the first one
I'm sorry however that happened to your country, I think it's too much to me after the NZ terror attack
I'm remembering what we came across through 2015 and 2016 and that shouldn't happen again, but it does, again and again
Fuck them
> normal people
Sadly it's not all black and white
People who tend to harm others cover a very wide spectrum and even the people who are considered normal now may change over time
Often times it can't even be anticipated
In the words of Joker "Madness is like gravity, all it needs is a little push
statistically and objectively it isnt safety wise, especially in western nations
Unless that scares you of course
Can someone explain
You can approve or disprove each person in each list
[Meanwhile in France] We like to keep it simple to make sure every idiot can and does vote
If I understand it correcty, that ballot is the same for everyone in the Netherlands, or is this a local ballot for a local circonscription
If it's the former, doesn't seem like you have a lot of choices compared to the total population of the Netherlands
Edit: Well I think I'm confused because I'm used to our own semi-presidential system, but that begins to make sense reading the comments
Thanks a lot, now I understand how this works
but still why don't do like in France:
Each party prints his list, the elector choose minimum 3 list before going to the boot and can only put one in the enveloppe for it to be valide
Is it to save paper
you sure it works
Or is it you can vote a party different then the candidat you vote for
I say that because I counted votes in France a few times
It's boring and tedious but rather quick
If I recall between 500 and 600 vote are counted in a bout an hour with two tables of four people (so 8 people total)
Your way must take for ever and drive people crazy
If you get paired with someone that doesn't see well you should be excused if you ended up murdering him
Same
MPs are elected in single-member districts with a two-round first-past-the-post system
Regional and municipal elections use proportional representation (with a bonus for the party with the most votes, so not really proportional in fact) with closed lists
French comment isn't really annoying
If you want to _really_ piss off french people, ask for ice cubes with your wine
A better way to piss off the Portuguese is to ask them if they speak spanish rather than "brazilian" (more offensively, just engage conversation in spanish)
>american wines are better
I will cut someone
NO, FRENCH WINE ARE BETTER FU***** REDDITOR
Well done, I'm French and I was irritated by more than one thing
Telling that to a french doesn't piss him off, but it will make you lose all your credibility
Edit: "Italian wine" would be more effective
In Belgium you could totally mention that they are French
Or ask for French fries
Or pretty much anything French related will do
"American wines are better"
Oh, sweet summer child
Monster
That and saying "That's a good pâté" while speaking of foie gras
You mean when they had to hire experts from France because they used sterile tanks as barrels and couldn't figure out why it didn't work
Actually it's so ridiculous it's more funny than irritating
Napa wines are okay
Meh
If anything, "omelette du fromage" or "french surrender" are much more triggering to me
Especially when you just meet someone and they go "ahahah oh you're french ? OMELETTE DU FROMAGE HON HON HON"... Fucking hell mate, what ????
FIRE ZE MISSILES
[(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻]
I think we're okay
I mean we're arrogant enough to just mock you for believing that
I think you can annoy more people by saying Burgundy wine is better than Bordeaux in the South West and the opposite in the East
Oh it's funny to see my [top comment] in this
I didn't know that American vines existed
I'm sure that if you say "american vine" in front of any French, it'll just make him laugh at you
> (joke's on you, you messed up your flight and we get your tourist money)
Typical gypsies
^^^Now ^^^did ^^^that ^^^work ^^^?
> How is Sinterklaas racist
If anything that would be Zwarte Piet
I think that's part of what would annoy Dutch people with that comment
It just sounds like someone which really doesn't know anything about the tradition meddling with things which don't affect them
As I understand it, that's what annoys Dutch people the most about the controversy - the amount of people getting involved which don't actually know anything about the tradition and its history
Oh yeah, this one is clearly better
My mother knew a slovak girl, not long after the independance, and everytime when people asked where she come from, and before anyone said anything she pointed out that Slovakia is not Czechoslovakia or Czech republic
*recoils in horror*
Answer them that french wines are californian, because french vines were destroyed and we had to import them back in the 60's.
It can happen in stuff like sangria, or at cocktails, or wine served as a refreshment (although it's better to put wine bottles in a ice container if you want it cold)
Never during a lunch/dinner, or with good wine
Actually that title is being contested between us and Spain since a few years, the idea that France is the biggest wine exporter is false
But in term of €, we're still ahead
In volume only
In value France is still ahead
Meaning one bottle of French wine is worth 10 os Italian's.
> The French one is also wrong
They would find that comment hilarious
I know from experience that you can rustle les jimmies by declaring that English cheese is better
This would rather get you compassion
We all support your struggle to get ~~foreign~~ edible food, that's why no one complained when you started building an empire
And your Portuguese sounds like polish, Brazilian Portuguese is the real deal
Jk jk jk jk
We must have some leftover guillotines somewhere right ?
Bit earlier than that don't you think
Phylloxera was in the 19th century
But the point still stands
> How- You- I thought we were family
We are, we are
Just look at our flags, almost identical
This makes me think, diplomacy should seriously work based on flag colors
This would be so much easier
Even Brazilians don't understand the Portuguese if they talk too fast
They just ignore half the sounds in every word
We French got really left out in the whole mutual intelligibility thing
Damn Germanic people
Grilleto molto ?
Well, it's probably the kind of alternate fact that the DM or the Sun likes to gloat about :p
And if it wasn't for us you'd still be Austrian
I can't understand most of the debates in this thread but I wanted to say I like you Finns friends !
What can one do to be adopted by these motherfucking handsome shy-but-crazy-when-needed-to-be Metalheads ?
And I'm just here, dreaming of being able to speak some words of Finnish to communicate with the people I dream the most of meeting, and giving up extremely quickly when confronted with how difficult it is
I'm French and I learned some Finnish many years ago
Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but it does get better with time, and if you can speak French which is the biggest mess ever, there's no reason why you couldn't learn some Finnish
And it's worth it to see the faces of the Finns when they meet a foreigner who speaks some of their language
Yes it was
I was taught the word back when I was learning Finnish, and since I daydream quite a lot, a Finn said this was a word I had to know
I think it's a beautiful word indeed, hard H, long A, the ei diphthong followed by the double L, it really has a beautiful flow
And as a bonus, it is often available when I sign up on websites like reddit
Hey, we're experts on British history !
You guys are our fucking best friends

Same thing

Well in french it's either named Routes, Rues or Avenues
But "strates" means "levels within something" for us
Probably one of the best, it's awesome, congrats !

Can't you see the islamoleftists terrorists tore all the buildings down
People like it because it's satisfying aesthetically, not because it is satisfying creatively
> We can do much much better things, that also look much nicer
Can we
It's not la défense or the suburbs that attract all these tourists to Paris, but mostly the old neoclassical or haussmannian buildings
We do try, but it doesn't work
Buildings like Jussieu, the Montparnasse tower, Bercy just stay ugly decades after they were built
All of those look like shit
I'm finding it hard to believe Hungary has a better english proficiency than France
Outside of Budapest I hardly found anyone able to hold a basic conversation in english,
Ha ! We are not the worst !
Romane language countries: suck at english
Portugal: Hold my beer
Why no Slovenia ? They're probably on Germany's level
France can into Baltic
France surprisingly not at the bottom of Europe for English ? That a good surprise
Surprise surprise, saxon languages natives score better than latin languages natives
What, *I* don't speak English
Why are *you* not speaking French
Can we have details on this index
(scale, how it's calculated etc)
As a French seeing my country's bad english scores, no surprise was found at all
Wasn't expecting Spain and Italy to score worse than us though
Here is a compilation of French presidents/prime minister speaking English:
Our politics speak English as bad as yours
French here, yes we avoid pronounce it but sometimes to balance we put it at places where it's not supposed to be hahahaha
I *ave* a lot of love for the HHHenglish languidge
Exactement
Juste assez pour tenir une conversation mais pas assez pour leur faire croire qu'ils sont en terrain conquis
Enfin quand même je veux bien avouer qu’on est pas au top mais nos voisins du Sud sont sacrément moyen en comparaison
badder
Well according to wikipedia[Wikipedia] 30 to 45% of English words are of French origin
So from a vocabulary standpoint, yes, there are a lot of bridges between the two languages even though there are a lot of "false friends".
But pronounciation is very very different, sentence structures are different, grammar, the use of prepositions, even the tenses
The closest languages to English would rather be Scots,  Frisian, Dutch, German, or even Norwegian
Chirac spoke good English too
We laughed a lot about him after his stroke in Jerusalem because it wasn’t perfect at all but he was very angry and that explained his mistakes
I think Fillon, Sarkozy prime minister speak good English too (his wife is welsh)
But indeed our politicians have the same weaknesses as we do in English
Oh okay I was wondering
EST EUROPA NUNC UNITA
Along with the nuclear weapons and the fact that Europe after WWII wasn't the dominating force in the world anymore so the implications of a war in europe for the winner is not as valuable as it was a few decades ago
Uh pretty sure it's Toussaint
someone was asking EU to recognize it
don’t recall it
what are EU weapons ? I know about national weapon (FR,DE,UK), never read about EU weapons yet

Good job everyone ! Except you Italy
there's a mistake on the title, it's the European cup 2018 Not World Cup
I was rooting for Brazil but your team was definitely the better one today, congrats !
Well USA did decently in 2014, too bad they didn't qualify in 2018
An American saying that is the biggest hypocrisy I've seen for a while
You call your national champions "world champions" you dumb

As a north african, sorry spain
I do think we sent you a bit more heat than usual
Would you want a refund tho ?
39 degrees in France yesterday
And here I am, in the UK, sitting inside with a woolly cardigan and fluffy socks
It's a different type of heat
I was in the UK during the 2018 heatwave and it was miserable because of the humidity despite it only reaching 33°C. Meanwhile here in Southern France we regularly get 35°C over the summer and it's not that bad because the air is dry, but I guess we're also more used to it
Above 40 is where it starts to be uncomfortable, especially in city centres
25°C is what we get during a normal day of spring/fall
I'd say it's the perfect temperature for me
It's weird how humans acclimate so much to their environment
I'm not Spanish, but I live in one of the hottest city of France (Toulouse, we got 39°C yesterday and normal summer temperature are often around 30°C)
Having AC in your home isn't that common, maybe in one home out of 4
Most stores / restaurants / public buildings have one though, but our grid is prepared and could even take more because we have higher overload in the winter than in summer (a lot of french heating appliances use electrical power)
And if you want to know why most houses don't have AC, it's because we're used to heat (if it's under 25°C, it's totally normal and until 30, 35°C it's not that bad either) and buildings are kinda built to protect us from these heatwaves even if, seeing as we commonly have 0-10°C temperatures in winter, it's hard to build houses that are both resistant to heat AND cold weather
This highest I ever witnessed was something like 42°C, and the lowest was -14°C (a range of 56°C)
Moi au dessus de 25 je meurs
Tu es solide
**YALL GOT ANY MORE PIXELS ?**
It hurts that we'll never see a big ass EU army with the forces of France and the UK
It would have been a grand thing
Completely
Specially democratic representation, legitimacy and transparency
Don't know either, I just guess that it would be big ? If hasn't really been done before so it's hard to say

Oh, yes

Right
Except not really, one Dutch town just had a shit gimmick idea
Bridges are literally the symbol of making contact, diplomacy, unity, communication
« Building bridges » is also an expression, meaning creating relations
OC ? Thank you for protecting our beloved Europe
Glory to Polska
i forgot to say in my previous comment : i go to Polska many times to see friends in Wroclaw Poznan Warszawa Krakow,  please be my guest for a beer anytime you want
Or for wine, if you come to France
only 1 dead while they were several with rifles
Man we're lucky they don't recruit their most brained animals for these things
The least we can note is that they are organized, and have automatic weapons
6 coordinated attacks ?
edit would be nice to capture a couple alive ; tho that would be risky for the police
Europe keep getting poked at
I hope this is some isolated attacks we've had enough for this year
Stay safe Austrians
As a frenchman, I just wanted to show all of my support to Austrian people, we will stand together !
I want to give all my support to the people there
Austria we are with you
Stay strong Vienna
Welcome to Europe in 2020, unfortunately
It looks like Paris attacks with multiple shootings
All support to our austrians brtohers, stay safe
> As a french
Tu trolles r/france au passage ?
Is the guy who was shot 2 times dead ? :/
Always has been since a decade
They were off duty or police officers who work in plain clothes
We have police units in France (BAC, Street Crimes Unit) who work mostly in plain clothes
I disagree
All religions prevent people from using their brains on select issues
Just look at Poland right now
Obviously I'm not asking to ban religion (Robespierre was a pretty bad precedent) but I'll gladly say ALL religions suck
> No you shit terrorists you won't spur our hatred towards anyone but radicals like you
lol
>No you shit terrorists you won't spur our hatred towards anyone but radicals like you
It is because of people like you that Europe has been sinking for years
People are being beheaded or shot, and you continue to speak the language that has been sinking us for years
Pas du tout, je savais même pas que r/france existait
Mea culpa, ce post a fait la une il y a deux jours:
I don't side with le Pen and I don't support kicking all the muslims out but saying that these attacks will not spur hatred towards anyone but radicals is ridiculous
Maybe they are like you in your countries which are relatively spared by this type of terrorism, but in France opinion is beginning to change
At the same time when people get beheaded in the street, terrorists get blown up, people in bars get shot, it changes the opinion a bit, you know
Especially when this terrorism **always** comes from the same religion
Ah désolé, j'etait pas au courrant, du coup je vais vite corriger l'erreur
You're completely crazy, dude
What the hell man, I told you I'm not a Le Pen supporter
I support Macron's stance in this and I have nothing against assimilated muslims
You've been talking to yourself
> Then why the fuck agree with a dude saying I am sinking EU by saying hatred is not the way
I don't even know what dude you are talking about
What does that have to do with my post
Now Taimou can pursue his bromance with Mickie legally

Most of the wild boars have untraceably low amounts of cesium

Only savage ruins a good pizza with pineapple or olives
>Then he went one step further, announcing that he would pass a ban on pineapple as a pizza topping **if he had the power to pass laws on his own
When I taught French in Canada we had to show the students this video series with a talking pineapple and dancing skeletons
It was terrifying
Real pizza is American though
Not all, but lots of things (including pizzas) are called hawain when they contain pizza in France too

My MEP heavily support the article 13
I might aswell just send him my shit to have some reaction from him
There are barely any MEP in France who don't support it :(
Sure they can, but when you have sky rocketing criminality making a petition against the creation of laws and police to enforce them because of the risk of police brutality is just plain stupid
By doing so, you're saying "well since I'm a greedy cunt and don't want to pay for content, I'm fine with pédo/terroriste sites". It's even stupidier to me, when technically it's just a transfert of what GAFA do with out any control to some form of state org who going to control it a bit and on which people will have influence
Bold move, they've got my support
Does that mean that Lithuania recognizes the seat of President of Belarus as vacant
As Lukashenko is pretty good friends with Putin, how do you think this will play out
Edited to continue the question: with regards to Lithuania-Russia relations
when was the last time lithuania decided who is the leader of another country
embarrassing that people spend time on this shit with straight faces
I'd like to see the EU take a much harder line on Russia
Seeing the influence campaign they're carrying out against the US and EU is very disturbing
Recognizing her as government-in-exile wouldn’t really be that legal though
Though I believe that she did win the election, we have no concrete proof that it’s the case
All we now is that the results were rigged, we can’t call for anything more than new, independently regulated elections
It would take a concerted effort by EU members, but it would be possible: start more drilling in Algeria
There's plenty of oil and gas, and the country would be happy to have the business
Increase production in Norway, and buy more from Qatar and elsewhere
You could find a lot of people in France who would not mind torching this part
Roubaix especially comes to mind

The french government does not use procurement in this case because the passports are printed by the State
There is no obligation for a public authority to open a tender if it can produce what it needs by itself
We love you too Scotland
Well free not really , as a french student you still have to pay for healthcare and somme school fees (spent around 400€ for this year) there is also 7k€/year schools , so it’s not really free even if it’s way cheaper
So meanwhile in France students are wrecking everything because extra-eu stduents fees are increasing to 2k€
What a kick in the nads for the English
Could not believe this when I found that my (french) son could study for a year in Scotland for free
That is neoliberalism for you
You can thank David Cameron for that

Interesting ones (according to me):
- Gaston Monnerville, politician and lawyer, he was the president of the Senate from 1958 to 1968
Note that the president of the senate takes temporarily over from a dead president of the republic
So it is not a minor post
- Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, general in the French Revolution and father of Alexandre Dumas (The 3 musketeers)
- Chevalier de Saint-Georges, composer, conductor, and violinist, master fencer and military man
- Severiano de Heredia, president of the municipal council of Paris (1879–1880/ sort of mayor of Paris ), deputy for Paris (1881–1889), minister (1887)
- Eugene Bullard (not on the list because he was not French), flew planes for France during WWI
He escaped segregation in the USA, came to France, learned to fly planes
(Edit: Just found a 9mn movie about him:
For all its fauts, I doubt there is any other european country that can put such a list forward
[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas] such a badass that Nazis felt compelled to destroy his statue
Edit : ok, other people were quicker
France had a black president of the senate between 1947 and 1968 while in your country they couldnt even sit with white people in public transports
Dont even try to lecture us
Also sources about the slaves till the
1920s, sounds like bullshit to me
And "enslaved nations" is ridiculous
Especially coming from an american
Colonisation was a bad thing for plenty of reasons, including for the french people themselves, but it's not slavery
To be precise Haiti's deb was acquitted in 1830
1947 is when Haiti ended all payment on the loans they had contracted at that time
And while it certainly doesn't look good for France this debt is certainly not enough to explain Haiti's difficulties
>millions
Source ? As I said, pure bullshit
300 000 civilians
Which is to much, but not 1 million
Also

I wasnt even born
And I have no ancestors that fought in those wars
That's how history works : while people in France were taught the good side of things related to Napoleon, the rest of Europe portrayed him as a blood thirsty monster
I am no historian, but the context of Napoleon (the Revolution) "explains" his actions
To make things simple, right after the Revolution, there were three periods of turmoil, to put it kindly
The Terror (one of the worst dictatorship Europe has knew), the directorate in 1795, and then the Empire in 1799 (that's when Napoleon came to power)
Right after the fall of the 'Ancien regime", France was in a dire state of "War within and war outside" as it was facing the French people loyal to the monarchy inside, and the coalition of European monarchies that didn't want the idea(l) of the révolution to propagate to their own countries and put in question their "divine right". By the end of the Directorate, when napoleon seized power, France was at war with Britain, Austria, Prussia, the Kingdom of Naples, Russia, the Ottoman Empire and others
So one good thing, from a French perspective, is to have France survive against those odds thanks to him
The other good things is that he gave the means for clever French minds to modernize the country (he helped modernize justice and administrative systems in French, education system, sanitation in Paris, odd and even numbering of houses in the streets, pavements, production of sugar from beet roots, margarine, tin cans ...)
Then, while I don't understand or know why he needed to try to conquer Europe (I suppose there is retaliation and dissuasion involved at some level), I see it as problematic as the Roman empire doing the same
TLDR : after the revolution, situation in France was very chaotic
Napoleon brought A LOT of order
(Edit :) How he's portrayed nowadays is heavily tainted by past nationalistic propaganda
> Biggest personal disappointment is that for some reason post-Napoleonic Netherlands decided they needed to be a monarchy
I guess that was part of the prize for foreign support for our independence
(a bit of contradiction eh
Foreign support needed to be independent)
Weren't you also the first modern Republic ? "Modern" as in not Roman
Also, you didn't have a "Dos de Mayo" so I can understand why he doesn't have such a bad rap in your area
> Our 'liberalization' (vassalizing) by the French republic cleaned out that mess
I can believe that
Napoleon, a few Roman Emperors and Mustapha Kemal have probably been the most efficient leaders in History regarding improvements brought to  archaic regimes
Carolus Magnus maybe also
Thanks for the link btw, it was quite an interesting read
Funny how your constitution inspired the American one (for the federal part), yet they seemed to see your country as an example to not follow because of the imbalance of powers

I give after-school lessons to kids in a North African family, they're Muslims, but both parents told me that France was gonna be unliveable in a couple years/decades and things were going to shit so fast over the last year

It's funny I had a spanish colleague when I was working in Paris who used to say Joder all the time and I started saying it as well
Actually I'm slightly tilted because it's clearly written "Putain

Because it's derogatory
But the prostitute meaning is dated, it's pretty much only used in literature now
And like whore in English, the meaning is actually closer to "sexually immoral/filthy"
Anyway, now it can apply to *anything* ("where the whore is my phone charger
Interesting - "ébats"  is a polite  french word translated as "frolicking" by one dictionary, although often the frolicking is in bed
I see this as a win-win situation for NL and FR ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Really ? Dublin is the only airport in Europe which made me throw away 10cl bottle of ultra expensive hair solution because it would fit my plastic bag (from Athens Airport, you heard that right

That was extremely retarded as those regulations are set at EU scale
Total inflexibility, a bunch of money thrown into the trash, really upsetting situation
This was so ridiculous it still makes me mad today when I write it

Managing this crazy roundabout is the ultimate test for a french company autonomous vehicle
True story
Link in french
That's because it is not a rotary (giratoire)
It is a real roundabout, or square (place, rond-point)
Different rules apply
Paris is one of the only city in France with no "giratoire". But it is very confusing for people not parisian
The rule for "place" is simple : respect red lights if any (to enter it, or within it, like there are red lights at Bastille), and where there are no red lights, give right of way to people arriving from your right side
So that's the same rule than for any other street
But that means the priority is reversed compared to the rotaries
In a rotary, people already in it have priority, and people wanting to enter have to wait
In a square / real "roundabout", people entering it have the priority
So if sudenly, you are within place de l'Étoile and an avenue at your right has a green light, you have to stop to let people enter
Simple way of behaving on place de l'Étoile: enter it boldy, rushing to the center, knowing you have the priority
If a fucking tourist from you left side already on the square doesn't let you the right of way, honk him and make obscene gestures with you hand
Then once on it, start looking for cars entering from your right, and kindly leave them enter if any
If nobody, you can exit the avenue you wish (don't forget your turn signal)
And yes, there are accidents, but as everybody is freaked out, people are driving slow, so it is barely deadly
(I was a bike messenger for years in Paris, and this square was finally quite easy to ride, a lot of space and people driving slowly
_note : editing linked to /u/LaFlammekueche comment, I inverted "roundabout" and "rotary"_
That goes for most plazas and roundabouts in Paris
It takes forever to go through them
It was designed in an era when cars didn't exist
It's an abomination as far as roundabouts are concerned (like, 4-5 lanes wide ?), but you get used to it
hahaha yes
The people of Paris has always been fiercy and prone to revolution
That's why Louis XIV moved the royal palace to Versailles
The Revolution of 1789 is known as the French Revolution, but we also had major revolutionary episodes in 1830, 1848 and 1871 (some also mention may 1968)
Unfortunately the gentrification put an end to that
When I'll become president of France, I shall change that name into "Place de l'Etoile de la mort" (Death star plaza)
Vote for me !
It's like most big cities nowadays : just don't drive in them
I avoid driving in Paris intra-muros as much as I can, it's just a nightmare
I'd rather take the subway or walk

What's the definition of Pornstar did you use
> women should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, and I agree of course,
>but there is not one good thing about living in a country with disproportionately enormous number of sluts willing to fuck for money
"I'm open minded, but in fact no".
You judge women for using part of their body (vagina) to work for the enjoyment of your little Jhonson
But you have no problem when they use:
* Their vocal cords for the enjoyment of your hears
* their hands to cook for the enjoyment of your tongue
So what's the conclusion
The problem isn't the women's body
It's you and your little jimmy

I'm French, and my opinion is that there's a lot of difference between what people will say (or feel) they'd be ok with those things, and the reactions they'd actually have when faced with those issues
Especially the questions about dating blacks/muslims
Saw this in the mornin & had no idea it would blow up
Still a pretty bad & inaccurate map imho
Asian Muslims aren't so common in Europe
Probably you should read Muslims as Arabs
I have only met one Arab guy that wasn't also Muslim (I live in France), and I've met a lot of Arab people
Islam is very strongly tied to Arab culture, and 99% of the time you wouldn't be wrong calling an Arab guy Muslim instead
Just like most people from Isreal (or with Isreali origins) are called Jews even if they don't practice or follow any Religion
I'm a guy, but I've seen that in France people who claim to be super open minded about that are suddenly less so when their teenage daughter starts dating a black or arab guy
Maybe they have a significant minority I know nothing about

People don't have all information in need to know what is really euro and how euro destructed their purshasing power every where except in germany where ECB is localised so they control it
Euro is just Reichmark with a new name
Common currency without common economic policy can be a mess
And can sometimes means the common currency is handled in a way adapted to the average economical situation of the Union but detrimental to your specific country
I've also seen some economist arguing that some clever combination of a global currency and few local ones for specific purposes could be better for the economy, but it start being outside of my level of understanding
(In some way, this already exists in some countries with "meal tickets" that can be used only to buy food)
Currency is a question of sovereignty; as soon as you will drop your national currency, you will loose the power to freely create/destroy money and fix your currency trade
Having a single currency for so many different national economies is a disaster that southern economies are currently suffering
France is not doing well because the euro is too strong compared to USD
Would it be 20% weaker, our economy would be way more competitive
Personally I see none, but I am not aware of all monetary concerns and geopolitical fallouts
The Banque de France cannot have its own monetary policy and I believe it is a big issue for french democracy
Afterall, finance is shaping the future by directing flow of money in one direction or another
Yes I could see that and it would be a good thing in my opinion
Not soon though because the French public is still pro-EU; despite Frexit being a growing thing
However, I believe Germany is more likely to slowly break apart from Euro as it is holding most of the TARGET2 debts
So if southern countries leave the Euro or are unsolvable, Germany would be left with a very salty bill of debts that are not going to be paid back
Hence its in German interest to leave the monetary union first

OP included regions randomly, not everyone is there but rather when there is a will for independance, apparently
Corsica had nasty independentists, lots of bombings for decades, usually aiming at the buildings rather than people
But actually the majority is against independence
It as stopped for a while now
I think after they assassinated a Prefect it cooled down
Conventional wisdom is the independant mouvement was closer to organised crime than freedom fighters

Ukraine was part of USSR so, obviously ?
> I wonder if germany had any chance at all of winning the war in the east, maybe it was doomed from the start
The "what if Germany had done stuff differently" replays some people enjoy to do are usually split around two things: what predictable mistakes Germany could have avoided with the informations they had (i.e. "they should probably have avoided opening another front"), and what moves Germany could have made without having reliable information about it (i.e. "if they had attacked this place it was game over")
I believe the consensus about the first category is that it would not have changed the course of the war
When it comes to the second category, the issue is that people fail to realize that this kind of things is down to luck, and when you sum up all the things that could have gone better and the things that could have gone worse, Germany already got *very* lucky
To me, this kind of debate usually boils down to people claiming that, having won second prize at the tombola, it wouldn't have taken much more to get first prize, and therefore, not getting first prize was unlucky

Thank god globalism isn't dead
Another short sighted trade deal that doesn't take into account carbon emissions and doesn't leave space for a carbon tax
The EU is still as oblivious as ever to the main issue of this century
Edit : to those downvoting me, please explain how any trade can be fair when the pollution costs of the goods's country energy mix as well as the pollution cost of transportation are not taken into account ? Or how any trade deal that offloads the cost of carbon pollution on our children and grand children so that we can consume cheaper goods is responsible ?
Yes, this trade deal didn't create the issue of global warming
But it is just another irresponsible move that shows that for the EU, trade is much more important than the climate, outside of some greenwashing here and there
French here, we already are the biggest weebs
We already have that in France
Isn't that in your nature though
I mean im no expert, but it seems a fairly logical statement to say the US has been a keystone in the current international world order
> Let's implement it for Eu products first
Look at the amount of awareness about a carbon tax in this thread and see how many downvotes i get when i remind people of the very inconvenient truth that we are not paying for the pollution of our consumption products, as we should
Do you see a carbon tax happening ?
Let us stop pretending it is not clear cut
Carbon pollution is directly linked to consomption for the overwhelming majority of our goods
Consomption increases when goods are cheap
Trade lowers the cost of goods when pollution is not taken into account
Any counter example you may find about these facts (and you will be hard pressed to find any) is the exception to the rule
Look at the reactions on this thread, all the guys hoping for cheaper electronics or other Japanese products
Do you think people have realized that they get their goods as cheap because of the fossile fuels and that they are increasing the carbon debt to the future generations ? Do you think they *want* a carbon tax that would reduce their purchasing power ?
Yeah, sure
Tells that to the economist or the wall street journal that have endorsed a carbon tax
The Paris accords are more of a framework than a binding agreement
The idea of the accords was to build upon the international cooperation started on this day
But since then, there has been very little momentum going
That's true, but they aren't alone
We in the EU have our fair share of detractors
Wall street journal and the economist, leftist journals

If you're wondering why it's abandoned :
It's on private property, meaning that the municipality doesn't have to take care of it, like most churches in France
The owner, for a reason or another, couldn't or wouldn't maintain it
It's also very recent by France's standards, since it's a neo-gothic chapel from the late 19th century
Although it looks nice and ornate it doesn't hold much historical or cultural significance compared to the hundreds of actual gothic churches from the Middle Ages all around France
C'est ou ?

It is on a private property and it seems line it is a recent building (19th century)
It has no historical value and it is better to put money in building that are 500 years old even if thet are less beautiful
Truth be told there is thousands of churches like this in the country
That's why some are not protected
We can afford to lose a few of these

So don't worry, they're still relevant and read by kids today
At [the end] of "The Twelve Tasks of Asterix" cartoon movie, Caesar retires in a peaceful life with sexy Cleopatra, so it's almost a win

100+60+10 :)
I think it's [this one
] No serious injury though

yeah, we have a lot less than 1/4 to 1/10 of the school shootings than the US
I think the media attention the shooters get is a big part of the problem

Yep, je fais souvent du vélo dans l'Oise/Val d'Oise
Oui c'est très sympa, y'a quelques petits villages très sympas paumés dans la forêt, qui vaut le détour en elle-même d'ailleurs
Mes grands parent sont de pierrefonds et j'y passais pa smal de vacances en visitant notamment le chateau
Si tu veux voir le chateau de pierrefonds une demi journée pour s'y rnedre et visiter suffit
Tu peux aussi te balader dan sle bois qu'est vraiment très sympa
Je t'invite a aller voir le chateau imperial de compiegne avec ses collections
Ca vaut vraiment le détour
J'ai la famille vers Beauvais, mais j'ai toujours  voulu visiter Compiègne et sa région
Du coup ce chateau va en être l'occasion
Sauf que je suis plutôt loin
Et même si je me rapproche en venant à Beauvais, il y a une connexion avec Compiègne ( bus / train ? )
La fameuse ligne 33E qui t'emmène de Beauvais à Compiègne pour 3€
US Congress and Palace of Westminster are definitely fake historicity
When they were built, yes definitely, but not anymore
Westminster will become true historicity in few centuries if still there
If you're surprised that being historical is kind of relative to how ancient it is, just open a dictionary
A Disney castle built yesterday is definitely not historical
If still largely unchanged in more than 3-4 centuries, it will become historical
got drunk with some homemade țuică 20 years ago in a small village east of Satu Mare
Tasted pretty good but it burned like hell
Good thing is, I stopped feeling my throat after the 3rd glass

Good luck Germany from France ! We need your sound leadership in those troubled times
Let's not talk about the coal and oil plants they re-opened because they abruptly closed all nuclear plants
Do you have a link when you can see when each country will have its turn please ?
Yes, I can safely say that our neighbors from the east are our best allies
Wir lieben sie !
A scientific paper released in 2019 found that the German nuclear shutdown led to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions around 36
2 megatons per year, and killed 1100 people a year through increased air pollution
As they shut down nuclear power, Germany made heavy investments in renewable energy, but those same investments could have "cut much deeper into fossil fuel energy" if the nuclear generation had still been online

Thank you !
You can take any North/West European country, and compared to the 200 or so countries in the rest of the world, things are quite good - not only in an economic sense, but in social rights, education and whatnot
In my experience, only uneducated people have curious preconceptions about Germany
However, it is true that outside Alsace, people don't dig much about Germany or study the language
Our second language in school is usually Spanish
In the PACA region it can also be italian
German is mostly studied near the border
Yes
there are no coal plants opening in Germany
There are also no war in Ba-Sing-Se
Way to nitpick
An European western country even still having coal mines today is a disgrace
Closing nuclear plants before coal plants is just conceding to fear instead of thinking rationally
basically all the state newspaper and cable websites from the US will have similar blocks in place

It just takes a jab at America

I still don't understand how they managed to enter in the first place
This so sad, as it's finally clicked that it is really happening
Proud of you guys
Not the dailymail but UK in general
Show us the way
British phlegm I guess
That's what makes it sad
Almost everyone in the EU was an Empire at some point
Some even had severals
Erikson failed while Colombus suceeded
What else is there to discuss
Amazing pic cut I can still feel the motion sickness through my screen ngl
I take offense at the size of France
It doesn't even include my homeland Brittany
And given the (often awful) role my country has played for centuries in Europe, it feels like it's downplaying its historical legacy
/s I'm not really offended though, just a bit disappointed
Wait you used Germany when France is literally the shape of a torso/t-shirt
And France is the one that's been at war with everyone else and also been allied to all their former enemies at one point or another
Without my forefathers, Europe would have turned out very differently
OMG, I mean I know, obviously, that different countries/cities are named differently in different languages, but Lontoo cracked me up
In france we have a region called Auvergne, shaped like a dick with 2 ballz
might be a little too small for Europe Man, he would have to compensate buy having a Big SUV
Yeah, if some shit happened in Europe during the past millennium, you can bet your ass that France was involved one way or the other
Either directly, or backing, openly or secretly the side that suited them the best
They were not always major actors, but almost always were pulling some strings one way or another
Usually to piss off the English or another of their usual partners in war
But then, you have to look at the geographic situation of France: with access to the Mediterranee, the Atlantic and the English channel, borders with the Iberian peninsula, Italy, Switzerland (despite their current neutral state, they used to provide very skilled mercenaries to the highest bidder - already had their lust for money I guess), Germany (formerly the HRE which was also a great power in Europe they had to deal with as well)
All that plus of course our personal nemesis: those pesky people across the channel who've tried holding lands in France since William the Conqueror crossed the channel
And that's not even counting the viking invasions that lasted for a while when France and the British isles became their playground
But then, France occupies a pretty strategic place in Europe and with its leaders not always great people (our last king got shortened by a head by his own people after all) it's no surprise that we've been brewing shit all over the continent, either to defend our precious territories or trying to steal some land or riches from a weaker neighbors
That's just how people rolled back then

Corsica's flag got forgotten in the process lol
Great art tho

I mean Den

Of course happy Fat Thursday !
I have so much things to say about the design of this donut
The funny fact is that Audi just oppened a new factory in Mexico, not the best choice
Let's not blow thing out of proportion, he didn't declare war on us
at least for now hehe
Also I consider Trump presidency as a good way to take our independance from our american overlords, as a french I see that as De Gaulle wet dream becoming real
If he doesn't invade another country like Bush and Obama did I would consider him a good US president already
He's destroying nothing, it's only the medias who are talking about it like if it was something big, but it isn't. It's not only about one person, it's about an entire country, you shouldn't listen too much Trump or what the medias are telling you about him and what he supposedly told
And about bad relations, look how we (french) went from 2003 when we refused to take part of the Irak war and were almost seen as US enemies to where we are right now, with still strong friendship between our two countries (and this "bad story" is completly forgotten
Has Spotify been sold ? I thought they were still independent

For now there's still no better solution for low/middle-range travels like on the NYC/Boston/Washinton DC area, even more in this context of climate changes and our targets of lowering the global CO2 emissions

what climate change is doing in this list lol
>Crazy 2 round system
It's just FPTP

It's not much but i'm thanking fellow europeans wanting to support us in this weird (and depressing) time
unexpected but very very welcomed
Even if it's the opposition and most likely to never see day, thank you, gesture sincerly appreciated
For a sec I read that Denmark calls for sanctions of France and supports Turkey
Damn I'm tired
Thanks Danemark from France
Tbh i don't feel supported enough by Europe in this fight
We had enough of this
Thanks Venstre
Also, it is time to halt Turkey's EU accession process
Each things in it's time
First we're taking care of Muslim Brotherhood, once that's done, we'll see how SA has evolve, since they mostly act in reaction to that first movement
> But boycotts are a form of protest
You cannot sanction peaceful means of protest that harm absolutely nobody's well-being
Boycotts fall under freedom of speech
That is true for private citizens
The thing is Erdoğan is a head of state, when he calls for a boycott he crosses a fine line and then it becomes a trade war, a completely different beast
You'll note that other head of states of Muslim countries remained very quiet about the boycott for this exact reason
Freedom of speech then if the EU boycotts Turkish products
Isn't this just the follow up ? If I recall all started for Charlie Hebdo because they republish the cartoons while muslim was defying to do so
So I'm totaly aware of the origine of all this
If it's the unexpect part that threw you off, it was not in regards of that
It's more that internationaly you guys are usualy the quite and supportive type
So you guys showing will to be proactive on that issue way before the usual supects surprised me
A law is about to pass about the end of external financement of mosque
You hear number like 50% of Imam in France are Turc, therefor Islam Brotherhood
Kind of easy to understand that if you can pay the guys anymore not sure they'll keep preaching Islam Brotherhood bullshit
Je ne doute pas que ce que tu dises soit vrai, mais les Frères Musulmans sont Egyptiens, pas Turcs à la base

Oh the irony
My team plays next week
Here's a poor man's gold for you
Why ?
I couldn't understand why France was this way, for example a big part of Aquitaine ( = south west) is rural, with certainly low levels of tertiary education, but it's blue
But I think I have the explanation, the number climbs up to the next level (tertiary) when there are more universities available, thus big cities
So the Paris area = check, same for Nantes+Rennes area, Bordeaux,Toulouse, Marseille, Lyon (going counter clockwise if you are not familiar with France's geography)
Wow i thought at least 90% of people in my country went to college, seems like i was wrong
Yay, go Rhone Alpes
Immigrants in France are from Maghreb and Subsaharian Africa, not Pakistan nor Bangladesh
I live on a 4
54 billion years old planet so why not
Beautiful
Any kind of violence is suicide at this point yeah
Man, you guys are family, we stick to each other
With regards to the proportion of the population
Probably
But France, by dint of having a much larger population, even with a much lower proportion of english speakers, still has em beat in absolute numbers
Also, your common love affair with beer
I can't believe some people still want this country to integrate the EU
Days like today make me grateful that Turkie will **NEVER**, ever be part of the EU
Tiny UK lol
Never thought I’d see that place here
Been there a few times
It’s absolutely gorgeous
Thank you, praise the lord I'm grateful for your existence
The heatmap was in absolute value, not percentage point
Eg in a country A where the average salary is 100 the loss is 50, in a country B where the average salary is 500 the loss is 100
The loss will clearly be worse in country A yet the way the map was made country B is presented as worse off
Your salaries and general cost of life is higher so it meant very little to see Norway in purple in that heatmap
Happy National Day Romania
I've had a brief email correspondence with a French UE representative on the matter, and she had no idea what was happening, she thought I was a GAFA supporter
Those people have no idea that what they're doing is Brexit-level idiotic because they don't understand anything technical, and don't even realize their ignorance
How can we reach them and teach them
WTF I'm mad now
Okay, but shortbread though
He's got a point
Oh no EU is not relaxed, just fed up with UK childishness
Just go, go see the world with out EU, and only come back when you finish puberty crisis
No we don't.

The EU has over twice the population of the US, it adds up

This is so true
I don't think I have met a single Trump supporting American who is visiting Europe as tourists
To a Trump supporter the world ends at the state line and the universe ends at the national border
I'm from a touristic area of France, the beachy kind, I never noticed Germans and holes
This thread seem to think that it is a thing
Is it
How is that related to what that guy was saying
Or did you HAVE to counter any criticism of old mother Russia
"oh no
Someone on the Internet criticised Russia
I cannot let this happen
Well, so did I, I dug holes, made castles, race tracks, etc
I never noticed holes being particularly German, I mean
The "both sides" false equivalency bullshit is wrong
Non-Russian Europe is way more respectful of its citizen
It is not an utopia, nothing is, and we have plenty to complain about, but we are nowhere near their version of state control
It is valid is be displeased with our shit parts
But comparing it to theirs
Fuck no
Fuck their politics and how it affects us
The above applies to other - negative- outside influences by the way, not just Russian
But another user pointed out that you seem to be a very big Russia supporter, therefore I do t reckon we have much to discuss
I pity anyone who fell for their propaganda
They aren't there to defend your freedom to disagree with the mainstream, they are there to divide us
Fun fact : Netherlands is called "Pays-Bas" in French, which roughly translates to "low (height) country".

Do non-French people know it ???
Along with Georgia and Armenia, unless they are even emptier than I remember
That was a cool trip !
I wonder in how many (if any) countries are not on top of their own popularity list
>"Not heard of" : 1%
Cunt !
How do 1% of British people haven't heard of France
3% never heard of Ireland and 1% of France , how stupid can you be ?
I'm actually impressed that only 15% of English guys have a negative opinion about France
Why do we care about what the rosbeefs think though ?
They're not even in the union anymore lmao
That's sad somehow because on many streets interviews in Russia you can see they have a positive opinion of UK
But as always western countries persist to see them as eternal foes
I don't think English people are aware that international football was played in 2008

With time between election being around 5 years, I am always very doubtful of any ambitious plan that go further than that
People saying that they will not replace the power plant that will close in 2029
They have the times to change their mind 25 times
The issue with most renewable is that you barely have any control on the power production (and could overload the grid by accident)
All the other, you can regulate the output, and nuclear is the second best tech for that (after hydroelectric under normal circumstances)
Plus until we can store massive energy, you're bound to have fun if there is no sun or wind
That makes the opening of a new one a very strange endeavour
Anyway that's a good news
It's weird to think I live inside that tiny little nook, like some silverfish inside the a crack in the wall
how/where do you get these pictures ?
I hoped there would be a website where you could select a place and it would render it for you
So basically Finland
For a good one, yes perhaps
For a too efficient one, I'm sure it will be easy
It suffices to see how content is already automatically flagged on YouTube when it contains bits of right holders
Except that with the law as it is now, you won't be able to see that flagged content anymore, even if it the use of content is legal within the country (like the right to parody)
So, if I'm doing a snippet for my friends, like I'm talking to them about what I read, I should have a license ? After all, I'm using copyrighted content
This is my point
For the moment, it's only on webpages, but what's next ? I'm just showing how this is fallacious
News outlets are trying to make money on free advertising, and I'm not sure they will like it when it backfires
Although Assange was arrested while the UK was still a EU member and part of his trial took place while they still were in the EU, the UK hasn't been in the EU since January the 31st of 2020
The judgement about his extradition was rendered last week, so had nothing to do about EU policies regarding extradition
Oh please tell me there is one, I didn't know I wanted this until now

The sign "Brexit" is in fact B.R.E.X.I.T, short version of Beer, Revolver and Ecological Exit, the main party of the Third French King-cracy
Of course, we don't see France because in 2017, both United Democracies of Europe and France were separated by the Calais Portal, a blue shield created by the Society of Nations for prevent Elizabeth III to make sand castles at Utah Beach
Why the political cartoons were so easy back in time ?
If historians lack the context to understand the picture they are probably not very good historians, are they ?

Being an expat, one always gets the same comments over and over
You wanna stop doing something : boom, you're a surrendering monkey
You disagree on something "why don't you go on a strike for it
I mean just try saying you're French on reddit and count how many people will reply "baguette" or "fromage".
In France people who don't care about international politics will still discuss Brexit as in "Haha England is getting fucked, they had it coming"
Not surprising ; many countries probably forgot they're part of the commonwealth
Hey, for once they didn't get the flag upside down
You can take it back tbf
33°C south of Paris today, I was literally melting in my house
Imagine moving from southern France to Scandinavia and thinking "wow, I'm really looking forward to those mild summers !"
Fucking pranked lol, it's the same temperature here, except its unbearable because the arcane technology of AC has not yet reached this remote frontier
No AC and no insulation here
I can't sleep, my head hurts like hell
Some years it gets so bad that it's dangerous to stay in my bedroom (under the roof), I've almost passed out before
I hate it
Fuck climate change and all the rich assholes that let it get worse and worse every year
Take this, Austria
How is it that the temperature in Paris was the same as in Madrid
Climate is wacked
I like that picture of skeletons in inferno
Just buy a fan
This:
It's even worse when you look at the minimum temperatures  last night at 24
3°, Paris was warmer than places in Andalusia, Sicily, Tunisia or Egypt
Personally a good fan does the the work for me, it doesn't cool down the temperature but you get a feeling of freshness
Also closing the windows and shutters during the day is very important to keep the temperature down, not all people do that
Then at night we can open the windows :)
If some people need a good standing fan, I recommend to buy the Klarstein Silent Storm
Very good and silent at the same time, so great for sleeping
You could become a scientist and go spend your arctic summer doing research in the antarctic
Lmao the French are lying
I think it was more like a caged lion
So do you prefer to be a caged lion or a free cat ?
"Oh god oh fuck what have I done
If by caged you mean part of a democratic assembly of nations and by free you mean subject to the influence, politics and diplomatic power of much bigger powers
In the same way your country is bound to its deals and international treaties it signed

We'll be with my teenager, she's not yet in her "lazy and bored mode" so I feel we'll be able to move around

First economic power, maybe  yes, but military, no, there is not even an "European army".
Completely absurd
EU doesn't not even have its own army (gladly)
What you say it's not even "potentially" probable
Yes it's absurd
Number is less and less relevant in military power nowadays
Most of the EU countries don't have recent big operations experience, so it will make a bunch of inexperienced troops together
Germany, the power of the EU, has an army in decay
Other countries are not that big military power outside of the three biggest EU countries
So yes, even merged it won't be the biggest military power
Any country can make this law EU has nothing special here
The EU can't do shit
There are days were we get called 4-5 times by scammers
Sometimes, it's just a ping call
Sometimes, my "medical shit" has problems in it
Sometimes, it's a weird, 12-figures numbers ping calling
Sometimes, it's to sell house insulation
The land line is becoming literaly unusable because of scammers
I bet it'll be the same for mobile numbers soon, wait until they get some more exposure
I'm really sorry but i'm fucking done with this shit; i'm buying 3 AC units for my reinforced concrete appartment
I haven't slept properly in 4 nights, i'm completely fucked up right now

Duckduckgo is better than Google (edit : **privacy** wise, not search wise) but it still doesn't has its own search engine (yes, it has a crawler but it hasn't been updated in two years according to /r/duckduckgo)
Also, it is US based
I dont think it is better than startpage which is Google through a VPN
While it is far from being perfect, qwant is the only european engine that has its own crawler and search engine (still in development so the current version is a mix of bing and qwant engine, progressively phasing out bing)
I think that if you want to support european independance from the gafam, qwant is the best engine right now
it won't find everything but for 90~95% of your searches, it will be good
What is really missing though is a independant and meanstream european fork of Android
Why not **Qwant** which is a European Search Engine unlike DuckDuckGo based on google ?
From the point of view of the EU, no
From the point of view of the citizens and nations within the EU, I think the power the gafam have is a great threat to our privacy and independence and that we should do our best to limit their influence in our lives
It is not about nationalism, it is fighting back against mega corporations that have proved times and times again that they don't care a bit about privacy and want to be monopolistic
No but it is US based and thus is under US jurisdiction
Since snowden revelations about prism, I don't think it is sufficiently protective of privacy
Also, duckduckgo is not a search engine, it merely combines the results of big corporations own search engines
Thus if you want an independent service (or at least one trying to be) located in a place more respectful of your privavy, there is only qwant that I know
Happy reunification day
This day should also be the occasion to remember that [the reunification had an heavy cost that should not be forgotten]
Germany
They lost two world wars, absorbed East Germany and are still one the most developed country in the world
I don't know how they do that
pissing too many people off with comments : my problem with all that isn't the reunion of germany (people circulating is okay esp in Europe) it was that instead of rising it they pretty much economically destroyed the GDR in turn, declaring that it's currency was worth half of west germany, halved citizens accounts, shorted wages then "privatizing" everything closing much for all for scrap; dismantling the welfare and stable jobs and so on
Germany's still picking up the parts today
I notice the same root in Welsh and Basque
Also it's **erc'h** in Breton, a language closely related to Welsh
That’s a very weird way to say snow in Northern Africa
My girlfriend says Santa Claus must come from Hungary, and when he says "Ho Ho Ho" he means "snow snow snow"!
The orientation of the contrast for Belgium is not right
Nice map :)
Hungarian and Basque always gotta be special, huh
Romanians were secretly Inuit this whole time :O
Because the words used don't come from proto-indo-european languages but from proto-italic languages
Destruction: 100
Too late
My guess is by doing that, Boris Johnson is putting pressure on EU for ultimately obtaining a revised deal
It does have flaws, but more than that, it was the perfect scapegoat, and most politicians have been blaming it for their shortcomings, up to the point where too many people hate the EU for actually weak reasons
Don't miss Slovenia
*bus rise from the river*
*Bismark start to play in the background*
> their politicians take credit for all the positives while projecting their screw ups on the EU
And unfortunately, they are not charged for that

I'm Australian and have lived in Berlin, now in France
It hurts how accurate this is
- It's not the being foreign
- It's not the speaking bad French
- It's the not saying "Hi, I am sorry to bother you, can I ask you a question please
Also, foreigners saying this is 100% true, and foreigners saying this is 100% false
It became common because of the English colonies, same for Spanish and French
In most European countries we learn British English in school, not American English
