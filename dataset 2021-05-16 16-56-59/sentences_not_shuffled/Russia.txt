Most Russians actually support their government and especially Pitun
During Leningrad blockade in WW2 people were able to distinguish cannibals by their shining bright eyes
Everyone else were dying of hunger
Not most Russians
Wasn’t 1915 considered as a dark year too
The same happens everywhere all the time
It's stupid to dwell on it
Hold on
Not so fast
Its been only 30 years since the autocratic rule started by Ivan the Terrible ended
They are able to break into your house during the night because you have posted something insulting on your page about the milit
police, senators, something containing swastika or something positive about terrorism
So unless you are a total dumbass, who shouts extremist or outraging things publicly or you pissed autocrats off so much they watch every step of yours looking for a single miatake, or unless you don't use SSL when write antigovernment things, you can sleep peacefully
Yep
Indeed its an imperialistic culture like China or the UK has
But unlike the UK, China and Russia are unfortunate because they suffered significant damage both physically and to the pride
He got lucky
The oil prices in the 2000’s were high, giving him the economic leverage to exact his plans for dilution of the public consciousness
Up until recently, people associated Putin as an anti-liberal, pro-economy guy
The 90’s was a tough time for virtually every Russian, and people wrongly accepted him as the answer to the chaos that preceded him
Putin didn't actively make things worse (before 2012-2014 that is)
Of course the overall positive economic trends did the bulk of heavy lifting, but not interfering with natural progress is the best one can expect from a Russian leader
In case you didn't know it, we have had about 1
5 competent ones over the past 500 years, and all the years of USSR were a particularly nasty shit storm
A lot of fairly reasonable people support Putin because compared to the likes of Yeltsin he does in fact look like a saint, and Yeltsin is far from the worst leader we've had
Yes, we now have oligarchic rule including by actual oligarchs
Breaking news: Putin made a statement, that Russia will be annexed by Mongolia, for economic reasons, certainly not to avoid joining EU lol
At least we could relate with the sudetenland germans now
Legalised abortions in 1920
Even though they were heavily restricted in '36, they weren't completely banned, and were completely legalised later in '54-'55
This or last year Russia introduced financial help for people who have only 1 child
(it's weird to phrase in English, I know) And doubled it for 2+. Before you got financial help and some privileges if you had 2 or more children, now even 1 gives you some of those which is nice
“How dare people brag about making the world a better place
Oh yeah literacy was a problem during Tsardom
Only noble or feudal children were allowed to attend Univercities, peasants could only attend 1st grade of some low-quality schools
I'm not very hopeful; I think he's a populist who craves people's approval first and foremost
I don't expect him to actually hold any principles he'll stick to
If he delivers a hard Brexit I'll be satisfied
It's just a case of holding out until October, I suppose
But I don't see how he can do any better than May did - she shafted the whole thing with that election bomb
Im laughing but i know our polititians are worse
> n the context of Brexit it highers the chances of a no-deal (because that's still the default outcome) if things won't find a faster gear
For me to be satisfied, that's all he really needs to do - stay in power long enough for that to tick over
I don't trust him any further than I could throw him, though
The man doesn't hold any principles he'll put before his own popularity
She had hope she could make a difference to help the country she loves
Everyone can understand and respect that
I dont give farage and Bojo that much credit
She faced more pressure than most leader will ever experience
She held the fate and union of her country in her hands against the biggest union of countries, with no preparation time
Name another leader who did that
Words have meaning
I know, in USA, that not always the case anymore
You happened to use yours to undermine her quality as leader because she was pressured
It is simply ridiculous
>heads of state or government have had to deal with much bigger issues than Brexit
Oh they did
Funny that you saved yourself the trouble to name any example then
Get back when you will have anything worthy to add
Two paragraphs and still nothing interesting said
If you are not going to back up your claim, that is ok to not make any at all
Mass falsifications in all major elections, evidence of which is on the Internet, but everyone doesn’t care about it
Edit: For example Putin's illegitimate third presidential term (2012-2018) and fourth presidential term (2018-2024)
In fairness, the average Italian soldier did really well in both wars measured against what he had to work with
Payback for Arminius destroying those Legions in Teutoberg Forest
Turncoats reap a turncoat's fate
Yeah, he f*cked us pretty bad at Narva and then ignored Peter's frantic peace offers while he went down to Poland to punish his treacherous cousin, the elector of Saxony
FWIW you still won most of the fights we had after
Well an argument could be made that neither was Russia/USSR in either war
In both, we were heavily dependent on western countries sending us materiel
And in WW1, we got sick of it -- sick enough that we listened to Lenin and co
And yeah, I don't even have to elaborate on the state of training for the average Russian conscript
We still did well enough
Give yourselves some credit
When you got your shit together you kicked ass
You live in a crumbling wooden house built by your grandfather when this area was still a village
It has electricity but the water needs to be gathered from the well
You wake up early in the morning and walk to the bus stop that looks like a Fallout prop, so that a bus produced in 1980s can take you to the equally old warehouse where you just carry various crates and sacks around until it's time to leave
It's the end of the month, so you receive your paycheck
It's approximately $200 but you need to survive for the entire month on it
If things get bad, you can borrow some money from your friend who got lucky to be employed as a mechanic and earns $300
Anyway, time to buy some food and take a bus home before it gets dark
You sit on the rotten sofa you inherited from your dad, pour yourself a glass of vodka to forget your troubles and turn on the TV that you bought 15 years ago
They are showing the news program
The president, sitting in the middle of his golden palace, for the 20th year in a row tells you that the country will soon become the leader of the world economy
You feel that your throat starts to ache
That's bad but it's already too late to go to the hospital and they would just either give some aspirin to you (that you luckily have at home) or that young naive doctor will prescribe you that modern shit that costs a quarter of your salary per 10 pills
You are not legally considered poor
Lol, thanks guys
That's the nicest thing anyones ever said about us
Orwellian means total control
This man can go around calling Putin swine all day long
Nothing will change in his life
Which is horrible enough
Not that meme again
Yeah, it's happened to me a few times while travelling
My "active" vocabulary in Russian would get too repetitive and limited, and I would sometimes use an awkward turn of phrase
Felt deeply embarrassed because of it
I guess, it's because I am surrounded by my native language's environment all the time
But probably even if I wasn't, I would still not forget my mother tongue
It's a mother tongues, after all
When you study other languages sometimes constructions that these languages use may pop up in your head earlier than they do for your own language
That can be really annoying at times
Sometimes I end up saying words in a weird order like I've only learned how to talk yesterday because of that
I'm not even from Europe and my first language is Russian but I'd say yes
Not that often as people might imagine but it happens
Especially when you know that you might say a sentence way shorter but you gotta use your native language cuz nobody in your group of people would understand English
The mother tongue can still be forgotten if you don’t practice it
I am not competent in this, but I think, though can't say for sure, that this is probably relevant only for children, not for adults
Yes, it depends at what age do you move from your country, but anyway without practice you will get bad
I think that I neither like it, nor dislike it
I just accept it as one of those unique things that make me somehow distinguishable from other people who speak English
My accent is not immensely strong, though
Probably, if it had been stronger and if it had been harder for other people to understand my speech because of it, I would have seen my accent more pessimistically
One thing I learned from this thread is that hating the typical accent of your country seems to be a universal thing lol
I find Icelandic accent absolutely majestic (as well as Swedish, Norwegian and other Scandi ones), in fact, the thicker the better, but apparently native speakers don't enjoy it much lol
It's an interesting pattern
In a weird way it makes me feel better about my own accent
I mean, you never know, maybe some people in some country somewhere actually genuinely love it lol
Bc iphones (at least newer ones) cost a fucking fortune
The most popular phones here are cheap chinese stuff for under 20k rubles from Xiaomi, Huawei and what-not
I don't know does it counts, because this city in asian part of Russia, but Russia is still European country so
I'm ashamed of Omsk
This city is ugly, dirty, people are too agressive and this is one of poorest cities
There are some other cities like Vorkuta, Chita and Magadan but they are not as popular as Omsk
Serbia isn't even the poorest country in the Balkans
Albania and Bosnia are both poorer from memory
Alcoholic suck up to busy trying to be in charge than actually doing their job
Security guard who sits at the front desk and watches you fumble with your keycard
Some find him creepy, but he insists he's just doing his job
I always believed stereotypes were real
I expected everyone to have a shotgun and eat burgers lol
I honestly love Italian food traditions, I think the whole pizza for one person in only common in Italy:)
As is the “no cappuccino after noon” rule
See, you are open to sharing in theory:)
First time huh
Nope
Im fully sure that Azarov and company were just paid by building companies
Graveries of ancient turks- bulgarians are being desecrated too
Ok im adding Werhaboo to my list of awesome insults
I think in Russian it would be "доброжир" (dobrozhir)
Literally this means: dobro - good/kind, zhir - fat
But "zhir" part here means "plenty/so much".
So dobrozhir named person is very kindly
P.S. We also share lots of old Slavic and old Byzantine names with other Slavic countries
So there is a good chance that you find some similarities
Names that end with -slav or -mir (Svyatoslav or Vladimir for example)
For the UK
Godfrey and Gladice
Hmm, I'd say Yaropok for men and Zlata for women
Miroslav isn't that old timey
I know two people have this name and are alive
Be ready to get your economics devoured by China and USA
Salmon is easily my favorite fish for sushi
Flounder is a distant second
Same shit here
Also "Ukraine bad" etc
I have two favourite pieces
The first one is that they have forbidden speaking Russian, which is funny, considering that ≥50% of Ukrainians speak Russian with family and friends and that even their president doesn't speak Ukrainian well
The second is that they have invented their own version of history in which all humanity is descended from "Ancient Ukrs" which suggests somehow that Ukrainians are the purest Aryan race
Yeah, I know about the first one, although it would not be feasible in the Eastern regions where most of the locals speak Russian almost exclusively
Anyway, it's not "forbidding speaking Russian".
About the second one, it's not taken out of the blue
There are a few Ukrainian nationalists who propagate this idea, but our media takes it to a whole new level by stating that this is accepted all over Ukraine and that they teach that in school
I not know about what to talk, so here excerpt from "Master and Margarita":
>Any visitor, if he, of course, was not at all dumb, getting in Gribojedov, at once savvied, how well live luckies - members of MASSOLIT, and black envy started immediately torment him
And immediately as well he addressed to sky bitter reproaches for that, that it not awarded him when born \[with\] literary talent, without what, naturally, notwhat was and dream to take possession of MASSOLIT ticket, brown, smelling with expensive leather, with golden wide border, - known to all Moscow ticket
Original:
>Всякий посетитель, если он, конечно, был не вовсе тупицей, попав в Грибоедова, сразу же соображал, насколько хорошо живется счастливцам – членам МАССОЛИТа, и черная зависть начинала немедленно терзать его. И немедленно же он обращал к небу горькие укоризны за то, что оно не наградило его при рождении литературным талантом, без чего, естественно, нечего было и мечтать овладеть членским МАССОЛИТским билетом, коричневым, пахнущим дорогой кожей, с золотой широкой каймой, – известным всей Москве билетом.
Not very understandable how to translate cases and forms of verbs - to ignore them or to use prepositions (how, usually, and do when translation)
Don’t think that this is a good idea because from trying to think like that my brain hurts
I decided show cases in own example-preposition
Onexample, yesterday when I exited from gym-birth, me self-arrived go home under rain-create
I obliged was buy TV guide-blame for my MIL-birth, but I went straight home
While today rain-birth no, (it) was worth would outspring out home-birth on minute and buy it-blame
English not perfect language
At him no some aspects of speech which is at other languages
As example, at him no cases and endings of Russian or other slavic languages
For me easy show this, that is in English, but no in Russian, but difficult show this, that no in English
May be, Latin be would more appropriate example
Honestly, this much more understandable, than that, that write Dutchmen
You clearly not follow rules, because you is/have articles
You where found articles in Ukrainian
They are only in Bulgarian
If natrix write on-own, then on-own
Lingua latina non penis canis est
Articles - invention of devil
Peoples of world should together fight against this language plague
Everything normal, and then bam - New Zealand
>We should it over of everything and still something could have
Too many auxiliaries, I nothing not understand
Why you them so many
We in Russian without them somehow live, and nothing, everything normal, understand each other
Reverse-translit, that's what i like
If everyone else boycotts, it's the only chance to win with our national team's level :(
We had this guy called [Viktor Chernomyrdin] Idk how much stupid things he'd *done*, but he *said* a lot of ...stuff, like:
* I won't talk much, or I'll say something again
* We always can to can
* It has never been like this and now it is exactly the same again
* If I'm a jew, what am I to be shy of
I'm, however, not a jew
* We will be destroying our nuclear weapons together with America
* We completed all objectives (points): from A to B
* There was no war
There were only questions
* Forecasting is a difficult thing, especially when you're talking about future
* I have approximately 2 sons
* Teachers and doctors want to eat almost every day
* There's a catastrophe in Yugoslavia
Catastrophe is always a bad thing
* We wanted the best, but it turned out like always
And much much more, he has a huge article on [Russian Wikiquote] Sadly, there are just 3 quotes on the English one
"We have no money left but hang in there" — Dmitry Medvedev said this in front of people in 2016
Former (Prime Minister and President) of Russia
Well we do stereotype Germany as a place where anything not explicitly permitted is implicitly prohibited ;)
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a right wing politician who is considered our Donald Trump, called Condoleezza Rice a *“a black whore who needs a good cock
Send her here, one of our divisions will make her happy in the barracks one night
She will choke on Russian sperm as it will be leaking out of her ears ... until she crawls to the US embassy in Moscow on her knees
Yes, this is a direct translation from his [Wikipedia] page
[Here is the og video
That was shot in 2003
For some reason this didn’t ruin his career, he’s still in the Duma TODAY
There is an article in Russian Crime Code: Article 210
Occupation of the Supreme Position in a Criminal Hierarchy
You may get up to15 years of prison
Could we refloat the Victory, load her up with paintball cannons and send her off to clobber some dons for a second time
It became an idiom in Russian
Hell no
That's the place I dream of visiting
Also the birthplace of tons of great musicians
Haven’t heard of him
If such things were commercially viable, they'd attract investment
Given that even the UK doesn't have proper high speed rail (despite the government trying to push it on us), I can only assume flights are more economical for tourism
And high speed rail isn't necessary for moving freight
You don't even necessarily need speeds that high: overnight transportation in a sleeper coach is as close to teleportation as you could get, plus you save on one night of hotel costs
They are not mutually exclusive, thankfully
The Moscow-SaintP rail in Russia sees a ton of traffic and has both high speed and sleeper options (although the cheapest sleepers take 10+h as they tend to sit on the side rails letting other trains past)
Maybe
I just like to sleep in coaches so much that I would take overnight train even if the high speed one was the same price (and Moscow-SaintP is a shorter route than Berlin-Paris)
It's also quite hard to fit high speed trains into the rail schedule riddled with commercial trains that generally don't go that fast
But whatever, trains are amazing anyway
I never find it
Sometimes I think that Russians don’t use Reddit
As for Russia, there are no such ads I remember (almost all charities in Russia are focused on saving poor Russian children), but there is a long-lasting stereotype about starving African kids
I believe ads about African children would be met with aggression and annoyance in our society
At least when Putin aids some African country, the common reaction I witness is "How dare he spend money on others when people's lives here are so bad
I think ignorance can be explained more easily: people just don't hear anything about what's going in Ghana
I have to admit I know absolutely nothing about Ghana and never had any motivation to learn either
Only Moscow and St
Petersburg live fairly well, and to some extent other large cities like Novosibirsk, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, or Nizhny Novgorod (where I live), but they are already significantly below Moscow and St
Petersburg
The rest of Russia is a complete disaster for the most part
All polls show that the main concern of Russia's population is economical well-being constantly going down, and even events like Crimea annexation have lost their positive effect on their outlook
Some statistical info: the official median monthly wage in Russia is ~€500, 20 million people (every 7th Russian) live below the poverty threshold (~€150/month)
Every 3rd Russian can't afford a second pair of shoes, every 4th Russian has to cut their food expenses
If vacation plans are any indication: 80% of Russians don't travel anywhere, only 4% travel abroad
Some people live in horrible conditions in ancient crumbling buildings with no amenities, e.g. [see this post] from Arkhangelsk (unfortunately, I know several buildings in a similar state in my city)
Also, the quality of life is not only in personal income
I'm a wealthy person by Russian standards, I have sufficient money for almost everything I want (except real estate), but you can't buy good infrastructure
The infrastructure is simply garbage in most cities and towns
Horrendous public transport, streets always covered in sand and dirt, absolutely no regard for low mobility people: that's how I would describe my city, the 6th largest one in Russia
Free healthcare is crumbling under lack of funding, almost all people who have money don't ever use free healthcare
E.g., [read about the experiences] of a dancer from Iceland who is married to a Russian guy in a Russian hospital in Penza
And [here] some photos from a hospital in wealthy Moscow
And some personal experiences: when my grandmother was hospitalized with some heart condition, she spent several days in a corridor because there were no vacant places in rooms
The same happened to my close friend, except the corridor was in addition horribly cold
And in his entire one month in the hospital, he took a shower exactly zero times due to being disgusted with its state
And this decadence is seen everywhere, in education, in public services, and so on
Poorest: voids around Moscow and St Pete, especially Ivanovo oblastj (used to have lots of textile factories, couldn't beat Turkish imports) and Pskov oblastj (next to Estonia)
The richest are Moscow, St Pete, southern Russia where the agriculture is and the cities in Siberia built around oil/gas fields and metalworks
Vehicle
I couldnt pronounce it right untill 17
Its just black speech for me
It's a bit of a typical one to throw around on Reddit, but as a native speaker I was surprised that we have such a specific verb as "defenestration
Also, does it have a German root
I can see a relationship with a particular German word there
"Blowjob" - I thought it's about explosions or something
I think at some point they just pretended that it is a word but they liked it and decided to keep
On twitch channels get banned for this, but in russian guess what
Its a racial name
So yeah you cant say a name of the race
Isnt it racism
Вехикл)
I pronounced it in childhood like this
Depends on culture/language of whom you communicating with
In English it's better to stick with paradigm of no to N word
"Стул" is for actual chair without backpart in Russian
And also used for feces
Табурет! But it's like стул but without backpart
Я был типа: зыс из а рэд вот это вот слово
Since Twitch is presented in Russia, they have own staff/mods here and full Russian localization - they should
In Moscow it is only getting colder
I envy your weather so much
Maybe winters aren't so harsh but we have the longest and shittiest 0-10 C Autumn/Spring
\+27
Just for sure
This year I saw New Year decoration about a week ago
It was mid October
Troodos
There is mo anti-German sentiment
There is some generally anti-western but not specifically anti-German
Edit: I hope I’m not being too optimistic lol
Not really
Germans are seen as sincere, hardworking and no-nonsense people, which are all very attractive traits
They are easy to communicate with and conduct business with (in contrast with Latin Europeans and Asians, for example) I have come across people who have expressed their dislike towards Germany, but they are few and far between
Commodities produced in Germany are known for their quality and so are the services - education, medicine, etc
People are, however, aware of the anti-Russian sentiment present in Europe in general, and in Germany specifically
No, not really
Younger generations don't care too much about history
Older people have mostly moved on
There's a lot of WWII-related dick waving, but it's not specifically anti-German, despite slogans like "To Berlin
" on cars
There's a lot of envy, though, "these Germans have their shit together, while we can't do anything properly".
I live in uptown Moscow and if it wasn’t some fever dream that I had, our alarm systems are being tested sometimes and they sound exactly like what you’d expect to hear when there’s a nuclear ICBM incoming
And I was hoping that you’d say that you ended up getting laid
Bummer
The fact that Absolut is Swedish and not Russian isn't really known to a lot of people surprisingly
I guess because the noun is identical in both languages
Russia: 5
1% from every salary is paid to the fund
Healthcare is universal, but good luck if you're living outside big city: there may be simply no doctor
Or, there may be no drugs for your disease
Or, you may have orphan disease and doctors will say they can't do anything but IRL it will be because drugs will cost too much
Medical staff salaries among the lowest
Funding is shady as fuck
There is a lot of ways for corruption
Wanna see a surgeon, well you can't, because they scheduled prior to 2025
Personal experience with Russian healthcare:
They managed not notice meningitis despite specific rash
Free wards look like there was no renovation since the building is build, wanna some basic comfort like warm room
Pay extra
Had to remove a toenail: three weeks of pending, six months after the surgery had to be redone in paid clinics
Dentists: you just go to paid clinics cause they have a choice of anaesthetics and modern stuff
Even if you live in a big city, there's two weeks queue to visit a therapist
If you need to be hospitalized sometimes it's up to two months queue (it's like that in my 650000 citizens city for gastroenterology and neurology)
Did a checkup in December, photofluorography thing in my clinic was broken, I was sent to another clinic but it didn't work there too
I thought fuck it and went to paid clinic
>Or, there may be no drugs for your disease
But there's a shit ton of magic pills like Arbidol, Kagocel, etc
Who the hell thinks Finns are Russians
It isn't just an Anglosphere thing
I always find it funny when people on Reddit say "only Anglos do X" because most of the time it's far from true
I've tried to describe the situation in Russia, but I can't put it well into words
So a couple of unstructured remarks: many people say hello, many don't, and it isn't a big deal
Oftentimes, the staff actually greets you first
And there are many situations where greetings aren't expected and where not saying hello is actually more polite than doing so
And I've had the same experience in a lot of places in Russia and Eastern Europe
So, if a Russian tourist doesn't greet a shop worker France, it isn't because they lack manners
They just don't know they're expected to
And they can feel awkward saying hello in a foreign language, which adds to hesitation
> I've tried to describe the situation in Russia, but I can't put it well into words
Yeah, it's complicated
If the shopkeeper is doing business with another customer: definitely no greeting, I will greet them when my turn is up
If the shopkeeper is just talking with another customer and I don't know either of them: definitely no greeting, or they might interpret this as "shut your trap and service an actual customer"
If it's a self-service grocery store where a single till is right next to the entrance, definitely a greeting even if the teller is talking to someone
If it's one of these mini-markets where there are multiple small shops in a single room: definitely no greeting until I reach the counter of the shop I need
Talking to a supermarket cashier: definitely a greeting before saying anything when I reach them, but not when I enter the store
Talking to a shop assistant hanging around a large supermarket or a department store: an "excuse me" is fine unless they are manning an information kiosk, then a greeting is better
I would say that Ukrainian understandable for Russians on 70-80% from the beginning and after a couple of days of hearing 100% understandable
Speaking is completely another thing
Or being a North Korean who doesn't like military parades
It will survive, if you add russian gene
Not really, I did say that my great grandfather was killed in 1939 by a Finnish sniper to random Finns on reddit outside of any context a couple of times but that’s about it
A lot of ppl pray
Un-fucking-ironically
Божынька памаги мни здать екзамины!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, there's no time for pranks before exams
Cocainum is a meme
The other guys speak more or less right, but have a very strange intonation, that make it is sound completely foreign
Didn't know that they were Georgian
The first one might be going for Gerogian accent
But they all make vowels sound too long
This is very common for Europeans and Americans
We don’t have mountains but somehow when I am in the mountains there is an urge to do it
I assume digital piracy
Everyone who knows how to use a torrent pirates
Nobody is ever punished for it and nobody ever feels bad about it
There were attempts to block torrent trackers, but it is easy to bypass with a VPN
С новым годом! :)
Finally, there will be no questions about Christmas (hopfully)
Too late
To leave like an Englishman (to take English leave)— to leave without saying goodbye
I think the French came up with that
Американские горки (literally "American small mountains") is a Russian name for roller-coaster
I've heard that some countries use the same phrase, but with "Russian" instead of "American".
And we have “Chinese literacy” meaning “It’s all Greek to him” in English
The same in Russian
Every single movie with Russian protagonist from Hollywood
They rarely do bother to have a good russian actor
I can’t understand a single sentence of Asian who speaks English
Their English accent is so tough
And if we’re talking about Russian language I have never misunderstood foreigner or never thought that he speaks another language
Maybe because Russian language is unique and it’s hard to mix it up
In movies/tv shows when someone who doesn't speak Russian, has to say something in Russian, it's almost always gibberish
They replace McDonald's workers with janitors mostly
If you will not study well, you will go to the plant or become a janitor
That's right
McDonald's jokes are reserved for humanities graduates
The President is not some master strategist with a cunning plan
He's a gambler who is usually very lucky
That is it
I had to explain to a group of junior highschoolers The Soviet union collapsed in 90's. They actually thought the Soviet union was still going
We don't have toast 'Na zdorovie'. Na zdorovie is a polite answer on Thank you
Like
\- Here is your \*something\* / Вот твоё что-нибудь
\- Thank you / Спасибо
\- To your health / На здоровье
Drinking toast is "Za zdorovie" - "For the health". I have no idea where foreigners find information about "Na zdorovie" but everybody repeat the same mistake
To be honest, it's often described as going *through* Berlin, not *around* West Berlin
And even fewer people know about the other wall that separated the GDR from the FRG
I’ve had reindeer carpaccio
Medvedev ragequit like a week ago so for the moment, the other one
I know that Romanian and Italian are similar to each other
Is this right
Based on extremely dodgy math which includes Soviet casualties in WWII in Stalin's total death count
It's between Canada at the top and Mexico at the bottom
Alaska is next to Hawaii, in two boxes to the left
I think Germany made a really good choice on mandatory vaccinations as it could stop plagues from happening . I think mandatory vaccination is a life saver as vaccines give you immunity to diseases that are already cureable from an early age
Hot dog is called "Sausage in dough" in Russian
Unfortunately, the form used means dough is spelled just like father-in-law
The result is
In Russian Institute of protein is Институт белка, where’s белка is genitive for белок (protein) since word белка has another meaning, we was the only country with Institute of squirrel [source]
Deathproof movie in Russian is called “Доказательство смерти”, which means “proof of death”
English and Russian translations from Turkish resorts are a whole other meme category here
This sounds better than "Смертестойкий" imo
It is father-in-law who has sausage in him
Can't argue with father-in-law
That was like 10 years ago or more
Google Translate was very poor even 5 years ago
But the name ”Доказательство смерти” doesn’t have anything to do with the movie
Deathproof is a really silly movie and “Смертестойкий” or some other option would fit it a lot better
I haven't checked the news yet, so that's the first time I hear that
I hope it will lead to a better future for Kazakhstan
Though it seems that he still will have plenty of power as the *leader of nation*.
Why did he resigned
There is a very rare achievment fro ruling for 30+ years
>but even actual ethnic Russians don’t really face it there
Yeah, as someone from a Russian/Korean family that left Kazakhstan in the 90s, I'm gonna say no to that
Things have mellowed out since then and Kazakhstan is the best Central Asian country in that regard, but there's a reason overwhelming majority of emigration from Kazakhstan is Slavic
Also, Kazakhstan is building a nation state, so their desire to keep people who aren't ethnic Kazakhs far away from power is completely logical and I don't fault them for that
But you can miss me with all that non-discrimination talk
Yeah I think party tourism would be annoying
I’m glad that the places where I lived all my life got a better class of tourists
Obviously biased, but I always like going to the Russian memorabilia stores
Just because I like to see the version of Russian culture that is presented in other countries
3 posts later: It's time to reignite Finnish-Korean hyperwar
I just googled "русские рождаются с" ("Russians are born with"), and it showed [exactly this question] from 13 years ago:
> They say that Norwegians are born with skis on their feet
Then what are Russians born with
The answers:
> With love for good books, good ballet and matryoshkas (traditional Russian dolls)
> With a bottle of vodka
> With a bottle of vodka
Too primitive
Russians are born with a great Russian soul
(there's a cliche concept of the "Russian soul" that basically captures all peculiarities of Russian mentality)
Lmao, yes it is
There's no way it can be discussed other than with vodka at 2am
Yeah, I've seen/heard the same comments from foreigners, but I didn't know it was specific to Russia before that
Reading is really encouraged here, and someone who doesn't read/hasn't read a lot is considered a bit uncultured
The piano and fine arts are also mildly popular (not that everyone is into that, but it definitely seems more common than in most other countries)
It is only a little popular
Basically everyone knows how to play chess, but only a few have a habit
According to my grandparents, when they were young, virtually everyone would play chess
That's because we didn't have mobile phones back then
How is the relationship between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in BiH right now
Are there plenty of inter-marriages, or do people stick to their own ethnicities
Damn
There are many
But let's say Chelyabinsk or Omsk
To me it literally looks like a regular town lol
You guys all tripping
I looked up all the 'ugly' cities mentioned in this thread and they all seem perfectly cute to me
Bella Italia indeed
Same in Russian
Glina sure sounds like a fun place lmao
I liked Kharkov
I'd say Vorkuta
[Chita] comes to mind too
What does the first article of your constitution say
Ours is
> **Article 1**
>The Russian Federation - Russia is a democratic federal law-bound State with a republican form of government
>The names "Russian Federation" and "Russia" shall be equal
And personally I find it very funny that naming goes before anything else
Post inspired by the guy who has "Russian Federation" instead of "Russia" in their flair
[Full text of our constitution here]
Is there a lot of them
Yeah, I remembered seeing a similar question some time ago
Figured it has been enough time since to ask it again
Plus, it's not really the same question, in many cases answer to it is a preamble, not the first article
Nah, the Soviet one of 1977 is better, [the preamble is something]
I had my understanding of race shattered when I had a portugese and turk side by side and the turk almost fit in the Russian definition of white while the portugese would easily be seen as black or at best a gypsy here
Permanent population of depressive far northern cities like Vorkuta
Awful weather, valueless property and health problems if they still manage to somehow move to the south
Yep, looked up their real estate market, found a studio apartment for roughly a thousand euros
And very decent flats for 400-500k roubles (5-6k euros), even the furniture I saw in those photos could cost more
Fuck, there's no way out, even if you own a place, you can't sell it to have somewhat okayish start anywhere else
i was looking for russian's comment just to make sure that someone mentioned checnya, but you didn't. Vorkuta isn't even close as bad as southern regions
Same tbh
Well, they're different and the majority there is probably fine with it, it may be weird from our perspective and also given those terrible human rights violations, Russia is pretty messed up in that regard but it's still like comparing Finland to Saudi Arabia
Russian laws do not work there, 99% of us would feel like foreigners there, we just cannot relate
But depressing places like Vorkuta, Chita or Magadan is a different and close matter
Yeah, Chechnya is definitely at the top of my list
So much blood and violence and now they have this disgrace of a tyrant there
Russians claim Chechens to be their country mates it at the same time to not provide with federal law and protection against the Kadyrov clique
But if federals roll with full force again in would be seen for everyone as invasion again
Damn if you do and damn if you don’t.
Major and recent event that often flies under the radar is  [  . It wasn't just constitutional crisis - it involved tanks and snipers and machinegun fire with over 180 people killed
As a result Yeltsin blasted the Parlaiment (then still Supreme Soviet, so it was the end of Soviet rule) with tanks and pushed through constitution that greatly expanded his power
Many say that this event forever undermined Russian democracy
However Yeltsin was supported by most world powers because they feared return of commies
Yeltsin's popularity steadily fell after this event and first Chechen war, and in 1996 elections majority voted for communist party, but Yeltsin and his team used many underhanded methods to win the election, which was probably the nail in a coffin of Russian democracy
Ever since power has been held by the same group with no prospect of change
Thanks to Victoria 2, I know that
Lol i learned who Borbrikov was from song "Niet Molotoff"
While there are no false statements in your comment -- indeed, there was a war, and Bolsheviks had to throw away their idea that workers of every nation would help them fight the bourgeoisie in future wars, -- your comment creates an impression that the warmongering USSR attacked Poland, while it was the other way around
I agree that England's treatment of the Irish is something that should be more widely talked about, but I'm going to echo the other reply in saying that I don't think Brits look to Cromwell as a hero nowadays
I imagine a typical Joe Bloggs' thoughts on Cromwell would be "that grumpy dour bloke who wanted to be painted warts and all and tried to ban Christmas, right
It was an interesting time
I always liked the sheer variety of opinions - like in Ukraine alone there was half a dozen factions
In Poland there were nation-state supporters and "old commonwealth" supporters, on Russian side there were Reds and Whites and local peasant uprisings and "brigand states" with petty dictators and puppets of English/French/USA/Japanese interventions and then you have ethnic nationalists on the outskirts, home varieties of reds and whites in Finland and Baltic states, German freikorps joining the fun etc
The whole "Collapse of Russian Empire" topic is underrated AF
Yes
But it has become quite obsolete, unfortunately
The only way to play it nowadays is by using mods that improve gameplay
Yes, i was like "Who is that Bobrikov
This is not true
Yes, China was quite volatile from 1911 to 1949
The original battle royale
We have a language inside our language
Swear-word language is so rich that you theoretically can live entire your life and don't say any non-swear-word
I suppose that builders very near to this theoretical limit:)
Russian has something similar, called “toska”
in France they do that too
Of course I mean only verbs, adverbs, adjectives and nouns
Your phrase could be told like that may be:
"Попиздовали с псиной срать"
In theory, you can
It is the same in Russian
But dual form is before five
1 стол - 1 stol - 1 table
2 стола - 2 stola - 2 tables
3 стола - 3 stola - 3 tables
4 стола - 4 stola - 4 tables
5 столов - 5 stolov - 5 tables
6 столов - 6 stolov - 6 tables
Etc
Actually, I don't know but there is a couple of tricks that make this task possible
Word херня(khernya) -  it means literally everything you can imagine(no matter concrete or non-concrete)
The only thing you need to give more context with your gestures or other words so that it is clear what exactly you are trying to say with this word
Linvo-phallic reduplication
Add хуй-(or хуи-/хуя-/хуе-) to any word
The most famous example is the song of the Leningrad band - Yoghurts
"Сникерсы-сникерсы, сникерсы-хуикерсы. Баунти-баунти, баунти-хуяунти." (Snickers-snickers, snickers-khooikers, Bounty-bounty, Bounty-Khooyaoonty)
In real life, anybody, of course, will use a work park in your example but in theory, he can say it without this word
I'm so happy for your country now
But O-Zone is from Moldova
Istanbul
It even has "islands" to be unlocked
Chelyabinsk, the Vice city of Russia basically
A vast amount of cities which could be the location for GTA 6, but I would like it to be some of German cities
London or Paris are banal for this role, but it would be great to mention Hamburg/Frankfurt/Munich/Düsseldorf
It would be much better if whole GTA 6 will took place in Europe and missions will convey from one to another country
It would be some up-to-date move
I'd pick modern-day Saint-Petersburg
Venice or St
Petersburg or Amsterdam
More canals
Moscow would be great
Such a rushed and disappointing ending; really felt like the game had just run out of money
And the main story didn't even seem to use 90% of the landmass; I thought I must be less than halfway through the game and it just
finishes
Arbat street in Moscow
It was the only pedestrianized street in the USSR for a long time, and it has nothing special to offer these days
Just lots of gift shops and street artists preying on tourists who haven't updated their knowledge of Moscow since the 1980s.
I don't drink vodka, don't have a tracksuit, don't listen hardbass, don't drive a lada, don't play cs:go, I didn't even hack american capitalists
So, I guess I'm not very good at being a cliche Russian
I have a simple haircut, don't smile at random strangers
I don't drink vodka or tea, don't have a dashcam, don't like banâ/sauna, don't go crazy with venerating our WWII vets, don't have a tracksuit
Well, I'm into chess and figure skating, I drink A LOT of tea, the household I live in has a cat (and so do households of most of my friends)
But perhaps the most Russian thing is that I love picking wild mushrooms
It might not be a widely known cliche, but it's a fact that most Russians couldn't care less about politics, and I mostly share this attitude
I really like buckwheat and eat it every now and then
And I also drink tea all day long when I'm staying at home not going anywhere
Apart from that, I can't think of anything off the top of my head, though there could be more, for sure
> don't have a tracksuit
You can't be *that* uncultured, can you
>  suffered from the Soviets and I'm not a Russophile
Soviets and Russians are not the same
Wait, is the kissing stereotype really a thing in Italy
I have to admit, I've never heard of it before
Apparently, the imagery of Soviet leaders has left quite a mark on the collective Italian mind
When I want to watch a rug, I switch to [Kover TV] (Rug TV) channel
Red Sparrow comes to mind right away
It's like someone wasn't notified the Cold War ended and decided mix the biggest stereotypes about Russia, excessive romance and Jennifer Lawrence into a film
It's always gloomy and snowing in Russia, everyone's either a spy or almost a spy ready to die for the Party and for some reason there are still communist banners and that shit all around the country like it's still the USSR (according to the film it's supposed to be modern day Russia)
It's not that the film is bad per se but it's so full of that cringy stuff that it's difficult to watch
We even have the term клюква (klyukva) for all that stereotypical portrayal of Russia abroad
But Red Sparrow is like beyond the regular cringe - it's so bad in that regard it's almost comical
But I'm certain there is a whole bunch of films and tv shows like that which is something we kinda have to get used to, sometimes it's even funny like in John Wick
Turns out there is a site about Russian culture for foreigners and they have [some kind of article about that]
There's been a minor shitstorm on Twitter about Anastasia, a recent direct-to-video(?) movie from Disney where the eponymous daughter of Nicholas II escapes through time into 80's America
She's portrayed as clueless about civilization as Ariel the mermaid
My personal disfavourite move is Air Force One with Ford
Hitman and Die Hard 4 and whatever number that Rocky movie had are laughably bad, but AF1 manages to portait Russia as an American puppet state whose leaders are willing to break their own laws because the US is in trouble
They should have used grey filter to make everything look run down and depressing
Half of those stereotypes are quite valid
Yeah, but much of this urban development is semi-derelict brutalist accommodation that looks like a prison
Like, many soviet schools, public buildings, hospitals, summer camps, dormitories etc
look like this
To begin, there is no Finland at all
There is just a Baltic sea
That Stalin didn't know about Gulag
His inferiors concealed it from him
In handwriting almost everyone here writes "α". I personally write "A", just smaller in size, and the same for the other letters
They used to do so
until our president decided to joke a little, too in 2014
Of course I have, really wish Belarus all the best
Armenia is democratic now, while being Russian ally
Kyrgyzstan is also pretty democratic at the moment while also being in the Russian sphere
I don’t know why you think Moscow gives two fucks about political system in the country
The only thing it wants is for the elite of the country to follow their lead
Especially if we are talking about Belarus, where Lukashenko and his authority arguably were the only roadblock in front of Russian “reincorporation”.
I am reading all of this and I start to get the feeling that America is stuck in the 60s ideologically
Like everything that I read here is what I would expect from a film telling me about 20th century US
Fear of communism, military obsession, supersized food, flags everywhere, no unions, people relying on tips etc
Feels like it's stuck in time
You get 3 days off paid plus 2 optional unpaid for:
- your wedding
- the birth of your child
- the death of close kin
No paid leave for moving
Do you
do you actually think that only Scandinavians have to deal with that
Yeah I heard this is a huge problem with Scandinavia
About paragrafryttare, I think it suits more Swiss and Germans
People who go abroad are generally much friendlier, maybe because those who travel tend to be more open minded
Or because they try to make some friends themselves
I thought it would be easy to be friends with Japanese and Koreans because I had some friends from there in college, but once you actually go to East Asia, it’s nearly impossible
Bruh I’m sure that going from south to north, there’s some territory in Scandinavia where it sucks the most ass because it’s already really dark but there is still no good Scandinavian winter aesthetics lol
I’ve had this problem in other countries as well
Minimum wage workers in Coffee shops speak perfect English, but high paid doctors and bankers don’t speak any
People might be exaggerating problems with Swedish politics but it doesn’t mean that there are no problems
And there sure are some fucking problems
Yeah same, it’s the kind of people who just can’t stand those who don’t always act as it written word by word in the law
brrrr
Brazilians are up there with Mexicans and Colombians for sure
Also I find that even genuine connection is harder to get in places like that
Sure the superficial chit chat in Southern Europe and Latin America may seem shallow, but it can evolve into genuine friendships
I’ve kept in touch with people I met randomly outside
In Russian there is a word, that is borrowed directly from English: "суперстар" that means exactly that "a superstar", but there is a Russian word "стар", that looks like English "star", nut means "old".
So one can say "Я стар, я просто суперстар", that will mean "I am old, I am just a superstar".
Meanwhile in Russia there more news about what is happening in Ukraine(but now there's more about Belarus) than news about what is happening in Russia
Yes, Russian TV-news mostly about other countries than about Russia itself
It's like "If you don't speak about problems, they don't exist".
The Netherlands probably
Germany
It’s the best country to live for me
Iceland
Beautiful
Switzerland
The place is so pretty
It's better than an authoritarian government, homophobia and commieblocks
Ill wait for citizens of St Petersburg
We just left an Orlando airport on a rented car
There was a black woman at the pay toll
When she heard us speaking unknown for her language she asked : "what language are you speaking
". I said "Russian". Her next question really shocked me: " soooo, you're from Germany,  right
". Come on, don't you know the results of WWII
P.S. it's off topic to be honest, but just wanted to share
Typical "FrEnglish" burns my ears but, since I can't speak French, I feel like I don't have the right to complain
Probably said you're strong because Bjork and The Mountain from GoT are the only Icelanders anyone knows, lol
To offer a counter-argument; it is pretty annoying to be subjected to a language you can't understand in a public chat
If you wanted to speak to your brother directly, you could've just used Discord or something, no
Why should the whole lobby have to hear you talking, especially if they can't understand
As a (white) immigrant to Russia, the difference in treatment I receive from the churkas is pretty guilt-inducing
I've been bitched about a few times, but I'm sure it's much worse if you've a dark complexion
Man don’t throw the ч-word around that casually
Really
Russians seem to throw it around willy-nilly
You're free to remind them it's a trashy thing to do
Fair, it's a bit hard to get a gauge on things since A. Judging the weight of foreign profanity is pretty difficult and B. Russians don't really seem to buy into the concept of racism (as it is back home at least)
But I'll refrain from using the word
Russians are blunt in general, there’s no political correctness culture here
Russia is home to like 100+ ethnic groups
The concept of racism here, in my opinion, gets more along the lines of ethnic nationalism and religious prejudice rather than racial superiority theories
A fair bit is also playful banter
A fair bit is malicious and fueled by true and perceived historical grievances
I think as a Brit you can relate
You guys went around putting your flag on things, we did the same and never lost most of the “colonies” as they are firmly attached to the core Russian landmass
In the recent years due to erosion of economic stability (however fleeting it was, the period of 2000-2014 was a period of growth and newfound optimism as opposed to current stagnation and degradation of social contract between the “elite” and the people) and the increase of migration from neighboring Central Asian counties (Russia is like number 3 after USA and Germany in number of immigrants received) gives rise to social tensions
*In the recent years
* 2000-2014 was definitely not a better time for ethnic tensions
In fact around the years 2014-2017 we were at some of the lowest levels of xenophobia in decades according to polls
>Выросла (с 10 до 19%) и доля граждан, одобряющих идею «Россия для русских», которая снижалась с 2014
39% опрошенных лояльно относятся к дискриминационным объявлениям о сдаче жилья или о работе (больше всего таких ответов в Москве – 63%)
Кроме того, с 58 до 67% выросла доля респондентов, считающих, что правительство должно ограничивать приток мигрантов.
>Разные объекты неприятия актуализируются в общественном мнении в зависимости от социально-политического контекста, поясняет Пипия: «Неприязнь к другим гражданам и шире – к государствам на фоне чемпионата мира по футболу демонстрировала позитивную динамику, чему косвенное свидетельство – заметное улучшение отношения к США и ЕС летом 2018 г. **Эта внешняя ксенофобия в 2014–2017 гг. вытеснила этническую ксенофобию, распространенную до 2014 г. Теперь же на место негативного отношения к Западу возвращается базовая ксенофобия к этническим меньшинствам**».
Basically we were more tolerant towards ethnic minorities when we felt more antagonism towards the West ironically enough
Sorry for phrasing, I meant 2000-2014 as better years for economy / perception of economy
I’ve never supplied statistics for ethnic tensions
I agree with your sources, I remember there was a lot of neo-nazis in late 1990ies - early 2000is, right now they’re virtually non-existent
There’s casual racism in the western sense though as far as colloquial expressions go and that was the primary topic of the original discussion that flourished from my original throwaway joke
It’s really hard to quantify “casual” stuff, such as private discussions using ethnic slurs
The way I see it, it’s pretty common and this sentiment is shared by the British dude I was talking to
Today I learned that the common card deck is called french and that there are others
Depends on season
In summer 15°C is pretty cold
In Winter -25°C. In Fall and Spring nobody really understands what is cold, what is fresh, what is hot so it's easy to meet someone wearing a down jacket, and next to someone wearing a T-shirt, and you find it difficult to say which of them was wrong with the choice of clothes
I'll wear a light jacket if it's below 18C. Or maybe a light cotton sweater
I'll switch to a medium jacket when it's below 10C or put on a sweater under my light jacket
I'll switch to my down jacket when it's below -10C or maybe when it's below -2C and I have to spend a lot of time outside doing nothing strenuous
When it's below -18C I'll start complaining about the weather
Same for me
Germany
London
Switzerland
Don’t ask me why, I can’t elaborate it properly
Maybe because Europe associates with these countries for me
Just fine
Personally, I just get sad or annoyed that it's dark so early, but nothing major
Also snow helps: it reflects light and thus keeps the ground from being completely black
I don't think your reaction to winter is normal, you should go to a professional if it interferes with your daily life
Although he doesn't compensate this probably with increased alcohol consumption
Yeah, I didn't realize how much of a difference it makes until this winter, we usually have at least *some* snow by the end of December
It isn't a popular phrase in Russian and, as such, it doesn't have a conventional meaning
Depending on the context, it could mean being brave or being "a real man".
Because it doesn't have a sea (that would be my reason)
You should buy a lot of real estate and you will get a passive income
Then you will be able to retire and relax in Switzerland
I don't need a private jet, I want to live by the sea
Yes, quite a few times
Situations when all choices are just really bad are pretty rare
I never miss any elections (or "elections"), and I can't say I've ever been ashamed of my own vote
I've also supported and continue to support politicians with money and the nomination procedure
That's quite true
To many Russians Putin was the person to restore the faith in the Country
He represents what Russia always wanted to be: strong, healthy and independent
Russia was never given the chance to join the UN but America was
While the Cold war officially ended it's quite estranging to Russians to know that your former biggest enemy is sitting with missiles as close to you border as they can
Putin has this strong, unapologetic image which Russia needed as they felt that any sign of kindness they showed the world wasn't reciprocated
While I don't agree with this I can understand the reasoning
Yes, Putin's support increases with age
However, he managed to piss off his core electorate quite a bit recently by increasing the pension age
Putin's votes have always been mostly legit
That's the power of an autocrat
It's changing though
Obviously yes
Russia doesn't have fair elections, but you can still operate and even sometimes win within the limitations of unfair ones
The government also needs at least an illusion of democracy to maintain legitimacy, so they can't just abolish all democratic procedures completely
We are not in North Korea
> Russia was never given the chance to join the UN
Do you mean something else
USSR was a founding member of the UN and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and Russia inherited said position, which makes Russia one of the most influential UN members
I'm sorry I meant the Nato
My mistake
Yes, the same type of no-alternative elections we had during the Soviet times
When there was only one candidate on the ballot, and if you wanted to vote "no", you had to physically go into a cabin and cross away the name, thus making it public that you're voting "no" which endangered your wellbing
Thankfully, we have secret ballots nowadays
Voting for anyone is safe
It’s pretty common
I think it’s perceived as a bad habit
Started because i wanted to show off when i was young, now can’t get rid of this shit
My mother quit at the age of 47 and hasn't looked back for 2 years already
That wasn't easy for her, and she had tried quitting before that, but every new attempt would have been easier for her and lasted longer
She says an online community of aspiring quitters helped her a great deal, and she still posts there sometimes to inspire other people
25$ for a cigarettes pack !!!
I understand that it’s not so common in Australia since cigarettes cost 25$ lol
Also very popular in Russia
I really find it weird and not everyone likes it
Idk, [our Wikipedia] says 27
3% (but another part of that article says it's 39
1%?) of population smoked in 2019, and it's believable
It's much higher among men, yes, but it's going down
I paid something like 25-27 $ for a brand in Sydney in 2018, as far as I remember
That US played a major role in defeating Third Reich or "won" the Second World War
Yeah, unfortunately I even had to lecture my mum on that Romanians have latin/roman origin and not gypsy
I agree, these kinds of debates rarely make any sense anyway
Unlimited POWER
Definitely less than 10% here
That would be asking for harassment in Russia
I guess they mostly do so on nude beaches or somewhere where they aren't exposed to the public, like their own backyard in a summer house or some secluded lake where no one goes
Maybe 5% on Russian "wild" beaches in the south where you must forge your own way to though a rocky path
Most of the people sadly prefer to stay on crowded beaches - and there will be 95% of those
According to statistics 84
6% of people tend to believe to non-integral numbers
It can be from 1/3 of an average month pay to 3 times more expensive
So, having a Lego is kinda luxury
Lego's price like skyrocketed past 10 year
I remember we go after school to Lego shop and maybe bye something in was about 2-5$ in today's exchange
Now it's fucking from 15$ up up to heavens
Do you know the real reason to this
It is
I personally own zero lego products
When a child, my husband had about 4 big set and he was considered the richest guy around
Exactly
That’s a good way to sum it up
If something’s on google it’s not private
>Early Modern English:
Old-fashioned
I don't get all the words, but it does look and sound like English
>Middle English:
Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, and then I don't really get anything, but it still looks like English more or less
> Old English:
I won't even try to read this
>And for fun we'll throw in the sister language for English, Scots:
Feels like Ukrainian tbh: sometimes you can understand everything, but then it goes god knows where and you understand nothing
Middle English is quite understandable if you read phonetically
Early Modern is even little harder
Old English — cannot understand a single word
More like Serbian or Polish
I can get some words in Serbian and Polish, but it's very hard to understand general meaning
Wow, there is **the** meme
"Letz mi spik from mai hart" By Vitaly Mutko, Russian minister of Sport back then
You must listen to this perfect joy: [
Though the English is good because he was reading it, pronunciation is the key to the video
Clearly he was reading transcriptions written down in Cyrillic's.
Later on Putin, who is well known for creative birthday gifting, gifted him English phrasebook/self-help guide: [
That's... you know, he really did the best he could
When I was in Helsinki, I met an old lady in a grocery store in Itakeskus
She tried to talk to me, but once she realized that I don’t understand a thing in Finnish she switched to English with damn ease
I was impressed and we had a good experience talking to each other
This parliament is so fun
Very distinct from other countries
>This was her speech defending the candidature for the Olympic games in 2013
That's like a tradition
Yours is third of a kind connected to Olympics, in this thread
It's not even an accent
I think that he just reads cyrillcs transcription not even understanding what is he sayn, so it just pure Russian sound without even a hint on "pronunciation" thingy
Yes, the full title was "Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of Russian Federation", that title is shown on 0:09 He also was Russia bid manager to 2018 worldcup
Do you have like a specific timeframe as this could take a while
Too many to name tbh, but I'd say collectivization and the Holodomor
Russification policies that were widespread during Tsarist rule
Ivan the Terrible, the leader responsible for the beautiful palace in Moscow
But when it was finished he tore out the eyes of the architects who built it so "they could never build something so beautiful again" nice guy :)
There's also the time that Alexander the Great destroyed the city of Thebes and sold all of it's inhabitants into slavery to be able to fund his army
Anakin Skywalkerowicz
Although verb conjugation in Russian might be considered a war crime, I think there are things more horrible than making people speak and behave as Russians
I'd say the Swedish Potop of Poland in the 17th century can be up there too
I mean
Karl XII of Sweden was competent too and he failed miserably in the end
I don't have an opinion on whether Macedonia is part of Greece because it's like asking whether Kaliningrad is German or not: Both sides have decent arguments on different grounds
Historical claims vs right of conquest
But Alexander spoke Greek; worshipped Greek Gods; took on the cause of freeing Greek cities from Persian rule; was educated by one of the most famous Greek philosophers in history; his family competed in the Olympics etc
The man himself was a Greek
There is no possibility of his being anything else
Well, you see, people used to have a holiday on 7th of November (Revolution Day) and would be pissed to get it cancelled, but it was kinda awkward to continue to celebrate 7th of November after 1991
So bureaucrats searched through our very long and eventful history and found 4th of November when Moscow was liberated from Poles in 17th century, slapped "Day of National Unity" label on it and called it a day, heh
It's basically a placeholder of that holiday which was lost on Revolution Day, people mostly don't even remember what this new holiday is supposed to be
There's literally only six countries on this planet that British soldiers haven't visited at some point
Look it up
We have a long memory, and a lot of our abuses of our neighbors are justified by the nationalists as self-defense
Not quite, it was more a church holiday, Day of icon of Our Lady of Kazan, on which also liberation of Moscow was remembered and celebrated
Btw, for Romanovs it was somewhat family-related holiday since the dynasty was chosen to rule as a result of Time of Troubles
There was also an episode when Poles were going to kill young Romanov (and make son of Polish king rule Russia) and peasant Ivan Susanin sacrificed himself to prevent it - he pretended to lead them to Mikhail Romanov but instead led them into a deep forest and they all were not seen again
Susanin was a national hero in Empire's times
But modern people don't think about it all, it's just one random day you can not to go to work
[The Amritsar Massacre]
A British colonel shoots up a demonstration in India killing more than a thousand people and injuring one thousand five hundred more
I understand that there are incidents in which we killed more people, but this one sticks with me more for the mental image
[Here it is in the film Gandhi
It isn’t same
Jumahat, jumasol
Ivan Kupala and Maslenitsa, both are very old, pre-christian holidays that is pagan
A Dutchperson that can't ride a bicycle, a Finn that hates sauna, an Italian that doesn't drink coffee
Who from your country can join them
A Russian who doesn't go through a pack of cigarettes every day
Which type of coffee is most used in Finland
Do Finns prefer cappucchino, americano, french-pressed or smth else
Oh, come on
We are no match for the Balkans in this regard
We're still the number 10 of the most smoking countries as of 2016
I was surprised to know, though
These rules might be necessary to know even if you don't ride a bike
There's a stereotype that you have a bike over pedestrian priority over there
The sun is солнце, neutral
The moon is месяц, masculine or луна, feminine
In Russian, the moon (luna) is feminine, the sun (solntse) is neutral gender
Nope
We call other moons satelite or moon (спутник/луна), but месяц is a word for a month and archaic name of the Moon, currently may be used to emphasize there is not full moon in the sky: полумесяц (crescent)
It's used for phases of the moon, it's a direct equivalent to the English "crescent moon". Planetary moons are usually just called "луны" in casual speech but in scientific style the more defined "спутники" (natural satellites) is used
No, only for our moon
However, луна can be used for any moon
Everyone can name more Italian Renaissance artists, than American presidents
Outside of the US, that is
I love visiting less-touristy areas for these reasons
Also one of the best reasons to travel is to meet people as well
In less touristy areas you will probably meet more authentic locals
What funny cases can you tell that was in your city
For example, in my city, we have the [round monument] Once there was a storm and this monument rolled through the city and [workers tried to catch it with bulldozers]
They want to spend time with their spouses working in retail, very logical
He took a PS4 from electronics aisle, went to fruit section, weighted the box and slapped the barcode for a fruit of that weight
Went to self-checkout and pinged the PS4 as about 10$ worth of fruit, nobody stopped him
I would say it is German but anybody who I met in Germany was fluent in English
So I would say Russian because in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus(144
5 + 42 + 9
5 = 196M people) nobody speaks English, only native language and Russian
Also, in Eastern Europe, if somebody doesn't speak English you have a good chance that he speaks Russian(possible it is the older generation)
Russian of course wouldn't be a good choice as the only foreign language for you but it is a good choice as the second foreign language after English
That Ukraine, Italy and France are considered large in Europe
Sorry if this sounds too Russia-centric but I was really surprised when I learned that
>having a plate drying rack in a cabinet above the kitchen sink is not universal, and I learnt this from a Finnish user, who stated in a comment that it's a thing in Finland and Italy
Also in Russia and i assume in Belarus and Ukraine
If we exclude Denmark with its Greenland, the largest European country is France, which is the 42nd country in the world by land area
So there are plenty of countries that are bigger than the European ones
Lol, when someone not from Russia asks where I'm from, I say that it's a medium-sized city near Moscow (150km)
Lmao
Though it's comparable to London, Paris and Istanbul
I'm obviously talking about land area
And Ukraine isn't considered large by most of the metrics you've mentioned
Or by claiming your rightful living space
I'm not sure it means the same thing for everyone, but for me it's 200 000 – 1 000 000
My town is about 350 000, so it's kinda smallish and definitely feels very provincial
50000 would be a very small town where everyone gets around on foot and knows each other
I mean the entire urban area, not just the city proper
It makes more sense to compare those
Good idea, that way you can claim land corridor to it next and grab Poland
And then
you know the drill
This is true, these are the only genuinely big cities in Russia
Hard to say, almost every historically important person has supporters now
Maybe Gorbachev is the closest one to the nomination
A difficult question
Nowadays it's probably Putin
No one immediately comes to mind except Andrey Vlasov
Siding with a regime that considers you, and the rest of your ethnicity subhumans to be exterminated - until it becomes obvious you're gonna lose - does that to you, I guess
I'll have to think about it
Politicians aren't universally hated
Stalin's seen as a great statesman by many; Nicholas II is seen as a well-intentioned man who just wasn't right for the job; Gorbachev is seen as a weakling etc -- but none of them are "*hated*."
u/marabou71 raised a good point
Andrey Chikatilo (Russia's most notorious serial killer-cum-necrophiliac) is probably a better answer
>Ceausescu
Honestly, I know how to pronounce that only because I know his name in Russian
Ironically enough, wasn't spreading the Pope's brand of Catholicism one of the reasons William the Conquerer's invasion of England was deemed legal
There’s “betraying your country to stay alive” shitty, and then there’s “putting your country up on Craigslist” shitty
More or less than the Targowica Confederation
I wonder if average Pole even remebers him
While he was Pole and began political career  in Wilno, there was little interaction between him and Poland during his prime years
Yeltsin
People tend to think that he is the reason why the Soviet Union lost the Cold War
That's pretty good
If even a tenth of the stuff he was accused of is true (like the abducting of girls and all), then he'd be hated massively
But yeah, the average Russian wouldn't know him I don't think
He's not really hated though
He's the sort of person you just roll your eyes and sign at
Who, Geralt
Probably used silver sword
Very accurate
Both Beria and Ezhov are kinda known but kinda forgotten at the same time
Depends on erudition of a person
But those who know associate them with bad things only
There is still a bad ring to "Beria" name, compared to that of "SS" one
I mean, it even sounds scary and evil
Taking a leap from state figures, Chikatilo probably would be nominated for most disgusting person award by most people
Shame, that cunt should be hated
Has done irreversible damage to us
The fall of the USSR was tragic
People don’t hate him for losing the cold war, they hate him for the repercussions
The hunger, unemployment, chaos
Nobody wants fascism in this country
We still have WWII heroes walking our streets and Russians remember the horrors of Nazi Germany
I think he's one of the reasons the USSR not just fell, but shattered into pieces
I thought he only started it
Tbh it’s kind weird
Catherine the Great is considered one of the greatest rulers of the Russian Empire, among Peter I.
She did have some very wild sex tho
Also a good contender
Yeah, I think I'm gonna edit my answer to include Chikatilo
Maybe his hatred is so great that it alone puts Kaczynski on top
I think historians could argue on the motives here,  in the end history cannot be written objectively
And you’re absolutely right
The neo-fascist ideology is rising even in countries that suffered from it in the past like Germany and Italy
This
Historical moment - for the first time a German and a Russian agree

Ok, ok
First time agree about some positive thing
Nah

Ok come here I have plenty of them
Thanks America for the land-lease, of course we could have taken Berlin without any technical support but only God knows how much more Russian blood would have been spilled
Also thanks Finland and Austria for maintaining their neutrality
This is more important to us than you think
>Thank you to all countries who stood up to Germany and Russia over the last 1000 years
Russia was created less than 600 years ago, Germany -- 200 years ago
Hm, I've always thought that Alexander II is the most popular Russian monarch in Finland, not Alexander I...
>his russification campaign
It was his father, Alexander III, who started it, so I bet that AIII wasn't popular, either
Okay
Thank you very much for the information
It was very interesting to learn how the rulers were seen and are rememberes in regions of the Empire, apart from the "core" Russian provinces
I'm rooting for you guys
When I was in Georgia last time I was pleasantly surprised that most young people I met spoke little to no Russian, but instead they all spoke perfect English, so that's how we communicated
It all starts with the youth who are raised to cherish their native language and culture, with the help of the government, of course
I meant that priorities are changing, especially with the youth
I'm not saying that it's bad to learn and speak Russian or any other language
But, somehow (I might be wrong) I feel like the compulsory learning of Russian at schools is a thing of the past and abandoning this practice is a step forward for some of the ex-Soviet republics in building a strong national identity
But, of course, what works for some countries like Georgia or Estonia, might not necessarily work for, perhaps, more linguistically diverse countries like Belarus or Ukraine
These are just some personal thoughts, coming from a linguist who roots for linguistic diversity in the world))
Look, I was just trying to point out that compulsory learning of Russian seems to be the reason why some national and regional languages receive less attention, especially among the youth, which doesn't make it easier for the promotion of a language
Secondly, I never said that Georgia and Estonia have NO linguistic diversity
Obviously, Georgia has other languages apart from Georgian
But it is more monolingual than, say, Ukraine, because 87% of population there speaks Georgian, compare that to 67% of Ukrainian speaking population
At the same time, I agree that adding Estonia to the list is a bit of a stretch
Every day
It’s really too much and sometimes it’s annoying because I want to know more news about my country
I want to see the protests in Russia on TV more than in the USA(They show it to us every day)
We have a lot of misinformation about the United States on television
Seems like there are already too many comments there
But I will add: rarely lol
I only hear of USA in context of major events, it surely will be on news during American elections, or during important international meeting
But the USA don't appear as often here
Most of my news are about Belarus right now
But why everyone goes there to do a stag party
I know 1-2 persons who did it already
LMAO, please tell me that’s it’s a reference to Skripal case
Yeah exactly
It's not an authentic Medieval castle, but it's still really cool
And of course paints a picture of what people in the 19th century romanticized the Medieval times as
Excellent ahahaha
Originally Poland, then Turkey (starting from the 18th century), then the UK (19th century) and starting from the 20th century the USA
But it's all politics
I personally like all those countries
Well, I wouldn't say so, really
It is tantamount to saying that the rival of the US Vietnam or Iraq instead of China
Rivals are countries that are kind of equally powerful
Ukraine isn't a rival
It is part of the motherland

You called
Good times
Well, economy is not the only factor that defines Great powers
Actually, the concept of great powers is very relative
Many consider Britain, France, India, Japan great powers
Even Brazil sometimes
I don't quite agree with you
Well, China is not a superpower, either
I didn't say that Russia has faster GDP growth than China
This is a windmill
I agree that China is much stronger than Russia
But at the same time I say that Russia is definitely not a secondary power
I think that disagreeing with it is simply strange
Well, here everything just relies on your definition
I, for example, see Russia as a great power and countries like Poland or Italy as regional powers
It is all abstract constructions that are not connected to reality anyways
I didn't say that the US is currently a rival of Russia
I said that it was in the 20th century
Today the greatest rival of Russia is Russia
I didn't try to change my version
Maybe I indeed didn't express myself clearly and I admit that
But I won't tolerate slander from your behalf
I started arguing with your statement saying that Russia is not the great power
Then we discussed China and finally concluded that views on statuses of great powers, regional powers and superpowers are relative
I truly didn't comment that thing about 70s because I got distracted by the other argument in that comment
What you are doing now is pedantic nitpicking
Why are you so aggressive, anyways
It feels like you were wasting people's time, fighting your imagination
What makes you think that the question is about today
Is it mentioned that the rival must contemporary
Why do you assume that a rival is something contemporary at all
There are a lot of answers under this post that are about history
Why don't you tell them all that they are vasting someone's time
P.S. your imagination
Giving stats comparing china and russia (nobody asked you about it) and complaining that I dare to change my own words in order to take your laurel from your great reddit debate victory over my statements that you had misinterpreted

No thanks
You are saying this as if you visit  giant malls built by slaves every day
Where else can you find such mixure of modernity and  antiquity
I was in Munich 10 years ago around Christmas time and I remember than the men putting up the Christmas tree were wearing Wehrmacht helmets painted yellow-green
CZ/RU:
čerstvý/cherstvyj - fresh/stale
vůně/vonj - smell/stench
záchod/zakhod (solntsa) - toilet/sunset
pozor/pozor - attention/shame
Чёрствый (Ćorstvyj) is mostly used to describe stale, hardened bread or baked goods
Rotten would be гнилой (gniloj)
Its not so bad here
The climate is frustrating sometimes
My country is all over the place
That's cool, i guess, and with nukes we don't even have to bother about invasions from all sides
It would be great to have access to Mediterranean, to its trade, culture and climate, but i guess Black sea will suffice
Surely Portugal's the most ideally placed country in Europe for exploration
It has/had straight routes both down to Africa and the Cape of Good Hope and westward to Brazil and the Americas
A coloniser/trading nation couldn't ask for a better location
As for Britain, it's a similar story; perfectly situated for maritime escapades
Once the Isles were unified and England no longer shared any land borders with other powers, the protection afforded by the English Channel and the North Sea meant that Britain never had to spend as great a proportion of its wealth on its armies as continental Europeans were forced to
That meant more money was available for the navy and, ultimately, the British could outspend any naval rival until the 20th century
Perhaps the next most happy coincidence was the plentiful reserves of easily accessible coal, which allowed the UK to independently fuel its industrial revolution
You could argue that these two geographical facts made it pretty much a certainty that Britain would be a great power until oil supplanted coal as the primary fuel of ships
>We have great neighbours, allowing us to borrow (quite) a bit of their culture, mainly gastronomical
Orrite mate, you won' try these 'ere fish 'n' chips
I really like Romania, so I hope our government doesn't try to pull any nonsense down there
You guys have a very good relationship with Serbia though, and I don't think Russia would want to fight with Serbia's other BFF
Yeah, humour aside, the Irish should be at the top of our apology list
You can realise Ekaterina's dream to "liberate" Constantinople
But it's all they talk about in heaven, no
But then you look on the other side of the couch past Bulgaria and suddenly neither place seems so good lol
I also think the History of England has to be viewed as two separate narratives/experiences in which the ruling class is separate from the commoners
How the Plantaganets saw themselves was obviously different from the Old English peasantry and I'd argue that the monarchy wasn't really properly divorced from Europe until Queen Victoria and the loss of Hanover
Until that point there was always *some* interest tying monarchs to the continent (claims on France, outposts like Calais, aspirations to meddle, foreign offices, etc
>we haven't been successfully invaded
[Oj rili
I'll admit I'm being a tad facetious
It's interesting how it seems that, with the Stuarts, England managed to *twice* make a foreign ruler place the interests of his new throne ahead of that of his other country
Still, though, William did land a fleet and an army on English soil
Well there was a bit of a scuffle in Reading and the Irish obviously had words to say later ;)
Life is too short to spend your whole life in one country without seeing how other people live
Напоминает анекдот про неуловимого джо
Yeah traveling it’s probably the only thing where you spend money but become richer
Отложить личину [otlojit' lechinu]- literal translation would be "to deposit a maggot". Trust me, it sounds better in Russian
We joke that Caucasians love tuned Ladas
"The higher the mountains, the lower the Prioras
" The stereotypical car there is a white Lada Priora (because it's the cheapest color) with 100% tint on every window and suspension tuned so low you can hear every grain of sand grind on its belly
It makes sense
"Lada" is derived from *lad'ya* (a type of Slavic boat; Lada uses it as a brand label), so the Polish for boat, łódź, is etymologically related to it
But they still have the highest market share
No, Bronto is a special edition
They sold the name Niva to Chevrolet and renamed the original car 4x4
Now Chevy has pulled out of the Russian market and AutoVAZ owns the name again
When I lived in the UK with my girlfriend I went to dinner with her parents for her birthday, and I didn't make a very good impression
I've always been used to doing things a certain way in Russia
So when I came through the door, I waited for them to invite me further in so I just stood there like an idiot for a couple of minutes before thinking better of it
Then I took my shoes off (which none of them did) and ended up having to put them back on
That dinner was a disaster
They apparently found me very hard to talk to; I offended the mother by suggesting something for one of her dishes; they found my habits strange etc
I expected it to be an answer about the other kind of trash
Most cars in Moscow/SPB will stop, because cameras are everywhere and they don't fancy going to jail and/or losing their license over hitting some moron
Russian law: if a pedestrian is crossing in an improper spot, they are in the wrong
If you hit them, you are in the wrong
Is it some very European joke or what
Why you can't have a dinner at 19 or 21:30
Why
It was partially my fault as well
I should have asked what to do before I turned up
Luckily enough I got rather close with her parents in time
People do it all the time with me :(
Not like that
Because it makes no sense
The damn day has 24 hours, not 12
I was traveling with a group of east Asian people
My stomach was upset and I wanted something bland and quick to eat, so I kept asking to stop for bread
They were very confused and eventually started laughing
I couldn't understand what was so funny about wanting to have a piece of bread, until someone explained that white bread is not seen as an "upset stomach" type of food in Asia
Rather, it's viewed as a dessert
Yes, this measure could be different for different parts of Russia too
Once I've been to Yaroslavl and had trouble with roaming and the manager in a store said that it is easier for me to go to Kostroma and buy sim-cart there
It was some kind of confusion for me because I’m used to taking a trip to a neighboring city as a serious business that takes a whole day to get there and a day back
And then she said \`You will back in the evening\`.
Oh, these small West-Russia distances
It's hard for me to even imagine how people live in western Europe, where distances are even less
I live in Siberia
Each place that you can reach during daylight hours is near
Yeah breads tend to be sweeter and much softer
Many European people who come to Japan/Korea are often very disappointed by the quality of bread compared to their home countries
&#x200B;
For scale:
Why swing the dial all the way to commieblocks
Rowhouses are a nice medium density alternative
Yes
we also perceive all the distances that you can cover in the daytime as close
The thing that I noticed, is that people really feel that they are so [insert nation] only when they leave their home country and start living abroad
The grass seems always greener on the other side ...
I always felt Russian (even if I have some Armenian background)
I love our country, our history (yeah, not all parts of our history) and our mentality
Since i am a reserved person, maybe “shy”, I just noticed that I can’t fit well in countries like Spain, France, Italy
since people there are much more talkative, love partying 24/7, loud etc
So i guess i will never feel better than home, just because of the Russian mentality, even if we have a fucking long way to go to meet European quality life standards
Sry for my english

T’as pas vu le film Budapest avec Manu Payet toi par hasard
I've never seen anything like that, lmao
You can see a random graffiti here and there (almost never related to religion, though), but I guess that doesn't really count
Ukrainian and Belorussian
I cannot choose between them  because they both are easy for a Russian to read (and listen, too, actually)
Probably Belorussian is a bit easier, though I haven't heard or seen it as often as Ukrainian because in Belarus most people use Russian, anyway
I also understand it much easier than Czech when spoken for some reason
For be Belarusian is definitely much easier to follow
The same for me about polish

Hi all
In Russia we have Teremok  They cook Bliny (thin pancakes) with different stuflings
We have pirožki, which are hand pies with various fillings:
- cabbage
- apple
- sour cherry
- minced meat
- egg and onion
- mashed potato
- rice and egg
Probably shaurma
( Not really russian, but extremely popular here)
Irony
The main inscription on the website says "Teremok isn't fastfood"
Not really
Its certainly not national
But we all know, that isn't true
But I like it
Sometimes I'm glad to order a glass of kvass :)
By the way, how can I get the Russian flag into my nickname here
>Home Page of the sub
>3 dots in the right corner
>change user flair
Спасибо :)
Но проблем)
I guess that it is considered strange
It is extremely uncommon
Not really, they're sold at most events hosted by local governments
I've only really seen it on government buildings
Very possible
However, I don't think that there are a lot of flag nerds
Well, yeah, it goes without saying
But people don't display them on their houses or something
Well, of course people who are very patriotic buy and wear clothes with the Russian flag on it, but when I wrote my comment I was thinking rather about having flags on walls of houses, outside or inside
Or, you know, like in American suburbs where they place flagpoles with American flags near the house door
We don't usually do that here
Fans of the USSR certainly do
Some of them say that it is a "real" Russian flag and all
Some go even further and bring up the [black-yellow-white flag] of the Empire and say that it is a real flag (though it was used only for 38 years and the rest of the time the Empire, which existed for 300 years used the modern-day white-sea-red one)
So yeah, people still don't know which flag they want
Hm, having taken a second thought, I change my mind, hahah
I think that it is excessive to connect nationalism and flag worshiping
The name speaks for itself
[Banner over the Reichstag]
Oh yeah
I couldn’t think of a famous photo from Russia’s until I saw this
The first 9 pics are quite famous, but why Nixon
Dog's poos
The vast majority of dog owners don't clean after their pets
And since population density is really high in Moscow, people love doggies and there are zero restrictions, it leads to the ground covered in faeces
810 roubles (about 9 euros) per month and I receive unlimited Internet for two mobile devices (with free hotspot availability — this is considered a separate service, but is included in this particular tariff), 1300 minutes per month and 300 SMS per month to share between them and a few other temporary perks
Yeah, some things related to computers and phones are really cheaper in Russia, but quality is often sacrificed for price
And still your life expectancy is pretty good, I wonder if it’s due to ecology and food quality
Wow, that is super bad even for poor regions in Russia
5 years
That is insane
Is it due to overload of your medical system or is mental health not taken seriously
Sorry to hear that, mental health should definitely be a priority anywhere in the world
Hope you feel better soon
The only one i can think of that is still in use is sotka (from the word sotnyj - 100th), it's used when measuring land and is equal to 100 m^(2) (it's pretty much just a different name for are)
Traditional units of measurement were replaced by metric ones after the revolution, but you can stumble upon them in our classical literature
Some of them: versta = 1
067 km, pud = 16
38 kg, arshin = 71 cm, vershok = 4
5 cm
I used to hate the food that Russians always eat on major celebrations like New Year's Eve and others, but now I tremendously enjoy it
Behold:
* [dressed herring]
* [aspic]
* [beetroot salad] edit: it's almost always coated in mayonnaise or sour cream, but google images seem to be unaware of it for some reason
* [pickled cucumbers]
* [pork fat]
There’s something so special about Ukrainian folk music that just sets it apart from anything else
One of the only genres that you genuinely want to sing along to
Aspic tastes much better than it appears
But you'll never know that until you become brave enough to try it
That looks very similar to what we serve here since it's usually dressed with mayonnaise or sour cream
For some reason, google pics that I linked tend to show the version without sauce
Not only does it look gross, but its Russian name doesn't sound appetising at all
Both "холодец" and the even worse "студень" suggest that it's something slimy and nauseous (just from the sound, not from the actual underlying meanings of these words)
I guess it contains some nutrients that are good for your joints
At least my grandmother always says that
Probably it is, but English isn't my native language, so I may not always say things like a native speaker would
The direct translation from Russian would be "salted cucumbers", "marinated cucumbers" or "preserved cucumbers". I guess pickles is ambiguous since other vegetables like tomatoes can be pickled too
Russian Google says it's because originally it was made with a vinegar sauce that was called vinaigrette in French
And French was a popular language at that time
I did, thanks for recommending it to me
It’s stunning
Folk is is a genre that seems transport you to another place
Whatever mood I was in before playing it is completely transformed by the stunning vocals of Eastern European folk music
You'll appreciate it if you focus on the flavours, not the looks
The best way to try it is by taking part in a blind contest where you don't see what you're given
The taste is really good (although it's subjective)
I think what’s so great about folk is that it shows us a country’s soul and culture before mass cultural exchanges
As you said, the music feels pure, raw, primal
It was honest
It’s honest now, but personally, that level of intimacy is gone
I've never seen fish-based aspic tbh
I guess it's mostly with pork or sometimes chicken or beef, but hypothetically could be anything
Nordsee, since we don't have good seafood casual dining
McDonalds shrimps aren't bad, but aren't enough
Not really
In Russia we don't actually use even "e-mail" in casual conversation
We usually decrypt that abbreviation and say "electronic mail".
As for "g-mail'', in Russia the situation on a market is quite different
Here Google has two local competitors, Yandex and Mail
ru companies which somehow manage to stand against Google
They both have their own mails
Many people use theirs instead of Google's. Most use all three
Mail
ru is considered as something that boomers use, though
Sometimes
But Russia has a couple of alternative mail services that people use so we don't say gmail that much
Even I, who uses gmail, say e-mail still
In russia we say either electronic post (elektronnaja počta) or colloquially we call it soap (mylo) because it sounds a bit like “mail”
No, we haven't. We usually just say "mail" (почта), in more official speech it's usually specified that you talk about electronic mail (электронная почта)
Also, I'm not even sure if Google is the most popular email provider here, we also have Yandex and Mail
ru which seem to be as, if not more, popular
Boomers use rambler
I am too much of a zoomer to recall rambler, tbh
Poland, Lithuanua, Germany
I wanted to write Sweden and the Ottomans, but we don't learn much about their internal policies and foreign ambitions beyond wars with Russia
Make it 58
Only after you become a senior citizen you earn the priviledge to spend your retirement money on dem pistol banana skins
Gotta start early to spend all those euros
It's 65 for men, 60 for women here actually
It’s 65 for men these days
but if they do, they can gamble too
I don't know, maybe because it's considered that it's harder for them to work, maybe it's for them to stay home with grandkids, maybe something else
I read that when senior citizenship started in Europe, they used to get it earlier, because their lifespan was shorter, but now I don't know why
It will be Communism with the Global Ai and Atomic Robots
Don't be afraid, mate, you will not be alone :3
We have lots
For example:
Despite all the difficulties, Ukraine remains the fraternal country
I think every third Russian has relatives in Ukraine
Belarus
It used to be Ukraine, too, but after the unfortunate events in the recent past the countries are not longer friendly to each other
Ukraine
I guess
Yes, governments definitely aren't friendly to each other, but people still get along fine
But you can't deny that our countries grew from one tree - Old Rus
We're Eastern Slavs
I don't speak about politics but about people
There are a lot of Russians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia
Almost  in every region of Russia the second nation is Ukrainians
We have common history
Russians love Ukrainian literature, especially, Shevchenko
Please, don't make an artificial border between two nations
We should be friends not enemies
Да и клал я вообще на политику. Как будто прям все россияне поддерживают нынешнюю власть.
Love you too
Yes, you're right
But, actually, the relatives of majority of Russians are in Ukraine
Yes, I forgot about Belarus
Honestly, there are very minor differences between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus
My friend who came to Russia from Ukraine told me that he didn't see any differences at all ( except language, ofc)
I am generally satisfied with the current version of my country's flag (certainly better than the USSR's one)
Maybe I'd add Russian double-headed eagle on it, though
It is one of the symbols of the country and bears a good share of its historical legacy
Besides, almost any national facility has it as a part of its emblem, so why don't we put it onto the flag
That's optional, though
Like I said, I am generally satisfied with the current flag
Would probably add our emblem to our flag somehow : [link] and also make the blue color darker
My favourite one is [this]
Your flag is one of the best, imo
It would actually make more sense
Good idea

but you're also expected to help your parents when they're old (we call it "to pass them a glass of water"), and sending your parents to a retirement home is a social taboo here
So basically your parents help you while you're young, and you help them when they're old
(Not OP) I've seen Americans on social media actually call it "rent" because that's what it is, but that may be different in Scotland/the UK
« Why are you always angry when you talk to your parents/friends »?
Nope, I am not angry, it’s just a normal conversation =\
It’s actually sounds very professional and intelligent, I find
The same is said about Russian
In my opinion, French, Italian and Spanish (aka the most beautiful and romantic languages in the world) sound a lot harsher than Russian or German
Never heard of "Psheki". We mostly say Polyaki
&#x200B;
Edit: if so, "Psheki" would be slightly derogatory
Polyaki - nyet
It was for danish or german
German for me sounds like russian speaking english with accent
No you say “allora” every sentence
Opera singing in German is magnificent and powerful
It’s probably linked to the general russian mindset -> don’t give a shit
danke !
Got you :)
French mainly for the nasals and the "r" sound (I know it's the same in German, but it's pronounced in a more relaxed manner in German), and Italian mainly for the intonation
I can understand for French, hardly for Spanish, but not really for italian
It’s soooooo soft
Lol, I am reading you and I am actually in Amsterdam airport waiting for my connection flight
Funny ;)
Spanish sounds a bit aggressive to me, even though it's not
Poland for such cities as Lvov and Grodno (even though they are not Russian, yet), Germany for beautiful Kaliningrad
Finland for Karelia where I was born
Sweden for Ingermanland where St
Petersburg was built
Thank you Serbia for being bros and not jumping on the Russophobia train
We also have to thank Iceland for the same
I doubt they are Russophobic
This small village doesn't care about politics at all, cool guys
Stalin, or should I say Soviet soldiers have freed most of the European continent
My grandad was fighting for Budapest and Prague
That's why it's so weird to see Polish people writing "thank you Germany for being a role model". Wow
Why would we ever save their asses
I understand that, I don’t like him either
But reading comments online, it does seem like there are certain users who hate not only the president, but the people themselves
Nazis forced almost every fifth Polish to death
Better dead than red
You supported Hitler and Holocaust :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
To be fairer a lot don’t
Wouldn’t phrase it with “agreeing”. Many Russian people simply don’t have a choice, both because Putin blocks opposition, and also because Russia still has some very derpy political parties that include Communist USSR offshoots and far right nutjobs
So Putin is seen by many as the lesser of the evils
For a good comparison, I would use Bolsonaro
Yes he is a huge twat, but I know that not all Brazilian people support him
And a lot who do, simply do so because the alternative isn’t much better
The alternative to Bolsonaro would likely be just as corrupt and greasy and slimey
In many countries sadly you can’t rise to the top of the political system without those traits
That's just fucked up
Polish hate Russians for occupying their eastern territories despite the fact they belong to Ukraine and Belarus
Supplying Cuba and other communists regimes was bad, but providing Iraq, Vietnam, Libiya with democracy is totaly ok
The USSR operation in Afghanistan (which was its neighbor btw) is an act of showing imperialistic force
Attack on Afghanistan by NATO is a prevention of world terrorism
But what outrage me the most is bombardment of Beograd
Wow
NATO are real peacemakers
Like what
Blow up the president/parliament only to create a power bubble to be filled by pretty much the same people
Vote in predetermined elections
It’s not that easy, you should know that
Well, just so you know, I AM working against the government
The situation here is much more hopeless than in Ukraine
Yeah, stopping would be very foolish
And good luck to you guys too
Hopefully you’ll get Crimea, Donbas, Donetsk back soon
Along with some huge financial reimbursements from us
When I was a kid we had a spring latch on our front door, and it was a constant source of problems, because you would often lock yourself out and when you left the apartment you would still use the key to engage the deadbolt for more security
On our current door we have a spring latch attached to the handle, so it just keeps the door closed, plus two deadbolts
One is engaged by a key from the outside and by a knob from the outside, so locking the door is easy
And yes, the door is kept locked at all times
Джон мейд хиз уэй ту э таверн сру зе дарк форест, онли ту файнд аут зят хи форгот зе мани
Джон мейд хиз вей ту ей таверн цру цу дарк форэст онлый ту файндь аут хи форгот цу моний
Russian doesn't have the 'th' or 'w' sounds so I replaced th with ц (tz) and w with в (v)
I just used ц
Зят?!
Там другая э, которую я лично слышу как я
I mean abortions are legal in Belarus, and it it's a much less religious country than Poland
edit: I don't mean to be spiteful to those Polish women who now will have to go to Germany etc
to get abortions since it's not their fault
I just wanted to make a comment about Poland becoming "more like Belarus".
In my humble opinion, Slovenia is quite uninteresting
No offence dear Slovenians
I may just not know much about your country
It's like Russia, that froze in 80s. Like time capsule
"Bald and bankrupt" did a lot of interesting traveling video's there, but he is really into USSR history/style
Cuz it is
Yeah, "good for you" is the first one that comes to mind
If you translate it to Russian word for word, it will have very sarcastic and rude connotation
Russia is extremely corrupt
Basically, our government only exists to steal money and most of their decisions are based on how much they can steal from it
Our Ex Prime minister had stolen over 1 billion dollars and officials ignore it
Ask any not-brainwashed Russian and he will tell you about that
Yes, but it's not wise to openly oppose Putin online or else you'll disappear
Seriously, it's a law
Pretty corrupt
Recently some wise technical men decided to fuck the humanities/economist degree way people have been trying to fight corruption and now use bots/software, and grey economy got pretty hard anal
There is definite high level corruption, every member of government has a house in London or Switzerland
That said, the cited number that Putin stole 200 billion dollars from Russia that liberals and foreigners always regurgitate is just as nonsensical
The biggest corruption I have felt is my uncle being a Colonel and helping me get out of army service
Don't forget our hopeless elections and paid media figures with their sweet oil money
> Yes, but it's not wise to openly oppose Putin online or else you'll disappear
I guess Echo Moscow, TV Rain, Navalniy and so on created an army of clones because they shit on Putin every day
Not even saying about thousands of Russians on forums
This is literally why I always refer to him as "the President" online
The guys who watch the media for people talking shit about him aren't that great at their jobs (even less so if you do it in English) but it never hurts to be careful
That's pretty much right
Also we have crazy Marxist-leninist people and other subgroups
Medvedev's just a puppet on a string who isn't smart enough to understand that
Unfortunately it's reality as well
It's illegal to spread "fake news" (anything bad about Putin), youtubers and social media figures have been arrested for such shit
You can be black listed by the government or fined/thrown in jail
It's also very hard to obtain a reliable vpn in Russia so if you violate this law online, you can be charged or institutionalized
Most media figures are paid by the government with the money they get from the sheer amount of natural resources in Russia
So most media is controlled by the state
If you're problematic to Putin's agenda and you're not thrown in the Gulag you can also be filtered from Russian media or get terminated
I don't know the details, but on the face value it's not corruption
Corruption is a government official creating illegal shortcuts for a private entity in exchange for money (or other goods) - or creating artificial barriers for those who don't bribe
What you're talking about is probably illegal, but that doesn't mean it's corruption
As, for example, tax evasion is not corruption, it's just a felony - unless a tax inspector helps you for a bribe
Lensky's aria from the opera "Eugene Onegin" by Tchaikovsky
Anna German makes (made
) some really good music
[Надежда] is another song I would add to that list
Moscow is a large city, 12 million people plus commuters
What I like:
- 24x7 availability of almost everything
- still lots of green spaces
- great public transport
- lots of places to eat out and cultural venues
What I don't like:
- it's still growing, and newer areas are marginally better than commieblock districts
- terrible car traffic
- no good medium density housing, your options are either
- commieblocks, or
- incredibly overpriced housing
- single-family homes in car-dependent suburbs
- pre-commieblock blocks with great ceiling height, but outdated floorplans and infrastructure
The terrible car traffic is our biggest problem, it would be perfect without it
It *was* perfect for a few weeks during the covid scare
Moscow without Muscovites and the guests of the capital was real nice
Yes we do, but the traffic is only sick when you are driving a car
To limit the choice, I'll start with the first tsar (Ivan IV) and ignore all previous rulers
Men: Ivan, Fyodor, Boris, Vasily, Mikhail, Alexey, Pyotr, Pavel, Alexander, Nikolai
Women: Irina, Ekaterina, Anna, Elizaveta
You can (arguably) include Sophia into women list
Probably
I didn't include it as she never ruled as Sophia
It's basically the local variation of the same name
We call the British queen Elizaveta, just like our Ekaterina and Pyotr are Catherine and Peter in English
The pronunciation is [somewhat different] obviously
Didn't Tsaritsa Elizabeth annex some parts of Finland
Ah, okay, fair enough
Dora teaches English here in Russia, too
Which is especially weird in the series where she's a tween and hangs out with her friends
They live in a *very* Latin American city, their skin tones span the tonal range from criollo to zambo and they talk to each other in Russian-accented English phrases
> Why should they learn spanish in the UK
Because they spend their summer holidays in Spain
Just like some other country does
>Chruschtschow
This looks terrifying
English spelling is Khrushchyov btw
How and why did you (germans) made 7 letters out of 1 of ours (щ)
Khrushchyov is more correct, like Semyon instead of Semen
It's a pretty common name here
I'll let younger redditors post modern earworms, but:
[Black Eyes] Oh my
I went to Sochi the year it was released, and it was playing from every
single
thing
that could play music
I swear every other song on the radio was Black Eyes
[Exhibit, aka Louboutins] More famous for its music video, like The Fox, but everyone watched it
[The Smoke of Menthol Cigarettes] Now we're going deep into the past
This was playing in every roadside cafe in the 90s. Get someone old enough and drunk enough, get then in a melancholic mood, give them a karaoke mic and you will get this
[Accountant] The first music video with a bookend plot "like in the the West". It's 29 years old, but expect any male accountant (a rare thing) to hate it with all their heart
Russia
Чёрный Бумер. It was everywhere in the 2000s.
It was a massive hit here too
A classic
No you’re not
I do too
Yes, it's one of female-dominated jobs
So all your colleagues are likely to be women, and whenever you have a birthday they are likely to come up with "let's sing 'Accountant' to him
It probably is, I just don't know modern music well enough
I have not seen any signs of panic yet
No panic buying because of a coronavirus but likely there will be panic buying because of RUB/USD exchange rates (ruble tumbled by 5% currently) after OPEC+ oil-deal failure
Yeah, i just see ppl in masks occasionally (and even that's in Moscow, not in my hometown)
Yes, there are people wearing masks, but shops are quite ok
Вселенная (vsellennaya) meaning “universe”. Every time I hear this word I’m filled with awe for some reason
Maybe it’s my brain trying to cope with the concept of infinite space
It's quite interesting word, because before 1918 "world" and "peace" were two similar yet different words: "мiръ" (world) and "миръ" (peace)
Both words are pronounced the same
"До свидания" literally means "until meet you" and is a quite formal way to say goodbye
But the word "свидание" alone in modern Russian means a romantic date
Technically it's two words
Sustainable words combination
Old slavic names like Radomir, Spiridon, Lukyan, Svyatozar and so on
Especially those names sound weird with common surnames
Just imagine Athelweard Wilson, Brunhild Taylor, etc
Zahar, Makar and Ivan
Is Michael a bad name
> Jack
It's a dog's name here too
There are so many comments about English sounding names
is it really *that* common
It seems that their popularity is on the rise
I never considered Spiridon archaic, thb
My guess is "Saint Light/Fire" (svyatoy + zar)
update: google says it means "enlightened with light".
I don't hate it but those names sound odd like naming your children with mythology names, names from centuries ago, fictional names, etc
And we also use patronymic so future kids will have it weird: Alexander Svyatopolkovich, etc
>Brunhild is Russian too
I used it as an example for English names
Pffffffahahaha
I also thought about it as "svyat
" (saint) instead of "svet".. (light for "enlightened")
Helicopter, periodic table, petrol cracking, i also wanna say Google
There are many things invented by Russians
I think that the greatest one is Periodic Table of elements by Mendeleev
Other important inventions:
- Radio is invented by Popov
- Theremin (the first electronic musical instrument) is invented by Leon Theremin
- AK-47 by Kalashnikov
- The Thermonuclear weapon by Sakharov and Ginzburg
- Laser by Basov and Prokhorov
- First satellite - sputnik
- Lunokhod - the first robotic lunar rover
- First nuclear power plant
- Helicopter by Sikorsky
- Non-Euclidean Geometry by Lobachevsky
- The incandescent light bulb by Lodygin
- Tetris
- Vodka
Isn't "robot" derived from a word that's connected with "work"?
The radio part is debatable, as you probably know
For those who don’t, look up Alexander Popov
Why Google though
I like to think that a Russian guy was the founder of such a huge company and everyone uses it everyday
> robota
> unpaid unfree work
As a Russian, I see no contradiction here /
Hm, in Russian it means just any type of work
Got it
However, Google (just as Yandex) took an idea and did a great job of developing it into a successful business rather than invented the technology in the first place
True
I know that it wasn’t appropriate to say Google, since it’s not a technology, but still
Yes
There is a word "Власовец" ("Vlasovets") which is formed from the surname of the collaborator general Vlasov
The official propaganda often labels people they don't like with this word
Also polizei (полицай) is still an insult
Also Banderovtsi
Technically speaking, they were Ukrainian and not Russian collaborators, but the term was used before and still used to this day
Although more towards Ukrainians rather than anyone else
Yes, I wanted to mention it, too, but I changed my mind because, as you have truthfully said, it is more used in a context of Ukrainians
I don't really think that they were Nazis, to be honest
They had a more of a nationalistic agenda
The situation during the war was very difficult from the moral point of view for most people, especially those who were patriotic towards the Russian Empire, because they had to choose between 2 evils: Stalin and Hitler
Frankly speaking, both sides didn't like Russia
Real Russia I mean
But still, they sided with Hitler and all
I don't approve that personally
I think that the best option if we have such a dilemma would be just to chill out and think about things that are more cheerful for our every day life ;)
If the Soviet Russia is counted, then Tetris is unrivaled, it's one of the most well-known videogames in the world
As for more recent games, then Heroes of Might and Magic 5, the King's Bounty sequels, World of Warships, War Thunder come to mind
I don't know which one is more well known
STALKER is great
Especially the voice acting
"Ну, подорвали, пацаны! Мля, я маслину поймал!" STALKER 2 when
God bless Czechia for Factorio and Space Engineers
Victoria 2
Also Vangers, which has the trippiest and the most original setting ever
Oh, I had no idea HOMM were from Russia
One of my favourite games so far, although I don't have a considerable experience
Yeah, Nival made very good effort at balancing between the classic mechanics from HoMM 3 and some novelties like the new skill tree
I still prefer HoMM 3 one, but 5 is certainly good
I tried playing the 6th one, and I didn't like it at all, it didn't play like HoMM
But it will be an online live service game
It is not necessarily a bad thing - the Zone and stalkers are pretty good material for an open world MMO sandbox
But it has very good chances to be one another forever early access bug infested survival games
Just the one that came 5 years later after the main craze for the genre
Yep, also Russian
Seems so
I haven't heard of this game
Is it famous
Wargaming is indeed a Belarusian company
However, World of Warships in particular is developed by [Lesta Studio] their subsidiary located in Saint Petersburg, Russia
As the development office and all key people in World of Warships are from Russia, I think it should be fair to attribute the game to Russia
Not the entire series, only HoMM 5
HoMM 1-4 are American, 6 is Hungarian, 7 is German
Are you subbed to Sir Troglodyte on YT
I'm not subscribed, but I know the channel
I don't know why on Earth I watched a couple of 30 minute videos about a game I no longer play, but his voice is just so soothing
Yeah, "Dark" is really solid tv-series
Top-notch production
Yet it still not beat Kommissar Rex as my favorite german-themed series)))
I want to thank Finland for all the nice things we have just over the border
>but we don't you as people
Don't view
Don't respect
Don't like
At least some Finns go to Russia too, especially in Vyborg and St
Petersburg
Russia (and other Slavic countries, I believe) is fond of [Kvass] a sort of low alcohol content beer-like beverage, sometimes carbonated
It has a history spanning thousand years, and the taste is sometimes described as liquid bread
Try it if you get a chance
English
In my opinion it just doesn't make sense to use a translation (however good it might be)n if you can use the original
Some games, however, include specific vocabulary which is connected to certain topics (I don't know what exactly
chemistry
Mechanics
) and I can understand people who use translation is such cases because your knowledge of English might be not enough
But personally, I don't play games with specific context so it is not my case
As for your edit, I usually play historical games (or fantasy like TES or TW3, but real world history is more preferable): strategic games (Paradox Interactive games), RPG games (currently playing Kingdom Come Deliverance)
I'd really like to play some RPG or adventure game about the 18th-early 19th century setting in Europe (7 years war, Napoleonic wars), but I haven't found anything in the industry that might be worth attention
English if I play alone, Russian if I play with friends (bc they don't know English well enough)
Yes if it's the game of English origin
Voices and translation usully better in this case and western developers mostly don't give a fuck about cyrillic fonts so you play with standard ones and it breaks immersion
If the game made by non-English people it sometimes better to play on Russian
Like, The Witcher is way cooler in Russian than in English
Obviously the games made by Russian speaking games (like STALKER, new King's Bounty series, Allods series etc) are much better in Russian
The only game worth listening to in czech is Mafia
I think it has some minuses, though
First, the technical aspect has some problems; sometimes the game bugs
Also the combat system becomes uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies
Finally, in the second part of the game it becomes too easy - you kill almost everyone with 2-3 hits
There are some op perks that kinda break the immersion (for example, the perk that allows you not to get hungry and tired unless you move
It literally makes the atmosphere of realism a little interrupted)
However, everything else is amazing: there are plenty of cool side quests, the visual style of landscape, models of characters, armour, etc
are excellent; despite being uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies, the combat system is great in duels
I learned a lot of things about middle-ages Czechia while playing it
Even though I haven't finished the game, I'm waiting for a sequel already
I hope it will fix things that I didn't like and make things I liked even better
One thing is for certain - KCD is a unique game and I will certainly remember this experience
I have just finished the monastery mission
P.S. I also found it strange when I learned that there is no Czech localisation, to be honest
Though sometimes they play songs in Czech on the background it cutscenes
But that doesn't has dabing
Sure
I meant the vocals (dub)
Oh, you have just started the game, I see
You have plenty of great things ahead, good luck
>Non-rural view rural as backwards, poor, stupid, and simple
Same here, except for stupid
Although people who have "rural" relatives may have a different opinion
Personally I think that I know as much as I need
Russian
I live in Russia and therefore it’s a language which everyone speaks here
Russian is my native language
English
I’m so grateful that I learned English back then just because it’s an international language and the whole world speaks English
The best language you can learn as not a native English speaker
Armenian
I’m Armenian and I have to know my natal language
Don’t forget your roots
There are a lot of Armenians in Russia so it facilitates my communication with them
I speak 8 languages and I still want to learn more because 1) I've got too much time on my hands
Someone get me a pet or something and 2) I like one spooking people in public by talking in random languages when buying groceries or somethin
Oh yes, I most certainly do
First, because I feel like knowing only English and Russian makes me backwards comparing to people around me
I don't know why, but everyone but me had 2 foreign languages (mostly took English and German/French) at school and I only had one and did not have time to attend any language courses apart from school
Second, I am majoring in History currently and I would like to build a career as a historian
I am planning to specialize on the 18th century Russia
The thing is, at that time (and later on) educated people and nobility whose writings make up a lion's of sources that a historian would work on, spoke French as their first language and used it more often than Russian, from around the middle of the century
Hence, for me it is crucial to know French (and also German, if possible) to work with those sources
Actually, I am soon going to take French classes in my university, so the problem will probably be solved in a couple of years
Then I am planning to expand my knowledge of languages - German, Italian and, maybe, Spanish
It’s the most popular language after Russian as elsewhere
But if you want to come here and feel comfortable as an English speaker, you will be disappointed
Maybe 1 out of 10 people will understand you and communicate with you
You should learn some basics and practice it
Watch a lot of videos and listen to Russian speech a lot
It will help you
I’ve seen all kinds of snow/ice sculptures but never with a candle inside, now I have to make one of those
Nuclear and thermonuclear tests aside, probably [Ufa train disaster] A gas leak on a pipeline destroyed two trains, killing 575 people
I started loving milk when I first visited Lithuania and bought some Polish milk there
It tasted very rich and sweet
How else would I make Blin
Kefir better
I don't know how to tell if milk is good quality, but it tasted better than the one I would by for the same price in Russia
I live in a very urbanised area, though
My grandmother lives on the edge of a small town and buys her milk from a barrel that delivers milk to her suburb every week
It is cheap and flavourful, but I wouldn't find that in Moscow/Moscow region
Yes
Warm milk with some honey in there always helps to recover
[Тьмутаракань] which is a medieval town of Taman Peninsula
88 mm - my favorite size
*Kto ne spryatalsya — ya ne vinovat* = "Whoever hasn't hidden, it's not my fault".
In Russian, it is «кто не спрятался — я не виноват», which literally translates to “if you haven’t found a place to hide, it’s not my fault”
in Russian it’s lopata as well (лопата)
amazing
How can it be misunderstood
Plus "не спрятался", although grammatically in the past tense, is actually talking about the present, as in "кто не спрятавшийся".
edit: I didn't notice the "if" part
Makes sense now
[Кембриджский словарь] приводит в пример такое предложение:
> Whoever they are, I don’t want to see them
Вроде, та же самая структура.
Russian is mostly the same wherever spoken
You wouldn't notice much difference in vocabulary except a couple of words throughout an entire conversation, if any
Russian is pretty uniform no matter where you are
So we don’t really have this problem
I personally would prefer if Ukrainians used Shto instead of Sho and G instead of Gh when speaking in Russia
Agreed 100%. It's so anti-Russian to say "sho" and "gh" that half of Southern Russia does that and a lot of people from Central Russia too (including most of my family)
I'm not saying it's anti Russian
I'm saying I'd prefer to hear the standard speech over these regional variations that make my ears bleed
That's all
It's similar to Turkey - his genuine supporters are uneducated ignoramuse - many of whom have never left the country, let alone learned a second language
Most educated people I speak with at the least have reservations, but Putin's whole thing is that, if people won't love him, they should at least fear doing anything
People keep their heads down and worry about themselves and their families
Some of the young just focus on emigration
There might well be a sense that "something" should be "done" but nobody wants to make the first move
That's my outlook as a foreigner living here, anyway
>who's critcs tend to "disappear", end up in prison or "accidentally" die
You know something isn't right when people who criticise Putin keep "accidentally" falling out of windows
Well, your post here is a testament tothe power of propaganda
That window falling is a meme perpetuated by cherry-picking articles is honestly the most obvious part
No, you won't get pushed out of the window for criticising Putin
Yes, there was one murder of investigative journalist who digged into Wagner PMC, however by the time he was killed he was on different task and most likely got into trouble with local crime organisation
There are great many critics of Putin in Russia, and probably top 10 of them are under any threat, it it is never a murder - ususally it's harassment and car burning etc
Most of them would have troubles with, say, becoming manager at Gazprom, and their organizations are under constant pressure, but almost none of them fear for their lives
The idea that critics of Putin get assassinated is based on a very special group of cases - Litvinenko, who was high profile security defector, and Nemtsov, whose assassination seemed to be a work of overly eager Chechen minions
Nemtsov was half-retired by then, and there were many more prominent people in opposition, and resonanse of his assassination speaks for itself in regard of frequency of such cases
It was the biggest scandal since muder of Politkovskaya
And three doctors falling out of windows is too incredibly overblown story
If any doctor who critisises Putin was thrown out of window, there would have been hundreds of cases
Two of these three were likely suicide attempts - who would have thought that during pandemic in country of 140 million people there would be several doctor's suicides
Third one was fall from second story window that didn't even kill a man who made a recovery since then (Shulepov)
This story is rather standart - yes, he critizised his superior who forced him to work despite having coronavirus
Rather petty affair
After social reaction, he was put into coronavirus hospital
When he recovered from ilness but was still confined to hospital, he once decided to smoke a cig and for that he tried to jump from window to rain roof over the entrance to hospital, but slipped and fell to the ground
Putin's assassins at their finest
As you can see, few cases of cherry picking by Western media(tm) - and reddit believes that in Russia criticising goverment will put you on hit list of Putin's defenestrators
When you wonder why Russians are this or that, remember that your vision of Russia is clouded in propaganda, as is vision of Russians themselves, so how you see things is wildly different
> I don't understand how the Russian regime thinks they have a right to steal the territory of other countries (like Crimea), and stage fake elections "proving" their "right" to steal said territory
Do you really not undertsand it or do you just express your condemnation this way
If you really don't undertsand it, there is a fuckton of resources about Russian stance on Crimea
Educating yourself on that rather important issue is probably worthwhile
In short: Russia considers annexation to be the will of Crimean people who were against Euromaidan and following coup
There is a rather solid framework under that kind of claims to people's self determination, even though Russia and many other countries usually supress any kind of sepratism
Among Russian society, belief that Crimea should have been Russian was always widespread because of historical ties
> I don't understand how the Russian regime can say other countries who don't have nukes or nowhere near the same amount of troops as them (like Norway), is "threatening" a nuclear power like Russia
By threataning Russian officials don't mean that they worry Norway will conquer Russia on its own
However Norway is in military alliance with powerful countries that oppose Russia
You can learn about this alliance more here  [
And us as well
You've got everything right
People who would fight for their rights don't do it because there is not enough solidarity
With how things are now, anything less than "all in" won't make a difference
And you just know you can't trust your neighbor to cover your back
Kind of
Drakon - any type of dragon
Zmej - the type of dragon in Slavic mythology
Vozdušnyj zmej - kite (literally "air zmej")
Zmeja - snake
> Zmej - the type of dragon in Slavic mythology
And most things called "serpent" in English
Zeleniy zmei - alchoholism
When I was little, I thought "змей" just meant male snake
Eat at McDonald’s. Why
I heard Germans rapidly treat fascists or those silly people screaming something like that
Is it really true
Is it true that you can get into jail if do some stuff connected with Nazi-Germany, swastika etc
Hamburg sounds really awesome
Feel like it would be one of my favorite places in Germany
We call it regions
Also zamkad'je - beyond MKAD (moscow automobile ring road)
There is Moscow and there is Russia
It is 2 different worlds
It is called провинция (province)
The difference is that it is used not only by people in Mocow, but also by people in the "second" capital, St

*Zifferblatt*), because it had never even occurred to me that it's a loanword until I started learning German, it just doesn't sound very foreign (e.g. French loanwords are very obviously french-sounding)
In German, *Zifferblatt* is simply "numbers+sheet of paper".
Another favourite is *шлагбаум* (I'm having trouble translating that into English
A turnpike
A gate
) It's basically a long pole that is lowered across the road in order to prevent cars from driving through (e.g. at a level railway crossing)
Anyway, I really enjoy the fact the in German, *Schlagbaum* literally translates to "falling/hitting piece of wood". Why didn't the Russian speakers think of that themselves
Bonus fact: apparently, nowadays German speakers don't really use *Schlagbaum* anymore and say *Schranke* instead (because *Schlagbaum* means there's like a person lifting this thing to let somebody through, and the correct word for a modern, automated gate is *Schranke
* In case there are any native German speakers reading this: Stimmt es
Yep, there are so many German words in Russian, it's unbelievable
Ones I could think of: Kurort, Kamin, Dübel, Streikbrecher, дуршлаг ("durshlag", eng
colander, from germ
*durchschlagen*)
Tatar, which is a turkic language in the Volga region with a population of around 5 million people (the size of Finland), which coexist with Russians in one country since 16 century and long before it as neighbours
What do native Finns think about Russians
Are they mostly anti-immigrant or maybe they don't really care
That's surprising
I would expect Turkish to be the second, and Russian to be in the first 5—10 languages
PS: a lot of Russians actually abused the program and used forged documents as "proof" of their German ancestry just to get out of Russia
> it's Russian if you only look at citizens
There was some easy way to get an EU citizenship through buying a property in Cyprus or something like that
Nobody speaks tatar to be honest
Then it's Russian and not Tatar, since not just Tatars speak Russian as the second language
I’ve met people who do
Are those Russians mostly tourists
They just know the language, but do they really use in their life
I visited Kazan a few years ago, and I often heard people speaking Tatar on the streets, including young people (teenagers and 20s)
I also heard a lot of code-switching between Russian and Tatar
They are computer-illiterate, but then I realized I am "car-illiterate": I know what the buttons on the dash do, but I have no idea how to perform any basic maintenance beyond adding more petrol or window washing fluid
Most of you are probably "bread-illiterate": you know how to buy bread, but not how to bake it
Even if you can bake it after the quarantine, you don't know how to grow and harvest wheat and to turn it into flour
I am an engineering student but I barely understand how a *radio* works, so actually understanding how my PC works is our of reach for now :/ I was growing up when computers were already heavily advanced, complicated and fairly widespread so just as the most of my peers, I am slightly good at using them (and sometimes some weird shit happens which I have no idea how to fix so I just format the entire disk and reinstall windows) and I can even put one together (with a lot of blunders) but my understanding of the physics behind them is non-existent
Not weird spellings, but we have Наталья/Наталия. Also, some male names can produce different patronymics: Валерьевич/Валериевич, Евгеньевич/Евгениевич, Никитич/Никитович *shudder*. People with и instead of ь spend their whole lives spelling out their names
"Ваши ФИО? - Иванова Наталия-через-и Евгениевна-тоже-через-и."
I once worked with a family here in Russia who told me they needed a teacher for their son "Eugene
" I'd assumed they'd called him that when we first spoke on the phone as a sort of way to make me feel comfortable with a foreign name
I arrive and I say "this must be little Zhenya
(Yevgeniy)
"No, his name is *Eugene
I don't know why, but I just found it sort of ludicrous; I don't really see the purpose in giving your kid a "foreign" name when that name already had its equivalent within your own language
Obviously people are free to do what they want, but I still consider it odd
>"No, his name is Eugene
So, Юджин? His kids patronymics will be interesting if that's really his official name in the documents
Though of course names are quite easy to change if one wants to
Yep, the name in his documents was, apparently, Юджин.
> His kids patronymics will be interesting if that's really his official name in the documents
Can't be worse than Оле говна.
Like *they* are pieces of shit, and they can blame their grandparents for that
I write a lot better than I speak, for sure
Still had to repeat what I was saying several times, every time I opened my mouth in the UK
> Don't be ashamed of your English and quit ending your posts with "sorry for my English, I'm [insert nationality]".
We should modify the subreddit style next April Fools so every comment ends with this line
How's it going on this sub then
:) I guess it's kinda hard to read posts if you don't know English
And also I often find myself trying to translate some phrases from my native language to English
Even though that's a common mistake, I just don't know how to say the same thing in English
Please excuse my English
Geordies are a breed apart
Even I couldn't understand them
>they must have some form prepositions I suppose, but IDK
Of course we do, but it can happen because we also have cases and many situations which in English depend on prepositions in Slavic languages depend on cases instead
So people struggle without needed case but don't know what to use to replace it
(Oops, was answering without reading fully first, so missed that it's about German)
It's more or less okay, don't worry man
Just keep learning it
If the railroad is *not* called "the iron road" in your language, what it's called and what does that mean
Is it called binari because there are two rails
That’s what most of my country is
You can just go into forests and people will never find you
Technically he was
Out current and previous leadrs were born in USSR
Are prime ministers that unimportant in Croatia
Why would people be completely ok with a pm who isn't fluent in their language
Russia has only two allies - the army and navy
Among countries I think better candidate is Belarus
If we exclude ex-USSR countries so I don't know maybe Serbia=)
China I think
for a few last years
Lmao
Russia doesn't have friends and probably never will
Even Belarus tries to find other relationships when it can
Belarus cause we were one thing from very start
No fucking way Chinese are our allies
They are spreading their influence in Central Asia, steal our technologies, try to exploit Siberia’s resources in the most barbaric way and undoubtedly would grab as much of Far East as they can if we become too weak
They are useful to make Americans busy and somewhat weaker, though
Canada is American Belarus, huh
It is seen from Russia as an opportunistic weathervane
Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Venezuela
An alliance anyone would dream of
But Russians don't claim that that Finland is a friend to begin with
Russia
Can you be more specific
What's wrong with spreading their influence in Central Asia
What technologies did they steal
How are they trying to exploit Siberia's resources if they can't access to it
Well, we were certainly very abusive friends to each other :x There was a time when Russia was an inch away from destroying Prussia and then Tsaritsa Elizabeth died; to be replaced by a dude who worshiped the ground Frederick the Great walked on
Before the um
/*clears throat*/ other Russian empress had him killed
You even wrote Russia with a small letter and Germany with a capital
How can we talk about a friendship
Anyone except the similarly lonely kid who compensates by studying obsessively and screwing his other classmates\* (China); or the sporty, handsome, rich dude who everyone orbits around but no one really likes (USA)
\*screwing as in making unadvantageous deals
I realized what that could also mean after I commented it lol
Belarus almost literally means it
There word Rus - the name of ancient Russia
Russia is greek form of Rus and Belarus mean White Rus
Belo-(or Bela-) it mean white
Geopolitical influence is a zero sum game
If they gain influence, we lose it
It is wrong because if we lose control over Central Asia the whole soft underbelly of Urals and Siberia would be defenseless
From economical point of view, Russian corporations benefit from business in Central Asian markets and Russia as a whole benefits from thousands of migrants working in Russian economy
Engines, planes, missiles, rockets, some ships
Look at their air force and say that those are 100% indigenous design
Their 5th gen fighter flies on Russian engines
Very easily
They find an alcoholic from a Siberian village, give him a bottle of vodka and he opens a company that starts digging gold/cutting trees/whatever
On paper it is Russian company owned by a Russian, but in reality the capital, management, employees, trade partners and clients are Chinese
And obviously the company will disregard all common sense and exploit the land it owns in the most barbaric way possible
Seven Years War, if made as an HBO adaptation would be heavily criticized for unrealistic plot twists for the sake for plot twists
> Rus - the name of ancient Russia
*A million of Ukrainians screamed and fell in silence*
Yeah
Beat that, EU
*sobs*
Lol no
We just don't have that kind of a connection to you anyway
Finland lost the war against USSR
interesting
ok, partly you may be right
A million descendants of the ancient great Ukr who dug the black sea
I don't care about their opinion
All Ukrainians whom I know are normal in history and know that the division of peoples into Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians occurred much later than Ancient Russia and all three peoples have the right to be called descendants of Ancient Rus
Our president
Laundry and the Ministry of Culture
I think, we can't even name all the local memes we have in runet)
We have exact the same in Russian, it's actually more popular than the other version
Basically whoever answers from Ministry of Culture mocks a word "laundry" in a rude way (making it similar to swear word) and is strikingly uncultured but proud to work in a Ministry of Culture itself and not in some laundry
Хуячечная (more like cuntaundry) is usually mentioned when our Ministry of Culture fucks up again, it's their code name
Why were some of the answers keelhauled all of a sudden
Creepy af
Oh shit, the mosquitoes
They ate me alive when I was in a similar region in Russia, and even sprays didn't help
> Now that I'm older I realize it was most likely some lazy bastard taking this route as a shortcut in bad weather
This is so weird, but I'd like to try something like that
This is hilarious, I saved your comment for future reference
1) "Kak skazhesh" meaning "as you [wish to] to say".
2) "Spravedlivo" or "rezonno" meaning fair/just/reasonable
I believe in some context you also could’ve been said “Ладно, проехали» or “Ладно, едем дальше” which is somewhat similar to “okay, let’s get over it” and literally means that you suggest to continue your ride
I guess "Jak chcesz" corresponds to "Kak hochesh" (meaning "as you want")
It can also be used as an equivalent of "fair enough", but it has a connotation of an uncomfortable compromise
One first name + [Patronimic] \+ one surname
Almost always wife will take her husband's surname, but she can also take a double surname (smth like Putin-Medvedeva, very rare) or it can be the other way around: husband will take his wife's surname (for example, if husband's surname means smth very unpleasant, exceptionally rare)
Native Siberian here, probably dead
If not, probably hunting for fur to trade/pay yasak (taxes)
Nowadays most commonly believed to live in [Veliky Ustyug] But Arkhangelsk and the Kola Peninsula have also been contenders
Isn't this place like the official residence of Santa
Like worldwide
Suprisingly wholesome
Xp or Vista I think is used in different organizations for billboards
I guess they don't really need more
My uncle used to work in a newspaper as a system administrator and he told me the story
On some kind of conference, where japanese scientists and techs came to Moscow to present something like 2gb hard drive or similiar thing, one journalist from this newspaper had a chance to make a long conversation with one of the scientists about tech parts of this invention
In the end japan guy suggested to leave some info for this journalist and asked for a flashcard or something
And then journalist came up with floppy disk
While their country is going into gygabyte era, we have this
Not even cd
Japan guy looked really stunned and ended up conversation rly fast
I love the story of BolgenOS
Some schoolkid from Siberia reskinned a common Linux distro for his school project and played it up as a new Russian-native OS
He got away long enough with it for the regional media to pick up the story and hail him as a homegrown wunderkind hacker
They even tried to defend his honor when actual sysadmins heard the news and started mocking him
Bless you
«Пошлый» (poshly, adjective) and «пошлость (poshlost’, noun)
It translates to vulgar, banal, platitudinous and all at the same time
I wanted to say exactly the same thing about Russian
Of course, there are sometimes other ways to express these nuanced meanings in English, but it's difficult to learn them because you can't just google a handy list of common particles
Hm, just like in Ukrainian
The word smazcny is also used here in Russia
["Ship-house" or "Home of Atomists"] This is so ugly and monstrous
Well, soviets built it, what else could I expect
[Also this is how a default Russian bedroom district or a suburb area looks like] . Nowadays these districts sometime gets mixed with modern, a bit less uglier but taller warrens
We've got enough of them that there's a top (bottom
) 100:
I especially hate 46, 45, 40, 29, 27, 26, 18, 12 and 7
All of them except 12 are from Moscow, and thus I can actually be offended by how they look often enough, and 12 is just soul-crushing
Moscow City as a district:
I would say that half of them looks ok
There is a lot of really ugly but not all
Varlamov is a good blogger urbanist but he is often very biased
Last one (#1) is straight up cool
Or like a citadel from Half Life 2 or something
We had "Fundamentals of Orthodox culture", "Fundamentals of Islamic culture", "Fundamentals of Buddhist culture", "Fundamentals of Jewish culture", "Fundamentals of world religious cultures" and "Fundamentals of secular ethics" and parents should have choose one of those subjects in 4th grade, but I heard that now there's only last two subjects left
Yes, in the 4th grade we had a class in which we were taught basic aspects of all major religions or (if our parents expressed a desire to) of the Orthodox Christianity/Islam specifically
Also in the 9th grade we had a class that taught us about the history of Christianity in our region of Russia
We learned about the major architectural sights that were connected with the Church, some local saints and stories of their lives, etc
My parents chose secular ethics so I didn't, I think it was in world religious cultures
I’d just make a new one, closer to Siberia
That place really needs some economic incentives to develop
Troll option: Kiev
Literal middle of the country: Noriljsk
Mean centre of population: somewhere on the shores of Kama in Udmurtija
Close to Transsib, so a high-speed train line to Moscow is a possibility
You’re right; Chelyabinsk is a great location
But since I’m from Yekaterinburg, I have an obligation to make a counter proposal to move the capital to it lol
We're very important because Russia, as the main aggressor, takes dissatisfaction with internal problems of European countries from them
It is also easy to blame her, both correctly and incorrectly
We're used to it
We are playing the role of the enemy  and often fairly
And, of course, we have some oil and gas
It's a mixed bag, but most downsides come from the fact that it's poorly managed and doctors underpaid, not from being free, because it's not
You can still go to a private clinic if you like, and even though it's not a pleasant spending for most people, it's still a fraction of what you'd have to pay in the US even taking the discrepancy in wages into account
> Yes, there are downsides like people abusing the system or leeching from it
In Russia, old grannies who have nothing to do will queue up starting from 7am to "measure blood pressure". That's basically how they socialise and it's quite innocent if you ask me, but what would be some other ways to abuse healthcare
Of course, you will ignore the fact that a) a lot of (most
) immigrants *are* contributors because they came to their new country exactly for employment reasons, and b) that a lot of citizens are *not* contributors (children, students, unemployed people
But as others have noted, your response is very factually incorrect regardless (although I guess the details might probably depend on the exact country, but it's not like you're presenting it)
Well, it's usually the customers themselves who pay for "free" stuff because it's part of a purchase
And yeah, that's the exact thing I'd say in that situation
But back to your own analogy
Everyone who has an income gives away their own share, or who do you think is the "owner"?
Most European languages make no sense to me since I don't speak them
I would like to say Eesti, but since i started to listening their rap it became less wierd,so id say Turkish
Moreover, Portuguese sounds like "gibberish Russian".
It is still not as strange as Chinese counting system
When 1 million is a hundred of ten thousands, that’s beyond good and evil
You are "behind" the computer in Russian too
Never thought about that, lmao
> why so many genders
How about [Tuyuca] with 50-140 noun classes
Two types of plurals
If you're referring to the dual number, it's only found in Slovene, Sorbian, and some dialects of Serbo-Croatian
*dragostea din tei*
It's more of a Polish speaking Spanish, both are fond of nasals and sibilants
Yes, it just sounds like you use the Russian sounds but different words
Russian and Porruguese have very similar phonetics
The alphabets are very similar and work on the same principle
If you know one of them, you can easily learn the other one (and all Russians, maybe save some hypothetical exceptions, know the Latin alphabet)
I'm Russian and I agree your language does sound similar to mine
> was
It is still used during messes, isn’t it
That sounds really similar to Russian, and that's one of the problems that learners face while learning the language
Ah, yeah, that's very weird
It could be rendered in English as "cats", "1 cat", "2—4 of cat", "5—20 of cats", and then again (and that's until you start declining the numerals themselves
) :D
Portuguese sounds like SEX to me
If sex was a language, it would be Portuguese
Yeah, that's actually one of the similarities
Portuguese, like Russian but unlike Spanish, reduces unstressed vowels a lot (actually Spanish sounds a bit aggressive to me because they don't reduce the vowels; it feels like they are shouting, even if they aren't)
Being Russian, I was often told by my Portuguese/ Brazilian friends that Russian is the weirdest-sounding language that they'd heard
So I asked them to speak Portuguese
I heard that cadence, the fluidity of the language, the subtle nasal vowels and I was sorta turned-on, ngl
Idk, it's just very smooth, very sensual and it FLOWS, if you know what I mean
Just like sex
I like how it sounds because it sounds similar to Russian, and Russian/any Slavic language is very pleasant to my ear
To me, neither Russian nor German sounds brutal
I guess the brutality of German is more of a stereotype, and I actually understand how it's seen as brutal when I watch how Hitler is depicted in movies and the like
The thing is that no one actually speaks like that in real life, and, to me German sounds really soft and pleasant
On the other hand, Spanish, French and Italian sound harsh to me, despite the clichés about "the most romantic languages in the world".
In Russia our school day starts at 8
30 am
Usually we have like 6-7 lessons per day (so this means that the school day ends at 2
30 pm or 3
30 pm)
One school our is 45 mins
After every lesson we have a break (15 mins after first, the same after second and third
A break after fourth lesson is 20 mins, after 5th is 30 mins
And 15 mins after 6th lesson again)
Second breakfast (so we call it) starts after the second lesson, but honestly the food there is not really tasty and I'm usually not really hungry till then, so I always skip it
Lunch time for 9-11 years/graders starts at 12
10 pm (after the 4th lesson)
Lunch for 5-8 years/graders is at 1
15 pm
You can also use a buffet (I hope, this is the right word to use
This is the place where you can buy snacks or something) after the second lesson as I remember
The canteen closes at 2
45 pm
The Library opens up after the second lesson and stays open till i-don't-know-when
Sometimes our librarian has some other things to do (some concerts that they are to attend to be in the jury and so on)
In those cases the library might be closed earlier
Well, this is pretty much everything I could remember
If I remember something else, I'll make an update
January 7
The Russian Orthodox Church still uses the Julian calendar, so their December 25 translates January 7 in the real world
Because it's after the New Year, Christmas is not celebrated much outside of the religious context, it's just another day of the winter holidays for others
The main celebrations happen on the New Year, so starting from December 31 and into the night of January 1
January 7th, which is a common date for countries that are/were majorly Orthodox Christian
Although it's a national holiday, it's nowhere near New Year in popularity
It's not celebrated mostly because the Soviet regime made NY a thing
It wasn't going to allow Christmas to remain a big deal
> Both my parents' families live roughly 120 km from us
Russians and Americans: oh, it's so convenient to live so close to your parents
Usually by clothes
Large mink coats and hat,leather jaket, or tight T-shirt with a huge [RUSSIA] inscription on both sides
I noticed it when i was in Karlovy Vary
Oh god oh fuck
Yeah, those eyes look stereotypically French to me
I've been to UK three times, but funnily enough, have never been to London
I'm in academia, so I had to visit Cambridge for a student conference and poster presentation (we had a boat trip across the city river and lived in a Harry Potter-like school, complete with looong dinner tables), Glasgow for a science outreach event (I expected locals to have incomprehensible accents, but it was actually fine), and Manchester for a kidney conference (all the students and professors went to a Chinese restaurant after the event, I saw a bull kidney on the menu and thought "well, I study them, time to find out what they taste like")
They are somewhat softer than the beef by texture, but not as soft as mushrooms
The taste was mostly  hot Chinese spices, but I enjoyed it
Would eat it again if I had the chance
Imagine how many minds can be blown when they found out that Hungary, a country, also has its own regions
Crazy stuff
> CNMI
Clothed Nebraska, Maked Illinois
I realise that
But country size isn't relevant here, I'm just joking about the fact that other countries do have their own regions, which might actually surprise some people
Thats the good thing about slavic languages
We can switch word orders to make it sound better or worse
In Russian, the word order still sometimes matter
- Я не могу больше пить: I can’t drink any more
- Я могу больше не пить: I can stop drinking
Finnish
Since I live really close to Finland, I figured I'd give it a try
"*How hard could it be
I've learned hard languages before*."
I gave up after two days
As for European countries, it's Hungarian
Tricky pronunciation and writing, difficult grammar
German yeah, wayyyy too many grammar rules
I’m from Russia and I think that Russian and Chinese are the hardest languages
Our teachers told us that Russian grammar is one of the hardest to learn and understand
Maybe we should just both stick to English, eh
Belter wee cow, aye
Gaun irn bru
I wish
(I live in France, I’m from Russia)
It’s much better than what I’m used to
Irish people, how often do you use Irish language in your everyday life
I've heard that language situation in Ireland is very bad and Irish language is going extinct
Is that true
a very large amount of Russian women believe in horoscope, astrology, etc
across all generations, and a vile feedback loop has been created where because they like it TV shows and media aimed at women seek to include more of this stuff, which in turn makes them like it more, which makes more of it added to media, etc
etc
Same thing with "psychics" which woman of all ages eat up like candy
There's also a lot of shit about aliens, major tv channels regularly run stuff on the level of america's ancient aliens show, this being more what poisons men's minds
A  lot of people in Russia believe that USSR has never dissolved, and we are all occupied by Russian government
They call our passports "Ausweis"(if i remember correctly an ID used by Third Reich on occupied territories) and prove that with some stupid shit about documents signed in 1991 (like USSR here called Russian Federation, so those documents are not in power)
NFKRZ made a video on this
* Horoscopes, crowns of celibacy, spells are popular among most women
* China makes low-quality goods on purpose to harm Russian people with hidden toxic materials
* The US placed a chemical laboratory in Georgia to attack the Russian population with new viruses
Looks like 11 centuries is not enough to convert pagans to Christianity
Lol
Exactly what I mean
Otherwise sane people will shill this stuff and it fucking sucks, I hate having to deal with it from my mother and cousins
there's also a little bit of that in Russia, like apparently it's really bad luck to step over someone
Absolute bs
I also hate dealing with wannabe astrologers and homeopaths
I was absolutely livid when a vet prescribed homeopathic injections to my cat (травматин)
The cat (just like the Russian Academy of Sciences) doesn’t believe in homeopathy so the placebo effect is impossible
Why torture the creature
And it was a private clinic
I used to enjoy crackpot shows on Ren TV about aliens and mutants and conspiracies
[This guy] is also pretty entertaining
39% of Europe is Russia bro
Early 2000s was nice for this crackpot and conspiracy since there was less pseudoscience and it was more just historic recounting of past stuff with interviews and stuff, it never implied what was said was true
But as the stuff has to be made more normie accessible and entertaining they turn it to bullshit
"war of the psychics" was also really bad, which I forgot to mention in OP
It's not the same thing as astrology but it ties in very strong, largely with the same female demographic
Well, its in the eye of the beholder
In the eyes of Chinese Russia is as Western as Germany and France
Russian wikipedia is the 6th largest wikipedia, so it's quite big and comprehensive
The only problem is that a lot of politically sensitive topics are not written from a neutral point of view because there are too many editors pushing their pro-Russia POV
I think this started in 2014 after Ukranian Euromaidan, and many Ukraine-related articles are not neutral
One has to say that Ukranian wikipedia is even worse in this regard, but that's not the point
English wiki is somewhat better because there are simply more editors, but still there are popular articles where a group of people are pushing their POV
The best example is [Russo-Georgian\_War] it's really one-sided
I mostly use Wikipedia to read about languages and linguistics and I find that English Wikipedia tends to be more comprehensive in this area
Hell, even many articles about Russian are more informative in English
Sometimes, though, the Russian version can be more complete, and then I switch to Russian
I use Russian WP for articles about Russian towns, rivers and minor historical figures
For other topics I use the English WP
It depends on region
I work in a hotel and a lot of people from different Russian regions come here (Caucasus, Pyatigorsk) and ask my staff about drinking tap water
They ask if it’s clean here
A lot of people from Moscow ask that question by the way
I drink tap water all my life though
In Vyborg (an old Swedish town, so I would count it as Europe even though it's Russia now) there's little to no restoration going
It's a big hit on old European culture because the architecture of 17th, 18th, 19th centuries is getting withered and not restored at all and even if it is quite badly
The city had already list a lot of buildings and great sights during the war so the situation is pretty bad
Only now with citizens rising up the local government started working a little bit on it and the main square looks nice now
That's still tons of work to do
Not worse than any other traffic incident
Trams usually derail on turns or junctions, where speeds are low (at least in St
Petersburg, it also happens often here)
Interesting=) We have a very similar idiom here in Siberia
Siberian is not who doesn't feel cold
Siberian  is who dresses warmly
Agreed on bar food in Korea
In many countries bar food is very crappy and mediocre, but Korean bars usually have very good fried chicken
Found food in Canada to be very interesting
Could eat poutine and tourtiere 24/7
Also loved the bakeries all over the city
Sometimes it feels nice to take a taxi ride where the driver is in complete silence, and for people to give you a meter of personal space
But I think living in such a culture for years will become maddeningly impersonal and even depressing
If I have a bad day, having a nice chat with a barista or taxi driver can be massive in lifting up my mood
I didn't know Köln is Cologne, but Köln I heard of
Next one is Zaragoza
Sorry, my fellow Spaniards
Duisburg
By the way, I remember how a few years ago I was surprised by the fact that Cologne is German
I mean, it doesn't sound like a German name at all
Gothenburg and Bochum
Turns out the first one was just Göteborg, so I expected Bochum to be another anglicized spelling, like Gothenburg, Leghorn and Nuremberg
But no, Bochum was unknown to me
Köln
Yes, this variant of a name is more familiar to me
That depends on which languages you already speak, but the simplest advice I could give is don't get hung up on the alphabet
Learning a language takes years (regardless of the language), while learning the alphabet will take you a few hours to a few days
Strč prst skrz krk is after a all a valid sentence
Started to learning it few days ago, where are you finding content on Swedish
Why does everyone seem put off by genitive plural
Why is it more difficult than other case-number combinations
> As in, they tend to have less and less rules and more exceptions to those rules
The loss in morphology is usually compensated with new syntactic rules
For instance, English lost cases but developed a strict word order, while most Slavic languages have cases and a rather free word order
Sometimes the opposite is happening when syntactic forms (such as particles) merge with words and create inflection
Currently, in Serbian there are 2 ways to form the future tense: one is by using an auxiliary verb + the infinitive of a meaning verb, as in "ću (auxiliary) pokušati (infinitive)"; the other one is by inflecting the verb itself, as in "pokušaću". The suffix "ću" is actually the result of merging between the infinitive and the auxiliary verb
That's how new inflection paradigms evolve in languages
Cases can emerge in a similar manner through the fusion between prepositions + nouns
I've read somewhere that many languages evolve in cycles between analyticity (grammar is mainly contained in syntax) and syntheticity (grammar is mainly contained in morphology)
> Latin has six cases, and so does Ancient Greek, Italian and other Romance languages have none, German has four
I'm not sure of what the main ancestor of Finnish could be considered, but either your language changed little with time and for some reasons didn't go throught the same process as most other languages, or they must have had an unrealistic number of cases
All the languages you've mentioned except Finnish are Indo-European and are said to have the same origin of their cases (just German has lost some of its cases and it can be speculated that it's currently in the process of losing the genitive case; Spanish has 6 cases for personal pronouns)
Finnish isn't an Indo-European language, so it's case system is quite different from the other languages you're talking about
But it has to be said that this cycle can take time different to other languages
Czech has 7 cases Russian has officially 6, 7th is unofficial
Development on that part was slow
Still trying, so hard to find something especially with subtitles compared to English and Russian
So it's 9 million Swedish speaking people and that's explaining it all
Genitive in German is used in a limited number of situations, such as showing possession or using it when required by a preposition or a verb (which there are few)
Like the other commenter says, genitive is often replaced by dative, and possession is indicated by other constructions
The Wiki article about [Swiss German] says that Swiss German doesn't have genitive whatsoever except some dialects that indicate possession with genitive
Yes, would be nice leave it here, people who learning svenska will find it handy in this thread

The knowledge that Eastern Europe lives in a parallel universe
Can you say "A with B" instead of "A and B" in Dutch
I don't remember the exact terminology, but that's a feature shared by a number of European languages, including Russian and not including English
I used to say "how is it called
" in English, but I've been corrected by native speakers multiple times
That's considered to be a typical mistake made by native Russian speakers
Perhaps there's a regional variation in English, so it's acceptable in Ireland
Perhaps it's the influence of Irish Gaelic
I've read you guys have quite a few of those (like "I'm just after doing something
" instead of "I have just done something" etc
That's more like a single item
What about less connected pairs, like "Me with my friends went to the park" or even "Could you buy some cigarettes with vegetables on your way home"?
Americans, Brits and Australians
Right
But that would be perfectly acceptable in Russian
Our mothers say 3, 5, 6, 7 from your list too
There's definitely more, but I can't remember any
> were you born in a barn
Ours say "were you born in an elevator
I heard only 3, 6 and 7
Never heard anything like this
Maybe you didn't pick your nose that much because I definitely did
I have
The explanation is that you don't need to close elevator doors because they close on their own
Same here with cuts and bruises: "it'll get better by your wedding". I actually cut my palm on a sewing machine chassis a few days before my wedding and didn't find this remark funny at all
Oh, I see
But still never heard it in my childhood (born and raised in Moscow)
As someone who have been several times in England, i am telling you that the first law is REALLY not enforced ahaha
Is it really illegal to keep a hamster alone or did you just use an example of an animal you thought needed a buddy to live with to be happy
Hamsters are extremely solitary animals so it would be weird and harmful
Idk out of all of this and the only thing that really weirded me out was the part of having a buddy for you hamster, lol
90% of time - yes
Most of the time yes
However, there are some ambiguous situations:
* how should I spell that unstressed vowel
(most of the time, you have 2 alternatives but sometimes more; like "o" vs "a")
* is that voiceless consonant at the end of a syllable spelled as voiceless or voiced
(like "т" vs "д")
* is that consonant spelled the way it sounds or is that a simplified pronunciation of a consonant cluster
(like "сч" pronounced as "щ")
* does this consonant cluster have any silent letters that aren't pronounced due to assimilation
(like "ndsk" pronounced as "nsk")
Perhaps there are more, but these come up immediately
Russian
In almost all cases you will determine and know spelling of each word
Not if it's a word you've never heard before
Then unstressed a/o and и/е will trip you up
Speakers of Russian have an easier time deciding whether it should be "ó" vs "u" or "rz" vs "ż" because they correspond to different sounds in Russian ("ó" -> "o", "u" -> "u", "rz" -> soft (palatalised) "r", "ż" -> "ż")
I guess the point is that is sounded like Dutch
Ukrainian uses "i" when it formerly had "o"/"e" and in the following syllable it had "ь"/"ъ" ("печь/pechь" became "пiчь/pichь"; "носъ/nosъ" became "нiс/nis")
However, in inflected forms, "о"/"е" is kept when it's followed by another syllable ("пiчь" -> "печi"; "нiс" -> "носа")
Also, it uses "i" when it formerly had "ѣ", and in this case it's kept in all forms ("хлiб/hlib" etc
That happens in many languages over time (look at English, French, Russian, and Danish; their spelling is more atrocious than Polish)
Spelling is always changing more slowly than language
And Poles say "drzewo" ("джево")
Ukrainian is closer to Polish in terms of vocabulary but to Russian in terms of phonology
My favorite one would be “the white friend”, so “throwing up” would sound like “hugging the white friend”.
I heard some people calling it “The Tundra”
My favorite one is "кабинет задумчивости" (roughly translates as "the cabinet of thoughtfulness")
I'm pretty sure I heard that in some cartoon
My grandmother calls it that too
Harry, you don't suppose to speak Parseltongue near muggles
My primary school English teacher pronounced "that's right" as "zats right" and I always assumed she was saying the Russian word "zasrat" as I wasn't really good at English
The Russian word means "to shit all over something".
And mine to "maia hi" (sorry to any Romanians here if the spelling makes your eyes bleed, but I found different versions in google, so I don't know which one is correct)
> As someone learning Spanish: where
Which words
My life is a lie
Everywhere except in the beginning of a word after a pause, or after n, m, l.
If you don't get bored with the IPA notation for sounds, you might like the [Wiki article about Spanish phonology] Those articles exist for most "popular" languages
Once Ivan Grozny died shit hit the fan
But wait
We found his long dead son Dmitriy
This time for real
He somehow still alive YEARS after his death, speaks Polish, doesnt recognize anyone, acts not like Russian
Looks like our guy, right
Oh wait no, it took time but we discovered he was Polish agent, so we killed him, burned him and shoot his ashes into direction of Warsaw
But wait
We found his long dead son Dmitriy
This time for real
He somehow still alive YEARS after his death, speaks Polish, doesnt recognize anyone, acts not like Russian
Looks like our guy, right
We did it 14 times
Yes there was 14 LzheDmitriys (False-Dmitriy)

Same happened to Finland and he rejected the throne and all the other candidates were also from Germany which they didn't really want to align with (in 1918 when Germany was losing) so Finland became a republic
Right, sorry
We are that bad
In school i was like "okay, that was dumb
Okay THAT time that was dumb
Okay THAT ti
wait how many times you fell for it
" (It was more or less different scenaries that not always included Poland, but 14 times thing is true and insane
Its like antipope thing)
Yeah, that one

Any information on how the ship that was sank was named
I have a Soviet-era book about all naval ships of Soviet Russia of Civil War times, but I don't remember this moment
Probably wasn't mentioned for censorship reasons, as USSR and Czechoslovakia were allies in 1981
> so it literally means "country where the language of the people is spoken".
Everyone from a Slavic language background knows that you guys don't speak a language
Germans are called "niemcy" (or similar words), literally "mute people".
We're actually advised to eat ice-cream when having a cold as it helps to ease throat pain
So Czechia and Slovakia were part of Austro-Hungary
In WWI Austro-Hungary was against Russia, and many mobilised Czechs and Slovaks (I don't know how to make this form, I'm sorry) didn't want to kill other Slavs and deserted
In Russia, their position was much different from position of other prisoners of war, and they were allowed to retain their arms
After February revolution there were ideas of Russia capitulating, but Chechoslovakians didn't want to give up
Since Russia was divided from allies by Germany, Austro-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria, it was decided to tranfer them via Pacific to USA and then via Atlantic to Britain and France
Problems began when it turned out that Transsib (a railroad that was used to tranfer Czechoslovakians to Pacific) was in bad condition
Even though Soviet authorities claimed that this plan is still desired to be completed, a lot of rumors (I don't know how truthful they were) began among Czechoslovakians that Soviets actually wanted to mobilize them into Soviet army
Since Czechoslovakians were all over the Transsib, they probably caused more problems to Soviet Russia than intervention of Britain and France in North Russia — remember their privilege over ordinary prisoners of war, permission to retain arms
TIL a shamrock is not a four leaf clover, but another name for a regular clover
Alright, I found that one
In this Soviet book it's said "in August 1918 due to bad technical condition and inaccessibility of repair after damage in the battle Байкал was disarmed and reverted to civil service and was scrapped after Civil War ended".
Even if it was really just an irreparable damage, and even more so if it actually was sinking, good job on dealing with ice-strengthened (thus hull was much stronger than that of other merchant ships) ship that had a 6-inch gun
We had the soviet "пионеры" (pioneers)
We don't anymore
Yeah, I imagine, aside from the fact that party loyalty was compulsory, Pioneers were probably fun to hang out with
I mean, yeah, of course we have some kind of organized outdoor activities for youth, it's just they pale in comparison with what we had previously
I personally have never even heard specifically of Russian scouts
Look at the numbers: there are a few scout organisations, and most of them have somewhere between 1000-2000 members (with exactly one exception of >10000)
And that's in a country of 145 million people
Unfortunately, scouting isn't that big these days
In Russia there are some places with Roman ruins
I don't want to touch the Crimean peninsula, so I tried to find somewhere else
We have Antic town Tanais near Rostov-on-Don
Also there is Phanagoria (near Sennoy, Krasnodar krai)
To be honest, it's not really Roman ruins, it was Bosporian Kingdom and later, the Kingdom of Pontus
It was connected with Roman world, everyone knows Mithridates the Great
And it was located throw the all Russian coast of Black sea
Near the village Arkhipo-Osipovka (near Gelendzhik, Krasnodar krai) there were found remains of a Roman watchtower
This love song from 90s
[Loneliness is a bitch] and [Someday you] both by Slava
I just love beats in both
Many things are great here but climate is not one of them
Russian women are the most beautiful, that’s a thing a lot of people agree with in Russia
Let’s say slavic women *
Ahahah, love you Belarus
Ehm, not at all
I didn’t say that all of them are beautiful, but it’s definitely not the place where the women are the ugliest
Not sure about this information
I know some people who don’t like it and zoomers are mostly indifferent
English cheese is good
And English pies
And English tea
By that measure most French cheeses aren't French
My East Slav radar works pretty well
I can mistaken a Ukrainian for a Russian, but usually East Slavs are rather easily distinguishable from Western Europeans and Anglo-Saxons
Somewhere during Oktoberfest in Bavaria I met this dude and we recognized we spoke in the same accent so we started a conversation, he was just visiting for the beer from Chelyabinsk and after that I never saw him again
Not from my country but Russian speaker
He asked me to take a picture of him in front of Eiffel Tower then asked if I speak Russian (based on my accent probably)
We went to drink coffee and chat and while ordering barista asked us in Russian: do you want milk
Had a good laugh
For a record: I'm Russian, the guy is Ukrainian and barista from Moldova
Yeah, just yesterday happened with a Russian person lol
Lots of Russian people abroad (including me) socialize with non-Russians a lot so tend to lose our culture and our distinctive accent
Happens a lot
After 5 years living in France I may confirm - it's 99
9% true
In the same time, I met several French people in France who spoked English with me and I didn't realise that they are French until I asked them
Though, to be honest, it's not only French accent is so strong - Russian and German as well for me =)
Why do you switch to English when you talk to each other
Usually, I can spot a person who speaks Russian from their first word but often enough a person is actually Romanian or Polish
The languages are very different yet the small accent similarities are still there
Often enough, visual cues are a great help: you can easily spot Slavs and people from the 'stans'.
The only difficulties I've ever had were people who had Russian as a second language and thus spoke English perfectly
I know what you mean, sometimes I see a girl on Tinder/Badoo that looks East Slavic, then talk, she says she’s from UA/BL/Ru, I look at her photo again and think “yeah, typical [bulbash/hohol/kacap]”.
But, it’s not really reliable
Especially if a person spent some time abroad and has changed from it “pure form”. If you know know what I mean
Do you have brown hair and slightly wide cheekbones
If yes, her radar works fine, you just haven’t realized yet who you really are
I actually can spot people from the stans or other parts of Russia easily, but struggle locating people from St
Petersburg or Moscow
Since these people generally appear more westernized
That happens a lot in Asia
There are relatively many Russians nowadays, especially in China, and when locals see a white dude with brown hair they automatically assume that you're a Russian
Yeah, the people from the regions and the 'stans' are really obvious (sometimes not in a good way, unfortunately) but I guess living in Moscow for 16 years helped me with identifying fellow Muscovites
Nothing wrong with the stans, I personally really like the culture
But it's very easy to tell where they are from just by the expression on their faces
I'm from the stans so yeah, not trying to insult the culture here, it's more of a speech and behaviour patterns I'm talking about :P
It's funny you should mention facial expression - I currently live in a city where a lot of Russians come for holidays, and I like to joke around with my friends that if you see a person who looks both miserable and angry for no reason whatsoever, it's ~~probably~~ always a Russian
The Russian frown never goes away, even after living abroad for many a year
People always think I'm miserable when I'm really not
Ulyanovsk
It is only memorable as a place of birth of Lenin, the city itself is just provincial and boring
If Russian cities are excluded, then Cologne
It is very obvious it was almost destroyed during WW2
The Cologne Cathedral is breathtaking and certainly worth visiting
Fortunately, it's right outside the train station, so you can arrive, visit the cathedral and then leave
I think Moscow
What
Absolutely not
I don't know, this looks fine to me, could be worse
I'm not into nightlife at all; as a tourist, I usually visit cities for architecture, parks, museums
And I haven't been to that many cities outside Russia (maybe like 15, and mostly capitals)
I'm sure there are many cities, but Cologne was one of the most boring cities outside Russia for me so far
Nothing wrong with a pljeskavica
I'm a huge fan of Art Nouveau, so Brussels is on my list
Even if the only thing I will do there is take pictures of Art Nouveau houses lol
Post-soviet countries have the cheapest internet not just in Europe but in the world
A bag of 100 costs like €15 in Moscow
Is it too expensive
Once we were caught by the thunderstorm and heavy rain in the mountains at night
We spent few hours holding tent together and guessing if we are low enough to avoid lightning strike
It was scary at first, but over time it became boring
Just half-sleep, loud bangs, bright flashes and hammering rain which spalled onto my face as a water spray
In other situations i love thunderstorms
But not when they interrupt my sleep
How would you call a kick scooter in polish
In Russian it's Samokat
Planes in Russian are also Samolyot, but car is avtomobil' (I guess we just borrowed this one) or mashina (like machine)
Привет, я Джон. Рад познакомиться. Ты откуда?
Hi, I John
Glad to know you
You where from
I can't really translate "pleasure to meet you" in Russian and back again
So that's the best variant I could think of
Привет, меня зовут Денис. Рад тебя видеть. Откуда ты?
Hello, they call me Denis
Happy you to see
Where from you are
>I can't really translate "pleasure to meet you" in Russian and back again
So that's the best variant I could think of
Приятного познакомиться
Read some classic Russian literature to find out
Jokes aside, the task was to form a sentence in my native language and then translate it into English word for word, right
If that is the case, then I don't understand what the English word Pleasure has to do with anything
In Russian the sentence "Pleasure to meet you" consists of two words "Рад познакомиться". I could translate "Рад" into English as "I am glad" but that would be the whole sentence instead of one word
So I've choose to translate it like "Glad". That was the translation of the first word
Let's move to the second one
One could translate the word "Познакомиться" into English as "to familiarize". But I've chosen to do it differently because in Russian Познакомиться is formed from "Знать" which means "to know".  Познакомиться = to know you
So again it would be a whole sentence instead of one word
Thus, I've decided to translate Russian sentence "Рад познакомиться" (I am glad to know you) as Glad to know
if you really want to stick to "word for word" rule it would be Glad know, but it doesn't really have mach sense
So now you know that in Russian meeting people has nothing to do with pleasure :D
I'm not a native speaker so I expect to be corrected, but I'd thought приятного (which means appropriate/comfortable/polite) was a rough equivalent in this context
Приятного познакомиться is like "it's pleasant to make your acquaintance
Ну, если есть желание пуститься во все тяжкие, то тогда уж "Приятного познокомления"  :D
На да, признаю: опростоволосился чутка. Не так понял задачу: я составил предложение на русском и перевёл на английский, а не английскую фразу перевёл на русский и обратно на английский. Посыпаю голову пеплом и рыдаю крокодиловыми слезами.
А если серьёзно, то... можно же не меня поправлять, а предоставить свой вариант ответа! Хотя, по-моему, только месье особо тонко разбирающийся в извращениях мог поставить такую задачу: с английского туда и обратно. Дословно. Это как-то слишком жутко для меня. Моя бедная русская языка такого не выдержит.
Well I'm outdone, no way I'm going to be able to read all that
My point was that we're literally taught, when studying Russian as a foreign language, that Приятного познакомиться means "nice to meet you" (though maybe "a pleasure to make your acquaintance" is closer) - of course приятно is more like pleasant/appropriate, at least by my understanding, but it certainly seems close enough that I'd feel it's justifiable to say it's an equivalent
Thanks
Cultural exchange at its finest :) Although, I guess i have some advantage here doe to ability to somewhat read Latin letters
I often hear foreigners say that they can not understand Cyrillic at all
There is a Canadian even who thought Cyrillic is some sort of a cipher since it has letters and numbers mixed up together
Like Ч (ch) look a lot like 4 and З (z) looks just like 3
The very reason he started to study Russian
And I guess it's also the reason all Hollywood "Russian" words are always just some jibberish
First of all, I'm sorry, I thought you can speak Russian
My bad
Second, "Приятного познакомиться" is just some nonsense
The phrase you're meaning to say is "Приятно познакомиться" which means "Мне приятно с тобой познакомиться" (I'm pleased to meet you
Third, I admit I've got original task wrong
Forth, If you want to suggest you translation - feel free to post it under the original post
Different people would come up with different translations ether way
There is no need to correct one another
And finally, if you can't understand some of the phrases I've used in my previous comment - ask away
My English isn't particularly good, but I'll do my best to help you
[European viper]
[Siberian tiger]
[Brown bear]

Now you know why there's so many empty lands across Siberia
Also ticks, boars, moose
Yeah, I think nowadays it's not quite accurate
While Russia still declares itself as a semi- presidental republic, Putin accumulated a lot of power in the past 15 years, making Russia effectively a full presidental republic

As opposed to Kingdom of Bulgaria without political parties and the government appointed by the Tsar
I guess it would be better for everyone if they didn't ally with the Nazis, but that was not an option and not up to them to decide sadly
Just like sliding out of Soviet sphere of influence
That's history
Like it or not
Not quite sure what you're trying to tell me
I just mentioned that Bulgaria turned from dictatorship to dictatorship
And they were caught between superpowers who didn't give the right of choice to their satellites
Western (democratic, if you will) model was better than Soviet socialism, but that was far from obvious up until late 70s.
> that was not an option and not up to them to decide sadly
Personal freedom is exactly my point
Bulgaria as well as many other nations, and by nations I mean common people in the first place, were forced into something what they didn't want
No matter if they were democratic or not
> we had to join the Axis or we would have been invaded

In Russian there is also an incredible amount of cuss words, i’m not sure it’s a thing that we can be proud of, but u can use it in 10000 different ways and every word has a different meaning depending on the context
I also find it beautiful, not harsh as a lot of people see it
And i like the fact that it’s considered as one of the most difficult  languages to learn, so it kinda adds a “charm” to it
We also don’t have gender articles, but we have to conjugate EVERYTHING (it sucks) : numbers, names, etc
Let’s take the basic russian name : Ivan - Иван.
Я дам Ивану - i will give to Ivan
Я взял у Ивана - i took something from Ivan
Его зовут Иван - his name is Ivan
Он воспользовался Иваном - he used Ivan
Он плохо отозвался об Иване - he said bar things concerning Ivan
As you see the simple name Иван (Ivan) is always conjugated depending on the context
The last letters always change, and we have this kind of thing also with numbers, cities
etc
Vladimir Mayakovsky wrote this:
“I would have learnt Russian just because of the fact

Very common, especially when texting, but in speech too
It's mostly used as a question or an affirmation (like in "We'll bang, ok
"; "Ok, I'll buy it then"), but sometimes as an adverb or an adjective meaning "normal", "well", "good" (like in "not very ok")
We usually spell it like ок (*ok*), but sometimes like oкей (*okej*)
In the literary language, о'кей (*o'kej*) is also used
The pronunciation is usually *okej*, but sometimes *ok*.
Horosho is way more common

I change the way i speak when in german and english
I actually put effort in order to say words, unlike in my mother tongue
I swear in English much more then in Russian, couse for me it's not sound like swearing
You pay a lot more attention to your words when you're speaking another language, like I always find myself thinking for a second before I say a single word to not mess up the grammar rules of German
Because the amount of ways to say "The" in German is really overwhelming :/
Definitely, it's even scientifically proven that a personality shift happens
I think I'm much more lighthearted when I speak Romance languages, while when I speak my native language I'm much more serious
Russian curse words sound a lot harsher, think that the huge amount of rap in English makes cursing feel more acceptable
Possibly Podgorica, capital of Montenegro
Looks like other cities of Montenegro have more entertainment than the capital

We have #1 medal at not knowing foreign language
Eve though we learn english since 2nd grade(as far as i know) noone cares about it and any knowledge they have is despite their attempts to not to learn it

Right know there's a common opinion that knowing at least English or Chinese is a must
But not much people actually master or learn them on daily basis
Exactly this
Same as basically everyone else, but I honestly can't imagine a situation where a guest that isn't "close enough" to me would dare to open the fridge themselves, haha

Kazakhstan/Azerbaijan : aslo fiercely loyal and always willing to back it
Finland/Norway: good poltical culture, seem like organized and efficient people
North Korea: n/a but i feel sorry for them
Poland: good cuisine and the right balance of western and slavic values

I think we should at least decriminalise it, because in Russia you can be jailed for 7 years for like 3 grams of cannabis

No, we should look in a long-term how countries that only recently legalized it do

As we know all strong addiction comes from marijuana
There isn’t any drug addict who didn’t started use cocaine/heroine

You can say that it’s not harm thousand times but I’m sure it is
At first you ingest it, after that you will hang on something stronger
Yes, the drug laws here are completely bogus
You can get hard jail time for a few grams, and people's lives are destroyed over stupid things like this

I didn't even hate non-Russian people, I just feared them
Of course this xenophobia died quickly within a few months after I grew older than the age of 4, but thinking back on it I was so stupid
I think it was because I grew up in the very northern most region of Siberia, where everyone I knew was the same skin colour as me
I'm just now looking at the actual map of Scandinavia and it's the same size of Alaska wtf
I think you can just pick 5 random capitals and you'll have something to look at in all of them
Lisbon - Côte d’Azur / Paris - London - Moscow(no bias) - Istanbul for me
but I would also say Barcelona, Copenhagen, Budapest
Amsterdam
Podgorica, Minsk, Chishinau, Skopje, can't think of another bland capital
Petersburg is more romantic, cultural, chill
I just prefer Moscow, the city is much more cosmopolitan
I was coming to mention Lavazza
I prefer crema e gusto for the rich taste but qualita oro is equally fantastic
I use a French peas to make it
I enjoy drip coffee too, but I'm too lazy to order a pack of filters online, and they never have filters in physical shops here
But after reading your comment I feel like I have to
Will order in a minute
I dated someone from the UK
It was the happiest five years of my life
I don't really want to talk about our private life, but she was special to me
And she still is
It was
strange, at first, because I don't consider the UK that far away from Russia (northern Europeans tend to have similar traits in my opinion), yet she seemed to consider me about as exotic as a Martian
She was just an easygoing person in general -- whereas I'm decidedly not
Extroverted where I'm quite insular
And definitely my gateway into understanding the UK and British culture
I would've done the same for Russia, but we never got around to it
My foster parents, bless them, accept me but they're still not very comfortable with my inclinations
I absolutely didn't enjoy meeting her parents because I made loads of missteps
I stood there like an idiot for a few minutes at the front door waiting for them to tell me where to go; I took my shoes off as leaving them on here is a no-no; I gave my honest opinion on something that was cooked when I asked for it (which her mother didn't like) etc
Those ones didn't.
Not very creepy in a terms of mysteries but there's a number of semi-abandoned fields in Omsk region and around North-Western Siberia where people buried a cattle infected with anthrax - cows, pigs and pangolins
It's one of these places where you will not want to walk or even approach
You can watch Alien: Covenant - it will be enough to understand what awaits you on these fields
а, в, и, к, о, с, у, я. Eight
Э may somehwat a word as well
But/and, in, and, to, about, from/with, near, I. Bonus: Hey
Я - I
А - something between 'and' and 'but'
В - in
И - and
К - to, towards
О - about
С - with
У - at, nearby
The same but we use *iz* instead of *z*.
Same (except "from" is "s" if its from a surface and "iz" if it's from the inside of something)
Also б may be used like shortened бы
Relevant meme [ (yep, these in the middle are legit sentences)
Let's not forget that English is actually three languages pretending to be one
Many Russians say "вышел с дома", "пришел со школы", etc
, especially in the South (where their language has some Ukrainian features)
But school teachers say it's "bad grammar".
It's like that in most other Slavic languages as well, or something similar
Yeah, I know, it's a well-known joke
Most languages in the world have been influenced by other
Russian had аз too once but now it's an ancient/obsolete word which you see mostly in quotes
Like мне отмщенье и аз воздам from Bible
That's because Old Bulgarian and Church Slavonic were closely related, almost same language at some point
And Russian was highly influenced by Church Slavonic
I once redacted some Bulgarian subtitles to a Russian movie (making them into Russian subtitles for learners)
And at first Bulgarian seemed unintelligible but after two hours I suddenly noticed that I understand a lot but feel like I'm reading text in some strange old Russian
I guess, it must be easier for a Russian person (with some exposure to old texts) to learn Bulgarian than vice versa though, because modern Bulgarian has lots of words old Russian had too but modern Russian lost many words that were similar to Bulgarian once
Yeah, it's interesting how vocative was exactly the case that Russian lost with time while keeping all others
And Bulgarian is so close lexically but grammar changed so much
If I'm not wrong, Bulgarian is the only Slavic language that has articles
Russian has lost the old vocative, but relatively recently gained the new vocative, though it has a very limited use, I mean name forms like Вань, Маш, Лёш, Вов etc
Yes, I would say
Most people are very reluctant to talk about their income or the value of expensive purchases such as cars or homes
Or how much they pay on loans
As for me, I always found this silly especially between colleagues
Next to my workplace, I always hang out a payment receipt issued to me
There wrote my month salary, my year salary and total taxes I paid
I didn't stole this money so nothing to hide
But when I talk to relatives of friends from provinces where people get much less than me for me it's always awkward
And I'm trying to downplay my income
These people get 10-15k rubles when I get 40-50k for the same job
In Russia it's not and people tend to share this info in first hours of acquaintance
It's rude to show off and bragging if you make more than someone
If you colleagues and know each other not by one day
I mean it's good to exchange this information more benefits then loss
This is kinda unreasonable because it's better to know your market value and know that you under/overpaid than not knowing anything at all
But it's my mercantile point of view
Are you located in Moscow, since here it's a common thing to openly share it especially as I found within middle asian community working there
Yep, not far from Default city
Even though your politics are a shit show, it is refreshing to see a post soviet state with relatively fair and free elections
Hopefully we follow suit in Russia
Generally yes, but that also depends on how protective your parents are
My grandparents didn't let me leave the neighbourhood on my own (let's say 1km in any direction from home) until I was about 10, but most of my classmates and friends would take public transport or walk wherever needed by themselves, and it was never a problem
I mean, our cities are pretty walkable, public transport functioning, and the environment relatively safe (shit might happen, but you don't expect it to happen because it usually doesn't)
This isn't exclusively a Polish thing
It's the same in Russian (and in Czech, as far as I know)
I often see other Russians use "adequate" instead of "sensible", "reasonable" or "sane" because that's what "адекватный" means in Russian
There are many more, but this one grabs my attention the most
edit: how could I forget about this one
Using "news" and "money" as plural nouns since they're plural in Russian
And in Russian
Damn dude how does one even end up knowing how to explain all of that in English lol
I am a rather fluent English speaker and I have no idea what “transitive verb” or “reflexive pronoun” mean
Also, is an average Ukrainian fluent in Russian
> There are many more
Oh, yes
- "to be agree" instead of "to agree"
- "on the street" instead of "in the street"
- "to drive/ride on a car/bus/train" instead of "to go by car/bus/train"
- "say/tell", "do/make", "hand/arm" and "leg/foot" confusion
- "tell/call/help to someone", because they all take dative in Russian, like "talk"
- "give to me the book"
I don’t understand it
Can someone explain what sound you guys are talking about
Or are you talking about spelling errors and not about pronunciation
Do they moor their jakht at the kway
> Couldn't convince him that knight wasn't pronounced knait (now I wonder why he didn't also claim it'd be knaigt)
I know this guy as well
There are dozens of other languages besides Russian which don’t use the verb to be the way English does so I have no idea what you are talk about about
I actually don't see this one, although it's something beginning learners of English would struggle with
> "on the street" instead of "in the street"
Actually, both ways are acceptable
Brits prefer "in" and Americans "on". Not sure about any regional differences in those two or other English speaking countries
That's because he has a wrrridiculouse French accente
I was on vacation in Germany and tried to use my German to order lunch in a café inside Leipzig Hbf
The waitress took my order, answering my questions in German, until she finally said "Thank you, I'll be back with your drinks shortly" in Russian and left before I could react
It’s a fun dance

We have an internal passport [yes a passport]
You are required to have a domestic passport with your personal data and a photo of yourself once you turn 14
It's the only form of ID that is accepted "officially" (like when you register a bank account, apply for a government service or whatever)
Russian passports are also accepted in a few countries like Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, etc
If you're travelling to any other country, you need to get an international passport
Unlike many ID cards, it has no record of your height or eye colour, but has a marriage stamp, a permanent residence stamp and stamps for your travel passports
Thanks
Too lazy
Also your army records
Moscow, Moscow, Moscow, St
Petersburg, Moscow
no surprises here
Probably: Moscow, Moscow, St
Petersburg, St
Petersburg, Moscow
Moscow, founded in 1147, became a capital of Rus' much later due to absence of unified Russia until 15-16 centuries and after defeating Tver' in this status
Petersburg was founded in 1703 by Peter the Great and soon became a capital, in 1800 it had about 330k people while Moscow had 270k. In 1900, these numbers grew to over a million, but St
Petersburg still was bigger
After revolution, Moscow became a capital again
Soon it became the biggest city again
During Putin terms, Moscow absorbed some cities nearby, and right now it has well over 10 million people, easily a record for Europe
I actually expected St Pete to have overtaken Moscow by 1800
Well, the difference was actually about 30k in 1800, according to wiki
And in 1810, St
Petersburg was already the largest by far

I've been to Oulu twice for some workshops and academic exchanges
It's a quiet little city, and it was in March, so I was excited to take some photos of aurora borealis
But unfortunately, the whole time I was there, there wasn't a single clear night
Not weird
Just a wasted opportunity, that's all
Can you tell Estonians and Russians apart
On my trip to Estonia, I was told that I should speak Russian to Russians and English to Estonians and that I should be able to distinguish them by their looks
You know what, all of them looked broadly European and could equally be Russian or not Russian
I've got not clue how I was supposed to differentiate between them
Lol
I see what you mean
I wouldn't say the majority of women dress like that here, but definitely many of them
Except the Orthodox cross, which I don't think many people ever wear
Thanks for enlightening me
Same in Russia: не делай из мухи слона
Same in Russia
We have the Institute of Russian Language
It doesn't ensure the stability of the language though
On the contrary it tries to keep all the rules as up to date with the "real" spoken and written Russian as possible
It is also the institution that keeps track of all the new words and chooses the word of the year thing
Sometimes these guys even suggest major updates for the rules, mostly for making them easier, but those amendments to the textbooks usually aren't passed
Also, we have gramota
ru website, where it's possible to see whether you use the word correctly :) There are even the forums where philologists can answer your questions about the language :)

USSR unified the language, destroying every single dialect
>In The Netherlands almost every village/town has its own dialect of Dutch
You are a piece of plain the size of Moscow oblast', HOW
Well we actually have a barely visible example
You can hear the difference between Moscow and St
Petersburg speech some letters aren't pronounced like it should be and the use of words can vary
Also we have the mix-ups of South languages with Russian which adepts you can easily find in European part of Russia
Kind of
Most people had to move to some obscure region after graduating university in Moscow or central Russia, so that already would homogenise the language
Teachers had to relocate too, so at school people with regional dialects would be punished for speaking improperly
And of course radio and TV were Moscow dialect only
>So, all of this is a lie
He probably means how it is in real life, nowadays it's hard to find people speaking in a particular dialect, unless one looks for older people in some villages I guess
There are some stereotypical differences in pronunciation of certain letters in Southern Russia, but even those differences are disappearing in the younger generation
Russians have a very prescriptivist attitude towards the Russian language, ideas on what is the correct version of Russian are quite set by now
Yes, though these regions never had time to develop dialects in the first place
>we have dialects that some of us can't even understand
~~we call that byelorussian and ukrainian~~
Those should be separate languages at this point, shouldn't they
Macedonia is pretty mountainous tho, and mountains are good at protecting languages and dialects (and cultures too btw) from being assimilated - just look at the Caucuses
A fuck ton of languages and even more ethnicities
I remember watching a documentary about an Old Believer village in the Tuva Republic and even in their case they barely have something that could be really called a different dialect
Those people shouldn't have been affected by 20th century population movements
Also no TV or Internet to even out the differences
Obviously most of Russian leaders weren't ethnic Russians: all Russian emperors since Catherine the Second were German and Danish, Lenin was Chuvash, Stalin was Georgian, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Chernenko, Gorbachev - Ukrainian, Andropov - Jewish, Putin - Finnish
Only Yeltsin and Medvedev were 100% Russian
>Putin - Finnish
Are you
TBH, most of my post is a meme)
Well, we have Astronomy as a subject for some time
We have history of art in Russia and drawing in Russia - drawing on 1-6 years and history in 9-11 years of studying
We do have something like slyod here
It is called труд (labor)
We were taught how to use tools by making small crafts
In my school we made wooden racecars and small hammers
AFAIK, only two such places for a really long border: [Ivangorod] on Estonian border, divided by Narva river and [Chertkovo] on Ukrainian border, with border roughly along the railway tracks
There's also the other, Russian, Donetsk, which is across the border from Izvarino
Well, as Russian I do experience it often
Especially with world war II
Most Americans care for the west front only, forgetting that the east front was even more important
And here the American part is diminished too
It's basically not true, but politics and propaganda do it's a job
Not sure about the European side of things
I think both were equally important
You just tried to take the land we took back
I can't blame you for that
But let's be real, you tried being sneaky with the peace terms
Until we told you to do it properly or the deal was off, you made no attempt to attack the retreating Germans until Tornio
Oh, my friend, you just mentioned the thing that has been provoking vigorous debates in Russian historical science since the 18th century
To start with, I would bring some context real quick
So in the 18th century Russian science was on a rise, especially because there were a lot of German, Dutch and Italian scientists invited here by Peter the Great
And there was one german historian, Miller, who was ordered to research Russian Primary Chronicle
And it says that  slavs from Novgorod and some other tribes invited Rurik "to rule them" form the overseas
Having calculated 2+2, Miller concluded that they invited a viking prince from the other shore of Baltics (most agree on "swedish", but I don't know if it was sweden back in 862 already or not, so I wouldn't dare to call it so yet)
Everything would have been great, but at the time Miller researched it, in Russia memories from the Great Northern war with Sweden were really fresh and, you know, his opinion wasn't popular
There was a prominent Russian scientist (though not exactly a historian), Michael Lomonosov, who debated Miller and brought arguments against his position
Lomonosov was a great scientist, but in this debate his main argument was equal to "I don't like swedes, so let's find other theories"
And that "finding" process is continuing today
This is called "Norman question" in Russian historiography
Anti-normanists (who support Lomonosov) usually bring arguments which are quite easily destroyed by Normanists (who don't support Lomonosov) but the debate continues today
Most historians, though, support the Norman theory and agree that Rurik was Swedish (or Scandinavian at least)
Some say that he was the same person with Rorik of Jutland
That, on the other hand, was a very useful debate for Russian historiography because it made historians discover many facts about our history while searching for arguments both for and against
Yeah, you are right
But I think educated people - no matter where they are from, knows and remembers history
I do remember pacific because I have studied history
You are welcome
>  but it gets better with the younger generation
I have some bad news
The youngest generations are the most stalinist generations around
Is that a thing
Well the European part of Russia was invaded, my grandparents fought, and my town has multi-thousands of casualties
(pretty small town), and I remember it just for this fact alone
I'm not angry at the German nation (some stupid people still do), it's just a history, but it touched personally a lot of people here

Well we have one which can be translated "Our cossacks ride across Berlin".

Never got around to play any CK game tho

I had plans for few months of vacation in Asia this summer after graduation, which I could use to work on my photography gig, try something creative like science video essays, and look for a place to settle in the future
Luckily, the AirBnb apartment I bought in Bangkok got refunded, so I didn't lose anything
Now my thesis defence got postponed too, so it seems like I will spend most of the summer at home in Moscow

How about a millistate
3 orders of magnitude should suffice for that difference I'd imagine
Not exactly, Russia is just a state
It's the smaller countries like Germany and France are decistates and even smaller ones like Netherlands are centistates
That is by the area and taking Luxembourg as a millistate
I admire Iran's bravery in fighting the biggest military power on Earth that killed more people in recent history than any other country
Few would dare to stand against US without nukes
To be fair, the embassy "attack" happened after the US murdered more than 10 Iraqi soldiers
Edit: typo
Russia
I was expecting Russia to be a popular answer and I wasn't disappointed
In our case, probably China
In the future, I could imagine them looking at Siberia and being tempted by the wide open space and natural resources there
The US isn't going to invade -- it's just not worth it to them
Hard to imagine
I don't think it will be European nation though
They have money and don't have guns - why would they do that
But Asian nations, for example, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India - they might be interested in our territories and resources because of their environmental problems, overpopulation, and being too far away from Europe
Can't imagine anyone invading Russia, that would be suicidal
I'd assume that it's the US, and that the WW3 has just begun
Belarus sure looking shady
Liechtenstein
I will give unusual answer:Turkey
Because of Syria who knows what can happen,because we support the side who opposes Turkey and we have ultimately conflicting interests in some areas and sharing the border there,last time our jet was downed we had sanctions and threats on our TV,furthermore there is Armenia and if Azerbaijan and them will have a conflict then it means that Turkey will join which means there is a possibility of clashes between us and turkish soldiers
Switzerland
I think civil war or riots are more likely to happen than invasion at this point
My Russia or your Russia
Thousand Years Of Beautiful Tradition :)
"Russians are the best villains since Nazis". Just wondering how this is not getting old

Are you sure you're proud of that
Standing at the border, breathing heavily and jerking off looking at Lithuania
Oh yeah
You're the sweetest piece of cake
Who would refuse
Invading Russia would definitely be a suicidal act, maybe not just for the invading country but for the whole world as well
Egh
you're on thin ice

I'm juggling with arm grenades right now
Why's that
Because we can fight back
Dude, the are the worst

Why would he do that
He and his oligarch friends make too much money robbing the state companies of the profits
Ooh, might read that

Who said I was proud of it
That's what you said last time
We all know what happened then
How Germany invaded USSR
Joke
Austria
Hey, you could join us in the old Russo-Danish tradition of screwing over the Swedes)
Oh yeah, how could I forget something that happening in front of my own eyes
Thank you for this reminder
I was talking about our "theatrical character", our friquent representation in media and movies, the popular opinion about us
We're playing villains since the cold war, for over 70 years now
Imagine that
Being hated for 70 years
Always outcasts
Not saying this is something we shouldn't blame our politicians for
It is
But damn that's interesting how Germans escaped this stigma after starting two outstandingly horrible wars in a row
How Italians are clean and fresh after the black shirts
How Japan is super cool after what they did to Chinese people
But we're preserving this trademark no matter what
And this is something I'm wondering about
>I wasn't disappointed
You
We're free with our sexual preferences, right
Most important Lithuania is over 18yo
I think France more experienced in that shit
Those are legitimate representation of our daily life indeed
To be fair, we have a great history of being invaded too
Dude, I'm on this comment section for a whole day and the word "invasion" is appearing in every single answer I'm getting
Come on
Not the ugliest proposal ever
Some common sense in it even
Like what
Do explain to me how it would help Putin's position selling the richest part of the entire federation to a country which still hasn't forgiven us for our part in the Euro colonialist conquests of Chinese territory
One of Putin's policy planks is nationalism
It's not gonna go over well explaining why we sold Siberia to the Chinese
And Putin always makes decisions without a long term strategy -- it's nothing new
That doesn't necessarily mean I'm proud of it
It means I had an expectation and it was fulfilled
Touché.
One happy peaceful boy attacking another happy peaceful boy
It's not "going", nobody is going to invade Russia
It's about "what if". And ok, maybe Afghanisntan is least likely in comparison to other central-Asian nations

Don't worry
No going up and down the coast burning cities this time

I thought it was pretty obvious but apparently not
- *sad face* •
You're just arguing semantics
Keeping the current pace we're never getting too far, so no worries about the combination you described
It was, don't sweat it
Someone just wanted to doebatsya
Sorry, I *disappointed* you
And btw it was obvious but sounded strange ^((to me))
Obviously you can do whatever you like
However this is nothing more than childish game of pointing fingers
Over and over we hear those "not in Russia though" and "true but not for Russians". I know you're hating the whole concept of this country
But can you try, just for a change, not extrapolate the whole concept on every random Russian you're communicating with
Thank you
Essentially we told the Baltics, "Hey, you need protection and workers
We'll give 'em to you
" Naturally they replied: "Nah thanks, we're good
" Then we replied: "No really, you need protection and our workforce
Let them in now or there'll be problems
So they did, then we overthrew their parliaments; ran fake elections that returned massive majorities in favor of joining the Union and annexed them
Even today all three have problems with their Russian minorities who don't cooperate very well
I'll be more careful in future)
Is there a bar mleczny named Krowa
No, rzywa is hard to understand
Rye cow
Neighing cow
Live cow
Or is there some kind of complicated pun with the sound of a blood-cow
Not really my own
But I know a Ukrainian folk song that's catchy as hell, it's "Хай живе вiльна Украïна"
The only one of my own I can think of right now is "Сумецкая" by Отава Ё
In Russian, it's "Шпаргалка" (Shpargalka)
As far as I know, it doesn't have any other meaning
Although, another way to say it is "Шпора" (Shpora), which also means a spur
Same here
Also "shpora", which is short for "shpargalka".
No lockers for books
We have lockers for our upper clothes and shoes, which we change when entering schools (they get dirty in winter or autumn or spring because of the snow outside, so it is unacceptable to wear them inside)
But how do you do your homework without the books
Isn't that, like, the same in effect
Let's say you have a biology class today
This means you get homework so you have to take the textbook home and bring it back
If you didn't have a locker you would take the textbook to school and bring it back
Same number of trips
We got homework every day
Russia usually uses the short system (that is, 10 in 12th power is trillion, not billion), with an exception being 10 in 9th power called milliard instead of billion — I don't know why
Almost the same as in English
million -> миллион (*million*)
billion -> миллиард (*milliard*)
trillion -> триллион (*trillion*)
quadrillion -> квадриллион (*kvadrillion*)
Moscow supposedly has a [second metro system] used for military and strategic purposes
Supposedly it's connected to an "underground city" that can keep up to 15000 people in case of an emergency
Its existence isn't confirmed officially, so you can't go there
Conspiracy theorists love the Metro-2
Besides that, there are a number of smaller tunnel networks that are proven to exist, including former strategic facilities and underground rivers that were enclosed in a system of tubes (Moscow has a lot of them)
You can even hire a tour guide to walk you through some of them
My friend has done it
Ofc it exists

Maybe something else, but i'm too lazy to think

* Official streams of esports tournaments are not a proper platform for political statements
The player should be punished somehow
* The punishment of the player is, frankly, disproportionate
The only reason I can see for such a harsh punishment is appeasing China
Cannot imagine such a reaction to a different political statement
* Casters being fired for that is ridiculous
Overall, not enough for me to boycott Blizzard, but they've handled it poorly
While I agree, that e-sport should not be a platform for political statements, what Blizzard did was, IMO, an overkill
"There is a person - there is a problem
There is no person - there is no problem" - is not the right way to do damage control
So, fuck them
If you've been playing overwatch instead of TF2 uninstall yourself
That's why they were so harsh in their reaction
The guy put them in a bind and they wanted to dissuade any future attempts like this one
It looks like a "no political agenda of any kind on our platform or else", which is entirely within their rights and, money-wise, distancing from any political statement is the most reasonable course of action for them imo
Has nothing to do with the flair, it's a pretty basic principle for professional sport
I don't think the rule prohibiting political messages has been abandoned by the IOC since then
Czechia, because its borders follow natural borders
Island nations are filthy cheaters
it reaches north pole
Please do
Look how neat New Guinea looks with its straight meridional border
I'm surprised people here are surprised by Turkey's action and Western "non-action". Turkey together with other its NATO and gulf allies has been destabilizing Syria for the last 7 years with one clear purpose: to destroy Syria as a country
So the current invasion is just a logical continuation of that: now there is no one to stop Turkey from de facto annexing yet another piece of land, like they did in Cyprus some years ago
If Russia and the US are allowed to invade other countries, why Turkey isn't?
So what other countries did in 2014 when Russia started the war in Donbass or in 2003 when the US and its allies invaded Iraq
The problem is that there are no universal rules to prevent wars
A person who makes the decision to start a war should be tried in an international tribunal with no exceptions, maybe this can bring more peace into the world
edit:grammar
Tell that to Americans, Brits and French
Yes, it's absolutely possible most of the time
On several occasions, I've identified native Russian speakers based on their intonation, even though I couldn't spot any non-native traits in their pronunciation or grammar or word choice (that doesn't mean there weren't any, though)
What the hell is perfect English pronunciation anyway
English/Scottish/Irish accent is as noticeable to me as an Italian or Russian (with latter ones I actually have better chances of understanding what's being said amusingly)
Even American accents, more subtle (NY, midwest) or less subtle (bible belt) are very distinct
Of course, some work on and fewer succeed in completely eradicating their accent, however, I think by that point they should be considered on the equal terms with native speakers
If I understand correctly that shining means excellent, this translation would actually work in Russian
Does using "fewer" with countable nouns sound pretentious to native speakers
No, we throw away our skates or glue our flippers together
Or play a game of crate
And people who swallow dust are losers
Our culture is mostly based on survivalism
Most history was a hungry blood bath for us with 20 century at its peak
Now we can live in very harsh conditions and think everybody is an enemy
Wash times, damn
Why can't you have washing machines inside your apartments already, could you please remind
This is ridiculous, right
Yeah poles are very simmilar
Can't think of a single one
We're really diverse, but for every unusual region I can think of another one that's kinda similar
Okay, let it be Kalmykija
I guess it's true for capital cities in most countries
Take Paris, Moscow, Vienna, Prague, etc
Not sure if flattered or offended haha
But I guess we are somewhat distinct in some ways
Dagestan exists and has more in common with Chechnya than, say, Tambov
Chechnya is the most obvious choice
Russia is homophobic in general and especially in the montane republics, one wouldn't want to come out in Dagestan either
That guy was an outlier
Overall we are pretty lowkey (or at least I thought so)
It's 100% regular Russia
> Slavic
I would've expected the second language to be Hungarian
From the UK: [Jason Mraz]
From Russia: [Monetochka]
Can the entirety of Russia ba classified as a weird/bizarre government agency
Also, probably the RosGuard
That’s our riot police/gendarmerie
Ukrainian is awesome
Our anthem uses the same instrumental as the USSR anthem, and while I'm not a super patriot I do like opera so it's okay
Do you guys get apples
Four or five
Maybe six when they are in season
Multiple greens , reds , yellows
Some are big , some are small, all varies with variety of apple
But we have a lot of types of em
I think it’s like 5-6 types
Depends on the season and the store
Mine usually has 3-6
Kinda similar here
It’s usually sour “seasonal” green/red apples, sour Granny Smith and sweet Golden
A chinaware set from East Germany that has never been used because no occasion is special enough
The set is usually kleinbürgerlich as fuck, with gilding and pastoral miniatures on every cup
We don't call sweet peppers Bulgarian peppers in Russia for nothing
You really love them, don't you
>this thing over the kitchen sink (no idea how to call it, it's for wet dishes to dry easily)
we have that thing too, i think it's pretty common here
Every country in the world does that
Except Denmark itself, probably
In Russian we call it "Pshikalka" , "Pshik" is the sound, and "alka" defines it as an object
People around the world can sometimes have strange things in common, it's beautiful
In Russian самоход is kinda obsolete 19-centurish word for every mechanism that moves on its own, heh
Most will imagine some giant robot or hybride tank probably
Why not racija
Minibeasts sounds like a line of plastic toys they try to peddle with an X-TREME sounding ad during a break in a kids' programme
In Russian it's "fireshooting weapon"
We do have a neutral gender
So we randomly attribute one of *three* genders to every word and not two like you do
Btw, in Latin it worked like this too
What gender the word will have mostly depends on endings (ends on -a - must be feminine etc) and general paradigma + tradition
A lot of English textbooks teach kids to use the word "keen
" That's something my grandpa would say
Books also usually teach the BrEnglish word for AmEnglish "drug stores" as being "chemist's," while that's true, a lot of people really do just say "pharmacy" nowadays
I think it flies in America too
Then there's reported speech, which I'm not sure many natives would ever use properly
E.g. You meet an old friend in the street and he says "I'm working as a teacher now
" When you get home to your mother you tell her what happened - "I met Soandso and he said he was working as a teacher
" *My* reaction on hearing that would be "Oh
What happened
Did he get fired
Finally, of course, outdated idioms; "it's raining cats and dogs" is so old that my tour guide in North Korea even used it
I must apologise, though, because past perfect is something we actually *do* use
My advice on articles for speakers of Slavic languages is just not to bother
Embrace the Tarzan speech and just rid yourselves of the stress
Funnily we have it too but most people don't realise it
They just use it unconsciously but don't realise that it's a thing
Just some variations sound better and some sound completely strange
Exactly the same, большой красный мяч (big red ball) is perfectly okay and красный большой мяч (red big ball) is strange and gives away a foreigner
Some characteristics are switchable and some create weirdness if you switch them
Really
I'd always thought we just have some words, generally for organisations, where the correct auxiliary verb is ambiguous
But this is totally a case of me "feeling it out
E.g. "the police is investigating" obviously feels wrong
But "Apple is developing"/"Apple are developing;" totally ambiguous to me
The government is incompetent/the government are incompetent
again I want "is
Fuck, maybe you're right
Germans and Russians both do this because *how* is the correct word in their respective languages
I wonder if English is actually the strange one here
I mean "say" is a verb
so "how you say something" arguably has logic behind it
Though I guess that, to us English, "how you say something" is more about tone/delivery rather than the content
I can't stop myself from using clauses within any sentence I write
E.g. "I helped my uncle, Jack, off the horse
Feels necessary in that one, though ;)
What about those retards who say "Legos," amirite
What native English speakers would ever do that
Did is also often mixed up with "made
" In Russian, at least, it's the same word
I think they're into you ;)
> "I met Soandso and he said he was working as a teacher
" My reaction on hearing that would be "Oh
What happened
Did he get fired
If he did get fired, should I have said "I met Soandso and he said he had been working as a teacher
" in proper reported speech
It ticks me off that "have" has confusing homonyms
whoever designed our language deserves a slap
Whenever I use any complicated tenses in my speech there's always one student who mistakes a "had" in it for a possessive of some kind
Or the opposite kind of situation can happen
And it's *really* difficult to explain the difference
Anyone ever hear this one
James, while John had had "Had," had had "Had Had," "Had Had" had had a better effect on the teacher
You're supposed to pose it to people without punctuation or capital letters as a sort of brain teaser
the idea is that two students were given two different essay topics
I speak Russian but have never learned punctuation
the comma use just seems random to me
What I really dislike is when Russians will write me in English on WhatsApp and start their messages with "Dear, BenedickCabbagepatch
Why on Earth would the comma be after "dear" and not my name
Screw the poor, but tenderly
The general rules of separating direct address from the rest of the sentence with a comma are, I believe, the same both in Russian and English
So even in Russian, it is wrong to put a comma after an adjective in that particular case
No, not at all
I remember actual fights in our Duma
Getting busy with it
Oh, I've just remembered the godawful word for having sex, which some of my elderly relatives use
СЕКСОВАТЬСЯ.
Ugh, the cringe
I think there’s a polandball comic strip hidden somewhere in here
Something something “makings of sex” and a couple of potato jokes
Extremely common in sweet pastries
It was my grandmother who told me about them as a source of drugs when I was about 15
I think we only have yellow press for tabloids, but nothing for literary genres
Well, we call noir noir, but literally "nuar"  not "ćornaja".
We had something similar, but I don't remember how we called it
I would certainly change the Frebruary revolution
It happened in 1917 and its result was abolishing the monarchy and establishing a republic
While some might say that it sounds good, it brought a lot of instability and eventually opened a door for the Bolsheviks to seize power, then the Civil war started because of that and, finally, the USSR was established, which is not a nice thing
Alternatively, the Russian empire was not the most cruel state and its industry was rapidly developing by the year 1913 so it would have been very possible that if it had survived the war, it would have continued that development
Finally, if the communists in Russia had not started those massive repressions and aggression towards other countries, as well as if they had not been supporting communists all over the world, then, maybe the NSDAP wouldn't have gained that much support in Germany because one of the main reasons for their victory, alongside the revanchist sentiment of the population was the fact that the nazis positioned themselves as anti-communist and many voted for them, for they feared getting their own version of the USSR
You did have a major impact on Barbarossa
You ensured it started later in the year, and so ensured that winter came before they could complete all their objectives
It's called the Time of Troubles in English
Translation of the Russian term for the time
Taming wild expanses
Cossacks
Not the ones from the Dnieper (which contemporary Russians called Circassians), but the ones from the Don
The Tsars kept splitting off new hosts off them, sending them as armed colonists to the frontiers of the empire
They weren't loners as stereotyped cowboys were, though
Do Poles have cossack stories
There are plenty of those in Russia, but Poland controlled cossack lands as well, so i wonder if there is a cossack archtype in Polish literature
Yeah, cossacks lived in big organized communities but were otherwise quite similar to cowboys (stereotypically religious, socially conservative, freedom-loving frontiersmen with horses and guns)
It was a conference where the sides decided what the future of Europe would be
Of course, Stalin was insisting in expanding his sphere of influence on a lion's share of countries that were liberated from Germany, but who else wouldn't in his position
I am glad that not every country in Europe became socialist, though
Well, in Russia government states that conference as a moment of glory and somewhat we’re should be proud of
The fact it happened in Russian land is seen as a significant demonstration of power
Also this is one of the reasons why Russian government (aged 65+ KGB officers) wanted to return Crimea and decided to use their chance in 2014
Well, it is mentioned in history books as prelude to the Cold war
I doubt people outside of history nerds know anything about the event or have any attitude towards it
Tried that, doesn't work, any other tips
But wouldn't family planning and birth control even further lower our birth rates
You know our population is declining already, right
(Russia) Vodka, and it tastes like sharpies to me, it smells really good, but it burns when it goes down my throat
It's easy to learn the basics of English and start using simple sentences from the very beginning
It wouldn't be so easy if you tried learning a highly inflected language (such as most Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages)
If you aim at a near-native level of fluency, then it's gonna be hard as fuck but not harder than many other languages
Some English speakers (or speakers of any other popular language for that matter) like to think that their language is superior because there are so many idioms and ways to say the same thing
Those who say that have obviously never learned any other language
Otherwise they would know that English is no special in this regard
English dictionaries may contain more words than dictionaries of other languages, but does an average native speaker really know those 500000 words, or at least 50000
Besides that, what counts as a separate word
Which words make it into a dictionary and which don't? The last question is relevant to linguistically prescriptivist societies (such as Russia) where slang and informal words are often considered inappropriate to be in a dictionary
English is a nightmare
All the conjunctions and slang is just overwhelming
Also it's annoying how it's not technically correct to start a sentence with 'And' but I don't really acknowledge or care
> On another note, I believe these weird dick-measuring contests over whose language is harder are stupid and pointless
There are no more complex or simple languages in terms of expressiveness
If a language lacks grammatical cases, it makes use of prepositions and word order
If it doesn't have tenses, it may rely on adverbs and aspectual distinction etc
I have to admit that make use of it every now and then
It is easier to start learning it for a European, but it doesn't make its structure or expressiveness more complex or simple
We Europeans take many "simple" things in English for granted
When many (or even most
) Asian languages don't have verb tenses, plural numbers, rigid word order, etc
Imperial units
Baseball and american football
Yeah, in Russia people would just get a shot of vodka and carry on
AFAIK metric system is official in UK
What system do you use in daily life
What's the difference between ethnicity and race
Some names for Russian cities are different in English
For example, St
Petersburg is actually Sankt-Peterburg (so basically it was anglicised in English), Moscow is Moskva
But most cities are actually called the same
There are probably more cases when English and Russian names of foreign cities are different, and similarly to Russian cities, it mostly affects big famous cities: Rome = Rim (read "reem"), Paris = Parizh (read as French pronunciation but with "zh" in the end), New Orleans = Novyy Orlean (word for "new" was translated into Russian), Beijing = Pekin (AFAIR this city used to be called Peking in English and many other languages, but then English spelling of Chinese words changed or something)
Beijing - Pekin
Pyongyang -Phen’yan
Rome - Rim
Paris - Parizh
It's Pekin in Russian as well
Shots fired
We have Yandex
Maps that also serve as a public transport journey planner in most Russian cities
In my experience, they tend to be more detailed than google in Russia
They are part of Yandex, which started as a search engine (I don't know anyone who uses it nowadays) but now has all sorts of services like Yandex
Delivery, Yandex
Taxi, Yandex
Music, etc
These are usually grouped under the umbrella term of Yandex
Shit (Яндекс.Хуйня) because there are so many of them
Everyone I know uses Google
We also have Yandex, Mail@ru and Rambler, but I haven't seen them used as search engines for years
I use Yandex on mobile because of Alisa
On my opinion, it is the best voice assistant
That's why I have only one browser and therefore the search engine
Also, I must admin that the searching movies in yandex is some next level
I actually use it too, but that's the only way I can think of
Fair enough, should probably try it
1 RUB - nothing
10 RUB - mediocre ice cream
100 RUB - 1 litre of Juice / 2 Twix/ 1 bottle of milk/ 2 metro or bus tickets
I would say this is a very bad ice cream
Not safe for health haha
We learned cursive
A useless skill
In Russia cursive is popular but only in Russian language we call it text written by hand/handwritten "от руки или рукописный" because it's in default means cursive
This is like unspoken standard dunno any notation to law but people mostly from preschool learn how to write cursively aka just chain characters in the words
I stopped doing this at 9th grade and did mix-ups of printed-like and cursive
Funny fact
While study of nation language we actively in the writing of cursive like texts
On English lessons we are do printed one because westerners don't give a shit so do teachers are
I guess it will die out at some point as it has in the English speaking countries in the past century
My younger brother hasn't been taught cursive (he's in year 5 iirc)
I don't quite get it when learners of Russian get so hung up on the cursive and how Russians claim that it's an absolutely necessary skill to survive in Russia etc
Havent you seen memes about Russian cursive
Idk why, mb keeping traditions
But this one is stupid
But this thing is useless
If by Че это (what is it) you meant Почему (why), then Im explaining: first, it's usually easier to write printed-like letters and they're more understandable, second there's no cursive on computers so we're still getting use to normal style
Easier to write in print
What
I can't write in print fast, i always switch to cursive even if i don't want to
bc you're used to
Everyone should be used to here, it's the only way you can write in school
If you first get used to printing, then you'll be fine in school
At higher school I was fine writing printed-like letters
Oh, yes, I remember some tourists from Iceland paying an insane amount of money for a taxi during the World Cup
I wonder why they didn't put a warning about unlicensed taxis in the fan guide
Most people here haven never tried octopus, but the idea doesn't get me freaked out
I mean, we eat shrimp and squid, mussels are widely available too, so I guess octopus isn't that much different
I don't eat it very often because fresh octopus is hard to find in Moscow, but I like it
Camions
Like big trucks
Voronezh - should be bombed at any occasion
Omsk - there is no way out
Once you're there, you die
Moscow - sucks blood of the whole Russia
Peterburg - hipsters
Caucauses - sheepfuckers
Chelyabinsk - tough simpletons
Siberia - tough bear fighting snowmans
Sevastopol - more nationalistic than normal Russians
Omsk is our meme city in Russia
Like the Omsk bird, old meme, people say the city is weird
Personally don't know much
Do not try to leave Omsk
The Moscow's unofficial name is Not-Stretchable bc there are bunches of immigrant there
If you want to talk about subtleties of Russian literature of the 19th century find a homeless in Saint-Petersburg and buy him vodka
&#x200B;
Chelyabinsk men are so harsh so they do not drink coffee
They eat it from jars
Chelyabinsk porn is so harsh so it's been forbidden in Germany
Chelyabinsk Satanists are so harsh so Satan is afraid to come to them
And so on
Yes, definitely
It's a developed country, has great career opportunities for me as a physicist, I'm allowed to have a family there
In addition, I already know the language, I have reasonable awareness of the US culture, and the US is quite friendly towards immigrants overall, so dealing with emigration to the US should be easier than with most countries
I don't rule out the possibility that I might move to the US at some point in my life, though I have some other countries higher on my list for various reasons
My wife and I would both like to move to New Hampshire, as part of the Free State Project, but there's no foreseeable way we could pull that off
I'm a great admirer of the US Constitution, unlike most I understand the purpose of the Electoral College and, though the US has a crapton of problems (many of which stem from government interference) with its healthcare and the like, I'm generally of the opinion that it's not unreasonable to ask people to assume responsibility for their own issues
I'm also of the opinion that the fundamental basis for citizens to possess arms is to have a forceful recourse against the government should the time come
The above might make me unpopular with other Europeans but, hey, at least we each get respective continents to if idolise
However, as much as I might admire the principles behind the US and its political system, I have to admit that I find actual American people pretty irritating: faux friendliness, this "wholesome" shit, their *obsession* with race and sectarianism, divisive politics
As opposed to my own country and the majority of other countries on the planet
There are currently only 28 countries where same-sex marriages are legal
>Not all states allow that, as far as I know
Since the 2015 ruling of the Supreme Court, all states
>I'm curious, don't you feel attracted to other European countries where you could have one too and be probably closer to your relatives
Yes, I would prefer moving to some European countries, like Germany or Sweden
I'm just saying that the US wouldn't be a bad option for me
What I understand, not only that close
But just friends also discuss that, at least I heard it numerous times, I'm male
My country’s? Don’t know
For me it’s pizza or burgers
Meat dumplings (pelmeny) with sour cream (smetana) is ultimate food
Absolutely love it
Germany - Germania (but citizens is Niemtsy)(nemoi = mute)
Sweden - Schwetzia
Denmark - Dahneeya
Netherlands - Gollandia (old)
Hungary - Viengria
Georgia - Groozia
China - Kitay
Japan - Japonia
UK can be mentioned as Anglia
Belarus - currently being specified
"Krievija" comes from the tribes of Krivichs
I've read that even a century ago some old people from remote villages in that area called themselves "Krivs" and they didn't know that they lived in "Russia".
Give this man an ice cream
And an award
Two
Hellas sounds cooler than Greece
It's also Gruzia in Russian
I guess they call themselves Sakartveli or something like that
The words "Hungary", "Vengria" (and similar words) and "Ugric" (as in "Finno-Ugric languages") have the same origin
A lot, because "plain" or "strait" titles are taken ages ago so you go creative for not infringe into existing and or differentiate yours
Sometimes it looks cool, sometimes idiotic
We have a "depressive bar" called "Угрюмочная". Рюмка is a shot glass, and угрюмый means sullen, morose
Рюмочная is a place that serves рюмки.
I don't know why, but in Russia the image of national poetry is tied to a certain poet rather than to a literary work
That poet is, of course, Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) widely regarded as the father of modern Russian literary language style and romanticist poetry
He also wrote many prosaic texts, was the first major author who would turn to Russian folklore as to a source of inspiration and he also studied history and popularised many of its parts (it is thanks to his enthusiasm and effort that we remember about the infamous Pugachev rebellion, which Catherine II had ordered to be erased from Russian history)
That is not everything that he did, but we are more focused on literary works here, so those of you who are interested can search for more information about his biography on the Internet
Pushkin's legacy is really vast and can't be described as something of a single major poem
What they do usually name his main work, however, is "Eugene Onegin", which tells a story of a Russian byronic-type aristocrat and his love, friendship, personal tragedy
The poem contains a lot of scenes that laconically describe the lifestyle and social environment of a highborn person in Russia at that time, as well as contain quite colourful images of Russian rural and urban life, nature and tempers
That all is yet not mentioning a beautiful and heartbreaking story of the protagonist, which makes you feel a lot
The Tale of Igor's Host is old enough to be Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian national poem
For something strictly Russian, there's Eugene Onegin, which isn't an epic, but is a novel-sized poem from the early 19th century
I would have said that one of the most appreciated and impactful poems is Requiem by Anna Akhmatova:
*Но я предупреждаю вас,*
*Что я живу в последний раз.*
I actually agree with you partly
I mean, I love Akhmatova's works, really
But Pushkin is kind of too monumental for the Russian literature
Too many poets were inspired by him or saw him as an authority if you know what I mean
Actually I really like Austro-Hungarian cuisine
Big fan of spaetzle, it's one of the tastiest things ever and I don't know why it's not more popular
Weinerschnitzel
Paprikash and goulasz
Bryndzove halusky
Karadjordjeva snicla
Cevapi
Really underrated imo
>we don't try to drown the actual taste of the food with unnecessary spices to hide the taste of rot and decay
You don't use much spice but you certainly put a lot of salt
I'm not a big meat-and-potatoes sort of guy
I'd prefer some spicy curries with coconut milk and goat or lamb over some meat-and-potatoes dish
Yeah Spanish-style paella is overrated
Latin American countries often have distinct version of paella that are way spicier and more flavorful
Yeah, why pay 20 euros for some meat-and-potato dish, when in Southeastern Europe you can get a delicious pljeskavica or cevapcici for just a couple of euros
And I find those countries to have tolerable cuisines, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be
Stuff like potato dumplings, spaetzle, bigos, pierogies, they're very tasty
In Russian it’s the same as in English, without Germanic
You can use Wikipedia to check out international namings btw:
Svatá říše Římská národa Německého
Which is word for word translated  to:
Holy Empire Roman of the Nation German
Grammatically correct
Holy Roman Empire of the German nation
The Russian Wikipedia page also lists "Священная Римская империя германской нации" ("the Holy Roman Empire of the Germanic nation") as one of its names, but I've never heard anyone call it that in my life ever
There was a big movement 200 years ago, led by Alexander Shishkov
Mostly remembered because of the funny word "mokrostupy" for galoshes, "wet-steppers".
There is a certain sentiment in the government and among the population, but it doesn't clearly prevail
And the gov
itself doesn't make effort to replace loanwords
I imagine all his presentations of the new language principles were aborted by the audience unable to stop snickering at mokrostupy
We just call them galoši
So relatable
Same in Russian: "izolirovatj".
If something is "actual" in a normal language, it's often "relevant" in English
Lol people who voting for putin are incomparably dumb
Oh, we have such guys as well
They uses selfmade USSR documents and cause long argues with "illegitimate" police officers, don't pay bills and taxes etc
Well, World War I lost us the empire and had most of the ethnicities in it gain statehood for themselves
Which isn't in my opinion a bad thing
World War II, well, only when the government wants an excuse to take land from our neighbors
There's a narrative that Russia's imperialism has always been about safety for the heartland, and while that may have been ONE of the concerns; it was definitely not the only reason
This is a pretty good breakdown of it:
Japan still wants to get back some if not all of the Kuril Islands and because of it we still haven’t formally signed a peace treaty
We got a fancy seat in UNSC as a major victor of WWII which also influences our foreign relations
I'm russian and many older people still find germans our enemies (they even call them nazis)
Yes, still very huge
Mostly the after-effects of WWII tbh
The "liberation" of our neighboring countries made them very skeptical of us, and it impacts our foreign relations a lot to this very day
Some Russians still think that all Germans are bad nation
Im new to the sub, but guys
Do you have that thread every fucking week discussing WW2
Russian teens love Germany more than Russia
I'd blame the Britons for abandoning you when the Germans were attacking for that personally
Throughout my entire life, I've never met a single elderly person, including WWII veterans, who thought in a such way
Every family has a veteran of this war
I know many elder people and nobody said such bullshit
The main opinion is completely opposite - they fought not against Germans they fought against Fascism
Said an American whose nation only earned money from that -\_-
Have you ever seen Odnoklassniki
Actually no, after the 2017 massive anti-soviet propaganda started here
Some teens really believe KGB killed everyone who they see
Is it sarcasm
Yeah
British officer: "Oof, it's getting a bit sticky here
Let's just withdraw on both the Portuguese flanks without actually telling them we're pulling back
It'll be fine
Can You elaborate more
I don't think 'Odnoklassniki' represents the majority
I don't think most of the elderly people know about 'Odnoklassniki' either
Odnoklassniki is a trash bin
It was America's decision to participate in the war
I mean, of course it's good that they decided to participate, but there's nothing they should hate Germany for
Why
True, but many use it seriously
I'm sure that "хочу сказать этому ебаному абэмэ нахуй" was completely serious too
Oh, sorry for misunderstanding
Yes, communism memes really popular now
Yes, something like this
That's nice :)
Those дегенераты usually stick a sticker "можем повторить" to their cars
They're just stupid and don't count
Why
Because any country consists of stupid people
Sorry guys, Im not good at history then :)
I only knew about the US nuked two towns in Japan, so I used to consider the US as an agressor
Да считаются они, таких много (у меня в селе каждая 6 машина такая, или со стикером с танками)
Сейчас people не любят их, дегенераты сами understand и реже клеят this sticker
Guess they don't really know what is communism and never read communist literature
My biggest cultural conflict with the Americans on this site is over (what I view to be) faux positivity and general insincerity
Approaching these in order, what I mean is:
-Faux positivity; when they post what seem to be really forced memes, pictures or stories that desperately try to push through a positive narrative but seem somewhat removed from reality (e.g. "This brave pupper guarding our airport
" or anything from /r/WholesomeMemes [the whole sub feels totally forced and contrived to me
] My apologies for not explaining this very well, but I'm a person who very much values sincerity and straightforwardness and I find myself feeling fundamentally suspicious of people who effect faux positivity
-General insincerity; this is definitely fed by the upvote culture of Reddit, but suffice to say that it seems a great chunk of what they write (especially when pursuing humour) is for the purpose of pandering
On a more sinister side though, there's something present on this site that's also seen to an extent in my culture
and that's feigned empathy/expressions of concern (likely in the name of virtue signalling); the whole "sending you hugs
" or "Hey Redditors, how're you feeling today
Removed from the above, also somewhat annoying (but understandable) is all the pop culture references
You see an interesting post and scroll down to the comments to look for discussion or further information but you get some in-jokes and then random quotations from American TV series or films
E.g. "TIL Beavers won't chew on the sunny side of trees
"DAMN IT MARK
"Rachel that's not a toaster
"This is why we can't enjoy our Wednesdays
Or something like that
And I'm just led bewildered and rapidly scrolling down trying to find something I can relate to
Edit: One area of personal experience I can apply what I perceive to be an American idea of "false wholesomeness" to would be my brief experiences with seeing a cognitive behavioural therapist; he led in our first session saying I need to understand and tell myself that everyone is born with equal value; that we all have talents and skills that ultimately level us all out as being equally capable in our own ways
I just found that to be what I'd call a platitude and it seems like a lot of Americans live by those; they repeat some mantra or phrase ad nauseum to motivate themselves (take a look at /r/motivation) and delude/lie about the nature of reality
I'm pretty on top of my issues but I'm somewhat proud of the fact that I reasoned myself as far as I got and didn't have to rely on crutches or self-deception
which I view as fundamentally dishonest and I just can't go along with (largely because my feeling that I'm aware of their *being* deceptions makes me unable to be fooled by them)
But I may well be overly cynical
For the record, I'm British but I moved to Russia and, though I have a lot of conflicts with the mentality here, I generally fit in much better here with the general "mood" of people than I did back home
As much as I love the American Constitution and the philosophical basis of their country, I think I'd really clash with the people themselves if I ever lived there
I feel culturally isolated even here
This is a problem
A lot of American Redditors perceived themselves as generally well-informed or having a sound perspective on life as a whole and yet when they articulate what they consider to be pressing issues they seem to fail to understand that the phenomena they describe (e.g. systemic racism) is generally largely an American problem (or at least their understanding of it is) and their experiences, critique and proposed solutions don't apply to the rest of the world
Yet they'll soapbox as if these are the pressing issues of our time for the world as a whole
Wow, you described what I felt, but couldn't put to words
I felt like in many subs people too often try to "sell" you something
They make a post, and include YOUR intended reaction in the title
" You shlould blah blah", "This is an awesome blah blah that I blah blah". And in the comments it is most likely just repeating the same thing over and over again, without adding any substance
Belgians taught me that mayonnaise on chips are the bomb
I'm bored of all the posts about anti-vaxxers and flat earthers
Even on the internet, I've never encountered advocates of either and find the posts to just be wasting space
Because Edirne is in continental Europe
I guess
I mean, that's not a problem
Despite being in Europe we are hugely different from most of it
I'm here due to curiosity
I'm from the UK but live in Russia (haven't figured out how to change my flair to show that :P)
I'm sure we've some "rar rar" idiots back home who buy into that bull but I associate with few people as it is, let alone bored middle class 4x4-driving mothers, lol
Moscow: just a very, very big city
Petersburg: seems like a more loved city by Russians & foreigners than Moscow
Omsk: nobody escapes Omsk, N/A
Astrakhan: I hate it, because of so many jokes about it on AskARussian, please stop
Norilsk: one of the coldest places on the planet from those where many people live
There's a pasta about it above on comments
Very few of our older folks have anything good to say about the Imperial era - though I suspect that's because the last Tsar was completely incompetent more than any real opposition to the regime in general
A lot of them miss the USSR for one reason or another though
Because almost everyone who didn't support the new regime was completely wiped out
Agree
True

Oh dear, off you go
There are some recognizable ethnic names, but that Ajdar Ajupov can be a Tatar from Tambov or Vladivostok
There's one curious case, though: someone with a very traditional combination of peasantish ethnic Russian names is just as likely to be a Jakut as a Russian
>a very traditional combination of peasantish ethnic Russian names is just as likely to be a Jakut as a Russian
Probably *more* likely to be a Yakut
Old-timey-sounding names like Fedot, Gavriil, Afanasij, etc
, seem pretty common among modern Yakuts while having almost completely fallen out of use among ethnic Russians
I know St Januarius is the patron saint of Naples, so Gennaro is like Spiro on Corfu
I was born in Armenia, Echmiadzin
Beautiful place by the way
But I was almost toddler when I moved to Russia
I don’t really want to live in Armenia at all but I want to visit it again
I was there about five years ago and it’s tough to be far from my homeland
Yeah, you’re right
Good choice for tourists definitely

He said "Me eats bread".
So relatable
We made our bases too
Luckily, I lived on the edge of the town, and we had a vast forest right next to the neighbourhood
That's amazing, wanna construct one now
I don't think we do anything to honor victims of ww1
I agree, also people don't learn much about WWI in schools
Idk why, probably because Russia lost
Or the originals
We always called it by short name
In Russian Czechia is a normal way to refer to that country, so I just find this name much more convenient and familiar than Czech Republic
Honestly, most Russians are surprised when they learn that Czech Republic is more often called like that in English
My answer is basically the same as u/bartenderdude94
I've always called it that (Чехия) anyway
In Russian we already called it Chekhija (Чехия), so I'm fine with the shortening
I'm not sure, however, how to pronounce it properly in English, so I just say Che(k)hia (Чехиа)
same here, we say "Чехия", but never "Чешская республика"
I don't get what are you talking about
I just transcribe й as j instead of y, bc then you're mashing 2 very different sounds in one symbol, and I doubt if someone who doesn't know Russian would be able to tell where is which
You can only use "-ija" ("-ия") in Russian
I pronounced "Czechia" with -ia only because it's like that in English (and, well, i was talking about how I pronounced it in English)
Ah, no, there are no such words I can think of
Pretty sure even fictional names get transcribed with -ия
The red one
Love the simplicity
Well we had the same flag
The only reason that thte flag of the czech republic looks the way it looks is because Poland declared first as their flag
I personally think that we have a better flag because of that
Yeah
With the sickle and hammer
Flags with 3 stripes are unoriginal
Absolutely the same here
Similar to us: "revnostnyj" vs "revnivyj" (or "revnosten" vs "revniv" when the short form is used)
The map you've linked it VERY outdated
Even the generations of our grandparents (I'm 21) don't speak with most of those regional features anymore except a few odd ones
Of course, there still exist some regional differences, but they are really nothing in comparison to, for example, English dialects currently spoken *within* England
As to your comment in a different thread, Russian is a very prescriptivist language where people absolutely love to establish a "correct" form for every situation in accordance with the literary norm, so you'll find a lot of people arguing about what is proper and what isn't. Especially stress patterns, being the most variable and ever changing part of the language, suffer the most from this
Stress patterns change slightly depending on the region, but I believe there's more variation between individuals than between regions
There are several exclusive words for each regions, but that's it
Pronunciation really doesn't differ as if it was referred as a dialect
But there is one thing in Russia called a Russian North - Arkhangelsk region
It's populated with folks who preserved or at least tried to preserve their tradition, old Russian language since Oprichnina of Ivan the Terrible, since serfdom law and even partially since soviet rule
I really had a hard time understanding elder people's speech
Though it definitely was Russian
One of my [favourite videos] showcasing a dialect
Yes, some sounds are pronounced differently, but I have zero problems understanding him
You have to look for the oldest women in the most remote villages to find a dialect broad enough to be incomprehensible to an outsider
Bro aren’t “Irish” and Gaelic, like, the same thing
Gaelic can refer to either Scottish or Irish, which are closely related Celtic languages
Scots is a Germanic language closely related to English
Well, his speech is peppered with paramilitary slang and swearing like a Thai dish, but I understand him just fine
Gaelic my balls lmao
Standardized school education, standardized language in state media, massive forced and voluntary relocations of the people
Try totalitarianism, use new ideology to wipe out all traditions in order to build a default soviet citizen and force new language standards
Also to achieve better results deport as many citizens as you can to the distant lands and vice versa
Not really strict language programs in every village, but regional variations were heavily marginalised and considered uneducated and incorrect
We still have a lot of freaks obsessed with "speaking properly" and annoying the hell out of other people just going about their daily life
There's this person called Tatiana Gartman who has earned herself fame by mocking politicians and media people for making "mistakes" in their speech and calling them lazy idiots who can't be bothered to look into the dictionary ([link] to her YouTube channel)
At the same time, she has been repeatedly heard making *the same* mistakes she "exposes". Her excuse
"It was a hard day, I was really exhausted by 10pm" etc
Many of her explanations are incorrect and anti-science, which has been shown by a few actual linguists
Yet her popularity isn't going anywhere anytime soon

The most outrageous example I can think of: during the 2018 World Cup, the local Burger King offered 3 million rubles and lifetime supply of burgers to Russian women who would get pregnant from professional football players
They deleted the post and apologized the same day
I have no idea how anyone from their marketing team could think it was appropriate
They always use edgy and borderline inappropriate ads, but that was something else
All I remember from last year was a male friend I made in the UK [sending me this] with a winking emoji
(I'd format it but I don't know how on my phone
Edit: Got onto a laptop and did the formatting anyway
Yup, Burger King kept making trashy ads for quite a while
e.g. [this one] says "пшлнх мкднлдс", which literally translates to "gfy mcdnlds". [another one] warns you not to "обострись" - this word is a portmanteau of "обосрись" (to shit yourself) and "острый" (spicy)
>which literally translates to "gfy mcdnlds".
I'd translate it as "gfckrslf mcdnlds" to preserve the idea of stripping all vowels

Australia (by land area)
Russia is pretty small
Everyone thinks it's big, but I wish it was bigger
It's the smallest country that I still think of as big (that is, Australia is big, but everything smaller than Australia is not)
Seems like an Austrian already commented that :)
They're kinda medium-sized
Yeah
I mean I once said that New Zealand is small, and someone replied that New Zealand is quite big because it's about the size of Italy
My reaction: ???
They make up ~40% of all countries' land combined
Besides, I would label ~130 countries (out of ~200) as small
From lifestyle perspective it's definitely Moscow
It offers so much more than the rest of the country
From a tourist perspective I would pick Suzdal, a lovely little old town with a rustic atmosphere and well-preserved examples of early Russian architecture
And mead
Russian memes are entire world and they are absolutely different from English memes
I didn't know many English memes before visit Reddit but local memes were everywhere
The so-called "post-ironic" memes have exploded in popularity last year
They're often abstract and/or completely meaningless
It was good but than came post-irony and it's not even funny
So now I'm here
Not a single day but actually 2 days we went to Velikiy Novgorod
On the first day we had a tour around the Nobgorod Kremlin (IIRC it's the oldest Kremlin in Russia)
It's connected to the city by a cool 250 meter bridge and inside the Kremlin there are a lot of old buildings (now museum)
A church there has gates that were forged in Magdeburg in 1153 and they have bible scenes depicted on them
But the main thing is the Millennium of Russia monument
It's basically a giant bell with 3 rows which portray every important person in the history of Russia from 882 (I think it's when Rus was established bit I'm not sure) untill like 1800s when this monument was made
The most interesting thing is that the monument  was cast and it's really huge
Google it, very interesting
On the second day we just walked around the city and did a horror quest
Really cool stuff
Even though I written another thing I had that too
Our school runs an exchange stundent program with a Finnish school for pupils with good english
Part of our program was Fazer chocolate factory too
So cool
Oh cool in Russia we have a similar tradition
There's a holiday called "Масленица" (Maslenitsa) where we burn a giant doll that represents a spirit of winter ti scare winter away
After that we cook tons of pancakes
I guess we are all slavic bros/sisters after all
Parents at best, but usually friends and the Internet
People of school and the outside world but not the education system itself
Russia
We had an hour of sex ed instead of a biology lesson in one of the later grades (i.e., too late)
It amounted to "STDs bad, use condoms" and a few drawings of people's genitalia cut in half lengthwise
Before that it took me quite a long time to realize what sex even amounted to
I had a book for kids about health that had a chapter on sex and related topics, and it didn't bother explaining that in the most basic case you have to insert a penis into a vagina and slide it back and forth
No, it jumped straight to the dangers of masturbation and early pregnancy
Nationalists who choose to move to a different country are a peculiar sort
I could never take a Russian nationalist living in Canada seriously
After all, if you have consciously made a choice for your descendants to have no part in the ethnicity you supposedly hold so dear, what sort of nationalist are you really
Does your mother ever talk about moving back to Ukraine
If Peter I's childhood tutor and friend Nikita Zotov hadn't been chosen by his mother, he probably would have grown up to be much like his father; competent but not exactly welcoming toward outside influences -- keeping Russia in a state of backwardness
Zotov helped Peter organize games involving live ammunition and cannons at Preobrazhenskoe (which later gave it's name to the first of Peter's Guard regiments - the Preobrazhenskiy); ordered him globes of the planet; engravings of cities like Paris and London etc simply because he was good enough to notice Peter's inclinations
Ironically, Tsaritsa Natalia only chose him because of his knowledge of the Bible in Russian and Greek
Edit: I can't spell cannons evidently
Lol thats nice
What years is it
I want to read about that part
Ha, we have pretty same story)))
To be fair, Hitler thought we were weak anyway because of his racial ideology -- our shitty performance in the Winter War just reinforced it in his mind
Apart from the Mongols and in 1917, you mean
We probably do
I have an extremely small, almost negligible amount (2%)
The rest is Slavic
And hey, it's amazing what people will do for the lure of money
Yes and no
Yes, in that executing a good chunk made the rest (even the good ones) quite unwilling to show initiative, and instead stuck to the bad plan knocked up in a few days to avoid punishment
No, in that there were many who survived the purge and went off-piste when needed
Zhukov for example, was never afraid to tell Stalin what he actually thought
The guy who came up with the plan that finally broke through the Finns, Timoshenko was on the older side
but another one
Really, it was a mixture of bad leadership; non-acclimatized troops with none of the basic equipment needed to fight in the winter; the weather itself limited our attacks to sectors the Finns had already pre-identified (i.e. Raate Road); and the aforementioned extremely basic and bad plan
Our English textbook in primary school said that the future tense should be formed with "shall" in first person singular/plural, but the teacher told us it was the old-fashioned way pretty much right away, so it wasn't a problem
There were probably other things, but I don't remember them
Regarding "how do you do
", my grandparents were taught that phrase when they were in school, but we weren't, as far as I remember
Turns out real Germans can't themselves stack more than one dependent clause in a real sentence without bungling up the verb order
Like, "I found the man who cleaned the booth which we sat in yesterday" is not ended with "gesessen haben geputz hat gefunden" in actual spoken German
We were taught the same thing about "yes" and "no".
We were taught the same thing about English, and I found it weird, like why would I say my name to potential scammers or some other ill-wishers
We were taught that supper was outdated, but I've actually seen some native English speakers say "supper" to refer either to full dinner or or a light night snack
Must be regional then
I've actually heard people keep the "ne" even in casual YouTube videos
It's probably not the most common way to go, but let's say I've witnessed it more than 10 times in the last couple of months
All words like Peace and Love,
All sane affirmative speech,
Had been soiled, profaned, debased
To a horrid mechanical screech
> “Supper” (and about a dozen other words for meals between 12pm and 9pm) vary wildly based on region and vernacular in my experience
Not a single English textbook I've read ever mentioned that some people in England call it "tea".
Even "shall"? Like, for example, would you say "I shall go to the doctor tomorrow" instead of "will" or something
One of my guest professors from Oxbridge used to say in RP something like 'hasidoa'
He probably got it from British Poles
Really interesting, I thought it had pretty much fallen out of use except in instructions (like "one shall do X"), suggestions (like "shall we do X?"), or when you want to sound like Gandalf ("you shall not pass")
My dad went to the same university classes as a guy whose last name was just Filin (great horned owl, *bubo bubo*), and this guy's most commonly uttered phrase was obviously "I have a given name, you know
We have a city named after Saint Peter, a city which name literally derives from a word "Archangel", and also a city, the name of which means "Master of the East". Hell yeah I like our cities' names
On a more serious note, our cities' names are really quite nice and distinctive, and that is very convenient since Russia has many cities and towns
It is a beautiful mix of cultures and ages really
So, Софья? That's just an older variant of the same name
I reckon it's somewhere in Siberia, most likely in Taiga
It's not the only area that counts as "nowhere", but it's in the *middle* of nowhere
If it was separate country it could be the biggest country in the world
Well, you see
Jokes on you, my best friend's wife is from Kropyvnytsky
UPD: Although wait, she's not from there, she's a a Kievan alright, her father is
But I met him on the wedding, so I kinda know him
People from smaller towns are moving to the big cities, and especially to Moscow
I encountered "radioactive materials burial site" sign while walking in the forest around St
Petersburg
What's worse, I arrived to the sign from the *back* side, meaning that I just left the site
We have a triangle road sign (red edge white canvas) with a tank on it
And a caption "Warning: Tanks" sometimes with "sudden gunfire" warning or like that
It kinda fun when you see it on a picture, but kinda scaring if you see it through your windshield in the middle of nowhere
Like that:[
But that not Russia-specific and I didn't see where I live (but did see once ot twice)
We have a fancy sign where a scull and crossed bones depicted, with a striking bolt, and a warning "No climb or be killed"
Why is it better
If you left mine field, you're just okay
But of you left radioactive zone, who knows
It is quite popular in my hometown, but it's not really developed on a national level due to poor infrastructure (for rugby)  and lack of financing
However, since last couple of years, the popularity of the sport is slowly increasing
Eggs are sold not refrigerated, but we put them in the fridge at home
With milk, it depends on what milk you buy, but any is put in the fridge after opening
I think british people like warm milk, with a foam especially
In Russia the same
I think it seldom happens here, as people tend to finish all of the food they've ordered right in the restaurant
But it isn't a problem if you ask
I have a friend with quite unusual eating habits, and he does it all the time
I use two keyboard layouts: the standard US English QWERTY and the Russian ЙЦУКЕН. Basically the same as everyone else in Russia, I'm not original
Keyboards sold in Russia have labels for both layouts ([like that]
To clarify, pressing (usually) Shift + Alt will let you switch the layout quickly on Windows
I also don't look at the keyboard when I type, so using PCs in Germany and Austria was pure torture
I hate the tall Enter with a passion
That's where the backslash and the bar live, and I need both of them
Both combinations are fairly common in Russia, not sure which one is more prevalent
I personally use Alt+Shift, but if I use somebody else's computer, I usually try both
No, since they are two different alphabets
Greece
Greek and Roman cultures are very similar, and don't forget the Byzantine Empire
Constantinople definitely deserves the title of "Second Rome". Another interesting thing is that Moscow is called the "Third Rome", but it's only because Muscovy became the centre of Orthodoxy after 1453
So it's definitely Greece
>Germans knock on tables following a meeting
Oh, that's funny, we knock on the table (or something else wooden) three times as a superstition when telling about something bad that could happen (so it wouldn't happen)
Like "if we go to the forest and get lost there - knock, knock, knock - we do x then". Or, alternatively, you say something like "he is *that* stupid" and knock on the table to show how very stupid
We traditionally have two layers of curtains for that, for example
Closer to the window is тюль layer [ which is very light and allows sun in just fine but makes it hard to see what's inside, and second layer is some thick fabric for the dark time
Oh, I understand
Our people kinda feel uncomfortable, I guess, if the window is close to places where people walk and can look in, so most keep these light curtains drawn at all times
But if your window is on some high floor with no buildings around or in the middle of private garden, that's another situation
Though our noms' generation demands tiul' on any floor and any window, according to them a window without tiul' just doesn't look right, heh
Eh, it depends on what size of window is small and what is not, I guess
But yeah, they usually not the size of the wall for sure
I measured mine, as they are typical proportion for high-rise building, so window starts \~ 85cm from the floor level and \~50cm from the walls, something like 20-30cm from the ceiling it ends
On a big wall the window is bigger too, on the small smaller
I think, the main reason is the weather - walls keep the warmth inside much better than the windows
In Soviet time a technology of wind-cold-proof plastic windows didn't exist yet, so naturally in older buildings big windows meant cold rooms
Our typical models of dachas (wooden summer houses) usually have big verandas with wooden windows on \~80% of the wall - but those rooms are usable only in the summer as a result, you just can't keep them warm in the winter
This kind of windows I'm talking about [

We have bail, but it's optional and the investigator or the judge has to allow it
It's rare enough that no market niche has formed around it
I can't even find out whether skipping bail is a crime or not
I think the only punishment is that you'll be arrested if caught and your bail will be forfeit
Pastila from Belôv. Unlike modern factory pastila, which is homogenous and made with agar, this pastila is just Antonovka apple puree, powdered sugar and beaten egg whites baked into thin sweet and sour sponges which are then stuck together into sliceable loaves
Once, my SO offered to cook a soup traditional to a country of my choosing, so I randomly said "the Netherlands". Fast forward a few years, snert is now a staple of our home cooking, and literally no one I know besides us knows about it

- Church of the Ascension, Kolomenskoye (that's in Moscow)
- Ensemble of the Novodevichy Convent (that's in Moscow)
- Historic Centre of the City of Yaroslavl (a two-day trip)

What does "historically Ukrainian Kyiv Rus" mean
The Ukrainian identity started to emerge in the 17th century, while Kyivan Rus existed until the middle of the 13th century
The dynamics among the principalities (that included parts of modern Ukraine *and* Russia *and* Belarus) were completely different
Not that I have anything against the name
I think it’s perfect as it is
I actually thought about that
North Macedonia shouldn’t have taken Greece’s petty bullshit and tried to come up with a way around this issue
Just makes them look weak and controllable tbh

Never understood how multiple emphasis in a word works
I mean japanese have similar thing and for me it sound like thay have random accent
When using term from japanese (like Yakudza) we use whatever emphasis we want
Noreg for me sounded like nOreg without a hint of emphasis on E. Guess i need more vodka

Nina is a wonderful name
Good choice
Hate that name
I’m Anton and for some very odd reason almost all teachers used to call me Artyom every now and then instead of my actual name
Always thought it was strange as those names are not really that similar
No, we don't unfortunately
Gergians are pretty keen to use Greek names, just like Russians
Mainly because they're also ordodox Christians
So we kinda share those names because of the church
Examples: Mikhail, Alexander, Nina (Nino in Georgian), Sergey (Sergo in Georgian), Georgy, etc
Edit: spelling
I like Ukrainian version of usual Greek names
Whenever I hear Mycola or something of this kind I imagine dashing Cossacks galloping onward with sabers above their heads
Super badass
You will definitely see a lot of that in Russia, but the messages are usually more random like "I love summer" or whatever, they aren't about identity or ideology
Fairly common here in Russia, though I don't know how it compares to other brands
Probably because you have to pay less for them
I've noticed they tend to be cheaper, though I still avoid them like the plague
It's the size of a toilet, doesn't take up that much space

China
Russia is becoming their low-cost petrol station with a trade surplus, which is compensated by Chinese agricultural, industrial and electric goods which in turn weaken Russia's domestic production
They are quite unpredictable and expansive with soft power
USA threatens with economic sanctions because they must, but overall historically they are Russia's main strategic partners
Not sure about Mongolia
What do we know about them
North Korea, people forget we're right next to that cook
I wonder what country that guy’s talking about
You forgot Japan that has territorial claims on some Russian land and enough military power to press them
On the western front we are the bully, but the situation in the east is less in our favor
While I doubt anything will happen this decade, you never know what could happen
Japan has an increasingly powerful right-wing
Well, Berlin is on main tank route between Warsaw and Paris
Poland, Germany, Belarus and Russia all have that wide open plain
Do a double take and read what the weird letters spell out
Who else
Certainly not Russia
It’s a tiny country sandwiched together between Poland and Lithuania, after all
Yeah, this is pretty much the way I see it too
Japan gave up on Sakhalin, but I'm sure they would opportunistically grab some of the Kuril islands in case of Russian weakness
As for the Chinese, I don't think they'll openly become antagonistic with Russia to dominate the Far East, but once again, they most definitely can try to do something funny in case of severe problems in Russian center

I don’t think there is morality in geopolitics (apart from being a rhetorical tool to accuse an opponent), but that occupation doesn’t really improve your security and wastes a lot of resources
Practically the same here
We think we can punch upwards if we allocate more resources to our foreign policy, but we only manage to punch the new superpowers in the dick
Sooner or later this will have to end when our domestic infrastructure collapses
I said in “geopolitics”, not “politics”. Check up on the difference
> Putin recently lost some seats in Parliament to the communist party
Yes, it was a tactical vote, but it was the Moscow regional parliament, not the federal one
Not much, to be honest
Perhaps something about the Egyptian history and the fact that a lot of North Africa is Muslim and speaks varieties Arabic and also part of it speaks French due to the colonization
Also, Egypt and to a lesser extent Tunisia and Algeria are popular tourist destinations for Russians
To me, the Middle East and Central Asia are the closest non-European regions
I wouldn't say that I know a whole lot more about the Middle East than about North Africa, but Central Asia is very familiar to me as we have more shared history with them (they were part of the USSR) and a lot of immigrants from there
The reign of Boris Godunov and "Trouble" (is it how you name it in english
) would be awesome history period for assasin's creed game
Early 19th century St
Petersburg would be really interesting because of all the art there
The setting would be beautiful

You absolutely did
I recently got into the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars when I ran a Kickstarter to design English and Dutch model ships centred around the period and the latter were a real pleasure to build
Though they were still somewhat ornate, they were much more understated and, frankly, elegant than the ostentatious and gilded monstrosities the English were putting out
I guess the Dutch had the better Protestant sensibilities
For the Dutch I modelled Zeven Provincien, [Prins Willem (an Indiaman)] a [Man of War] and a [fluyt] (Fluyt is centre, Zeven Provincien is behind on the left)
For contrast, here are two British first rates
[Prince] and [Sovereign of the Seas]

I don’t think you can call it a Christmas/New Year thing in Russia
They would show it on tv but there is no tradition around watching it

I listen to stories from older cousins and maybe go watch a movie or play a video game with my little cousin when politics (or other boring topics) get brought up
I still sit at the little kid table

"Otrok" means "a child" in Russian too, but its archaic

Huh, so there is no such subject as 'Russian language' in Kazakh schools
Chechnia and we all know how that ended
Oh, no, I think we still don't know how that will eventually end))))
TBH I was always  wondering why did Russia supported Abkhazia and South Ossetia instead of Georgia
I think it was pure political decision
But why
Because of North Ossethia and other Caucasian republics
Out of interest, is your word for 'handgun' and 'revolver' the same
Because shotguns and rifles are two completely different types of weapon
Both "city" and "town" are "город (gorod)". AFAIK, this is the case in many languages,
A night dream and sleep
Both are сон.
"Hand" and "arm" are both "ruka" in Russian
Privacy and intimacy are both intimitate in Romanian
Apparently, "month" is etymologically related to "moon".
Back when semi-auto pistols were new, many Russians called them revolvers, because to them a pistol meant a muzzleloader
Yes, Romania
We say "mesyats" for month and "luna" for moon so there's no obvious connection between the two in Russian
I've just realised that we also use "mesyats" for a moon *crescent*. But the ordinary word for "moon" in general is "luna".
Nothing to do, lol
Ever heard of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity
I think we use "mesyats" and "polumesyats" more or less interchangeably
The latter sounds a bit more poetic
I certainly don't identify with my city or region
I do identify as a Russian, but that's more of a fact than an actual identity
I guess they do, some more than others
The strongest local identity can be found in Tuva and the Caucasus
I personally come from a region that has "always" been populated by Russians, so I never had this opposition between my region and the country of Russia in mind
We made tanks and age-of-sail-like ships out of wood and nails and then played with them
Yeah, we were fans of Pirates of Carribean
The biggest of these ships still rot on the dacha, they are 15 years old now
Russia has a lot of variations of outside kids games
(It is although possible that other countries have the same or similar variations) One of my favourite was tag but the "It" is always the same and when he touches you you need to stand like a star until someone slides between your legs and then you can run again
"It's" goal is to tag everybody
It was so fun you wouldn't even believe it
When we were older (say 10-11, maybe even 12-13) we played IRL DnD
We didn't know that there was such a thing so this was our imagination completely
We made quests, weapons from wood, even clan wars with some neighbourhoods
It was so epic
I wanted to pin point those games because I didn't just wanna answer with those generic "Play videogames, watch TV, football" of course I did it, but I think the OP asks us for the country specific things
I always want to say "condolences" like it's "condolescences", can't do anything about that
d/t + th: _width_, _breadth_
th + s: _months_, _depths_
Portugal, not quite sure why exactly
Though OP has the same answer, seems that Eastern Europe jokes are not 100% jokes, we do have something in common
>Kyiv seems similar to Barcelona,
I've been to Kyiv back in 2011 and found it being the copy of Moscow (or vice versa, Moscow is a copy of Kyiv, to please our Ukrainian fellas)
Ah I see
I heard that the US does not have "national" language at all, so Spanish is also as well American as English, and nobody cries about that
>  Imagine if Moscow was predominately German or English speaking
History knows that as well
There was a time when Russian nobility was all French speaking
Been there, very beautiful place

When antibiotics were discovered, Soviet medics have caused a mass mistreatment of infants, which lead to unprecedented number of hearing loss cases in a generation
It went unreported to the public, but increased number of special schools in 60s for deaf kids stood out
Mall fire in Kemerovo, that happened last year
It was a cascade of poor decisions (such as dismissing the alarm as false, because it malfunctioned in the past and locking the cinema hall) that resulted in a tragedy
64 people died (41 of them kids) and 79 injured
> on the other hand it was the same in the Cold War but there the bang never really happened
I don't like this line of thinking
It never "happened", but war almost broke out multiple times and people such as Vasili Arhipov had to disobey protocol and later be reprimanded for it in order to save the world
We have too much snow that snow removal service does not have time to clean it
But I live in Siberia so
Nevermind)
Just east of Moscow, like 5 cm of snow that appeared like 3 days ago, and they say even this will melt soon
Yes, snow cover is around 50 cm here in Urals
It only snowed in Noveember
We have surprisingly little snow this year in Nizhny Novgorod
I think there were less than 30 days of permanent snow so far, which is fairly unusual
And there is still not enough snow to prevent it from melting if the temperature goes above 0 again
As far as I remember, it has always been considered a scam by both young and elderly people

Most (but not all) of female rulers of Russia were foreign-born, and were not ethnic Russians
But those europeans kings, queens etc
ethnicity is hard to determine as tney were (and I think are) like one big monarchy family
Those females became a ruler after their husband Tsar or Imperor of Russia died
All the time
From rurik, to romanovs, to lenin, to stalin, to khruchev
Hу wasn't foreign-born
The country he ruled was USSR, and Georgia where he was born, was part of it
But "thank you" anyways :)

Everyone was celebrating new millenium during January 1, 2000
I think any of the lines from Alexander Blok’s short poem [“Night, street, lamp, drugstore”]
«Ночь, улица, фонарь, аптека,
Бессмысленный и тусклый свет.
Живи еще хоть четверть века —
Всё будет так. Исхода нет.»
———————————————
“Night, street, lamp, drugstore,
A dull and meaningless light
Go on and live another quarter century -
Nothing will change
There's no way out
Kinda nihilistic
We learned it at school and everyone was reciting it since then
One of my dad's favourite stories is how he helped two warrant officers who stood watch with him (or sat, since that was at the border guards HQ)
When he arrived they were trying to solve a crossword puzzle and were at the end of their collective wit
The hint was "Night, street, lamp, ...", they said they had come up with every single thing that could happen under or near a streetlamp at night, but none worked
When he said, "Drugstore
" and it obviously fit, they were floored
"Comrade captain, *why* would it be drugstore

That being said, I've never been in a bad conversation with a Scottish person, only very entertaining\good ones

Yes you’ll get a lot of angry noises from the Visegrad countries

Depends on what you mean by bread
In a broader sense, many other parts of the world have staple foods made of flour, e.g. Chinese steamed buns or various Indian flatbreads
This
I would not Iimit myself to the listed countries, though
You can find unique and delicious cheese in every European country
Actually, most varieties of cheese are very low in lactose and safe to eat for most lactose-intolerant people
Kefalotyri and Graviera are less popular, but great and deserve to be known much better than they are
I love lubelski cider
We get polish food as a standard in our shops
Besides their food is almost exactly same as ours
Greece I love their mythology and how depending on where you were born depended on what you would do it’s just so fascinating
I think that history of every country has much to tell and from time to time I become curious about history of a random country, but I like history of Russia most because I feel connected to it and for me it is not simply a knowledge, but also a part of my identity
If to talk about other countries, History of Greece is amazing
From Leonidas to Justinian, from Athens to Constantinople
Fascinating
If you don't mind my asking, why
To start, I'd recommend the biographies of Catherine and Peter by Massie (his scholarship on them is amazing and packed full of background details of the country during their reigns); and Sebag Montefiore's '*The Romanovs*' (which despite it's name actually starts with the reign of Ivan Grozny and the fallout from his dynasty's dying out
'*Natasha's Dance*' is
acceptable as a starter for Russian culture but I don't agree with the author's conclusions sometimes
I haven't yet, but it's on my list to read
What's your rating of it
They're literally called "Catherine the Great" and "Peter the Great" (by Robert Massie)
Maybe if you'd even done the most perfunctory of Google searches, you could have saved us both some time
>Catherine and Peter by Massie
FTFY
I think I can remember Russian and Soviet anthems, I also know first 2 lines of Ukrainian and Belarusian ones
Also just realized that I've never heard the Kazakh anthem before, and [it's very good imo]
>general mindset is if someone is rich he must’ve stolen/exploited someone
Yes
And everyone thinks that's OK, 'cause they will do the same, if they get a chance
Everyone here in Russia likes to flaunt the money they earn
I know guys who've sold their houses so they can afford a flashy car, and live in rented housing now
Like the Romanian guy said; people like to flex
I guess going from dreary mediocrity to suddenly having a good amount of cash to spend does that to you
And yes, I'm no exception to this in some ways
The most difficult accent to understand would be an accent of someone who doesn't use Russian as a primary language, e.g. someone from a village in the North Caucasus
But even then it's not really difficult to understand
Enforcement of the standard dialect in education and mass migrations all over the country
Some people still speak with some features of their traditional local accents, but those are far and between compared to 100 years ago, and many people don't have those features
In general, a random person wouldn't be able to pinpoint where someone's from depending on their accent, unlike the UK or Germany
Sometimes it's possible if the person has some very noticeable features of a particular area, but you need some luck finding such a person
Most of the time, those features are extremely subtle (since they were able to survive education by not being marked "wrong" by the teacher :D)
So only someone knowledgeable about phonetics and old dialects would be able to notice that
I don't think the concept of ethnically Russian is relevant these days
But more than 50% of the population have Slavic ancestry in most regions, if that's what you're talking about
The ethnic russians managed to do it in time when colonialism was still 'acceptable', to say the least (not that it makes it better or anything)
I'll refer you to the map of [the traditional Russian dialects] which encompasses a very small part in the West of Russia
Today these dialects are essentially gone due to the enforcement of the standard dialect
It has also happened in France and Poland to a large extent, as far as I know
All of those places used to have comparable linguistic diversity to Denmark
The same thing would happen in Denmark if according long-term policies were in place
I guess it is less irony, more projection
They also replaced 'the Russia is a multi ethnic state' to 'the russians are state forming ethnos' in constitution this summer
Sad stuff all around
I live 70 km east of Moscow
It usually snows November to March, but I honestly don't know what to expect after the last winter
I live in the southern Russia and we had no proper snow for the last 6 years
I lived in the North before and it was miserable
Wouldn't recommend 6 months of snow to anyone
Although people tell there is less snow lately
My country is big as hell
But specifically in my city (located in Western Siberia) we can see the snow from October to April
South-Western Siberia
Snow from middle of November to the end of March
April is typical spring month but one week heatwave can happens
Thousands separators other than a space are incredibly confusing and shouldn't be a part of people's lives in 21st century
Use whatever for your decimal separators, but the space is enough for thousands
I'd say it's the norm for young people, at least in my experience
Regarding older folks, it's not necessarily the norm, but it's not a big deal for most people
Most of them fall somewhere on the spectrum of "cultural" Orthodoxy, meaning they identify as Orthodox Christian "because they were baptised as a baby" or "because they live in a traditionally Orthodox country", but they don't follow any religious traditions
I'd say those who are real Christians (like really believe in a god, go to church, follow the teachings of the Babble, etc
) would receive more attention than atheists
The religious ones are the weird ones in here
Religion isn't a favourite subject for a debate
People in the czech republic more or less don't care about god too much
I only know 5 religious people and one of them is american so that doesn't count
Normally
It's definitely not the default stance, but it's not uncommon
Most people say they're orthodox christians, but the absolute majority doesn't follow any traditions and/or visits church only on Easter or something
You may have some problems is your family is religious, but I don't think that's widespread
I think Atheism, or at least non-practicing Christianity, is the norm in the UK
As an Atheist myself, though, I think it's concerning that nothing has replaced that belief
Christianity has its faults but at least its an ideology that pushes people to behave in a moral way and truly concern themselves with the welfare of others
I think that, if this corona crisis has shown anything, it's that while it's easy for people to profess a sense of benevolence toward others, there really is nothing compelling people to actually act in a conscientious way (as so many people breaking quarantine has shown)
I have issues with the fact that, ultimately, Christians arguably only behave decently because they're forcibly compelled by the threat of eternal damnation, but it seems like the most people don't have anything better to push them
Honestly, not a lot of people would care from a societal standpoint
Although the government does have laws that can indict you for “hurting the feelings of religious people”
He's a crab, or a gnome

maybe Japanese (a lot of memes I encounter have Japanese symbols, idk why) or Korean (one of my favourite YouTube channels is in Korean, some videos have subtitles while some don't)
Japanese - sounds awesome, useful
for things and travel to Japan
Italian - sounds awesome, less useful, but who cares, mamma mia is life
Spanish - sounds great, quite useful too, I want to read Gabito in original so much, it probably is awesome
You win
Отличный выбор (:
Yeah that "usefulness" was in my view for myself
I really don't like the sound of German and would like to avoid it if I could - and Spanish in my case could serve that role
I think most are still standing
From what I can tell, almost every town has Lenin statues standing, and I think they either should be removed completely or replaced by a statue of someone more relevant
My town has 2 of these: one in front of, what I think, was a factory entrance (now it's just 4 shops), and one on the main square (which is named Square of the Revolution lol)
The former is really ugly and should be just demolished, and the latter, while not ugly, is still irrelevant, and should be replaced by a statue to someone relevant, and the square renamed
Other cases should be decided individually
Most of them are standing, even purely communist propaganda ones (like Lenin's statues)
Big cities like Moscow and StPetersburg removed most of them and renamed many streets, but smaller towns didn't bother
By now i don't think many people are troubled by them - they are more known as landmarks, not for their meaning
As for other countries, i think Axis countries should keep them as punishment and the reminder, while countries like Baltics, Poland and Czechia can do whatever they want with them
Lenin first captured his country, killed all capitalism in Russia, shot the President and his entire family, came cattle, began to pinch the intelligent people: doctors, scientists, and so on
They took apartments from people who were successful with their minds and gave them to the proletarian
The collective farmers were easily deceived, they were stupid and illiterate, they believed in the idea of a prosperous country
The corrupt officials took over all the factories
They broke up the churches and drowned the priests
Then they added half of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and a lot of others
They set their own rules, arranged exile to Siberia
The consequences are colossal
Modern Russia is now against the Communists, this can clearly be seen from the history books and how the media present it
Real bandits came to power
Have you seen Stalin
He was jailed 5 times before the revolution for hooliganism and only 1 for political reasons
Because of this bandit in power, the Victims of Communist terror were ~11
1 million people
BUT There are many old patriots left
of course, there are Lenin monuments in every city, and I live on a street named "Karl Marx". Open any Soviet song and there will be hundreds of comments: "OH, THAT WAS OUR CHILDHOOD AS I WANT TO RETURN TO THE OLD SOVIET TIMES SO WELL LIVED
" People did not see anything around, there was a small selection of Soviet products on store shelves, many people lived closely and not alone in apartments
The country was closed
Everyone was against religion, but they worshipped Lenin
The country was ruled by corrupt officials, they could buy cars and apartments without queues and without problems, such a luxury an ordinary person could not afford
on the other hand, any ordinary worker could buy what he wanted in the store, before standing in line for 3 hours
There was free education, the best in the world by the way, objectively speaking, free universities, one of the best Sciences in the world, everyone could afford to go to a restaurant, to the cinema, pre-booking of course, because there were huge queues everywhere
As for the second world war, we can safely say that the USSR really defeated fascism, 41 million people from the USSR died
If not this country, Hitler would have captured at least the whole of Europe and most likely you would not be able to write this message here now
Objectively and incorruptibly speaking, the Soviet citizens suffered the most from the second world war, they showed Hitler where his place is and you can see this even by going to Wikipedia
How is Lenin not relevant to our history
Definitely should've said that differently
He's relevant, but relevant for the whole country, and not some village in Vologda oblast in particular
Imo, in towns we should put statues of someone who was important for this specific town, not the whole country
Nikolay I, he united the 5 villages into one town in 1844
They didn’t “lose” the Cold War
They agreed to democratize and dissolved
> will soon lose the new economic war again
I've been hearing that for 6 years already
Fat bait, 10/10
Well then we’ll install a huge statue in front of your capitol building
You guys are too inept to defeat the Ottomans yourselves so this will be a partial payment for our services
I went to a pub in Berlin around lunchtime, was almost the only customer there
Sat a couple of minutes and had no idea how stuff worked
in the end I walked over to the bar with the intention of asking if I should order there onl- "Go back to your table, we'll come to you to take your order
Oh, okay
A couple months later I found myself in Vienna with my best friend
We went to a pub and I told him we should stay put and wait for the barman to come to us
After an age, we finally did go to the bar and asked if we should order there "Of course
" "Oh right, sorry, I was just in Berlin recently and there we had to stay seated
" **"You are not in Berlin
**"
Lovely bunch, them Germans
What if the other chap is a twat and that's why the barman skipped him
We were taught about "continents" and "parts of the world". The continents are Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Australia and Antarctica
The parts of the world are the same except America is one part of the world and Europe & Asia are two parts of the world
I don't know if this is in line with the scientific consensus, if there is one
For Russia it is like this:
* Eurasia
* Africa
* North America
* South America
* Australia
* Antarctica
Yeah, I've also seen the same answers from Ukraine and Estonia
They still teach it that way, I graduated from high school just a few years ago
Not so good, lots of underground and overground crosswalks that were built in 00s and 10s. In Moscow things getting better and there coming more bike paths and but can’t tell for the rest of Russia
Moscow has quite many bike lanes, but they are poorly integrated with each other and the rest of the city
Motorists and pedestrians often disrespect them
I believe it's even worse in other cities (like in my hometown there isn't such a thing as a "bike lane" at all, neither is there in most other cities)
We have a nice bike renting scheme where you have stations all over the city and you can take a bike at one station and return it at any different one
It costs somewhere between 12-20€ for the whole season (1 April – 1 November)
Depending on the plan, you have to pay extra if you're using the same bike over 30/45/60 minutes (if you check it at a station and then take it again, you won't have to pay)
So it's pretty convenient
They also have electric bikes which are nice
But ordinary bikes are too heavy, which is a downside for me
Non existent in my city, decent in Moscow, at least in comparison
I'd say Moscow is good for fitness cycling, passable for utility cycling (the majority of the cyclists I see are food delivery couriers), terrible for commuting
Our commuting bike lanes are shoehorned into the existing road network and do not form a connected network of their own
We also get six month of brown slush every year
My teammate actually used to commute to work before the virus, but he did that only during the warmer half of the year and had to share the road with cars for a significant part of the route
From my mother's side: my mother, grandmother, uncle and his girlfriend
We are very conforming to one person's behaviour: we all used to pig out on large amounts of food until my mother started going to the gym and eating healthy
They used to drink alcohol until I became a "grown-up" teenager who was offered to drink but never did
Innocent conversations quickly slip into a not-so-polite debate club about politics, conspiracy theories and other bs
(I've had ENOUGH of this in the light of the current circumstances, lol)
By the end of the night, everyone agrees on some compromise
The food is always great, but, as I said above, everything is in moderation
From my father's side: my father, grandmother, aunt, step-brother, his other grandmother
Happily binge-eating on the innumerable number of dishes grandma has made and having mild conversations about how everyone is doing
Rinse and repeat, nothing remarkable (except the food)
"Косил косой косой косой" (cockeyed rabbit mowed with braid) this sentence can be used to distinguish who can speak russian and who use translator

When I was in Cuba, it was a group of Canadians who emerged as the main drunken arseholes of the hotel, with one jumping from the roof when he got high on God-knows-what
Meanwhile the Russians were all well-behaved
Really messed with me, considering the stereotypes
My Russian student came back from Denmark saying it was a paradise
Would you like me to get rid of him before he can tell anyone else
I do enjoy it hands down, but that has nothing to do with English specifically
I'd feel the same way about being able to speak any other language that isn't my native
Learning to speak another language and seeing your progress is a very rewarding experience
I genuinely enjoy linguistics, reading about languages, their structure and their history, and studying peculiarities of languages, so I enjoy both Russian and English
I think I like Russian more because my understanding of it is better
But I also feel like I write better in English than in Russian, simply because I have significantly more experience writing in English professionally
My Russian texts come out heavy and clumsy, and I don't like it
Perhaps I don't notice that my English texts are just as bad
I believe it's common to feel that your native language is more emotional than any of the languages you've learned later in life, which are often seen as more rational and concise, regardless of the language
There have been some studies about this, I can look up a link if you want
Though when it comes to translations, it will also depend on how the translator has done their job
It can be done in Russian, but you have to attach a verbal suffix, and it often doesn't sound as eloquent as in English, although there might be plenty of examples when it does
Yeah, French spelling is so consistent that *mars*, *août*, *os*, *fils*, *seconde*, *esque* and (at least) hundreds of other words
Oh, wait, do you know which rule dictates to pronounce those the way they are
Holy shit this video is so good
English language sounds kinda thin and dry whereas Russian sounds
thicker
There's been quite a lot of research into emotional distance from one's non-native language and related topics
For example, Keysar et al
(2012) examined how the language of communication affects risk based decision making and found that people tend to make more rational decisions in their L2 (non-native language) compared to L1 (native language), in which their decisions are affected by biases and emotions to a greater extent
The L1/L2 groups examined were English/Japanese, Korean/English, English/French, and English/Spanish
Another study by Costa A et al
(2014) resulted in similar findings with regards to moral dilemmas; the participants were English/Spanish, Korean/English, English/French, English/Hebrew, and Spanish/English bilinguals
A different work by Colbeck et al
(2012) compared how native English speakers and native Chinese, non-native English bilinguals perceived taboo words in English, and found that non-native speakers experienced less emotional triggers compared to native English speakers
And my favourite jam: Dewaele, Jean-Marc
(2011) discovered that highly proficient bilinguals and multilinguals tend to perceive their L1 as emotionally stronger and prefer it to their L2s to express emotions and participate in highly emotional interactions; the participants were of many different backgrounds and L1/L2(/L3
) combinations
All of those papers also contain references to the relevant literature as well if you're interested
That said, given the statistical nature of such investigations, they don't *prove* that attaining a native-like level of emotional engagement in one's L2 is impossible, but they do demonstrate that not having done so is normal and doesn't really depend on the particular languages involved

I'm not sure what you mean by English sentences being packed with information
Are you talking about various grammatical constructions like articles that are absent in Ukrainian and Russian
In this case, the distinction can often be inferred from context or clarified by using certain words or rephrasing the whole sentence altogether ("...жил *один/некий* мужичок", "... *тот* мужчина...", etc
At the same time, there are devices present in Ukrainian and Russian that English doesn't have, like the distinction between perfective and imperfective verbs ("делать" vs "сделать")
Again, in English, the difference is often irrelevant, can be inferred from context, or specified lexically
I don't think it's a problem
If you mean that there aren't so many ways to tweak an English sentence and make it quirkier, I tend to disagree with this
English is very well known for its wealth of synonyms expressing certain nuances and associations
It's just that as non-native speakers, we might not be aware of them because a lot of those are rarely used, similar to how non-native speakers of Russian generally wouldn't know expressions like "с придурью".
I do agree that the choices made by a translator have a huge impact on how we regard the resulting text, but that works in both directions, not only from English to Russian
"That never happened before, and here we go again"
"Better to be the head of a fly, than ass of an elephant"
"You should think, what you understand" and others from Russian politic Chernomyrdin
The Smolensk Kremlin
Built in the very beginning in the 17th century to protect Russian western borders from the looming war with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it js the longest fortress wall in Russia (though some parts of the wall have been destroyed through the centuries)
The fortress held the Polish army for 2 years from attacking Moscow
Actually, it even played its role during the Napoleonic invasion of 1812, though its construction that had gotten outdated by that time and therefore the Kremlin wasn't really important
Today it is one of the symbols of Smolensk
However, unfortunately, the authorities are more busy with embezzlement and other schemes today, so the Kremlin is in bad condition
I hope that someday they will at least try to maintain it
If not, then I am afraid for it
It’s a relatively new building, but it’s notable
I’m taking about the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg
It stands on the former site of the Ipatiev House, also known as the place where the Romanovs were executed
I'm from Vyborg
That's basically the name of the Swedish castle the city was built around
I think the castle was built in 1286 and it's logically a main attraction
I guess Czar Nick was late to the industrial party huh
Did they sell Poland out along with the Targowica nobles
Yes, of course
It happened during the war, but the wall didn't play any role in it, naturally
The era was different
It was not more than other architectural sights for the combatants, I guess
Plus, Napoleon destroyed most parts of the wall when he retreated from Smolensk in the end of 1812
What is left makes a good accomplishment for the city centre
P.S. what offensive could possibly be in your reply
it's nothing to worry about
Yeah
Well, I am telling about the fortress and it was also constructed for war
Everything is connected to war :D
Actually, it's quite true
Each time someone attacked Russia, they had to go through Smolensk to get to Moscow, so it is a miracle that the wall still stands
Well, it's either one depending on its size and purpose
Molot is more like a Mjolner-sized, big hammer
Molotok is your usual construction tool
I make 130,000 rubles ($1,700) in Moscow at 25
&#x200B;
Realistically, I should be saving around 25-33% of that if I rented a room in one of the outer neighbourhoods, did not party too much and was rational with my spending
&#x200B;
However, I live 20 minute walk from the Kremlin, party a lot, Russian girls don't pay for themselves and have takeaway every day so I save very little (maybe 10-15k a month)
&#x200B;
One of my goals is to become more financially responsible - aim is to start seriously dating and settle down
Trying to save 400-500 euros per month
Sometimes I wonder why didn’t i start saving when I was younger, now I realize how much it’s important
From Moscow, living in Paris

That's pretty awesome that you're managing to pay for so many things by yourself
Seems like Slovenia has become a very nice country to live in
Significantly better than anywhere else
People go to St
Petersburg for culture and the arts, people go to Moscow to make money
&#x200B;
Moscow is essentially a western city when it comes to living standards
If gets called churka then he must be not Russian ethnically and sadly racism between the different ethnicities inside the federation can be quite high
&#x200B;
Most people dislike Moscow due to the focus it gets from the government whilst provincial cities stay in a state of disrepair
Way too many ppl in the north and several million deaths if it happens in winter
Nothing, because in Russia southern people aren't different from northern people
Finnish border will become a battlefield full of terrorism
Russian government: Crimea is now fully part of the federation
Ukrainian government: I'm gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move
White Sea Chechens would like an apology from you
Russian government: okay, we give Crimea back, but hold a referendum in the rest of Ukraine
HOI 4 gang
Don't know specifically about the Baltics, but in the former Soviet republics, there are a few older people who feel nostalgic about the USSR
Spoke with one elderly gentleman from Caucasus who told me "Why would you take such a great system
and just get rid of it
" I imagine for the older people, mass privatization was also quite a shock
A lot of them struggled to adjust ever since
People who grew up in the 60s-80s did not experience gulags or genocide the way the ones in the early years did
Yup
Like immigrants, poor people, minorities, gays, etc
When the economy goes down, just blame one of these groups and you will still get votes
I prefer it al dente but I don't get this Italian butthurt when foreigners don't do this
Yeah, I guess it's healthier than some mushy pasta, but we don't eat every food in the healthiest way possible, right
Or when they tell you that you can't break spaghetti apart because "it's long for a reason". That's just some bullshit snobbery to me
I started cooking it al dente after visiting Italy and I love it more than mushy because it gives texture and is chewy
At the same time in Rome it was too al dente for my taste
I heard it different regionally and Roman's pasta is the hardest
Is it true
Al dente on steroids
Eastern spy detected
The speculation is that it takes longer to digest, therefore it keeps you full for a longer period and you don't have to overeat
> butchering the French language, or making a weird version of the American flag
Or citing russian literature all wrong
But people don't claim to make their pasta the Italian way
they just take some noodles and cook them their own way, without saying that it's "basically the same as in Italy".
I was so ignorant, thanks for enlightening me
What's the reason for this judgment I don't get
It will still be long and have the same consistency if I break it into to equal parts
I suppose you'd be hungry sooner when you eat mushy pasta
That makes sense, but I just don't claim to make an Italian dish
Everything except the fourth sound like Russia
Yes, I've stumbled upon some "Spelling bee" videos on Youtube
I've never seen anything like that in Russian
And it makes sense, as the differences between spelling and pronunciation are much more noticeable in English
Russian has its own quirks which may cause you to misspell a word, but it's more or less a phonetic language
Ain’t that a familiar feeling
good joke, mate
Moscow - is not Russia, money go there to die, inhabited by entitled rich pricks which are permanently busy and running somewhere and think that there is no life outside of Ring road, also they say Maaaaskva;
Saint Petersburg - Cultural Capital, Window to Europe and Land of Porebriks, inhabited by eccentric snobs, art connoisseurs and alcoholics, every Petersburgian homeless person will quote Pushkin and Dostoyevsky to you while asking for a sigarette; the weather is awful & never ending rain;
Siberia - very cold and everyone is tough and stoic and has very strong health (because people with weak health simply don't survive);
Kazan' - nice, old, inhabited by Tatars;
Kuban' - heat, sea, watermellons, everyone will be very friendly and will try to use you for their profit;
Russian Far East - nature is stunning, cheap caviar and everyone is going to China/Korea/Japan for vacations because it's cheaper and faster than traveling to Moscow
Exactly, lol
Isn't it as easy as if you're living near the Canadian/Mexican border
As an american (citizen of US, actually) you live in confederation, transformed into a country
European Union is kinda quasi-confederation too, but with much more independency in it's countries
So, basically, imagine that driving from state to state is almost the same as from country to country
Judging by the lack of pages in most European languages, a [multicooker]
UPD: Oh, and a "zavaroćnyj" teapot, a small china teapot where you brew your concentrated tea *zavarka*. Then you add *zavarka* to your cup and dilute it with hot water from a kettle/samovar
It's becoming somewhat popular in Russia lately
Our old flat from the 1980's came with socket protectors on all sockets: they were sprung discs that you had to rotate 90° to align the holes in them with the socket
And a bottle scraper to get every drop you've paid for
Stews and porridges, mostly
Pulled pork
Clotted cream and yoghurt
It's too small for cooking soup for the whole family, otherwise I would use it for soups as well
Many countries in Europe restrict the types of knives you can carry: no locks in England, no one-handed opening in Germany and so on
In Russia anything under 3
5"/9cm is legal, even if it's a fully-automatic OTF double-edged knife
It's more of an electric pot with temperature control
Writing letters on paper and sending them in envelop by post
Also postcards are dying (or maybe dead)
Vodka and spirits are becoming less popular than wine and bear
OMG, Russia has most users and they're second to Germany on postcards sent qty
Very much surprising, thanks
The good news that such road is not in the mountains and there is no precipice at the other side =) Otherwise, things are getting even more complicated
Kalinka is a very popular instantly recognizable Russian folk song
Also katyusha
Monica Zetterlund is the essence of Sverige
Новгород (Newtown) is one of the oldest places in Russia
Lol if you translate Nevada from Russian you’ll get grammatically incorrect “no water”
Saint-Petersburg definitely is the most foreign because it's an old European city, built by European architects on Royal money
Everything else is pretty typical in of itself I'd say, except Moscow, obviously, because of country centralised nature
Old parts of Kaliningrad is also note worthy but it *is* an old German city, converted basically
Saint Petersburg
It’s basically a mishmash of European cities quite unlike any other
Petersburg stands out in architecture only
And only in the historical imperial center of the city
Everything else is more or less the same as in any other big Russian city
I have been to some, outside of several religious buildings here and there I wouldn't say there is a major difference
It might be different in smaller villages I'd say but we are talking about major (relative to local area) urban centers
I am from Kalmykia myself and would not say that Elista is significantly different *as a city*
(But maybe I misunderstood the question a bit)
No argument here
For Eastern Europe I lean to "should". Russian is by far the most popular Slavic language, as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations
On the other hand, most Slavic languages are already more or less mutually intelligible
For the entire Europe — hell no
Russian grammar is very hard for foreigners, and all these cases, genders and conjugations will be as much of pain in the ass for them as English tenses and articles are for me (Russian language only has four tenses, and that's if you count full and short future forms as different tenses since they use different grammar, and it doesn't have articles)
Serbian people, what script do you mostly use, Latin or Cyrillic
All these results make me sad, our serbian brothers are switching to the evil side (joking)
It’s not so hard to use cyrillic, guys, it’s just your habit
Cyrillic alphabet is cool and special
We used to use latin for Russian only when there was no cyrillic available for websites in 90s, now 99,99% of russian web is in cyrillic and only our immigrants in other countries who don’t have russian keypad may type in latin
Our keyboards have 2 letters – Cyrillic and Latin – shown on each key, so you don't have to memorise them specifically
Selling of Alaska mb
Going communist
Invading Chechnya, but not technically an invasion as it was already part of the country
I'm not too familiar with pre-Enlightment Europe, what exactly did the Teutonic Order do
Wasn't it a group of knights
Had no choice during WWII as the Germans would’ve annihilated you like they did to Serbia
The fact that you protected so many Jewish people is impressive and deserves international recognition
Are you sure that it was like
Latvia: hmm, will we give it away or not
USSR: Please, I beg you, pleeeease
Latvia: hmmm, I will think about it, but who knows
USSR: Pleeeease
I stand on knees
Latvia: Well, uuf, ok, take it for some time
Not like you had much of a choice, USSR could do anything it wanted especially as it was during wartime
Who knows
Not that bad for Russia, but very bad for the Caucasus and Central Asia
Russians don't need Istanbul
"Prussia which played a key role in the destruction of Polish-Lithuanian Union"
And then lead to some very very very bad things happening centuries later down the road
Fox, meet henhouse
It's not that close tho
For example, we still have Kamchatka which is just a bit further from US than Alaska
The reason to keep Alaska is the wealth of this land, but you know, who knew how it would've turned out
Russia has lost wars before; even if what you're saying is right, what would make you think this would be different
If Russia should've been killed by another country, it would be Polandlithuania (one of the most egalitarian and advanced countries in Europe who sought to include Russia as a core country) or France (ditto, it's a continent-wide tragedy that Napoleonic France lost)
In both cases Moskva was taken
Yes I feel very bad for the other soviet republics, they really got screwed over
Compared to places like Czechia and Slovakia which emerged from the ruins of communism smelling of roses
From Los Angeles
Are you sure that's the primary target
The primary targets are located in the East of the US
&#x200B;
Em, and btw I wasn't talking about military, Idk why you start talking about it
Because Russia is not only a big Putin armed with bombs and ready to destroy the world
We live here and we want to live a good life
Thus, we need money
That's the thing
Well, ok, it would benefit in military way
Im just saying it's not the only reason
But ok, I agree that it could've changed the way the world is developing now
We already share a border with Mongolia and Belarus, why would we benefit from bordering with another small country
Given that where I live humidity is often high during winter it's hard to pinpoint the "cold" range, it can be even above 0 sometimes
Freezing: below -10C
Cold: +5 to -10C
Chilly: +5 to +18C
Nice: +18 to +25C
Warm: +25 to +28C
Hot: +28C and above
Tend to agree with minor differences
\+35 hell for you
For YOU
You're fucking live in hell
Same
Wow, I know which flag I will choose for the next question "which flag you like the most"?
Im not, but same here
I live at 55°N and lack of sun is worse part of winter for me
I'm OK with cold weather when it's  sunny
I live at 56° and I absolutely detest this half of the year for this
I have a friend in Murmansk, it's currently a polar night there, his answer:
"A lot of people complaining about it, but personally I don't care because I spend whole *day* in the office
And I love polar day because I can cycle at *night*."
So, people just used to it, I guess
Sun sets before 4 pm (15:48 today) where I live
I'm more concerned about cold weather and overall hrash climate than daylight hours
Alcohol
At least you have warm Gulfstream
The most recent one is the Soviet industrialization
So, the first five-year plan was proposed in 1927 and most plants were operational by 1933
Of course, a lot of them were bought in the USA, but no one has disassembled steelworks and car factories just sitting around waiting for a buyer
Especially for a buyer who needs everything in metric
So either the writers of the show had no idea how hard it is to design and build multiple heavy industry plants from scratch, or they had to retcon a lot of negotiations with the US in the 20's.
That's an oddly specific phrase lol
You got it almost right, it's "mochevoj puzyr", but there's "mocheispuskatelnyj kanal", which means "urinary tract".
But honestly, if I heard a foreigner say any of these albeit a bit wrong, I'd be so impressed and probably very confused that I wouldn't even notice it
Getting back to your question, it's not really a foreign language, and the word is pretty widespread, but oh well
I don't speak Tatar at all, but my friend was impressed that I know what "quraq bash" is
It means "dickhead" btw
Absolutely right
Idk why i like Sheffield United [logo]
For Moscow, if you're walking around the historic part of the city, I'd say Kak Upoitelny v Rossii Vechera
For Sankt Peterburg
Honestly would associate Paris the most with the soundtrack from Amelie or something

Яжемать is an entitled woman
But its not the same as helicopter parenting
> Haven't met a "яжеотец/yazheotets" (but-I'm-a-father) yet
It definitely appears in google, but I personally haven't heard it before either
I think it's flexible
Короче яжемать считает что ей все должны.
А речь идет про сюсюкание с ребенком в итоге которого получается беспомощное избалованное говно
Helicopter parenting is not about the mother
Living in Moscow, I've never been to  Palace of Facets, Armory Chamber and other museums inside the Kremlin, shame on me
I think they won't close anytime soon, so I still have a chance (and maybe that's a reason - I think I always have time so maybe next time)
But I've been to inside Lenin Mausoleum, that was by pure chance and unplanned beforehand, I just found myself on the Red Square and decided to check if it's still open and voila -- it was
Maybe 15 years ago or so
Did you know its spire is 123m tall
We have a counting aid like that
We usually say «Один и-и-и, два и-и-и, три и-и-и...», which means «One a-a-and, two a-a-and, three a-a-and
» and so on
They also use similar aid in the army to count down 3 seconds and synchronize volleys: «Три-и-иста, три-и-идцать, три!» or «Three hundred thirty three». [1:24]
Neither do we, just pausing between numbers
I'd recommend to go for STEM degrees
And not only because there is demand, but also because Russian education in social sciences and the humanities is lackluster in comparison
Russia actually has one of the best STEM educations
From my perspective as a theoretical physicist (and a person still involved in higher education, to some degree), yes, Russia is competitive in my area of science
Russian education in physics excels at theoretical physics and its mathematical foundations in particular, but the experimental base might be subpar due to the lack of funding; most top-notch labs are still in the West
The education is also somewhat lacking in other aspects important to my profession, like giving public speeches, writing, English language, team collaboration and so on, I often find foreign students and scientists more competent in these areas
Top Western universities also usually offer better work contacts from the get-go
But overall, Russian graduates from top universities are a welcome addition to the scientific groups in most countries
Yeah, lack of funding
everybody knows why
What a waste with the potential we have
Good caviar
It's impossible to find in my experience outside of Russia
I love saunas, I am from Russia and now live in the U.S and I struggle with the lack of saunas even in hotels =(
We do it as well
We call it "riga", I wonder if it's a Finnic or a Slavic word
To be honest, writing about flavor is like writing about what sex feels like
You could try but you'll never do it justice
Suffice it to say though that good caviar is nearly always served fresh so it's less salty, has a divine texture and pops in your mouth
Goes great with crackers lol
Yes we do have wooden cabins (we call them banya) and saunas very popular in Russia
I just noticed literally everything I said after the sex comparison could be read as a string of euphemisms
Yay me
Sami oppression was bad but gone by the late 1800s wasn't it
It didn't really affect many folk anyway since noone ever lived in Sapmi anyway
At most we're talking 100k folk (there're about 30k Sami nowadays)
> Co-founders of eugenics
Rome would like a word
Honestly I looked this up and I don't really see how Sweden played a role
Maybe 1 Swede was involved
I don't think you can really fault Sweden for much in that
> During the Commonwealth days our Nobility had a nasty pass time of forcibly Polonizing the Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians
Like Iwan said this isn't really true
Most Belarusians who care hate the concentration camps in Interwar Poland which disproportionately targeted Belarusians
Not sure if they targetted Ukrainians, as well
Frankly medieval Polandlithuania is something many Belarusians eagerly identify with over Russian empire, and it's understandable why with all the civilities of Polandlithuania
Also let's not forget communist Poland
What about on both
No deal in Russia
You just go and buy any random scissors
Well, we would need to prepare yet again for a new invasion
From Russia with "ah shit here we go again"
I would be getting invaded
> bomb
Now, with radioactive fallout and 16 times the detail
And majority of Russians are really looking forward to burning down Moscow again anyway
Слыш, это международный ресурс епта, фильтруй базар
Dear French, wish to inform you about the internationality of this site
Funny how you really think both Hitler and Napoleon failed solely because of cold weather
And that'll be your fatal mistake
You'll all die of heat strokes
With winters like this, slippers and towels are better suited for the invasion of Moscow
Police of humor has arrested you
I don't know if that's how Ukrainians think about it, but from a Russian perspective pelmeni (dumplings) ≠ vareniki, so the answer is "we don't have dumplings with fruit fillings". The truth is we actually have them, only we call them differently
Haha, no problem
In Russia, at least where I live, we have both pelmeni and vareniki
The primary difference between the two is in the shape of the shell: vareniki look like [this] and pelmeni like [this]
Traditionally, pelmeni are filled with ground meat, and vareniki with fruits/jams, potatoes, cottage cheese, or just herbs
However, that's not what really makes them "different dishes". What makes them different is the shape
If you use a "wrong" filling with a vareniki-shaped dumpling, it will still be considered vareniki, and vice versa with pelmeni
And I've actually seen vareniki with meat
Also we have [lazy vareniki] that are different from both vareniki and pelmeni, and they don't have any fillings
I hope I didn't overwhelm you
That's my sloppy typing, and google corrected it anyway
I’ll go inside and order something from the menu, if the kitchen is closed (shouldn’t be, 11:45 is too early for that) there would be plenty 24/7 cafes or restaurants, burgers are probably my favorite, sushi as a second choice
Mexican also good but hard to find
It depends on where I am, after four beers there's huge chances I'd sneak into another bar close by and order whatever special they have
But if I'm really have to go, I'd get a shawarma or a burger
It's definitely [Saint Basil's Cathedral]
Actually, it is almost the same place
I’d say it defines a western style of life
Not a European one
And the USA maybe even more in it than Europe
Yeah, but you can also become 300% European if you feed your dog with dog meat
> Are there wildlife and trees growing
Google "Chernobyl virtual tour".
Yeah you don’t want to fuck with Belarusian authorities
There're some three hundred years when we were not free
1480 (Mongol-Tatar yoke was lifted completely) - 1605 (it's complicated, but basically Poland tried to get Russia under itself), 1612 (poles were expelled from Moscow and the rest of the country by the Second Volunteer Army) onwards
Tsardom of Russia: 1547 - 1917
Soviet union: 1922 - 1991
Modern Russian federation: 1991 - 2020+
This is pretty much the meat of it
Specifically, after the [Mongol invasion] in 13th century
Some nationalists claim 1917-1991 was an occupation as well
Well, there was no one entity and only interconnected principalities and such
Conquering them was an easy task for such a force as the Horde
Im more nationalist and can say that it was just a small reshape of the same country
Calling Soviet period "occupation" is a must to any self respecting Eastern European nationalist
It wasn't \`small\` in all meanings)
Because for them it was foreign
I don’t think the same logic applies to russians being occupied by russians (не в этническом смысле)
Paris is shit to me
Pete’s night life is the tits, and I say that as a Muscovite that used to dance the night (and brain cells) away in his rowdy youth
Yeah, St

Have you been to Depo foodmarket at Belorusskaya metro station
As the resident fattie I highly recommend mussels with parmesan and black pepper at "Mollusca"
I tell everyone Milan is Moscow in Italy
Н is basically N and pronounced as Enn
We also have a ”soft“ version of the letter
For example, the hard Н can be heard in the word ”No” while the soft version can be heard in the word ”New”.
Everything is the same with the English N, but when we pronounce it, we put the tongue on the teeth, not above them
> while the soft version can be heard in the word ”New”.
Most native English speakers pronounce it the same way as in other positions, though
And as for the Latin letter, most people say аш/aš, like the French
Maybe Monaco
I don’t agree with them serving as a tax haven for sketchy corporations and individuals
Chechnya isnt a country
I don't get this logic, tbh
I travel to places because I want to visit their historical, cultural and natural attractions
Not because I agree or disagree with their politics which actually has very little effect on the trip
Vive l’Empereur
In Russia the law says about sensible amount of self-defence too but from what I’ve heard it’s a choice between death and sentence
My friend’s cop and he said that even they are mostly not allowed to use guns, especially for self defence
I’ve seen a lot of cops with empty holsters
We have only one police that is called police and deals with regular crimes everywhere
The National Guard, the Investigations Committee  and the FSB do their own stuff
Military police polices only the military
First year we just learn World history, then (for the remaining 5 years) World history alongside Russian history (starting from the arrival of slavs in 6th century)
What were "empires coming and falling, scientific development, literature" on the territory of USA
Afaik only central and southern Americas had centralized states, while territory of USA was inhabited by tribal societies with development level similar to European bronze age
In Russia we learn about every single president
It’s easy because we’ve only had 2
In their life, it would depend on many things
But after their deaths their heirs would have inherited both countries and it would depend then on their wishes and tendencies in countries
If heirs decided to unite them, then why not
Btw [
I was 17 when I finished school and 18 when started university (my birthday is in summer btw)
I guess it's the most common age, but I also have a coursemate who started uni at 16, though she's a rare case
When I graduated we had 10 years of school, so I started at 6 and graduated at 16
These days parents are not in a hurry to send kids to school, so they start at 7, and since 2001 everyone has to spend 4 years in primary school, not 3 like me, so kids will graduate at 18 if they turn 8 during the first grade
What if you finish school before 18 because you, say, started earlier
Or does that never happen
Our system is 11 years of school, normally starting at the age of 6-7, although I know people who went to school at 5 or 8
Omsk is a short form of Omskaya Krepost'(Omsk Fortress)
Omskaya because it is on river Om'. The name "Om'" according to one version comes from the Turkic word om - "quiet".
Kostroma city has a Slavic origin, related to Russian костёр(bonfire, brome grass), there is also East Slavic deity named Kostromá.
Moscow/Moskva <- grad Moskov <- river Moskva/Mosky
The name has a disputed etymology, is likely Baltic in origin, as Galindians lived there before the Slavs
If it's Baltic, then it probably means something like "marshy, waterlogged".

In my country the best and most expensive is Moscow State University
There a lot of good universities but I can’t mention them
I don’t remember all of them
I can say about my university
Pyatigorsk State University
It’s the on the top 10 of the best linguistic universities
> Far Eastern Federal Univeristy
Nahh
They have a cool student society, but the university itself is a victim of the "optimization" of higher education in my opinion
> because Baltika Kaliningrad and FC Luch Vladivostoka are in the same league :o
I was so disappointed Baltika didn't perforn bad enough to be demoted to PFL
Just imagine someone with a World Cup-level stadium competing with teams whose stadium is a muddy puddle
Is switching to the standard dialect something people do or can be asked to do in your country
Someone wrote on another website that a Bavarian will try speaking Hochdeutsch with a foreigner, but asking a person from Manchester to speak RP is unthinkable

They *should be* the same, not *should be made* the same
* [Pelmeni] usually filled with ground meat
* [Vareniki] (the same as Polish pierogi, but this word means "pies" in Russia)
Stuffed with potatoes, jams, cottage cheese or even just herbs
Even though the traditional fillings are different, the primary difference between the two kinds of dumplings is the shape
If it's shaped like pelmeni but has a "wrong" filling, it'll still be (weird) pelmeni
Also with [quark] It's a good lactovegetarian substitute for meat dumplings
I have some in my freezer
Wow
Thank you, I remembered that I have a lot of food in my freezer
Pelmeni is THE student food with smetana
[Okroshka] with [kefir] or [kvass]
There's also okroshka with mineral water

Australia
Maybe I've  just whatched "H2O" to much when I was a kid
Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Great Britain(villages), Sweden, Italy(northern part of it) . I don't know why but I like how Swedish language looks like
Same here pal
Vladimir Puti
wait, there is FSC at my door
Putin
It's easy, Putin
He is not even alive now
Older generations are blinded by propaganda, they love and trust Putin
So yes, most people like him
They see him as the "saviour of Russia", even though he and his people steal a lot of money and many people are very poor
Probably because russians are submissive, most of us are descendants of slaves . We've never had democracy too
First tsars and emperors, then dictators
I guess Yeltsin counts as democracy, but those weren't the best times
Here it's rock, scissors, paper
The rock blunts the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper wraps up the rock
Also for some reason we often had the "scissors first" rule: everyone makes scissors on the first round, and then we had a second round that was the real one
No idea why we did that
Personally, I spend about 175€ /month
I don't cook at home, I eat mainly in cafes and restaurants
In supermarkets I buy only semi-finished products, meat, milk, cheese and something like that
The cost of food in a family of 4 persons will be lower
About 425 €/month in my city
I spend up to 150 EUR
Usually I buy grains (buckwheat, rice, bulgur, pea, pearl barley, lentil) and pasta when I find it on sales, chicken, eggs, veggies, rarely fruits
I gave up buying cheese because edible ones are too expensive for me
The problem here Russians spend 30% of the salary on food
Or even 50% for poor people
In my region average salary is 480 euro and median salary is 400 euro
Prices mostly +-5-7% as in Europe (I checked prices in Germany this year)
I don’t count how much I spend on food
I think that people should eat what he wants and don’t be thrifty when it comes to food
Well, today I ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and vegetables
It cost 130₽.
Very cheap, is that kinda cantina in a university
If I cooked the same dish at home, it would be half the price
I'm lazy af
No, this is a cafe in the city center near the university
If you have the desire and time, then you can find even cheaper
Divinely tasty shaurma of usual sizes costs 100₽, a large 150₽.
It's almost like communist countries were different
I heard really good stories about Tito's Yugoslavia
Really interested by it, seems like a much more eficient version of the USSR
Even by commieblock standarts Ceaușescu was cruel idiot
Dude didn't realise Stalin times are over
I met some older people who lamented that it disappeared
One older gentleman told me "why would you take something so great
and ruin it"
And tbf for some countries, it took them until the late 2000s to reach the same living standards they had during the USSR, like Russia for example
If you lived in Russia between 1991 and 2005, you arguably had it worse than during the late USSR years
Where in Croatia do you live
Yugoslavia definitely seemed like the best socialist nation at the time
Life in the USSR was significantly worse
The downside of Yugoslavia is that it relied on Tito to survive
I (think I) can get by with Russian in all of the ex-USSR, probably in other Slavic countries and maybe in the tourist-y areas all around Europe
It's possible to get by in Slavic countries if the other person is open to establishing rapport with you
Otherwise you would have to stick to some tourist areas in Turkey, Egypt, Thailand or some parts of Spain
Practically anywhere in Central, and Eastern Europe and parts of central Asia
I think that nowhere
Don’t think that anybody will be able to understand me
Yeah, but it requires both parties to be motivated
It's especially easy when Russian is a common language in a country
Plenty of Russian tourists go to Georgia, they get by somehow
Unlike Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia also have something like a quarter of their inhabitants being native Russian speakers
It's extremely easy to get by with just Russian in Tallinn from what I've seen
Certainly in touristy places even the native Estonians will often have some knowledge of Russian
A couple of times natives ended up switching to Russian with me after they understood that I was from Russia, even though I started out speaking in English for politeness sake
That's not true, most of Russians study only one foreign language: English
Well, maybe these Russians ended up in Germany exactly because they learned German :)
It was available in my school, but only 5 people out of ~100 in my year studied it
And it's not available in most schools
It was more common in the Soviet Union, though
It was actually 2 out of 45 after the 9th year when most students went to college or changed school

Zootopia made me a furry back in 2016
Please tell r/yiffinhell that puppy play isn't furry, they have 2 posts on their front page with that rn
Also, their description is literally "An archive of the furry fandom at its worst
", which means that not all furries are like that
And, well, I don't really interact (as in, communicate with other ppl in it) with the fandom, I mostly just lurk r/furry_irl, and it's mostly alright
I don't like all these "all furries should be killed" kind of jokes, I know (or at least hope) that it's just a comedic overreaction, but still

I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it but I loved walking alone in Moscow (center) at night, always took a chance to go on long walks after nights out around 2-5 am, never felt unsafe
But then again I was born there and know how to navigate it
Oh yeah, I’m a woman
Petersburg
I'd say biggest threats are natural: dirt, ice, puddles, potholes etc, in the dark it's harder to watch your step
Other than that you should be fine
Moscow is generally safe
This maybe not a solid cover and having holes  (i.e. big parks), but I personally would not be afraid walking on streets
Same, but I would say that everywhere in Moscow feels safe, not just the center
I used to work nightshifts so I would often go out at 1-4 am and head to the grocery store, and sometimes not to the closest one (yeah, we have lots of 24-hour supermarkets here)
I live in Bibirevo, and that's like on the very outskirts of Moscow
I can't remember being scared even once, and nothing bad ever happened to me (but that's just my experience, maybe I've just been lucky and reckless
Nice joke mate, living in Kupchino screams at night were more like a regular backdrop than something unnatural
I would avoid industrial areas and districts with a lot of migrants from southern regions

Nizhny Novgorod, Russia
A completely new 3 to 4 room apartment (~150 m^2 ) in the very center of the city, near the Kremlin
Or a 400 to 800 m^2 house depending on the location
There are some 110 sqm flats literally across the road from the Kremlin being sold for this price
There must be a catch
A 64 sqm flat in the poshest district of Moscow or a 68 sqm flat behind the Bolshoi
A 140 sqm flat in the district where I live, in perfect condition
A kremlin is just a Russian version of a castle, so many old Russian cities have kremlins
Use taxi apps, don't even try to catch a taxi by yourself, especially at airports

The Aeroexpress train has almost become a scam now
The ticket is 400 RUB per person, so if there are three of you it's 1200 RUB, you can get a taxi to your hotel for this price from SVO or VKO or just take a bus to the nearest metro/MCD station
DME is a bit further off, so the price is more reasonable
Taxi is cheap, true enough
But there are huge traffic jams in Moscow
If you don't have much time and don't want to risk, Aeroexpress is a better option

Most of the stuff I can find on Wikipedia's list of Russian dishes *is* commonly served at home or in canteens
Maybe large savoury pies
No one has time to cook them at home, and they are too boring for eating out
Karavaj, the bread they use when they welcome dignitaries with bread and salt
Various mead-like alcoholic drinks: sbitenj, medovuha
We only drink them when touring the Golden Ring
That's because America is known for it, not Italy
Sauerkraut is very popular here
I didn't know it was originally a German dish before I read it somewhere a year ago or so
Same here with vodka, which is far from being the most popular alcoholic beverage and is mainly seen as something only alcoholics drink
Also, I'm under the impression that full or partial abstinence from alcohol is more common and more socially acceptable here than elsewhere in Europe
But we don't fry it like these barbarians do
We call it "квашеная капуста", which means "soured cabbage".
Maybe, that was actually the case for me as well, though coming from my grandfather
But there could be a more general trend of people turning to a healthier lifestyle
Apparently smoking, alcohol and (other) drugs are nowhere near as popular as they were in the 90s and early 2000s.
Yes, the only cooked sauerkraut we eat can be found in soups
If it's a side dish, it's raw, crunchy sauerkraut
First world problem
In Moscow, it doesn't go below -20 often, but we had a week or so when it did just recently
At such times, yes, everything works as it should, including all public transport, deliveries, and other services
I can't answer about how difficult it is to start a car since I don't drive, but the roads are packed as usual
Regarding the clothes: I don't wear either thermal underwear or any type of sweater because I'd have to change clothes every time I get inside, and I hate changing often, so it's just my laziness
I just wear my usual pants, a warm winter coat, a scarf, and I cover my head with the hood
When outside, you tend to walk very quickly if you don't want to freeze your ass
Now, a real problem: phones do fail you when you need them the most
I had my phone shut down at 40% when I was in the middle of nowhere at 4am and had to order a taxi to get back home, and that was no fun at all
I've had it switch off on other occasions as well, but it wasn't a big problem as I was close to home
All I said applies to any temps below -10
With huge snowfalls there can be some minor disruptions in the suburban trains schedule
Other than that life just goes on
The biggest shit is black ice or when all the snow melts
Then it's huge pain in the ass (but not impossible) to walk anywhere, even the central parts of Moscow
Yeah, in Moscow it really doesn’t go below -20 often like u/sliponka said, he perfectly summed it up
One more thing is that really difficult to look at the phone screen when your eyes adapt to all the whiteness of snow around (idk if that just me though)
I don't wear gloves, just hold my hands in the pockets, and generally it's fine to take them out to use your phone as long as it doesn't take more than a minute or a few minutes
Not a very pleasant sensation but not a big deal either
A few years ago, I had either magic gloves or a phone with a particularly sensitive screen, where I could easily use the phone with the gloves on
But I'm not sure it works universally
Otherwise, yes, you'd just take off the gloves
Can't imagine how there could be ice in the bus as Moscow busses are heated rather well (and sometimes too much), but maybe you weren't lucky and caught a bus with a broken heater
Still great you enjoyed your trip, though
I guess it's quite aged, but it works fine when I'm not spending much time outside, so I'll wait until I really need it
You know, the later you update something, the later you'll have to do that again
Thank you for the advice, though
Perhaps you were in Korolyov or Zhukovsky
Those two are outside of Moscow, though, so they could easily have older busses
Code is English only
Switching between keyboard layouts every time you need to type a variable or function name would be insane and transliteration into Latin alphabet looks ugly and it's mostly used by students who just haven't learned English yet
Comments can be in Russian or English but some editors and IDEs can mess up encodings so a comment in Russian has a chance to render as an unintelligible gibberish when the code is opened with a different editor
It's always English if it's not 1C.
Always English
People who name variables and functions using transliterated Russian words suck
Comments and inline documentation, depends
If those who read them are expected to always be inside Russia, it might make sense to write it in Russian
However, if I have a choice, I write everything in English
The job itself is mostly the same as anywhere, I think
It's also one of the highest paid professions here, especially in Moscow
As for the education, it depends heavily on your specialization
We mostly studied some fundamental things like algorithm theory, computer architecture and network theory, the practical programming itself was pretty basic (but not BASIC, lol)
Yes
There's a period when hanging out with the other gender is uncool, somewhere around ages 9-14
After that socializing in mixed-gender groups is normal and fine
Having a close friend of the opposite gender is rarer, but possible
People will gossip behind your backs trying to establish if you two actually fuck or if at least one of you is gay
Your SO might also get jealous
- Allo/алло if it's my home or mobile phone and I don't know who's calling
- Da/да/yes or Слушаю/slušaju/[I'm] listening if it's my office phone and I don't know who's calling
- Привет, $callername/Privet, $callername/Hello $callername if it's someone I know
If I had to answer calls to an externally reachable number on my office phone then I would answer it like
- $companyname, ортоксерокс, чем могу помочь?/$companyname, ortokseroks, ćem mogu pomoć?/$companyname, orthoxerox, how can [I] help
“Yes
”, “Listening”, “Allo” as the most frequent
Some people have their ‘personal’ greetings, eg I often say “attentively” (the “listening” part, which comes after the adverb in Russian, is implied)
If I don’t know the person who is calling I’m going to be silent until the caller introduces him/herself
If that doesn’t happen, I end the call and block the number
Oh, boy, that's a complicated question
- Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was proclaimed on the 12th of June 1990
- however, RSFSR itself was founded on the 7th of November 1917
- but if it was a successor to the Russian Republic that was a successor to the Russian Empire that was a successor to the Russian Tsardom that was a successor to the principality of Moscow, then it's 1263, when the principality was finally given to a specific cadet branch
- however, the *grand* principality of Moscow was grand because it subsumed the grandness of its parent grand principality of Vladimir, which was split off from Pereyaslavl principality in 1125
- and of course, since the grand principality of Moscow became the only sovereign principality ruled by Rurikid princes, they could claim the heritage of the whole Old Rus, which was founded in 862 in Novgorod

in most languages)
No, because our labor classes are gendered
I wish I had
While girls had cooking and sewing, we boys had useless shit like how to operate a turning lathe
I wanted to cook and they allowed me to learn with the girls
I also liked woodwork when we had it as boys, but I hated some other courses
Dividing classes based on gender is a stupid remnant of our 'sacred values' and 'traditions' where a woman is supposed to be in the kitchen and a man at work
Some other boys wanted to cook too, but they hesitated to ask because they didn't want to 'appear effeminate'.
We also called it *технология* (technology)
This idea never crossed my mind back then
I'm fairly sure a kid would be made fun of by other kids even for asking to attend classes for the opposite gender
I also find it completely stupid and reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes
Cooking or
handling basic instruments are useful regardless of gender, and women aren't disadvantaged at being modern machine-tool operators either
Yes and Russia is very sexist
I remember one of the earlier South Park episodes had Kenny as the only boy that attended home ec instead of shop class
So even though that's pretty sexist, it's not *incredibly* outdated
Do they expect people who graduate from Gymnasiums to have domestic servants
They made jokes about my learning with the girls a couple of times, but mostly they would be friendly and say things like "it's great that at least you don't have to do that shit" or something along those lines
But all of those skills are useful for everyone, and it's a shame that I still can't sew a button properly
Mario Fernandez, football player from Brazil, received Russian citizenship some years ago and he still can't speak Russian
But he regularly scoring amazing goals for Russian national team
I personally would like immigrants to learn Russian but my wishes don't really matter
None of the migrants here do anyway
A handful of elite athletes is pretty irrelevant in the grand scale of things
As a general rule, one would still want naturalised citizens to know Russian
No, no one skips school on the first of March, but spring school holidays usually start around the end of March, so there's no reason for truancy
What is the neighborly etiquette like in your country
Is it normal to be friends with neighbors or you rather keep your distance from them
> I have the keys to pretty much ***any*** house in the street and ***they have mine***.

Just reading this gives me anxiety
Same, but some do
I tend to think those who look for friends in neighbours are older than average redditors but it barely depends on country
This is starting to sound more and more like people in the Netherlands have some very interesting ideas about personal space and property
Lemme just pop in your house real quick

This is amazing to me since I grew up in a concrete human hive in a so-called “sleeping district”. No one knew each other there, except for grannies who liked to sit on the benches near the entrance
I’ve moved to a smaller (and recently built) apartment complex, we do have a chat group for communal activities (such as figuring out and scolding whoever failed to pick up their dog’s shit or is making noisy renovations outside scheduled hours, sometimes for bbq and beer), also another one for the community shared property management and maintenance issues, but I still don’t know the names of the neighbors on my floor
In fact, we barely acknowledge each other by saying “hello” and avoiding eye contact while riding the elevator together awkwardly
30 min by subway, I live right next to a station and work right next to another one
20 min walk to the station, 1 - 1,5 hr train ride and 15 min walk to the uni
3 minutes to bus stop, 8-10 minutes bus ride to the workplace (corporate shuttle) same time to go back
When the weather is fine I walk back home, takes 50-60 minutes depending on the route
7 minutes walk to metro station
5 minutes on metro
Then 5 minutes to cross the road, enter the building and take an elevator to my workplace
Not many people in Moscow are lucky to live that close to work
Semen Ang Geyorgy
Odessa mama, Rostov papa
It's actually pronounced Semyon though
It should be spelled this way too, Семён. But ё is kinda non-obligatory letter in Russian and is often replaced with e, even though they sound completely different, and Semyons had fallen victims for it
Agamemnon
Artaxerxes
Amoxiclav
It's pronounced Semyon and actually should be spelt like it but infamous letter ё often gets replaced with e in writing
It's a rather popular meme of Odessite culture
And Odessite cuture is one of the pillars of Soviet-era culture
So, there are countless places where you can see that slogan
Basically, Odessa was major port, run by volatile mix of jewish gangsters, jewish officials and jewish intelligentsia
Those three groops intersect of course
It was a great treasure which we sadly lost
Tbh, it's not the best name
Especially considering that it might be spelled in passport as Semen, lol
Yep
And common nickname is Сёма/Syoma
It's actually more of "old people's name" right now, not very frequent among younger generations
With a name like that he would have to love the heat
It depends
Those who go to university in a different city move right after high school
For others, it's normally from 20 to 30
24, still proudly living with my mom
It's common to visit parents during breaks but that's not considered going "home" by most students
It's like visiting friends or relatives
I guess that after university most students stay in the city of their uni (it's usually a bigger city than their hometown, so it's easier for them to find a job)
It's still common to visit parents, though
During early 1930-ies ethnic insurgency in Central Asia was supported by UK and locals beyond USSR/Chinese border
To end this Soviet secret service OGPU (predessesor of NKVD/KGB) orginasied so-called "Altay Volunteer Army", which actually was thousands of OGPU troops with armored cars and bombers supported by an unlikely ally - White Russian emigrants
They entered China and supported pro-Soviet warlord against anti-Soviet warlord, Ma Zhongying
Battles were rather fierce as White and Red russians and their local allies pressed on, in some cases OGPU troops were supported by bombers dropping chemical weapons
In the end, Ma Zhongying was forced to retreat
As his enemies closed in, he decided to flee and got on a plane that was supposed to extract him to Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Quomintang China
However plane was actually piloted by Soviet agents who flew Ma Zhongying to USSR, where he vanished in OGPU  prisons
I love that history bit for crazy crossovers, politicing around local tribes, overall Wild West of Warlord-era China, fucking chemical bombs etc
There should be a film about this war

What about salo
My Ukrainian ex from Kiev sweared youths don’t eat it anymore
> bears
Actually, I visited my extended family this summer in Zabaikaliye and bears were a real problem
One of them used to visit a summer camp just outside my village
And my grandparents neighbor was attacked while he was in taiga
I don’t know, 100% of Finns in Russian movies and ads are either drinking vodka, or are in sauna or both
Bears are just the big hamsters here
Who the hell rides hamsters
He is, but not in the way you're hoping
It's not epic and way sad
It's easy to judge from the outside but most people just want to live their lives peacefully, in all countries
They don't want to die for idea or turn into professional regime fighters
Peaceful methods to change something don't work because government is corrupt and has money and powers to repress and rig
We tried them, we try them still and a process is not going to stop but outcome is unclear
Violent methods can turn into a civil war and rob another generation or two or three of their normal life, and 90s were only 20 years ago, not even one generation had a chance to live their lives normally since previous cataclysm
It's not an easy choice and these people are not scared of nothing, the threat is more than real
It's not the Soviet mentality, it's a mentality of survivors
I personally am kinda annoyed by it too sometimes, but I can't judge
They are like that not because they are bad people or stupid people or subservient people, it's much more complex

One can even add some soy sauce
Only the Dutch have sandwiches for lunch
I think Norwegians do as well
That's insane
Why don't they just go outside and have a proper lunch like a lot of people do all over the world
Oh yeah, I get you
I used to hate it too due to childhood experiences in school mess hall
I also hate it as a breakfast meal
For some reason my love towards buckwheat was reignited after spending 4 months in South East Asia
I loved the food there and I’m an adventurous eater, yet with the passing of time I’ve started to crave familiar things: rye bread, buckwheat, borscht, heavy cream
That's because going barefoot to a carpeted bathroom is a disgusting experience
That Napoleon and Hitler invaded us in winter
Everyone loved Stalin
Whites weren't democratic and didn't recognize Polish independence
Iirc they even refuse Pilsudski's offer of 200000 strong army in exchange for independence recognition
How did you count that
Many people in the West think that the Soviet Union is as evil as Nazi Germany and they don't even think that the SU saved Europe by sacrificing millions of people
Why is it misconception
For vatniks(Russian boomers) and older generations, younger people tend to dislike him more
Being colonial empire
Speaking of damage done to Europe, did Stalin poison Europeans
Did he conduct cruel, crazy experiments on people
Did he start the war
Did he destroy two entire cities (it's more about the kind-generous-cute-nice-good US)
I don't decline that the SU was not the best thing for Europe, but comparing to Nazi Germany is irrelevant
Imagine thinking that USSR wanted to exterminate all Ukrainians
\> Also USSR and Germany were allied at the moment
What
Even if Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is called an alliance, it was signed many months after events we are talking about
And USSR offered help back then, it's a well accepted fact
But neither Poland (which was pressuring Czechoslovakia) nor Romania (out of general fear of Soviet troops) allowed transport of Red army into Czechoslovakia
\> Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was a final piece of years-long cooperation
It isn't bias, it is BIASUS MAXIMUS
While USSR didn't break all ties with Germany upon Hitler seizing power and continued programs like joint tank development, it was anti-Nazi in most of its efforts, both diplomatic and military (clearest case bing Spanish Civil War)
Again, Western historians do not doubt it at it is crystal clear that both commoners and diplomats of the time knew USSR was anti-Nazi power
That's why Molotov-Ribbentrop caused such shock
Because it was 180 degrees turn
\> Do you even know what was Molotov-Ribbentrop about
It was about creating spheres of influence, similar to the Portugal-Spain Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494
Yes, and i never challenged that
All i said is that prior to M-R USSR was hostile to Nazi Germany, and that denying that is just weird because just about any document of that era about this topic confirms it
Pretty common in Russian villages and small towns
Why so angry Olaf
When I was at school, there was hardly anything positive said about the Imperial era *per se* (and the same for the USSR), though figures like Peter, Catherine and Alexander II were singled out as having been effective as rulers
Not good, I should stress
Just effective
It might have changed in recent years though
As for whether it was good or bad
I don't know
probably on balance, bad as it did a lot of awful things like persecuting Jews; the ethnic cleansing of the Circassians and other groups; co-operating with Prussia and Austria in wiping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth off the map etc
But it wasn't totally evil: It tried to free the Slavic peoples of the Ottoman Empire; gave Finland the status of an autonomous province (something which to this day makes Alexander II rather popular there) etc
Why neutral for the ERE
Just the sheer number of times it brought itself back and recovered from disaster qualifies it as a great empire

And probably Leonid Parfyonov for the documentaries on Soviet and Russian history
And Следствие вели with Lenid Kanevskiy
And Igor Prokopenko for insane conspiracy theories
Not by the general populace cause they all love him, but the ones that can think
do I even need to say who
In traditional sense: General Vlasov
In being a synonym for traitor: Pavel Morozov
In results of betrayal: Boris Yeltsin
Synonym of the traitor is [Vlasov] Also sometimes [Mazepa]
Not European but Peter the "Great", Lenin, and Stalin all come to mind easy
And then you have more conventional traitors like Andrei Vlasov (defected WW2 general that led the Russian Nazi army)
Nikolai II, All Russian presidents as well
I live on Kuusinen street in Moscow lol
What about Peter III that gave away Berlin and whole Prussia in 30 years war
More like incompetent idealist/useful tool
Either way, even if yes, not on a scale of Yeltsin
He basically destroyed local culture and arts and tried to clone Russia like it was second Holland (the flag of Russia is literally based on Holland) but ended up failing bad
He and his 18th century successors basically set Russia back 200 or 300 years
Russia only grew geopolitically under him (and an oppressive backward state is nothing to be proud of when it grows)
Why do you think you are better than Belarus
And don't you think that being sold to NATO isn't much better
For me it's absolutely the same cause there's an option of not being sold at all
Yup
So do you really believe anyone in NATO will care about other in case of war
Especially the USA
They don't give a damn about European countries, Trump even doesn't know where's Romania
Do you mean 6th largest economy in the world is barely holding
Tell that to the EU, shoutout to Greece, Baltic and more
Ukraine was quite ok until they fell for NATO and EU promises and had a revolution
It's their choice to be the bargaining chip in western hands
Or were it Russians who were shooting people in the center of Kiev
When we were friends they got Crimea rental, weapons, special prices for gas etc
Nowadays they hate us and blame for everything bad in the world but still want special prices for gas
That's what I call self-esteem
BTW only whores and slaves are sold
I consider being a slave to anybody is bad
For me it's almost two similar things, but of course being a western slave is more profitable
But the price might be bigger too
Well tbh it's not quite like that
I mean yes we have a dictator but i wouldn't say that it affects me much
I mean I don't give a shit and just doing the most to live the best life
And most people live the same life
They don't care about Siriya and Ukraine, Putin and corruption
They just want to be not disturbed
BTW Here we often say that in developed countries people achieve smth with the help of the state, while in Russia we achieve anything despite state's "help".
In 2017 film about corruption of our prime minister Dmitry Medvedev came out
He has stolen more then a billion dollars from our country
That started a wave of protests in Russia and people now generally more interested in politics than ever
The latest one was this summer in Moscow
People were protesting for honest municipal elections, which results are almost always were fabricated
A lot of protesters were  arrested for political views
One guy was sentenced in jail for 4 years for throwing a plastic bottle . Political repressions in Russia are extremely obvious
Our government really pissed of with corruption being investigated by non-commercial organizations and press
After that film a lot of other really important officials were proven to be corrupt, so now we understand that our government exists only to steal money from people

I think objectively speaking, Su-30 in VMF dark naval grey paintscheme is absolutely stunning
But I've always been a huge sucker for American naval aviation
Which is also shameful, considering my grand dad and step dad were with the Soviet navy
Russian Navy Su-30 don't have canards
I think they still look great
Paint is just out of this world
RuNavy air arm has patrol crafts, Tu-22M3s, Su-30s, MiG-31s and many other types of aircrafts
They are obviously land based, but they provide support for naval operations
What's good for the Russian kills the German
Незваный гость хуже татарина - Univited guest is worse than a Tatar
Sometimes we say something like "I'm freezing like a german in '41".
I'd say physical punishment to children
Whereas in Germany you can get away with murder of a spouse and indeed be praised on account of being brown, in Russia a man abusing a spouse will be killed by his neighbours in true justice
Likewise
Russia:
Documentary about the state of democracy in Russia
Very insightful
There are dolls made from nylon stockings called popiks
They are ugly as fuck and usually have some vulgar traits like big tits or nude/panties-clad bottoms (hence the name, "popa" is "bottom" or "backside", so it's literally dolls with bottoms) but otherwise look like amateurishly made kids' toys
Some people make them and some people even buy them, they became popular in 80s-90s probably [ Their whole existence is a complete mystery for me
Just why
Peter the Great
Like, he is called great for a reason, he changed a course of Russian history drastically, many contemporary things have their roots in Peter's activities
But at the same time he was quite cruel and ruthless, he needlessly destoyed many (cultural, historical) things in his quest of modernising Russia and he didn't give a fuck about how many people will suffer and die because of his whims
And he was an amateur in everything and many of his expensive projects failed
It's still questionable if he did more good or bad
Someone else already said Peter I, so I'm going to go for Tsarina Elizabeth
She didn't do anything egregious like getting thousands of people killed building Petersburg like Peter did; but she personally was a bad person despite her thinking of herself as a kind empress
• She had her nephew, Ivan VI (who had been crowned so he wasn't just a pretender) locked away in a fortress on his own for his entire life since he was a small child, until he was killed in an attempt to free him
• She was so vain she reduced the future Catherine the Great to tears and depression for the sin of looking good at a ball (i.e. better than she looked) - by telling her she was spoiled, withdrawing her allowance and according to some accounts hacking Catherine's hair to a mess with a pair of scissors
• Blamed Catherine for the fact she had no children with her chosen successor Peter, and made her a prisoner in her rooms watched by a abusive married couple who bullied her despite the fact it was Peter who ensured the marriage remained childless
• Started a war with Frederick the Great of Prussia because he made jokes about her being the 'Messalina of the North' (the Roman Empress Messalina was widely considered a debauched whore, sleeping with anything that moved) and that her reign was the "rule of c*nt" (as in, lady parts)
And much more
We have classic "Taras Bulba" by Gogol where cossack Taras kills his son Andriy as a traitor and shame of family because he falls in love with some Polish girl and refuses to fight Poles, wants to stay with her
But Poles are evil and mortal enemies, blood of people calls to be avenged and war is a must, so Taras says "I spawned you - and I will end you too" and does just that
Taras kinda national (fictional) hero too, he sacrifices personal for the sake of his country
A+ parenting too, lol
This, basically
Petersburg alone is built on the bones of at least 30
000 (though some estimates put it at over 100
000) people who died of malaria, lack of food etc
It was literally a swamp when we conquered it from the Swedes
> he didn't give a fuck about how many people will suffer and die because of his whims
This is literally all of the Tsars lol
I don't really think it's fair to describe him as an amateur at everything though (by that logic, so was Catherine - her attempt at changing the law failed, her handling of her husband was quite blatantly an assassination etc)
His education wasn't exactly thorough, and as for cultural things, I'm quite thankful Russia doesn't still have crap like the terem
To be fair though, Andriy betrays his army and steals food from his father and their people before running to his girl's side in the middle of the war
Then Taras's second son is captured and tortured and executed before his eyes by Poles, that son stays loyal to his people to the end
Then Taras turns into a death machine and roams in Poland with the rest of his army killing everything and everyone, and then he caught by Poles and burned alive while saving his army
Fun times
But that catch phrase is what most people remember from all the book usually
It's very possible
We learn something new everyday))
Three mistakes that lead to the civil war and reign of Bolsheviks:
Trying to make monarchy work after the revolution if 1905
Not quitting WW1 after the February revolution
October revolution,
It's always Moscow
Russia is a very unequal and centralized country, and Moscow is like a completely different world
Actually its Sochi
In my opinion, Sochi is way too trashy to even be in top 10
>Do people ever actually visit eastern Russia
Like is it normal to go on vacation over there
As a tourist destination, not much
There's some really great nature there, like Lake Baikal or Kamchatka for example, but they lack tourist infrastructure, and traveling there is way too expensive for most Russians (traveling to other European countries is usually cheaper)
Russia is big, the Moscow-Vladivostok flight is almost the same distance as Moscow-New York
And cities there tend to be pretty boring
>Also it’s a bit surprising there’s not much major development on the eastern coast now that I think about it
The entire Far East with the area equal to 70% of USA is just 8 million people, there is not a single million city there
We simply don't have the population density to get major development
Only the European part of Russia is somewhat decently populated
The question was about what city is growing at a
crazy rate
Have you seen how many development projects lately in Sochi
Which has precisely zero to do with the question
Most of Siberia and Far East are indeed not worth inhabiting
Russia is trying to develop the East coast, but Russia's presence there won't become much larger anytime soon, as there's little incentive for people to permanently move there, and the population of Russia isn't growing either

I just feel so envious that in all other European countries (except of several other unlucky ones) they do have it
You guys have pretty functional government

They wouldn't be here at all if that was true
We usually mark blank pages with a huge Z with the line
Other than that, we use it only in math and it's without
But when it comes to foreign languages, it tends to vary
I write just a simple z, but my German teacher used to write the fancy cursive z with a loop
We have first name, last name, and "patronymic" (???), showing your father's name
You got the word right
Have no fear
I just didnt expect it to be spelt like that
Bet it sounds weird to Dutch people when other Russians address you using your Christian name and patronymic at the same time
We dont
I'm still a bit weirded out by the fact that you can only buy booze from government stores in some Nordic countries
Addressing someone by their last name is a bit rude
That's what teachers and officers do, or what bosses do when they are angry
Strangers call you "young man". When you're introduced, younger Russians give you just their first name
You use them to introduce yourself, you use them to ask about other people, but you don't use them to address other people, unless they are foreigners or underlings
For example, Putin would say, "Rad vas videtj, gospodin Makron" , which the interpreter would repeat as "Je suis content de vous voir, Monsieur Macron", or whatever the proper French for "glad to see you" is
He would also say, "Job tvoju matj, Surkov, kakogo huja
", because Vladislav Jurjević Surkov promised him everything would go just as planned, but Ukraine backed out of the deal they had agreed upon beforehand
We still have people who put [this] ("we could do that again") on their cars
Often times cars made in Germany, or in Russia by Germans
Dude

They have already appropriated Anastasia, please no more princesses from Russia
What about Wilhelmina, a single mother and a crack shot who doesn't want to marry an old Austrian king and become a princess
Well Disney owns Fox now, so she's become a Disney princess
I remember a lesson on it somewhere in school
Maybe also in the country that was the main part of the other side of that war
Out of interest, how is WW2 handled in Hungary
Does it focus on the war in the east
Hungarian internal politics with Horthy
The Holocaust
In fairness, Finland had advantages that you didn't.
I went to school in his early years before he started fucking with the curriculum too much
>And how is it in Russia
I remember someone told be that you call the Great Patriotic War
Not everyone does, but it's a name which gets used enough to be common
When I went to school it was fairly balanced
Nothing was really hidden
The Pact with the Nazis; the Winter War; Germany during the invasion etc
Nowadays, it's faithful enough to the truth it's adequate but it's clever with how it tells the tale
For example, when it comes to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the textbooks will happily admit we made a non-aggression pact but sneakily leave out the secret protocols (splitting Poland and other things) in it
I have no problem remembering the WWII generation, but it makes me a bit uncomfortable sometimes how far it gets taken
Stuff like the '[Immortal Regiment] where people march with photos of their dead relatives is really common now
Regarding the rest of the world, it got a couple of lessons and that was it when I was at school
I don't know how it is right now; but I'd assume it's the same or even less
Not likely
France and the UK only said that so they had an excuse to have troops in Sweden and Norway (to deprive Germany of the raw materials you sold them, and ports to get into the Atlantic)
Unfortunately, Germany beat them to Norway
Leadership was undoubtedly part of it
But if we're looking at it in terms of body count, then the biggest enemy we faced was the weather
More died due to exposure than fighting (helped by consistent Finnish destroying of field kitchens and other stuff like that)
Though I suppose that's again due to poor leadership on our part
None of our neighbors were friendly, but yes
Maybe, maybe not
I don't think it had that big an effect as once the commander in charge was changed and the troops were given proper time to plan and practice, the Finnish defenses didn't last all that long
That works better

The Kremlin and the red square
Great examples
Think our churches are the mot beautiful in the world
Because it's the Muscovite style :P I always kinda thought our architecture was a reflection of the country
Take St Basil's Cathedral for example; it gives the impression of being on the far away horizon if you know what I mean
Compared to say [Aachen Cathedral] which gives the impression of being 'enclosed
They definitely are
I mean, Charlemagne's buried there
:) Hmm, maybe [St Stephen's Cathedral] then

You can have multiple citizenships from births as well
For me English is the best language
I find in it some subtlety
So popular and logical language
I know 3 languages and even my native language isn’t so beautiful
Don't like when people joke about Serbia, Bulgaria, or Belarus
Especially Serbia I think gets an undeserved bad reputation
Tbf what Spain did from 1492 up until 1520s or so seems disgusting even for the time
Columbus wasn't sent back to Spain in chains for nothing
After that it seems like it was more moderate
I don't know how good the Russian course is, but I found French from English quite useful for getting the basics down
I crammed it intensively for the first couple of weeks, and that enabled me to overcome the initial barrier and start to understand some very basic input aimed at learners
Then I moved on to other means of learning the language
It's also good for internalising the grammar basics (like plurals, conjugations, etc
) and as a source of most basic input when you're just starting out
I agree with most of what you said, especially that Duolingo is helpful for introducing yourself to a language
I often hear that "Duolingo won't make you fluent", but why should it
Who said you should be using the same resources and doing the same things at all levels
Every method out there exists with a particular purpose in mind, and Duolingo's purpose is to familiarise you with the basics, not "make you fluent".
As to the Portuguese course being as good as any other, I've actually read that not all of them are created equal
Some are considered very extensive and well-structured like (reportedly) Norwegian, and some were created by people who had no idea about the language and filled the course with ungrammatical or nonsensical translations
And then there's everything in-between
Isn't that because it uses (a lot of) Mexican Spanish though
Yeah, it's the same complaint learners of Russian often post on Reddit
You can usually rearrange the subject, verb and object(s) however you feel like, but apparently Duolingo won't accept anything other than SVO
Well, the French course I was doing had notes attached to each lesson
They explained all the concepts and rules necessary to complete them
Sure, I also looked into other resources to learn about grammar in a more structured way, but I'm talking more about drilling/practicing rather than acquiring a theoretical knowledge of certain concepts
I guess you're right, though it should probably be obvious that you can't become fluent just by drilling tests
It definitely has its advantages when its scope and limitations are taken into account
Oh okay then, I didn't like Duo for Spanish but now I'm certain I'll be using something else, AssiMil or something
Yeah, I've heard of a course on some rare language that was apparently created by someone who didn't speak English, and none of the English translations made any sense
Don't remember what it was, though
Good luck with your Russian btw
uncle Vasya from the next entrance, legends say that he can drink 10 liters of vodka in one gulp
But jokes aside I don't think that we have any local folklore monsters, maybe some legends about some psychos but not monsters
EDIT: I was meant to say that we don't have any modern folklore monsters like bigfoot or chupacabra
Zmei Gorynich - a russian folklore dragon or serpent, or sometimes a human-like character with dragon-like traits
Usually multi-headed and can be killed only by cutting off his heads
I don't mean we don't have old folklore creatures, I mean we don't have any monsters like bigfoot and other urban legends that we can specify the location of

Prince St
Alexander Nevsky who defended Russia against catholic northern crusaders (swedes and baltic germans)
Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin: raised Russian people to expel foreign occupants during the Times of Trouble
For Russia, we have a fair few
* Saint Alexander Nevsky (literally meaning "*of the Neva*") stopped the conquest eastwards of the Swedes (at the aforementioned Neva river), and the German Teutonic Knights near Pskov (it was one-sided enough to be called a 'massacre on the ice')
Unfortunately, he was a willing helper in the Mongol subjugation of the principalities
* Kozma Minin and Dmitri Pozharskiy (I'm putting them in the same bullet point because they're intertwined) were respectively, a meat trader from Nizhny Novgorod and a minor nobleman from Moscow
They're famous because they formed an integral part of the army (Minin recruited the men and Pozharsky led it) which cleared the Polish from the Kremlin so that Mikhail Romanov (who's important to the next one on the list) could be crowned Tsar
* Ivan Susanin wasn't a nobleman
He was a simple peasant, but, when the Poles invaded in order to try and foist their choice for Tsar on us during the "Time of Troubles" (after Ivan Grozny died); he was asked to lead the Poles to where Mikhail Romanov (later the first Romanov Tsar) was hiding with his mother
He agreed
and then promptly lead the Poles deep into the woods where they became lost, while his son in law ran to Mikhail and told him to flee
* Alexander Suvorov, is probably the finest soldier Russia has ever produced
In his entire career, he didn't lose a single battle (over 50 fought) and he's mostly responsible for why Yekaterina Velikaya (Catherine the Great) has lots of conquests to her name
He didn't just fight the Turks and Polish rebels, he successfully erased nearly all of Napoleon's conquests in Italy and fought off a French force four times the size of his in Switzerland while withdrawing
* Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) was the Tsar who turned us from the strange, eastern kingdom of Muscovy into the Russian Empire, one of the Great Powers of Europe
There's a story about how when he was a child and out with a non-Russian friend of his, he found an abandoned Dutch ship sitting in a warehouse if I remember correctly
He was fascinated by it and asked for it to be restored
He was unusual in that he was excited by the west and wanted to import as much as he could to make his patrimony like the western kingdoms
And he did
Probably the biggest indicator of his legacy is the city I live in: Saint Petersburg, which he won from Charles XII (who even today is revered as Sweden's second greatest warrior king after Gustavus Adolphus)
France - Arnaud Beltrame
Cops who died two years ago after exchanging place with hostage of terrorist
Yes
Beltrame is the first that came to my mind
I would add also Ivan Susanin [ , he is often mentioned in jokes but still a hero
tl;dr he led squad of Poles into a deep forest pretending to help and was killed by them in Time of Troubles
We kinda had almost repeat in WWII [ A grandpa led Nazi troops into an ambush and became an oldest hero of USSR post mortem
But he is not widely known
That war just wasn't about victory, it was about our very survival, our existance as people, not even as nation
Nazis did such things to our population on occupied territories that people were willing to self-sacrifice to the end but get them out because the alternative was to be killed anyway
Hitler clearly stated that population of USSR are not humans to him and there shouldn't be any pity
So troops acted accordingly [ We just couldn't surrender and wait for rescue
So from WWII we have so many heroes that a full list would take a kilometer
There were collaborants too though, Nazis tortured and starved Soviet prisoners of war to force them to collaborate, so some died refusing and some agreed
Two or my great grandfathers fought in WWII, one grandfather was a logistics officer managing some part of the Chernobyl containment and cleanup effort
My grandpa was involved in Soviet politics in Latin America quite heavily
My great granfather died in WW2
My great grandparents took part in WW2
Great grandma was a nurse, her future husband was an artillery officer
During the war he was demoted to penalty battalion for leaving their cannons under enemy surrounding (not executed because he saved his subordinates by doing that)
Later he was restored in his rank when he lead the charge into enemy trenches and secured an important position during forcing the river Dnepr in Ukraine
He took part in storming Berlin by the end of the war and had a successful military career back home until retirement
His parade uniform easily weighted around 5 kg from all the regalia, he wore it with pride every Victory Day (May 9th)
Another great grandpa served in a tank crew, but I don't know much about his story, met him only once when I was little
Go back more than a few generations and everyone's related to everyone
So I assume I'm related to every significant figure in English history prior to the year 1500 or so
Once, after the fall Byzantine, I think
Interesting=) Does this mean that if Finland would join the USSR and the Bolsheviks lost the Yakut revolt then Yakutia became the last heir of the Roman Empire
Wow, that's really crazy=)
Russian words on the left and their real meanings on the right:
* smoking > tuxedo
* autostop > hitch-hiking
* killer > hitman
*  [face control] > a policy of a nightclub to let or not let you in based on the way you look
Happy end
Yeah, we have those coaches as well
especially in brainwashing business environments
Same for everything in your list except *footing*, although we normally use meeting to mean a public protest
Videoclip - music video
Haha, I will start using *randomovy* in Russian now
It will spice things up a little bit because we normally say *randomny*.
We have fichas too
Yeah, thanks for pointing out
Russian sources list it as a pseudo-anglicism without providing the origin of the word, so that's why I thought it should be there
Killer in English just means someone/something that kills, but in Russian it means someone who is paid to kill people
Do you use it in Polish this way
Smoking in English means doing a ciggie, but not part of your suit
The other two words don't exist in English
I was surprised to know too
We always use a Russian word for jogging, but I've just googled *footing* (adopted for Russian) and found an example when it means jogging
Yeah, btw I had to google that a couple of months ago because I wasn't sure it would still be clip in English
Yeah, but we don't mean [this]
We also say *na randome* with the prepositional case of *random* (we have the prepositional instead of locative)
It literally means "on random", although the English idiom is "at random".
We can't, but it doesn't stop people going there
The government makes up shit to criminalise particular protests
That's gonna be a great language exchange
let's see how we bring them closer together after they have been diverging for over a 1000 years
The standard word in Russian is *sluchajny*, but like you said, it doesn't have that special vibe
*sluchajny* for random has an English sound as in *church*. Actually, the standard word for "listen
" would be *slushaj* (*sh* as in English *ship*)
But you can also say *sluhaj* and be understood
That's considered dialectal/colloquial, and my grandmother sometimes uses it
Yeah, I'm also impressed by Polish and other Slavic languages too
I want to learn one at some point in the future and I'm thinking about Polish or Serbian (= Croatian = Bosnian = ~~Macedonian~~ Montenegrin)  because these two are the biggest
But I will probably start with Polish because the grammar is more similar to Russian (shit, they're almost identical
) and it's easier to understand spoken Polish than spoken Serbian for some reason
We call it the same thing pronounced with a Russian accent, but I had to google it because I'm bad at history and I don't know this term
If you mean unification in general, it would be *objedinenie*.
Never use "usual" street taxi especially at airports, rail terminals and so on
Their prices are unbelievably high when they saw a foreign tourist
Always use online apps for taxi (Uber, Gett, Yandex Taxi) instead of
Their prices are fixed, predictable and low
The lost wallet scam
You see someone drop a wallet, pick it up, chase after them, hand it back, the person starts to thank you, then "notices it misses a few high value notes". A few "convenient" witnesses claim they saw you take them out
DON'T TRUST GOPNIKS
They are tricksters that want to steal your money for Vodka
Every month or so I see a Gopnik approach a tourist asking them to 'see their phone' so they can make a 'call' but really they just run off, or if they're brave enough straight up mug you
They aren't funny "cheeki breeki cyka blyat xD" they are gangsters and thugs
[Our train companies are just a racket]
Seriously, though, it's cheaper to fly to Scotland than to take a train
Never heard of it actually
Sounds funny because in my hometown (and in many other Russian cities)
most buses are used buses brought from Germany
PS I know you said about personal cars but anyway
Except countries with lack of taxi online apps
Turkey for example
They also have food delivery and carsharing
Now it's often a card forgotten in an ATM
Actually, Yandex bought Uber's Russian division, so there's no more independent Uber in Russia, Uber app will get you Yandex taxi
I think there's a bigger factor causing many Russians to travel to Belarus: for a lot of Russians, Belarus is one of few countries they are allowed to visit due to having security clearance
We played knuckles, palm slap and break the chain as well, but the stupidest game was "the last one to run across the street in front of a car wins".
Usually I ask if they wanna hear a piece of a poem in Russian
Almost every time the answer is yes
So I tell them that short verse from Tvardovsky' poem "Vasili Tyorkin" which I remember from school
Переправа, переправа!
Берег левый, берег правый,
Снег шершавый, кромка льда...
Кому память, кому слава,
Кому темная вода,
Ни приметы, ни следа.
That's an amazing poem, very melodic
Tvardovsky puts the language of plain folks into beautiful hymn dedicated to those russian soldiers who went through the horror of WW2
No politics though
It's just one of the most beautiful representations of my language
Sounds like Kazakhstan is finlandized by two countries at once
That justice will be as swift as that for people like [ .
> value honor, respect and personal liberties above brute force, influence and wealth
Every country in the world claims to do it, but in reality none of them do
We've switched to democracy once
Not so long ago, we even gave independence to many smaller countries one of which was Lithuania, giving up 1/3 of the land we had
This switch turned us into ruins
Complete chaos
We were betrayed by those who promisedus better life and safety
No way our people will try to change to democracy again
Samara is the largest Russian city that isn't famous for anything
Smaller Toljatti/Togliatti nearby is the home of Lada and is more famous
I would say that all cities except Moscow and St
Petersburg are unknown outside post-USSR countries
Russia has 15 cities over 1M people, although there are only 33 cities in Europe with more than a million people, of which 8 are from Russia
There's also Lienz, which is completely obscured by Linz
Yeah, we don't call them Samara here
It's number eight, number nine, number ninety-nine or just the chisel
Avstro-Vengerskaya imperiya
Balkan Bosch
Which is exact translation of Austro-Hungarian empire
Avstrovengriya
We are crippled by propagandas, talking back to each other for no reason, disrespect ourselves
That there are a lot of bears on the streets
"Belka". It's easy to pronounce if you can pronounce the soft (palatalised) B.
Dunno, foreign policy is the smallest of the sins of our government, really
I mean there many not optimal choices, but comparing to the internal policies they implement, diplomacy isn't that big of a deal
Crimean annexation is kinda sensible from Russian pov
Unfortunately it facilitated Putin to establish full on dictatorship, but from geopolitical point of view it had sense for Russia to annex the peninsula
Although I would rather give the locals a legit referendum
But the end result would hardly be different
As for Georgia, Saakashvily was a cocky fool and fell into a trap
But it was he who decided to use force to reincorporate breakaway republics, not Russia
I'm more opposed to the war in Donbass and playing nice with Chinese in Central Asia
Syrian affair is also kinda dubious, but it is too early to say for sure
Time will show
It is rather irrelevant whether Estonia has low or high support for NATO in a grand scheme of things
As to cooperation, the government tries to cooperate with Germany and China, two most important neighbors
I would rather have good relations with Ukraine as well, but this ship has already sailed, unfortunately
Good relations with other neighboring countries are optional for the well being of Russia
According to your logic every country should stop influencing other counties
Although it is a nice idealistic position, real world doesn’t work like this
Either you shape your geopolitical environment or it shapes you
I think conflict in Ukraine is more of a road block in Russia-German rapprochement
As well as the fact that current Russian economy is in so bad shape that we cannot really offer that much as partners
Therefore there is no political will in both Paris and Berlin to change current status quo
But it’s rather naive to think that political elites in Poland and the Baltics would be able to indefinitely resist political pressure from major EU members, if one day they decided to change their Russian policy
Especially if UK really leaves the EU
But it’s all very theoretical
I’m pretty sure that Russia beneficial as an ally to Germany would also be beneficial to the Eastern Europeans as a neighbor
I love you too, darling
My love is enough for us two both
Have a good evening
There is so much more to being a decent man than having or not having certain political affiliations, ma dude
Where did I say that I support offensive wars
Yeah, it's very common
For most students it's just wasted money imo
They often do so because 1) they are lazy to practice on their own, even though there are innumerable preparation materials all over the internet; 2) they think hiring s tutor is like a magic button that will bring you the highest results even if you aren't doing anything; 3) they think tutors are better than school teachers just because they are tutors, which isn't always so; 4) it's their helicoptering parents who hire 10 tutors to keep their child busy 24/7; etc
But it's good money for tutors
The average price is around 15€ per hour depending on the subject
Some of my uni group mates started tutoring maths, physics and IT and charged ≈23€ despite zero experience in tutoring
Why
Because parents are ready to pay
In my country the difference in difficulty between the material that the school curriculum offers and the final exam is tremendously high
Most high graders visit private tutors (in russian they're called "репетитор")
Doing that during other years of school except the final one is much less common, though it is possible that you meet several people who do this if you attend a random class in an average school
Usually that's done, so that children won't fall back in their studies and will for sure catch up with the information that the school course provides
Were else we should to store them
Russia: whatever the word for coffee is masculine or neuter gender
Naturally, it feels like it should be neuter, as words ending by 'e' are always neuter
However, for some historical reasons, it's 'officially correct' to regard it as if it was masculine
And since any adjectives (and sometimes verbs) should be inflected corresponding to a subject's gender in Russian, you can quite often hear people correcting 'incorrect' endings pronounced by other people
Suprisingly it is whether we should call shawarma “shaverma” or “shaurma”
I would add a swear word "blyad" and a holywar about "blyat" being separate word or just incorrect spelling
"Blyad" originally means "whore" but is often used as something like "oh fuck
", so some people argue that "blyad" is a noun and "blyat" is an interjection
It gets annoying actually when grammar nazis of both kinds turn random thread into an epic battle over a swear word
Brandon Flowers should be granted peerage
I'll prefer a plane over 4+ hours on a day train or 12+ hours on an overnight train
Short flights with all the time needed before and after the flight require about 3-4 hours, so it's just a matter of time spent travelling
Though in practice there's rarely a choice, often something (might be train, might be plane) is much cheaper, or only one of them is available
There always that "Cold blue" filter
Russian speaking very strange too
Vodka, ushanka, balalayka, etc
More of video games
But I feel like every call of Duty portrays us as evil war crime committing warlords
And we are, but what country isn't? Like the Us has committed multiple atrocities, but we're always the bad guys ;-;
As for movies, pretty much the same
As either evil/corrupt (especially during Soviet era timelines) and or poor 3rd world gopnik trash
Which I admit is kinda true
As well as the whole subculture of Slavaboos on the internet that think 'Russia greatest country, putin good, Russia is so cool
Cyka blyat XDD'
I've visited the west a couple of times and I get either
Mistrust, or some dumbass saying 'tee hee cyka blyat hahahah'. Fortunately not everyone is an asshole so this does not not happen every time
Oh, easier to remember what do western movie portray correct=) In all Hollywood movies, Russia is frozen Morder, lands of pure evil, where nobody behaves like real people
People are either unreasonably aggressive, or cowardly and clogged
Sometimes both
I think Russia is the most caricatured country in movies
The sky is always grey
It is always snowy
Everyone forgot how to use Name+Patronymic and only says tovarish
The setting of the movie Age of Ultron looks like it's set somewhere around Slovenia or Croatia
Wish that Slavaboos would appreciate things like the Bolshoy Teatr, Kreml', etc, as opposed to just sharing memes about Putin
Well, the sky is always grey
There was a huge scandal about it
Although “evil Ruskies doing evil stuff for the sake of doing evil stuff” trope is pretty common and people are usually apathetic about it and even like it sometimes new CoD rubbed in very wrong places
Namely that it portrays an ongoing conflict where real Russian servicemen are involved and the game portrays them as animals that commit war crimes for breakfast, lunch and dinner
On top of it, those war crimes they commit ARE ACTUAL AMERICAN war crimes that were committed by the US forces in Iraq
Plus there are many cultural tropes that are also go beyond what is acceptable by Russian standards
My favorite one being a dialog between two Russians that call protagonists barbarians because they are led by a female
You know, those backwater Russians, never heard about females on frontlines
Pretty indignant
And then a video of our PMC's dismembering a bound guy in Syria leaked
Nah man, just blame it on Austria lol
It is different parts of the same process
Propaganda as it is according to Goebbels
Portray the enemy as subhuman so that no one feels sympathy for him
America and Britain have succeeded in it
We are almost used to such an attitude toward us but it sometimes make us annoying
We have a special term for this klyukva
Sometimes it give us a lot of lulz
Now - never
Only places where modern Russians say “tovarisch” is military and police
Service members are required to say “Tovarisch [rank]” while talking to a superior
Like “Tovarisch captain, ask permission to take a dump”. But then again, no one will say “Hello, Tovarisch”. That was super weird even during commie times
Formal way of starting a conversation is by using Name+Patronymic, like “Oleg Ivanovich, can we talk
”. It was used in Imperial Russia, in USSR and is still used now
I find it really funny that the Russian community kinda embraced the trope and now meme-ing pretty hard on the CoD plot with videos about J-12 guy and stuff
Pretty horrible in the context of the game, but I guess empowering in the cultural scope
Bf3 had surprisingly good SP, looking back to it now
It had competent plot with not that critically many clichés, good levels, memorable moments
I replayed Super Hornet like maybe 10 times
DICE really droped the ball in later games
And all units retained red banners
It's more of a military tradition from the height of Russian military power rather than something associated with the commies
I was about 7-10 years old, but most children learn earlier
But yeah, I also learnt to ice-skate last winter at 20 when everyone else here is *born* with it
And I still can't rollerblade
Well, I failed when I was trying as a kid, but maybe I could now if I tried again
At least, that's how it worked with my ice-skating
I learned to ride as a kid
Since 4-5 years old
I didn’t ride in my teen years, but I start commute on my singlespeed (now fixed gear) bike 2 years ago (I’m 25 y.o.) and I love it
It is dangerous sometimes here in Russia, but I’m totally ok with it, because I’m russian
I think late 1800s in the Balkans would be the perfect setting for a video game
Please tell me what nicknames do you have for Russians
>Swołocz
This is a common insult, at least in Russian
Why does this apply specifically to the Russians
Now i understand, thanks
We were taught pretty a lot about WWII, I'd say almost the whole year there was nothing but this war on History classes
Also when I was younger veterans used to come and tell about it
There's pretty much difference between western and Russian approach to teaching WWII
First of all I'd say here we are believed to be if not the only one, but main makers of victory
The whole western front operation (D-day and everything) is viewed mostly as an act of treachery than help ('the allies didn't take any action until they realised that the USSR is capable to free whole Europe up to English Channel
Of course they didn't want to lose an opportunity to be victors and gain influence on western Europe and Germany'.)
Secondly, of course we are taught about Holocaust, but I wouldn't say that Jews suffered more than Russians or Poles
Almost everyone in my class had at least one relative who was moved to a death or a concentration camp
So I was taught that Russians (the USSR citizens in this case) suffered the most in this war
We were taught a lot things about WWII (from June 22, 1941 till May 9, 1945 - we call it The Great Patriotic War) - battles, generals' actions and great strategic moves, personal stories of notable persons, political situation, Stalin's actions etc
Also we were taught about Soviet operation in the Far East
BTW there was no operations except Pearl Harbor attack and Hirosima/Nagasaki bombing in which the Allies were involved
I tried to write down everything what I believed would be interesting for non-Russians
Anyway feel free to ask me anything
>Firstly, she was dead sure that in USA everybody believes, that their country by oneself won WWII and saved the whole world (have never seen any American who would think that way)
Well, that just means that you have never seen any American
Pitching in with a different perspective and more emphasis on why your particular teacher matters
Our class had a teacher with a penchant for her students crafting their own theories and explanations to challenge her views, so the consensus we arrived at was pretty much that USSR was biding for time and attempting to secure as much territory from potential Reich rule before the looming war
Interestingly enough, we also covered late 1920s industrial cooperation between USSR and Germany in circumvention of post-WWI international regulations pretty well
Pitching in again with a different teacher and different experience
It was pretty much "territorial acquisition to shift the border away from vulnerable SPb" and "a massive failure thanks to the gutted officer corps that had no idea what they were doing".
Late Imperial Russia
There is a meme “Россия которую мы потеряли”, Russian that we lost
Some nationalist and unsurprisingly current government, while talking about late Empire, concentrate on “culture”, developing economy and “patriotism”, while neglecting obvious flaws of the dying system
Cold War era USSR
Once again, many people prefer to concentrate on the amount of influence and power USSR had, as well as good standards of living of Brezhnev era, small amount of social problems (comparing to present day) and developing infrastructure while ignoring all the deficiencies of the system and repressions
Pretty much same here, but I also have heard some stories from my grandfather about how he ate wood grouses, black grouses, pheasants, etc (cause he lived in a village for a long time and was a game hunter)
I wouldn't say it's the same
In Russia, duck and goose, despite being part of the traditional cuisine, are extremely rarely eaten these days
But turkey is quite popular
Idk, we had duck as a 2021 New Year dish :P
You can even find them in supermarkets like Lenta
edit: but speaking in general, chicken and turkey are the most popular birds definetely
That's the point
In Ukraine, it's more or less an everyday dish, as far as I understand
Over here, duck can only be found in some supermarkets, and there's never a wide selection of cuts like with chicken or other meats
Goose is even more difficult to find
[Norilsk] I guess
To be fair you can't really call it an ugly city, because it has been built literally on the edge of the world in very severe weather conditions by lots of architects and urbanists from Saint Petersburg
So I'd call it beautiful in its own, unique way, that is not that easy to understand
Actually, they’re slowly rebuilding it
Actually, Norilsk does not have such a large permanent population
Most people working there in a shift
We call it Vakhta
They work month there and month they rest in their real home
Norilsk has a large factory and the largest nickel deposits that are there always a lot of work and money
[Yep, there have been some sparse projects happening in the region,] fingers crossed that the trend will continue
Certainly
The extensive restoration projects being done in the Netherlands, St
Pete’s, Hungary, and Poland are truly things worthy of admiration
Seeing something that the world had initially lost brought back to life is just so exhilarating, as it is true architectural justice
Nah
Muscovite accent is very weak, almost indistinguishable from standard Russian, and even though Siberians say we stretch our vowels, it's hard to mock Muscovites while surrounded by them in Moscow, even if you're a tough Siberian
Verbs *одеть* (odet', to dress [somebody]) and *надеть* (nadet', to put on [an item of clothing])
*-тся/-ться* (-tsya/-t'sya) at the end of reflexive verbs
The former one is the present third person form, the latter one is the infinitive
For example, *бояться* (boyat'sya) means *to be afraid*, *они боятся* (oni boyatsya) means *they are afraid*. The pronunciation is exactly the same, that's why many people make this mistake
ь in the endings of 3rd person verbs and absence of ь in the endings of infinitives
The wrong amount of н in the suffixes of different words (sometimes it should be one, sometimes two)
Mistakes with particles (there are rules when they are written with the word, separately or divided by hyphen)
Commas
Wrong spelling of the words with unstressed vowels
The rule is indeed easy, but it doesn't make it a less common mistake
The first mistake can also be avoided by using the simple mnemonic: "одеть Надежду, надеть одежду" (*translit*. odet' Nadezhdu, nadet' odezhdu; *trans
* To dress Nadezhda, to put on clothes)
Some people just don't want to think when they write
Well, you have to remember that the prefixes are the opposite
Also, it uses the fact that—unlike "одеть одежду" which is a common mistake—"надеть Надежду" sounds *really wrong* to a native Russian speaker
My impressions, in 1998, were "This place is not suited for normal human life"
But I have been to Manhattan only
When I was a little boy, about 10 years old, I had a  remote control car
I used to play with it at home only
But once I decided to show it to my friend and play with outside
One stranger boy had come to us and begun to ask questions
After some time he took my car and run away
It was only 2 times by parents had some items stolen (no violence involved)
How do you live after that
There's been many cases here when people invested in a property that is still in its planning stage, but then it turned out to be a scam
I don't think that happens now because there's more control over it lately
At least they gave you the pen
Here, if you give someone a pen, it is an unspoken rule that they never return it
If for a minute, they are supposed to return it
But if you give them a pen for a couple of lessons or the entire day, then forget about it
It's not rude to ask about it, but it most likely won't help because they will have lost it or will "return it the next day".
Россия (Русь) матушка - mother Russia
With tint of sentiment
Отечество - Fatherland
Sounds quite solemn
Not identic to Russia itself, so can be used by any nation towards their homeland
Родина - kin's land
Sounds neutral
Can be used by anyone, not only Russians
Отчизна - same as Fatherland but slightly old-fashioned and poetic
Родина-мать - motherland of our kin or something like that
Sounds pompous
Nowadays the second and third are the most common
Russia is the mother whereas the land itself is the land of our fathers and kin
Pretty simple
In Russian you've got *both* "rodina" (motherland) and "otetchestvo" (fatherland)
Which are both used in similar contexts
Pretty much the same thing with Russian родина (rodina)
It just means person's home country without any specific connection to Russia
You can hear news like "some tourists finally returned to their rodina after being trapped in another country for some reason".
Just like clling Russia "Motherland"
Native
That's what every new house gets by default these days
Not all of them are two-hinged, but usually they are as it's a cheap option
That's a very interesting fact
In Eugene Onegin we also have a mention of a window in German-owned bakery that is called vasisdas
Can anyone suggest me Youtube channel where I can see interviews of famous people
In English, of course
I’m into cycling and especially fixed gear and I love nature so I really enjoy recent videos of PRPLXBLZ
Vdud
This is the channel of Russian man who makes interviews with famous people
For example, politicians, musicians, actors
I can say that his interviews are masterpieces
He makes huge work and I appreciate it
Yuri Dud is a young journalist
Also, he released some documentary films on his channel
Some of them have English subtitles
And if you learn Russian, his channel will exactly help you
It's sad that they've stopped, but I can see why - they've exhausted the concept
Still rewatching Carnivorous Christmas Table every December religiously, probably their best episode
It's not old fashioned
It's daily greeting for men
Very common
We always shake hands as a greeting and when leaving
Every fucking break in school I shake hands with friends from another class and at morning with my
Very common
That even necessarily
I noticed that I don't always shake hands with closer friends or friends whom  I see often, which is reciprocal, even though we never discussed it
It would feel kinda weird, but I don't know why
Well, a new citizen may have learnt to shake hands with the servant, but that doesn't mean they will acquire this habit afterwards
I see what you mean and I feel awkward as a Russian when that's happening
Cats personally, cats nationally (by a huge margin)
We have the biggest number of cats per capita in the world afaik
I like dogs more but I think that cats are more popular
Well, it's cultural, cats have been considered good luck in Russia for centuries and even letting a cat into a new house before the humans move in is said to bring good luck
They have always been favored pets in Russia, maybe they just fit us more in a cultural sense, those arrogant assholes lol
Also, it may have something to do with living conditions, most people live in apartments in relatively dense urban areas so having a dog is a pain in the ass
Cats are group animals too
Stray cats live in groups
For Russia, the full list can be quite long
Despite the fact that only "Russian" is the official language in the whole country, there are other 35 national languages that have official state in different regions (since Russia is a Federation) and over 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today
Vepsian - lesser known Finnic language
Balachka - language of the Cossacks
Siberian Polish - mostly dead language from people deported there during Russian Empire that for some odd reason liked it and didn't go home
And also ZF (dirigibles and gearboxes)
People know ABB, though
Overcurrent protection switches by ABB are common
Oh, right, I mixed up my Bodensee towns
Do you not maintain electric lines inside your apartment/house yourself
Jesus Christ
What about plumbing
Or actually building an extension to your house
>Public transportation in Ukraine is shit
Even in Kyiv
I live in Moscow which is about 900yo, and Moscow center is all about history
They also dig a lot (subway and other construction stuff) so permanently find something here and there
Literally nothing aside from “EU exists”. Not even much bullshit on the state tv
They occasionally mention EU in some way or another, sometimes slightly stirring the picture to cast shade at it, and that’s about it
I usually pay with bank card
Social card in Moscow doubles as a monthly pass (with subway included, around 8$), credit card and an ID for social benefits
Rest use Troika card, in which you can put either a deposit or a pre-paid abonement
Almost every bus/tram/trolley has wireless receiver to pay with card or NFC
Just don't ask me stupid questions after you've heard something about Russia in the news
I have a normal human life just like other people on the planet
Any political, like "Do you (option: Do Russians) like Putin
" or too much personal like "What's you salary
Well, don't you have a joke like this
\- Hey John, why are you so good with chicks
\- Ok Bob, when I meet a chick I just ask: "Would you please fuck with me
\- But John, that's the way you get a punch in the face
\- Well, sometimes you got punched and sometimes you fuck
>Don't and I repeat don't use that one (swear) word you know in Polish
Ha, you know what
First time I heard that word (in combination with  *mać* ) was when I was in school, soviet times, watching a movie "*Seksmisja"* (that somehow didn't had 18+ limitation)
It sounds funny in Russian, also offensive, but quite
exoctic
Do I look like an American spy to you to hang out with grizzlies
Lol
Not authentic enough
Everyone should've been wearing an Adidas tracksuit
Frankly speaking, thanks God, it doesn't sound bad being converted into euros as well, but there actually two sides: some people think those Russians (Moscowites) who can afford travel to Europe are rich, and quite opposite: Russians have this GDP per capita and therefore are poor
So answering the question may insult either :^-)))
>It wasn't translated
It was multi-voice translated of course (or even dubbed -- don't remember)
But that very loud exclamation in Polish was not silenced so everyone hear it
> Actually, I think the way it was used in Seksmisja was great
Yes, that was applied quite understandable and emotionally right way
After watching the movie, we were discussing -- "Hey did you hear what he said
That's how they curse, hahaha"
Kinda related: I’ve heard that during the Chechen wars, “Chekh” (or “Czech) was one of the slang terms for Chechens among our troops
In Russia we get a new law that obligstes shops to clearly mark dairy productd if they contain milk fat replacers
And I see those labels in my local shops
Not sure how it helps))) And my personal favorite thing we have pretty cold July and I hope August))
We're finally switching to electronic nationwide IDs instead of internal paper passports
The process should start in 2020 and be over by 2022
Some may not deem this positive — depends on one's level of surveillance state paranoia
We may have the most nuclear weapons in the world
In Russia you don’t have positive news
That’s it, you just don’t.
Belarussians, rise up
We'd keep stabbing Ukraine in the leg under the table after swiping all of the meat off their plate; pretend Poland isn't there and try and hang around with Belarus, Romania and Serbia
Russia would get drunk and start talking about how good it was under communism
Russia coming to the Baltic countries table
And then happily cycle home despite having more than a few beers
We each steal half your dinner and let you pay for it
With knives in your both hands
You answered your own question
> Stop stealing from my plate
Never
(ง'̀-'́)ง  (In all seriousness, if I had it my way -- we'd never have even tried
It hasn't been worth what's come since
My experience with Polish people says otherwise
Though granted, they were drunk
Greece and the Balkans please
Serbian and Bosnian meat dishes are awesome
[Hmm]
No, THAT SHOULD BE FRANCE
I can literally imagine all the Latin countries gifting a bottle of wine to each other and acting like they're touched, and then tipping all of it down the toilet when they get home
What about with Turkey
Buckfast tastes like shit, and I've drank some really suspect stuff over the years
That Russia is European
Obvs highly subjective but don't group us in with euro lot
>She honestly believed and thought that up to 80-90% of dutch men were gay
Apparently because of all the gay propaganda we have to endure in NL we all turned gay and the dutch public has to pay us to mate or we go extinct
I think she was joking with you
Cause otherwise this story sounds completely unbelievable to me, it's just too ridiculous
Leaving everything else aside, you probably met this 18 year old girl outside of Russia and you were talking English with her, right
This is not the demographic that would seriously believe this kind of stuff
Hell, this isn't even what Russian state tv would be broadcasting about the Netherlands anyway
Why is it called Burglaria then
>could relate a bit
Серьезно? Это ж совершенно клюквенный рассказ.
Asians, most of whom are in-denial
*To be fair*, this still reads like a fantasy to me
And, uh, I do have an idea of what our state tv has to offer, "80-90% of dutch men were gay
Apparently because of all the gay propaganda we have to endure in NL we all turned gay and the dutch public has to pay us to mate or we go extinct" is not it
Not like 18 year olds are intently soaking up those political tv shows anyway
Seriously, the only way this story becomes believable to me is if she was pulling his leg
Otherwise, nope
The fact that this is so highly upvoted with no critical thought at all is upsetting to me
Looks like people are simply going "haha, those dumb Russian animals will believe anything".
>But I distinctly remember during the Ukrainian revolt that Russian media first went with "they are degenerates and homosexuals", and when that didn't work (because how could homosexuals be so brave
I'm not sure, what you're trying to say here
That Russian media (who exactly
channel one
rossiya
) first claimed that those protestors camped out on the maidan were gay
Er, right
I'm sure you can provide evidence of this claim
Cause google isn't helping me here
Again, you guys have some strange caricaturistic ideas about what Russian propaganda puts out
Like this hilarious story about 90% of Ducth men being gay due to homosexual propaganda and society having to pay them to mate
People here swallow up this simplistic bullshit, because they will believe anything about Russians
But no, this isn't what Russia state media is actually trying to indoctrinate us with
I really liked the song "Sisters" by Pain of Salvation — the melody, transition to chorus, Gildenlöw's vocals — but never paid much attention to lyrics, enjoying scarcely perceptible motifs of sadness and loss
And then I finally got to read the actual lyrics
Yeah, Daniel, thanks for ruining otherwise perfect song
I guess this is more about not knowing the cultural context of a song, but kne of the funniest sights I've seen in my life took place one evening in Russia at some seedy bar (the dark kind of place you go when you're already drunk) at 2am
YMCA came on and every big butch Russian guy in the joint started singing along and doing the dance with a great deal of enthusiasm
They didn't know it's a gay anthem
Yes
Camps is where most of Russians try their first alcohol and have first sex
Yes I went every summer
Mostly to South Russia and Ukraine
Where do you find free camps
I hadn't seen them for ages
All camps I see are so fucking expensive
Once a year
The recommendation is twice per year, I suppose
I always plan to follow this recommendation, but continue to find reasons not to go
Capital punishment was abolished in Russia in 1997, as one of the key conditions for joining the Council of Europe
It still has significant support among the population (about 50%), and there are many politicians and other public people openly expressing support for reestablishing it
Capital punishment wasn't completely abolished in Russia yet, but in 1996 a moratorium was placed (a demand from Council of Europe in order to accept Russia)
There are five crimes in which capital punishment could have been used if not for this moratorium, and as far as I know, all five crimes are either very heinous types of murder (such as genocide) or murders of special people (such as authorities)
Polls show that many people would support returning death penalty
First, we've actually just got 10 days off due to COVID (or that's just how I understand it)
Second, yes, we'd get a day off on Monday either way
It’s a day off in Russia, yes
And for many people this whole week is off, but that depends on the employer
It is in Russia
Also next four days are - but not for everyone
Schools and those who work for government will have days off
Well, here it's normal to take a bath or a shower at least once a day, and many people do that twice a day (in the morning and at night)
And we're a pretty cold country for half of the year
In summer, I'll normally take a third shower in the middle of the day if I happen to be near home, but I don't know if many people do the same
If we're talking about actually taking a full bath, I indulge myself a few times a week, and that seems to be something that most of my family do as well (up to grandparents on both sides of the family), but afaik most people don't really care for soaking
I'd say North Caucasus in general and Chechnya in particular
That place just feels eerie and dangerous
I've never even met anyone, who would seriously consider going to Chechnya
Other Caucasian regions aren't that scary really
We just joke about them mostly, although those jokes can often get racist
Also Moscow and Muscovites
I feel like half the country hates us, another half laughs at us, all while a third half wants to live here
Funny thing though, many Muscovites themselves look down on Moscow
It varies, but generally no
To me only Chechnya seems foreign
Often it's quite on the contrary, many people perceive regions that are not part of Russia as "ours". Usually these are the same people who say it's okay to attack other countries and steal their land because "it was ours in the first place".
Moscow metropolitan area (Moscow + Moscow Oblast) - 20 mln, about 14% of total Russian population
In the beginning of 20th century the population of Moscow was a bit over 1 million, and since then Moscow is the melting pot of Russia with lots of opportunities and crazy competition
GDP per capita is the highest in Russia and the standards of living is closer to Western Europe than to the rest of Russia
Petersburg - 5 mln
The capital of Russian Empire
Founded by Peter The Great in 1703 on lands conquered from the Swedes 18 years before the peace treaty that ended the war
Today St
Petersburg is considered as the culture capital of Russia, and the second city of Russia in all other aspects
Residents consider themselves as clever people of high culture, which is true to some degree
Novosibirsk - 1,6 mln
Industrial city with scientific research centers and academic institutions in Academgorodok district (founded in 1950s)
Novosibirsk, unlike Moscow and St
Petersburg, is a subsidized region that receives more from the federal budget than it gives
Moscow (12 506 468)
Petersburg (5 351 935)
Novosibirsk (1 612 833)
Novosibirsk is known for being a city full of intelligent people with big scientific institutions
Because all of the covicted smart people sent to Siberia during the last century
Also very cold weather in winter and hot in summer
Petersburg is known for all the intelligent and cultural but melancholic people
Even thugs there are very cultural and will say thank you after they mug you
Moscow is the reason in these cities problems, because they suck out the blood from these cities and people live is a hipster and gay or a bimbo
> Therefore it feels a bit like an overdimensional village
Truer words have never been spoken about Munich
> St
Petersburg - 5 mln
The capital of Russian Empire
Founded by Peter The Great in 1703 on lands conquered from the Swedes 18 years before the peace treaty that ended the war
Today St
Petersburg is considered as the culture capital of Russia, and the second city of Russia in all other aspects
Residents consider themselves as clever people of high culture, which is true to some degree
They also managed to get a new memetic title a few years back: the city of dismemberment
A few well-publicized crimes happened there a few years back, including a professor of history (it's the cultural capital, after all
) being caught with arms of his student lover in his backpack, so now every time something gruesome happens there people just shrug, because of course it's happened in St
Petersburg
I believe we, people of neighbouring countries, should visit each other as much as possible
Tourism is really eye-opening, while governments come and go (sometimes not very fast)
> Was that some subtle shade
Yes
A Muscovite arrives in St
Petersburg, goes to the house he's rented an apartment in, calls the elevator, the elevator arrives, the doors open and there's a man there squatting and taking a dump
The Muscovite is stunned with his mouth open, so the local replies (*use your best St
Petersburger snob impression*), "I don't know where you're from, but *here* it is considered polite to greet the other people in the elevator
I wouldn't say that typical inhabitant of Kupchino district in Spb is any different from a person from Chertanovo in Moscow
Yes, we do, often without rhyme or reason
Like, most rulers get a Russian version of their latinised name, but Iberian ones don't (Энрике, not Генрих)
Princes don't either
For instance queen Elizabeth becomes Elizaveta in Russian
French emperors called Louis are Ludovik's in Russian
You translate all Russian names, don't you
Like we translate all Ukrainian ones
Moscow and Saint Peters are the beauties cities I’ve seen
Russian lad speaking about Russia impartially
Kek
THAT is truly anecdotal
What places in northern Spain would you recommend to visit
Can relate to that
Those who like to point their accusing finger on people like you just don't understand how painful it is to highlight all the negative stuff just because truth has to be said
I tend to agree with all being said, however the situation is highly uneven
Some people are ok, some don't give a damn, some would be passive-agressive, some openly abusive
I could never say which category is the majority
Probably the passive-agressive one
I try to imagine a hypothetical situations with a gay man trying to hookup with some random guy at a bar
In approximately 20% of cases I see the gay one being punched in the face
I'd give 60% for polite rejection, 10% for not so polite rejection and 10% for glimpse of interest in the eyes of the random guy
But that's my assumption only
And one should bare in mind that I'm speaking about big cities, like Moscow, SP or Krasnodar
Not when you adopt a kid, as the recent story shows
The story is absolute nuts, I really hope it will somehow end good for them :( Though at the same time, guys lived semi-openly with fostered children for something like 8-9 years and only now got in wrong place in wrong time
Neighbours were ok with them, fostering agency was ok with them, colleagues were ok with them, one of children even told police before that he has two dads and nothing happened that time
But it took one asshole doctor and some officials wanting a promotion on a juicy theme to ruin it
Maybe this story will change something, if it'll be loud enough
In Russian it's initially a log, a round chunk of wood you make firewood from
It's still used in this meaning but not so often in the cities where you don't have a need in firewood
As a slur it started as "dumb" probably, we have lots of variations of "stupid like a wood" or "someone's head is made of wood, if you knock on it, it will make a typical wooden sound" in culture
Newcomers from Central Asia often didn't know the language and didn't understand things, so they were perceived as dumb
As a person who came back 3 weeks ago from a village in the middle of Siberian after visiting my extended family, I would say that you're not too wrong
It does look like 3rd world in some ways
But, for instance, almost every household from my native village has 2 cars (usually Japanese) with a house and a couple of acres of land and the nature around is absolutely pristine - like, we drove 2 kilometers away from the village and drank totally clear water from a lake surrounded by a premordial forest
It is a far cry from Africa or Bangladesh, where people don't have water and the air is so bad you can get a cancer by just looking at the picture of the capital
[Слот - Круги на воде]
Can’t say all their songs are awesome bot this is worth listening
Well, why was
He currently is
Ivan the Terrible
\- He founded 155 cities and fortresses, built 40 churches and 60 monasteries, created a state post office
general election of the local administration was introduced,
\- A large-scale reform of legal proceedings was carried out,
\- Many public schools founded
\- Typography began
\- Development of Siberia began,
\- The oprichnina king inflicted a severe blow to the princely-boyar oligarchy
\-Almost 2 times increased the territory of the country
&#x200B;
What a terrible, terrible ruler
He was not the best, but in the shortest possible time to put the backward agrarian country on the rails of industrialization, win the great patriotic war, and then again raise the country from ruins is not so easy
Well all you said about Stalin may apply for Putin
He just use more progressive ways to "control" opposition than just murdering it
About Yeltsin
to me he was nothing but the last real politician in Russia
He was already a politician in the USSR
And his beginning of rule was quite alright
But then FSB and oligarchs started conquering the country and pushed him too much
I think that's his problem
I believe he wasn't insane
He did too much good to be considered insane
From my point of view his insanity was nothing comparing to other absolute monarchs
Yeah, but he rewrites constitution anytime he wants
He rules the country for 19 years
4 times "elected" president while constitution allowed just 2
He even increased presidential term
He killed any possible opposition and strong politicians to be surrounded by a bunch of friends, relatives and oligarchs
He's so afraid of any competition that he simply denies people right to be elected
Just because
99% of the defendants are found guilty because cops don't even start investigating "dead" cases
1% - corrupted state workers and oligarchs
Talking about being the strongest
Average salary is somewhere around 200 euros
Old and disabled people mostly get around 70-100 euros
Teacher's and doctor's salaries are also around 100 euros
Strong enough
Strongest by which metric
I don't think any country sees Russia as anything but monkey with nukes or a gas station
All of that doesn't make him less insane
Also Siberia was inhabited before him, you know
He kinda fought it's residents to take their homeland
I always laugh when people say that Ivan "developed" Siberia and "doubled the size" of Russia
He slaughtered and raped native Siberians into submission
And to this day "developed" Siberia is about 20% inhabited at best
> - The oprichnina king inflicted a severe blow to the princely-boyar oligarchy
Yay for absolutism that would haunt Russia for centuries
> -Almost 2 times increased the territory of the country
Slaughtered, raped, and killed (just because other countries did it doesn't mean it's a cause to celebrate) Not to mention the disastrous and costly Livonian War
Now I do like the guy all things considered (a lot better than future monarchs) but he was literally insane
He killed his heir accidentally in a brawl (and was really remorseful and horrified afterwards)
Alltime crazyhead of Russia though was Peter the ~~Traitor~~ Great
Stalin was ruthless, not mad
So were both Americas, Australia, Africa, Britan and all other parts of the world
Expansion always causes it
Then let's write all the Roman generals and colonialists of America in the ranks of the madmen
I don't said it was good, but the same, as others conquerors
But the fact that since the 16th century most of Siberia has not been populated is no longer the fault of Ivan IV
I don’t know why in English it sounds "terrible", in russian it is closer to "redoubted". He was a tough guy, not the bad
...and in all of the rest republics
Some of these crimes were neccessary for progress of young countries, some were simple mistakes of inexperienced politicians
He also conquered half of territories of current Ukraine
Rebuild so much that to this day country with biggest reserves of natural resources can't produce anything but weapons, eastern regions basically sold off to China, rampant corruption, demographic crisis and dozen other problems that are not on the agenda, but for those US and Ukraine of course to blame
I prefer the version that it was just stupid resources management
There was bad crop year in most of regions in most of regions of the USSR
Additionally for some reason grain export was increased
The state tried to fix the situation by crops of the western-southern territories
If you check increase in mortality during starvation in 1932-1933 then you that the biggest one was in Kazakhstan, then Ukraine and Russia
Even in Moscow and Leningrad people felt lack of grain
But Ukrainian propaganda loves to use golodomor as an act of genocide by evil Russians
In modern times, I would say it was corruption trial for Minister of economics development Ulyukayev in 2016, ended 2018 with final sentencing him to 8 years serving in corrective colony (sort of a prison)
There were a handful of those, a whole series of trials for a number of governors about  corruption, but Ulyukaev's case was very much hyped in media, due to his high rank
What do Germans think about the "consensual cannibalism" case of Armin Meiwes
Do they agree with the outcome
No, I'm pretty sure that you can't change "Spasibo" in any way, but you can add a (pro)noun in dative after it if you want to specify who or what are you thanking: "Spasibo tebe" - Thanks to you, "Spasibo im" - Thanks to them, "Spasibo Mashe" - Thanks to Masha, etc
Russian
Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol - proze
Pushkin, Lermontov, Nekrasov - poetry
More than those, but the above is sort of a must
Wow, Divine Comedy is great, but it seemed to me as not for, say, not yet adult brains
And don’t forget 20th century poetry and prose: Bulgakov, Block, Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mayakovsky and so on
We also study foreign literature starting from Ancient Greece and move on to Shakespeare, Hugo, Byron, Moliere etc
and even some fun stuff like modern SF, Bradbury as an example
[someone made a list on Goodreads ] but it lacks a lot of books we had to read
Interesting, I've read about 60 of those 100 (some are repeated in the lust though)
Of course, those very detailed stuff is attrative
frankly speaking, I read this in 9th or 10th (last) year while in school so yes, I have to dismiss my previos statement
And yes, I have then lost an interest after purgatory, returned to heaven being an adult
A fuckton
Бутерброд or Butterbrot
A favored snack here,
Though not really a word more a food I suppose
Gastarbeiter,zugzwang,used to add -burg ending to russian cities
Ukrainians use even more of them
Things like a roof, an onion, paint are all Germanisms there
Similar in Russian, but we use male version, богомол (bogomol)
Как же вы заебали со своими советскими шуточками, хоспаде
Probably Kalinka or Katyusha
Also Tetris theme song - Korobeiniki
Stereotypes/ Thinking that everybody supports Putin/ Calling us commies/comrades
I don't find it funny
With kangaroos
Yeah, I mean, I support you guys :)
Get it back
No, he's from the Netherlands (cos you don't know from which region exactly), but he is Dutch (not Danish)
So, do they
That's exactly what i said, we dont know the region
Some were shot, some were sent to labor camps for many years
Some were lynched
Depended on the severity of how much you collaborated
and how Stalin was feeling on that particular day
A lot of the people we punished for being collaborators were just soldiers who were captured after being encircled or something
As far as the Communist Party was concerned; if you were captured you obviously didn't care enough about your homeland to go down fighting, taking at least one German with you
But yeah, if it was surrendering -- you went to the camps (if you survived the open air camps the Germans put you in originally to starve to death)
If you fought for them, you were shot
Not very kindly, although a few SS members did get away with it
Not for that many years
Former collaborators, especially Western Ukrainians, started most of the post-war prison riots
This made labour camps economically infeasible, as the authorities needed too many standing troops in godforsaken frozen shitholes
Those still incarcerated were amnestied in 1955, just 10 years after the end of the war
I'm just looking at all these answers thinking that I need to move abroad
I get basically nothing extra from my job (it is a start-up so I guess it's to be expected)
Lucky b*stards
I'm a researcher in an institution under the Russian Academy of Sciences
I've ever used only one benefit so far:
* Access to additional health care for me and the members of my family in the building right next to mine, without any queues
There are some other benefits:
* Free apartments or significant discounts on apartments for young employees who don't own property in the city yet
* Kindergarten in the same building as my workplace
* A small gym in the building
There are also yoga sessions with an instructor, I believe
* Discounts on trips to the local recreation center owned by my institution
* Occasional free tickets to excursions, concerts and so on
Freedom to choose my work schedule or even not appear at work if I don't feel like it is an additional unofficial benefit
Not technically a benefit of my employer in particular, but as a person with the PhD degree, I'm subject to 50% more vacation days than ordinary people, which results in 42 vacation days per year in total
Not that I use them anyway, though
9 extra days off, lunch allowance, health insurance
Phone, lunches and dinners, office gym, free taxi if you stay at work past 10pm, occasional free tickets to theaters, and of course private health insurance
There're plenty of both Russian and foreign companies offering comparable benefits in Russia
No need to move abroad
У меня брат работает в компании связанной с облачными технологиями или типа того (не шарю) и у него тонна таких же плюшек на работе. Так шо это просто зависит от профессии
We have ten vowel letters: а е ё и о у ы э ю я, I can't think of a word that contains all of them
Anyone who knows at least a bit about linguistics knows that it doesn't prescribe "correct" word usage
Venezuelan one is one of the easiest imo
It's the other way around from me, Spain Spanish is very difficult especially from Andaluthia and southern Spain
Whereas most Latin accents are very easy
In Peru and Chile weon is an actual thing, might be derived from huevon, but it took on a completely diferrent meaning
Means something like "bro" or "dude"
May 9, 1945 aka the Victory Day
It's a state religion at this point and perhaps the sole foundation of the nation
Холодец/Holodec (Aspic)
It’s a popular dish in Russia often served on celebrations
I like sweet jellies or gelatin desserts, but fuck Aspic
Borscht
I just hate vegetables except for carrots and cabbage
Porridge
I can eat buckwheat porridge and maybe rice porridge with coconut milk and a lot of fruit, but everything else is vile: oatmeal, pearl barley, semolina, millet
Crab salad, which is rice, chopped boiled eggs, FAKE crab, canned corn and mayo
It's a fucking staple these days and I hate it
Окрошка (okroshka) and холодец (kholodets)
I'm pretty much sure that almost every single Russian hates these foods, but for some apparent reason they are still pretty popular, and they're cooked for special events, like New Year or Birthday
>traditional Swedish casserole made of potatoes, onions, pickled sprats, bread crumbs and cream
I've never had this but it sounds delicious
Russians start nodding from moving head up and then down
I dunno how how long ago we started doing it, but we did it in USSR times to

It's a continental thing
I think only the Brits aren't afraid of it

The State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg is the best in Russia and one of the best in the world
If you're going to visit, don't miss the General Staff building (right in front of the Winter Palace), it's a part of the museum and it's beautiful
Peterhoff and the Catherine Palace are spectacular and worth a visit
In Moscow the best museums are: Moscow Kremlin Museums (Kremlin Armoury and Diamond Fund in the first place), State Historical Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics, State Darwin Museum and Paleontological Museum
Very prevalent - we have 790 KFCs (and only 693 McDonaldses)
I prefer KFC as well, and most people see it as a best of three big fastfood chains
There are loads of them, just like McDonalds and BK
Really popular and there are many restaurants here
Fun fact: there are (or were, not sure) at least 2 restaurants in Grozniy (Chechnya) called CFC (Chechen Fried Chicken) which is pretty much just a regular KFC, because international franchises don't want/can't to operate in Chechnya and Crimea
It also has a fascinating history: the local franchise was planned to be opened in the early nineties, but as soon as they received the know-how about operating fried chicken fast food joints, they severed all ties with Yum
and launched under their own brand, Rostik's.
In 2010 the owner of Rostik's actually sold the franchise to Yum
, effectively milking them twice
All post Soviet countries
Turkey, especially due to how many times we clashed during history
Whether they like it or not they have to be conscious of the overwhelming role we play in their lands
Poland becoming stronger
You're not post Soviet, you just have victim complex + self aggrandizement
Whatever makes you feel great man
You can have something against Russia and you'd have good reason for it
But this was about actual post Soviet countries and you just butted in lol, that's clear victim complex and self aggrandizement
But he wasn't talking about you to begin with
Chill, you aren't considered a neighbour
"The worst part about being poor in Switzerland, however, has to do with human psychology
In a country where you are surrounded by well-off people, barely scraping by REALLY sucks
You're right, this is an excellent point
Being poor in a poor country just makes you average
But being poor, surrounded entirely by wealthy people, means that you're an outcast
Yes same thing with my family in Russia
We had much less than in the US, but it didn't feel like it because everyone had the same amount
In the US you can make a lot of money, but if you live in a place like Washington DC or NYC or San Francisco, you can never truly be comfortable financially due to the insane cost of things
How much does life in the capital of your country differ from live outside of it
I have never been in any European country, but this is my dream
I will be able to meet you and show you a lot of wonderful places in region I live
Also, I can suggest you nice hotel to stay in my town
I’m a manager of that hotel
Probably Chechnya
It's a conflict temporarily halted by giving a lot of money to the ruling criminal gang in exchange for their loyalty
I'm not sure how long this status quo can last, but it seems fundamentally unstable
It's difficult to measure separatist movements in Russia, as separatism is criminalized and may result in real prison terms for participants, so people are very unlikely to express their feelings even if they have some
So who knows what might surface if/when the current Russian power vertical collapses
The best we have is making educated guesses
Most republic are generally too small and integrated into Russia to have significant separatism movements
Bashkortostan and Tatarstan are deep in the Russian territory and would always be heavily dependent on Russia, so separatism is economically unsound
They also have many Russians living there
Any separation is guaranteed to become a shitshow, so I don't think it will happen
Karels perhaps could have reasons to want merging with Finland instead of Russia (more similar language and culture, territories which have been part of Finland not so long ago), but Karelia is 80% Russians
Kaliningrad as an exclave has the most economic prerequisites for separatism, but it's overwhelmingly Russian, so it lacks some national self-identification for that
Another extremely difficult region is Crimea
As it is considered occupied by Russia in Ukraine, not recognized internationally, and heavily sanctioned, it's the region with the most political prerequisites for separatism
However, it's also majorly Russian, and I can't see it wanting to separate
I personally think it'll be in a contested state and a major pain in the ass both for Russia and for Ukraine for decades to come, but Russia and Ukraine will eventually make some deal in the future which will make Crimea officially Russian in exchange for something
I think for the real chance of separatism of a small part of Russia, it needs to have a combination of factors: to be at the Russian border, to have the majority not identifying as ethnic Russians, and to be poorly integrated into Russian institutions
I believe the only fitting regions are Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and Tuva
These are the only regions I could see separating during my lifespan
Chechnya is the most likely one, as it is already a de facto separate state with its own ruling hierarchy, uncontrollable army, and unofficial "laws" which contradict the Russian legislation
The [Kuril Islands situation] is not about separatism, but I'm fairly positive it will be solved during my lifespan, and Russia will cede some part of them to Japan in a mutual treaty
There is some chance for large-scale separatism in the future (like some people proposing the Ural Republic or the Far East Republic)
But I think it's more likely to result in some federalization and greater autonomy rather than complete independence, as these regions are economically and culturally linked to the European Russia and are way to sparsely populated to be completely independent nations
Some places have that problem (stray dogs), to the degree of real danger to kids and eldery
Blue is definitely the most common
In secondary education, some teachers take it quite seriously and won't allow any other colours to be used in class or assignments
Same here, haha
But some of our teachers didn't even let us use black pens, which doesn't make sense imo
The 'standard' is blue
It can be violet-ish as long as it's blue enough
When I was a kid, only the hosting parents would stay with us or sometimes we'd be completely on our own
I'd be embarrassed if my parents were present too, haha
Bit of both
It really depends on how well the parents know each other
When I was a toddler I was considered a friend of the children that were in the same ward as my mom, so the moms spent every birthday party together
My wife's mother was a good friend with her school friends' mother, so they always had an adult party of their own
When I had birthday parties of my own, the kids came alone
> I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
Yeah, it's super common here
I'd normally celebrate my birthday separately with friends, with my mum, with my dad, with my maternal grandparents, with my paternal side of the family, and with my uncle
So there was always a week worth of celebrations lol
Hope I haven't forgotten anyone
I am a simple man, I like a breakfast club sandwich (with an egg)

Plus I can't tolerate the language the Swiss dare to call German
Local trains are 2-3₽/km (0
022-0
033€/km), guess it's quite cheap by European standards
Long distance trains have varying prices, but usually in the same range
For example, 650 km from St
Petersburg to Moscow is 20-40€ in 2nd class sleeper and 30-50€ in high speed train
Downside is that the number of trains is limited compared to Western Europe, because of low population density and the idea that trains must be close to 100% booked to keep the prices low enough
In Russia it depends
Metro train in moscow costs 42 rubles (0
5 euro) and you can spend there whole day exploring >500 km of subway and surface lines if you like
Suburban rail cost depends on the distance and the type of a train, the most expensive ticket for over 100 km will cost you about 5 euro
Prices for inter-city rails vary greatly
High speed train from Moscow to Saint Petersburg (3,5 hours) would cost you 30 euro for economy seat
The most inexpensive train with a sit is about 10 euro, night train with a sleeping place is about 20 euro
The most expensive ticket from Moscow to Spb costs 400 euro, for this money you'll get a double bed with massage and remote control, shower and toilet in the compartment, TV, individual air conditioning, closet, safe, WiFi, dinner and breakfast, transfer by business class car
If you're really into long distance journeys, you can take a train to Vladivostok
6 days trip for as much as 80 euro is a steal
In Russia 40€ per 1000 km should be a pretty fair deal , if you have the ability to put up with three more neighbors in a train compartment , and 115€ if you wanna have just one more interlocutor in the room except your own self
But sometimes you can have a flight on the same distance for almost the same amount of money as a railroad trip
Some conditions could be pretty harsh though like you can’t have any luggage other then your carry-on stuff .
Constitutional court is in Saint Petersburg
War and Peace ofc
Tho the thing is I haven't read a single book from my program so
idc
"What is to be done
" by Chernyshevsky
I have read almost everything that was required in school but this one I somehow escaped
I remember that I tried but just couldn't get interested, it was kinda social philosophy in a poor disguise of novel and not very well written too, all this socialism, communes and dreams of Vera Pavlovna
So goddamn boring
I even always mix up Chernyshevsky with Herzen
Also, tried to read "Oblomov" by Goncharov not one but few times and every time I loved the beginning and got inevitably stuck somewhere in the middle
I should probably return and try one more time eventually
You can practically learn french by reading War and Peace
After dissolution of Soviet Union, the communist friendly word "tovaristch" ("comrade") is kinda replaced by an old "gospodin" or "gospoja", which are equal to "sir" and "madam" accordingly by meaning, but literally can be translated as "master"/"mistress" (absolutely communist unfriendly, hence the word being out of modern language for a few decades)
Certainly not lost, today "tovaristch" is akin to a "mate", often implying that a person shares an involvement in same activity or job
You might not be exactly friends with them, but if you share a field of work or a project, together you're likely to be  called "tovaristch".
About a month ago I've read a post on r/tifu where a guy forgot the word "celery" in a restaurant and had to describe his order as "green crunchy sticks" while looking and feeling pretty dumb (in his words)
I had a good laugh about it, only to realise that I forgot what is the word for "celery" in Russian and tried my hardest to remember it for the rest of the day without looking it up in a dictionary
By the time I finally recalled it I felt like both incredibly smart and stupid at once
Now I'm studying third language, should go down well :D
Yes, knew the word in English but couldn't remember how to translate it back into russian
I've actually come to appreciate Finnish quite a bit
I like listening to Finnish music even if I don't understand a word of it
Icelandic, because Vikings n' shit
Everything to do with stressing
Especially with the loanwords
The word "millennial" for some reason has the stress on the last syllable in Russian, which sounds awful if you're used to reading it in English
Also academically correct stressing is usually not the same as colloquially accepted, thus there are a lot of opportunities for snobs to correct you
Edit: oh and we do have a word "millennium" which has a stress on the correct syllable
Stresses like to dance all around the words here
I guess it's connected more with courtesy than with language, but it still annoys me
Pronoun "ti" used when you addressing to one person, and pronoun "vi" when you addressing to two or more people
But you need to say "vi" when you addresing to ONE person but with big authority
I think the same thing in Ukrainian and Belarusian, but I'm not sure
We have the same problem in Russian, although people usually put it when it matters (все - everyone vs всё - everything)
Real problems are with names: there are names (like Артём) and surnames which have ë in them, but when filling in the birth certificate parents may or may not put it in, which may lead to errors in documents
I don't know about French, but I think that in Russian people started use polite form when it came from French
Aristocracy used to speak French a lot
And yes, formal "vi" is often used
• Ukraine: That’s the plan, har har har
• Belarus: Nothing changes
• Kazakhstan: Nothing changes
• Poland: *Lzhedmitriy flashbacks*
• Estonia and other Baltic countries: Solves the problem with Russian minorities therein
Creates innumerably more problems
• Finland and Norway: PLEASE
• Mongolia: *Golden Horde intensifies*
• China: An unstoppable industrial empire with complete disregard for individuals
Goodbye Internyet
• Japan: Solves the Kurils dispute
We also get quality sushi
• USA: The more rabid conservatives in both countries either destroy each other or find someone else to hate
EDIT:
• North Korea: That’s a nice planet you’ve got there
Would be a shame if someone nuked the hell out of it
I thinkn our government is already trying to merge is with Ukraine
So as you see it's not a happy marriage at all
Also most of our neighbors were previously part of: Finland, all former USSR republics
China, Norway, North Korea and Mongola are the only our neighbors who weren't part of Russia
12 out of 16 neighbors were part of an empire
Most of them won't be happy to get on the old track
> edit- what do countries with multiple borders do
That's the question here
*heavy breathing in Russian*
>Belarus – Grand Republic of Lithuania 2
We will throw out Russian language
Good luck, lol, given that more than a half of the potential united state now speaks Russian as primary everyday language
I've done it (several times actually, as part of my then job), and let me tell you, even with work to be done over the course of the journey, it's fairly boring
Nothing really happens and the scenery isn't even *that* good - there is a lot of industry next to the railroad
Georgia - nothing changes, but South Ossetia and Abhazia join the new country
Azerbaijan - did you know there's an Azeri minority in Iran that needs protection
Turkey - Erdoğan and Putin must oil wrestle for presidency
Our combined navy upsets the balance of power in the Med
Iran gets really nervous as well
Russian men protest the merger, fearing they won't gets any pussy now
Democratic lustrations of unloyal population up to democratic ethnic cleansing and contained and strictly controlled democratic genocide is the way to go
*\*Changeover Day intensifies\**
Do many Finns know Swedish
I thought that nowadays almost nobody speaks it there
I have a similar one, as a kid I thought Russia and Germany had a border because WW2 propaganda is *so* omnipresent even in modern Russia (even in the relatively liberal period I grew up in)
Impressive for 8 years old to realise it on their own
Usually not
Maybe when the gathering is big enough that you have to rent a banquet room
If the family gathering is small enough to fit into an apartment then there's probably not enough kids and more importantly, no spare tables
Yeah it's a bit odd
Seen as low-class
The numbers themselves aren't bad, but let's say you want to say how many "houses" there are:
* 1 дом = 1 house
* 2/3/4 до́ма = 2/3/4 **of** house
* 5-20 домов = 5-20 **of** house**s**
* дома́ = house**s**
Etc
So basically you have to use different grammatical case-number forms of the noun with different numbers
Our number structure is the same as the English one, at least something to make the life easier
Why is the switch on 16
Latin had prefix for 17 as well (septendecim), right
Normal Slavic languages:
* czterdzieści, čtyřicet, četrdeset, četirideset
Eastern Slavic languages:
* sorok/sorak
Yeah, I've also read something about that but don't remember shit, haha
Forgot to say that "1" is different for masculine, feminine & neuter ("один", "одна", "одно"), and "2" for masculine/neuter & feminine ("два", "две")
Other numbers don't change for gender
Yeah, same with человек/люди and 21
Russian has "only" 6 cases that are presented in grammar textbooks
But it also has:
1) the new vocative case for a fairly large group of nouns (mostly names but not only)
2) up to 3 distinct locative cases for some nouns;  the one for "where to" is different from the accusative, the one for "where at" is different from the prepositional, and the one for "where from" is different from the genitive
3) the partitive case for some nouns that is different from the genitive
4) the translative case is used with a number of verbs indicating a change of state (like in English: "to run for president", "to enroll into the actors")
5) separate forms for some units of measurement when used with a number
(the 4th and 5th coincide with some forms of the normal 6 cases but it wouldn't make sense to ignore them)
Reddit is nowhere near popular here, and English is spoken by less than 5% of the population

I'm not surprised

Out of the new stuff my son watches, I like *Orange Cow*. It doesn't have the production values of Masha, but unlike 99% of family sitcoms it doesn't feature a useless dad
Not the same language but Slavonic languages tend to have same word roots with different meanings
So every Russian in Czechia will notice signs "Pozor, policie varuje" and laugh his ass off
In Czech it means "Attention, the police notifies" apparently, but in Russian it means "What a shame, the police steals" :D And the word "pozor" in Russian has pretty dramatic negative meaning, to shame or to blame someone for something
Beards have been growing in popularity and really took off during the pandemic, since men stuck at home could grow through the awkward "too long for a stubble, too short for a beard" phase
Catherine sure liked her lovers
She had entire quality control conveyor belt for them, she only slept with people who were validated in bed by First Dame
She used her numerous ladies-in-waiting to test drive and rate prospective bedmates, with the final test being her closest confidante
English is increasingly spoken as a lingua franca among people who don't share the same native language, like in this international community
I haven't noticed English replacing Russian as a primary language in Russia, and I believe it's the same in other countries with their own languages
Zero reasons to worry
In Russia, it's definitely [Cossacks] that first come to mind
While they usually had a function of border guards, they are also responsible for Russian expansion to the east in Siberia and south in the Caucasus region and to a lesser degree in Central Asia
If we are speaking for my country I want to live in the USSR
Maybe 1980s. That’s the best Soviet years
Some people say that it used to be perfect time and the rest of them say that it wasn’t so good
I want see it by myself
But if I could pick some period not in my country I will pick USA 1930-1940s. That criminal time
To live in New York full of mafia families
I like that stuff
Honestly for most of the history Russia has been kind of a shit place to live

14 total, 3 of them are in Moscow

They are popular here
Not enough
In Russia and everywhere across CIS people call them N word or at least Blacks
That’s how we are taught since kindergarten
There are three big races: White, Yellow and Black
No hatred
That’s quite illogical thing
Why it’s okay to call white people white, and using “black” is offensive
Also even in Moscow africans aren’t so often met as in other European capitals
People often stare at them and even might point at them
Not because they hate them
It’s like seeing a Lamborghini or Bugatti
You just can’t see that everyday here
There can’t be any hatred in here
Firstly there’s just no reason to hate (I don’t think that even a million of africans visited Russia since 9th century till 1917) and secondly our greatest poet Aleksandr Pushkin had an african grandad
> Also even in Moscow africans aren’t so often met as in other European capitals
I see them every day handing out flyers or selling counterfeit perfume
Black people commuting to work or just enjoying life are a much rarer sight, of course
We call then almost the same way чёрный(chorniy), чернокожий(chernokozhiy)
Of course there are more offensive words черномазый(chernomaziy), чернозадый(chernozadiy), черножопый(chernozhopiy) etc
Also negr is more common than nigger here in Russia
Not in Russia
If you go and complain because of being called black you will be asked “Then who are you
White or yellow
Yeah also can be often seen in South-West of Moscow near RUDN
But I don’t see them often near my home
Positive discrimination is a negative thing for me
They say “everybody’s equal”, than have a plan of how many blacks they must hire
Not whites, not yellows
Blacks
Discrimination can’t be positive
We’re less racists as you are

The periodic table symbols are in Latin script, and Russian uses Cyrillic, so that's already a difference
Many elements which correspond to substances known for a long time have native Russian names which are different, like *vodorod* (H), *uglerod* (C), *kislorod* (O), *azot* (N), *zhelezo* (Fe), *kremnij* (Si), *zoloto* (Au), *serebro* (Ag), *olovo* (Sn), etc
Other elements (especially newer ones) have names similar to their symbols because they are more recent loanwords, like *gelij* (He), *litij* (Li), *kaltsyj* (Ca), *palladij* (Pa), *alyuminij* (Al), *uran* (U), and so on
For real
Pb is *svinets*, Sn is *olovo* in Russian
Seems like we've encountered one of many Slavic false friends
My favorite Czech one is "pozor" (attention) which means "shame" in Russian
It's fun to walk around Prague and see "Shame

Officially it’s called ampersand in Russian, but I’ve never heard it outside of professional field
People usually call it ‘and sign’ («знак энд» or «знак и»)
But it’s used very rarely, usually in some (quasi-)Western logos
It’s not in the language tradition and there is no point to replace a one-symbol conjunction (и) with a different symbol

Because Muscovy princes were the sneakiest of all russian cities
Originally the Moscow became a capital just by conquering (or buying/inheriting) the other principalities of a fractured Late Middle-Ages Russia
Then Peter I moved capital into a newly built St
Petersburg in 1712, but the Bolsheviks moved it back into Moscow in 1918 because at that time the Germans were still advancing on the Eastern Front of WWI, so the Bolsheviks were afraid to remain Petersburg (at that time Petrograd) as the capital since it was closer to the front line, hence more vulnerable than Moscow
No, it was renamed in 1914
Saint Petersburg sounded too German (in Russian it sounds like Sankt Peterburg, which is even more German), so they renamed it to sound more Russian (-grad means "city" in Russian, so basically Petrograd is the same as Petersburg, but Russified)
I guess, it is comparable to the British royal family changing their surname to Windsor for the same reason
Actually, the interim government (or Provisional government, as it is more traditionally called by historians) also planned to move the capital into Moscow because of the frontline
They just didn't manage to be long enough in charge of the country to do that
Graded by the level of obscenity:
"все равно" — "all is equal"
"без разницы" — "no difference"
"мне фиолетово" — "to me it's purple" (sounds pretentious and a bit outdated)
"пофиг" — "by the fig" (?) I don't know how to translate it literally
"похер" — "by the dick" (this is a "bad" word but not so bad
"похуй" — "by the dick" (this is a "bad" word)
"пох" — a shortened version of the above
There should be "мне" ("to me") before the last four imo
Also there's "меня не ебёт" - \[it\] doesn't fuck me
I had no idea it was used elsewhere
Yeah it can be there, but it doesn't have to imo
I don't think I've ever heard it, but it's possible
I've definitely heard "что то говно, что это говно" (means the same thing)
Or "что то хуйня, что это хуйня". Or perhaps some other variation

What are some examples of overly-formal or strange phrases that foreigners learning your language seem to always get taught
I've only experience with German and Russian, myself, but it seems to me that English speakers learning both languages get saddled with some overly formal phrases that just aren't used
In Germany's case, this could be a High German thing (I don't know, I only learned it at school) whereas, in Russian, I assume it's just some attitude that teaching people the most formal/complicated way to say something means they'll have an easier time of things in general (they'll understand people in general while still being able to comprehend overly formal nonsense)
But I mean, to give some examples with Russian, here's one daft phrase I was taught back at a Russian school:
Извините пожалуйста, вы не знаете где находиться библиотека?
"Excuse me, please, but you don't know where the library is located, do you
It's perfectly fine but I've never heard a Russian speak like this
Some people have even laughed a little because it's sort of like "British logic" (about manners) applied to a foreign language
Why say "Excuse me, but you wouldn't happen to know where the library is located, would you
" when you can just say "Excuse me please, where is the library
As for English; a lot of Russian kids learn to say stuff like "I seldom go fishing
" Who the hell says "seldom" in regular conversation
Or, when they want to say someone is frugal, they're taught to say "he's a very mean person
" I don't think any English people would take that to mean a person who doesn't like spending money
So, yeah, would be interested to hear what it's like with other languages - German, French, Spanish, Italian
do you have a lot of foreigners using overly formal/dated phrases because their education systems teach some kind of high academic language dating from the 1950s?
Haha
I actually found it really cool that other languages have formal/informal pronouns; I assumed it meant you could easily show where people stand with you and that, when you meet someone new and get to know them, you have some cool "level up" moment when they switch pronouns with you <3
Then I moved to Russia and found that everyone under 40 almost exclusively uses informal means of address outside the most formal of situations
It actually bothers me a little because I'm not too keen on unearned familiarity (back in the UK, I didn't like when people called me "mate," "pal" or "friend;" I'm not your friend
I don't know your name
Stop schmoozing me
Hah, I think Hueber textbooks say that you should address your waiter either as Herr Ober (man) or Fräulein (woman)
I tried a Michel Thomas French course and I believe this was the first full phrase he taught, lol
That phrase is so dead that, when I was in North Korea, our tour guide there tried to use it to demonstrate familiarity with slang
That's because, oddly enough, Oxbridge English books are written by middle aged coddled Oxbridge academics
Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod :)
I've never heard anyone negate the знаете. Perhaps my wife and the company she keeps are just filthy but they'd just say "Вы знаете где...?" Doesn't вы *не* знаете come off as somewhat pretentious
>я изучаю русский язык instead я учу русский.
Fuuuuuuuck
>как ты?
At least this one I get right, lol
For sure is fine, isn't it
Guess it depends on the context
"So are we on for this evening
" "Yeah man, for sure
"He must've known it was you for sure
And then let's not forget glorious Ebonics and "fo' sho'."
Maybe it's a Yankee thing
I'm going to listen out to other Brits, now
I worry that being out the country might have thrown off my perception of BrEnglish
I'm the worst person to ask for Russian advice, but I'd just ask "Вы знаете где библиотека (похалуйста)
To be fair, though, pretty much every English textbook teaches "I have got
I think the logic is that teaching them a sentence that is too complex is preferable to their only learning the simple version and therefore not understanding the more complex one should they happen upon it
I don't deny that "mean" once meant someone who was tight-fisted
E.g. "you mean old miser
But I'd wager that you ask any young'un on the street what comes to mind when the word "mean" is used and they'll say it means unpleasant or not notice
No, negated questions are the polite form in Russian, but my wife embarrassed me in a shop in Winchester once by asking the shopkeeper "Don't you have this in a smaller jar
" I had to teach her that this doesn't sound polite at all
I ain't your mate, pal
It sounds like Agent Provocateur branching out into contraception market

By the way, you're the fellow who ran that blog that wanted to talk to me like a year ago, right
:p Sorry, I never got in touch
I would add **а** to make it **извините, а где библиотека?**, but a negated question is always appropriate
Fuck, you can probably just leave it at "где библиотека?"
There was a Russian poster in this thread saying that people do use the formal variant to be polite
but in my experience (in Siberia at least), people are short and to the point with their requests
Wow, interesting
I mean, I'm 28, and never encountered that meaning until I heard Russians using it, which made me do some digging myself
I've been teaching English here for five years
Just turn up to a city that isn't Moscow or SPB and schools will throw jobs at you
Ша for Russian: Саша, Паша, Наташа, Миша, Лёша...
Sasha, Pasha etc
Same in Russian, but there are some curious things like Aleksey – Liosha (Алексей – Лёша), so it even doesn't have many common letters, or Georgiy - Gosha (Георгий – Гоша)
And as far as I know, in Ukrainian Oleksandr also is Sasha
Perhaps, this "sha" stuff sounds soft and cozy
Maria is also Masha,  and I think it's a real tendency

The problem is if the city is built with cars in mnd already it's a hassle to get anywhere even if you had busses going non-stop through the same roads
European cities might be better in that regard, but try to use public transportation to get to a cinema or to work from some american suburb, especially if you want to do it on repeat
You need good centralization of population for the public transport to be effective, even if we ignore that public transportation can be depressing if it's struggling with volume of people
It's not hard to build without abundance of cars in mind
A lot of distrcitcs in the middle of Moscow are still unable to accomodate cars even when population density is very high
It's just many high rise apartment builngs close together with most of the destinations (groceries, cinemas, schools, clinics - there are dozens of them within very small areas because of that) in pedestrian accessibility, but all of the streets are littlered in cars parked on top of each other
Soviets just didn't expect 500 people in the building to own 250 cars
I could reasonably say that Moscow would probably be ok with only public transport
It just that it takes arguably the best metro system in the world and spam of buses, vans, trams, trolleys etc
I don't think you can repeat it in every city
And it's probably impossible in cities where you don't have all your daily destinations (save for work) in pedestrian access
I’m so jealous

Invest who
This statement of this supposed researcher is ridiculous, Ronaldo and Messi funded by their sponsors and wealthy club owners plus fans that go to stadium for the sake of entertainment and her salary paid from the taxes/government investment including this supposed researcher
The people who seek cure is a general public, which can't give Ronaldo or Messi millions
There no one to blame and whole statement is like a forged click bait filled with ignorance
And how you want to invest and where you want to invest and on which funds you want to invest
You can't have economy that generate money without investing into economy back and you can't have funding for this researches without taking excesses of the economy that you invested into and this excesses will go not only into this researches, but for other programs and then you getting into politics where people start arguing what more important a cure from flu or new schools or homeless program or counter boogeymen from afar and where to cut funds and then among programs which one you prioritize and when you slash the one that stuck instead of making it money sinkhole
"We need more money" was never the answer to fixing any problem nor poverty, nor health, nor education
>No investment in anything has ever worked
That sounds pretty communist to me
Communist approach toward science is exactly what kind of science investment of the government should exists in minds of some people
Like pour all the resources into state running universities and research labs and find the cures
Then you have completely unsustainable research budget and spread of the fields with dead researches that became money sinks

New Year without snow is just sad
Makes me feel very homesick for Siberia
We had like a week of proper snow last year in November
Then it all melted away and never came back
This December is also going to be rainy if the forecast is correct
When I was in Riga last year, the only thing that was missing was snow
The city looked gorgeous with its Christmas decorations, and snow would have made it even more perfect
Overall I hate snow, but on Christmas it’s a must

So based on this, Lenin was either tatar or Uzbek
the Tatar, an infamous supervillain, and his henchmen
Seriously speaking, he's from my hometown of Ulyanovsk, then Simbirsk, which is very close to Tatarstan and has always been a melting pot of Russians, Tatars, Chuvash and Mordvin
As a matter of fact, one of the oldest street was called Tatarskaya as there was quite a few Tatars living
I showed this but without names to my grandpa who was born in USSR
He only messed up Latvian and Estonian
What does this have to do with the post
Well, Russia does have great potassium and Natasha is definitely the best prostitute in the city
That’s why the used those charts in the first place, their goal was not to be racist but to identify people
If their goal was not not to be racist, why didn't they include blacks and Asians
At least they're slow enough to catch right after
Because they weren’t part of the Soviet Union

The joke's on you, Russia is trivially easy to invade in winter
Try spring or autumn instead, good luck with the mud season
There is a reason why you never hear of anybody trying to invade in April
He he he
Surely you meant Ιερεμίας Κληρίδης?
I remember that the first joke in Russia about him was regarding the fact that with such last name someone going to play on him, guess Kaczynski is a great musician
I don't think Britons who voted leave care if other countries followed their lead
They care for their own country as they should
This seems like an attempt at cheap political points
Don't worry Turkey, at least you did vote
Guys, don't make my mistakes
Ride the tittle first, ALWAYS FIRST I SAD
Yuck, prob sum pedophile
So, I think it's safe to conclude that there's no source
Either this whole thread is on to some meme that I'm unaware of, or everybody just wants to believe in the femboy thing THAT much
We can only wonder why
How do we know that it's not a lady he's holding
I would love a source because she looks very female to me
I blame sexual frustration from years of being alone and spamming /pol/
Totally looks like a girl in cosplay to me as well
There's zero masculine traits that I can see based on this pic, in fact, everything about her body and face screams natal female to me
We can talk about democracy as much as we want but to be honest and objective, even if we have fair elections : he will never win, but Putin will, unfortunately
That’s why I don’t even understand why they are trying to pressure him
Probation violation I think
They probably are going to go to court and try to replace his probation with real sentence
Of course they have no real case for that, not like he left country by choice for some vacation
Still, from what I expect from Russian justice system, Navalny will probably lose the case, and it may go all the way to **ECHR** before they admit that it is bullshit
Which might take up to couple of years
He violated the terms of the suspended sentence he was under for embezzlement, and was arrested when he returned to the jurisdiction
> the Russia problem
Uhhh
Russian subreddit is full of kremlinbots
No sane russian would even subscribe to it
I guess that gas pipeline is just too lucrative
Elections are fully controlled by government
And we all no, that nobody will do that
Cash flow of stolen money from Russia is just too good
> like we saw in 1991-1992
Or like we see today in Ukraine I guess
Ukraine most definitely degraded over the past 30 years
Particularly fast since maidan
Yeah, Poroshenko and his thieving friends have become very rich, but the ordinary Ukrainian lives worse and worse by the day
Ah yes, polish ultra-conservatism
As a slav, I want us all dead

Where did you even heard this lul
Most of "nazis" I see want to stop importing culturally incompatible people
Either I'm stupid or you're bad at explaining things
US population supports slavery in general
I browse LITERAL NAZIS' imageboard and ~99% of them think slavery was among the biggest mistakes of humanity which led to cultural strife in the end
I can't relate to your experience, sorry
You consider 0,01%'s radical point of view as worthy to be used as a label for 50% of US population (or whatever the number of republican voters now)
People of reddit tend to assume A FUCKING LOT about those they differ in opinions with
So that's why he arrest Russians right before elections, right
That's a very intersting but unusual way to assimilate into Russia imo
Russians are tired of Luka too tbh
Just look at Russian part of Twitter
Our friends are beaten on the streets and thrown in jails in Minsk and around
Probably there's a lot of deals between him and Kremlin - but Belarus people should continue the pressure
edit: grammar
No one is playing innocent since i don't care about mercs
Could you just try to saw the point of my message - if Luka is going to sell Belarus to Russia he's doing it in a very weird way starting with a diplomatic row with Kremlin dwellers
Well it isn't the first time Germany will rule over France
Well congrats
It's not the outcome I had hoped for, but it's the one you guys chose
Lets hope it pays off
Worsened for me
I expected the health crisis because of the greedy healthcare system, but I did not expect the riots and the new wave of censorship

Russia and Ukraine having the same amount of journalists jailed combined as one small Azerbaijan has surprised me seeing our strict laws and war between countries
Russia: ok, 5 journalists, maybe
The problem is, journalism is already dead here, so it's more correct to count all of the political arrests
There were one metric fuckton of political arrests in Russia in 2019
TUUUUUURRRRKS
Excuse me but what exactly can you confirm
Have you, like, personally seen those 150+ detained journalists
Edit: there are a few people here who thought that I tried to doubt the fact that Turkey is messed up so I'll clarify: uhm, nope, what the fuck
I just wanted to address that a phrase "I confirm" just because you are from the same country doesn't make sence
It's like if I said "I am from Moscow and I confirm, Nemtsov was indeed misteriously assasinated in the center of the city
". That would just be nonsense
Lol
This image is indeed amusing
Me russian
Me confirm
Putin bad
Belarusians aren't afraid of expressing themselves to a random Ukrainian
You have a grotesque view of how things are in Belarus
Many in this topic have never been to Belarus, don't speak their language and might not even know any Belarusians
Their knowledge about life in Belarus is quite likely not much better than about life on Mars
A Ukrainian visiting Belarus would get more out of said visit than you might for example
Simply because he knows the language, he knows the culture and he can read the context and cultural cues that would be lost on an outsider
It's a crazy to drink with someone in Russia if you're hitchhiking
So much things can go wrong and will
Lol, they did, you just don't know
Lots of people are on here commenting "yikes, no masks, they should really have masks on, stay tuned for the pneumonia spike in two weeks"... You're not wrong
But it's important to remember that Russia already had a year long shit response to COVID so a lot of of these people already had it and now have some sort of immunity
More importantly, and this is not up for debate, there will come a time where the benefits of fighting for your rights will outweigh the illl effects of a widespread virus
I fear that Russia may be approaching that boundary sooner that the western world may want to admit
Navalny is a hero
He was able to unite people against Putin despite the complete information blockade in the russia media
With his courage he gave us hope that Russia would be free
A good chunk of protesters aren't exactly his supporters but just good people who are against state crimes
That's a hard to swallow pill ...
Thank you, it's important for us feel world's support
There are many people in Russia who like polish culture
I really, really, really wish you lived in Russia and tried to change things
People in this country dont get a word at all
Unlikely
Out of all people i know only two support him
Even my grandmother opened her eyes after imvestigations of Navalny, she used to be pro-putin as hell
Ah shit
That's sinister as hell
Okay, I see the central station and the famous St
Tourist cathedral
Where is Skripal's house
Yes, Constitutional Court, provoke **mass protests** during Covid pandemic
We have same jokes about 70 cases in Russia for 70 tests
Are you pneumonia cases or cold cases high
>I have this faint hope that if cases in Russia were actually rising fast and the government was trying to censor it, the information about such cases would still be available in the west because Russia is not isolated or nowhere near the censorship level that exists in China
They have no capacity to censor it like China does, there a plenty of russian talking media that aren't in Russia and there a lot of opposing media that can go with line of party till it matters to them
So they may not critic Putin, but hiding truth about Covid-19 can set them off on the hunt
>Doctors in Russia would rise awareness by releasing information through various available media devices, twitter, reddit, youtube etc
Well, they rather would rise awareness about lack of tests
>Even China had tough time hiding the rapid rise of cases despite the massive censorship
The panic and comments that Russia "is certainly hiding cases and they are in thousands already" are absolutely ridiculous and unfounded in my opinion
So far it seems to me that Russian government aren't trying to hide anything and were rapid in their actions against spreading of disease
It's true that everyone suspicious that cases so low, but i can understand why so
First of all probably a lot of clinics do not have proper tests for detecting Covid-19 and there is a problem with the fact that Covid-19 leads toward pneumonia, so if you getting hospitalized you probably will be diagnosed with pneumonia and all the actions will be focusing on beating bacterial pneumonia, which won't help in this case and in the post-mortem autopsy you body will show pneumonia case and no test will show any microflora after that heavy amount of antibiotics you will get in normal treatment, so i think the cases are mislabeled by lack of knowledge or lack of testing, not vile intent, but at the same time i don't think that we so bad case as Italy, due to our landmass and scarcity of the population
So far they following the suit of the WHO and i heard they have higher access to the Chinese research due to politics, so maybe they cook something up as a medicine, while US trying to buy it from Germany
Edit:
Also forgot to mention that media seems to be required now to decrease tension in their articles, for example they started using "gas clap" instead of "gas explosion" in articles and it seems like there were influx in the cold/pneumonia articles cases in the past months, so either they became cautious and reporting everything or they using this "soft" language
Hard to guess
New sanctions here we go

Still, fuck Trump

Time is a mystery
The "Russian military support" to Lukashenko that people in this thread are talking about is related only to CSTO and, as Alex forgot to mention, an external military threat
So in that sense, he's on his own
Russian government officials seem to be kind of quiet
I wonder if they're hoping for an Armenian solution, i.e. the dictator is out, but Belarus maintains a pro-Russian stance
It would make the most sense as well
Russian media, however, throws this upside down
I'm kinda confused at this point
RT, uuh TV stuff, bots in the state media comment sections - all talk about "Western methods", Nazis (because apparently Nazi collaborators used the white-red-white flag
Well might as well ban our tricolor, because the ROA used it), all the worst adjectives and names you could possibly think a Russian chauvinist would say
Also, there was a little pro-Lukashenko rally in Moscow, or so I saw on social media, with people holding signs basically calling for Belarusian OMON to murder everyone there
Zhirinovsky said something about how Russia shouldn't allow NATO tanks near Smolensk - but hopefully nobody actually cares about him these days
Fun times
Hope we will get the same in Russia soon

You have a very well defined group who thinks you deserve death for speaking against them
If this is not a culture or values issue then what
They will keep killing and you will keep cleaning up aftermath instead of preventing
Yep, I've read it
>economic factors
I have no statistics for Europe (show it to me of you have), but looking at USA stats, most wealthy sample of one cultural group can commit more crimes than most poor sample of the other
While economic factor is unarguably there, you didn't presented any argument against cultural part
>poorly integrated
What falls under "integration"? I'm afraid you yourself will end up with culture and values while trying to define it
Is speaking a language of country you're in is culture, for instance
Doesn't seems like an economic factor to me at least
Well, it took them only what, 50 years, to admit to the Katyn massacre
I hope it will happen sooner this time
Best case scenario, I guess, would be like Russia paying compensation for the relatives and giving the condolences for "terrible loss of life".
Highly doubt that anyone would be prosecuted, if they were really Russian service members
Also there are a lot of real bots on YouTube
Bots usually operating on the web-resources popular in Russia
But reddit is not one of them
So I doubt if there are any bots
But there can be real people who support Putin
I think as an independent journalist or an opposition politician you have a much higher chance of not getting any work and starving to death, rather than being murdered
Don't get me wrong - the oppression is real, but in most cases it's a lot more subtle than what you see in the comical portrayal by the media
The overwhelming amount of damage is done trough economic pressure and exhausting harassment, not the blunt force
How's that temple of NOD doing

60 thousand people is surely below the announced 100 thousand, but it's finally still something
Still not enough
> an enormous succes
By what measure
None of the demands have been met so far
To get to participate in Duma elections you have to gather a certain number of signatures from your supporters
A lot of independent candidates who did this for the upcoming Moscow election got denied their registration as a candidate because number of fake signatures and errors in filling in the forms for such signature gathering is above allowed threshold
That's the official position
But of course the signatures aren't actually fake and the errors are very minor/the rules aren't actually written anywhere about these kind of mistakes
The candidates go to court and lose without having their arguments considered at all
Another thing fueling this is how many people got detained and treated violently during the last protests that were not approved by the local government
People believe the law that requires such approvals goes against the constitution
See [my comment here]
I don't think there is any correlation between political system and imperialism
The US and the UK are pretty democratic, but still invade, meddle in other countries and what not
I can't see how that hypothetical democratic Russia would be any less imperialistic
~~Third actually
First was on July 27th, second on August 3rd and this is the third one~~
Ok, I forgot about several protests in July
Yeah, that's a degree of desperation
The mere fact of people going to the streets is seen as a tremendous success
> People believe the law that requires such approvals goes against the constitution
The problem is that it doesn’t. The constitution says “citizens of Russia can protest peacefully and unarmed” but it also admits that constitutional rights of people can be affected by the federal law
And the federal law prohibits “illegal” protests
Yeah
It’s not that the Kremlin doesn’t care about the Russian constitution
It’s that the constitution itself is fucked
I'm not going to debate this kind of uninspired demagoguery on my phone
You know the right answer to your loaded question yourself
A lot of people whose signatures were rejected were glad to  eyewitness in court and present video of them making the signature too, judges were not interested
Opposition candidates started taking extra evidence like these videos since a few years ago unwanted candidates were sabotaged by infiltrated agents who deliberately spoiled signatures
We had once
At least the West approved Yeltsin's era as such
Totally sucked and costed trillions of GDP and millions of lives
It’s not even being overridden, technically
The federal law is more of a clarification
Constitution: You can protest and shit
Also constitution: the federal law is legit
Federal law: yeah you can protest, you just need to get a permit for that so that we make sure that your protest doesn’t disturb anyone
She followed his finger with her eyes as if he was pointing at something, but there was nothing - it's just such a gesture - and then felt like stupid because there is nothing there at where she looked

I have always thought the Moscow Metro left it unfinished and brought it as a design idea
I'll be there in about an hour
I go that area frequently, but I've never been to the metro station
Looks rad
There's a really wild shopping mall next to it that has all kinds of electronic equipment and retro gaming shops
I'm going there to buy a PS2 (fat version), my old one is back in the States and I miss playing Socom
But yeah, I'll run down and check out the station today
I'm so sick of this picture
I prefer by far the classic style of the old subway stations this futuristic shit seems to have no soul
It's 409 km long already
And would increase a bit in a few days with 1 new station opening
Не баг, а фича!
Lmao, I hate that mall
It's always impossible to find the particular shop that you need
It's even more of a nightmare if your phone is broken and you're going there to get a new one that you have already pre-ordered
Hope you don't get lost
Is that near the skyscrapers
This particular station was built with the plan in mind that it would be a closing-doors style stations, meaning you wouldn't see the outside wall as it would be covered by the train
[It looks roughly like this
] But the plans changed mid-construction so it had to be built this way
> Russian train stations
Rather train stations in Moscow and St Petersburg, and not even all of those
Tbh, this is the first time i've seen this
Putin himself sits in a tiny room at the end of the station and watches everyone to get poisoned
Moscow metro is famous for its tidiness
I don't really know how they do it
Was the mayor planning on more American tourists coming to visit
I really wonder what you imagine there happening
Well, I don’t think that gay people look any different than heterosexual people so you’ll be fine as long as you don’t make out with a dude in public or have an LGBT flag with you
Yes, that’s pretty fucked but you’ll be fine as long as nobody knows you’re gay :/
And if you see a group of chechens or gopnic-esque looking Russians, you should stay away from them no matter if you’re gay or not
You're overestimating your importance to random strangers on the street, especially when it comes to Moscow
Well, I'd say that Russia is somewhat 5-7 years from saying "fuck it" and letting it go, of course, if a Pride event will get a permisson to happen
It' still too easy to stigmatize public gatherings without official permissions, especially for older generations
Shit's depressing, man

This is not true, Russia hates everyone
[me for the last few days] reading news and polls and seeing how situation in this country keeps getting worse
and looking at the comments, it feels like our reputation has been tarnished for the next century at least
Those Russian talk shows on state tv channels are such dumpsters jeez
Actually every channel here is kinda "state" because they are heavily censored
So, our cucked-in-the-past former communist block members, Georgia that was not allowed to put genocide on Ossetians and always conspiring, always warmongering Angloes
Nothing special of a list
Pfft, I don't think anyone in this world likes us
That's a fucking shame
Hypocrites, russophobes and degenerates - how to describe all of rusgov, rus
tv and rusvatnics (brainwashed patriots)
I hope they all will burn in 7th circle of Hell
I'm russian
Does this mean I can't be friends with people from these countries anymore
I really hope people on this thread don't confuse the Russian government with the Russian people
It really breaks my heart that the situation is what it is :(
Congratulations
Because it’s «Россия 1». Fuck them and other state owned propaganda machines to damnation
A bunch of fucking hypocrites and liars - some of their employees happily own property in the UK, the USA and other Western countries and their children go to local schools/universities
One of their anchormen is an actual UK citizen ffs
I don’t consider any of those countries my enemies
Sorry, you are not trying hard enough
If you keep up the good work I’m sure it will happen)
I think Erdogan in the club of dictatorship so they used to  help each other despite them deferences
Actually poor
We are ask for this
And nobody else
Is not funny, is fucking cringe
I hope this russophobic bastards in rusgov will be suffer
It kind of makes sense from Russian POV because according to Russian officials we never do anything wrong ever and all of those accusations are fake news to demonize blah blah blah blah, you get the point
And sadly millions believe it too
Russia was never been out this cycle, and never will
Like, a normal one lol
Russia I used to read about in our own Consituition (the previous one) would do honestly
Even until 2014 things looked tense but kinda promising, civil institutions were somehow developing along with people's political awareness, there were hopes for real opposition gaining more weight etc
There were even public LGBT festivals, there were sex ed classes in my high school, it still wasn't ideal but it looked like it was all going to get better
And then a complete blackout, everyone is suddenly an enemy and the shithousery has begun
Sergei Brilev, there was a somewhat big scandal when his UK citizenship was revealed
But no consequences for him of course
I know, most people here say this all the time no matter what shit our government does, and it makes me glad
Yeah the situation in both our countries seems quite similar
Erdogan and Putin are almost identical autocrats, I guess that’s why they’re such bros (at least, in public)
Let them both go to some remote island and enjoy the company of each other, while our nations build some proper democracy to live in peace and prosperity
We deserve it, man
You guys have so much russians and ukrainians as immigrants, you want more
Sorry for a late reply
Not sure I can add much more than some other commenters already did
Especially democracy in Russia
Thank god you’re a foreigner then, because that’s one of the worst takes I’ve heard

Very disappointing how millions of people are persecuted in China for their religion with very few people speaking about it

Rise up against what
About 70% of our population either actually support Putin or genuinely thinks that he’s the lesser evil
As a Russian I tell you Navalny would not
He does great investigations on corruption in Russian government, but as a politician he's quite incompetent and self-absorbed to a fault
He's neither the "star", or an opposition leader - in fact, he refuses to cooperate with coordinated opposition efforts more often than not
He's been rising for what, 10 years already
It's true there's no one else who can match his popularity, but it is still in single digits
But be warned: you have to drink it right, or it’s poisonous
He is an alt right
brrrrr, panopticum
This photo is very unlike Moscow
Hell, it looks photoshopped to me

Proposals are trying to hit the most problematic areas
Strip mass surveillance or social credit scores of any AI technology and what is actually left
Cameras which record all data without any ability to pinpoint particular individual or event in easy and timely fashion
Like in many shops the records are fully watched only if anything extraordinary happens like a crime or even terrorist attack
Social credit scores which basically rely on some explicit rules which can be easily discussed and rejected by society
For example, if someone is a known sexual offender, society can consider him unfit for being a teacher
Now the discussion of such models is problematic because deep learning models are black box models and interpretation of how it gets specific answer is still the area of research
I think these proposals are actually good
Especially notifying part because people have to wake up and understand just how much AI tech influence our everyday lives
But the language is still vague and the industry would not like it a one bit
Actually article mentions the vagueness of the term
That is only leaked draft, so hope wording will improve before it would be revealed before public
But I think they should opt out of these technical and academic discussions and just stick to particular application
For example, you can freely use any algorithm for cancer cell detection but you can't just detect and identify faces on mass surveillance videos
Does not matter how you do it, keep all technical side to actual experts instead of politicians and the government
I don't know about others but in my case it is not about digital illiteracy
Fellow computer vision engineer here
I know how deeply machine learning infiltrated our lives
Yes it does compares to "let's ban the internet". Yes, you can say that there are some parts of site people click agree without reading
But basically there is a big social interest to make it less about private, murky conditions of service and more of the public regulations
Yes, it will hit industry on so many levels and people would have to deal with many businesses in the field losing profits and quality of service degrading
But in my opinion that actually worth it and people are just too comfy to properly to understand that data privacy actually means
At least we need part of notifying the people that some decisions are fully automatic with little human moderation
That would really help to raise digital literacy
I wish these MPs and the likeminded Poles all the best

Money from different parts of Russia, go to Moscow, so they can change tiles every year
Governors appointed by Putin to other regions force the same unnecessary repavent too, it's not about investing exess money but syphoning any money available to the paving tile business owned by right people

Most of the population concentrated in megacities, with the rest of the country slowly dying out
Decreasing the population in half would lead only to more ghost towns in countryside, without any difference for the megacities, except the lack of workforce to maintain them, which hardly could do any good

Medvedev, in fact, wasn't just a puppet, his internal policy was different to Putin's. He openly supported including the main opposition channel into the pool of free 20 digital channels
Also, it was all about nanotechnologies and warming relationship with the West on the news
And protesters had way more freedom to express their concerns
Imo the best president we've ever had

Luckily, smart people don't believe that changing one talking head in the TV to another is a reliable recipe for improvement
And Ukraine is by far the most shittiy country of these 3
&#x200B;
Development under strong leader, baby
[That's all cause he's not getting his natural gas]
I mean that credible ability to vote an unwanted politician out doesn't worth much on its own
Participant political culture implies not only that citizens are capable of changing country's leadership by legal means, but also that those citizens do understand important features that differ one talking figure head in the TV from another one
To put it simply: citizens understand the negatives and positives of the old style and therefore make path for certain changes
That picture presumes that Ukrainian political culture is better than that in Russia and Belorussia, only because none of Ukraine's president has ever been re-elected and has always been put out of the office under an avalanche of slander, booing and with a *Lame crook* ticket stamped to his back and a hefty bank account in some off-shore
I think that only proves that Ukrainian political landscape is swarmed by self-serving crooks who mainly care about making business
Whatever talking head occupies the TV atm is irrelevant to them and common folk rarely realizes difference between one and another aside simplistic propaganda cliche like *He is an oligarch X's puppet
She is a Z's lobbyist
He is going to sell Ukraine to Y*.

Because EU and world in general have no balls to stop our government, everyone is suffering

And it will get worse for Ukraine and Russia until there's no money left in Russia
Thank you very much for making all people in Russia = Putin supporters
Also we eat babies for breakfast
Why should I? I'm a Russian citizen, proud of my country
I'm just not dumb enough to think Russia = current corrupt government
You have a point but people are suffering in both Ukraine and Russia

It's not so easy in Russia
You can't just vote against current government
You can't protest
You have no power against the government, they easily can throw you to jail or asylum

Dictatorship ! Hooraaaaaay
Well
I get where you stand so I'll try my best
Those stereotypes you mentioned about Finns and Brits indeed do exist
Perhaps not without a reason
I would believe most Finns do indeed like sauna
The thing is - I don't believe most Russians want dictatorship to have a free reign everywhere and/or have some kind of malicious intent towards everyone(as implied by your words)
I believe that historically, for many reasons, it was harder for common people in Russia to fight for their rights vs elites than, say, in western Europe
I could discuss many reasons for this, but I'll leave it for another topic
Basically what I mean is that it takes more effort here to change something for the better
Elites here have (and always had) more power to ignore people's will
Stagnation leads to radicalization
So moderate and weighted decisions are becoming less popular and radicals and populists come to the fore
And among those people - there are many more people acting with a bad faith
So basically it takes some radical effort to change something, and when a change finally occur - it often turns into a chaos
In times of chaos when standards of living are drastically reduced and even some basic needs are not satisfied anymore  - leaders that offer stability (=basic needs satisfaction) at the expense of freedom and extra needs - gain popularity
People are willing to give them more power that they will eventually abuse
ignoring people's will all over again
&#x200B;
And it's very hard to escape this self-replicating system
&#x200B;
Sorry for a wall of text, but I'm just very sad when people imply that we're some kind of barbaric evil people, when in reality, based on my experience - there are so many different kind of people - bad and good, including many kind, open minded and loving people
I think it's just like as everywhere really

Not gonna lie, I find that ugly

No, absolutly

Trump talks about sanctions on germany for NS2, unleashing ISIS fighter in europe, fucks up market via tweets, block other from doing business in Iran, support climate  change policies
You hate russian and want others to be like you, but they arent and that makes you confused
Actually he did
The problem is that no matter how a referendum had been initiated, the West wouldn't have recognized its results, as it would be against American interests - they would definitely state that any Crimean referendum was illegal according to the Ukrainian constitution
Stating that a region was illegally occupied and then putting sanctions on the region, banning all international flights and making every possible way to visit or leave the region as hard as possible, is against that common sense, isn't it
It's like putting sanctions on Jews for Holocaust
If the region was truly oppressed and occupied against Crimeans' will, the US would jump out of their pants to open the borders, as it happened in the DDR
I'm talking about Crimea
Crimeans are obliged to get visas only in Ukraine, even though there is a constant risk for them to get persecuted both by Ukrainian authorities and nationalists for "separatism".
Again, if the West really cared about Crimeans, they would send official delegations there, examining the real situation, possibly discussing a second (or fifth) referendum under international observation
But they don't really care
There are some stories about Crimeans getting political asylum in Europe or US, but most of them are sporadic and tied to political activism
The fact of just living in Crimea is not enough - there should be any evidence of personal persecution - political, religious, based on sexual orientation, etc
So it's just basic rules as for asylum seekers from any region without an active military conflict
I dunno dude this European censore kinda sucks
Happy independence day, Ukraine

Did you just call my country USSR
We *fucking* wish it was that way
USSR is not that insulting
A solid portion of people actually miss it
There are many Russians who dislike commies
So they won’t be happy for sure
I don’t think there are people that want USSR back - maybe some elderly people, but that’s pretty much it
What many Russians do miss is Russia with the size, economy and power of USSR
So, for many it’ll be great to have capitalist Eurasian Federation without commies but roughly in borders of former Soviet republics
Many would even go so far to say that ditching Central Asian republics is clever choice and they only want Ru/UA/By/KZ to be together
This is a common misconception that's being pushed by russian state propaganda
There are already rockets in Poland and Romania, it doesn't mean that NATO is going to attack Russia
I Wish this happened in Russia
There’s also shit going down in Belarus
And there are also major protests in Khabarovsk because the local government was arrested for defeating the wrong party
And massive protests might spark here in Moscow too because the constitution amendment referendum was absolute bullshit
Man, what a year

Dude this is nothing
Seriously, what you see in the video is really nothing by Belarus standards
This summer, there were tons of videos of riot police officers throwing people on the ground and beating them with nightsticks
And not beating as if dealing a couple  blows so the person stops resisting, but beating for the sake of beating
NATO's kinda nice and all, and I consider myself a pro-Western, pro-NATO guy, but man, the level of anti-Russian toxicity in the comment section is wild, as if we're the ultimate bad guys and second coming of Adolf Hitler
So much for freedom loving
But it's Reddit, so it's not really surprising to see commenters with binary views on the world

Swiss neutrality worked before because they were armed to the teeth (still are, I guess, even if underfunded) and tripwired their country
Being neutral without military investments and proper strategy, just hoping things would be okay, that's the Belgian route
Sadly this is not how Russia is going to function in next 20 years at least, judging by at least modern history of USSR and Russia
I mean, I would not recognise the country, if Russians would actually turn their whole attention to domestic problems and fiercely protest their government over it
Yes but we are in 2021
Did you really expect that Russia would allow USA to put their military bases in Crimea, 1000 km from Moscow and Russians do nothing about it
It was a provocation

> Honestly, I hate Moscow
Call me a fake Russian
Duh, I guess most of the Russians outside Moscow hate Moscow (at least those that do are always happy to share their sentiment)
I believe even a sizeable proportion of Muscovites hate Moscow
So, people can call you a fake Russian all they like, but definitely not for hating Moscow
That's because our airports are very far away from center

There are poor people in Moscow, but there are no slums, and even the number of bums decreased significantly over the last 10 years - you can maybe see 1 or 2 near some metro stations in a week
I'd say Moscow is better than Paris by that metric

Not everyone is as fortunate with smart leaders, but get a lot of communist and feminist leaders instead
I think that it's linked more to TV becoming obsolete pretty fast, so only people who dislike innovations use it as a main source of news
Those people are in general more conservative, and as such the ultraconservative stance "we're really good, everyone else is out there to get us" is so prevalent on TV, because that's what conservatism looks like in Eastern Europe and the Middle East
I've seen some report about Russian TV popularity, which showed that the percentage of population who use TV as a first news source fell from 45% in 2012 to about 17% in 2017
I don't have a source for that report, and it might not be very accurate, so don't quote me on that, but here TV is mostly used by older people (over 50), while younger generations mainly use Internet (including Social Networks) as news source
At least, that's my theory
Yeah, my thought excatly
I meant that it's more subtle in Russia – they don't put the whole picture in the headline, they often use comparisons and associations to make a point, and only then they start to call names and stuff
Edit: note, that not everyone does that
I think Zvezda is the one that goes head on with everything, for example
I meet from time to time opinions like: "Russians are stupid because why they suffer their stupid powers
" etc etc with the final remembrance of de Custine and the conclusion that Russians are immanently the race of slaves
Like revolutions are such simply done, just take each other hands and in one chain go against everyone bad
You must
For Greater Poland
Are they still doing that
I heard that "Культура" ceased Euronews broadcasting

Poland national tv sings to the tune of Duda like if they were in North korea - 28 score
Cyprus has journalists get kill and burn in own car - 20 score
How the fuck do you pack france italy spain Slovenia  between those to
This ranking is retarded
Somehow I expected better from Czechia
They haven’t seen Russia yet
Yes you are correct
Oh , getting killed and burn in a car for revealing panama paper is "perception" and "gut feeling" now
And i though this ranking would be the most stupid thing i'll see all day, but its not even 12 and you already topped it
What a day
No coke before 11 am
Did your mother not warn you
Sure buddy
North korean news paper are also free to publish what they want too
That has nothing to do with intelligence or stupidity to have mix this up
ButYeah other called that mistake out already, you are kind of slow
Nice change of subject by the way
So it is still a gut feeling
Or you want to admit you were wrong
The singular instance i have pointed have/should have massive impact on the ranking
You dont get a journalist murdered every day do you
You dont have a national tv rigging presidential election every day, do you
Meanwhile, You have people in finland dying everyday, just like you have people going in and out of NK without dying everyday as well
So yeah i saw you were using sarcasm, but your post was so stupid that i felt it wasnt worth taking it out of the depth of misery it was in
Are you happy now
Wtf does it matter
You still have a national TV paid by tax payer money that is basically a propaganda machine
It is ok because it is not the only source of information
Big deal
That doesnt excuse anything
Also, im not russian and watching the state of polish democracy and press is pretty disgusting
You are not worth any more time
So you consider it ok that your tax serve as a propaganda lying tool
No wonder the country is fucked up
Most countries have one, but they do not glorify their leader like Poland does
Well well well
That attempt to roast is hilarious
The thing different with what you previously mention is that failing to have a proper press impact your democracy, when an over spending can be be stopped by voting
A failing press is the first step to dictatorship
Are you at this level of illiteracy
What part of "im not russian" did your fried brain missed
Lmao that makes you look like a moron now with all your garbage posted
You have alternative but you do not have proper press as a whole
This is dangerous because some
will believe their bullshit
This is basically a fake news official channel
Thats where dictatorship starts
Ok ok
If you always had it you mean just be used to
But you shouldnt
You should aim at stopping that because this is very dangerous
Fake news is very dangerous for democracy
There is a difference between a tabloid and a straight up lying press
Most democracies dont have lying tabloid simply because they would be prosecuted over it
The exception are UK and USA, not exactly good examples of democracies
Where can Lithuania go that the other Baltics can’t?
Lots of South and Central America as far as I know
Some islands like Philippines, Jamaica and Seychelles
Weirdly, South Korea and Israel and not for a short period of time
Some stamp on arrival like Nepal and technically China
If online visas count then also Mexico, Singapore, Cyprus, India United Emirates and some others
Those are the ones I'm interested in, anyway
I guess that this table doesn't consider covid restrictions, anyway
I doubt that this particular stat takes covid in consideration, really
Its not like entering or not entering under them is a matter of having a visa
Look at UK it can't be 130 currently in any way, they are like in a total lockdown

Welcome to the Internet, abandon all hope of a nuanced and educated discussion at the door please, that k you
Oh, and here's the Kool-Aid
(FWIW I've been able to have decent discussions, it's just that the majority of comments probably aren't worth engaging with
As far as i know they were sorted between Nazi Collaborationists and others then Nazi supporters got shot or prison time, while others were recruited to the Red Army effort
Obviously people who got uninvolved either during war or past war also got shot or prison time

As a pure Latvian, I agree
I'm kinda surprised by the big gap with Czechia and Slovakia

It's funny that a lot of people yesterday called the photo with dead Babchenko fake
I didn't take them seriously, but turns out it was a rare case when conspiracy theorists were right
Now that's a goddamn twist that I like
Nice
Now what
Skripal is alive too
I need more nonsensical news
Even a shovel shoots once a year
There are no magic or "supernatural" — only cutting-edge technology
I don't remember where I read this
But [for example] "A: Why I have feeling that it's photoshop
B: Unrealistic blood color".
People also noticed that Babchenko's last post in Facebook (he wrote that it was his second birthday, that exactly 4 years ago he didn't get a seat in a helicopter that was shot down) looked like a setup for faked death -- and it was true in the end
I have no idea how is it related to the things I've said
Babchenko himself said that he learned about the "assassination" from SBU 1 month ago, so he wrote that dramatic last post already knowing he would be fake "killed" that day
It seems you have some unhealthy obsession about Russians
And sure, the SBU story can be entirely made up
Certainly it would not be the first time SBU lies
While I have no reason to trust SBU, the story can be real as well, I have no opinion on that

We’ve been having a similar meme template for quite a few years
The meme is basically a couple of pictures with text under them which says: “Неповторимый оригинал:” (The inimitable original:) / “Жалкая пародия” (a pathetic parody: )
In this case, it would say “the inimitable original” under the Russian guy and “a pathetic parody” under the American guy
I assure you that our authoritarian government is very developed
It uses many advanced technologies and techniques, mkay

Also, first time in Russia (as part of USSR) homosexuality was decriminalized back in 1917 year by Lenin, and until Stalin came to power and recriminalised homosexuality in 1933 year it was absolutely legal
Yeah nothing's legalized in Russia

CRAWLING IN MY SKIN THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
In Russia we don’t have this tradition but we have Вербное Воскресенье (Palm Sunday)
It is celebrated the Sunday before Easter (this year in orthodox Christianity Easter is celebrated on the 19th of April so Palm Sunday was yesterday)
So the night before Palm Sunday people in villages would go around the village, knock on doors and lightly beat people inside the houses with pussy-willow branches while singing songs
The willow branches were blessed with holly water so this playful beating was supposed to give people health

" Belarus police captain resigns in solidarity with the protestors
Let's hope that a there will be no full blown civil war
Yeah, OMON is really shitty in both of our countries but it's still nice seeing officers from law enforcement side with the people
If this becomes widespread, OMON will be left alone and scared
I’ve seen some Belarusian riot police wet (edit: vet lmao) saying that OMON is literally the worst to encounter when you are protesting because they have the least restrictions
Less than the army, less than the regular police
So they are the most brutal
Belarus police
It was called this way in Russia as well until 2010 when it was renamed into poilce
Legacy of the USSR
Police
They had presidential elections a few days ago
Lukashenko (the dude ruling there for over 20 years) again decided to arrange his own pseudo-democratic victory and started with arresting all the candidates from the opposition
This time people were not having it
They protested for months despite pressure from the police, arrests etc
Still, the only major opposition candidate they actually registered was Tikhanovskaya, the wife of one of the arrested major candidates who decided to register as a candidate mostly of despair and the administration registered her thinking nobody would vote for her
Election day
All the shady stuff you can imagine, observers being removed, fake ballots delivered etc
People staying in line to vote
Approximate results where it was possible to count votes indepentently: about 70% for Tikhanovskaya
Official results: 80% Lukashenko, 10% Tikhanovskaya
They aren't even trying to look legit
After that shit hit the fan
People go protesting, thousands of protestors arrested, clashes with the police reported, Internet mostly shut down for the entire country, workers go on strikes across the country, Tikhanovskaya was forced to record the "please don't go on the streets" speech and leave the country
The quote in the title is from his own post where he posted the iimage
I'm pretty sure it means resignation
Below in the comments
He posted this on his Instagram (@jeghor, Reddit doesn't allow me to link the post directly)
I saw this reposted in the protestors news channel in Telegram
Less accountable when it comes down to specifically riot control
Don’t know if that makes it less scary, but IMO that’s important
Well, the army has lethal weapons
The riot police have rubber bullets, tear gas, flashbangs, water cannons, riot shields and batons, all technically less-than-lethal weapons
If you see 4 of them, they're on patrol
I live next to a metro station close to a few stadiums, so I see them on game days
They are normal in normal encounters (well, as normal as people who have chosen or are only fit for a job like this are)
I would be more wary of regular coppers on patrol than them
Even riot police
“Everyone I don’t like is literally Hitler”
“All the police are literally nazis”

People of Belarus deserve my support and the author of this garbage photoshop deserves my contempt
Am I the only person who prefers Belarus' current flag
I find it way more unique
Beautiful
People of Belarus deserve new elections without one seasoned candidate participating
Poor guys they have a couple days to retirement
Except that the law enforcement officers in the picture might literally be agreeing with the protestors and might be just doing their job guarding some government building or whatever without raping and torturing anyone
I mean you're right
I'm just saying design wise its much more unique
Look at the flag Lukashenko proposed in 1995, it looks like it belongs to a banana republic
real war heroes on the right are young, and on the left are veterans

Truth is poking in the eyes, eh
People in China think it’s a part of China
Nothing strange in this regard
The odd part is that CCP tries to push that narrative abroad, which can raise many eyebrows
> try to push it
Not only try
I lived in China for a few years and there was no one who claimed Khan to be other than Chinese
Many people even said that at the time , China was the biggest ever, from Korea to Turkey
And don’t get me start with magic war between China and Japan that happened between 1945-1949, apparently
I saw only 1 person who said that it was a Civil war (the kid had a father living in Sweden, mind you) and not a war between Maoist China and Japanese who (apparently) “didn’t know that WWII ended”.
As I said, there was literally one person who said it was a Civil war between KMT and Commies
99,9% of people I talked to told it was a war against Japan, China won and established PRC
China has no territorial disputes with Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan
Territorial disputes are those that are officially claimed by the government
Opinions of private citizens don't matter here
From memory, there were blog posts hosted on Chinese websites about their claims for Tajikistan and such
But if I write a blog post on livejournal how "Alaska is rightful Russian clay, gib back", or if hundreds/thousands of other Russians write similar posts, it doesn't mean Russia has a territorial dispute with US over Alaska
>And apparently, a journalist and a diplomat (Zhang Heqing) (political position, right
) were the ones claiming Vladivodtok
No, a Chinese diplomat in Pakistan tweeting about Vladivostok does not count as an official claim of the Chinese government
Those claims, aka the real territorial disputes, are well known
>No, but if a diplomat like, idk, Mikhail Galuzin made the claim that, it would spark some controversy and sour relations with USA
Aren't diplomats part of the Government
He's our ambassador to Japan apparently, I had to look him up
Depends, if he'll give an interview proclaiming Alaska is rightfully Russian (present tense), I'll imagine it will be eagerly picked up by the media
If some dude working at the embassy in Tokyo or wherever comments how "Alaska used to be Russian" (past tense), no I imagine it will do absolutely nothing to our relationship with the US
Cause that's what happened here more or less
"Zhang Heqing, a Chinese diplomat working in the embassy in Pakistan, commented “isn’t this what in the past was our Haishenwai
”, referring to the Chinese name for the area before its annexation"
>And if Japan was still controling South Korea and forcefully assimilating it on the basis of "common ancestry", how look would you think it'll take until it annexed North Korea
Inner Mongolia is internationally recognised as a part of China
It's a done deal, no matter if people find it "fair" or not
China actively working to assimilate ethnic minorities within its officially recognised territory might not be a great thing to do morally, but it says nothing about their plans to annex other countries beyond the borders they already claim
So no, in this case, assimilating Inner Mongolians does not mean the next step is invading actual independent Mongolia

i was at night, on a bumpy unlit road between towns and the driver was in a hurry

And I still can't convince my grandma that this, and the invasion of Hungary, were bad
She still brings up ridiculousness about how poor Soviet soldiers were lynched by the revolutionaries, and about CIA tactics of sniper provocateurs shooting at both sides ("just like in Ukraine
"), and something about a small bunch of East Germans dealing with Czechs really simple
wherever the Germans came from
And, of course, "We built the metro and everything for them, and they dare to rename the stations
" and some other arguments I forgot, but it's just weird
And all of that coming from a person who says she doesn't actually want the USSR to come back and now things are better
Our eternal shame
At least we had enough common sense not to let East Germans to participate - they were very eager
Hmm, didn't  regular Osties wanted revenge for the Sudetenland expulsion
> It wasn't a revolution, it was a coup
Like literally all revolutions ever
What is typically caled a revolution is a chain of coups where creators of the initial one don't survive to see the end
February events in Saint-Petersburg were a military coup obviously
Sabotaging city supplies > activating revolutionary cells on the fleet for the officer massacre > physically arresting the emperor and getting renunciation (or falsifying it)
Now I know the history of French revolution worser but same technologies can be easily seen there as well as general treatment of "revolting mass" as cattle being manipulated
To the point where it's considered the start of "anger of masses" is storming of the Bastille
Bastille was a prison where 7 prisoners were contained: 4 counterfeiters, 2 crazy ones and one pervert
Does satanic pornography of de Sad represents the will and interests of the French people
What’s the point of trying to create a positive image when you’re the one who’s being attacked

Who said so

Something that is default in the penitentiary sustem when dealing with people who have committed violent crimes
Sorry but what does bird country mean lol
I mean, I could’ve guessed it based on context
I’m wondering why is that
I just don’t know what the reference is based on
Like, kebab makes sense, because kebab = turk stuff
But why bird
WHY THE FUCK DOES BIRD COUNTRY MEAN TURKEY
I understand that it’s a joke
I don’t understand the reference itself
Edit: yeah I feel pretty dumb now
So bird country is a name for turkey because it’s a wordplay from Turkish language or what
How the fuck is bird country a wordplay for turkey
Yeah I’ve been told by the other guy already
I feel fucking stupid now lol
Hopefully we will join it and kick the ass of these turks

По подробней можно?
Нужно понимать, что правительство любит использовать троллей не только и не столько за рубежом, сколько в местах интернет обитания россиян.
Можно зайти на любой популярный ресурс, даже на русские сабреддиты и заметить похожие по смыслу сообщения;
Навальный - агент запада.
Никто его не поддерживает кроме радикалов.
Протесты ни к чему не приведут.
На улицу выходят дети, которых обманывает оппозиция и провокаторы.
Это основные посылы. Я более чем уверен что очень многие подобные сообщения и комменты написаны ботами либо людьми, которые поверили в эти небылицы.
Personal sanctions against all of the senior government officials and Putin's cronies
Not some generals who never leave Russia anyway and don't have any assets abroad, but ministers and billionaires
Some of these are already sanctioned, but there is a long list of people who could join them
Economic sanctions against government controlled companies may be effective too, even military industry in Russia uses a lot of foreign tech and can't really function well without being able to buy it
[был бы человек, а статья найдется]
Many people don't like him to begin with, and they're just delighted to see anything bad happen to him - maybe a bit like some left-wing people in the US might enjoy watching "nazis being punched in the face", or how some right-wing people in the US might enjoy watching "libtards getting owned", but multiplied by 10
I think many Russians don't exactly love nuance when it comes to this kind of stuff and prefer a radical and emotionally charged approach
Which is also evidenced by the fact that any discussion (especially political) on the Russian-speaking internet is basically way more crazy, anger-filled, polarised and aggressive than an identical discussion on the English-speaking internet (which is one of the main reasons why I spend my time on the English-speaking internet, frankly)
Certain Russian people just tend to be super opinionated, forward, harsh and not very compassionate when it comes to people they dislike or disagree with
That's just how I see it, anyway
Ugh, have you been stuck in 2010 with this shit
He never was a member of an ultra-right organization and last time he even publicly cooperated with Russian nationalists was before 2013
It's a screenshot from the latest Sunday protest
It a famous quote that says something like "as long as there's a person, it's not a problem to find a reason to convict them" (but in a much more consice and clever way), effectively foreshadowing this court process
If you know that he ever attended Russian marches, you should know that he publicly stated that he wouldn't attend the one in 2013 and never did so since
Stop shilling
Isn't it more to describe that everybody is sinful, rather than the prosecution can prosecute anyone if they need to
Doesn’t mean that his radical nationalistic views changed
Just imagining us joining makes me smile
Probably wouldn't happen in my lifetime tho
Such a shame that our government tries to indirectly (through media) whitewash this (and the Hungarian) invasion
"They were pro-NATO fascists, something-something everyone was actually happy". And ask any Putin supporter, they'll be happy about the invasion too
As a Russian I’m sorry that such a thing happened in our history
We, ordinary people, never wanted this and had to struggle with this oppressive regime on our own
Please don’t forget that despite the dictatorship rule and hard punishments some people actually came to the red square and protested the invasion
Maybe because it has nothing to do with actual russian people, lol
Also Putin has absolutely nothing to do with this
I hate Putin, but come on, have some historical accuracy
There is no mercy

Yes and adhering to the five pillars of Islam is the absolute minimum to be considered a Muslim, yet here we are
People often declare a certain religion for identity reasons and not because they practise it in real life
Check out Navalny's poll from 2015 in Tatarstan and Dagestan
Lots of people declare themselves as Muslim (40%) or Christian (36%) in Tatarstan, yet many of them admit to not really follow some very basic tenets of their religion (namaz, ramadan, fasting, etc)
Dagestani Muslims are also kind of lacking really in their practises
>People are often members of churches even if they don't believe
That's not how it works in Russia
What you've got is people declaring a certain religion for identity reasons and not because they actually practise it
We can compare it with the biggest poll on religion we had in Russia  in 2012
56 900 respondents, which is really huge for a poll
Chechnya and Ingushetia were not polled and those are the most Muslim regions in Russia, so Muslims should be adjusted up  (Chukotka and Nenets AO were also not polled, but they are absolutely tiny)
Russian Orthodox: 41%, Christian: 4
1%, Other Orthodox: 1
Muslims (without Chechnya and Ingushetia): 6
Pagans: 1
Buddhists: 0
Spiritual, but not religious: 25%; atheists: 13%.
5% who can't decide and some small fries like Judaism, Catholicism, Hinduism and so on, each accounting for less than 0
5%.
No, I don't think so
The main goal of this poll was to find out how Muslims in Russia feel about Russia's intervention in Syria
So they compared Tatarstan and Dagestan because Tat has some of the most secular Muslims in Russia and Dag some of the most strict ones
Tat also has a big share of ethnic Russians (Christians), so they were used a control group
Along the way the 3 groups, Muslims/Christians in Tatarstan and Muslims in Dagestan were also asked some interesting questions about observance
How often do you go to the Mosque/Church, how often do you pray, did you fast in the Ramadan/the Great Lent, how do you feel about Sharia courts and so on
Well, no
Because it's a question of identity and not religiosity
Among other factors, there are various ethnic minorities in Russia that can be quite involved with their traditional pagan beliefs
Like Yakuts, Ossetians, Altayans, Mari
Do you speak Russian
No other polls I've seen of this nature
But there's the break down of chosen religious/secular modules for Russian 4th graders on a regional level
There's some regional variance, where Tatarstan doesn't offer any religious modules and Chechnya *only* offers two religious modules (Islam and Christianity)
But there's still a noticeable correlation between the regions that are more and less religious
Nothing comes to mind, sorry

In fact, we do
Most of Russian hard swear words (мат) branch from a small amount of roots so we have huge amount of variations  with prefixes and suffixes
For example
ебать - to fuck (someone or something, literally or figuratively) or can be used as an expression of shock (like “holy fuck” or “OMFG”)
въебать/ёбнуть - to punch/hit (well, not exactly “punch” cuz you can въебать with your leg or with a hammer but you get the idea)
съебать/съебаться - to get the fuck out
выебать - either “to fuck someone” (literally) or to win a match (sports, online games etc
разъебать - to break/crash something (like a car), OR to crush someone in a debate (разъебал по фактам)
Ебашить - to work hard OR to be moving quickly
Наебашить - to beat someone up
Наебениться - to get shitfaced (drunk)
Объебаться - to get high as fuck (on any drugs, but usually not weed cuz we have other words for that)
Ебануться - to lose your marbles, to go insane (also can be used to express surprise/shock)
Et cetera et cetera, and those are just the verbs and with just one of the roots
Or, as for the word “dick” - хуй - we have tons of words too
Хуёво - “badly”, “that sucks”.
Охуенно (sometimes spelled ахуенно) - fucking awesome
Хуета - bullshit
Дохуя - a fuckload
Нихуя - jackshit
Нихуя себе (often shortened to нихуя!, хуяссе!, or just хуя!) - holy fuck
I know, right
I’ve seen this blog before, and that’s the case for all its maps
I’m certain it’s a deliberate exclusion
Of course not
Every one of these words is a hard swear, it’s just that there’s probably not enough English analogues for them
No, they aren’t accepted like normal words and are as “hard” as the original
Most of ours swears are “swear-emphasized” normal words
It’s not like there is a swear without a normal non-swear version of that word with the same usage

Russian Empire was too underdeveloped to be totalitarian
First years of USSR weren’t totalitarian
Last few years of USSR the state affectively stopped being totalitarian
Modern Russia isn’t totalitarian
So, apart from the period between 1925 and 1985, Russia has never been totalitarian

Russian oligarchs have problems with buying yachts there
Political talkshows are pretty much daily, so whenever the hosts wanna talk about it, they might as well update it daily, yeah
my favorite part is that russia is like 'these countries are unfriendly', so obviously the best course of action is to 'take measures to influence their actions'. Cuz of course, its the other countries that are the problem lmfao
I guess in any time, any era if Russians dictator want to make some list of their enemues, then UK is guaranteed to be there
There can be many reasons in a moment, but it all comes to soviet boomers' deep resentment towards western ex-Soviet countries and ex-Warsaw Treaty Organization members as to, and I quote a very common stamp, "ungrateful" traitors who "willingly ran to serve" Russia's adversaries "when we were weak" to threaten and to weaken Russia even more
That's a mindset which is not going away, unless naturally, and the goverment is happy to use it
The more these countries act against Putin, the more boomers believe that Russia is in a circle of enemies, the more they support Putin
They believe that this is as obvious as that the sky is blue
Let Russian opposition be Spider-man, please
He's raising a difficult questions and not trying to lecture the same time - this is a skill that most of EU politicians is lacking
It's stuff like this that makes me ashamed to be Eastern European
Get your shit together Czechs and Hungarians
Why do Czechs take pride in this
If I was Czech, I would be embarrassed by the map
I genuinely read most of this thread thinking he died and wondering why people were so fucking rude
lol
The last Russian poll on the topic of mixed marriages I've seen is from 2010, so it's been a while
The question was basically 'what would be your stance towards a close relative marrying someone of the following ethnicity'?
Marriage with a Jewish person - 10% positive, 37% neutral, 46% negative and 7% D/K.
Only majority positive results were for
Ethnic Russian - 70% positive, 26% neutral, 2% negative and 2% D/K.
Majority negative results
Chechen - 5% positive, 23% neutral, 65% negative and 7% D/K.
Arab - 6% positive, 23% neutral, 63% negative and 8% D/K.
Central Asian - 6% positive, 27% neutral, 60% negative and 7% D/K.
Georgian/Armenian/Azerbaijani - 7% positive, 30% neutral, 54% negative and 8% D/K.
Ukrainians and Belarusians - 37% positive, 45% neutral, 14% negative and 5% D/K.
Latvians/Lithuanians/Estonians -  14% positive, 43% neutral, 35% negative and 8% D/K.
German/French/English - 17% positive, 44% neutral, 33% negative and 7% D/K.
Americans - 14% positive, 41% neutral, 37% negative and 8 D/K.
They were lumped together in the poll, so there are no separate numbers
But I imagine that since Armenians and Georgians (probably wouldn't be much difference between the two) are Christian, they would score higher than Azerbaijanis if polled separately
Still, there are some noticeable cultural differences between Russians and all three South Caucasian ethnicities
So I don't think the difference would be that dramatic
Well, there are still a lot of cultural differences between us even if Armenians and Georgians are Christians
Including the fact that Caucasians are, well, more patriarchal and traditional than Russians
In this poll Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis were also all put in the same category
The 2008 war has not left a deep mark on the Russian psyche (I'm guessing it's different for the Georgians)
Like at all
Armenia is obviously seen as a more friendly state than Georgia
But as far as  how people are seen it hasn't changed much
Maybe Armenians are perceived more favourably, but the difference isn't pronounced at all
I've looked it up and according to a poll by Caucasus Barometer in 2015, 48% of Georgians approved of their women marrying Russians vs 46% who disapproved
Comparing with poll on marriage of women to Americans, who should be their bestest friends after all the conflicts with Russia, and it's at 42% approval vs 51% disapproval
Well, if the whole tumor has been eliminated, and no metastases exist, it can be considered cured
But in many cases it's really hard to eliminate all the cancerous cells
Aww yiss Alpine part was the best during my cycle tour
Russian-Polish history in a nutshell:
Give land

And then there is half of Siberia burning and Russian government doing close to nothing about it
It is understandable why is he begging for money from our beloved dictator
He wants to keep his power for as long as possible and Putin shares his interest
That’s why he just took 34$ out of every Russians pocket and handed them over to his friend in need
Oh by the way, the Health Ministry of Russia reported that there is not enough money in the budget to provide for necessary medicines against AIDS and cancer
Wouldn’t it be better to give this money to Russians in need
No, of course not
Putin will help anyone but his own people
These armchairs are Putin-sized and Putin is a manlet
Luka is what, 193cm
Of course he's going to look awkward sitting in one, no matter what pose he takes
Lol, they'll ask for our help

Ha-ha, looks like Russia fucks Ukraine and Belarus looks at this party))
Россия be like
In biology, it's called anaphase
Glad to hear that, usually I get downvoted as hell in this subreddit
A threat
like this one
[November 2013, Western Ukraine]
Here the [same] but more impressive
"Hang a Russky" - this message was well heard in Crimea
Holding back in what
Not supporting the old song of the Russian threat
Or providing video proofs of what Ukrainian nationalism is
You guys don't hesitate to put your rusophobic puns everywhere
Now go and tell how you hate Putin, not Russians and how Crimeans would be happy in Ukraine after the coup d'etat
I don't watch Russian TV or read Russian state newspapers, I mostly read oppositional Meduza (and used to read Lenta before its chief editor left), Vedomosti, as well as BBC, Telegraph, Independent and DW
So no, I'm much more familiar with Western propagandistic machine
All your assumptions are based on Western and Ukrainian propaganda
And I have Odessa fire in May 2014 and entire Donbass to imagine what would happen to Crimeans without Russia
The moment Ukrainian mobs overthrew the elected President, thus violating the Constitution and other laws of pre-Maidan Ukraine, Crimea, as an autonomous republic, decided to protect itself from the chaos
It was the same Crimean parliament, elected according to Ukrainian laws, who voted for Russian protection and the referendum
Moreover, about 70% of Ukrainian military units based in Crimea chose to take the Russian side, while others left the peninsula peacefully
Isn't it a bit strange for a military aggression
Anyway, Crimea is open to visit
You can visit Crimea any time after the pandemic and ask locals, if you still believe that all pro-Russian Crimeans in Internet are Kremlin trolls
Btw, you could also ask them how they feel about water and electricity blockade by the Ukrainian regime
I already provided a proof of russophobic sentiments in Ukraine in 2013, before Donbass and Crimea - you preferred to ignore it, but they were students, not even Right Sector radicals, so russophobia was quite popular in 2013 among young Ukrainians
In last 6 years Ukraine enforced a number of Anti-Russian measures, including the total prohibition of Russian language as a primary language at any schools, while keeping this option for "EU languages". Now young Ukrainians write hate comments with awful mistakes in Russian, while Ukrainian minister of education writes in bad Ukrainian
Everything I see and read here is full of passive or open aggression towards Russia, Russian heritage, Russian history and Russian language
Seems like a good Russian for you is someone who despises his own people, his country, his language and his history
This is awesome
I've looked up articles written by this author, he is a total lunatic, USSR is basically his infallible God
I find it a bit amusing that you highlighted only that small part of the text when the whole site with the TV channel combined just teeming with bullshit like that
I don't know where you get it from, but nothing like this appears in the Russian media
Historians cannot find any proof that the incident happened at all, so it hardly can be considered a false flag
And a [one] and a [two] - not full-scale campaigns, obviously, but still
And no, I don't believe Finland started the Winter War, however I do believe it could've been avoided if not for the stubbornness of the Finnish government
Well, that's what you did in 1941
Finland at that time did seek a strong ally for a war with the Soviet Union
Preferably England, but Germany was fine too
This
To expand on it a bit, it's not just any hardcore commie-imperialist type of total lunatic
It's a person who calls Stalin **"a future saint of Russian Orthodox Church"** [[here, enjoy] calling for his complete and total rehabilitation
That's a level of craziness that even most of the conservative brainwashed Russians would find over the top
You stories of the Russian propaganda are in fact the Western propaganda
They look ridiculous when read from this side
In the 90s the soviet aggression was admitted and taught in schools
Maybe that's reversed now
Fortunately for the Finns, unfortunately for the 600,000 citizens of Leningrad, who were starved to death due to the Soviet Army's inability to remove the Finnish threat
Zvezda is state-supported though
Yep, that's what I'm speaking about
It's not the only time I see this absurd notion, I've seen freaks with icons of Stalin, and they pop up from time to time
But they are a marginal group, for it requires to reconcile so many contradictions in their head, for their idea of great Russia, I can only give two variants, either they're not honestly caring about anything except pushing their agenda (which is very reminiscent of the post-truth concept), believing that post-modern world has no place for such measly concerns, or are absolutely "not in touch with reality" (or both)
A very stylish photo, at first I even thought it was a poster in an old communist design
This sounds like such a holy and great moment
Remembrance of such events is very important and I'm glad the War is not forgotten yet
How do you find yours and how is it not stolen
I've travelled around Germany by bus and it's nowhere near a rare occasion
You sure can
Searching for a bike there would be hell though
You never know if it's been stolen
How much of this is true and how much is just a joke
Like, I live in West Siberia close to the Arctic Circle and +30°C is kinda fine with me
I guess that's true
With swamps all around, the only real issue is dry air, especially at winter at cold temperatures (I could barely breathe sometimes ffs)
Also, can someone send this warm weather here
It's mid-May and it's still hovering above 0°, it's annoying to see rain and snow on the same day
Don't cry, daddy is here
bruh is it okay to make an r/2balkan4you joke in here or
Ah yeah okay then
whiskered bastard
Stop making up crazy stories for a photo taken before the war
Your sick fantasy has no limits
The idea of Stalin as some sort of all-powerful dictator is definitely one of the stranger myths that has recently sprung up
He did not have any more formal authority than any other member of the Central Committee, other than the fact that he became the People's Commissar of Defense during the war against fascism and he held the military rank of Marshal
You would think that if he were a dictator he would have been able to dictate policy, but it goes without saying that that was not the case as there were so many famous examples of decisions he disagreed with being made
In terms of contemporary leaders, both Churchill and Roosevelt held more power in their respective states than Stalin did in the USSR
Edit: people are downvoting the truth now
Pathetic
Never thought I would downvote you, Enai
Ironic coming from a pole
They came really close to taking Moscow, as the front was collapsing along the Kaluga road, the holes in it were plugged with literal cadets
It wasn't a cakewalk for the German either, but with Moscow in their hands they would control the railroads running north to south, really limiting our logistics, not to mention the blow to the morale
Why downvote someone who's celebrating the Ninth of May, the Victory Day, the day when Nazis were kicked in their butts
1941 and 1812 were completely different eras
Electricity, telegraph, railroads were all routed through Moscow
Which means that our (Belarusian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Russian) heroes returned on the 9^th to tell their families "We won
Lol, what
We are literally a dictatorship
I’m fairly certain that the poll numbers don’t match reality
Most Russians didn’t even vote in the last election, because it’s obvious that Putin will just rig the whole thing and cling onto power with everything he’s got
2012, 2018, and 2019 protests were brutal
My city elected an anti Putin mayor (I guess the regional government is at least somewhat democratic), the feds swooped in, bullied him into resigning, and now we no longer have a right to vote for a mayor
My city is only governed by appointed puppets now
We still protest and petition to this day, but there’s no actual democracy in sight
I mean, if the Russian government isn’t to be trusted internationally, why should it be trusted domestically
>countries like ... crimea
a fresh take
Oh i see, blessing everything is not only a Russian tradition
Is it Cyprus in the middle
Putin’s enormous palace in Southern Russia
[More information about it
It looks neat, it’s just sad that it was built illegally for that thief
I mean, Germany is small, it will take you 5 hours of driving with your fancy autobahns
Just go there
That kapusta probably has a little bit extra kick to it now that it's expired
Also TIL Poles also call капуста kapusta
Some stores around me finally started doing this and I have no idea why it only starts happening now
It seems like a win-win for everyone tbh
Flight ban, nuclear ban
He's a burger, common sense is an alien concept to them
That's the joke
If that huge thing on the right is Russia then statistics is kinda outdated, since it has been 8+ years since the government started paying you when you get a second child and classes had increased in size up to 30 per class and in number, up to 5-6 classes per school enrolled each year, rather 3 classes 20-25 each, as it was when I entered primary school back in 2005
They used to be extremely popular where I live, I still love them
These guys made it world wide
I think I mostly remember the video games from childhood
This video is very interesting, but that guy is fucking crazy
True, I suppose
Rly want to die
This is not the kind of red that I'd like seeing on a map
no you aren't
This map is based on wrong predictions though
I remember seeing these numbers according to WHO estimates, I guess they "estimated" not much would change in Russia on the suicide front
Russia's overall suicide rate was 15
6 per 100k in 2016
(12
9 per 100k in 2018)
It's at the level of various Western European nations now and the numbers just don't break with the ones on the map
We endorse your proposal, we need sun too
it was a joke about Russia being number one if you look at it from another perspective; I don't care about karma as long as a few people get the joke, so let them downvote
The economic transition from Socialism to capitalism was a complete disaster and economically many post soviet economies still struggle
The troubles afterwards have created strong cultures of poverty
Yakuzas doesn’t give a fuck though
Well, at least one of them attempted
The last Mrs
Fuck MS Excel date
Russia, US of Europe
I think there were three in just, like, this year alone
I guess it depends on what you count as a shooting, because there was an attack involving hatchets, if I'm not mistaken
I think it might be pretty ununiform distribution in US, with gun nuts owning multiple guns and people without any
It'd be interesting to look at "armed men per 100" statistic
You meant libertarian
Oh, so Belarus and Ukraine managed to participate zero or so wars since WW2
It's beautiful
Congrats Latvia, I have always had a soft spot for you :) really hope that story we'd had stays it the books and never comes back
good luck with your independence from your watchful neighbors up north (russia)
Isn't Portugal quite cool at summers
Man, Germany is GOAT
Does it really
I see nothing relating to it
I'm disappointed it wasn't a trebuchet
That's a good one
Just look at the Albanian flag lmao
Looks legit from far, but just zoom on it
Happy birthday

This looks basically like our new library in Halifax, Canada !
I remember my Grandma always made sure to have food on the table and more tucked away
And you never ever throw away bread
Also this [story] I read as a child was first brief look at how starvation can change people
Not a part of EU but Russia stands with you
Except for our 20 million muslim population, but don’t mind them they are wacky
Yay
I've been there
But not on the bridge itself because there were a lot of tourists
I would love to live in old town those huge wooden doors are gorgeous
That's bad, right
It has to be bad
It looks like the protestor need just a bit more of enthusiasm like I'm Ukraine
Maybe bring an ally of Russia wasn't really good for them
Just remember when, or rather if, Belarus people wins and Lukashenka is remove from power, there will be more problem like Ukraine
When Ukraine switch leader, Putin comes in
It can be another Crimea accident
I fear that our president he will do whatever he can to help Lukashenka or even remove him himself
If they storm government buildings, Russia starts actively participating
Putin said that
And also they may get shot by the police
So that is not the way they should go
I honestly don't see what can be done there as long as Russia continues helping Lukashenko in various ways
Unfortunately it's left from the USSR and Russian empire
There's no culture of democracy in Russia and Belarus yet
It's something of a propaganda trick both Russia and Belarus use to explain why are people living in such bad conditions
For Russia these "external enemies" are the US and Europe, for lukashenko they are Poland and Lithuania
It used to work some years ago but now people understand that no one gives a thing about their swamp
Is this some kind of joke or are you really trying to advocate Sharia law
This comment is retarded
From us either
Feels so good to be a country where freedom is valued
Do them on WC itself, lol

I’m from Moscow and it’s kinda same here
Keep in mins that I said “Moscow”, not “Russia”

compositionally seems too perfect with the worker and kolhoznica projecting movement forwards and upwards contrasted against the monolith of the nazi pavilion - immovable object and an unstoppable force
It doesn't, this map is a load of bullshit
There are 268 "places" (cities, towns, villages) with 1000+ pop in my region yet this map shows only ~60-70
The highest score of negative
I feel proud
As Russian, I am actually glad how much British dislike my country
In recent years our government has done so much seriously messed up shit
It is not surprising that some Russians like me hate it but we are robbed of pretty any chance to be finally heard and make a difference
It seems that just like in Belarus, Putin has lost his senses and would protect his grip on power even at cost of thousands of innocent lives and mass application of brutal force
Just writing this to remind that not all Russians approve our government
LOL I knew we're gonna be last XDD
very proud to be russian /s
Meh
[r/Russophobic]
You call this hate
Thanks
But here you will get a lot of dislikes for this comment
wow, you surprised me
I never expected a Brit to like us
Thank you
But only because of the Eurotrip
I totally agree
I remember talking about that with different people in Europe, from Britain or from other countries and usually they state that the negativity is towards Putin, not the people
Can't blame them
True, but to be fair that case is very intricate and honestly I don't believe there is a solid evidence of Russian involvement or the contrary
All our points of view are relying too much on propaganda from both sides
Few months back there was a poll about introducing changes in Russian constitution which would among other things would allow Putin to hold his power
Officially it was called referendum but there was a lot of controversies surrounding it including eliminating all public control to ensure its fairness
By official numbers around 21% were against constitution changes and the opposition produced estimate that actually 45% were against
Both numbers should be taken with a grain of salt but it shows that even the opposition see that they are not overwhelming majority
Still even official numbers show that government critics are not just some miniscule minority
Did you know that colours of Russian flag can be spelled as 'krasnyi'(red), 'goluboi' (light blue) and 'belyi' (white)
And the first letters of these words form KGB
****tinfoil intensifies****
Once I told my grandma that I’m going to Canada, she asked isn’t it dangerous for a citizen of a WarPac country to travel to a NATO country
She’s aware that there is no Eastern block or USSR, she just used to call certain regions in certain ways and just doesn’t feel the need to change her vocabulary
I guess many people who travel to Czechoslovakia are also just used to say it instead of Czechia
I have long lost my faith in humanity
People constantly draw connection between ideas and the person who said it
For example, find some inspiring and reasonable quote from Hitler and see how everyone would lose their minds
Still it is just tip of iceberg
For starters look at list of logical fallacies on Wikipedia, I think there is around 50-60 positions in it
And the go for cognitive biases and there is like 200-300 of them
I just gave up on remembering them all, human intelligence is so flawed it is not even funny
Your only hope is to learn more about that and spread the message
I don't want to argue on a subject I have little true information about, my point is, no solid evidence of usage of nerve agent or the involvement of Russia is published
To be fair, I'm not saying that Russia wasn't involved because no solid proof of that either
So all negative attitude is mainly because of propaganda
True or not only time will reveal

Greetings from Siberia, Russia
God damn what the fuck is going on there
Why
Poland but
in Russian
In Russia the same situation
I live near Moscow and 25C is good weather now, not so hot))
I’m not even scared anymore, my scare receptors are all fried out
Between the whole world going to hell and Putin pulling a Xi Jimping, I don’t even feel anything anymore
Idk
Why yes
Now it’s weirder so it makes more sense to me now
Lol I thought it's Russan but with a weirder looking ш letter
But still, why is it in Ukrainian now
What’s the deal with writing the name of your country in a different language
Yeah that makes sense
Oh my god, that face expression is priceless
Bryansk strong
Is that law actually stops them, though
I mean in Russia any promotional calls made without your consent are illegal, but those spammers just aren't under our jurisdiction ot something and basically call whenever they want anyway

You should replace vodka with Recursion for extra class
Recursion is a simple, but tasty cocktail: one part vodka, one part Recursion
Takes too long to make, though
Poland is slowly being overtaken by Latvians and Belorussians
This is so stupid
I love it
grain vodka > potato vodka
I've cycled from Munich to Rome this August and can confirm Italian part, though I don't speak Italian I knew few words (Buongiorno
Si, coretto
) and learned some during my trip
Even simple lines like "succo di mela, grazie" (apple juice, thanks) made people smile
For Germany I was told Bavarians appreciate if you speak the language and if someone didn't speak English well, I tried my best speaking German
I think the whole idea of Germans speaking English is formed by "Ordnung muss sein" ("there must be order") cliche
Like, this person needs something, let's not confuse him with words he may not understand

Most Russians actually support their government and especially Pitun
During Leningrad blockade in WW2 people were able to distinguish cannibals by their shining bright eyes
Everyone else were dying of hunger
Not most Russians
Wasn’t 1915 considered as a dark year too
The same happens everywhere all the time
It's stupid to dwell on it
Hold on
Not so fast
Its been only 30 years since the autocratic rule started by Ivan the Terrible ended
They are able to break into your house during the night because you have posted something insulting on your page about the milit
police, senators, something containing swastika or something positive about terrorism
So unless you are a total dumbass, who shouts extremist or outraging things publicly or you pissed autocrats off so much they watch every step of yours looking for a single miatake, or unless you don't use SSL when write antigovernment things, you can sleep peacefully
Yep
Indeed its an imperialistic culture like China or the UK has
But unlike the UK, China and Russia are unfortunate because they suffered significant damage both physically and to the pride
He got lucky
The oil prices in the 2000’s were high, giving him the economic leverage to exact his plans for dilution of the public consciousness
Up until recently, people associated Putin as an anti-liberal, pro-economy guy
The 90’s was a tough time for virtually every Russian, and people wrongly accepted him as the answer to the chaos that preceded him
Putin didn't actively make things worse (before 2012-2014 that is)
Of course the overall positive economic trends did the bulk of heavy lifting, but not interfering with natural progress is the best one can expect from a Russian leader
In case you didn't know it, we have had about 1
5 competent ones over the past 500 years, and all the years of USSR were a particularly nasty shit storm
A lot of fairly reasonable people support Putin because compared to the likes of Yeltsin he does in fact look like a saint, and Yeltsin is far from the worst leader we've had
Yes, we now have oligarchic rule including by actual oligarchs
Breaking news: Putin made a statement, that Russia will be annexed by Mongolia, for economic reasons, certainly not to avoid joining EU lol
At least we could relate with the sudetenland germans now
Legalised abortions in 1920
Even though they were heavily restricted in '36, they weren't completely banned, and were completely legalised later in '54-'55
This or last year Russia introduced financial help for people who have only 1 child
(it's weird to phrase in English, I know) And doubled it for 2+. Before you got financial help and some privileges if you had 2 or more children, now even 1 gives you some of those which is nice
“How dare people brag about making the world a better place
Oh yeah literacy was a problem during Tsardom
Only noble or feudal children were allowed to attend Univercities, peasants could only attend 1st grade of some low-quality schools
I'm not very hopeful; I think he's a populist who craves people's approval first and foremost
I don't expect him to actually hold any principles he'll stick to
If he delivers a hard Brexit I'll be satisfied
It's just a case of holding out until October, I suppose
But I don't see how he can do any better than May did - she shafted the whole thing with that election bomb
Im laughing but i know our polititians are worse
> n the context of Brexit it highers the chances of a no-deal (because that's still the default outcome) if things won't find a faster gear
For me to be satisfied, that's all he really needs to do - stay in power long enough for that to tick over
I don't trust him any further than I could throw him, though
The man doesn't hold any principles he'll put before his own popularity
She had hope she could make a difference to help the country she loves
Everyone can understand and respect that
I dont give farage and Bojo that much credit
She faced more pressure than most leader will ever experience
She held the fate and union of her country in her hands against the biggest union of countries, with no preparation time
Name another leader who did that
Words have meaning
I know, in USA, that not always the case anymore
You happened to use yours to undermine her quality as leader because she was pressured
It is simply ridiculous
>heads of state or government have had to deal with much bigger issues than Brexit
Oh they did
Funny that you saved yourself the trouble to name any example then
Get back when you will have anything worthy to add
Two paragraphs and still nothing interesting said
If you are not going to back up your claim, that is ok to not make any at all
Mass falsifications in all major elections, evidence of which is on the Internet, but everyone doesn’t care about it

FWIW you still won most of the fights we had after
Well an argument could be made that neither was Russia/USSR in either war
In both, we were heavily dependent on western countries sending us materiel
And in WW1, we got sick of it -- sick enough that we listened to Lenin and co
And yeah, I don't even have to elaborate on the state of training for the average Russian conscript
We still did well enough

When you got your shit together you kicked ass
You live in a crumbling wooden house built by your grandfather when this area was still a village
It has electricity but the water needs to be gathered from the well
You wake up early in the morning and walk to the bus stop that looks like a Fallout prop, so that a bus produced in 1980s can take you to the equally old warehouse where you just carry various crates and sacks around until it's time to leave
It's the end of the month, so you receive your paycheck
It's approximately $200 but you need to survive for the entire month on it
If things get bad, you can borrow some money from your friend who got lucky to be employed as a mechanic and earns $300
Anyway, time to buy some food and take a bus home before it gets dark
You sit on the rotten sofa you inherited from your dad, pour yourself a glass of vodka to forget your troubles and turn on the TV that you bought 15 years ago
They are showing the news program
The president, sitting in the middle of his golden palace, for the 20th year in a row tells you that the country will soon become the leader of the world economy
You feel that your throat starts to ache
That's bad but it's already too late to go to the hospital and they would just either give some aspirin to you (that you luckily have at home) or that young naive doctor will prescribe you that modern shit that costs a quarter of your salary per 10 pills
You are not legally considered poor
Lol, thanks guys
That's the nicest thing anyones ever said about us
Orwellian means total control
This man can go around calling Putin swine all day long
Nothing will change in his life
Which is horrible enough
Not that meme again
Yeah, it's happened to me a few times while travelling
My "active" vocabulary in Russian would get too repetitive and limited, and I would sometimes use an awkward turn of phrase
Felt deeply embarrassed because of it
I guess, it's because I am surrounded by my native language's environment all the time
But probably even if I wasn't, I would still not forget my mother tongue
It's a mother tongues, after all
When you study other languages sometimes constructions that these languages use may pop up in your head earlier than they do for your own language
That can be really annoying at times
Sometimes I end up saying words in a weird order like I've only learned how to talk yesterday because of that
I'm not even from Europe and my first language is Russian but I'd say yes
Not that often as people might imagine but it happens
Especially when you know that you might say a sentence way shorter but you gotta use your native language cuz nobody in your group of people would understand English
The mother tongue can still be forgotten if you don’t practice it
I am not competent in this, but I think, though can't say for sure, that this is probably relevant only for children, not for adults
Yes, it depends at what age do you move from your country, but anyway without practice you will get bad
I think that I neither like it, nor dislike it
I just accept it as one of those unique things that make me somehow distinguishable from other people who speak English
My accent is not immensely strong, though
Probably, if it had been stronger and if it had been harder for other people to understand my speech because of it, I would have seen my accent more pessimistically
One thing I learned from this thread is that hating the typical accent of your country seems to be a universal thing lol
I find Icelandic accent absolutely majestic (as well as Swedish, Norwegian and other Scandi ones), in fact, the thicker the better, but apparently native speakers don't enjoy it much lol
It's an interesting pattern
In a weird way it makes me feel better about my own accent
I mean, you never know, maybe some people in some country somewhere actually genuinely love it lol
Bc iphones (at least newer ones) cost a fucking fortune
The most popular phones here are cheap chinese stuff for under 20k rubles from Xiaomi, Huawei and what-not
I don't know does it counts, because this city in asian part of Russia, but Russia is still European country so
I'm ashamed of Omsk
This city is ugly, dirty, people are too agressive and this is one of poorest cities
There are some other cities like Vorkuta, Chita and Magadan but they are not as popular as Omsk
Serbia isn't even the poorest country in the Balkans
Albania and Bosnia are both poorer from memory
Alcoholic suck up to busy trying to be in charge than actually doing their job
Security guard who sits at the front desk and watches you fumble with your keycard
Some find him creepy, but he insists he's just doing his job
I always believed stereotypes were real
I expected everyone to have a shotgun and eat burgers lol
I honestly love Italian food traditions, I think the whole pizza for one person in only common in Italy:)
As is the “no cappuccino after noon” rule
See, you are open to sharing in theory:)
First time huh
Nope
Im fully sure that Azarov and company were just paid by building companies
Graveries of ancient turks- bulgarians are being desecrated too
Ok im adding Werhaboo to my list of awesome insults
I think in Russian it would be "доброжир" (dobrozhir)
Literally this means: dobro - good/kind, zhir - fat
But "zhir" part here means "plenty/so much".
So dobrozhir named person is very kindly
P.S. We also share lots of old Slavic and old Byzantine names with other Slavic countries
So there is a good chance that you find some similarities
Names that end with -slav or -mir (Svyatoslav or Vladimir for example)
For the UK
Godfrey and Gladice
Hmm, I'd say Yaropok for men and Zlata for women
Miroslav isn't that old timey
I know two people have this name and are alive
Be ready to get your economics devoured by China and USA
Salmon is easily my favorite fish for sushi
Flounder is a distant second
Same shit here
Also "Ukraine bad" etc
I have two favourite pieces
The first one is that they have forbidden speaking Russian, which is funny, considering that ≥50% of Ukrainians speak Russian with family and friends and that even their president doesn't speak Ukrainian well
The second is that they have invented their own version of history in which all humanity is descended from "Ancient Ukrs" which suggests somehow that Ukrainians are the purest Aryan race
Yeah, I know about the first one, although it would not be feasible in the Eastern regions where most of the locals speak Russian almost exclusively
Anyway, it's not "forbidding speaking Russian".
About the second one, it's not taken out of the blue
There are a few Ukrainian nationalists who propagate this idea, but our media takes it to a whole new level by stating that this is accepted all over Ukraine and that they teach that in school
I not know about what to talk, so here excerpt from "Master and Margarita":
>Any visitor, if he, of course, was not at all dumb, getting in Gribojedov, at once savvied, how well live luckies - members of MASSOLIT, and black envy started immediately torment him
And immediately as well he addressed to sky bitter reproaches for that, that it not awarded him when born \[with\] literary talent, without what, naturally, notwhat was and dream to take possession of MASSOLIT ticket, brown, smelling with expensive leather, with golden wide border, - known to all Moscow ticket
Original:
>Всякий посетитель, если он, конечно, был не вовсе тупицей, попав в Грибоедова, сразу же соображал, насколько хорошо живется счастливцам – членам МАССОЛИТа, и черная зависть начинала немедленно терзать его. И немедленно же он обращал к небу горькие укоризны за то, что оно не наградило его при рождении литературным талантом, без чего, естественно, нечего было и мечтать овладеть членским МАССОЛИТским билетом, коричневым, пахнущим дорогой кожей, с золотой широкой каймой, – известным всей Москве билетом.
Not very understandable how to translate cases and forms of verbs - to ignore them or to use prepositions (how, usually, and do when translation)
Don’t think that this is a good idea because from trying to think like that my brain hurts
I decided show cases in own example-preposition
Onexample, yesterday when I exited from gym-birth, me self-arrived go home under rain-create
I obliged was buy TV guide-blame for my MIL-birth, but I went straight home
While today rain-birth no, (it) was worth would outspring out home-birth on minute and buy it-blame
English not perfect language
At him no some aspects of speech which is at other languages
As example, at him no cases and endings of Russian or other slavic languages
For me easy show this, that is in English, but no in Russian, but difficult show this, that no in English
May be, Latin be would more appropriate example
Honestly, this much more understandable, than that, that write Dutchmen
You clearly not follow rules, because you is/have articles
You where found articles in Ukrainian
They are only in Bulgarian
If natrix write on-own, then on-own
Lingua latina non penis canis est
Articles - invention of devil
Peoples of world should together fight against this language plague
Everything normal, and then bam - New Zealand
>We should it over of everything and still something could have
Too many auxiliaries, I nothing not understand
Why you them so many
We in Russian without them somehow live, and nothing, everything normal, understand each other
Reverse-translit, that's what i like
If everyone else boycotts, it's the only chance to win with our national team's level :(
We had this guy called [Viktor Chernomyrdin] Idk how much stupid things he'd *done*, but he *said* a lot of ...stuff, like:
* I won't talk much, or I'll say something again
* We always can to can
* It has never been like this and now it is exactly the same again
* If I'm a jew, what am I to be shy of
I'm, however, not a jew
* We will be destroying our nuclear weapons together with America
* We completed all objectives (points): from A to B
* There was no war
There were only questions
* Forecasting is a difficult thing, especially when you're talking about future
* I have approximately 2 sons
* Teachers and doctors want to eat almost every day
* There's a catastrophe in Yugoslavia
Catastrophe is always a bad thing
* We wanted the best, but it turned out like always
And much much more, he has a huge article on [Russian Wikiquote] Sadly, there are just 3 quotes on the English one
"We have no money left but hang in there" — Dmitry Medvedev said this in front of people in 2016
Former (Prime Minister and President) of Russia
Well we do stereotype Germany as a place where anything not explicitly permitted is implicitly prohibited ;)
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a right wing politician who is considered our Donald Trump, called Condoleezza Rice a *“a black whore who needs a good cock
Send her here, one of our divisions will make her happy in the barracks one night
She will choke on Russian sperm as it will be leaking out of her ears ... until she crawls to the US embassy in Moscow on her knees
Yes, this is a direct translation from his [Wikipedia] page
[Here is the og video
That was shot in 2003
For some reason this didn’t ruin his career, he’s still in the Duma TODAY
There is an article in Russian Crime Code: Article 210

You may get up to15 years of prison
Could we refloat the Victory, load her up with paintball cannons and send her off to clobber some dons for a second time
It became an idiom in Russian
Hell no
That's the place I dream of visiting
Also the birthplace of tons of great musicians
Haven’t heard of him
If such things were commercially viable, they'd attract investment
Given that even the UK doesn't have proper high speed rail (despite the government trying to push it on us), I can only assume flights are more economical for tourism
And high speed rail isn't necessary for moving freight
You don't even necessarily need speeds that high: overnight transportation in a sleeper coach is as close to teleportation as you could get, plus you save on one night of hotel costs
They are not mutually exclusive, thankfully
The Moscow-SaintP rail in Russia sees a ton of traffic and has both high speed and sleeper options (although the cheapest sleepers take 10+h as they tend to sit on the side rails letting other trains past)
Maybe
I just like to sleep in coaches so much that I would take overnight train even if the high speed one was the same price (and Moscow-SaintP is a shorter route than Berlin-Paris)
It's also quite hard to fit high speed trains into the rail schedule riddled with commercial trains that generally don't go that fast
But whatever, trains are amazing anyway
I never find it
Sometimes I think that Russians don’t use Reddit
As for Russia, there are no such ads I remember (almost all charities in Russia are focused on saving poor Russian children), but there is a long-lasting stereotype about starving African kids
I believe ads about African children would be met with aggression and annoyance in our society
At least when Putin aids some African country, the common reaction I witness is "How dare he spend money on others when people's lives here are so bad
I think ignorance can be explained more easily: people just don't hear anything about what's going in Ghana
I have to admit I know absolutely nothing about Ghana and never had any motivation to learn either
Only Moscow and St
Petersburg live fairly well, and to some extent other large cities like Novosibirsk, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, or Nizhny Novgorod (where I live), but they are already significantly below Moscow and St
Petersburg
The rest of Russia is a complete disaster for the most part
All polls show that the main concern of Russia's population is economical well-being constantly going down, and even events like Crimea annexation have lost their positive effect on their outlook
Some statistical info: the official median monthly wage in Russia is ~€500, 20 million people (every 7th Russian) live below the poverty threshold (~€150/month)
Every 3rd Russian can't afford a second pair of shoes, every 4th Russian has to cut their food expenses
If vacation plans are any indication: 80% of Russians don't travel anywhere, only 4% travel abroad
Some people live in horrible conditions in ancient crumbling buildings with no amenities, e.g. [see this post] from Arkhangelsk (unfortunately, I know several buildings in a similar state in my city)
Also, the quality of life is not only in personal income
I'm a wealthy person by Russian standards, I have sufficient money for almost everything I want (except real estate), but you can't buy good infrastructure
The infrastructure is simply garbage in most cities and towns
Horrendous public transport, streets always covered in sand and dirt, absolutely no regard for low mobility people: that's how I would describe my city, the 6th largest one in Russia
Free healthcare is crumbling under lack of funding, almost all people who have money don't ever use free healthcare
E.g., [read about the experiences] of a dancer from Iceland who is married to a Russian guy in a Russian hospital in Penza
And [here] some photos from a hospital in wealthy Moscow
And some personal experiences: when my grandmother was hospitalized with some heart condition, she spent several days in a corridor because there were no vacant places in rooms
The same happened to my close friend, except the corridor was in addition horribly cold
And in his entire one month in the hospital, he took a shower exactly zero times due to being disgusted with its state
And this decadence is seen everywhere, in education, in public services, and so on
Poorest: voids around Moscow and St Pete, especially Ivanovo oblastj (used to have lots of textile factories, couldn't beat Turkish imports) and Pskov oblastj (next to Estonia)
The richest are Moscow, St Pete, southern Russia where the agriculture is and the cities in Siberia built around oil/gas fields and metalworks

I couldnt pronounce it right untill 17
Its just black speech for me
It's a bit of a typical one to throw around on Reddit, but as a native speaker I was surprised that we have such a specific verb as "defenestration
Also, does it have a German root
I can see a relationship with a particular German word there
"Blowjob" - I thought it's about explosions or something
I think at some point they just pretended that it is a word but they liked it and decided to keep
On twitch channels get banned for this, but in russian guess what
Its a racial name
So yeah you cant say a name of the race
Isnt it racism
Вехикл)
I pronounced it in childhood like this
Depends on culture/language of whom you communicating with
In English it's better to stick with paradigm of no to N word
"Стул" is for actual chair without backpart in Russian
And also used for feces
Табурет! But it's like стул but without backpart
Я был типа: зыс из а рэд вот это вот слово
Since Twitch is presented in Russia, they have own staff/mods here and full Russian localization - they should
In Moscow it is only getting colder
I envy your weather so much
Maybe winters aren't so harsh but we have the longest and shittiest 0-10 C Autumn/Spring
\+27
Just for sure
This year I saw New Year decoration about a week ago
It was mid October
Troodos
There is mo anti-German sentiment
There is some generally anti-western but not specifically anti-German
Edit: I hope I’m not being too optimistic lol
Not really
Germans are seen as sincere, hardworking and no-nonsense people, which are all very attractive traits
They are easy to communicate with and conduct business with (in contrast with Latin Europeans and Asians, for example) I have come across people who have expressed their dislike towards Germany, but they are few and far between
Commodities produced in Germany are known for their quality and so are the services - education, medicine, etc
People are, however, aware of the anti-Russian sentiment present in Europe in general, and in Germany specifically
No, not really
Younger generations don't care too much about history
Older people have mostly moved on
There's a lot of WWII-related dick waving, but it's not specifically anti-German, despite slogans like "To Berlin
" on cars
There's a lot of envy, though, "these Germans have their shit together, while we can't do anything properly".
I live in uptown Moscow and if it wasn’t some fever dream that I had, our alarm systems are being tested sometimes and they sound exactly like what you’d expect to hear when there’s a nuclear ICBM incoming
And I was hoping that you’d say that you ended up getting laid
Bummer
The fact that Absolut is Swedish and not Russian isn't really known to a lot of people surprisingly
I guess because the noun is identical in both languages
Russia: 5
1% from every salary is paid to the fund
Healthcare is universal, but good luck if you're living outside big city: there may be simply no doctor
Or, there may be no drugs for your disease
Or, you may have orphan disease and doctors will say they can't do anything but IRL it will be because drugs will cost too much
Medical staff salaries among the lowest
Funding is shady as fuck
There is a lot of ways for corruption
Wanna see a surgeon, well you can't, because they scheduled prior to 2025
Personal experience with Russian healthcare:
They managed not notice meningitis despite specific rash
Free wards look like there was no renovation since the building is build, wanna some basic comfort like warm room
Pay extra
Had to remove a toenail: three weeks of pending, six months after the surgery had to be redone in paid clinics
Dentists: you just go to paid clinics cause they have a choice of anaesthetics and modern stuff
Even if you live in a big city, there's two weeks queue to visit a therapist
If you need to be hospitalized sometimes it's up to two months queue (it's like that in my 650000 citizens city for gastroenterology and neurology)
Did a checkup in December, photofluorography thing in my clinic was broken, I was sent to another clinic but it didn't work there too
I thought fuck it and went to paid clinic
>Or, there may be no drugs for your disease
But there's a shit ton of magic pills like Arbidol, Kagocel, etc
Who the hell thinks Finns are Russians
It isn't just an Anglosphere thing
I always find it funny when people on Reddit say "only Anglos do X" because most of the time it's far from true
I've tried to describe the situation in Russia, but I can't put it well into words
So a couple of unstructured remarks: many people say hello, many don't, and it isn't a big deal
Oftentimes, the staff actually greets you first
And there are many situations where greetings aren't expected and where not saying hello is actually more polite than doing so
And I've had the same experience in a lot of places in Russia and Eastern Europe
So, if a Russian tourist doesn't greet a shop worker France, it isn't because they lack manners
They just don't know they're expected to
And they can feel awkward saying hello in a foreign language, which adds to hesitation
> I've tried to describe the situation in Russia, but I can't put it well into words
Yeah, it's complicated
If the shopkeeper is doing business with another customer: definitely no greeting, I will greet them when my turn is up
If the shopkeeper is just talking with another customer and I don't know either of them: definitely no greeting, or they might interpret this as "shut your trap and service an actual customer"
If it's a self-service grocery store where a single till is right next to the entrance, definitely a greeting even if the teller is talking to someone
If it's one of these mini-markets where there are multiple small shops in a single room: definitely no greeting until I reach the counter of the shop I need
Talking to a supermarket cashier: definitely a greeting before saying anything when I reach them, but not when I enter the store
Talking to a shop assistant hanging around a large supermarket or a department store: an "excuse me" is fine unless they are manning an information kiosk, then a greeting is better
I would say that Ukrainian understandable for Russians on 70-80% from the beginning and after a couple of days of hearing 100% understandable
Speaking is completely another thing
Or being a North Korean who doesn't like military parades
It will survive, if you add russian gene
Not really, I did say that my great grandfather was killed in 1939 by a Finnish sniper to random Finns on reddit outside of any context a couple of times but that’s about it
A lot of ppl pray
Un-fucking-ironically
Божынька памаги мни здать екзамины!!!!!!!!!!

Cocainum is a meme
The other guys speak more or less right, but have a very strange intonation, that make it is sound completely foreign
Didn't know that they were Georgian
The first one might be going for Gerogian accent
But they all make vowels sound too long
This is very common for Europeans and Americans
We don’t have mountains but somehow when I am in the mountains there is an urge to do it
I assume digital piracy
Everyone who knows how to use a torrent pirates
Nobody is ever punished for it and nobody ever feels bad about it
There were attempts to block torrent trackers, but it is easy to bypass with a VPN
С новым годом! :)
Finally, there will be no questions about Christmas (hopfully)
Too late
To leave like an Englishman (to take English leave)— to leave without saying goodbye
I think the French came up with that
Американские горки (literally "American small mountains") is a Russian name for roller-coaster
I've heard that some countries use the same phrase, but with "Russian" instead of "American".
And we have “Chinese literacy” meaning “It’s all Greek to him” in English
The same in Russian
Every single movie with Russian protagonist from Hollywood
They rarely do bother to have a good russian actor
I can’t understand a single sentence of Asian who speaks English
Their English accent is so tough
And if we’re talking about Russian language I have never misunderstood foreigner or never thought that he speaks another language
Maybe because Russian language is unique and it’s hard to mix it up
In movies/tv shows when someone who doesn't speak Russian, has to say something in Russian, it's almost always gibberish
They replace McDonald's workers with janitors mostly
If you will not study well, you will go to the plant or become a janitor
That's right
McDonald's jokes are reserved for humanities graduates
The President is not some master strategist with a cunning plan
He's a gambler who is usually very lucky
That is it
I had to explain to a group of junior highschoolers The Soviet union collapsed in 90's. They actually thought the Soviet union was still going
We don't have toast 'Na zdorovie'. Na zdorovie is a polite answer on Thank you
Like
\- Here is your \*something\* / Вот твоё что-нибудь
\- Thank you / Спасибо
\- To your health / На здоровье
Drinking toast is "Za zdorovie" - "For the health". I have no idea where foreigners find information about "Na zdorovie" but everybody repeat the same mistake
To be honest, it's often described as going *through* Berlin, not *around* West Berlin
And even fewer people know about the other wall that separated the GDR from the FRG
I’ve had reindeer carpaccio
Medvedev ragequit like a week ago so for the moment, the other one
I know that Romanian and Italian are similar to each other
Is this right
Based on extremely dodgy math which includes Soviet casualties in WWII in Stalin's total death count
It's between Canada at the top and Mexico at the bottom
Alaska is next to Hawaii, in two boxes to the left
I think Germany made a really good choice on mandatory vaccinations as it could stop plagues from happening . I think mandatory vaccination is a life saver as vaccines give you immunity to diseases that are already cureable from an early age
Hot dog is called "Sausage in dough" in Russian
Unfortunately, the form used means dough is spelled just like father-in-law
The result is
In Russian Institute of protein is Институт белка, where’s белка is genitive for белок (protein) since word белка has another meaning, we was the only country with Institute of squirrel [source]
Deathproof movie in Russian is called “Доказательство смерти”, which means “proof of death”
English and Russian translations from Turkish resorts are a whole other meme category here
This sounds better than "Смертестойкий" imo
It is father-in-law who has sausage in him
Can't argue with father-in-law
That was like 10 years ago or more
Google Translate was very poor even 5 years ago
But the name ”Доказательство смерти” doesn’t have anything to do with the movie
Deathproof is a really silly movie and “Смертестойкий” or some other option would fit it a lot better
I haven't checked the news yet, so that's the first time I hear that
I hope it will lead to a better future for Kazakhstan
Though it seems that he still will have plenty of power as the *leader of nation*.
Why did he resigned
There is a very rare achievment fro ruling for 30+ years
>but even actual ethnic Russians don’t really face it there
Yeah, as someone from a Russian/Korean family that left Kazakhstan in the 90s, I'm gonna say no to that
Things have mellowed out since then and Kazakhstan is the best Central Asian country in that regard, but there's a reason overwhelming majority of emigration from Kazakhstan is Slavic
Also, Kazakhstan is building a nation state, so their desire to keep people who aren't ethnic Kazakhs far away from power is completely logical and I don't fault them for that
But you can miss me with all that non-discrimination talk
Yeah I think party tourism would be annoying
I’m glad that the places where I lived all my life got a better class of tourists
Obviously biased, but I always like going to the Russian memorabilia stores
Just because I like to see the version of Russian culture that is presented in other countries
3 posts later: It's time to reignite Finnish-Korean hyperwar
I just googled "русские рождаются с" ("Russians are born with"), and it showed [exactly this question] from 13 years ago:
> They say that Norwegians are born with skis on their feet
Then what are Russians born with
The answers:
> With love for good books, good ballet and matryoshkas (traditional Russian dolls)
> With a bottle of vodka
> With a bottle of vodka
Too primitive
Russians are born with a great Russian soul
(there's a cliche concept of the "Russian soul" that basically captures all peculiarities of Russian mentality)
Lmao, yes it is
There's no way it can be discussed other than with vodka at 2am
Yeah, I've seen/heard the same comments from foreigners, but I didn't know it was specific to Russia before that
Reading is really encouraged here, and someone who doesn't read/hasn't read a lot is considered a bit uncultured
The piano and fine arts are also mildly popular (not that everyone is into that, but it definitely seems more common than in most other countries)
It is only a little popular
Basically everyone knows how to play chess, but only a few have a habit
According to my grandparents, when they were young, virtually everyone would play chess
That's because we didn't have mobile phones back then
How is the relationship between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in BiH right now
Are there plenty of inter-marriages, or do people stick to their own ethnicities
Damn
There are many
But let's say Chelyabinsk or Omsk
To me it literally looks like a regular town lol
You guys all tripping
I looked up all the 'ugly' cities mentioned in this thread and they all seem perfectly cute to me
Bella Italia indeed
Same in Russian
Glina sure sounds like a fun place lmao
I liked Kharkov
I'd say Vorkuta
[Chita] comes to mind too
What does the first article of your constitution say
Ours is
> **Article 1**
>The Russian Federation - Russia is a democratic federal law-bound State with a republican form of government
>The names "Russian Federation" and "Russia" shall be equal
And personally I find it very funny that naming goes before anything else
Post inspired by the guy who has "Russian Federation" instead of "Russia" in their flair
[Full text of our constitution here]
Is there a lot of them
Yeah, I remembered seeing a similar question some time ago
Figured it has been enough time since to ask it again
Plus, it's not really the same question, in many cases answer to it is a preamble, not the first article
Nah, the Soviet one of 1977 is better, [the preamble is something]
I had my understanding of race shattered when I had a portugese and turk side by side and the turk almost fit in the Russian definition of white while the portugese would easily be seen as black or at best a gypsy here
Permanent population of depressive far northern cities like Vorkuta
Awful weather, valueless property and health problems if they still manage to somehow move to the south
Yep, looked up their real estate market, found a studio apartment for roughly a thousand euros
And very decent flats for 400-500k roubles (5-6k euros), even the furniture I saw in those photos could cost more
Fuck, there's no way out, even if you own a place, you can't sell it to have somewhat okayish start anywhere else
i was looking for russian's comment just to make sure that someone mentioned checnya, but you didn't. Vorkuta isn't even close as bad as southern regions
Same tbh
Well, they're different and the majority there is probably fine with it, it may be weird from our perspective and also given those terrible human rights violations, Russia is pretty messed up in that regard but it's still like comparing Finland to Saudi Arabia
Russian laws do not work there, 99% of us would feel like foreigners there, we just cannot relate
But depressing places like Vorkuta, Chita or Magadan is a different and close matter
Yeah, Chechnya is definitely at the top of my list
So much blood and violence and now they have this disgrace of a tyrant there
Russians claim Chechens to be their country mates it at the same time to not provide with federal law and protection against the Kadyrov clique
But if federals roll with full force again in would be seen for everyone as invasion again
Damn if you do and damn if you don’t.
Major and recent event that often flies under the radar is  [  . It wasn't just constitutional crisis - it involved tanks and snipers and machinegun fire with over 180 people killed
As a result Yeltsin blasted the Parlaiment (then still Supreme Soviet, so it was the end of Soviet rule) with tanks and pushed through constitution that greatly expanded his power
Many say that this event forever undermined Russian democracy
However Yeltsin was supported by most world powers because they feared return of commies
Yeltsin's popularity steadily fell after this event and first Chechen war, and in 1996 elections majority voted for communist party, but Yeltsin and his team used many underhanded methods to win the election, which was probably the nail in a coffin of Russian democracy
Ever since power has been held by the same group with no prospect of change
Thanks to Victoria 2, I know that
Lol i learned who Borbrikov was from song "Niet Molotoff"
While there are no false statements in your comment -- indeed, there was a war, and Bolsheviks had to throw away their idea that workers of every nation would help them fight the bourgeoisie in future wars, -- your comment creates an impression that the warmongering USSR attacked Poland, while it was the other way around
I agree that England's treatment of the Irish is something that should be more widely talked about, but I'm going to echo the other reply in saying that I don't think Brits look to Cromwell as a hero nowadays
I imagine a typical Joe Bloggs' thoughts on Cromwell would be "that grumpy dour bloke who wanted to be painted warts and all and tried to ban Christmas, right
It was an interesting time
I always liked the sheer variety of opinions - like in Ukraine alone there was half a dozen factions
In Poland there were nation-state supporters and "old commonwealth" supporters, on Russian side there were Reds and Whites and local peasant uprisings and "brigand states" with petty dictators and puppets of English/French/USA/Japanese interventions and then you have ethnic nationalists on the outskirts, home varieties of reds and whites in Finland and Baltic states, German freikorps joining the fun etc
The whole "Collapse of Russian Empire" topic is underrated AF
Yes
But it has become quite obsolete, unfortunately
The only way to play it nowadays is by using mods that improve gameplay
Yes, i was like "Who is that Bobrikov
This is not true
Yes, China was quite volatile from 1911 to 1949
The original battle royale
We have a language inside our language
Swear-word language is so rich that you theoretically can live entire your life and don't say any non-swear-word
I suppose that builders very near to this theoretical limit:)
Russian has something similar, called “toska”
in France they do that too
Of course I mean only verbs, adverbs, adjectives and nouns
Your phrase could be told like that may be:
"Попиздовали с псиной срать"
In theory, you can
It is the same in Russian
But dual form is before five
1 стол - 1 stol - 1 table
2 стола - 2 stola - 2 tables
3 стола - 3 stola - 3 tables
4 стола - 4 stola - 4 tables
5 столов - 5 stolov - 5 tables
6 столов - 6 stolov - 6 tables
Etc
Actually, I don't know but there is a couple of tricks that make this task possible
Word херня(khernya) -  it means literally everything you can imagine(no matter concrete or non-concrete)
The only thing you need to give more context with your gestures or other words so that it is clear what exactly you are trying to say with this word
Linvo-phallic reduplication
Add хуй-(or хуи-/хуя-/хуе-) to any word
The most famous example is the song of the Leningrad band - Yoghurts
"Сникерсы-сникерсы, сникерсы-хуикерсы. Баунти-баунти, баунти-хуяунти." (Snickers-snickers, snickers-khooikers, Bounty-bounty, Bounty-Khooyaoonty)
In real life, anybody, of course, will use a work park in your example but in theory, he can say it without this word
I'm so happy for your country now
But O-Zone is from Moldova
Istanbul
It even has "islands" to be unlocked
Chelyabinsk, the Vice city of Russia basically
A vast amount of cities which could be the location for GTA 6, but I would like it to be some of German cities
London or Paris are banal for this role, but it would be great to mention Hamburg/Frankfurt/Munich/Düsseldorf
It would be much better if whole GTA 6 will took place in Europe and missions will convey from one to another country
It would be some up-to-date move
I'd pick modern-day Saint-Petersburg
Venice or St
Petersburg or Amsterdam
More canals
Moscow would be great
Such a rushed and disappointing ending; really felt like the game had just run out of money
And the main story didn't even seem to use 90% of the landmass; I thought I must be less than halfway through the game and it just
finishes
Arbat street in Moscow
It was the only pedestrianized street in the USSR for a long time, and it has nothing special to offer these days
Just lots of gift shops and street artists preying on tourists who haven't updated their knowledge of Moscow since the 1980s.
I don't drink vodka, don't have a tracksuit, don't listen hardbass, don't drive a lada, don't play cs:go, I didn't even hack american capitalists
So, I guess I'm not very good at being a cliche Russian
I have a simple haircut, don't smile at random strangers
I don't drink vodka or tea, don't have a dashcam, don't like banâ/sauna, don't go crazy with venerating our WWII vets, don't have a tracksuit
Well, I'm into chess and figure skating, I drink A LOT of tea, the household I live in has a cat (and so do households of most of my friends)
But perhaps the most Russian thing is that I love picking wild mushrooms
It might not be a widely known cliche, but it's a fact that most Russians couldn't care less about politics, and I mostly share this attitude
I really like buckwheat and eat it every now and then
And I also drink tea all day long when I'm staying at home not going anywhere
Apart from that, I can't think of anything off the top of my head, though there could be more, for sure
> don't have a tracksuit
You can't be *that* uncultured, can you
>  suffered from the Soviets and I'm not a Russophile
Soviets and Russians are not the same
Wait, is the kissing stereotype really a thing in Italy
I have to admit, I've never heard of it before
Apparently, the imagery of Soviet leaders has left quite a mark on the collective Italian mind
When I want to watch a rug, I switch to [Kover TV] (Rug TV) channel
Red Sparrow comes to mind right away
It's like someone wasn't notified the Cold War ended and decided mix the biggest stereotypes about Russia, excessive romance and Jennifer Lawrence into a film
It's always gloomy and snowing in Russia, everyone's either a spy or almost a spy ready to die for the Party and for some reason there are still communist banners and that shit all around the country like it's still the USSR (according to the film it's supposed to be modern day Russia)
It's not that the film is bad per se but it's so full of that cringy stuff that it's difficult to watch
We even have the term клюква (klyukva) for all that stereotypical portrayal of Russia abroad
But Red Sparrow is like beyond the regular cringe - it's so bad in that regard it's almost comical
But I'm certain there is a whole bunch of films and tv shows like that which is something we kinda have to get used to, sometimes it's even funny like in John Wick
Turns out there is a site about Russian culture for foreigners and they have [some kind of article about that]
There's been a minor shitstorm on Twitter about Anastasia, a recent direct-to-video(?) movie from Disney where the eponymous daughter of Nicholas II escapes through time into 80's America
She's portrayed as clueless about civilization as Ariel the mermaid
My personal disfavourite move is Air Force One with Ford
Hitman and Die Hard 4 and whatever number that Rocky movie had are laughably bad, but AF1 manages to portait Russia as an American puppet state whose leaders are willing to break their own laws because the US is in trouble
They should have used grey filter to make everything look run down and depressing
Half of those stereotypes are quite valid
Yeah, but much of this urban development is semi-derelict brutalist accommodation that looks like a prison
Like, many soviet schools, public buildings, hospitals, summer camps, dormitories etc
look like this
To begin, there is no Finland at all
There is just a Baltic sea
That Stalin didn't know about Gulag
His inferiors concealed it from him
In handwriting almost everyone here writes "α". I personally write "A", just smaller in size, and the same for the other letters
They used to do so
until our president decided to joke a little, too in 2014
Of course I have, really wish Belarus all the best
Armenia is democratic now, while being Russian ally
Kyrgyzstan is also pretty democratic at the moment while also being in the Russian sphere
I don’t know why you think Moscow gives two fucks about political system in the country
The only thing it wants is for the elite of the country to follow their lead
Especially if we are talking about Belarus, where Lukashenko and his authority arguably were the only roadblock in front of Russian “reincorporation”.
I am reading all of this and I start to get the feeling that America is stuck in the 60s ideologically
Like everything that I read here is what I would expect from a film telling me about 20th century US
Fear of communism, military obsession, supersized food, flags everywhere, no unions, people relying on tips etc
Feels like it's stuck in time
You get 3 days off paid plus 2 optional unpaid for:
- your wedding
- the birth of your child
- the death of close kin
No paid leave for moving
Do you
do you actually think that only Scandinavians have to deal with that
Yeah I heard this is a huge problem with Scandinavia
About paragrafryttare, I think it suits more Swiss and Germans
People who go abroad are generally much friendlier, maybe because those who travel tend to be more open minded
Or because they try to make some friends themselves
I thought it would be easy to be friends with Japanese and Koreans because I had some friends from there in college, but once you actually go to East Asia, it’s nearly impossible
Bruh I’m sure that going from south to north, there’s some territory in Scandinavia where it sucks the most ass because it’s already really dark but there is still no good Scandinavian winter aesthetics lol
I’ve had this problem in other countries as well
Minimum wage workers in Coffee shops speak perfect English, but high paid doctors and bankers don’t speak any
People might be exaggerating problems with Swedish politics but it doesn’t mean that there are no problems
And there sure are some fucking problems
Yeah same, it’s the kind of people who just can’t stand those who don’t always act as it written word by word in the law
brrrr
Brazilians are up there with Mexicans and Colombians for sure
Also I find that even genuine connection is harder to get in places like that
Sure the superficial chit chat in Southern Europe and Latin America may seem shallow, but it can evolve into genuine friendships
I’ve kept in touch with people I met randomly outside
In Russian there is a word, that is borrowed directly from English: "суперстар" that means exactly that "a superstar", but there is a Russian word "стар", that looks like English "star", nut means "old".
So one can say "Я стар, я просто суперстар", that will mean "I am old, I am just a superstar".
Meanwhile in Russia there more news about what is happening in Ukraine(but now there's more about Belarus) than news about what is happening in Russia
Yes, Russian TV-news mostly about other countries than about Russia itself
It's like "If you don't speak about problems, they don't exist".
The Netherlands probably
Germany
It’s the best country to live for me
Iceland
Beautiful
Switzerland
The place is so pretty
It's better than an authoritarian government, homophobia and commieblocks
Ill wait for citizens of St Petersburg
We just left an Orlando airport on a rented car
There was a black woman at the pay toll
When she heard us speaking unknown for her language she asked : "what language are you speaking
". I said "Russian". Her next question really shocked me: " soooo, you're from Germany,  right
". Come on, don't you know the results of WWII
P.S. it's off topic to be honest, but just wanted to share
Typical "FrEnglish" burns my ears but, since I can't speak French, I feel like I don't have the right to complain
Probably said you're strong because Bjork and The Mountain from GoT are the only Icelanders anyone knows, lol
To offer a counter-argument; it is pretty annoying to be subjected to a language you can't understand in a public chat
If you wanted to speak to your brother directly, you could've just used Discord or something, no
Why should the whole lobby have to hear you talking, especially if they can't understand
As a (white) immigrant to Russia, the difference in treatment I receive from the churkas is pretty guilt-inducing
I've been bitched about a few times, but I'm sure it's much worse if you've a dark complexion
Man don’t throw the ч-word around that casually
Really
Russians seem to throw it around willy-nilly
You're free to remind them it's a trashy thing to do
Fair, it's a bit hard to get a gauge on things since A. Judging the weight of foreign profanity is pretty difficult and B. Russians don't really seem to buy into the concept of racism (as it is back home at least)
But I'll refrain from using the word
Russians are blunt in general, there’s no political correctness culture here
Russia is home to like 100+ ethnic groups
The concept of racism here, in my opinion, gets more along the lines of ethnic nationalism and religious prejudice rather than racial superiority theories
A fair bit is also playful banter
A fair bit is malicious and fueled by true and perceived historical grievances
I think as a Brit you can relate
You guys went around putting your flag on things, we did the same and never lost most of the “colonies” as they are firmly attached to the core Russian landmass
In the recent years due to erosion of economic stability (however fleeting it was, the period of 2000-2014 was a period of growth and newfound optimism as opposed to current stagnation and degradation of social contract between the “elite” and the people) and the increase of migration from neighboring Central Asian counties (Russia is like number 3 after USA and Germany in number of immigrants received) gives rise to social tensions
*In the recent years
* 2000-2014 was definitely not a better time for ethnic tensions
In fact around the years 2014-2017 we were at some of the lowest levels of xenophobia in decades according to polls
>Выросла (с 10 до 19%) и доля граждан, одобряющих идею «Россия для русских», которая снижалась с 2014
39% опрошенных лояльно относятся к дискриминационным объявлениям о сдаче жилья или о работе (больше всего таких ответов в Москве – 63%)
Кроме того, с 58 до 67% выросла доля респондентов, считающих, что правительство должно ограничивать приток мигрантов.
>Разные объекты неприятия актуализируются в общественном мнении в зависимости от социально-политического контекста, поясняет Пипия: «Неприязнь к другим гражданам и шире – к государствам на фоне чемпионата мира по футболу демонстрировала позитивную динамику, чему косвенное свидетельство – заметное улучшение отношения к США и ЕС летом 2018 г. **Эта внешняя ксенофобия в 2014–2017 гг. вытеснила этническую ксенофобию, распространенную до 2014 г. Теперь же на место негативного отношения к Западу возвращается базовая ксенофобия к этническим меньшинствам**».
Basically we were more tolerant towards ethnic minorities when we felt more antagonism towards the West ironically enough
Sorry for phrasing, I meant 2000-2014 as better years for economy / perception of economy
I’ve never supplied statistics for ethnic tensions
I agree with your sources, I remember there was a lot of neo-nazis in late 1990ies - early 2000is, right now they’re virtually non-existent
There’s casual racism in the western sense though as far as colloquial expressions go and that was the primary topic of the original discussion that flourished from my original throwaway joke
It’s really hard to quantify “casual” stuff, such as private discussions using ethnic slurs
The way I see it, it’s pretty common and this sentiment is shared by the British dude I was talking to
Today I learned that the common card deck is called french and that there are others
Depends on season
In summer 15°C is pretty cold
In Winter -25°C. In Fall and Spring nobody really understands what is cold, what is fresh, what is hot so it's easy to meet someone wearing a down jacket, and next to someone wearing a T-shirt, and you find it difficult to say which of them was wrong with the choice of clothes
I'll wear a light jacket if it's below 18C. Or maybe a light cotton sweater
I'll switch to a medium jacket when it's below 10C or put on a sweater under my light jacket
I'll switch to my down jacket when it's below -10C or maybe when it's below -2C and I have to spend a lot of time outside doing nothing strenuous
When it's below -18C I'll start complaining about the weather
Same for me
Germany
London
Switzerland
Don’t ask me why, I can’t elaborate it properly
Maybe because Europe associates with these countries for me
Just fine
Personally, I just get sad or annoyed that it's dark so early, but nothing major
Also snow helps: it reflects light and thus keeps the ground from being completely black
I don't think your reaction to winter is normal, you should go to a professional if it interferes with your daily life
Although he doesn't compensate this probably with increased alcohol consumption
Yeah, I didn't realize how much of a difference it makes until this winter, we usually have at least *some* snow by the end of December
It isn't a popular phrase in Russian and, as such, it doesn't have a conventional meaning
Depending on the context, it could mean being brave or being "a real man".
Because it doesn't have a sea (that would be my reason)
You should buy a lot of real estate and you will get a passive income
Then you will be able to retire and relax in Switzerland
I don't need a private jet, I want to live by the sea
Yes, quite a few times
Situations when all choices are just really bad are pretty rare
I never miss any elections (or "elections"), and I can't say I've ever been ashamed of my own vote
I've also supported and continue to support politicians with money and the nomination procedure
That's quite true
To many Russians Putin was the person to restore the faith in the Country
He represents what Russia always wanted to be: strong, healthy and independent
Russia was never given the chance to join the UN but America was
While the Cold war officially ended it's quite estranging to Russians to know that your former biggest enemy is sitting with missiles as close to you border as they can
Putin has this strong, unapologetic image which Russia needed as they felt that any sign of kindness they showed the world wasn't reciprocated
While I don't agree with this I can understand the reasoning
Yes, Putin's support increases with age
However, he managed to piss off his core electorate quite a bit recently by increasing the pension age
Putin's votes have always been mostly legit
That's the power of an autocrat
It's changing though
Obviously yes
Russia doesn't have fair elections, but you can still operate and even sometimes win within the limitations of unfair ones
The government also needs at least an illusion of democracy to maintain legitimacy, so they can't just abolish all democratic procedures completely
We are not in North Korea
> Russia was never given the chance to join the UN
Do you mean something else
USSR was a founding member of the UN and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and Russia inherited said position, which makes Russia one of the most influential UN members
I'm sorry I meant the Nato
My mistake
Yes, the same type of no-alternative elections we had during the Soviet times
When there was only one candidate on the ballot, and if you wanted to vote "no", you had to physically go into a cabin and cross away the name, thus making it public that you're voting "no" which endangered your wellbing
Thankfully, we have secret ballots nowadays
Voting for anyone is safe
It’s pretty common
I think it’s perceived as a bad habit
Started because i wanted to show off when i was young, now can’t get rid of this shit
My mother quit at the age of 47 and hasn't looked back for 2 years already
That wasn't easy for her, and she had tried quitting before that, but every new attempt would have been easier for her and lasted longer
She says an online community of aspiring quitters helped her a great deal, and she still posts there sometimes to inspire other people
25$ for a cigarettes pack !!!
I understand that it’s not so common in Australia since cigarettes cost 25$ lol
Also very popular in Russia
I really find it weird and not everyone likes it
Idk, [our Wikipedia] says 27
3% (but another part of that article says it's 39
1%?) of population smoked in 2019, and it's believable
It's much higher among men, yes, but it's going down
I paid something like 25-27 $ for a brand in Sydney in 2018, as far as I remember
That US played a major role in defeating Third Reich or "won" the Second World War
Yeah, unfortunately I even had to lecture my mum on that Romanians have latin/roman origin and not gypsy
I agree, these kinds of debates rarely make any sense anyway
Unlimited POWER
Definitely less than 10% here
That would be asking for harassment in Russia
I guess they mostly do so on nude beaches or somewhere where they aren't exposed to the public, like their own backyard in a summer house or some secluded lake where no one goes
Maybe 5% on Russian "wild" beaches in the south where you must forge your own way to though a rocky path
Most of the people sadly prefer to stay on crowded beaches - and there will be 95% of those
According to statistics 84
6% of people tend to believe to non-integral numbers
It can be from 1/3 of an average month pay to 3 times more expensive
So, having a Lego is kinda luxury
Lego's price like skyrocketed past 10 year
I remember we go after school to Lego shop and maybe bye something in was about 2-5$ in today's exchange
Now it's fucking from 15$ up up to heavens
Do you know the real reason to this
It is
I personally own zero lego products
When a child, my husband had about 4 big set and he was considered the richest guy around
Exactly
That’s a good way to sum it up
If something’s on google it’s not private
>Early Modern English:
Old-fashioned
I don't get all the words, but it does look and sound like English
>Middle English:
Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, and then I don't really get anything, but it still looks like English more or less
> Old English:
I won't even try to read this
>And for fun we'll throw in the sister language for English, Scots:
Feels like Ukrainian tbh: sometimes you can understand everything, but then it goes god knows where and you understand nothing
Middle English is quite understandable if you read phonetically
Early Modern is even little harder
Old English — cannot understand a single word
More like Serbian or Polish
I can get some words in Serbian and Polish, but it's very hard to understand general meaning
Wow, there is **the** meme
"Letz mi spik from mai hart" By Vitaly Mutko, Russian minister of Sport back then
You must listen to this perfect joy: [
Though the English is good because he was reading it, pronunciation is the key to the video
Clearly he was reading transcriptions written down in Cyrillic's.
Later on Putin, who is well known for creative birthday gifting, gifted him English phrasebook/self-help guide: [
That's... you know, he really did the best he could
When I was in Helsinki, I met an old lady in a grocery store in Itakeskus
She tried to talk to me, but once she realized that I don’t understand a thing in Finnish she switched to English with damn ease
I was impressed and we had a good experience talking to each other
This parliament is so fun
Very distinct from other countries
>This was her speech defending the candidature for the Olympic games in 2013
That's like a tradition
Yours is third of a kind connected to Olympics, in this thread
It's not even an accent
I think that he just reads cyrillcs transcription not even understanding what is he sayn, so it just pure Russian sound without even a hint on "pronunciation" thingy
Yes, the full title was "Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of Russian Federation", that title is shown on 0:09 He also was Russia bid manager to 2018 worldcup
Do you have like a specific timeframe as this could take a while
Too many to name tbh, but I'd say collectivization and the Holodomor
Russification policies that were widespread during Tsarist rule
Ivan the Terrible, the leader responsible for the beautiful palace in Moscow
But when it was finished he tore out the eyes of the architects who built it so "they could never build something so beautiful again" nice guy :)
There's also the time that Alexander the Great destroyed the city of Thebes and sold all of it's inhabitants into slavery to be able to fund his army
Anakin Skywalkerowicz
Although verb conjugation in Russian might be considered a war crime, I think there are things more horrible than making people speak and behave as Russians
I'd say the Swedish Potop of Poland in the 17th century can be up there too
I mean
Karl XII of Sweden was competent too and he failed miserably in the end
I don't have an opinion on whether Macedonia is part of Greece because it's like asking whether Kaliningrad is German or not: Both sides have decent arguments on different grounds
Historical claims vs right of conquest
But Alexander spoke Greek; worshipped Greek Gods; took on the cause of freeing Greek cities from Persian rule; was educated by one of the most famous Greek philosophers in history; his family competed in the Olympics etc
The man himself was a Greek
There is no possibility of his being anything else
Well, you see, people used to have a holiday on 7th of November (Revolution Day) and would be pissed to get it cancelled, but it was kinda awkward to continue to celebrate 7th of November after 1991
So bureaucrats searched through our very long and eventful history and found 4th of November when Moscow was liberated from Poles in 17th century, slapped "Day of National Unity" label on it and called it a day, heh
It's basically a placeholder of that holiday which was lost on Revolution Day, people mostly don't even remember what this new holiday is supposed to be
There's literally only six countries on this planet that British soldiers haven't visited at some point
Look it up
We have a long memory, and a lot of our abuses of our neighbors are justified by the nationalists as self-defense
Not quite, it was more a church holiday, Day of icon of Our Lady of Kazan, on which also liberation of Moscow was remembered and celebrated
Btw, for Romanovs it was somewhat family-related holiday since the dynasty was chosen to rule as a result of Time of Troubles
There was also an episode when Poles were going to kill young Romanov (and make son of Polish king rule Russia) and peasant Ivan Susanin sacrificed himself to prevent it - he pretended to lead them to Mikhail Romanov but instead led them into a deep forest and they all were not seen again
Susanin was a national hero in Empire's times
But modern people don't think about it all, it's just one random day you can not to go to work
[The Amritsar Massacre]
A British colonel shoots up a demonstration in India killing more than a thousand people and injuring one thousand five hundred more
I understand that there are incidents in which we killed more people, but this one sticks with me more for the mental image
[Here it is in the film Gandhi
It isn’t same
Jumahat, jumasol
Ivan Kupala and Maslenitsa, both are very old, pre-christian holidays that is pagan
A Dutchperson that can't ride a bicycle, a Finn that hates sauna, an Italian that doesn't drink coffee
Who from your country can join them
A Russian who doesn't go through a pack of cigarettes every day
Which type of coffee is most used in Finland
Do Finns prefer cappucchino, americano, french-pressed or smth else
Oh, come on
We are no match for the Balkans in this regard
We're still the number 10 of the most smoking countries as of 2016
I was surprised to know, though
These rules might be necessary to know even if you don't ride a bike
There's a stereotype that you have a bike over pedestrian priority over there
The sun is солнце, neutral
The moon is месяц, masculine or луна, feminine
In Russian, the moon (luna) is feminine, the sun (solntse) is neutral gender
Nope
We call other moons satelite or moon (спутник/луна), but месяц is a word for a month and archaic name of the Moon, currently may be used to emphasize there is not full moon in the sky: полумесяц (crescent)
It's used for phases of the moon, it's a direct equivalent to the English "crescent moon". Planetary moons are usually just called "луны" in casual speech but in scientific style the more defined "спутники" (natural satellites) is used
No, only for our moon
However, луна can be used for any moon
Everyone can name more Italian Renaissance artists, than American presidents
Outside of the US, that is
I love visiting less-touristy areas for these reasons
Also one of the best reasons to travel is to meet people as well
In less touristy areas you will probably meet more authentic locals
What funny cases can you tell that was in your city
For example, in my city, we have the [round monument] Once there was a storm and this monument rolled through the city and [workers tried to catch it with bulldozers]
They want to spend time with their spouses working in retail, very logical
He took a PS4 from electronics aisle, went to fruit section, weighted the box and slapped the barcode for a fruit of that weight
Went to self-checkout and pinged the PS4 as about 10$ worth of fruit, nobody stopped him
I would say it is German but anybody who I met in Germany was fluent in English
So I would say Russian because in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus(144
5 + 42 + 9
5 = 196M people) nobody speaks English, only native language and Russian
Also, in Eastern Europe, if somebody doesn't speak English you have a good chance that he speaks Russian(possible it is the older generation)
Russian of course wouldn't be a good choice as the only foreign language for you but it is a good choice as the second foreign language after English
That Ukraine, Italy and France are considered large in Europe
Sorry if this sounds too Russia-centric but I was really surprised when I learned that
>having a plate drying rack in a cabinet above the kitchen sink is not universal, and I learnt this from a Finnish user, who stated in a comment that it's a thing in Finland and Italy
Also in Russia and i assume in Belarus and Ukraine
If we exclude Denmark with its Greenland, the largest European country is France, which is the 42nd country in the world by land area
So there are plenty of countries that are bigger than the European ones
Lol, when someone not from Russia asks where I'm from, I say that it's a medium-sized city near Moscow (150km)
Lmao
Though it's comparable to London, Paris and Istanbul
I'm obviously talking about land area
And Ukraine isn't considered large by most of the metrics you've mentioned
Or by claiming your rightful living space
I'm not sure it means the same thing for everyone, but for me it's 200 000 – 1 000 000
My town is about 350 000, so it's kinda smallish and definitely feels very provincial
50000 would be a very small town where everyone gets around on foot and knows each other
I mean the entire urban area, not just the city proper
It makes more sense to compare those
Good idea, that way you can claim land corridor to it next and grab Poland
And then
you know the drill
This is true, these are the only genuinely big cities in Russia
Hard to say, almost every historically important person has supporters now
Maybe Gorbachev is the closest one to the nomination
A difficult question
Nowadays it's probably Putin
No one immediately comes to mind except Andrey Vlasov
Siding with a regime that considers you, and the rest of your ethnicity subhumans to be exterminated - until it becomes obvious you're gonna lose - does that to you, I guess
I'll have to think about it
Politicians aren't universally hated
Stalin's seen as a great statesman by many; Nicholas II is seen as a well-intentioned man who just wasn't right for the job; Gorbachev is seen as a weakling etc -- but none of them are "*hated*."
u/marabou71 raised a good point
Andrey Chikatilo (Russia's most notorious serial killer-cum-necrophiliac) is probably a better answer
>Ceausescu
Honestly, I know how to pronounce that only because I know his name in Russian
Ironically enough, wasn't spreading the Pope's brand of Catholicism one of the reasons William the Conquerer's invasion of England was deemed legal
There’s “betraying your country to stay alive” shitty, and then there’s “putting your country up on Craigslist” shitty
More or less than the Targowica Confederation
I wonder if average Pole even remebers him
While he was Pole and began political career  in Wilno, there was little interaction between him and Poland during his prime years
Yeltsin
People tend to think that he is the reason why the Soviet Union lost the Cold War
That's pretty good
If even a tenth of the stuff he was accused of is true (like the abducting of girls and all), then he'd be hated massively
But yeah, the average Russian wouldn't know him I don't think
He's not really hated though
He's the sort of person you just roll your eyes and sign at
Who, Geralt
Probably used silver sword
Very accurate
Both Beria and Ezhov are kinda known but kinda forgotten at the same time
Depends on erudition of a person
But those who know associate them with bad things only
There is still a bad ring to "Beria" name, compared to that of "SS" one
I mean, it even sounds scary and evil
Taking a leap from state figures, Chikatilo probably would be nominated for most disgusting person award by most people
Shame, that cunt should be hated
Has done irreversible damage to us
The fall of the USSR was tragic
People don’t hate him for losing the cold war, they hate him for the repercussions
The hunger, unemployment, chaos
Nobody wants fascism in this country
We still have WWII heroes walking our streets and Russians remember the horrors of Nazi Germany
I think he's one of the reasons the USSR not just fell, but shattered into pieces
I thought he only started it
Tbh it’s kind weird
Catherine the Great is considered one of the greatest rulers of the Russian Empire, among Peter I.
She did have some very wild sex tho
Also a good contender
Yeah, I think I'm gonna edit my answer to include Chikatilo
Maybe his hatred is so great that it alone puts Kaczynski on top
I think historians could argue on the motives here,  in the end history cannot be written objectively
And you’re absolutely right
The neo-fascist ideology is rising even in countries that suffered from it in the past like Germany and Italy

Thanks America for the land-lease, of course we could have taken Berlin without any technical support but only God knows how much more Russian blood would have been spilled
Also thanks Finland and Austria for maintaining their neutrality
This is more important to us than you think
>Thank you to all countries who stood up to Germany and Russia over the last 1000 years
Russia was created less than 600 years ago, Germany -- 200 years ago
Hm, I've always thought that Alexander II is the most popular Russian monarch in Finland, not Alexander I...
>his russification campaign
It was his father, Alexander III, who started it, so I bet that AIII wasn't popular, either
Okay
Thank you very much for the information
It was very interesting to learn how the rulers were seen and are rememberes in regions of the Empire, apart from the "core" Russian provinces
I'm rooting for you guys
When I was in Georgia last time I was pleasantly surprised that most young people I met spoke little to no Russian, but instead they all spoke perfect English, so that's how we communicated
It all starts with the youth who are raised to cherish their native language and culture, with the help of the government, of course
I meant that priorities are changing, especially with the youth
I'm not saying that it's bad to learn and speak Russian or any other language
But, somehow (I might be wrong) I feel like the compulsory learning of Russian at schools is a thing of the past and abandoning this practice is a step forward for some of the ex-Soviet republics in building a strong national identity
But, of course, what works for some countries like Georgia or Estonia, might not necessarily work for, perhaps, more linguistically diverse countries like Belarus or Ukraine
These are just some personal thoughts, coming from a linguist who roots for linguistic diversity in the world))
Look, I was just trying to point out that compulsory learning of Russian seems to be the reason why some national and regional languages receive less attention, especially among the youth, which doesn't make it easier for the promotion of a language
Secondly, I never said that Georgia and Estonia have NO linguistic diversity
Obviously, Georgia has other languages apart from Georgian
But it is more monolingual than, say, Ukraine, because 87% of population there speaks Georgian, compare that to 67% of Ukrainian speaking population
At the same time, I agree that adding Estonia to the list is a bit of a stretch
Every day
It’s really too much and sometimes it’s annoying because I want to know more news about my country
I want to see the protests in Russia on TV more than in the USA(They show it to us every day)
We have a lot of misinformation about the United States on television
Seems like there are already too many comments there
But I will add: rarely lol
I only hear of USA in context of major events, it surely will be on news during American elections, or during important international meeting
But the USA don't appear as often here
Most of my news are about Belarus right now
But why everyone goes there to do a stag party
I know 1-2 persons who did it already
LMAO, please tell me that’s it’s a reference to Skripal case
Yeah exactly
It's not an authentic Medieval castle, but it's still really cool
And of course paints a picture of what people in the 19th century romanticized the Medieval times as
Excellent ahahaha
Originally Poland, then Turkey (starting from the 18th century), then the UK (19th century) and starting from the 20th century the USA
But it's all politics
I personally like all those countries
Well, I wouldn't say so, really
It is tantamount to saying that the rival of the US Vietnam or Iraq instead of China
Rivals are countries that are kind of equally powerful
Ukraine isn't a rival
It is part of the motherland
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Я рад, что тебе понравилось ;)
You called
Good times
Well, economy is not the only factor that defines Great powers
Actually, the concept of great powers is very relative
Many consider Britain, France, India, Japan great powers
Even Brazil sometimes
I don't quite agree with you
Well, China is not a superpower, either
I didn't say that Russia has faster GDP growth than China
This is a windmill
I agree that China is much stronger than Russia
But at the same time I say that Russia is definitely not a secondary power
I think that disagreeing with it is simply strange
Well, here everything just relies on your definition
I, for example, see Russia as a great power and countries like Poland or Italy as regional powers
It is all abstract constructions that are not connected to reality anyways
I didn't say that the US is currently a rival of Russia
I said that it was in the 20th century
Today the greatest rival of Russia is Russia
I didn't try to change my version
Maybe I indeed didn't express myself clearly and I admit that
But I won't tolerate slander from your behalf
I started arguing with your statement saying that Russia is not the great power
Then we discussed China and finally concluded that views on statuses of great powers, regional powers and superpowers are relative
I truly didn't comment that thing about 70s because I got distracted by the other argument in that comment
What you are doing now is pedantic nitpicking
Why are you so aggressive, anyways
It feels like you were wasting people's time, fighting your imagination
What makes you think that the question is about today
Is it mentioned that the rival must contemporary
Why do you assume that a rival is something contemporary at all
There are a lot of answers under this post that are about history
Why don't you tell them all that they are vasting someone's time
P.S. your imagination
Giving stats comparing china and russia (nobody asked you about it) and complaining that I dare to change my own words in order to take your laurel from your great reddit debate victory over my statements that you had misinterpreted
>The most popular activity seems visiting giant malls built on slave labor
No thanks
You are saying this as if you visit  giant malls built by slaves every day
Where else can you find such mixure of modernity and  antiquity
I was in Munich 10 years ago around Christmas time and I remember than the men putting up the Christmas tree were wearing Wehrmacht helmets painted yellow-green
CZ/RU:
čerstvý/cherstvyj - fresh/stale
vůně/vonj - smell/stench
záchod/zakhod (solntsa) - toilet/sunset
pozor/pozor - attention/shame
Чёрствый (Ćorstvyj) is mostly used to describe stale, hardened bread or baked goods
Rotten would be гнилой (gniloj)
Its not so bad here
The climate is frustrating sometimes
My country is all over the place
That's cool, i guess, and with nukes we don't even have to bother about invasions from all sides
It would be great to have access to Mediterranean, to its trade, culture and climate, but i guess Black sea will suffice
Surely Portugal's the most ideally placed country in Europe for exploration
It has/had straight routes both down to Africa and the Cape of Good Hope and westward to Brazil and the Americas
A coloniser/trading nation couldn't ask for a better location
As for Britain, it's a similar story; perfectly situated for maritime escapades
Once the Isles were unified and England no longer shared any land borders with other powers, the protection afforded by the English Channel and the North Sea meant that Britain never had to spend as great a proportion of its wealth on its armies as continental Europeans were forced to
That meant more money was available for the navy and, ultimately, the British could outspend any naval rival until the 20th century
Perhaps the next most happy coincidence was the plentiful reserves of easily accessible coal, which allowed the UK to independently fuel its industrial revolution
You could argue that these two geographical facts made it pretty much a certainty that Britain would be a great power until oil supplanted coal as the primary fuel of ships
>We have great neighbours, allowing us to borrow (quite) a bit of their culture, mainly gastronomical
Orrite mate, you won' try these 'ere fish 'n' chips
I really like Romania, so I hope our government doesn't try to pull any nonsense down there
You guys have a very good relationship with Serbia though, and I don't think Russia would want to fight with Serbia's other BFF
Yeah, humour aside, the Irish should be at the top of our apology list
You can realise Ekaterina's dream to "liberate" Constantinople
But it's all they talk about in heaven, no
But then you look on the other side of the couch past Bulgaria and suddenly neither place seems so good lol
I also think the History of England has to be viewed as two separate narratives/experiences in which the ruling class is separate from the commoners
How the Plantaganets saw themselves was obviously different from the Old English peasantry and I'd argue that the monarchy wasn't really properly divorced from Europe until Queen Victoria and the loss of Hanover
Until that point there was always *some* interest tying monarchs to the continent (claims on France, outposts like Calais, aspirations to meddle, foreign offices, etc
>we haven't been successfully invaded
[Oj rili
I'll admit I'm being a tad facetious
It's interesting how it seems that, with the Stuarts, England managed to *twice* make a foreign ruler place the interests of his new throne ahead of that of his other country
Still, though, William did land a fleet and an army on English soil
Well there was a bit of a scuffle in Reading and the Irish obviously had words to say later ;)
Life is too short to spend your whole life in one country without seeing how other people live
Напоминает анекдот про неуловимого джо
Yeah traveling it’s probably the only thing where you spend money but become richer
Отложить личину [otlojit' lechinu]- literal translation would be "to deposit a maggot". Trust me, it sounds better in Russian
We joke that Caucasians love tuned Ladas
"The higher the mountains, the lower the Prioras
" The stereotypical car there is a white Lada Priora (because it's the cheapest color) with 100% tint on every window and suspension tuned so low you can hear every grain of sand grind on its belly
It makes sense
"Lada" is derived from *lad'ya* (a type of Slavic boat; Lada uses it as a brand label), so the Polish for boat, łódź, is etymologically related to it
But they still have the highest market share
No, Bronto is a special edition
They sold the name Niva to Chevrolet and renamed the original car 4x4
Now Chevy has pulled out of the Russian market and AutoVAZ owns the name again
When I lived in the UK with my girlfriend I went to dinner with her parents for her birthday, and I didn't make a very good impression
I've always been used to doing things a certain way in Russia
So when I came through the door, I waited for them to invite me further in so I just stood there like an idiot for a couple of minutes before thinking better of it
Then I took my shoes off (which none of them did) and ended up having to put them back on
That dinner was a disaster
They apparently found me very hard to talk to; I offended the mother by suggesting something for one of her dishes; they found my habits strange etc
I expected it to be an answer about the other kind of trash
Most cars in Moscow/SPB will stop, because cameras are everywhere and they don't fancy going to jail and/or losing their license over hitting some moron
Russian law: if a pedestrian is crossing in an improper spot, they are in the wrong
If you hit them, you are in the wrong
Is it some very European joke or what
Why you can't have a dinner at 19 or 21:30
Why
It was partially my fault as well
I should have asked what to do before I turned up
Luckily enough I got rather close with her parents in time
People do it all the time with me :(
Not like that
Because it makes no sense
The damn day has 24 hours, not 12
I was traveling with a group of east Asian people
My stomach was upset and I wanted something bland and quick to eat, so I kept asking to stop for bread
They were very confused and eventually started laughing
I couldn't understand what was so funny about wanting to have a piece of bread, until someone explained that white bread is not seen as an "upset stomach" type of food in Asia
Rather, it's viewed as a dessert
Yes, this measure could be different for different parts of Russia too
Once I've been to Yaroslavl and had trouble with roaming and the manager in a store said that it is easier for me to go to Kostroma and buy sim-cart there
It was some kind of confusion for me because I’m used to taking a trip to a neighboring city as a serious business that takes a whole day to get there and a day back
And then she said \`You will back in the evening\`.
Oh, these small West-Russia distances
It's hard for me to even imagine how people live in western Europe, where distances are even less
I live in Siberia
Each place that you can reach during daylight hours is near
Yeah breads tend to be sweeter and much softer
Many European people who come to Japan/Korea are often very disappointed by the quality of bread compared to their home countries
&#x200B;
For scale:
Why swing the dial all the way to commieblocks
Rowhouses are a nice medium density alternative
Yes
we also perceive all the distances that you can cover in the daytime as close
The thing that I noticed, is that people really feel that they are so [insert nation] only when they leave their home country and start living abroad
The grass seems always greener on the other side ...
I always felt Russian (even if I have some Armenian background)
I love our country, our history (yeah, not all parts of our history) and our mentality
Since i am a reserved person, maybe “shy”, I just noticed that I can’t fit well in countries like Spain, France, Italy
since people there are much more talkative, love partying 24/7, loud etc
So i guess i will never feel better than home, just because of the Russian mentality, even if we have a fucking long way to go to meet European quality life standards
Sry for my english
Russian Estonian or Estonian Estonian
T’as pas vu le film Budapest avec Manu Payet toi par hasard
I've never seen anything like that, lmao
You can see a random graffiti here and there (almost never related to religion, though), but I guess that doesn't really count
Ukrainian and Belorussian
I cannot choose between them  because they both are easy for a Russian to read (and listen, too, actually)
Probably Belorussian is a bit easier, though I haven't heard or seen it as often as Ukrainian because in Belarus most people use Russian, anyway
I also understand it much easier than Czech when spoken for some reason
For be Belarusian is definitely much easier to follow
The same for me about polish
just a sandwich man
Hi all
In Russia we have Teremok  They cook Bliny (thin pancakes) with different stuflings
We have pirožki, which are hand pies with various fillings:
- cabbage
- apple
- sour cherry
- minced meat
- egg and onion
- mashed potato
- rice and egg
Probably shaurma
( Not really russian, but extremely popular here)
Irony
The main inscription on the website says "Teremok isn't fastfood"
Not really
Its certainly not national
But we all know, that isn't true
But I like it
Sometimes I'm glad to order a glass of kvass :)
By the way, how can I get the Russian flag into my nickname here
>Home Page of the sub
>3 dots in the right corner
>change user flair
Спасибо :)
Но проблем)
I guess that it is considered strange
It is extremely uncommon
Not really, they're sold at most events hosted by local governments
I've only really seen it on government buildings
Very possible
However, I don't think that there are a lot of flag nerds
Well, yeah, it goes without saying
But people don't display them on their houses or something
Well, of course people who are very patriotic buy and wear clothes with the Russian flag on it, but when I wrote my comment I was thinking rather about having flags on walls of houses, outside or inside
Or, you know, like in American suburbs where they place flagpoles with American flags near the house door
We don't usually do that here
Fans of the USSR certainly do
Some of them say that it is a "real" Russian flag and all
Some go even further and bring up the [black-yellow-white flag] of the Empire and say that it is a real flag (though it was used only for 38 years and the rest of the time the Empire, which existed for 300 years used the modern-day white-sea-red one)
So yeah, people still don't know which flag they want
Hm, having taken a second thought, I change my mind, hahah
I think that it is excessive to connect nationalism and flag worshiping
The name speaks for itself
[Banner over the Reichstag]
Oh yeah
I couldn’t think of a famous photo from Russia’s until I saw this
The first 9 pics are quite famous, but why Nixon
Dog's poos
The vast majority of dog owners don't clean after their pets
And since population density is really high in Moscow, people love doggies and there are zero restrictions, it leads to the ground covered in faeces
810 roubles (about 9 euros) per month and I receive unlimited Internet for two mobile devices (with free hotspot availability — this is considered a separate service, but is included in this particular tariff), 1300 minutes per month and 300 SMS per month to share between them and a few other temporary perks
Yeah, some things related to computers and phones are really cheaper in Russia, but quality is often sacrificed for price
And still your life expectancy is pretty good, I wonder if it’s due to ecology and food quality
Wow, that is super bad even for poor regions in Russia
5 years
That is insane
Is it due to overload of your medical system or is mental health not taken seriously
Sorry to hear that, mental health should definitely be a priority anywhere in the world
Hope you feel better soon
The only one i can think of that is still in use is sotka (from the word sotnyj - 100th), it's used when measuring land and is equal to 100 m^(2) (it's pretty much just a different name for are)
Traditional units of measurement were replaced by metric ones after the revolution, but you can stumble upon them in our classical literature
Some of them: versta = 1
067 km, pud = 16
38 kg, arshin = 71 cm, vershok = 4
5 cm
I used to hate the food that Russians always eat on major celebrations like New Year's Eve and others, but now I tremendously enjoy it
Behold:
* [dressed herring]
* [aspic]
* [beetroot salad] edit: it's almost always coated in mayonnaise or sour cream, but google images seem to be unaware of it for some reason
* [pickled cucumbers]
* [pork fat]
There’s something so special about Ukrainian folk music that just sets it apart from anything else
One of the only genres that you genuinely want to sing along to
Aspic tastes much better than it appears
But you'll never know that until you become brave enough to try it
That looks very similar to what we serve here since it's usually dressed with mayonnaise or sour cream
For some reason, google pics that I linked tend to show the version without sauce
Not only does it look gross, but its Russian name doesn't sound appetising at all
Both "холодец" and the even worse "студень" suggest that it's something slimy and nauseous (just from the sound, not from the actual underlying meanings of these words)
I guess it contains some nutrients that are good for your joints
At least my grandmother always says that
Probably it is, but English isn't my native language, so I may not always say things like a native speaker would
The direct translation from Russian would be "salted cucumbers", "marinated cucumbers" or "preserved cucumbers". I guess pickles is ambiguous since other vegetables like tomatoes can be pickled too
Russian Google says it's because originally it was made with a vinegar sauce that was called vinaigrette in French
And French was a popular language at that time
I did, thanks for recommending it to me
It’s stunning
Folk is is a genre that seems transport you to another place
Whatever mood I was in before playing it is completely transformed by the stunning vocals of Eastern European folk music
You'll appreciate it if you focus on the flavours, not the looks
The best way to try it is by taking part in a blind contest where you don't see what you're given
The taste is really good (although it's subjective)
I think what’s so great about folk is that it shows us a country’s soul and culture before mass cultural exchanges
As you said, the music feels pure, raw, primal
It was honest
It’s honest now, but personally, that level of intimacy is gone
I've never seen fish-based aspic tbh
I guess it's mostly with pork or sometimes chicken or beef, but hypothetically could be anything
Nordsee, since we don't have good seafood casual dining
McDonalds shrimps aren't bad, but aren't enough
Not really
In Russia we don't actually use even "e-mail" in casual conversation
We usually decrypt that abbreviation and say "electronic mail".
As for "g-mail'', in Russia the situation on a market is quite different
Here Google has two local competitors, Yandex and Mail
ru companies which somehow manage to stand against Google
They both have their own mails
Many people use theirs instead of Google's. Most use all three
Mail
ru is considered as something that boomers use, though
Sometimes
But Russia has a couple of alternative mail services that people use so we don't say gmail that much
Even I, who uses gmail, say e-mail still
In russia we say either electronic post (elektronnaja počta) or colloquially we call it soap (mylo) because it sounds a bit like “mail”
No, we haven't. We usually just say "mail" (почта), in more official speech it's usually specified that you talk about electronic mail (электронная почта)
Also, I'm not even sure if Google is the most popular email provider here, we also have Yandex and Mail
ru which seem to be as, if not more, popular
Boomers use rambler
I am too much of a zoomer to recall rambler, tbh
Poland, Lithuanua, Germany
I wanted to write Sweden and the Ottomans, but we don't learn much about their internal policies and foreign ambitions beyond wars with Russia
Make it 58
Only after you become a senior citizen you earn the priviledge to spend your retirement money on dem pistol banana skins
Gotta start early to spend all those euros
It's 65 for men, 60 for women here actually
It’s 65 for men these days
but if they do, they can gamble too
I don't know, maybe because it's considered that it's harder for them to work, maybe it's for them to stay home with grandkids, maybe something else
I read that when senior citizenship started in Europe, they used to get it earlier, because their lifespan was shorter, but now I don't know why
It will be Communism with the Global Ai and Atomic Robots
Don't be afraid, mate, you will not be alone :3
We have lots
For example:
Despite all the difficulties, Ukraine remains the fraternal country
I think every third Russian has relatives in Ukraine
Belarus
It used to be Ukraine, too, but after the unfortunate events in the recent past the countries are not longer friendly to each other
Ukraine
I guess
Yes, governments definitely aren't friendly to each other, but people still get along fine
But you can't deny that our countries grew from one tree - Old Rus
We're Eastern Slavs
I don't speak about politics but about people
There are a lot of Russians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia
Almost  in every region of Russia the second nation is Ukrainians
We have common history
Russians love Ukrainian literature, especially, Shevchenko
Please, don't make an artificial border between two nations
We should be friends not enemies
Да и клал я вообще на политику. Как будто прям все россияне поддерживают нынешнюю власть.
Love you too
Yes, you're right
But, actually, the relatives of majority of Russians are in Ukraine
Yes, I forgot about Belarus
Honestly, there are very minor differences between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus
My friend who came to Russia from Ukraine told me that he didn't see any differences at all ( except language, ofc)
I am generally satisfied with the current version of my country's flag (certainly better than the USSR's one)
Maybe I'd add Russian double-headed eagle on it, though
It is one of the symbols of the country and bears a good share of its historical legacy
Besides, almost any national facility has it as a part of its emblem, so why don't we put it onto the flag
That's optional, though
Like I said, I am generally satisfied with the current flag
Would probably add our emblem to our flag somehow : [link] and also make the blue color darker
My favourite one is [this]
Your flag is one of the best, imo
It would actually make more sense
Good idea
Not rent, but if you have a job you're expected to contribute to family expenses
Same as in Romania
but you're also expected to help your parents when they're old (we call it "to pass them a glass of water"), and sending your parents to a retirement home is a social taboo here
So basically your parents help you while you're young, and you help them when they're old
(Not OP) I've seen Americans on social media actually call it "rent" because that's what it is, but that may be different in Scotland/the UK
« Why are you always angry when you talk to your parents/friends »?
Nope, I am not angry, it’s just a normal conversation =\
It’s actually sounds very professional and intelligent, I find
The same is said about Russian
In my opinion, French, Italian and Spanish (aka the most beautiful and romantic languages in the world) sound a lot harsher than Russian or German
Never heard of "Psheki". We mostly say Polyaki
&#x200B;
Edit: if so, "Psheki" would be slightly derogatory
Polyaki - nyet
It was for danish or german
German for me sounds like russian speaking english with accent
No you say “allora” every sentence
Opera singing in German is magnificent and powerful
It’s probably linked to the general russian mindset -> don’t give a shit
danke !
Got you :)
French mainly for the nasals and the "r" sound (I know it's the same in German, but it's pronounced in a more relaxed manner in German), and Italian mainly for the intonation
I can understand for French, hardly for Spanish, but not really for italian
It’s soooooo soft
Lol, I am reading you and I am actually in Amsterdam airport waiting for my connection flight
Funny ;)
Spanish sounds a bit aggressive to me, even though it's not
Poland for such cities as Lvov and Grodno (even though they are not Russian, yet), Germany for beautiful Kaliningrad
Finland for Karelia where I was born
Sweden for Ingermanland where St
Petersburg was built
Thank you Serbia for being bros and not jumping on the Russophobia train
We also have to thank Iceland for the same
I doubt they are Russophobic
This small village doesn't care about politics at all, cool guys
Stalin, or should I say Soviet soldiers have freed most of the European continent
My grandad was fighting for Budapest and Prague
That's why it's so weird to see Polish people writing "thank you Germany for being a role model". Wow
Why would we ever save their asses
I understand that, I don’t like him either
But reading comments online, it does seem like there are certain users who hate not only the president, but the people themselves
Nazis forced almost every fifth Polish to death
Better dead than red
You supported Hitler and Holocaust :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
To be fairer a lot don’t
Wouldn’t phrase it with “agreeing”. Many Russian people simply don’t have a choice, both because Putin blocks opposition, and also because Russia still has some very derpy political parties that include Communist USSR offshoots and far right nutjobs
So Putin is seen by many as the lesser of the evils
For a good comparison, I would use Bolsonaro
Yes he is a huge twat, but I know that not all Brazilian people support him
And a lot who do, simply do so because the alternative isn’t much better
The alternative to Bolsonaro would likely be just as corrupt and greasy and slimey
In many countries sadly you can’t rise to the top of the political system without those traits
That's just fucked up
Polish hate Russians for occupying their eastern territories despite the fact they belong to Ukraine and Belarus
Supplying Cuba and other communists regimes was bad, but providing Iraq, Vietnam, Libiya with democracy is totaly ok
The USSR operation in Afghanistan (which was its neighbor btw) is an act of showing imperialistic force
Attack on Afghanistan by NATO is a prevention of world terrorism
But what outrage me the most is bombardment of Beograd
Wow
NATO are real peacemakers
Like what
Blow up the president/parliament only to create a power bubble to be filled by pretty much the same people
Vote in predetermined elections
It’s not that easy, you should know that
Well, just so you know, I AM working against the government
The situation here is much more hopeless than in Ukraine
Yeah, stopping would be very foolish
And good luck to you guys too
Hopefully you’ll get Crimea, Donbas, Donetsk back soon
Along with some huge financial reimbursements from us
When I was a kid we had a spring latch on our front door, and it was a constant source of problems, because you would often lock yourself out and when you left the apartment you would still use the key to engage the deadbolt for more security
On our current door we have a spring latch attached to the handle, so it just keeps the door closed, plus two deadbolts
One is engaged by a key from the outside and by a knob from the outside, so locking the door is easy
And yes, the door is kept locked at all times

I mean abortions are legal in Belarus, and it it's a much less religious country than Poland
edit: I don't mean to be spiteful to those Polish women who now will have to go to Germany etc
to get abortions since it's not their fault
I just wanted to make a comment about Poland becoming "more like Belarus".
In my humble opinion, Slovenia is quite uninteresting
No offence dear Slovenians
I may just not know much about your country
It's like Russia, that froze in 80s. Like time capsule
"Bald and bankrupt" did a lot of interesting traveling video's there, but he is really into USSR history/style
Cuz it is
Yeah, "good for you" is the first one that comes to mind
If you translate it to Russian word for word, it will have very sarcastic and rude connotation
Russia is extremely corrupt
Basically, our government only exists to steal money and most of their decisions are based on how much they can steal from it
Our Ex Prime minister had stolen over 1 billion dollars and officials ignore it
Ask any not-brainwashed Russian and he will tell you about that
Yes, but it's not wise to openly oppose Putin online or else you'll disappear
Seriously, it's a law
Pretty corrupt
Recently some wise technical men decided to fuck the humanities/economist degree way people have been trying to fight corruption and now use bots/software, and grey economy got pretty hard anal
There is definite high level corruption, every member of government has a house in London or Switzerland
That said, the cited number that Putin stole 200 billion dollars from Russia that liberals and foreigners always regurgitate is just as nonsensical
The biggest corruption I have felt is my uncle being a Colonel and helping me get out of army service
Don't forget our hopeless elections and paid media figures with their sweet oil money
> Yes, but it's not wise to openly oppose Putin online or else you'll disappear
I guess Echo Moscow, TV Rain, Navalniy and so on created an army of clones because they shit on Putin every day
Not even saying about thousands of Russians on forums
This is literally why I always refer to him as "the President" online
The guys who watch the media for people talking shit about him aren't that great at their jobs (even less so if you do it in English) but it never hurts to be careful
That's pretty much right
Also we have crazy Marxist-leninist people and other subgroups
Medvedev's just a puppet on a string who isn't smart enough to understand that
Unfortunately it's reality as well
It's illegal to spread "fake news" (anything bad about Putin), youtubers and social media figures have been arrested for such shit
You can be black listed by the government or fined/thrown in jail
It's also very hard to obtain a reliable vpn in Russia so if you violate this law online, you can be charged or institutionalized
Most media figures are paid by the government with the money they get from the sheer amount of natural resources in Russia
So most media is controlled by the state
If you're problematic to Putin's agenda and you're not thrown in the Gulag you can also be filtered from Russian media or get terminated
I don't know the details, but on the face value it's not corruption
Corruption is a government official creating illegal shortcuts for a private entity in exchange for money (or other goods) - or creating artificial barriers for those who don't bribe
What you're talking about is probably illegal, but that doesn't mean it's corruption
As, for example, tax evasion is not corruption, it's just a felony - unless a tax inspector helps you for a bribe
Lensky's aria from the opera "Eugene Onegin" by Tchaikovsky
Anna German makes (made
) some really good music
[Надежда] is another song I would add to that list
Moscow is a large city, 12 million people plus commuters
What I like:
- 24x7 availability of almost everything
- still lots of green spaces
- great public transport
- lots of places to eat out and cultural venues
What I don't like:
- it's still growing, and newer areas are marginally better than commieblock districts
- terrible car traffic
- no good medium density housing, your options are either
- commieblocks, or
- incredibly overpriced housing
- single-family homes in car-dependent suburbs
- pre-commieblock blocks with great ceiling height, but outdated floorplans and infrastructure
The terrible car traffic is our biggest problem, it would be perfect without it
It *was* perfect for a few weeks during the covid scare
Moscow without Muscovites and the guests of the capital was real nice
Yes we do, but the traffic is only sick when you are driving a car
To limit the choice, I'll start with the first tsar (Ivan IV) and ignore all previous rulers
Men: Ivan, Fyodor, Boris, Vasily, Mikhail, Alexey, Pyotr, Pavel, Alexander, Nikolai
Women: Irina, Ekaterina, Anna, Elizaveta
You can (arguably) include Sophia into women list
Probably
I didn't include it as she never ruled as Sophia
It's basically the local variation of the same name
We call the British queen Elizaveta, just like our Ekaterina and Pyotr are Catherine and Peter in English
The pronunciation is [somewhat different] obviously
Didn't Tsaritsa Elizabeth annex some parts of Finland
Ah, okay, fair enough
Dora teaches English here in Russia, too
Which is especially weird in the series where she's a tween and hangs out with her friends
They live in a *very* Latin American city, their skin tones span the tonal range from criollo to zambo and they talk to each other in Russian-accented English phrases
> Why should they learn spanish in the UK
Because they spend their summer holidays in Spain
Just like some other country does
>Chruschtschow
This looks terrifying
English spelling is Khrushchyov btw
How and why did you (germans) made 7 letters out of 1 of ours (щ)
Khrushchyov is more correct, like Semyon instead of Semen
It's a pretty common name here
I'll let younger redditors post modern earworms, but:
[Black Eyes] Oh my
I went to Sochi the year it was released, and it was playing from every
single
thing
that could play music
I swear every other song on the radio was Black Eyes
[Exhibit, aka Louboutins] More famous for its music video, like The Fox, but everyone watched it
[The Smoke of Menthol Cigarettes] Now we're going deep into the past
This was playing in every roadside cafe in the 90s. Get someone old enough and drunk enough, get then in a melancholic mood, give them a karaoke mic and you will get this
[Accountant] The first music video with a bookend plot "like in the the West". It's 29 years old, but expect any male accountant (a rare thing) to hate it with all their heart
Russia
Чёрный Бумер. It was everywhere in the 2000s.
It was a massive hit here too
A classic
No you’re not
I do too
Yes, it's one of female-dominated jobs
So all your colleagues are likely to be women, and whenever you have a birthday they are likely to come up with "let's sing 'Accountant' to him
It probably is, I just don't know modern music well enough
I have not seen any signs of panic yet
No panic buying because of a coronavirus but likely there will be panic buying because of RUB/USD exchange rates (ruble tumbled by 5% currently) after OPEC+ oil-deal failure
Yeah, i just see ppl in masks occasionally (and even that's in Moscow, not in my hometown)
Yes, there are people wearing masks, but shops are quite ok
Вселенная (vsellennaya) meaning “universe”. Every time I hear this word I’m filled with awe for some reason
Maybe it’s my brain trying to cope with the concept of infinite space
It's quite interesting word, because before 1918 "world" and "peace" were two similar yet different words: "мiръ" (world) and "миръ" (peace)
Both words are pronounced the same
"До свидания" literally means "until meet you" and is a quite formal way to say goodbye
But the word "свидание" alone in modern Russian means a romantic date
Technically it's two words
Sustainable words combination
Old slavic names like Radomir, Spiridon, Lukyan, Svyatozar and so on
Especially those names sound weird with common surnames
Just imagine Athelweard Wilson, Brunhild Taylor, etc
Zahar, Makar and Ivan
Is Michael a bad name
> Jack
It's a dog's name here too
There are so many comments about English sounding names
is it really *that* common
It seems that their popularity is on the rise
I never considered Spiridon archaic, thb
My guess is "Saint Light/Fire" (svyatoy + zar)
update: google says it means "enlightened with light".
I don't hate it but those names sound odd like naming your children with mythology names, names from centuries ago, fictional names, etc
And we also use patronymic so future kids will have it weird: Alexander Svyatopolkovich, etc
>Brunhild is Russian too
I used it as an example for English names
Pffffffahahaha
I also thought about it as "svyat
" (saint) instead of "svet".. (light for "enlightened")
Helicopter, periodic table, petrol cracking, i also wanna say Google
There are many things invented by Russians
I think that the greatest one is Periodic Table of elements by Mendeleev
Other important inventions:
- Radio is invented by Popov
- Theremin (the first electronic musical instrument) is invented by Leon Theremin
- AK-47 by Kalashnikov
- The Thermonuclear weapon by Sakharov and Ginzburg
- Laser by Basov and Prokhorov
- First satellite - sputnik
- Lunokhod - the first robotic lunar rover
- First nuclear power plant
- Helicopter by Sikorsky
- Non-Euclidean Geometry by Lobachevsky
- The incandescent light bulb by Lodygin
- Tetris
- Vodka
Isn't "robot" derived from a word that's connected with "work"?
The radio part is debatable, as you probably know
For those who don’t, look up Alexander Popov
Why Google though
I like to think that a Russian guy was the founder of such a huge company and everyone uses it everyday
> robota
> unpaid unfree work
As a Russian, I see no contradiction here /
Hm, in Russian it means just any type of work
Got it
However, Google (just as Yandex) took an idea and did a great job of developing it into a successful business rather than invented the technology in the first place
True
I know that it wasn’t appropriate to say Google, since it’s not a technology, but still
Yes
There is a word "Власовец" ("Vlasovets") which is formed from the surname of the collaborator general Vlasov
The official propaganda often labels people they don't like with this word
Also polizei (полицай) is still an insult
Also Banderovtsi
Technically speaking, they were Ukrainian and not Russian collaborators, but the term was used before and still used to this day
Although more towards Ukrainians rather than anyone else
Yes, I wanted to mention it, too, but I changed my mind because, as you have truthfully said, it is more used in a context of Ukrainians
I don't really think that they were Nazis, to be honest
They had a more of a nationalistic agenda
The situation during the war was very difficult from the moral point of view for most people, especially those who were patriotic towards the Russian Empire, because they had to choose between 2 evils: Stalin and Hitler
Frankly speaking, both sides didn't like Russia
Real Russia I mean
But still, they sided with Hitler and all
I don't approve that personally
I think that the best option if we have such a dilemma would be just to chill out and think about things that are more cheerful for our every day life ;)
If the Soviet Russia is counted, then Tetris is unrivaled, it's one of the most well-known videogames in the world
As for more recent games, then Heroes of Might and Magic 5, the King's Bounty sequels, World of Warships, War Thunder come to mind
I don't know which one is more well known
STALKER is great
Especially the voice acting
"Ну, подорвали, пацаны! Мля, я маслину поймал!" STALKER 2 when
God bless Czechia for Factorio and Space Engineers
Victoria 2
Also Vangers, which has the trippiest and the most original setting ever
Oh, I had no idea HOMM were from Russia
One of my favourite games so far, although I don't have a considerable experience
Yeah, Nival made very good effort at balancing between the classic mechanics from HoMM 3 and some novelties like the new skill tree
I still prefer HoMM 3 one, but 5 is certainly good
I tried playing the 6th one, and I didn't like it at all, it didn't play like HoMM
But it will be an online live service game
It is not necessarily a bad thing - the Zone and stalkers are pretty good material for an open world MMO sandbox
But it has very good chances to be one another forever early access bug infested survival games
Just the one that came 5 years later after the main craze for the genre
Yep, also Russian
Seems so
I haven't heard of this game
Is it famous
Wargaming is indeed a Belarusian company
However, World of Warships in particular is developed by [Lesta Studio] their subsidiary located in Saint Petersburg, Russia
As the development office and all key people in World of Warships are from Russia, I think it should be fair to attribute the game to Russia
Not the entire series, only HoMM 5
HoMM 1-4 are American, 6 is Hungarian, 7 is German
Are you subbed to Sir Troglodyte on YT
I'm not subscribed, but I know the channel
I don't know why on Earth I watched a couple of 30 minute videos about a game I no longer play, but his voice is just so soothing
Yeah, "Dark" is really solid tv-series
Top-notch production
Yet it still not beat Kommissar Rex as my favorite german-themed series)))
I want to thank Finland for all the nice things we have just over the border
>but we don't you as people
Don't view
Don't respect
Don't like
At least some Finns go to Russia too, especially in Vyborg and St
Petersburg
Russia (and other Slavic countries, I believe) is fond of [Kvass] a sort of low alcohol content beer-like beverage, sometimes carbonated
It has a history spanning thousand years, and the taste is sometimes described as liquid bread
Try it if you get a chance
English
In my opinion it just doesn't make sense to use a translation (however good it might be)n if you can use the original
Some games, however, include specific vocabulary which is connected to certain topics (I don't know what exactly
chemistry
Mechanics
) and I can understand people who use translation is such cases because your knowledge of English might be not enough
But personally, I don't play games with specific context so it is not my case
As for your edit, I usually play historical games (or fantasy like TES or TW3, but real world history is more preferable): strategic games (Paradox Interactive games), RPG games (currently playing Kingdom Come Deliverance)
I'd really like to play some RPG or adventure game about the 18th-early 19th century setting in Europe (7 years war, Napoleonic wars), but I haven't found anything in the industry that might be worth attention
English if I play alone, Russian if I play with friends (bc they don't know English well enough)
Yes if it's the game of English origin
Voices and translation usully better in this case and western developers mostly don't give a fuck about cyrillic fonts so you play with standard ones and it breaks immersion
If the game made by non-English people it sometimes better to play on Russian
Like, The Witcher is way cooler in Russian than in English
Obviously the games made by Russian speaking games (like STALKER, new King's Bounty series, Allods series etc) are much better in Russian
The only game worth listening to in czech is Mafia
I think it has some minuses, though
First, the technical aspect has some problems; sometimes the game bugs
Also the combat system becomes uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies
Finally, in the second part of the game it becomes too easy - you kill almost everyone with 2-3 hits
There are some op perks that kinda break the immersion (for example, the perk that allows you not to get hungry and tired unless you move
It literally makes the atmosphere of realism a little interrupted)
However, everything else is amazing: there are plenty of cool side quests, the visual style of landscape, models of characters, armour, etc
are excellent; despite being uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies, the combat system is great in duels
I learned a lot of things about middle-ages Czechia while playing it
Even though I haven't finished the game, I'm waiting for a sequel already
I hope it will fix things that I didn't like and make things I liked even better
One thing is for certain - KCD is a unique game and I will certainly remember this experience
I have just finished the monastery mission
P.S. I also found it strange when I learned that there is no Czech localisation, to be honest
Though sometimes they play songs in Czech on the background it cutscenes
But that doesn't has dabing
Sure
I meant the vocals (dub)
Oh, you have just started the game, I see
You have plenty of great things ahead, good luck
>Non-rural view rural as backwards, poor, stupid, and simple
Same here, except for stupid
Although people who have "rural" relatives may have a different opinion
Personally I think that I know as much as I need
Russian
I live in Russia and therefore it’s a language which everyone speaks here
Russian is my native language
English
I’m so grateful that I learned English back then just because it’s an international language and the whole world speaks English
The best language you can learn as not a native English speaker
Armenian
I’m Armenian and I have to know my natal language
Don’t forget your roots
There are a lot of Armenians in Russia so it facilitates my communication with them
I speak 8 languages and I still want to learn more because 1) I've got too much time on my hands
Someone get me a pet or something and 2) I like one spooking people in public by talking in random languages when buying groceries or somethin
Oh yes, I most certainly do
First, because I feel like knowing only English and Russian makes me backwards comparing to people around me
I don't know why, but everyone but me had 2 foreign languages (mostly took English and German/French) at school and I only had one and did not have time to attend any language courses apart from school
Second, I am majoring in History currently and I would like to build a career as a historian
I am planning to specialize on the 18th century Russia
The thing is, at that time (and later on) educated people and nobility whose writings make up a lion's of sources that a historian would work on, spoke French as their first language and used it more often than Russian, from around the middle of the century
Hence, for me it is crucial to know French (and also German, if possible) to work with those sources
Actually, I am soon going to take French classes in my university, so the problem will probably be solved in a couple of years
Then I am planning to expand my knowledge of languages - German, Italian and, maybe, Spanish
It’s the most popular language after Russian as elsewhere
But if you want to come here and feel comfortable as an English speaker, you will be disappointed
Maybe 1 out of 10 people will understand you and communicate with you
You should learn some basics and practice it
Watch a lot of videos and listen to Russian speech a lot
It will help you
I’ve seen all kinds of snow/ice sculptures but never with a candle inside, now I have to make one of those
Nuclear and thermonuclear tests aside, probably [Ufa train disaster] A gas leak on a pipeline destroyed two trains, killing 575 people
I started loving milk when I first visited Lithuania and bought some Polish milk there
It tasted very rich and sweet
How else would I make Blin
Kefir better
I don't know how to tell if milk is good quality, but it tasted better than the one I would by for the same price in Russia
I live in a very urbanised area, though
My grandmother lives on the edge of a small town and buys her milk from a barrel that delivers milk to her suburb every week
It is cheap and flavourful, but I wouldn't find that in Moscow/Moscow region
Yes
Warm milk with some honey in there always helps to recover
[Тьмутаракань] which is a medieval town of Taman Peninsula
88 mm - my favorite size
*Kto ne spryatalsya — ya ne vinovat* = "Whoever hasn't hidden, it's not my fault".
In Russian, it is «кто не спрятался — я не виноват», which literally translates to “if you haven’t found a place to hide, it’s not my fault”
in Russian it’s lopata as well (лопата)
amazing
How can it be misunderstood
Plus "не спрятался", although grammatically in the past tense, is actually talking about the present, as in "кто не спрятавшийся".
edit: I didn't notice the "if" part
Makes sense now
[Кембриджский словарь] приводит в пример такое предложение:
> Whoever they are, I don’t want to see them
Вроде, та же самая структура.
Russian is mostly the same wherever spoken
You wouldn't notice much difference in vocabulary except a couple of words throughout an entire conversation, if any
Russian is pretty uniform no matter where you are
So we don’t really have this problem
I personally would prefer if Ukrainians used Shto instead of Sho and G instead of Gh when speaking in Russia
Agreed 100%. It's so anti-Russian to say "sho" and "gh" that half of Southern Russia does that and a lot of people from Central Russia too (including most of my family)
I'm not saying it's anti Russian
I'm saying I'd prefer to hear the standard speech over these regional variations that make my ears bleed
That's all
It's similar to Turkey - his genuine supporters are uneducated ignoramuse - many of whom have never left the country, let alone learned a second language
Most educated people I speak with at the least have reservations, but Putin's whole thing is that, if people won't love him, they should at least fear doing anything
People keep their heads down and worry about themselves and their families
Some of the young just focus on emigration
There might well be a sense that "something" should be "done" but nobody wants to make the first move
That's my outlook as a foreigner living here, anyway
>who's critcs tend to "disappear", end up in prison or "accidentally" die
You know something isn't right when people who criticise Putin keep "accidentally" falling out of windows
Well, your post here is a testament tothe power of propaganda
That window falling is a meme perpetuated by cherry-picking articles is honestly the most obvious part
No, you won't get pushed out of the window for criticising Putin
Yes, there was one murder of investigative journalist who digged into Wagner PMC, however by the time he was killed he was on different task and most likely got into trouble with local crime organisation
There are great many critics of Putin in Russia, and probably top 10 of them are under any threat, it it is never a murder - ususally it's harassment and car burning etc
Most of them would have troubles with, say, becoming manager at Gazprom, and their organizations are under constant pressure, but almost none of them fear for their lives
The idea that critics of Putin get assassinated is based on a very special group of cases - Litvinenko, who was high profile security defector, and Nemtsov, whose assassination seemed to be a work of overly eager Chechen minions
Nemtsov was half-retired by then, and there were many more prominent people in opposition, and resonanse of his assassination speaks for itself in regard of frequency of such cases
It was the biggest scandal since muder of Politkovskaya
And three doctors falling out of windows is too incredibly overblown story
If any doctor who critisises Putin was thrown out of window, there would have been hundreds of cases
Two of these three were likely suicide attempts - who would have thought that during pandemic in country of 140 million people there would be several doctor's suicides
Third one was fall from second story window that didn't even kill a man who made a recovery since then (Shulepov)
This story is rather standart - yes, he critizised his superior who forced him to work despite having coronavirus
Rather petty affair
After social reaction, he was put into coronavirus hospital
When he recovered from ilness but was still confined to hospital, he once decided to smoke a cig and for that he tried to jump from window to rain roof over the entrance to hospital, but slipped and fell to the ground
Putin's assassins at their finest
As you can see, few cases of cherry picking by Western media(tm) - and reddit believes that in Russia criticising goverment will put you on hit list of Putin's defenestrators
When you wonder why Russians are this or that, remember that your vision of Russia is clouded in propaganda, as is vision of Russians themselves, so how you see things is wildly different
> I don't understand how the Russian regime thinks they have a right to steal the territory of other countries (like Crimea), and stage fake elections "proving" their "right" to steal said territory
Do you really not undertsand it or do you just express your condemnation this way
If you really don't undertsand it, there is a fuckton of resources about Russian stance on Crimea
Educating yourself on that rather important issue is probably worthwhile
In short: Russia considers annexation to be the will of Crimean people who were against Euromaidan and following coup
There is a rather solid framework under that kind of claims to people's self determination, even though Russia and many other countries usually supress any kind of sepratism
Among Russian society, belief that Crimea should have been Russian was always widespread because of historical ties
> I don't understand how the Russian regime can say other countries who don't have nukes or nowhere near the same amount of troops as them (like Norway), is "threatening" a nuclear power like Russia
By threataning Russian officials don't mean that they worry Norway will conquer Russia on its own
However Norway is in military alliance with powerful countries that oppose Russia
You can learn about this alliance more here  [
And us as well
You've got everything right
People who would fight for their rights don't do it because there is not enough solidarity
With how things are now, anything less than "all in" won't make a difference
And you just know you can't trust your neighbor to cover your back
Kind of
Drakon - any type of dragon
Zmej - the type of dragon in Slavic mythology
Vozdušnyj zmej - kite (literally "air zmej")
Zmeja - snake
> Zmej - the type of dragon in Slavic mythology
And most things called "serpent" in English
Zeleniy zmei - alchoholism
When I was little, I thought "змей" just meant male snake
Eat at McDonald’s. Why
I heard Germans rapidly treat fascists or those silly people screaming something like that
Is it really true
Is it true that you can get into jail if do some stuff connected with Nazi-Germany, swastika etc
Hamburg sounds really awesome
Feel like it would be one of my favorite places in Germany
We call it regions
Also zamkad'je - beyond MKAD (moscow automobile ring road)
There is Moscow and there is Russia
It is 2 different worlds
It is called провинция (province)
The difference is that it is used not only by people in Mocow, but also by people in the "second" capital, St
Petersburg
I cycled through Paris and can tell Parisian driving style (including cycling) is something
To summarize my experience, there's a Parisian cycling club called Suicidal Urban Riders
Tie in russian is Galstuk comes from German Halschtuck
Hard to pick a favourite, Russian has loads of loanwords
I really like *циферблат* (eng
clock face, germ
*Zifferblatt*), because it had never even occurred to me that it's a loanword until I started learning German, it just doesn't sound very foreign (e.g. French loanwords are very obviously french-sounding)
In German, *Zifferblatt* is simply "numbers+sheet of paper".
Another favourite is *шлагбаум* (I'm having trouble translating that into English
A turnpike
A gate
) It's basically a long pole that is lowered across the road in order to prevent cars from driving through (e.g. at a level railway crossing)
Anyway, I really enjoy the fact the in German, *Schlagbaum* literally translates to "falling/hitting piece of wood". Why didn't the Russian speakers think of that themselves
Bonus fact: apparently, nowadays German speakers don't really use *Schlagbaum* anymore and say *Schranke* instead (because *Schlagbaum* means there's like a person lifting this thing to let somebody through, and the correct word for a modern, automated gate is *Schranke
* In case there are any native German speakers reading this: Stimmt es
Yep, there are so many German words in Russian, it's unbelievable
Ones I could think of: Kurort, Kamin, Dübel, Streikbrecher, дуршлаг ("durshlag", eng
colander, from germ
*durchschlagen*)
Tatar, which is a turkic language in the Volga region with a population of around 5 million people (the size of Finland), which coexist with Russians in one country since 16 century and long before it as neighbours
What do native Finns think about Russians
Are they mostly anti-immigrant or maybe they don't really care
That's surprising
I would expect Turkish to be the second, and Russian to be in the first 5—10 languages
PS: a lot of Russians actually abused the program and used forged documents as "proof" of their German ancestry just to get out of Russia
> it's Russian if you only look at citizens
There was some easy way to get an EU citizenship through buying a property in Cyprus or something like that
Nobody speaks tatar to be honest
Then it's Russian and not Tatar, since not just Tatars speak Russian as the second language
I’ve met people who do
Are those Russians mostly tourists
They just know the language, but do they really use in their life
I visited Kazan a few years ago, and I often heard people speaking Tatar on the streets, including young people (teenagers and 20s)
I also heard a lot of code-switching between Russian and Tatar
They are computer-illiterate, but then I realized I am "car-illiterate": I know what the buttons on the dash do, but I have no idea how to perform any basic maintenance beyond adding more petrol or window washing fluid
Most of you are probably "bread-illiterate": you know how to buy bread, but not how to bake it
Even if you can bake it after the quarantine, you don't know how to grow and harvest wheat and to turn it into flour
I am an engineering student but I barely understand how a *radio* works, so actually understanding how my PC works is our of reach for now :/ I was growing up when computers were already heavily advanced, complicated and fairly widespread so just as the most of my peers, I am slightly good at using them (and sometimes some weird shit happens which I have no idea how to fix so I just format the entire disk and reinstall windows) and I can even put one together (with a lot of blunders) but my understanding of the physics behind them is non-existent
Not weird spellings, but we have Наталья/Наталия. Also, some male names can produce different patronymics: Валерьевич/Валериевич, Евгеньевич/Евгениевич, Никитич/Никитович *shudder*. People with и instead of ь spend their whole lives spelling out their names
"Ваши ФИО? - Иванова Наталия-через-и Евгениевна-тоже-через-и."
I once worked with a family here in Russia who told me they needed a teacher for their son "Eugene
" I'd assumed they'd called him that when we first spoke on the phone as a sort of way to make me feel comfortable with a foreign name
I arrive and I say "this must be little Zhenya
(Yevgeniy)
"No, his name is *Eugene
I don't know why, but I just found it sort of ludicrous; I don't really see the purpose in giving your kid a "foreign" name when that name already had its equivalent within your own language
Obviously people are free to do what they want, but I still consider it odd
>"No, his name is Eugene
So, Юджин? His kids patronymics will be interesting if that's really his official name in the documents
Though of course names are quite easy to change if one wants to
Yep, the name in his documents was, apparently, Юджин.
> His kids patronymics will be interesting if that's really his official name in the documents
Can't be worse than Оле говна.
Like *they* are pieces of shit, and they can blame their grandparents for that
I write a lot better than I speak, for sure
Still had to repeat what I was saying several times, every time I opened my mouth in the UK
> Don't be ashamed of your English and quit ending your posts with "sorry for my English, I'm [insert nationality]".
We should modify the subreddit style next April Fools so every comment ends with this line
How's it going on this sub then
:) I guess it's kinda hard to read posts if you don't know English
And also I often find myself trying to translate some phrases from my native language to English
Even though that's a common mistake, I just don't know how to say the same thing in English
Please excuse my English
Geordies are a breed apart
Even I couldn't understand them
>they must have some form prepositions I suppose, but IDK
Of course we do, but it can happen because we also have cases and many situations which in English depend on prepositions in Slavic languages depend on cases instead
So people struggle without needed case but don't know what to use to replace it

Russia has only two allies - the army and navy
Among countries I think better candidate is Belarus
If we exclude ex-USSR countries so I don't know maybe Serbia=)
China I think
for a few last years
Lmao
Russia doesn't have friends and probably never will
Even Belarus tries to find other relationships when it can
Belarus cause we were one thing from very start
No fucking way Chinese are our allies
They are spreading their influence in Central Asia, steal our technologies, try to exploit Siberia’s resources in the most barbaric way and undoubtedly would grab as much of Far East as they can if we become too weak
They are useful to make Americans busy and somewhat weaker, though
Canada is American Belarus, huh
It is seen from Russia as an opportunistic weathervane
Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Venezuela
An alliance anyone would dream of
But Russians don't claim that that Finland is a friend to begin with
Russia
Can you be more specific
What's wrong with spreading their influence in Central Asia
What technologies did they steal
How are they trying to exploit Siberia's resources if they can't access to it
Well, we were certainly very abusive friends to each other :x There was a time when Russia was an inch away from destroying Prussia and then Tsaritsa Elizabeth died; to be replaced by a dude who worshiped the ground Frederick the Great walked on
Before the um
/*clears throat*/ other Russian empress had him killed
You even wrote Russia with a small letter and Germany with a capital
How can we talk about a friendship
Anyone except the similarly lonely kid who compensates by studying obsessively and screwing his other classmates\* (China); or the sporty, handsome, rich dude who everyone orbits around but no one really likes (USA)
\*screwing as in making unadvantageous deals
I realized what that could also mean after I commented it lol
Belarus almost literally means it
There word Rus - the name of ancient Russia
Russia is greek form of Rus and Belarus mean White Rus
Belo-(or Bela-) it mean white
Geopolitical influence is a zero sum game
If they gain influence, we lose it
It is wrong because if we lose control over Central Asia the whole soft underbelly of Urals and Siberia would be defenseless
From economical point of view, Russian corporations benefit from business in Central Asian markets and Russia as a whole benefits from thousands of migrants working in Russian economy
Engines, planes, missiles, rockets, some ships
Look at their air force and say that those are 100% indigenous design
Their 5th gen fighter flies on Russian engines
Very easily
They find an alcoholic from a Siberian village, give him a bottle of vodka and he opens a company that starts digging gold/cutting trees/whatever
On paper it is Russian company owned by a Russian, but in reality the capital, management, employees, trade partners and clients are Chinese
And obviously the company will disregard all common sense and exploit the land it owns in the most barbaric way possible
Seven Years War, if made as an HBO adaptation would be heavily criticized for unrealistic plot twists for the sake for plot twists
> Rus - the name of ancient Russia
*A million of Ukrainians screamed and fell in silence*
Yeah
Beat that, EU
*sobs*
Lol no
We just don't have that kind of a connection to you anyway
Finland lost the war against USSR
interesting
ok, partly you may be right
A million descendants of the ancient great Ukr who dug the black sea
I don't care about their opinion
All Ukrainians whom I know are normal in history and know that the division of peoples into Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians occurred much later than Ancient Russia and all three peoples have the right to be called descendants of Ancient Rus
Our president
Laundry and the Ministry of Culture
I think, we can't even name all the local memes we have in runet)
We have exact the same in Russian, it's actually more popular than the other version
Basically whoever answers from Ministry of Culture mocks a word "laundry" in a rude way (making it similar to swear word) and is strikingly uncultured but proud to work in a Ministry of Culture itself and not in some laundry
Хуячечная (more like cuntaundry) is usually mentioned when our Ministry of Culture fucks up again, it's their code name
Why were some of the answers keelhauled all of a sudden
Creepy af
Oh shit, the mosquitoes
They ate me alive when I was in a similar region in Russia, and even sprays didn't help
> Now that I'm older I realize it was most likely some lazy bastard taking this route as a shortcut in bad weather
This is so weird, but I'd like to try something like that
This is hilarious, I saved your comment for future reference
1) "Kak skazhesh" meaning "as you [wish to] to say".
2) "Spravedlivo" or "rezonno" meaning fair/just/reasonable
I believe in some context you also could’ve been said “Ладно, проехали» or “Ладно, едем дальше” which is somewhat similar to “okay, let’s get over it” and literally means that you suggest to continue your ride
I guess "Jak chcesz" corresponds to "Kak hochesh" (meaning "as you want")
It can also be used as an equivalent of "fair enough", but it has a connotation of an uncomfortable compromise
One first name + [Patronimic] \+ one surname
Almost always wife will take her husband's surname, but she can also take a double surname (smth like Putin-Medvedeva, very rare) or it can be the other way around: husband will take his wife's surname (for example, if husband's surname means smth very unpleasant, exceptionally rare)
Native Siberian here, probably dead
If not, probably hunting for fur to trade/pay yasak (taxes)
Nowadays most commonly believed to live in [Veliky Ustyug] But Arkhangelsk and the Kola Peninsula have also been contenders
Isn't this place like the official residence of Santa
Like worldwide
Suprisingly wholesome
Xp or Vista I think is used in different organizations for billboards
I guess they don't really need more
My uncle used to work in a newspaper as a system administrator and he told me the story
On some kind of conference, where japanese scientists and techs came to Moscow to present something like 2gb hard drive or similiar thing, one journalist from this newspaper had a chance to make a long conversation with one of the scientists about tech parts of this invention
In the end japan guy suggested to leave some info for this journalist and asked for a flashcard or something
And then journalist came up with floppy disk
While their country is going into gygabyte era, we have this
Not even cd
Japan guy looked really stunned and ended up conversation rly fast
I love the story of BolgenOS
Some schoolkid from Siberia reskinned a common Linux distro for his school project and played it up as a new Russian-native OS
He got away long enough with it for the regional media to pick up the story and hail him as a homegrown wunderkind hacker
They even tried to defend his honor when actual sysadmins heard the news and started mocking him
Bless you
«Пошлый» (poshly, adjective) and «пошлость (poshlost’, noun)
It translates to vulgar, banal, platitudinous and all at the same time
I wanted to say exactly the same thing about Russian
Of course, there are sometimes other ways to express these nuanced meanings in English, but it's difficult to learn them because you can't just google a handy list of common particles
Hm, just like in Ukrainian
The word smazcny is also used here in Russia
["Ship-house" or "Home of Atomists"] This is so ugly and monstrous
Well, soviets built it, what else could I expect
[Also this is how a default Russian bedroom district or a suburb area looks like] . Nowadays these districts sometime gets mixed with modern, a bit less uglier but taller warrens
We've got enough of them that there's a top (bottom
) 100:
I especially hate 46, 45, 40, 29, 27, 26, 18, 12 and 7
All of them except 12 are from Moscow, and thus I can actually be offended by how they look often enough, and 12 is just soul-crushing
Moscow City as a district:
I would say that half of them looks ok
There is a lot of really ugly but not all
Varlamov is a good blogger urbanist but he is often very biased
Last one (#1) is straight up cool
Or like a citadel from Half Life 2 or something
We had "Fundamentals of Orthodox culture", "Fundamentals of Islamic culture", "Fundamentals of Buddhist culture", "Fundamentals of Jewish culture", "Fundamentals of world religious cultures" and "Fundamentals of secular ethics" and parents should have choose one of those subjects in 4th grade, but I heard that now there's only last two subjects left
Yes, in the 4th grade we had a class in which we were taught basic aspects of all major religions or (if our parents expressed a desire to) of the Orthodox Christianity/Islam specifically
Also in the 9th grade we had a class that taught us about the history of Christianity in our region of Russia
We learned about the major architectural sights that were connected with the Church, some local saints and stories of their lives, etc
My parents chose secular ethics so I didn't, I think it was in world religious cultures
I’d just make a new one, closer to Siberia
That place really needs some economic incentives to develop
Troll option: Kiev
Literal middle of the country: Noriljsk
Mean centre of population: somewhere on the shores of Kama in Udmurtija
Close to Transsib, so a high-speed train line to Moscow is a possibility
You’re right; Chelyabinsk is a great location
But since I’m from Yekaterinburg, I have an obligation to make a counter proposal to move the capital to it lol
We're very important because Russia, as the main aggressor, takes dissatisfaction with internal problems of European countries from them
It is also easy to blame her, both correctly and incorrectly
We're used to it
We are playing the role of the enemy  and often fairly
And, of course, we have some oil and gas
It's a mixed bag, but most downsides come from the fact that it's poorly managed and doctors underpaid, not from being free, because it's not
You can still go to a private clinic if you like, and even though it's not a pleasant spending for most people, it's still a fraction of what you'd have to pay in the US even taking the discrepancy in wages into account
> Yes, there are downsides like people abusing the system or leeching from it
In Russia, old grannies who have nothing to do will queue up starting from 7am to "measure blood pressure". That's basically how they socialise and it's quite innocent if you ask me, but what would be some other ways to abuse healthcare
Of course, you will ignore the fact that a) a lot of (most
) immigrants *are* contributors because they came to their new country exactly for employment reasons, and b) that a lot of citizens are *not* contributors (children, students, unemployed people
But as others have noted, your response is very factually incorrect regardless (although I guess the details might probably depend on the exact country, but it's not like you're presenting it)
Well, it's usually the customers themselves who pay for "free" stuff because it's part of a purchase
And yeah, that's the exact thing I'd say in that situation
But back to your own analogy
Everyone who has an income gives away their own share, or who do you think is the "owner"?
Most European languages make no sense to me since I don't speak them
I would like to say Eesti, but since i started to listening their rap it became less wierd,so id say Turkish
Moreover, Portuguese sounds like "gibberish Russian".
It is still not as strange as Chinese counting system
When 1 million is a hundred of ten thousands, that’s beyond good and evil
You are "behind" the computer in Russian too
Never thought about that, lmao
> why so many genders
How about [Tuyuca] with 50-140 noun classes
Two types of plurals
If you're referring to the dual number, it's only found in Slovene, Sorbian, and some dialects of Serbo-Croatian
*dragostea din tei*
It's more of a Polish speaking Spanish, both are fond of nasals and sibilants
Yes, it just sounds like you use the Russian sounds but different words
Russian and Porruguese have very similar phonetics
The alphabets are very similar and work on the same principle
If you know one of them, you can easily learn the other one (and all Russians, maybe save some hypothetical exceptions, know the Latin alphabet)
I'm Russian and I agree your language does sound similar to mine
> was
It is still used during messes, isn’t it
That sounds really similar to Russian, and that's one of the problems that learners face while learning the language
Ah, yeah, that's very weird
It could be rendered in English as "cats", "1 cat", "2—4 of cat", "5—20 of cats", and then again (and that's until you start declining the numerals themselves
) :D
Portuguese sounds like SEX to me
If sex was a language, it would be Portuguese
Yeah, that's actually one of the similarities
Portuguese, like Russian but unlike Spanish, reduces unstressed vowels a lot (actually Spanish sounds a bit aggressive to me because they don't reduce the vowels; it feels like they are shouting, even if they aren't)
Being Russian, I was often told by my Portuguese/ Brazilian friends that Russian is the weirdest-sounding language that they'd heard
So I asked them to speak Portuguese
I heard that cadence, the fluidity of the language, the subtle nasal vowels and I was sorta turned-on, ngl
Idk, it's just very smooth, very sensual and it FLOWS, if you know what I mean
Just like sex
I like how it sounds because it sounds similar to Russian, and Russian/any Slavic language is very pleasant to my ear
To me, neither Russian nor German sounds brutal
I guess the brutality of German is more of a stereotype, and I actually understand how it's seen as brutal when I watch how Hitler is depicted in movies and the like
The thing is that no one actually speaks like that in real life, and, to me German sounds really soft and pleasant
On the other hand, Spanish, French and Italian sound harsh to me, despite the clichés about "the most romantic languages in the world".
In Russia our school day starts at 8
30 am
Usually we have like 6-7 lessons per day (so this means that the school day ends at 2
30 pm or 3
30 pm)
One school our is 45 mins
After every lesson we have a break (15 mins after first, the same after second and third
A break after fourth lesson is 20 mins, after 5th is 30 mins
And 15 mins after 6th lesson again)
Second breakfast (so we call it) starts after the second lesson, but honestly the food there is not really tasty and I'm usually not really hungry till then, so I always skip it
Lunch time for 9-11 years/graders starts at 12
10 pm (after the 4th lesson)
Lunch for 5-8 years/graders is at 1
15 pm
You can also use a buffet (I hope, this is the right word to use
This is the place where you can buy snacks or something) after the second lesson as I remember
The canteen closes at 2
45 pm
The Library opens up after the second lesson and stays open till i-don't-know-when
Sometimes our librarian has some other things to do (some concerts that they are to attend to be in the jury and so on)
In those cases the library might be closed earlier
Well, this is pretty much everything I could remember
If I remember something else, I'll make an update
January 7
The Russian Orthodox Church still uses the Julian calendar, so their December 25 translates January 7 in the real world
Because it's after the New Year, Christmas is not celebrated much outside of the religious context, it's just another day of the winter holidays for others
The main celebrations happen on the New Year, so starting from December 31 and into the night of January 1
January 7th, which is a common date for countries that are/were majorly Orthodox Christian
Although it's a national holiday, it's nowhere near New Year in popularity
It's not celebrated mostly because the Soviet regime made NY a thing
It wasn't going to allow Christmas to remain a big deal
> Both my parents' families live roughly 120 km from us
Russians and Americans: oh, it's so convenient to live so close to your parents
Usually by clothes
Large mink coats and hat,leather jaket, or tight T-shirt with a huge [RUSSIA] inscription on both sides
I noticed it when i was in Karlovy Vary
Oh god oh fuck
Yeah, those eyes look stereotypically French to me
I've been to UK three times, but funnily enough, have never been to London
I'm in academia, so I had to visit Cambridge for a student conference and poster presentation (we had a boat trip across the city river and lived in a Harry Potter-like school, complete with looong dinner tables), Glasgow for a science outreach event (I expected locals to have incomprehensible accents, but it was actually fine), and Manchester for a kidney conference (all the students and professors went to a Chinese restaurant after the event, I saw a bull kidney on the menu and thought "well, I study them, time to find out what they taste like")
They are somewhat softer than the beef by texture, but not as soft as mushrooms
The taste was mostly  hot Chinese spices, but I enjoyed it
Would eat it again if I had the chance
Imagine how many minds can be blown when they found out that Hungary, a country, also has its own regions
Crazy stuff
> CNMI
Clothed Nebraska, Maked Illinois
I realise that
But country size isn't relevant here, I'm just joking about the fact that other countries do have their own regions, which might actually surprise some people
Thats the good thing about slavic languages
We can switch word orders to make it sound better or worse
In Russian, the word order still sometimes matter
- Я не могу больше пить: I can’t drink any more
- Я могу больше не пить: I can stop drinking
Finnish
Since I live really close to Finland, I figured I'd give it a try
"*How hard could it be
I've learned hard languages before*."
I gave up after two days
As for European countries, it's Hungarian
Tricky pronunciation and writing, difficult grammar
German yeah, wayyyy too many grammar rules
I’m from Russia and I think that Russian and Chinese are the hardest languages
Our teachers told us that Russian grammar is one of the hardest to learn and understand
Maybe we should just both stick to English, eh
Belter wee cow, aye
Gaun irn bru
I wish
(I live in France, I’m from Russia)
It’s much better than what I’m used to
Irish people, how often do you use Irish language in your everyday life
I've heard that language situation in Ireland is very bad and Irish language is going extinct
Is that true
a very large amount of Russian women believe in horoscope, astrology, etc
across all generations, and a vile feedback loop has been created where because they like it TV shows and media aimed at women seek to include more of this stuff, which in turn makes them like it more, which makes more of it added to media, etc
etc
Same thing with "psychics" which woman of all ages eat up like candy
There's also a lot of shit about aliens, major tv channels regularly run stuff on the level of america's ancient aliens show, this being more what poisons men's minds
A  lot of people in Russia believe that USSR has never dissolved, and we are all occupied by Russian government
They call our passports "Ausweis"(if i remember correctly an ID used by Third Reich on occupied territories) and prove that with some stupid shit about documents signed in 1991 (like USSR here called Russian Federation, so those documents are not in power)
NFKRZ made a video on this
* Horoscopes, crowns of celibacy, spells are popular among most women
* China makes low-quality goods on purpose to harm Russian people with hidden toxic materials
* The US placed a chemical laboratory in Georgia to attack the Russian population with new viruses
Looks like 11 centuries is not enough to convert pagans to Christianity
Lol
Exactly what I mean
Otherwise sane people will shill this stuff and it fucking sucks, I hate having to deal with it from my mother and cousins
there's also a little bit of that in Russia, like apparently it's really bad luck to step over someone
Absolute bs
I also hate dealing with wannabe astrologers and homeopaths
I was absolutely livid when a vet prescribed homeopathic injections to my cat (травматин)
The cat (just like the Russian Academy of Sciences) doesn’t believe in homeopathy so the placebo effect is impossible
Why torture the creature
And it was a private clinic
I used to enjoy crackpot shows on Ren TV about aliens and mutants and conspiracies
[This guy] is also pretty entertaining
39% of Europe is Russia bro
Early 2000s was nice for this crackpot and conspiracy since there was less pseudoscience and it was more just historic recounting of past stuff with interviews and stuff, it never implied what was said was true
But as the stuff has to be made more normie accessible and entertaining they turn it to bullshit
"war of the psychics" was also really bad, which I forgot to mention in OP
It's not the same thing as astrology but it ties in very strong, largely with the same female demographic
Well, its in the eye of the beholder
In the eyes of Chinese Russia is as Western as Germany and France
Russian wikipedia is the 6th largest wikipedia, so it's quite big and comprehensive
The only problem is that a lot of politically sensitive topics are not written from a neutral point of view because there are too many editors pushing their pro-Russia POV
I think this started in 2014 after Ukranian Euromaidan, and many Ukraine-related articles are not neutral
One has to say that Ukranian wikipedia is even worse in this regard, but that's not the point
English wiki is somewhat better because there are simply more editors, but still there are popular articles where a group of people are pushing their POV
The best example is [Russo-Georgian\_War] it's really one-sided
I mostly use Wikipedia to read about languages and linguistics and I find that English Wikipedia tends to be more comprehensive in this area
Hell, even many articles about Russian are more informative in English
Sometimes, though, the Russian version can be more complete, and then I switch to Russian
I use Russian WP for articles about Russian towns, rivers and minor historical figures
For other topics I use the English WP
It depends on region
I work in a hotel and a lot of people from different Russian regions come here (Caucasus, Pyatigorsk) and ask my staff about drinking tap water
They ask if it’s clean here
A lot of people from Moscow ask that question by the way
I drink tap water all my life though
In Vyborg (an old Swedish town, so I would count it as Europe even though it's Russia now) there's little to no restoration going
It's a big hit on old European culture because the architecture of 17th, 18th, 19th centuries is getting withered and not restored at all and even if it is quite badly
The city had already list a lot of buildings and great sights during the war so the situation is pretty bad
Only now with citizens rising up the local government started working a little bit on it and the main square looks nice now
That's still tons of work to do
Not worse than any other traffic incident
Trams usually derail on turns or junctions, where speeds are low (at least in St
Petersburg, it also happens often here)
Interesting=) We have a very similar idiom here in Siberia
Siberian is not who doesn't feel cold
Siberian  is who dresses warmly
Agreed on bar food in Korea
In many countries bar food is very crappy and mediocre, but Korean bars usually have very good fried chicken
Found food in Canada to be very interesting
Could eat poutine and tourtiere 24/7
Also loved the bakeries all over the city
Sometimes it feels nice to take a taxi ride where the driver is in complete silence, and for people to give you a meter of personal space
But I think living in such a culture for years will become maddeningly impersonal and even depressing
If I have a bad day, having a nice chat with a barista or taxi driver can be massive in lifting up my mood
I didn't know Köln is Cologne, but Köln I heard of
Next one is Zaragoza
Sorry, my fellow Spaniards
Duisburg
By the way, I remember how a few years ago I was surprised by the fact that Cologne is German
I mean, it doesn't sound like a German name at all
Gothenburg and Bochum
Turns out the first one was just Göteborg, so I expected Bochum to be another anglicized spelling, like Gothenburg, Leghorn and Nuremberg
But no, Bochum was unknown to me
Köln
Yes, this variant of a name is more familiar to me
That depends on which languages you already speak, but the simplest advice I could give is don't get hung up on the alphabet
Learning a language takes years (regardless of the language), while learning the alphabet will take you a few hours to a few days
Strč prst skrz krk is after a all a valid sentence
Started to learning it few days ago, where are you finding content on Swedish
Why does everyone seem put off by genitive plural
Why is it more difficult than other case-number combinations
> As in, they tend to have less and less rules and more exceptions to those rules
The loss in morphology is usually compensated with new syntactic rules
For instance, English lost cases but developed a strict word order, while most Slavic languages have cases and a rather free word order
Sometimes the opposite is happening when syntactic forms (such as particles) merge with words and create inflection
Currently, in Serbian there are 2 ways to form the future tense: one is by using an auxiliary verb + the infinitive of a meaning verb, as in "ću (auxiliary) pokušati (infinitive)"; the other one is by inflecting the verb itself, as in "pokušaću". The suffix "ću" is actually the result of merging between the infinitive and the auxiliary verb
That's how new inflection paradigms evolve in languages
Cases can emerge in a similar manner through the fusion between prepositions + nouns
I've read somewhere that many languages evolve in cycles between analyticity (grammar is mainly contained in syntax) and syntheticity (grammar is mainly contained in morphology)
> Latin has six cases, and so does Ancient Greek, Italian and other Romance languages have none, German has four
I'm not sure of what the main ancestor of Finnish could be considered, but either your language changed little with time and for some reasons didn't go throught the same process as most other languages, or they must have had an unrealistic number of cases
All the languages you've mentioned except Finnish are Indo-European and are said to have the same origin of their cases (just German has lost some of its cases and it can be speculated that it's currently in the process of losing the genitive case; Spanish has 6 cases for personal pronouns)
Finnish isn't an Indo-European language, so it's case system is quite different from the other languages you're talking about
But it has to be said that this cycle can take time different to other languages
Czech has 7 cases Russian has officially 6, 7th is unofficial
Development on that part was slow
Still trying, so hard to find something especially with subtitles compared to English and Russian
So it's 9 million Swedish speaking people and that's explaining it all
Genitive in German is used in a limited number of situations, such as showing possession or using it when required by a preposition or a verb (which there are few)
Like the other commenter says, genitive is often replaced by dative, and possession is indicated by other constructions
The Wiki article about [Swiss German] says that Swiss German doesn't have genitive whatsoever except some dialects that indicate possession with genitive
Yes, would be nice leave it here, people who learning svenska will find it handy in this thread

The knowledge that Eastern Europe lives in a parallel universe
Can you say "A with B" instead of "A and B" in Dutch
I don't remember the exact terminology, but that's a feature shared by a number of European languages, including Russian and not including English
I used to say "how is it called
" in English, but I've been corrected by native speakers multiple times
That's considered to be a typical mistake made by native Russian speakers
Perhaps there's a regional variation in English, so it's acceptable in Ireland
Perhaps it's the influence of Irish Gaelic
I've read you guys have quite a few of those (like "I'm just after doing something
" instead of "I have just done something" etc
That's more like a single item
What about less connected pairs, like "Me with my friends went to the park" or even "Could you buy some cigarettes with vegetables on your way home"?
Americans, Brits and Australians
Right
But that would be perfectly acceptable in Russian
Our mothers say 3, 5, 6, 7 from your list too
There's definitely more, but I can't remember any
> were you born in a barn
Ours say "were you born in an elevator
I heard only 3, 6 and 7
Never heard anything like this
Maybe you didn't pick your nose that much because I definitely did
I have
The explanation is that you don't need to close elevator doors because they close on their own
Same here with cuts and bruises: "it'll get better by your wedding". I actually cut my palm on a sewing machine chassis a few days before my wedding and didn't find this remark funny at all
Oh, I see
But still never heard it in my childhood (born and raised in Moscow)
As someone who have been several times in England, i am telling you that the first law is REALLY not enforced ahaha
Is it really illegal to keep a hamster alone or did you just use an example of an animal you thought needed a buddy to live with to be happy
Hamsters are extremely solitary animals so it would be weird and harmful
Idk out of all of this and the only thing that really weirded me out was the part of having a buddy for you hamster, lol
90% of time - yes
Most of the time yes
However, there are some ambiguous situations:
* how should I spell that unstressed vowel
(most of the time, you have 2 alternatives but sometimes more; like "o" vs "a")
* is that voiceless consonant at the end of a syllable spelled as voiceless or voiced
(like "т" vs "д")
* is that consonant spelled the way it sounds or is that a simplified pronunciation of a consonant cluster
(like "сч" pronounced as "щ")
* does this consonant cluster have any silent letters that aren't pronounced due to assimilation
(like "ndsk" pronounced as "nsk")
Perhaps there are more, but these come up immediately
Russian
In almost all cases you will determine and know spelling of each word
Not if it's a word you've never heard before
Then unstressed a/o and и/е will trip you up
Speakers of Russian have an easier time deciding whether it should be "ó" vs "u" or "rz" vs "ż" because they correspond to different sounds in Russian ("ó" -> "o", "u" -> "u", "rz" -> soft (palatalised) "r", "ż" -> "ż")
I guess the point is that is sounded like Dutch
Ukrainian uses "i" when it formerly had "o"/"e" and in the following syllable it had "ь"/"ъ" ("печь/pechь" became "пiчь/pichь"; "носъ/nosъ" became "нiс/nis")
However, in inflected forms, "о"/"е" is kept when it's followed by another syllable ("пiчь" -> "печi"; "нiс" -> "носа")
Also, it uses "i" when it formerly had "ѣ", and in this case it's kept in all forms ("хлiб/hlib" etc
That happens in many languages over time (look at English, French, Russian, and Danish; their spelling is more atrocious than Polish)
Spelling is always changing more slowly than language
And Poles say "drzewo" ("джево")
Ukrainian is closer to Polish in terms of vocabulary but to Russian in terms of phonology
My favorite one would be “the white friend”, so “throwing up” would sound like “hugging the white friend”.
I heard some people calling it “The Tundra”
My favorite one is "кабинет задумчивости" (roughly translates as "the cabinet of thoughtfulness")
I'm pretty sure I heard that in some cartoon
My grandmother calls it that too
Harry, you don't suppose to speak Parseltongue near muggles
My primary school English teacher pronounced "that's right" as "zats right" and I always assumed she was saying the Russian word "zasrat" as I wasn't really good at English
The Russian word means "to shit all over something".
And mine to "maia hi" (sorry to any Romanians here if the spelling makes your eyes bleed, but I found different versions in google, so I don't know which one is correct)
> As someone learning Spanish: where
Which words
My life is a lie
Everywhere except in the beginning of a word after a pause, or after n, m, l.
If you don't get bored with the IPA notation for sounds, you might like the [Wiki article about Spanish phonology] Those articles exist for most "popular" languages
Once Ivan Grozny died shit hit the fan
But wait
We found his long dead son Dmitriy
This time for real
He somehow still alive YEARS after his death, speaks Polish, doesnt recognize anyone, acts not like Russian
Looks like our guy, right
Oh wait no, it took time but we discovered he was Polish agent, so we killed him, burned him and shoot his ashes into direction of Warsaw
But wait
We found his long dead son Dmitriy
This time for real
He somehow still alive YEARS after his death, speaks Polish, doesnt recognize anyone, acts not like Russian
Looks like our guy, right
We did it 14 times
Yes there was 14 LzheDmitriys (False-Dmitriy)
During the Napoleonic Wars, the people of Hartlepool [reportedly hanged a monkey that washed up on shore as a French spy
New plan, reconstruct bunkers and fortification om border into distilleries
Same happened to Finland and he rejected the throne and all the other candidates were also from Germany which they didn't really want to align with (in 1918 when Germany was losing) so Finland became a republic
Right, sorry
We are that bad
In school i was like "okay, that was dumb
Okay THAT time that was dumb
Okay THAT ti
wait how many times you fell for it

Any information on how the ship that was sank was named
I have a Soviet-era book about all naval ships of Soviet Russia of Civil War times, but I don't remember this moment
Probably wasn't mentioned for censorship reasons, as USSR and Czechoslovakia were allies in 1981
> so it literally means "country where the language of the people is spoken".
Everyone from a Slavic language background knows that you guys don't speak a language
Germans are called "niemcy" (or similar words), literally "mute people".
We're actually advised to eat ice-cream when having a cold as it helps to ease throat pain
So Czechia and Slovakia were part of Austro-Hungary
In WWI Austro-Hungary was against Russia, and many mobilised Czechs and Slovaks (I don't know how to make this form, I'm sorry) didn't want to kill other Slavs and deserted
In Russia, their position was much different from position of other prisoners of war, and they were allowed to retain their arms
After February revolution there were ideas of Russia capitulating, but Chechoslovakians didn't want to give up
Since Russia was divided from allies by Germany, Austro-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria, it was decided to tranfer them via Pacific to USA and then via Atlantic to Britain and France
Problems began when it turned out that Transsib (a railroad that was used to tranfer Czechoslovakians to Pacific) was in bad condition
Even though Soviet authorities claimed that this plan is still desired to be completed, a lot of rumors (I don't know how truthful they were) began among Czechoslovakians that Soviets actually wanted to mobilize them into Soviet army
Since Czechoslovakians were all over the Transsib, they probably caused more problems to Soviet Russia than intervention of Britain and France in North Russia — remember their privilege over ordinary prisoners of war, permission to retain arms
TIL a shamrock is not a four leaf clover, but another name for a regular clover
Alright, I found that one
In this Soviet book it's said "in August 1918 due to bad technical condition and inaccessibility of repair after damage in the battle Байкал was disarmed and reverted to civil service and was scrapped after Civil War ended".
Even if it was really just an irreparable damage, and even more so if it actually was sinking, good job on dealing with ice-strengthened (thus hull was much stronger than that of other merchant ships) ship that had a 6-inch gun
We had the soviet "пионеры" (pioneers)
We don't anymore
Yeah, I imagine, aside from the fact that party loyalty was compulsory, Pioneers were probably fun to hang out with
I mean, yeah, of course we have some kind of organized outdoor activities for youth, it's just they pale in comparison with what we had previously
I personally have never even heard specifically of Russian scouts
Look at the numbers: there are a few scout organisations, and most of them have somewhere between 1000-2000 members (with exactly one exception of >10000)
And that's in a country of 145 million people
Unfortunately, scouting isn't that big these days
In Russia there are some places with Roman ruins
I don't want to touch the Crimean peninsula, so I tried to find somewhere else
We have Antic town Tanais near Rostov-on-Don
Also there is Phanagoria (near Sennoy, Krasnodar krai)
To be honest, it's not really Roman ruins, it was Bosporian Kingdom and later, the Kingdom of Pontus
It was connected with Roman world, everyone knows Mithridates the Great
And it was located throw the all Russian coast of Black sea
Near the village Arkhipo-Osipovka (near Gelendzhik, Krasnodar krai) there were found remains of a Roman watchtower
This love song from 90s
[Loneliness is a bitch] and [Someday you] both by Slava
I just love beats in both
Many things are great here but climate is not one of them
Russian women are the most beautiful, that’s a thing a lot of people agree with in Russia
Let’s say slavic women *
Ahahah, love you Belarus
Ehm, not at all
I didn’t say that all of them are beautiful, but it’s definitely not the place where the women are the ugliest
Not sure about this information
I know some people who don’t like it and zoomers are mostly indifferent
English cheese is good
And English pies
And English tea
By that measure most French cheeses aren't French
My East Slav radar works pretty well
I can mistaken a Ukrainian for a Russian, but usually East Slavs are rather easily distinguishable from Western Europeans and Anglo-Saxons
Somewhere during Oktoberfest in Bavaria I met this dude and we recognized we spoke in the same accent so we started a conversation, he was just visiting for the beer from Chelyabinsk and after that I never saw him again
Not from my country but Russian speaker
He asked me to take a picture of him in front of Eiffel Tower then asked if I speak Russian (based on my accent probably)
We went to drink coffee and chat and while ordering barista asked us in Russian: do you want milk
Had a good laugh
For a record: I'm Russian, the guy is Ukrainian and barista from Moldova
Yeah, just yesterday happened with a Russian person lol
Lots of Russian people abroad (including me) socialize with non-Russians a lot so tend to lose our culture and our distinctive accent
Happens a lot
After 5 years living in France I may confirm - it's 99
9% true
In the same time, I met several French people in France who spoked English with me and I didn't realise that they are French until I asked them
Though, to be honest, it's not only French accent is so strong - Russian and German as well for me =)
Why do you switch to English when you talk to each other
Usually, I can spot a person who speaks Russian from their first word but often enough a person is actually Romanian or Polish
The languages are very different yet the small accent similarities are still there
Often enough, visual cues are a great help: you can easily spot Slavs and people from the 'stans'.
The only difficulties I've ever had were people who had Russian as a second language and thus spoke English perfectly
I know what you mean, sometimes I see a girl on Tinder/Badoo that looks East Slavic, then talk, she says she’s from UA/BL/Ru, I look at her photo again and think “yeah, typical [bulbash/hohol/kacap]”.
But, it’s not really reliable
Especially if a person spent some time abroad and has changed from it “pure form”. If you know know what I mean
Do you have brown hair and slightly wide cheekbones
If yes, her radar works fine, you just haven’t realized yet who you really are
I actually can spot people from the stans or other parts of Russia easily, but struggle locating people from St
Petersburg or Moscow
Since these people generally appear more westernized
That happens a lot in Asia
There are relatively many Russians nowadays, especially in China, and when locals see a white dude with brown hair they automatically assume that you're a Russian
Yeah, the people from the regions and the 'stans' are really obvious (sometimes not in a good way, unfortunately) but I guess living in Moscow for 16 years helped me with identifying fellow Muscovites
Nothing wrong with the stans, I personally really like the culture
But it's very easy to tell where they are from just by the expression on their faces
I'm from the stans so yeah, not trying to insult the culture here, it's more of a speech and behaviour patterns I'm talking about :P
It's funny you should mention facial expression - I currently live in a city where a lot of Russians come for holidays, and I like to joke around with my friends that if you see a person who looks both miserable and angry for no reason whatsoever, it's ~~probably~~ always a Russian
The Russian frown never goes away, even after living abroad for many a year
People always think I'm miserable when I'm really not
Ulyanovsk
It is only memorable as a place of birth of Lenin, the city itself is just provincial and boring
If Russian cities are excluded, then Cologne
It is very obvious it was almost destroyed during WW2
The Cologne Cathedral is breathtaking and certainly worth visiting
Fortunately, it's right outside the train station, so you can arrive, visit the cathedral and then leave
I think Moscow
What
Absolutely not
I don't know, this looks fine to me, could be worse
I'm not into nightlife at all; as a tourist, I usually visit cities for architecture, parks, museums
And I haven't been to that many cities outside Russia (maybe like 15, and mostly capitals)
I'm sure there are many cities, but Cologne was one of the most boring cities outside Russia for me so far
Nothing wrong with a pljeskavica
I'm a huge fan of Art Nouveau, so Brussels is on my list
Even if the only thing I will do there is take pictures of Art Nouveau houses lol
Post-soviet countries have the cheapest internet not just in Europe but in the world
A bag of 100 costs like €15 in Moscow
Is it too expensive
Once we were caught by the thunderstorm and heavy rain in the mountains at night
We spent few hours holding tent together and guessing if we are low enough to avoid lightning strike
It was scary at first, but over time it became boring
Just half-sleep, loud bangs, bright flashes and hammering rain which spalled onto my face as a water spray
In other situations i love thunderstorms
But not when they interrupt my sleep
How would you call a kick scooter in polish
In Russian it's Samokat
Planes in Russian are also Samolyot, but car is avtomobil' (I guess we just borrowed this one) or mashina (like machine)
Привет, я Джон. Рад познакомиться. Ты откуда?
Hi, I John
Glad to know you
You where from
I can't really translate "pleasure to meet you" in Russian and back again
So that's the best variant I could think of
Привет, меня зовут Денис. Рад тебя видеть. Откуда ты?
Hello, they call me Denis
Happy you to see
Where from you are
>I can't really translate "pleasure to meet you" in Russian and back again
So that's the best variant I could think of
Приятного познакомиться
Read some classic Russian literature to find out
Jokes aside, the task was to form a sentence in my native language and then translate it into English word for word, right
If that is the case, then I don't understand what the English word Pleasure has to do with anything
In Russian the sentence "Pleasure to meet you" consists of two words "Рад познакомиться". I could translate "Рад" into English as "I am glad" but that would be the whole sentence instead of one word
So I've choose to translate it like "Glad". That was the translation of the first word
Let's move to the second one
One could translate the word "Познакомиться" into English as "to familiarize". But I've chosen to do it differently because in Russian Познакомиться is formed from "Знать" which means "to know".  Познакомиться = to know you
So again it would be a whole sentence instead of one word
Thus, I've decided to translate Russian sentence "Рад познакомиться" (I am glad to know you) as Glad to know
if you really want to stick to "word for word" rule it would be Glad know, but it doesn't really have mach sense
So now you know that in Russian meeting people has nothing to do with pleasure :D
I'm not a native speaker so I expect to be corrected, but I'd thought приятного (which means appropriate/comfortable/polite) was a rough equivalent in this context
Приятного познакомиться is like "it's pleasant to make your acquaintance
Ну, если есть желание пуститься во все тяжкие, то тогда уж "Приятного познокомления"  :D
На да, признаю: опростоволосился чутка. Не так понял задачу: я составил предложение на русском и перевёл на английский, а не английскую фразу перевёл на русский и обратно на английский. Посыпаю голову пеплом и рыдаю крокодиловыми слезами.
А если серьёзно, то... можно же не меня поправлять, а предоставить свой вариант ответа! Хотя, по-моему, только месье особо тонко разбирающийся в извращениях мог поставить такую задачу: с английского туда и обратно. Дословно. Это как-то слишком жутко для меня. Моя бедная русская языка такого не выдержит.
Well I'm outdone, no way I'm going to be able to read all that
My point was that we're literally taught, when studying Russian as a foreign language, that Приятного познакомиться means "nice to meet you" (though maybe "a pleasure to make your acquaintance" is closer) - of course приятно is more like pleasant/appropriate, at least by my understanding, but it certainly seems close enough that I'd feel it's justifiable to say it's an equivalent
Thanks
Cultural exchange at its finest :) Although, I guess i have some advantage here doe to ability to somewhat read Latin letters
I often hear foreigners say that they can not understand Cyrillic at all
There is a Canadian even who thought Cyrillic is some sort of a cipher since it has letters and numbers mixed up together
Like Ч (ch) look a lot like 4 and З (z) looks just like 3
The very reason he started to study Russian
And I guess it's also the reason all Hollywood "Russian" words are always just some jibberish
First of all, I'm sorry, I thought you can speak Russian
My bad
Second, "Приятного познакомиться" is just some nonsense
The phrase you're meaning to say is "Приятно познакомиться" which means "Мне приятно с тобой познакомиться" (I'm pleased to meet you
Third, I admit I've got original task wrong
Forth, If you want to suggest you translation - feel free to post it under the original post
Different people would come up with different translations ether way
There is no need to correct one another
And finally, if you can't understand some of the phrases I've used in my previous comment - ask away
My English isn't particularly good, but I'll do my best to help you
[European viper]
[Siberian tiger]
[Brown bear]
Siberian midge
Even this is an insects - believe me you'd prefer to meet a bear or moose than spent a few hours in a middle of midge swarm
Now you know why there's so many empty lands across Siberia
Also ticks, boars, moose
Yeah, I think nowadays it's not quite accurate
While Russia still declares itself as a semi- presidental republic, Putin accumulated a lot of power in the past 15 years, making Russia effectively a full presidental republic
Haha, no
We fly the Victory Banner instead, since it's VE Day in Russia
And attach cringy stickers to our cars -_-
As opposed to Kingdom of Bulgaria without political parties and the government appointed by the Tsar
I guess it would be better for everyone if they didn't ally with the Nazis, but that was not an option and not up to them to decide sadly
Just like sliding out of Soviet sphere of influence
That's history
Like it or not
Not quite sure what you're trying to tell me
I just mentioned that Bulgaria turned from dictatorship to dictatorship
And they were caught between superpowers who didn't give the right of choice to their satellites
Western (democratic, if you will) model was better than Soviet socialism, but that was far from obvious up until late 70s.
> that was not an option and not up to them to decide sadly
Personal freedom is exactly my point
Bulgaria as well as many other nations, and by nations I mean common people in the first place, were forced into something what they didn't want
No matter if they were democratic or not
> we had to join the Axis or we would have been invaded
Did it work out
'Come and See' by Elem Klimov
If you want to see an anti-war movie, this is one of our best offerings
Брат (Brother)
Absolutely amazing movie, at first it looks like a shitty mafia drama, but it's much more
I've already read the book which was depressing as fuck
I don't know if I can handle a movie version
It is a good representation of what was in Russia in the 90s. The whole country was full of that
Why
Is this supposed to be funny
Can you withstand the temptation of the Monolith
I'm not, I'm not
Just wondering what's the background of the joke
I'm not into it apparently
It doesn't matter
Whoever that would be he/she will immediately lose power and local elites will decide who will be ruling next
In Russian there is also an incredible amount of cuss words, i’m not sure it’s a thing that we can be proud of, but u can use it in 10000 different ways and every word has a different meaning depending on the context
I also find it beautiful, not harsh as a lot of people see it
And i like the fact that it’s considered as one of the most difficult  languages to learn, so it kinda adds a “charm” to it
We also don’t have gender articles, but we have to conjugate EVERYTHING (it sucks) : numbers, names, etc
Let’s take the basic russian name : Ivan - Иван.
Я дам Ивану - i will give to Ivan
Я взял у Ивана - i took something from Ivan
Его зовут Иван - his name is Ivan
Он воспользовался Иваном - he used Ivan
Он плохо отозвался об Иване - he said bar things concerning Ivan
As you see the simple name Иван (Ivan) is always conjugated depending on the context
The last letters always change, and we have this kind of thing also with numbers, cities
etc
Vladimir Mayakovsky wrote this:
“I would have learnt Russian just because of the fact
That it was spoken by Lenin”
I  always use “fair enough” haha (though it’s widely used in Australia, am i right
) Why is it meaningless
Yeah bro, since all bad characters in Hollywood movies are Russians - people think it’s harsh and intimidating
Kind of psychological thing
[Kholodets] (a pork jelly), it is considered distuging by many here as well
So it's like Russian holodets
Meat jelly
Can be very tasty with mustard
Chicken liver and onions is incredible
One my favorite meals
Same here
Went to high school in Norway
Enjoyed it all
But the winter blues crept in and before I knew it I had a form of depression and general lack of energy
Vitamin supplements and  icky fish oil helped
Plus the sun started shining after a few months

Very common, especially when texting, but in speech too
It's mostly used as a question or an affirmation (like in "We'll bang, ok
"; "Ok, I'll buy it then"), but sometimes as an adverb or an adjective meaning "normal", "well", "good" (like in "not very ok")
We usually spell it like ок (*ok*), but sometimes like oкей (*okej*)
In the literary language, о'кей (*o'kej*) is also used
The pronunciation is usually *okej*, but sometimes *ok*.
Horosho is way more common
If that was a man from 1913 he would be asotunded
A man from 1919 would believe anything, that was the low point of our civil war, death and destruction everywhere
"The Poles and Finns are going to humiliate you; the Germans will doublecross you and attempt to wipe you out; the Georgian clerk will be the one to win the leadership contest and the Union you're fighting for will die not with a bang but a whimper in about 70 years time
On the upside, we're happier, healthier and richer now so it all kind of worked out well
If by "modern" you mean the hugest collection of glass dicks inhabited by the hugest dicks in suits, then [Moscow city]

There are 46 settlements with two-letter names, but no one-letter, AFAIK
I only learnt French for three years in school, and still understood at least 60% of all articles
You don't have to be a polyglot to understand what "Mario e un idraulico immaginario" or "Războiul Civil American" articles say
Especially since Portuguese sounds more like drunk Russian than a Romance language
I've never seen it personally, so it's difficult for me to have personal feelings about this building
But as a human, I feel like the humanity loses a part of its culture; it always saddens me when historically significant things are lost
I hope it is restored
I was really hoping that we'd someday put another crown on Lizzy's head in there
I change the way i speak when in german and english
I actually put effort in order to say words, unlike in my mother tongue
I swear in English much more then in Russian, couse for me it's not sound like swearing
You pay a lot more attention to your words when you're speaking another language, like I always find myself thinking for a second before I say a single word to not mess up the grammar rules of German
Because the amount of ways to say "The" in German is really overwhelming :/
Definitely, it's even scientifically proven that a personality shift happens
I think I'm much more lighthearted when I speak Romance languages, while when I speak my native language I'm much more serious
Russian curse words sound a lot harsher, think that the huge amount of rap in English makes cursing feel more acceptable
Possibly Podgorica, capital of Montenegro
Looks like other cities of Montenegro have more entertainment than the capital
Small countries I'm pretty sure don't have this problem since their cities are small in general
We have #1 medal at not knowing foreign language
Eve though we learn english since 2nd grade(as far as i know) noone cares about it and any knowledge they have is despite their attempts to not to learn it
Russian there
Right know there's a common opinion that knowing at least English or Chinese is a must
But not much people actually master or learn them on daily basis
Exactly this
Same as basically everyone else, but I honestly can't imagine a situation where a guest that isn't "close enough" to me would dare to open the fridge themselves, haha
So I see it as more of s hypothetical question
It isn't something that we ever think or or something that parents teach their kids
Yes, if you're not family member or very close friend
But latter is also questionable
I woudn't do it
Yeah, same here
But to be honest I’ve left a “soda” out in the open and It was ice cold the next morning
But it was -30c
Ukraine: Less uptight/more liberal and have good party scene
Georgia: same as ukraine but also very loyal people with great cuisine
Baltics: progressive and innovative people that has helped their economies grow
Mongolia: they never cause any problems, we never hear about them
China: their focus on education
Kazakhstan/Azerbaijan : aslo fiercely loyal and always willing to back it
Finland/Norway: good poltical culture, seem like organized and efficient people
North Korea: n/a but i feel sorry for them
Poland: good cuisine and the right balance of western and slavic values
Salo
I love it
That's why we are now happy we never hear about them :)
They’re pretty much family to us at this point
I hope you're trying to be a troll
I also don't like Magnificent Century series
Yep, "pocket opposition".
Who cares about your sexuality in Russia
I thought Gulash is from South Caucasus cuisine, but quick Google changed it
[The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts]
Never expected to like it
Came out very impressed
In 2013 it was the most modern and thought provoking museum I’ve seen
It's hard to say
All non-native Russian speakers I've met spoke good or excellent Russian, so it was never annoying
I don't know how I'd react to someone having a lower level
I agree with other commenters that other people putting their effort into learning a new language is worthy of respect, but that doesn't always translate into spontaneous reactions
Are the property prices outside these areas tanking
I think we should at least decriminalise it, because in Russia you can be jailed for 7 years for like 3 grams of cannabis
A lot of young students ruin their life
Does anyone count how many times this question has already been asked so far
No, we should look in a long-term how countries that only recently legalized it do
Of course no
As we know all strong addiction comes from marijuana
There isn’t any drug addict who didn’t started use cocaine/heroine
from trying marijuana
You can say that it’s not harm thousand times but I’m sure it is
At first you ingest it, after that you will hang on something stronger
Yes, the drug laws here are completely bogus
You can get hard jail time for a few grams, and people's lives are destroyed over stupid things like this
>Laws are not controlling a society, just offer a reasonable way of living together
You what mate
Laws ARE controlling a society
If you violate laws, you get punished
That's one of the main functions of state: to enforce laws
Everyone not your ethnicity hates you
Idk why I thought this
Nobody told me this
My parents didn't make me think this
I just thought non-Russian people wanted to kill me
I didn't even hate non-Russian people, I just feared them
Of course this xenophobia died quickly within a few months after I grew older than the age of 4, but thinking back on it I was so stupid
I think it was because I grew up in the very northern most region of Siberia, where everyone I knew was the same skin colour as me
I'm just now looking at the actual map of Scandinavia and it's the same size of Alaska wtf
I think you can just pick 5 random capitals and you'll have something to look at in all of them
Lisbon - Côte d’Azur / Paris - London - Moscow(no bias) - Istanbul for me
but I would also say Barcelona, Copenhagen, Budapest
Amsterdam
Podgorica, Minsk, Chishinau, Skopje, can't think of another bland capital
Petersburg is more romantic, cultural, chill
I just prefer Moscow, the city is much more cosmopolitan
I was coming to mention Lavazza
I prefer crema e gusto for the rich taste but qualita oro is equally fantastic
I use a French peas to make it
I enjoy drip coffee too, but I'm too lazy to order a pack of filters online, and they never have filters in physical shops here
But after reading your comment I feel like I have to
Will order in a minute
I dated someone from the UK
It was the happiest five years of my life
I don't really want to talk about our private life, but she was special to me
And she still is
It was
strange, at first, because I don't consider the UK that far away from Russia (northern Europeans tend to have similar traits in my opinion), yet she seemed to consider me about as exotic as a Martian
She was just an easygoing person in general -- whereas I'm decidedly not
Extroverted where I'm quite insular
And definitely my gateway into understanding the UK and British culture
I would've done the same for Russia, but we never got around to it
My foster parents, bless them, accept me but they're still not very comfortable with my inclinations
I absolutely didn't enjoy meeting her parents because I made loads of missteps
I stood there like an idiot for a few minutes at the front door waiting for them to tell me where to go; I took my shoes off as leaving them on here is a no-no; I gave my honest opinion on something that was cooked when I asked for it (which her mother didn't like) etc
Those ones didn't.
Not very creepy in a terms of mysteries but there's a number of semi-abandoned fields in Omsk region and around North-Western Siberia where people buried a cattle infected with anthrax - cows, pigs and pangolins
It's one of these places where you will not want to walk or even approach
You can watch Alien: Covenant - it will be enough to understand what awaits you on these fields
а, в, и, к, о, с, у, я. Eight
Э may somehwat a word as well

В - in
И - and
К - to, towards
О - about
С - with
У - at, nearby
The same but we use *iz* instead of *z*.
Same (except "from" is "s" if its from a surface and "iz" if it's from the inside of something)
Also б may be used like shortened бы
Relevant meme [ (yep, these in the middle are legit sentences)
Let's not forget that English is actually three languages pretending to be one
Many Russians say "вышел с дома", "пришел со школы", etc
, especially in the South (where their language has some Ukrainian features)
But school teachers say it's "bad grammar".
It's like that in most other Slavic languages as well, or something similar
Yeah, I know, it's a well-known joke
Most languages in the world have been influenced by other
Russian had аз too once but now it's an ancient/obsolete word which you see mostly in quotes
Like мне отмщенье и аз воздам from Bible
That's because Old Bulgarian and Church Slavonic were closely related, almost same language at some point
And Russian was highly influenced by Church Slavonic
I once redacted some Bulgarian subtitles to a Russian movie (making them into Russian subtitles for learners)
And at first Bulgarian seemed unintelligible but after two hours I suddenly noticed that I understand a lot but feel like I'm reading text in some strange old Russian
I guess, it must be easier for a Russian person (with some exposure to old texts) to learn Bulgarian than vice versa though, because modern Bulgarian has lots of words old Russian had too but modern Russian lost many words that were similar to Bulgarian once
Yeah, it's interesting how vocative was exactly the case that Russian lost with time while keeping all others
And Bulgarian is so close lexically but grammar changed so much
If I'm not wrong, Bulgarian is the only Slavic language that has articles
Russian has lost the old vocative, but relatively recently gained the new vocative, though it has a very limited use, I mean name forms like Вань, Маш, Лёш, Вов etc
Yes, I would say
Most people are very reluctant to talk about their income or the value of expensive purchases such as cars or homes
Or how much they pay on loans
As for me, I always found this silly especially between colleagues
Next to my workplace, I always hang out a payment receipt issued to me
There wrote my month salary, my year salary and total taxes I paid
I didn't stole this money so nothing to hide
But when I talk to relatives of friends from provinces where people get much less than me for me it's always awkward
And I'm trying to downplay my income
These people get 10-15k rubles when I get 40-50k for the same job
In Russia it's not and people tend to share this info in first hours of acquaintance
It's rude to show off and bragging if you make more than someone
If you colleagues and know each other not by one day
I mean it's good to exchange this information more benefits then loss
This is kinda unreasonable because it's better to know your market value and know that you under/overpaid than not knowing anything at all
But it's my mercantile point of view
Are you located in Moscow, since here it's a common thing to openly share it especially as I found within middle asian community working there
Yep, not far from Default city
Even though your politics are a shit show, it is refreshing to see a post soviet state with relatively fair and free elections
Hopefully we follow suit in Russia
Generally yes, but that also depends on how protective your parents are
My grandparents didn't let me leave the neighbourhood on my own (let's say 1km in any direction from home) until I was about 10, but most of my classmates and friends would take public transport or walk wherever needed by themselves, and it was never a problem
I mean, our cities are pretty walkable, public transport functioning, and the environment relatively safe (shit might happen, but you don't expect it to happen because it usually doesn't)
This isn't exclusively a Polish thing
It's the same in Russian (and in Czech, as far as I know)
I often see other Russians use "adequate" instead of "sensible", "reasonable" or "sane" because that's what "адекватный" means in Russian
There are many more, but this one grabs my attention the most
edit: how could I forget about this one
Using "news" and "money" as plural nouns since they're plural in Russian
And in Russian
Damn dude how does one even end up knowing how to explain all of that in English lol
I am a rather fluent English speaker and I have no idea what “transitive verb” or “reflexive pronoun” mean
Also, is an average Ukrainian fluent in Russian
> There are many more
Oh, yes
- "to be agree" instead of "to agree"
- "on the street" instead of "in the street"
- "to drive/ride on a car/bus/train" instead of "to go by car/bus/train"
- "say/tell", "do/make", "hand/arm" and "leg/foot" confusion
- "tell/call/help to someone", because they all take dative in Russian, like "talk"
- "give to me the book"
I don’t understand it
Can someone explain what sound you guys are talking about
Or are you talking about spelling errors and not about pronunciation
Do they moor their jakht at the kway

There are dozens of other languages besides Russian which don’t use the verb to be the way English does so I have no idea what you are talk about about
I actually don't see this one, although it's something beginning learners of English would struggle with
> "on the street" instead of "in the street"
Actually, both ways are acceptable
Brits prefer "in" and Americans "on". Not sure about any regional differences in those two or other English speaking countries
That's because he has a wrrridiculouse French accente
I was on vacation in Germany and tried to use my German to order lunch in a café inside Leipzig Hbf
The waitress took my order, answering my questions in German, until she finally said "Thank you, I'll be back with your drinks shortly" in Russian and left before I could react

We have an internal passport [yes a passport]
You are required to have a domestic passport with your personal data and a photo of yourself once you turn 14
It's the only form of ID that is accepted "officially" (like when you register a bank account, apply for a government service or whatever)
Russian passports are also accepted in a few countries like Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, etc
If you're travelling to any other country, you need to get an international passport
Unlike many ID cards, it has no record of your height or eye colour, but has a marriage stamp, a permanent residence stamp and stamps for your travel passports
Thanks
Too lazy
Also your army records
Moscow, Moscow, Moscow, St
Petersburg, Moscow
no surprises here
Probably: Moscow, Moscow, St
Petersburg, St
Petersburg, Moscow
Moscow, founded in 1147, became a capital of Rus' much later due to absence of unified Russia until 15-16 centuries and after defeating Tver' in this status
Petersburg was founded in 1703 by Peter the Great and soon became a capital, in 1800 it had about 330k people while Moscow had 270k. In 1900, these numbers grew to over a million, but St
Petersburg still was bigger
After revolution, Moscow became a capital again
Soon it became the biggest city again
During Putin terms, Moscow absorbed some cities nearby, and right now it has well over 10 million people, easily a record for Europe
I actually expected St Pete to have overtaken Moscow by 1800
Well, the difference was actually about 30k in 1800, according to wiki
And in 1810, St
Petersburg was already the largest by far

I've been to Oulu twice for some workshops and academic exchanges
It's a quiet little city, and it was in March, so I was excited to take some photos of aurora borealis

Not weird
Just a wasted opportunity, that's all
Can you tell Estonians and Russians apart
On my trip to Estonia, I was told that I should speak Russian to Russians and English to Estonians and that I should be able to distinguish them by their looks
You know what, all of them looked broadly European and could equally be Russian or not Russian
I've got not clue how I was supposed to differentiate between them
Lol
I see what you mean
I wouldn't say the majority of women dress like that here, but definitely many of them
Except the Orthodox cross, which I don't think many people ever wear
Thanks for enlightening me
Same in Russia: не делай из мухи слона
Same in Russia
We have the Institute of Russian Language
It doesn't ensure the stability of the language though
On the contrary it tries to keep all the rules as up to date with the "real" spoken and written Russian as possible
It is also the institution that keeps track of all the new words and chooses the word of the year thing
Sometimes these guys even suggest major updates for the rules, mostly for making them easier, but those amendments to the textbooks usually aren't passed
Also, we have gramota
ru website, where it's possible to see whether you use the word correctly :) There are even the forums where philologists can answer your questions about the language :)

No, afaik they never do that when dubbing to Russian
It was very confusing to watch 'Friends' where they made fun of Emily's English accent or 'House MD' with Australian accent of Chase
But in the remakes they sometimes use Ukrainian or Caucasian accents for 'the others'
USSR unified the language, destroying every single dialect
>In The Netherlands almost every village/town has its own dialect of Dutch
You are a piece of plain the size of Moscow oblast', HOW
Well we actually have a barely visible example
You can hear the difference between Moscow and St
Petersburg speech some letters aren't pronounced like it should be and the use of words can vary
Also we have the mix-ups of South languages with Russian which adepts you can easily find in European part of Russia
Kind of
Most people had to move to some obscure region after graduating university in Moscow or central Russia, so that already would homogenise the language
Teachers had to relocate too, so at school people with regional dialects would be punished for speaking improperly
And of course radio and TV were Moscow dialect only
>So, all of this is a lie
He probably means how it is in real life, nowadays it's hard to find people speaking in a particular dialect, unless one looks for older people in some villages I guess
There are some stereotypical differences in pronunciation of certain letters in Southern Russia, but even those differences are disappearing in the younger generation
Russians have a very prescriptivist attitude towards the Russian language, ideas on what is the correct version of Russian are quite set by now
Yes, though these regions never had time to develop dialects in the first place
>we have dialects that some of us can't even understand
~~we call that byelorussian and ukrainian~~
Those should be separate languages at this point, shouldn't they
Macedonia is pretty mountainous tho, and mountains are good at protecting languages and dialects (and cultures too btw) from being assimilated - just look at the Caucuses
A fuck ton of languages and even more ethnicities
I remember watching a documentary about an Old Believer village in the Tuva Republic and even in their case they barely have something that could be really called a different dialect
Those people shouldn't have been affected by 20th century population movements
Also no TV or Internet to even out the differences
Obviously most of Russian leaders weren't ethnic Russians: all Russian emperors since Catherine the Second were German and Danish, Lenin was Chuvash, Stalin was Georgian, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Chernenko, Gorbachev - Ukrainian, Andropov - Jewish, Putin - Finnish
Only Yeltsin and Medvedev were 100% Russian
>Putin - Finnish
Are you
TBH, most of my post is a meme)
Well, we have Astronomy as a subject for some time
We have history of art in Russia and drawing in Russia - drawing on 1-6 years and history in 9-11 years of studying
We do have something like slyod here
It is called труд (labor)
We were taught how to use tools by making small crafts
In my school we made wooden racecars and small hammers
AFAIK, only two such places for a really long border: [Ivangorod] on Estonian border, divided by Narva river and [Chertkovo] on Ukrainian border, with border roughly along the railway tracks
There's also the other, Russian, Donetsk, which is across the border from Izvarino
Well, as Russian I do experience it often
Especially with world war II
Most Americans care for the west front only, forgetting that the east front was even more important
And here the American part is diminished too
It's basically not true, but politics and propaganda do it's a job
Not sure about the European side of things
I think both were equally important
You just tried to take the land we took back
I can't blame you for that
But let's be real, you tried being sneaky with the peace terms
Until we told you to do it properly or the deal was off, you made no attempt to attack the retreating Germans until Tornio
Oh, my friend, you just mentioned the thing that has been provoking vigorous debates in Russian historical science since the 18th century
To start with, I would bring some context real quick
So in the 18th century Russian science was on a rise, especially because there were a lot of German, Dutch and Italian scientists invited here by Peter the Great
And there was one german historian, Miller, who was ordered to research Russian Primary Chronicle
And it says that  slavs from Novgorod and some other tribes invited Rurik "to rule them" form the overseas
Having calculated 2+2, Miller concluded that they invited a viking prince from the other shore of Baltics (most agree on "swedish", but I don't know if it was sweden back in 862 already or not, so I wouldn't dare to call it so yet)
Everything would have been great, but at the time Miller researched it, in Russia memories from the Great Northern war with Sweden were really fresh and, you know, his opinion wasn't popular
There was a prominent Russian scientist (though not exactly a historian), Michael Lomonosov, who debated Miller and brought arguments against his position
Lomonosov was a great scientist, but in this debate his main argument was equal to "I don't like swedes, so let's find other theories"
And that "finding" process is continuing today
This is called "Norman question" in Russian historiography
Anti-normanists (who support Lomonosov) usually bring arguments which are quite easily destroyed by Normanists (who don't support Lomonosov) but the debate continues today
Most historians, though, support the Norman theory and agree that Rurik was Swedish (or Scandinavian at least)
Some say that he was the same person with Rorik of Jutland
That, on the other hand, was a very useful debate for Russian historiography because it made historians discover many facts about our history while searching for arguments both for and against
Yeah, you are right
But I think educated people - no matter where they are from, knows and remembers history
I do remember pacific because I have studied history
You are welcome
>  but it gets better with the younger generation
I have some bad news
The youngest generations are the most stalinist generations around
Is that a thing
Well the European part of Russia was invaded, my grandparents fought, and my town has multi-thousands of casualties
(pretty small town), and I remember it just for this fact alone
I'm not angry at the German nation (some stupid people still do), it's just a history, but it touched personally a lot of people here
Yes
I have these weird things called 'pyjamas
I just wear boxers and sleep
Soviet Anthem
I unironically enjoy listening to Blacks and Tans
We deserve the shit you give us
I know about a Polish song called "Let's beat the Muscovites(?) " or something like that
Well we have one which can be translated "Our cossacks ride across Berlin".
In hoi4 - anyone who can manage just fine without a navy, so everyone except Japan and the UK
In Vic2 - Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy and Austria-Hungary, tho i play with mods a lot recently
In EU4 I really ever played only France and Muscovy
Never got around to play any CK game tho
Basically, any European or Middle Eastern country
I just know history of these two regions better that of others and it makes it more interesting to play there
I had plans for few months of vacation in Asia this summer after graduation, which I could use to work on my photography gig, try something creative like science video essays, and look for a place to settle in the future
Luckily, the AirBnb apartment I bought in Bangkok got refunded, so I didn't lose anything
Now my thesis defence got postponed too, so it seems like I will spend most of the summer at home in Moscow

How about a millistate
3 orders of magnitude should suffice for that difference I'd imagine
Not exactly, Russia is just a state
It's the smaller countries like Germany and France are decistates and even smaller ones like Netherlands are centistates
That is by the area and taking Luxembourg as a millistate
I admire Iran's bravery in fighting the biggest military power on Earth that killed more people in recent history than any other country
Few would dare to stand against US without nukes
To be fair, the embassy "attack" happened after the US murdered more than 10 Iraqi soldiers
Edit: typo
Russia
I was expecting Russia to be a popular answer and I wasn't disappointed
In our case, probably China
In the future, I could imagine them looking at Siberia and being tempted by the wide open space and natural resources there
The US isn't going to invade -- it's just not worth it to them
Hard to imagine
I don't think it will be European nation though
They have money and don't have guns - why would they do that
But Asian nations, for example, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India - they might be interested in our territories and resources because of their environmental problems, overpopulation, and being too far away from Europe
Can't imagine anyone invading Russia, that would be suicidal
I'd assume that it's the US, and that the WW3 has just begun
Belarus sure looking shady
Liechtenstein
I will give unusual answer:Turkey
Because of Syria who knows what can happen,because we support the side who opposes Turkey and we have ultimately conflicting interests in some areas and sharing the border there,last time our jet was downed we had sanctions and threats on our TV,furthermore there is Armenia and if Azerbaijan and them will have a conflict then it means that Turkey will join which means there is a possibility of clashes between us and turkish soldiers
Switzerland
I think civil war or riots are more likely to happen than invasion at this point
My Russia or your Russia
Thousand Years Of Beautiful Tradition :)
"Russians are the best villains since Nazis". Just wondering how this is not getting old
>I was expecting Russia to be a popular answer and I wasn't disappointed
Are you sure you're proud of that
Standing at the border, breathing heavily and jerking off looking at Lithuania
Oh yeah
You're the sweetest piece of cake
Who would refuse
Invading Russia would definitely be a suicidal act, maybe not just for the invading country but for the whole world as well
Egh
you're on thin ice
Like super crazy
I'm juggling with arm grenades right now
Why's that
Because we can fight back
Dude, the are the worst

He and his oligarch friends make too much money robbing the state companies of the profits
Ooh, might read that

Who said I was proud of it
That's what you said last time
We all know what happened then
How Germany invaded USSR
Joke
Austria
Hey, you could join us in the old Russo-Danish tradition of screwing over the Swedes)
Oh yeah, how could I forget something that happening in front of my own eyes
Thank you for this reminder
I was talking about our "theatrical character", our friquent representation in media and movies, the popular opinion about us
We're playing villains since the cold war, for over 70 years now
Imagine that
Being hated for 70 years
Always outcasts
Not saying this is something we shouldn't blame our politicians for
It is
But damn that's interesting how Germans escaped this stigma after starting two outstandingly horrible wars in a row
How Italians are clean and fresh after the black shirts
How Japan is super cool after what they did to Chinese people
But we're preserving this trademark no matter what
And this is something I'm wondering about
>I wasn't disappointed
You
We're free with our sexual preferences, right
Most important Lithuania is over 18yo
I think France more experienced in that shit
Those are legitimate representation of our daily life indeed
To be fair, we have a great history of being invaded too
Dude, I'm on this comment section for a whole day and the word "invasion" is appearing in every single answer I'm getting
Come on
Not the ugliest proposal ever
Some common sense in it even
Like what
Do explain to me how it would help Putin's position selling the richest part of the entire federation to a country which still hasn't forgiven us for our part in the Euro colonialist conquests of Chinese territory
One of Putin's policy planks is nationalism
It's not gonna go over well explaining why we sold Siberia to the Chinese
And Putin always makes decisions without a long term strategy -- it's nothing new
That doesn't necessarily mean I'm proud of it
It means I had an expectation and it was fulfilled
Touché.
One happy peaceful boy attacking another happy peaceful boy
It's not "going", nobody is going to invade Russia
It's about "what if". And ok, maybe Afghanisntan is least likely in comparison to other central-Asian nations

You're not awfully aware of Soviet foreign policy toward the Baltic states in the late 30s and early 40s are you
I thought it was pretty obvious but apparently not
- *sad face* •
You're just arguing semantics
Keeping the current pace we're never getting too far, so no worries about the combination you described
It was, don't sweat it
Someone just wanted to doebatsya
Sorry, I *disappointed* you
And btw it was obvious but sounded strange ^((to me))
Obviously you can do whatever you like
However this is nothing more than childish game of pointing fingers
Over and over we hear those "not in Russia though" and "true but not for Russians". I know you're hating the whole concept of this country
But can you try, just for a change, not extrapolate the whole concept on every random Russian you're communicating with
Thank you
Essentially we told the Baltics, "Hey, you need protection and workers
We'll give 'em to you
" Naturally they replied: "Nah thanks, we're good
" Then we replied: "No really, you need protection and our workforce
Let them in now or there'll be problems
So they did, then we overthrew their parliaments; ran fake elections that returned massive majorities in favor of joining the Union and annexed them
Even today all three have problems with their Russian minorities who don't cooperate very well
I'll be more careful in future)
Is there a bar mleczny named Krowa
No, rzywa is hard to understand
Rye cow
Neighing cow
Live cow
Or is there some kind of complicated pun with the sound of a blood-cow
Not really my own
But I know a Ukrainian folk song that's catchy as hell, it's "Хай живе вiльна Украïна"
The only one of my own I can think of right now is "Сумецкая" by Отава Ё
In Russian, it's "Шпаргалка" (Shpargalka)
As far as I know, it doesn't have any other meaning
Although, another way to say it is "Шпора" (Shpora), which also means a spur
Same here
Also "shpora", which is short for "shpargalka".
No lockers for books
We have lockers for our upper clothes and shoes, which we change when entering schools (they get dirty in winter or autumn or spring because of the snow outside, so it is unacceptable to wear them inside)
But how do you do your homework without the books
Isn't that, like, the same in effect
Let's say you have a biology class today
This means you get homework so you have to take the textbook home and bring it back
If you didn't have a locker you would take the textbook to school and bring it back
Same number of trips
We got homework every day
Russia usually uses the short system (that is, 10 in 12th power is trillion, not billion), with an exception being 10 in 9th power called milliard instead of billion — I don't know why
Almost the same as in English
million -> миллион (*million*)
billion -> миллиард (*milliard*)
trillion -> триллион (*trillion*)
quadrillion -> квадриллион (*kvadrillion*)
Moscow supposedly has a [second metro system] used for military and strategic purposes
Supposedly it's connected to an "underground city" that can keep up to 15000 people in case of an emergency
Its existence isn't confirmed officially, so you can't go there
Conspiracy theorists love the Metro-2
Besides that, there are a number of smaller tunnel networks that are proven to exist, including former strategic facilities and underground rivers that were enclosed in a system of tubes (Moscow has a lot of them)
You can even hire a tour guide to walk you through some of them
My friend has done it
Ofc it exists

Maybe something else, but i'm too lazy to think

* Official streams of esports tournaments are not a proper platform for political statements
The player should be punished somehow
* The punishment of the player is, frankly, disproportionate
The only reason I can see for such a harsh punishment is appeasing China
Cannot imagine such a reaction to a different political statement
* Casters being fired for that is ridiculous
Overall, not enough for me to boycott Blizzard, but they've handled it poorly
While I agree, that e-sport should not be a platform for political statements, what Blizzard did was, IMO, an overkill
"There is a person - there is a problem
There is no person - there is no problem" - is not the right way to do damage control
So, fuck them
If you've been playing overwatch instead of TF2 uninstall yourself
That's why they were so harsh in their reaction
The guy put them in a bind and they wanted to dissuade any future attempts like this one
It looks like a "no political agenda of any kind on our platform or else", which is entirely within their rights and, money-wise, distancing from any political statement is the most reasonable course of action for them imo
Has nothing to do with the flair, it's a pretty basic principle for professional sport
I don't think the rule prohibiting political messages has been abandoned by the IOC since then
Czechia, because its borders follow natural borders
Island nations are filthy cheaters
it reaches north pole
Please do
Look how neat New Guinea looks with its straight meridional border
I'm surprised people here are surprised by Turkey's action and Western "non-action". Turkey together with other its NATO and gulf allies has been destabilizing Syria for the last 7 years with one clear purpose: to destroy Syria as a country
So the current invasion is just a logical continuation of that: now there is no one to stop Turkey from de facto annexing yet another piece of land, like they did in Cyprus some years ago
If Russia and the US are allowed to invade other countries, why Turkey isn't?
So what other countries did in 2014 when Russia started the war in Donbass or in 2003 when the US and its allies invaded Iraq
The problem is that there are no universal rules to prevent wars
A person who makes the decision to start a war should be tried in an international tribunal with no exceptions, maybe this can bring more peace into the world
edit:grammar
Tell that to Americans, Brits and French
Yes, it's absolutely possible most of the time
On several occasions, I've identified native Russian speakers based on their intonation, even though I couldn't spot any non-native traits in their pronunciation or grammar or word choice (that doesn't mean there weren't any, though)
What the hell is perfect English pronunciation anyway
English/Scottish/Irish accent is as noticeable to me as an Italian or Russian (with latter ones I actually have better chances of understanding what's being said amusingly)
Even American accents, more subtle (NY, midwest) or less subtle (bible belt) are very distinct
Of course, some work on and fewer succeed in completely eradicating their accent, however, I think by that point they should be considered on the equal terms with native speakers
If I understand correctly that shining means excellent, this translation would actually work in Russian
Does using "fewer" with countable nouns sound pretentious to native speakers
No, we throw away our skates or glue our flippers together
Or play a game of crate
And people who swallow dust are losers
Our culture is mostly based on survivalism
Most history was a hungry blood bath for us with 20 century at its peak
Now we can live in very harsh conditions and think everybody is an enemy
Wash times, damn
Why can't you have washing machines inside your apartments already, could you please remind
This is ridiculous, right
Yeah poles are very simmilar
Can't think of a single one
We're really diverse, but for every unusual region I can think of another one that's kinda similar
Okay, let it be Kalmykija
I guess it's true for capital cities in most countries
Take Paris, Moscow, Vienna, Prague, etc
Not sure if flattered or offended haha
But I guess we are somewhat distinct in some ways
Dagestan exists and has more in common with Chechnya than, say, Tambov
Chechnya is the most obvious choice
Russia is homophobic in general and especially in the montane republics, one wouldn't want to come out in Dagestan either
That guy was an outlier
Overall we are pretty lowkey (or at least I thought so)
It's 100% regular Russia
> Slavic
I would've expected the second language to be Hungarian
From the UK: [Jason Mraz]
From Russia: [Monetochka]
Can the entirety of Russia ba classified as a weird/bizarre government agency
Also, probably the RosGuard
That’s our riot police/gendarmerie
Ukrainian is awesome
Our anthem uses the same instrumental as the USSR anthem, and while I'm not a super patriot I do like opera so it's okay
Do you guys get apples
Four or five
Maybe six when they are in season
Multiple greens , reds , yellows
Some are big , some are small, all varies with variety of apple
But we have a lot of types of em
I think it’s like 5-6 types
Depends on the season and the store
Mine usually has 3-6
Kinda similar here
It’s usually sour “seasonal” green/red apples, sour Granny Smith and sweet Golden
A chinaware set from East Germany that has never been used because no occasion is special enough
The set is usually kleinbürgerlich as fuck, with gilding and pastoral miniatures on every cup
We don't call sweet peppers Bulgarian peppers in Russia for nothing
You really love them, don't you
>this thing over the kitchen sink (no idea how to call it, it's for wet dishes to dry easily)
we have that thing too, i think it's pretty common here
Every country in the world does that
Except Denmark itself, probably
In Russian we call it "Pshikalka" , "Pshik" is the sound, and "alka" defines it as an object
People around the world can sometimes have strange things in common, it's beautiful
In Russian самоход is kinda obsolete 19-centurish word for every mechanism that moves on its own, heh
Most will imagine some giant robot or hybride tank probably
Why not racija
Minibeasts sounds like a line of plastic toys they try to peddle with an X-TREME sounding ad during a break in a kids' programme
In Russian it's "fireshooting weapon"
We do have a neutral gender
So we randomly attribute one of *three* genders to every word and not two like you do
Btw, in Latin it worked like this too
What gender the word will have mostly depends on endings (ends on -a - must be feminine etc) and general paradigma + tradition
A lot of English textbooks teach kids to use the word "keen
" That's something my grandpa would say
Books also usually teach the BrEnglish word for AmEnglish "drug stores" as being "chemist's," while that's true, a lot of people really do just say "pharmacy" nowadays
I think it flies in America too
Then there's reported speech, which I'm not sure many natives would ever use properly
E.g. You meet an old friend in the street and he says "I'm working as a teacher now
" When you get home to your mother you tell her what happened - "I met Soandso and he said he was working as a teacher
" *My* reaction on hearing that would be "Oh
What happened
Did he get fired
Finally, of course, outdated idioms; "it's raining cats and dogs" is so old that my tour guide in North Korea even used it
I must apologise, though, because past perfect is something we actually *do* use
My advice on articles for speakers of Slavic languages is just not to bother
Embrace the Tarzan speech and just rid yourselves of the stress
Funnily we have it too but most people don't realise it
They just use it unconsciously but don't realise that it's a thing
Just some variations sound better and some sound completely strange
Exactly the same, большой красный мяч (big red ball) is perfectly okay and красный большой мяч (red big ball) is strange and gives away a foreigner
Some characteristics are switchable and some create weirdness if you switch them
Really
I'd always thought we just have some words, generally for organisations, where the correct auxiliary verb is ambiguous
But this is totally a case of me "feeling it out
E.g. "the police is investigating" obviously feels wrong
But "Apple is developing"/"Apple are developing;" totally ambiguous to me
The government is incompetent/the government are incompetent
again I want "is
Fuck, maybe you're right
Germans and Russians both do this because *how* is the correct word in their respective languages
I wonder if English is actually the strange one here
I mean "say" is a verb
so "how you say something" arguably has logic behind it
Though I guess that, to us English, "how you say something" is more about tone/delivery rather than the content
I can't stop myself from using clauses within any sentence I write
E.g. "I helped my uncle, Jack, off the horse
Feels necessary in that one, though ;)
What about those retards who say "Legos," amirite
What native English speakers would ever do that
Did is also often mixed up with "made
" In Russian, at least, it's the same word
I think they're into you ;)
> "I met Soandso and he said he was working as a teacher
" My reaction on hearing that would be "Oh
What happened
Did he get fired
If he did get fired, should I have said "I met Soandso and he said he had been working as a teacher
" in proper reported speech
It ticks me off that "have" has confusing homonyms
whoever designed our language deserves a slap
Whenever I use any complicated tenses in my speech there's always one student who mistakes a "had" in it for a possessive of some kind
Or the opposite kind of situation can happen
And it's *really* difficult to explain the difference
Anyone ever hear this one
James, while John had had "Had," had had "Had Had," "Had Had" had had a better effect on the teacher
You're supposed to pose it to people without punctuation or capital letters as a sort of brain teaser
the idea is that two students were given two different essay topics
I speak Russian but have never learned punctuation
the comma use just seems random to me
What I really dislike is when Russians will write me in English on WhatsApp and start their messages with "Dear, BenedickCabbagepatch
Why on Earth would the comma be after "dear" and not my name
Screw the poor, but tenderly
The general rules of separating direct address from the rest of the sentence with a comma are, I believe, the same both in Russian and English
So even in Russian, it is wrong to put a comma after an adjective in that particular case
No, not at all
I remember actual fights in our Duma
Getting busy with it
Oh, I've just remembered the godawful word for having sex, which some of my elderly relatives use
СЕКСОВАТЬСЯ.
Ugh, the cringe
I think there’s a polandball comic strip hidden somewhere in here
Something something “makings of sex” and a couple of potato jokes
Extremely common in sweet pastries
It was my grandmother who told me about them as a source of drugs when I was about 15
I think we only have yellow press for tabloids, but nothing for literary genres
Well, we call noir noir, but literally "nuar"  not "ćornaja".
We had something similar, but I don't remember how we called it
I would certainly change the Frebruary revolution
It happened in 1917 and its result was abolishing the monarchy and establishing a republic
While some might say that it sounds good, it brought a lot of instability and eventually opened a door for the Bolsheviks to seize power, then the Civil war started because of that and, finally, the USSR was established, which is not a nice thing
Alternatively, the Russian empire was not the most cruel state and its industry was rapidly developing by the year 1913 so it would have been very possible that if it had survived the war, it would have continued that development
Finally, if the communists in Russia had not started those massive repressions and aggression towards other countries, as well as if they had not been supporting communists all over the world, then, maybe the NSDAP wouldn't have gained that much support in Germany because one of the main reasons for their victory, alongside the revanchist sentiment of the population was the fact that the nazis positioned themselves as anti-communist and many voted for them, for they feared getting their own version of the USSR
You did have a major impact on Barbarossa
You ensured it started later in the year, and so ensured that winter came before they could complete all their objectives
It's called the Time of Troubles in English
Translation of the Russian term for the time
Taming wild expanses
Cossacks
Not the ones from the Dnieper (which contemporary Russians called Circassians), but the ones from the Don
The Tsars kept splitting off new hosts off them, sending them as armed colonists to the frontiers of the empire
They weren't loners as stereotyped cowboys were, though
Do Poles have cossack stories
There are plenty of those in Russia, but Poland controlled cossack lands as well, so i wonder if there is a cossack archtype in Polish literature
Yeah, cossacks lived in big organized communities but were otherwise quite similar to cowboys (stereotypically religious, socially conservative, freedom-loving frontiersmen with horses and guns)
It was a conference where the sides decided what the future of Europe would be
Of course, Stalin was insisting in expanding his sphere of influence on a lion's share of countries that were liberated from Germany, but who else wouldn't in his position
I am glad that not every country in Europe became socialist, though
Well, in Russia government states that conference as a moment of glory and somewhat we’re should be proud of
The fact it happened in Russian land is seen as a significant demonstration of power
Also this is one of the reasons why Russian government (aged 65+ KGB officers) wanted to return Crimea and decided to use their chance in 2014
Well, it is mentioned in history books as prelude to the Cold war
I doubt people outside of history nerds know anything about the event or have any attitude towards it
Tried that, doesn't work, any other tips
But wouldn't family planning and birth control even further lower our birth rates
You know our population is declining already, right
(Russia) Vodka, and it tastes like sharpies to me, it smells really good, but it burns when it goes down my throat
It's easy to learn the basics of English and start using simple sentences from the very beginning
It wouldn't be so easy if you tried learning a highly inflected language (such as most Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages)
If you aim at a near-native level of fluency, then it's gonna be hard as fuck but not harder than many other languages
Some English speakers (or speakers of any other popular language for that matter) like to think that their language is superior because there are so many idioms and ways to say the same thing
Those who say that have obviously never learned any other language
Otherwise they would know that English is no special in this regard
English dictionaries may contain more words than dictionaries of other languages, but does an average native speaker really know those 500000 words, or at least 50000
Besides that, what counts as a separate word
Which words make it into a dictionary and which don't? The last question is relevant to linguistically prescriptivist societies (such as Russia) where slang and informal words are often considered inappropriate to be in a dictionary
English is a nightmare
All the conjunctions and slang is just overwhelming
Also it's annoying how it's not technically correct to start a sentence with 'And' but I don't really acknowledge or care
> On another note, I believe these weird dick-measuring contests over whose language is harder are stupid and pointless
There are no more complex or simple languages in terms of expressiveness
If a language lacks grammatical cases, it makes use of prepositions and word order
If it doesn't have tenses, it may rely on adverbs and aspectual distinction etc
I have to admit that make use of it every now and then
It is easier to start learning it for a European, but it doesn't make its structure or expressiveness more complex or simple
We Europeans take many "simple" things in English for granted
When many (or even most
) Asian languages don't have verb tenses, plural numbers, rigid word order, etc
Imperial units
Baseball and american football
Yeah, in Russia people would just get a shot of vodka and carry on
AFAIK metric system is official in UK
What system do you use in daily life
What's the difference between ethnicity and race
Some names for Russian cities are different in English
For example, St
Petersburg is actually Sankt-Peterburg (so basically it was anglicised in English), Moscow is Moskva
But most cities are actually called the same
There are probably more cases when English and Russian names of foreign cities are different, and similarly to Russian cities, it mostly affects big famous cities: Rome = Rim (read "reem"), Paris = Parizh (read as French pronunciation but with "zh" in the end), New Orleans = Novyy Orlean (word for "new" was translated into Russian), Beijing = Pekin (AFAIR this city used to be called Peking in English and many other languages, but then English spelling of Chinese words changed or something)
Beijing - Pekin
Pyongyang -Phen’yan
Rome - Rim
Paris - Parizh
It's Pekin in Russian as well
Shots fired
We have Yandex
Maps that also serve as a public transport journey planner in most Russian cities
In my experience, they tend to be more detailed than google in Russia
They are part of Yandex, which started as a search engine (I don't know anyone who uses it nowadays) but now has all sorts of services like Yandex
Delivery, Yandex
Taxi, Yandex
Music, etc
These are usually grouped under the umbrella term of Yandex
Shit (Яндекс.Хуйня) because there are so many of them
Everyone I know uses Google
We also have Yandex, Mail@ru and Rambler, but I haven't seen them used as search engines for years
I use Yandex on mobile because of Alisa
On my opinion, it is the best voice assistant
That's why I have only one browser and therefore the search engine
Also, I must admin that the searching movies in yandex is some next level
I actually use it too, but that's the only way I can think of
Fair enough, should probably try it
1 RUB - nothing
10 RUB - mediocre ice cream
100 RUB - 1 litre of Juice / 2 Twix/ 1 bottle of milk/ 2 metro or bus tickets
I would say this is a very bad ice cream
Not safe for health haha
We learned cursive
A useless skill
In Russia cursive is popular but only in Russian language we call it text written by hand/handwritten "от руки или рукописный" because it's in default means cursive
This is like unspoken standard dunno any notation to law but people mostly from preschool learn how to write cursively aka just chain characters in the words
I stopped doing this at 9th grade and did mix-ups of printed-like and cursive
Funny fact
While study of nation language we actively in the writing of cursive like texts
On English lessons we are do printed one because westerners don't give a shit so do teachers are
I guess it will die out at some point as it has in the English speaking countries in the past century
My younger brother hasn't been taught cursive (he's in year 5 iirc)
I don't quite get it when learners of Russian get so hung up on the cursive and how Russians claim that it's an absolutely necessary skill to survive in Russia etc
Havent you seen memes about Russian cursive
Idk why, mb keeping traditions
But this one is stupid
But this thing is useless
If by Че это (what is it) you meant Почему (why), then Im explaining: first, it's usually easier to write printed-like letters and they're more understandable, second there's no cursive on computers so we're still getting use to normal style
Easier to write in print
What
I can't write in print fast, i always switch to cursive even if i don't want to
bc you're used to
Everyone should be used to here, it's the only way you can write in school
If you first get used to printing, then you'll be fine in school
At higher school I was fine writing printed-like letters
Oh, yes, I remember some tourists from Iceland paying an insane amount of money for a taxi during the World Cup
I wonder why they didn't put a warning about unlicensed taxis in the fan guide
Most people here haven never tried octopus, but the idea doesn't get me freaked out
I mean, we eat shrimp and squid, mussels are widely available too, so I guess octopus isn't that much different
I don't eat it very often because fresh octopus is hard to find in Moscow, but I like it
Camions
Like big trucks
Voronezh - should be bombed at any occasion
Omsk - there is no way out
Once you're there, you die
Moscow - sucks blood of the whole Russia
Peterburg - hipsters
Caucauses - sheepfuckers
Chelyabinsk - tough simpletons
Siberia - tough bear fighting snowmans
Sevastopol - more nationalistic than normal Russians
Omsk is our meme city in Russia
Like the Omsk bird, old meme, people say the city is weird
Personally don't know much
Do not try to leave Omsk
The Moscow's unofficial name is Not-Stretchable bc there are bunches of immigrant there
If you want to talk about subtleties of Russian literature of the 19th century find a homeless in Saint-Petersburg and buy him vodka
&#x200B;
Chelyabinsk men are so harsh so they do not drink coffee
They eat it from jars
Chelyabinsk porn is so harsh so it's been forbidden in Germany
Chelyabinsk Satanists are so harsh so Satan is afraid to come to them
And so on
Yes, definitely
It's a developed country, has great career opportunities for me as a physicist, I'm allowed to have a family there
In addition, I already know the language, I have reasonable awareness of the US culture, and the US is quite friendly towards immigrants overall, so dealing with emigration to the US should be easier than with most countries
I don't rule out the possibility that I might move to the US at some point in my life, though I have some other countries higher on my list for various reasons
My wife and I would both like to move to New Hampshire, as part of the Free State Project, but there's no foreseeable way we could pull that off
I'm a great admirer of the US Constitution, unlike most I understand the purpose of the Electoral College and, though the US has a crapton of problems (many of which stem from government interference) with its healthcare and the like, I'm generally of the opinion that it's not unreasonable to ask people to assume responsibility for their own issues
I'm also of the opinion that the fundamental basis for citizens to possess arms is to have a forceful recourse against the government should the time come
The above might make me unpopular with other Europeans but, hey, at least we each get respective continents to if idolise
However, as much as I might admire the principles behind the US and its political system, I have to admit that I find actual American people pretty irritating: faux friendliness, this "wholesome" shit, their *obsession* with race and sectarianism, divisive politics
As opposed to my own country and the majority of other countries on the planet
There are currently only 28 countries where same-sex marriages are legal
>Not all states allow that, as far as I know
Since the 2015 ruling of the Supreme Court, all states
>I'm curious, don't you feel attracted to other European countries where you could have one too and be probably closer to your relatives
Yes, I would prefer moving to some European countries, like Germany or Sweden
I'm just saying that the US wouldn't be a bad option for me
What I understand, not only that close
But just friends also discuss that, at least I heard it numerous times, I'm male
My country’s? Don’t know
For me it’s pizza or burgers
Meat dumplings (pelmeny) with sour cream (smetana) is ultimate food
Absolutely love it
Germany - Germania (but citizens is Niemtsy)(nemoi = mute)
Sweden - Schwetzia
Denmark - Dahneeya
Netherlands - Gollandia (old)
Hungary - Viengria
Georgia - Groozia
China - Kitay
Japan - Japonia
UK can be mentioned as Anglia
Belarus - currently being specified
"Krievija" comes from the tribes of Krivichs
I've read that even a century ago some old people from remote villages in that area called themselves "Krivs" and they didn't know that they lived in "Russia".
Give this man an ice cream
And an award
Two
Hellas sounds cooler than Greece
It's also Gruzia in Russian
I guess they call themselves Sakartveli or something like that
The words "Hungary", "Vengria" (and similar words) and "Ugric" (as in "Finno-Ugric languages") have the same origin
A lot, because "plain" or "strait" titles are taken ages ago so you go creative for not infringe into existing and or differentiate yours
Sometimes it looks cool, sometimes idiotic
We have a "depressive bar" called "Угрюмочная". Рюмка is a shot glass, and угрюмый means sullen, morose
Рюмочная is a place that serves рюмки.
I don't know why, but in Russia the image of national poetry is tied to a certain poet rather than to a literary work
That poet is, of course, Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) widely regarded as the father of modern Russian literary language style and romanticist poetry
He also wrote many prosaic texts, was the first major author who would turn to Russian folklore as to a source of inspiration and he also studied history and popularised many of its parts (it is thanks to his enthusiasm and effort that we remember about the infamous Pugachev rebellion, which Catherine II had ordered to be erased from Russian history)
That is not everything that he did, but we are more focused on literary works here, so those of you who are interested can search for more information about his biography on the Internet
Pushkin's legacy is really vast and can't be described as something of a single major poem
What they do usually name his main work, however, is "Eugene Onegin", which tells a story of a Russian byronic-type aristocrat and his love, friendship, personal tragedy
The poem contains a lot of scenes that laconically describe the lifestyle and social environment of a highborn person in Russia at that time, as well as contain quite colourful images of Russian rural and urban life, nature and tempers
That all is yet not mentioning a beautiful and heartbreaking story of the protagonist, which makes you feel a lot
The Tale of Igor's Host is old enough to be Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian national poem
For something strictly Russian, there's Eugene Onegin, which isn't an epic, but is a novel-sized poem from the early 19th century
I would have said that one of the most appreciated and impactful poems is Requiem by Anna Akhmatova:
*Но я предупреждаю вас,*
*Что я живу в последний раз.*
I actually agree with you partly
I mean, I love Akhmatova's works, really
But Pushkin is kind of too monumental for the Russian literature
Too many poets were inspired by him or saw him as an authority if you know what I mean
Actually I really like Austro-Hungarian cuisine
Big fan of spaetzle, it's one of the tastiest things ever and I don't know why it's not more popular
Weinerschnitzel
Paprikash and goulasz
Bryndzove halusky
Karadjordjeva snicla
Cevapi
Really underrated imo
>we don't try to drown the actual taste of the food with unnecessary spices to hide the taste of rot and decay
You don't use much spice but you certainly put a lot of salt
I'm not a big meat-and-potatoes sort of guy
I'd prefer some spicy curries with coconut milk and goat or lamb over some meat-and-potatoes dish
Yeah Spanish-style paella is overrated
Latin American countries often have distinct version of paella that are way spicier and more flavorful
Yeah, why pay 20 euros for some meat-and-potato dish, when in Southeastern Europe you can get a delicious pljeskavica or cevapcici for just a couple of euros
And I find those countries to have tolerable cuisines, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be
Stuff like potato dumplings, spaetzle, bigos, pierogies, they're very tasty
In Russian it’s the same as in English, without Germanic
You can use Wikipedia to check out international namings btw:
Svatá říše Římská národa Německého
Which is word for word translated  to:
Holy Empire Roman of the Nation German
Grammatically correct
Holy Roman Empire of the German nation
The Russian Wikipedia page also lists "Священная Римская империя германской нации" ("the Holy Roman Empire of the Germanic nation") as one of its names, but I've never heard anyone call it that in my life ever
There was a big movement 200 years ago, led by Alexander Shishkov
Mostly remembered because of the funny word "mokrostupy" for galoshes, "wet-steppers".
There is a certain sentiment in the government and among the population, but it doesn't clearly prevail
And the gov
itself doesn't make effort to replace loanwords
I imagine all his presentations of the new language principles were aborted by the audience unable to stop snickering at mokrostupy
We just call them galoši
So relatable
Same in Russian: "izolirovatj".
If something is "actual" in a normal language, it's often "relevant" in English
Lol people who voting for putin are incomparably dumb
Oh, we have such guys as well
They uses selfmade USSR documents and cause long argues with "illegitimate" police officers, don't pay bills and taxes etc
Well, World War I lost us the empire and had most of the ethnicities in it gain statehood for themselves
Which isn't in my opinion a bad thing
World War II, well, only when the government wants an excuse to take land from our neighbors
There's a narrative that Russia's imperialism has always been about safety for the heartland, and while that may have been ONE of the concerns; it was definitely not the only reason
This is a pretty good breakdown of it:
Japan still wants to get back some if not all of the Kuril Islands and because of it we still haven’t formally signed a peace treaty
We got a fancy seat in UNSC as a major victor of WWII which also influences our foreign relations
I'm russian and many older people still find germans our enemies (they even call them nazis)
Yes, still very huge
Mostly the after-effects of WWII tbh
The "liberation" of our neighboring countries made them very skeptical of us, and it impacts our foreign relations a lot to this very day
Some Russians still think that all Germans are bad nation
Im new to the sub, but guys
Do you have that thread every fucking week discussing WW2
Russian teens love Germany more than Russia
I'd blame the Britons for abandoning you when the Germans were attacking for that personally
Throughout my entire life, I've never met a single elderly person, including WWII veterans, who thought in a such way
Every family has a veteran of this war
I know many elder people and nobody said such bullshit
The main opinion is completely opposite - they fought not against Germans they fought against Fascism
Said an American whose nation only earned money from that -\_-
Have you ever seen Odnoklassniki
Actually no, after the 2017 massive anti-soviet propaganda started here
Some teens really believe KGB killed everyone who they see
Is it sarcasm
Yeah
British officer: "Oof, it's getting a bit sticky here
Let's just withdraw on both the Portuguese flanks without actually telling them we're pulling back
It'll be fine
Can You elaborate more
I don't think 'Odnoklassniki' represents the majority
I don't think most of the elderly people know about 'Odnoklassniki' either
Odnoklassniki is a trash bin
It was America's decision to participate in the war
I mean, of course it's good that they decided to participate, but there's nothing they should hate Germany for
Why
True, but many use it seriously
I'm sure that "хочу сказать этому ебаному абэмэ нахуй" was completely serious too
Oh, sorry for misunderstanding
Yes, communism memes really popular now
Yes, something like this
That's nice :)
Those дегенераты usually stick a sticker "можем повторить" to their cars
They're just stupid and don't count
Why
Because any country consists of stupid people
Sorry guys, Im not good at history then :)
I only knew about the US nuked two towns in Japan, so I used to consider the US as an agressor
Да считаются они, таких много (у меня в селе каждая 6 машина такая, или со стикером с танками)
Сейчас people не любят их, дегенераты сами understand и реже клеят this sticker
Guess they don't really know what is communism and never read communist literature
My biggest cultural conflict with the Americans on this site is over (what I view to be) faux positivity and general insincerity
Approaching these in order, what I mean is:
-Faux positivity; when they post what seem to be really forced memes, pictures or stories that desperately try to push through a positive narrative but seem somewhat removed from reality (e.g. "This brave pupper guarding our airport
" or anything from /r/WholesomeMemes [the whole sub feels totally forced and contrived to me
] My apologies for not explaining this very well, but I'm a person who very much values sincerity and straightforwardness and I find myself feeling fundamentally suspicious of people who effect faux positivity
-General insincerity; this is definitely fed by the upvote culture of Reddit, but suffice to say that it seems a great chunk of what they write (especially when pursuing humour) is for the purpose of pandering
On a more sinister side though, there's something present on this site that's also seen to an extent in my culture
and that's feigned empathy/expressions of concern (likely in the name of virtue signalling); the whole "sending you hugs
" or "Hey Redditors, how're you feeling today
Removed from the above, also somewhat annoying (but understandable) is all the pop culture references
You see an interesting post and scroll down to the comments to look for discussion or further information but you get some in-jokes and then random quotations from American TV series or films
E.g. "TIL Beavers won't chew on the sunny side of trees
"DAMN IT MARK
"Rachel that's not a toaster
"This is why we can't enjoy our Wednesdays
Or something like that
And I'm just led bewildered and rapidly scrolling down trying to find something I can relate to
Edit: One area of personal experience I can apply what I perceive to be an American idea of "false wholesomeness" to would be my brief experiences with seeing a cognitive behavioural therapist; he led in our first session saying I need to understand and tell myself that everyone is born with equal value; that we all have talents and skills that ultimately level us all out as being equally capable in our own ways
I just found that to be what I'd call a platitude and it seems like a lot of Americans live by those; they repeat some mantra or phrase ad nauseum to motivate themselves (take a look at /r/motivation) and delude/lie about the nature of reality
I'm pretty on top of my issues but I'm somewhat proud of the fact that I reasoned myself as far as I got and didn't have to rely on crutches or self-deception
which I view as fundamentally dishonest and I just can't go along with (largely because my feeling that I'm aware of their *being* deceptions makes me unable to be fooled by them)
But I may well be overly cynical
For the record, I'm British but I moved to Russia and, though I have a lot of conflicts with the mentality here, I generally fit in much better here with the general "mood" of people than I did back home
As much as I love the American Constitution and the philosophical basis of their country, I think I'd really clash with the people themselves if I ever lived there
I feel culturally isolated even here
This is a problem
A lot of American Redditors perceived themselves as generally well-informed or having a sound perspective on life as a whole and yet when they articulate what they consider to be pressing issues they seem to fail to understand that the phenomena they describe (e.g. systemic racism) is generally largely an American problem (or at least their understanding of it is) and their experiences, critique and proposed solutions don't apply to the rest of the world
Yet they'll soapbox as if these are the pressing issues of our time for the world as a whole
Wow, you described what I felt, but couldn't put to words
I felt like in many subs people too often try to "sell" you something
They make a post, and include YOUR intended reaction in the title
" You shlould blah blah", "This is an awesome blah blah that I blah blah". And in the comments it is most likely just repeating the same thing over and over again, without adding any substance
Belgians taught me that mayonnaise on chips are the bomb
I'm bored of all the posts about anti-vaxxers and flat earthers
Even on the internet, I've never encountered advocates of either and find the posts to just be wasting space
Because Edirne is in continental Europe
I guess
I mean, that's not a problem
Despite being in Europe we are hugely different from most of it
I'm here due to curiosity
I'm from the UK but live in Russia (haven't figured out how to change my flair to show that :P)
I'm sure we've some "rar rar" idiots back home who buy into that bull but I associate with few people as it is, let alone bored middle class 4x4-driving mothers, lol
Moscow: just a very, very big city
Petersburg: seems like a more loved city by Russians & foreigners than Moscow
Omsk: nobody escapes Omsk, N/A
Astrakhan: I hate it, because of so many jokes about it on AskARussian, please stop
Norilsk: one of the coldest places on the planet from those where many people live
There's a pasta about it above on comments
Very few of our older folks have anything good to say about the Imperial era - though I suspect that's because the last Tsar was completely incompetent more than any real opposition to the regime in general
A lot of them miss the USSR for one reason or another though
Because almost everyone who didn't support the new regime was completely wiped out
Agree
True
"Been hoarding grain, Comrade Neykuratick
Oh dear, off you go
There are some recognizable ethnic names, but that Ajdar Ajupov can be a Tatar from Tambov or Vladivostok
There's one curious case, though: someone with a very traditional combination of peasantish ethnic Russian names is just as likely to be a Jakut as a Russian
>a very traditional combination of peasantish ethnic Russian names is just as likely to be a Jakut as a Russian
Probably *more* likely to be a Yakut
Old-timey-sounding names like Fedot, Gavriil, Afanasij, etc
, seem pretty common among modern Yakuts while having almost completely fallen out of use among ethnic Russians
I know St Januarius is the patron saint of Naples, so Gennaro is like Spiro on Corfu
I was born in Armenia, Echmiadzin
Beautiful place by the way
But I was almost toddler when I moved to Russia
I don’t really want to live in Armenia at all but I want to visit it again
I was there about five years ago and it’s tough to be far from my homeland
Yeah, you’re right
Good choice for tourists definitely

Well check this out then:
Haluatko tanssia lakanavalssia
He said "Me eats bread".
So relatable
We made our bases too
Luckily, I lived on the edge of the town, and we had a vast forest right next to the neighbourhood
That's amazing, wanna construct one now
I don't think we do anything to honor victims of ww1
I agree, also people don't learn much about WWI in schools
Idk why, probably because Russia lost
Or the originals
We always called it by short name
In Russian Czechia is a normal way to refer to that country, so I just find this name much more convenient and familiar than Czech Republic
Honestly, most Russians are surprised when they learn that Czech Republic is more often called like that in English
My answer is basically the same as u/bartenderdude94
I've always called it that (Чехия) anyway
In Russian we already called it Chekhija (Чехия), so I'm fine with the shortening
I'm not sure, however, how to pronounce it properly in English, so I just say Che(k)hia (Чехиа)
same here, we say "Чехия", but never "Чешская республика"
I don't get what are you talking about
I just transcribe й as j instead of y, bc then you're mashing 2 very different sounds in one symbol, and I doubt if someone who doesn't know Russian would be able to tell where is which
You can only use "-ija" ("-ия") in Russian
I pronounced "Czechia" with -ia only because it's like that in English (and, well, i was talking about how I pronounced it in English)
Ah, no, there are no such words I can think of
Pretty sure even fictional names get transcribed with -ия
The red one
Love the simplicity
Well we had the same flag
The only reason that thte flag of the czech republic looks the way it looks is because Poland declared first as their flag
I personally think that we have a better flag because of that
Yeah
With the sickle and hammer
Flags with 3 stripes are unoriginal
Absolutely the same here
Similar to us: "revnostnyj" vs "revnivyj" (or "revnosten" vs "revniv" when the short form is used)
The map you've linked it VERY outdated
Even the generations of our grandparents (I'm 21) don't speak with most of those regional features anymore except a few odd ones
Of course, there still exist some regional differences, but they are really nothing in comparison to, for example, English dialects currently spoken *within* England
As to your comment in a different thread, Russian is a very prescriptivist language where people absolutely love to establish a "correct" form for every situation in accordance with the literary norm, so you'll find a lot of people arguing about what is proper and what isn't. Especially stress patterns, being the most variable and ever changing part of the language, suffer the most from this
Stress patterns change slightly depending on the region, but I believe there's more variation between individuals than between regions
There are several exclusive words for each regions, but that's it
Pronunciation really doesn't differ as if it was referred as a dialect
But there is one thing in Russia called a Russian North - Arkhangelsk region
It's populated with folks who preserved or at least tried to preserve their tradition, old Russian language since Oprichnina of Ivan the Terrible, since serfdom law and even partially since soviet rule
I really had a hard time understanding elder people's speech
Though it definitely was Russian
One of my [favourite videos] showcasing a dialect
Yes, some sounds are pronounced differently, but I have zero problems understanding him
You have to look for the oldest women in the most remote villages to find a dialect broad enough to be incomprehensible to an outsider
Bro aren’t “Irish” and Gaelic, like, the same thing
Gaelic can refer to either Scottish or Irish, which are closely related Celtic languages
Scots is a Germanic language closely related to English
Well, his speech is peppered with paramilitary slang and swearing like a Thai dish, but I understand him just fine
Gaelic my balls lmao
Standardized school education, standardized language in state media, massive forced and voluntary relocations of the people
Try totalitarianism, use new ideology to wipe out all traditions in order to build a default soviet citizen and force new language standards
Also to achieve better results deport as many citizens as you can to the distant lands and vice versa
Not really strict language programs in every village, but regional variations were heavily marginalised and considered uneducated and incorrect
We still have a lot of freaks obsessed with "speaking properly" and annoying the hell out of other people just going about their daily life
There's this person called Tatiana Gartman who has earned herself fame by mocking politicians and media people for making "mistakes" in their speech and calling them lazy idiots who can't be bothered to look into the dictionary ([link] to her YouTube channel)
At the same time, she has been repeatedly heard making *the same* mistakes she "exposes". Her excuse
"It was a hard day, I was really exhausted by 10pm" etc
Many of her explanations are incorrect and anti-science, which has been shown by a few actual linguists
Yet her popularity isn't going anywhere anytime soon
Yes, by Mikitko (I watch his videos about Russian every now and then, very insightful, recommend 10/10) and a few others whose names I can't remember
Moscow is the capital of everything in Russia
There's a small tech hub near Kazanj, but it's for people who don't like big cities
If you want to advance your career, you go to Moscow
Well, there's Siberian oil and gas companies, if you have a hands-on job you might have to go to the towns along the Obj

The most outrageous example I can think of: during the 2018 World Cup, the local Burger King offered 3 million rubles and lifetime supply of burgers to Russian women who would get pregnant from professional football players
They deleted the post and apologized the same day
I have no idea how anyone from their marketing team could think it was appropriate
They always use edgy and borderline inappropriate ads, but that was something else
All I remember from last year was a male friend I made in the UK [sending me this] with a winking emoji

Edit: Got onto a laptop and did the formatting anyway
Yup, Burger King kept making trashy ads for quite a while
e.g. [this one] says "пшлнх мкднлдс", which literally translates to "gfy mcdnlds". [another one] warns you not to "обострись" - this word is a portmanteau of "обосрись" (to shit yourself) and "острый" (spicy)
>which literally translates to "gfy mcdnlds".
I'd translate it as "gfckrslf mcdnlds" to preserve the idea of stripping all vowels

Australia (by land area)
Russia is pretty small
Everyone thinks it's big, but I wish it was bigger
It's the smallest country that I still think of as big (that is, Australia is big, but everything smaller than Australia is not)
Seems like an Austrian already commented that :)
They're kinda medium-sized
Yeah
I mean I once said that New Zealand is small, and someone replied that New Zealand is quite big because it's about the size of Italy
My reaction: ???
They make up ~40% of all countries' land combined
Besides, I would label ~130 countries (out of ~200) as small
From lifestyle perspective it's definitely Moscow
It offers so much more than the rest of the country
From a tourist perspective I would pick Suzdal, a lovely little old town with a rustic atmosphere and well-preserved examples of early Russian architecture
And mead
Russian memes are entire world and they are absolutely different from English memes
I didn't know many English memes before visit Reddit but local memes were everywhere
The so-called "post-ironic" memes have exploded in popularity last year
They're often abstract and/or completely meaningless
It was good but than came post-irony and it's not even funny
So now I'm here
Not a single day but actually 2 days we went to Velikiy Novgorod
On the first day we had a tour around the Nobgorod Kremlin (IIRC it's the oldest Kremlin in Russia)
It's connected to the city by a cool 250 meter bridge and inside the Kremlin there are a lot of old buildings (now museum)
A church there has gates that were forged in Magdeburg in 1153 and they have bible scenes depicted on them
But the main thing is the Millennium of Russia monument
It's basically a giant bell with 3 rows which portray every important person in the history of Russia from 882 (I think it's when Rus was established bit I'm not sure) untill like 1800s when this monument was made
The most interesting thing is that the monument  was cast and it's really huge
Google it, very interesting
On the second day we just walked around the city and did a horror quest
Really cool stuff
Even though I written another thing I had that too
Our school runs an exchange stundent program with a Finnish school for pupils with good english
Part of our program was Fazer chocolate factory too
So cool
Oh cool in Russia we have a similar tradition
There's a holiday called "Масленица" (Maslenitsa) where we burn a giant doll that represents a spirit of winter ti scare winter away
After that we cook tons of pancakes
I guess we are all slavic bros/sisters after all
Parents at best, but usually friends and the Internet
People of school and the outside world but not the education system itself
Russia
We had an hour of sex ed instead of a biology lesson in one of the later grades (i.e., too late)
It amounted to "STDs bad, use condoms" and a few drawings of people's genitalia cut in half lengthwise
Before that it took me quite a long time to realize what sex even amounted to
I had a book for kids about health that had a chapter on sex and related topics, and it didn't bother explaining that in the most basic case you have to insert a penis into a vagina and slide it back and forth
No, it jumped straight to the dangers of masturbation and early pregnancy
Nationalists who choose to move to a different country are a peculiar sort
I could never take a Russian nationalist living in Canada seriously
After all, if you have consciously made a choice for your descendants to have no part in the ethnicity you supposedly hold so dear, what sort of nationalist are you really
Does your mother ever talk about moving back to Ukraine
If Peter I's childhood tutor and friend Nikita Zotov hadn't been chosen by his mother, he probably would have grown up to be much like his father; competent but not exactly welcoming toward outside influences -- keeping Russia in a state of backwardness
Zotov helped Peter organize games involving live ammunition and cannons at Preobrazhenskoe (which later gave it's name to the first of Peter's Guard regiments - the Preobrazhenskiy); ordered him globes of the planet; engravings of cities like Paris and London etc simply because he was good enough to notice Peter's inclinations
Ironically, Tsaritsa Natalia only chose him because of his knowledge of the Bible in Russian and Greek
Edit: I can't spell cannons evidently
Lol thats nice
What years is it
I want to read about that part
Ha, we have pretty same story)))
To be fair, Hitler thought we were weak anyway because of his racial ideology -- our shitty performance in the Winter War just reinforced it in his mind
Apart from the Mongols and in 1917, you mean
We probably do
I have an extremely small, almost negligible amount (2%)
The rest is Slavic
And hey, it's amazing what people will do for the lure of money
Yes and no
Yes, in that executing a good chunk made the rest (even the good ones) quite unwilling to show initiative, and instead stuck to the bad plan knocked up in a few days to avoid punishment
No, in that there were many who survived the purge and went off-piste when needed
Zhukov for example, was never afraid to tell Stalin what he actually thought
The guy who came up with the plan that finally broke through the Finns, Timoshenko was on the older side
but another one
Really, it was a mixture of bad leadership; non-acclimatized troops with none of the basic equipment needed to fight in the winter; the weather itself limited our attacks to sectors the Finns had already pre-identified (i.e. Raate Road); and the aforementioned extremely basic and bad plan
Our English textbook in primary school said that the future tense should be formed with "shall" in first person singular/plural, but the teacher told us it was the old-fashioned way pretty much right away, so it wasn't a problem
There were probably other things, but I don't remember them
Regarding "how do you do
", my grandparents were taught that phrase when they were in school, but we weren't, as far as I remember
Turns out real Germans can't themselves stack more than one dependent clause in a real sentence without bungling up the verb order
Like, "I found the man who cleaned the booth which we sat in yesterday" is not ended with "gesessen haben geputz hat gefunden" in actual spoken German
We were taught the same thing about "yes" and "no".
We were taught the same thing about English, and I found it weird, like why would I say my name to potential scammers or some other ill-wishers
We were taught that supper was outdated, but I've actually seen some native English speakers say "supper" to refer either to full dinner or or a light night snack
Must be regional then
I've actually heard people keep the "ne" even in casual YouTube videos
It's probably not the most common way to go, but let's say I've witnessed it more than 10 times in the last couple of months
All words like Peace and Love,
All sane affirmative speech,
Had been soiled, profaned, debased
To a horrid mechanical screech
> “Supper” (and about a dozen other words for meals between 12pm and 9pm) vary wildly based on region and vernacular in my experience
Not a single English textbook I've read ever mentioned that some people in England call it "tea".
Even "shall"? Like, for example, would you say "I shall go to the doctor tomorrow" instead of "will" or something
One of my guest professors from Oxbridge used to say in RP something like 'hasidoa'
He probably got it from British Poles
Really interesting, I thought it had pretty much fallen out of use except in instructions (like "one shall do X"), suggestions (like "shall we do X?"), or when you want to sound like Gandalf ("you shall not pass")
My dad went to the same university classes as a guy whose last name was just Filin (great horned owl, *bubo bubo*), and this guy's most commonly uttered phrase was obviously "I have a given name, you know
We have a city named after Saint Peter, a city which name literally derives from a word "Archangel", and also a city, the name of which means "Master of the East". Hell yeah I like our cities' names
On a more serious note, our cities' names are really quite nice and distinctive, and that is very convenient since Russia has many cities and towns
It is a beautiful mix of cultures and ages really
So, Софья? That's just an older variant of the same name
I reckon it's somewhere in Siberia, most likely in Taiga
It's not the only area that counts as "nowhere", but it's in the *middle* of nowhere
If it was separate country it could be the biggest country in the world
Well, you see
Jokes on you, my best friend's wife is from Kropyvnytsky

But I met him on the wedding, so I kinda know him
People from smaller towns are moving to the big cities, and especially to Moscow
I encountered "radioactive materials burial site" sign while walking in the forest around St
Petersburg
What's worse, I arrived to the sign from the *back* side, meaning that I just left the site
We have a triangle road sign (red edge white canvas) with a tank on it
And a caption "Warning: Tanks" sometimes with "sudden gunfire" warning or like that
It kinda fun when you see it on a picture, but kinda scaring if you see it through your windshield in the middle of nowhere
Like that:[
But that not Russia-specific and I didn't see where I live (but did see once ot twice)
We have a fancy sign where a scull and crossed bones depicted, with a striking bolt, and a warning "No climb or be killed"
Why is it better
If you left mine field, you're just okay
But of you left radioactive zone, who knows
It is quite popular in my hometown, but it's not really developed on a national level due to poor infrastructure (for rugby)  and lack of financing
However, since last couple of years, the popularity of the sport is slowly increasing
Eggs are sold not refrigerated, but we put them in the fridge at home
With milk, it depends on what milk you buy, but any is put in the fridge after opening
I think british people like warm milk, with a foam especially
In Russia the same
I think it seldom happens here, as people tend to finish all of the food they've ordered right in the restaurant
But it isn't a problem if you ask
I have a friend with quite unusual eating habits, and he does it all the time
I use two keyboard layouts: the standard US English QWERTY and the Russian ЙЦУКЕН. Basically the same as everyone else in Russia, I'm not original
Keyboards sold in Russia have labels for both layouts ([like that]
To clarify, pressing (usually) Shift + Alt will let you switch the layout quickly on Windows
I also don't look at the keyboard when I type, so using PCs in Germany and Austria was pure torture
I hate the tall Enter with a passion
That's where the backslash and the bar live, and I need both of them
Both combinations are fairly common in Russia, not sure which one is more prevalent
I personally use Alt+Shift, but if I use somebody else's computer, I usually try both
No, since they are two different alphabets
Greece
Greek and Roman cultures are very similar, and don't forget the Byzantine Empire
Constantinople definitely deserves the title of "Second Rome". Another interesting thing is that Moscow is called the "Third Rome", but it's only because Muscovy became the centre of Orthodoxy after 1453
So it's definitely Greece
>Germans knock on tables following a meeting
Oh, that's funny, we knock on the table (or something else wooden) three times as a superstition when telling about something bad that could happen (so it wouldn't happen)
Like "if we go to the forest and get lost there - knock, knock, knock - we do x then". Or, alternatively, you say something like "he is *that* stupid" and knock on the table to show how very stupid
We traditionally have two layers of curtains for that, for example
Closer to the window is тюль layer [ which is very light and allows sun in just fine but makes it hard to see what's inside, and second layer is some thick fabric for the dark time
Oh, I understand
Our people kinda feel uncomfortable, I guess, if the window is close to places where people walk and can look in, so most keep these light curtains drawn at all times
But if your window is on some high floor with no buildings around or in the middle of private garden, that's another situation
Though our noms' generation demands tiul' on any floor and any window, according to them a window without tiul' just doesn't look right, heh
Eh, it depends on what size of window is small and what is not, I guess
But yeah, they usually not the size of the wall for sure
I measured mine, as they are typical proportion for high-rise building, so window starts \~ 85cm from the floor level and \~50cm from the walls, something like 20-30cm from the ceiling it ends
On a big wall the window is bigger too, on the small smaller
I think, the main reason is the weather - walls keep the warmth inside much better than the windows
In Soviet time a technology of wind-cold-proof plastic windows didn't exist yet, so naturally in older buildings big windows meant cold rooms
Our typical models of dachas (wooden summer houses) usually have big verandas with wooden windows on \~80% of the wall - but those rooms are usable only in the summer as a result, you just can't keep them warm in the winter
This kind of windows I'm talking about [

We have bail, but it's optional and the investigator or the judge has to allow it
It's rare enough that no market niche has formed around it
I can't even find out whether skipping bail is a crime or not
I think the only punishment is that you'll be arrested if caught and your bail will be forfeit
Pastila from Belôv. Unlike modern factory pastila, which is homogenous and made with agar, this pastila is just Antonovka apple puree, powdered sugar and beaten egg whites baked into thin sweet and sour sponges which are then stuck together into sliceable loaves
Once, my SO offered to cook a soup traditional to a country of my choosing, so I randomly said "the Netherlands". Fast forward a few years, snert is now a staple of our home cooking, and literally no one I know besides us knows about it

What does "historically Ukrainian Kyiv Rus" mean
The Ukrainian identity started to emerge in the 17th century, while Kyivan Rus existed until the middle of the 13th century
The dynamics among the principalities (that included parts of modern Ukraine *and* Russia *and* Belarus) were completely different
Not that I have anything against the name
I think it’s perfect as it is
I actually thought about that
North Macedonia shouldn’t have taken Greece’s petty bullshit and tried to come up with a way around this issue

Nina is a wonderful name
Good choice
Hate that name
I’m Anton and for some very odd reason almost all teachers used to call me Artyom every now and then instead of my actual name
Always thought it was strange as those names are not really that similar
No, we don't unfortunately
Gergians are pretty keen to use Greek names, just like Russians
Mainly because they're also ordodox Christians
So we kinda share those names because of the church
Examples: Mikhail, Alexander, Nina (Nino in Georgian), Sergey (Sergo in Georgian), Georgy, etc
Edit: spelling
I like Ukrainian version of usual Greek names
Whenever I hear Mycola or something of this kind I imagine dashing Cossacks galloping onward with sabers above their heads
Super badass
You will definitely see a lot of that in Russia, but the messages are usually more random like "I love summer" or whatever, they aren't about identity or ideology
Fairly common here in Russia, though I don't know how it compares to other brands
Probably because you have to pay less for them
I've noticed they tend to be cheaper, though I still avoid them like the plague

Of all the European languages to choose, I'm happy the one that's a mess but relatively easy to learn was the one to be dominant
I shudder at the thought of German or French taking it's place in another timeline
China
Russia is becoming their low-cost petrol station with a trade surplus, which is compensated by Chinese agricultural, industrial and electric goods which in turn weaken Russia's domestic production
They are quite unpredictable and expansive with soft power
USA threatens with economic sanctions because they must, but overall historically they are Russia's main strategic partners
Not sure about Mongolia
What do we know about them
North Korea, people forget we're right next to that cook
I wonder what country that guy’s talking about
You forgot Japan that has territorial claims on some Russian land and enough military power to press them
On the western front we are the bully, but the situation in the east is less in our favor
While I doubt anything will happen this decade, you never know what could happen
Japan has an increasingly powerful right-wing
Well, Berlin is on main tank route between Warsaw and Paris
Poland, Germany, Belarus and Russia all have that wide open plain
Do a double take and read what the weird letters spell out
Who else
Certainly not Russia
It’s a tiny country sandwiched together between Poland and Lithuania, after all
Yeah, this is pretty much the way I see it too
Japan gave up on Sakhalin, but I'm sure they would opportunistically grab some of the Kuril islands in case of Russian weakness
As for the Chinese, I don't think they'll openly become antagonistic with Russia to dominate the Far East, but once again, they most definitely can try to do something funny in case of severe problems in Russian center
Dude, he’s clearly joking

I don’t think there is morality in geopolitics (apart from being a rhetorical tool to accuse an opponent), but that occupation doesn’t really improve your security and wastes a lot of resources
Practically the same here
We think we can punch upwards if we allocate more resources to our foreign policy, but we only manage to punch the new superpowers in the dick
Sooner or later this will have to end when our domestic infrastructure collapses
I said in “geopolitics”, not “politics”. Check up on the difference
> Putin recently lost some seats in Parliament to the communist party
Yes, it was a tactical vote, but it was the Moscow regional parliament, not the federal one
Not much, to be honest
Perhaps something about the Egyptian history and the fact that a lot of North Africa is Muslim and speaks varieties Arabic and also part of it speaks French due to the colonization
Also, Egypt and to a lesser extent Tunisia and Algeria are popular tourist destinations for Russians
To me, the Middle East and Central Asia are the closest non-European regions
I wouldn't say that I know a whole lot more about the Middle East than about North Africa, but Central Asia is very familiar to me as we have more shared history with them (they were part of the USSR) and a lot of immigrants from there

I recently got into the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars when I ran a Kickstarter to design English and Dutch model ships centred around the period and the latter were a real pleasure to build
Though they were still somewhat ornate, they were much more understated and, frankly, elegant than the ostentatious and gilded monstrosities the English were putting out
I guess the Dutch had the better Protestant sensibilities
For the Dutch I modelled Zeven Provincien, [Prins Willem (an Indiaman)] a [Man of War] and a [fluyt] (Fluyt is centre, Zeven Provincien is behind on the left)
For contrast, here are two British first rates

Out of interest, is your word for 'handgun' and 'revolver' the same
Because shotguns and rifles are two completely different types of weapon
Both "city" and "town" are "город (gorod)". AFAIK, this is the case in many languages,
A night dream and sleep
Both are сон.
"Hand" and "arm" are both "ruka" in Russian
Privacy and intimacy are both intimitate in Romanian
Apparently, "month" is etymologically related to "moon".
Back when semi-auto pistols were new, many Russians called them revolvers, because to them a pistol meant a muzzleloader
Yes, Romania
We say "mesyats" for month and "luna" for moon so there's no obvious connection between the two in Russian
I've just realised that we also use "mesyats" for a moon *crescent*. But the ordinary word for "moon" in general is "luna".
Nothing to do, lol
Ever heard of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity
I think we use "mesyats" and "polumesyats" more or less interchangeably
The latter sounds a bit more poetic
I certainly don't identify with my city or region
I do identify as a Russian, but that's more of a fact than an actual identity
I guess they do, some more than others
The strongest local identity can be found in Tuva and the Caucasus

Russia has a lot of variations of outside kids games
(It is although possible that other countries have the same or similar variations) One of my favourite was tag but the "It" is always the same and when he touches you you need to stand like a star until someone slides between your legs and then you can run again
"It's" goal is to tag everybody
It was so fun you wouldn't even believe it
When we were older (say 10-11, maybe even 12-13) we played IRL DnD

We made quests, weapons from wood, even clan wars with some neighbourhoods
It was so epic
I wanted to pin point those games because I didn't just wanna answer with those generic "Play videogames, watch TV, football" of course I did it, but I think the OP asks us for the country specific things

I don't like this line of thinking
It never "happened", but war almost broke out multiple times and people such as Vasili Arhipov had to disobey protocol and later be reprimanded for it in order to save the world
We have too much snow that snow removal service does not have time to clean it
But I live in Siberia so
Nevermind)
Just east of Moscow, like 5 cm of snow that appeared like 3 days ago, and they say even this will melt soon
Yes, snow cover is around 50 cm here in Urals
It only snowed in Noveember
We have surprisingly little snow this year in Nizhny Novgorod
I think there were less than 30 days of permanent snow so far, which is fairly unusual
And there is still not enough snow to prevent it from melting if the temperature goes above 0 again
As far as I remember, it has always been considered a scam by both young and elderly people
I seriously have no idea how they make profits with such a low popularity
Flying the hammer and sickle over the Reichstag building probably
English speech is the most beautiful for me
I can’t hear any other with such delight
Especially when it comes to commentators work in huge sport events
Quite a lot
Most (but not all) of female rulers of Russia were foreign-born, and were not ethnic Russians
But those europeans kings, queens etc
ethnicity is hard to determine as tney were (and I think are) like one big monarchy family
Those females became a ruler after their husband Tsar or Imperor of Russia died
All the time
From rurik, to romanovs, to lenin, to stalin, to khruchev
Hу wasn't foreign-born
The country he ruled was USSR, and Georgia where he was born, was part of it
But "thank you" anyways :)
> leadership of the CPSU who wanted to sway things in Russia's favor
*cough* Crimea 1954
It's not an exception
Per capita RSFSR consumed less good than produced
It's not that simple
Everyone was celebrating new millenium during January 1, 2000
I think any of the lines from Alexander Blok’s short poem [“Night, street, lamp, drugstore”]
«Ночь, улица, фонарь, аптека,
Бессмысленный и тусклый свет.
Живи еще хоть четверть века —
Всё будет так. Исхода нет.»
———————————————
“Night, street, lamp, drugstore,
A dull and meaningless light
Go on and live another quarter century -
Nothing will change
There's no way out
Kinda nihilistic
We learned it at school and everyone was reciting it since then
One of my dad's favourite stories is how he helped two warrant officers who stood watch with him (or sat, since that was at the border guards HQ)
When he arrived they were trying to solve a crossword puzzle and were at the end of their collective wit
The hint was "Night, street, lamp, ...", they said they had come up with every single thing that could happen under or near a streetlamp at night, but none worked
When he said, "Drugstore
" and it obviously fit, they were floored
"Comrade captain, *why* would it be drugstore
Ukraine — Everything Is Illuminated
Not my country, but I’ve been to Ukraine many times (my wife is from there)
I actually fell in love with Bruges because of that film
Visited twice since and am still pretty much in love
Have you seen Russian films about Sherlock Holmes
How *do* you make friends with people from Scotland
I find it a bit challenging to understand the temper and sense of humour
That being said, I've never been in a bad conversation with a Scottish person, only very entertaining\good ones
Same here (without the divorce part, lol)
Yes you’ll get a lot of angry noises from the Visegrad countries
Eastern Europe =/= Russia, you’re just further perpetuating the stereotypes that you so much hate
Occupation
Yes, we totally don't need it
* *coughs in bias* *
Depends on what you mean by bread
In a broader sense, many other parts of the world have staple foods made of flour, e.g. Chinese steamed buns or various Indian flatbreads
This
I would not Iimit myself to the listed countries, though
You can find unique and delicious cheese in every European country
Actually, most varieties of cheese are very low in lactose and safe to eat for most lactose-intolerant people
Kefalotyri and Graviera are less popular, but great and deserve to be known much better than they are
I love lubelski cider
We get polish food as a standard in our shops
Besides their food is almost exactly same as ours
Greece I love their mythology and how depending on where you were born depended on what you would do it’s just so fascinating
I think that history of every country has much to tell and from time to time I become curious about history of a random country, but I like history of Russia most because I feel connected to it and for me it is not simply a knowledge, but also a part of my identity
If to talk about other countries, History of Greece is amazing
From Leonidas to Justinian, from Athens to Constantinople
Fascinating
If you don't mind my asking, why
To start, I'd recommend the biographies of Catherine and Peter by Massie (his scholarship on them is amazing and packed full of background details of the country during their reigns); and Sebag Montefiore's '*The Romanovs*' (which despite it's name actually starts with the reign of Ivan Grozny and the fallout from his dynasty's dying out
'*Natasha's Dance*' is
acceptable as a starter for Russian culture but I don't agree with the author's conclusions sometimes
I haven't yet, but it's on my list to read
What's your rating of it
They're literally called "Catherine the Great" and "Peter the Great" (by Robert Massie)
Maybe if you'd even done the most perfunctory of Google searches, you could have saved us both some time
>Catherine and Peter by Massie
FTFY
I think I can remember Russian and Soviet anthems, I also know first 2 lines of Ukrainian and Belarusian ones
Also just realized that I've never heard the Kazakh anthem before, and [it's very good imo]
>general mindset is if someone is rich he must’ve stolen/exploited someone
Yes
And everyone thinks that's OK, 'cause they will do the same, if they get a chance
Everyone here in Russia likes to flaunt the money they earn
I know guys who've sold their houses so they can afford a flashy car, and live in rented housing now
Like the Romanian guy said; people like to flex
I guess going from dreary mediocrity to suddenly having a good amount of cash to spend does that to you
And yes, I'm no exception to this in some ways
The most difficult accent to understand would be an accent of someone who doesn't use Russian as a primary language, e.g. someone from a village in the North Caucasus
But even then it's not really difficult to understand
Enforcement of the standard dialect in education and mass migrations all over the country
Some people still speak with some features of their traditional local accents, but those are far and between compared to 100 years ago, and many people don't have those features
In general, a random person wouldn't be able to pinpoint where someone's from depending on their accent, unlike the UK or Germany
Sometimes it's possible if the person has some very noticeable features of a particular area, but you need some luck finding such a person
Most of the time, those features are extremely subtle (since they were able to survive education by not being marked "wrong" by the teacher :D)
So only someone knowledgeable about phonetics and old dialects would be able to notice that
I don't think the concept of ethnically Russian is relevant these days
But more than 50% of the population have Slavic ancestry in most regions, if that's what you're talking about
The ethnic russians managed to do it in time when colonialism was still 'acceptable', to say the least (not that it makes it better or anything)
I'll refer you to the map of [the traditional Russian dialects] which encompasses a very small part in the West of Russia
Today these dialects are essentially gone due to the enforcement of the standard dialect
It has also happened in France and Poland to a large extent, as far as I know
All of those places used to have comparable linguistic diversity to Denmark
The same thing would happen in Denmark if according long-term policies were in place
I guess it is less irony, more projection
They also replaced 'the Russia is a multi ethnic state' to 'the russians are state forming ethnos' in constitution this summer
Sad stuff all around
I live 70 km east of Moscow
It usually snows November to March, but I honestly don't know what to expect after the last winter
I live in the southern Russia and we had no proper snow for the last 6 years
I lived in the North before and it was miserable
Wouldn't recommend 6 months of snow to anyone
Although people tell there is less snow lately
My country is big as hell
But specifically in my city (located in Western Siberia) we can see the snow from October to April
South-Western Siberia
Snow from middle of November to the end of March
April is typical spring month but one week heatwave can happens
Thousands separators other than a space are incredibly confusing and shouldn't be a part of people's lives in 21st century
Use whatever for your decimal separators, but the space is enough for thousands
I'd say it's the norm for young people, at least in my experience
Regarding older folks, it's not necessarily the norm, but it's not a big deal for most people
Most of them fall somewhere on the spectrum of "cultural" Orthodoxy, meaning they identify as Orthodox Christian "because they were baptised as a baby" or "because they live in a traditionally Orthodox country", but they don't follow any religious traditions
I'd say those who are real Christians (like really believe in a god, go to church, follow the teachings of the Babble, etc
) would receive more attention than atheists
The religious ones are the weird ones in here
Religion isn't a favourite subject for a debate
People in the czech republic more or less don't care about god too much
I only know 5 religious people and one of them is american so that doesn't count
Normally
It's definitely not the default stance, but it's not uncommon
Most people say they're orthodox christians, but the absolute majority doesn't follow any traditions and/or visits church only on Easter or something
You may have some problems is your family is religious, but I don't think that's widespread
I think Atheism, or at least non-practicing Christianity, is the norm in the UK
As an Atheist myself, though, I think it's concerning that nothing has replaced that belief
Christianity has its faults but at least its an ideology that pushes people to behave in a moral way and truly concern themselves with the welfare of others
I think that, if this corona crisis has shown anything, it's that while it's easy for people to profess a sense of benevolence toward others, there really is nothing compelling people to actually act in a conscientious way (as so many people breaking quarantine has shown)
I have issues with the fact that, ultimately, Christians arguably only behave decently because they're forcibly compelled by the threat of eternal damnation, but it seems like the most people don't have anything better to push them
Honestly, not a lot of people would care from a societal standpoint
Although the government does have laws that can indict you for “hurting the feelings of religious people”
He's a crab, or a gnome
Putin is no joke
Don't forget that Lenin was a mushroom
But what about"Paiy toxes" meme
Context of Belarusian having Ў/W and of their g sounding like h and sometimes wholly silent helps
"Ya pahal kak rab na galerah" Putin
Kak rab(like a slave) kak krab (like a crab)
Doesn't rly look gnomy
he is smol
And Stalin was a babyeater
Still is
Lmao same
Phahahah
Пхахаха is a common way to express laughter in Russian
The dude just put it into Latin script
German (my father has a small collection of German books, it would be great to be able to read them), Swedish (I'd like to visit Sweden once) and
maybe Japanese (a lot of memes I encounter have Japanese symbols, idk why) or Korean (one of my favourite YouTube channels is in Korean, some videos have subtitles while some don't)
Japanese - sounds awesome, useful
for things and travel to Japan
Italian - sounds awesome, less useful, but who cares, mamma mia is life
Spanish - sounds great, quite useful too, I want to read Gabito in original so much, it probably is awesome
You win
Отличный выбор (:
Yeah that "usefulness" was in my view for myself
I really don't like the sound of German and would like to avoid it if I could - and Spanish in my case could serve that role
I think most are still standing
From what I can tell, almost every town has Lenin statues standing, and I think they either should be removed completely or replaced by a statue of someone more relevant
My town has 2 of these: one in front of, what I think, was a factory entrance (now it's just 4 shops), and one on the main square (which is named Square of the Revolution lol)
The former is really ugly and should be just demolished, and the latter, while not ugly, is still irrelevant, and should be replaced by a statue to someone relevant, and the square renamed
Other cases should be decided individually
Most of them are standing, even purely communist propaganda ones (like Lenin's statues)
Big cities like Moscow and StPetersburg removed most of them and renamed many streets, but smaller towns didn't bother
By now i don't think many people are troubled by them - they are more known as landmarks, not for their meaning
As for other countries, i think Axis countries should keep them as punishment and the reminder, while countries like Baltics, Poland and Czechia can do whatever they want with them
Lenin first captured his country, killed all capitalism in Russia, shot the President and his entire family, came cattle, began to pinch the intelligent people: doctors, scientists, and so on
They took apartments from people who were successful with their minds and gave them to the proletarian
The collective farmers were easily deceived, they were stupid and illiterate, they believed in the idea of a prosperous country
The corrupt officials took over all the factories
They broke up the churches and drowned the priests
Then they added half of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and a lot of others
They set their own rules, arranged exile to Siberia
The consequences are colossal
Modern Russia is now against the Communists, this can clearly be seen from the history books and how the media present it
Real bandits came to power
Have you seen Stalin
He was jailed 5 times before the revolution for hooliganism and only 1 for political reasons
Because of this bandit in power, the Victims of Communist terror were ~11
1 million people
BUT There are many old patriots left
of course, there are Lenin monuments in every city, and I live on a street named "Karl Marx". Open any Soviet song and there will be hundreds of comments: "OH, THAT WAS OUR CHILDHOOD AS I WANT TO RETURN TO THE OLD SOVIET TIMES SO WELL LIVED
" People did not see anything around, there was a small selection of Soviet products on store shelves, many people lived closely and not alone in apartments
The country was closed
Everyone was against religion, but they worshipped Lenin
The country was ruled by corrupt officials, they could buy cars and apartments without queues and without problems, such a luxury an ordinary person could not afford
on the other hand, any ordinary worker could buy what he wanted in the store, before standing in line for 3 hours
There was free education, the best in the world by the way, objectively speaking, free universities, one of the best Sciences in the world, everyone could afford to go to a restaurant, to the cinema, pre-booking of course, because there were huge queues everywhere
As for the second world war, we can safely say that the USSR really defeated fascism, 41 million people from the USSR died
If not this country, Hitler would have captured at least the whole of Europe and most likely you would not be able to write this message here now
Objectively and incorruptibly speaking, the Soviet citizens suffered the most from the second world war, they showed Hitler where his place is and you can see this even by going to Wikipedia
How is Lenin not relevant to our history
Definitely should've said that differently
He's relevant, but relevant for the whole country, and not some village in Vologda oblast in particular
Imo, in towns we should put statues of someone who was important for this specific town, not the whole country
Nikolay I, he united the 5 villages into one town in 1844
They didn’t “lose” the Cold War
They agreed to democratize and dissolved
> will soon lose the new economic war again
I've been hearing that for 6 years already
Fat bait, 10/10
Well then we’ll install a huge statue in front of your capitol building
You guys are too inept to defeat the Ottomans yourselves so this will be a partial payment for our services
I went to a pub in Berlin around lunchtime, was almost the only customer there
Sat a couple of minutes and had no idea how stuff worked
in the end I walked over to the bar with the intention of asking if I should order there onl- "Go back to your table, we'll come to you to take your order
Oh, okay
A couple months later I found myself in Vienna with my best friend
We went to a pub and I told him we should stay put and wait for the barman to come to us
After an age, we finally did go to the bar and asked if we should order there "Of course
" "Oh right, sorry, I was just in Berlin recently and there we had to stay seated
" **"You are not in Berlin
**"
Lovely bunch, them Germans
What if the other chap is a twat and that's why the barman skipped him
We were taught about "continents" and "parts of the world". The continents are Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Australia and Antarctica
The parts of the world are the same except America is one part of the world and Europe & Asia are two parts of the world
I don't know if this is in line with the scientific consensus, if there is one
For Russia it is like this:
* Eurasia
* Africa
* North America
* South America
* Australia
* Antarctica
Yeah, I've also seen the same answers from Ukraine and Estonia
They still teach it that way, I graduated from high school just a few years ago
Not so good, lots of underground and overground crosswalks that were built in 00s and 10s. In Moscow things getting better and there coming more bike paths and but can’t tell for the rest of Russia
Moscow has quite many bike lanes, but they are poorly integrated with each other and the rest of the city
Motorists and pedestrians often disrespect them
I believe it's even worse in other cities (like in my hometown there isn't such a thing as a "bike lane" at all, neither is there in most other cities)
We have a nice bike renting scheme where you have stations all over the city and you can take a bike at one station and return it at any different one
It costs somewhere between 12-20€ for the whole season (1 April – 1 November)
Depending on the plan, you have to pay extra if you're using the same bike over 30/45/60 minutes (if you check it at a station and then take it again, you won't have to pay)
So it's pretty convenient
They also have electric bikes which are nice
But ordinary bikes are too heavy, which is a downside for me
Non existent in my city, decent in Moscow, at least in comparison
I'd say Moscow is good for fitness cycling, passable for utility cycling (the majority of the cyclists I see are food delivery couriers), terrible for commuting
Our commuting bike lanes are shoehorned into the existing road network and do not form a connected network of their own
We also get six month of brown slush every year
My teammate actually used to commute to work before the virus, but he did that only during the warmer half of the year and had to share the road with cars for a significant part of the route
From my mother's side: my mother, grandmother, uncle and his girlfriend
We are very conforming to one person's behaviour: we all used to pig out on large amounts of food until my mother started going to the gym and eating healthy
They used to drink alcohol until I became a "grown-up" teenager who was offered to drink but never did
Innocent conversations quickly slip into a not-so-polite debate club about politics, conspiracy theories and other bs
(I've had ENOUGH of this in the light of the current circumstances, lol)
By the end of the night, everyone agrees on some compromise
The food is always great, but, as I said above, everything is in moderation
From my father's side: my father, grandmother, aunt, step-brother, his other grandmother
Happily binge-eating on the innumerable number of dishes grandma has made and having mild conversations about how everyone is doing
Rinse and repeat, nothing remarkable (except the food)
"Косил косой косой косой" (cockeyed rabbit mowed with braid) this sentence can be used to distinguish who can speak russian and who use translator
Translate it please, а то даже я нихера не понял
Gotcha
No Astrid Lindgren
Edit: uh, maybe she isn't historical figure, but Bamse is
When I was in Cuba, it was a group of Canadians who emerged as the main drunken arseholes of the hotel, with one jumping from the roof when he got high on God-knows-what
Meanwhile the Russians were all well-behaved
Really messed with me, considering the stereotypes
My Russian student came back from Denmark saying it was a paradise
Would you like me to get rid of him before he can tell anyone else
I do enjoy it hands down, but that has nothing to do with English specifically
I'd feel the same way about being able to speak any other language that isn't my native
Learning to speak another language and seeing your progress is a very rewarding experience
I genuinely enjoy linguistics, reading about languages, their structure and their history, and studying peculiarities of languages, so I enjoy both Russian and English
I think I like Russian more because my understanding of it is better
But I also feel like I write better in English than in Russian, simply because I have significantly more experience writing in English professionally
My Russian texts come out heavy and clumsy, and I don't like it
Perhaps I don't notice that my English texts are just as bad
I believe it's common to feel that your native language is more emotional than any of the languages you've learned later in life, which are often seen as more rational and concise, regardless of the language
There have been some studies about this, I can look up a link if you want
Though when it comes to translations, it will also depend on how the translator has done their job
It can be done in Russian, but you have to attach a verbal suffix, and it often doesn't sound as eloquent as in English, although there might be plenty of examples when it does
Yeah, French spelling is so consistent that *mars*, *août*, *os*, *fils*, *seconde*, *esque* and (at least) hundreds of other words
Oh, wait, do you know which rule dictates to pronounce those the way they are
Holy shit this video is so good
English language sounds kinda thin and dry whereas Russian sounds
thicker
There's been quite a lot of research into emotional distance from one's non-native language and related topics
For example, Keysar et al
(2012) examined how the language of communication affects risk based decision making and found that people tend to make more rational decisions in their L2 (non-native language) compared to L1 (native language), in which their decisions are affected by biases and emotions to a greater extent
The L1/L2 groups examined were English/Japanese, Korean/English, English/French, and English/Spanish
Another study by Costa A et al
(2014) resulted in similar findings with regards to moral dilemmas; the participants were English/Spanish, Korean/English, English/French, English/Hebrew, and Spanish/English bilinguals
A different work by Colbeck et al
(2012) compared how native English speakers and native Chinese, non-native English bilinguals perceived taboo words in English, and found that non-native speakers experienced less emotional triggers compared to native English speakers
And my favourite jam: Dewaele, Jean-Marc
(2011) discovered that highly proficient bilinguals and multilinguals tend to perceive their L1 as emotionally stronger and prefer it to their L2s to express emotions and participate in highly emotional interactions; the participants were of many different backgrounds and L1/L2(/L3
) combinations
All of those papers also contain references to the relevant literature as well if you're interested
That said, given the statistical nature of such investigations, they don't *prove* that attaining a native-like level of emotional engagement in one's L2 is impossible, but they do demonstrate that not having done so is normal and doesn't really depend on the particular languages involved

I'm not sure what you mean by English sentences being packed with information
Are you talking about various grammatical constructions like articles that are absent in Ukrainian and Russian
In this case, the distinction can often be inferred from context or clarified by using certain words or rephrasing the whole sentence altogether ("...жил *один/некий* мужичок", "... *тот* мужчина...", etc
At the same time, there are devices present in Ukrainian and Russian that English doesn't have, like the distinction between perfective and imperfective verbs ("делать" vs "сделать")
Again, in English, the difference is often irrelevant, can be inferred from context, or specified lexically
I don't think it's a problem
If you mean that there aren't so many ways to tweak an English sentence and make it quirkier, I tend to disagree with this
English is very well known for its wealth of synonyms expressing certain nuances and associations
It's just that as non-native speakers, we might not be aware of them because a lot of those are rarely used, similar to how non-native speakers of Russian generally wouldn't know expressions like "с придурью".
I do agree that the choices made by a translator have a huge impact on how we regard the resulting text, but that works in both directions, not only from English to Russian
"That never happened before, and here we go again"
"Better to be the head of a fly, than ass of an elephant"
"You should think, what you understand" and others from Russian politic Chernomyrdin
The Smolensk Kremlin
Built in the very beginning in the 17th century to protect Russian western borders from the looming war with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it js the longest fortress wall in Russia (though some parts of the wall have been destroyed through the centuries)
The fortress held the Polish army for 2 years from attacking Moscow
Actually, it even played its role during the Napoleonic invasion of 1812, though its construction that had gotten outdated by that time and therefore the Kremlin wasn't really important
Today it is one of the symbols of Smolensk
However, unfortunately, the authorities are more busy with embezzlement and other schemes today, so the Kremlin is in bad condition
I hope that someday they will at least try to maintain it
If not, then I am afraid for it
It’s a relatively new building, but it’s notable
I’m taking about the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg
It stands on the former site of the Ipatiev House, also known as the place where the Romanovs were executed
I'm from Vyborg
That's basically the name of the Swedish castle the city was built around
I think the castle was built in 1286 and it's logically a main attraction
I guess Czar Nick was late to the industrial party huh
Did they sell Poland out along with the Targowica nobles
Yes, of course
It happened during the war, but the wall didn't play any role in it, naturally
The era was different
It was not more than other architectural sights for the combatants, I guess
Plus, Napoleon destroyed most parts of the wall when he retreated from Smolensk in the end of 1812
What is left makes a good accomplishment for the city centre
P.S. what offensive could possibly be in your reply
it's nothing to worry about
Yeah
Well, I am telling about the fortress and it was also constructed for war
Everything is connected to war :D
Actually, it's quite true
Each time someone attacked Russia, they had to go through Smolensk to get to Moscow, so it is a miracle that the wall still stands
Well, it's either one depending on its size and purpose
Molot is more like a Mjolner-sized, big hammer
Molotok is your usual construction tool
I make 130,000 rubles ($1,700) in Moscow at 25
&#x200B;
Realistically, I should be saving around 25-33% of that if I rented a room in one of the outer neighbourhoods, did not party too much and was rational with my spending
&#x200B;
However, I live 20 minute walk from the Kremlin, party a lot, Russian girls don't pay for themselves and have takeaway every day so I save very little (maybe 10-15k a month)
&#x200B;
One of my goals is to become more financially responsible - aim is to start seriously dating and settle down
Trying to save 400-500 euros per month
Sometimes I wonder why didn’t i start saving when I was younger, now I realize how much it’s important

Moscow is essentially a western city when it comes to living standards
If gets called churka then he must be not Russian ethnically and sadly racism between the different ethnicities inside the federation can be quite high

Most people dislike Moscow due to the focus it gets from the government whilst provincial cities stay in a state of disrepair
Way too many ppl in the north and several million deaths if it happens in winter
Nothing, because in Russia southern people aren't different from northern people

Russian government: Crimea is now fully part of the federation

HOI 4 gang
Don't know specifically about the Baltics, but in the former Soviet republics, there are a few older people who feel nostalgic about the USSR
Spoke with one elderly gentleman from Caucasus who told me "Why would you take such a great system
and just get rid of it
" I imagine for the older people, mass privatization was also quite a shock
A lot of them struggled to adjust ever since
People who grew up in the 60s-80s did not experience gulags or genocide the way the ones in the early years did
Yup
Like immigrants, poor people, minorities, gays, etc
When the economy goes down, just blame one of these groups and you will still get votes
I prefer it al dente but I don't get this Italian butthurt when foreigners don't do this
Yeah, I guess it's healthier than some mushy pasta, but we don't eat every food in the healthiest way possible, right
Or when they tell you that you can't break spaghetti apart because "it's long for a reason". That's just some bullshit snobbery to me
I started cooking it al dente after visiting Italy and I love it more than mushy because it gives texture and is chewy
At the same time in Rome it was too al dente for my taste
I heard it different regionally and Roman's pasta is the hardest
Is it true
Al dente on steroids
Eastern spy detected
The speculation is that it takes longer to digest, therefore it keeps you full for a longer period and you don't have to overeat
> butchering the French language, or making a weird version of the American flag
Or citing russian literature all wrong
But people don't claim to make their pasta the Italian way
they just take some noodles and cook them their own way, without saying that it's "basically the same as in Italy".
I was so ignorant, thanks for enlightening me
What's the reason for this judgment I don't get
It will still be long and have the same consistency if I break it into to equal parts
I suppose you'd be hungry sooner when you eat mushy pasta
That makes sense, but I just don't claim to make an Italian dish
Everything except the fourth sound like Russia
Yes, I've stumbled upon some "Spelling bee" videos on Youtube
I've never seen anything like that in Russian
And it makes sense, as the differences between spelling and pronunciation are much more noticeable in English
Russian has its own quirks which may cause you to misspell a word, but it's more or less a phonetic language
Ain’t that a familiar feeling
good joke, mate
Moscow - is not Russia, money go there to die, inhabited by entitled rich pricks which are permanently busy and running somewhere and think that there is no life outside of Ring road, also they say Maaaaskva;
Saint Petersburg - Cultural Capital, Window to Europe and Land of Porebriks, inhabited by eccentric snobs, art connoisseurs and alcoholics, every Petersburgian homeless person will quote Pushkin and Dostoyevsky to you while asking for a sigarette; the weather is awful & never ending rain;
Siberia - very cold and everyone is tough and stoic and has very strong health (because people with weak health simply don't survive);
Kazan' - nice, old, inhabited by Tatars;
Kuban' - heat, sea, watermellons, everyone will be very friendly and will try to use you for their profit;
Russian Far East - nature is stunning, cheap caviar and everyone is going to China/Korea/Japan for vacations because it's cheaper and faster than traveling to Moscow
Exactly, lol
Isn't it as easy as if you're living near the Canadian/Mexican border
As an american (citizen of US, actually) you live in confederation, transformed into a country
European Union is kinda quasi-confederation too, but with much more independency in it's countries
So, basically, imagine that driving from state to state is almost the same as from country to country
Judging by the lack of pages in most European languages, a [multicooker]
UPD: Oh, and a "zavaroćnyj" teapot, a small china teapot where you brew your concentrated tea *zavarka*. Then you add *zavarka* to your cup and dilute it with hot water from a kettle/samovar
It's becoming somewhat popular in Russia lately
Our old flat from the 1980's came with socket protectors on all sockets: they were sprung discs that you had to rotate 90° to align the holes in them with the socket
And a bottle scraper to get every drop you've paid for
Stews and porridges, mostly
Pulled pork
Clotted cream and yoghurt
It's too small for cooking soup for the whole family, otherwise I would use it for soups as well
Many countries in Europe restrict the types of knives you can carry: no locks in England, no one-handed opening in Germany and so on
In Russia anything under 3
5"/9cm is legal, even if it's a fully-automatic OTF double-edged knife
It's more of an electric pot with temperature control
Writing letters on paper and sending them in envelop by post
Also postcards are dying (or maybe dead)
Vodka and spirits are becoming less popular than wine and bear
OMG, Russia has most users and they're second to Germany on postcards sent qty
Very much surprising, thanks
The good news that such road is not in the mountains and there is no precipice at the other side =) Otherwise, things are getting even more complicated
Kalinka is a very popular instantly recognizable Russian folk song
Also katyusha
Monica Zetterlund is the essence of Sverige
Новгород (Newtown) is one of the oldest places in Russia
Lol if you translate Nevada from Russian you’ll get grammatically incorrect “no water”
Saint-Petersburg definitely is the most foreign because it's an old European city, built by European architects on Royal money
Everything else is pretty typical in of itself I'd say, except Moscow, obviously, because of country centralised nature
Old parts of Kaliningrad is also note worthy but it *is* an old German city, converted basically
Saint Petersburg
It’s basically a mishmash of European cities quite unlike any other
Petersburg stands out in architecture only
And only in the historical imperial center of the city
Everything else is more or less the same as in any other big Russian city
I have been to some, outside of several religious buildings here and there I wouldn't say there is a major difference
It might be different in smaller villages I'd say but we are talking about major (relative to local area) urban centers
I am from Kalmykia myself and would not say that Elista is significantly different *as a city*
(But maybe I misunderstood the question a bit)
No argument here
For Eastern Europe I lean to "should". Russian is by far the most popular Slavic language, as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations
On the other hand, most Slavic languages are already more or less mutually intelligible
For the entire Europe — hell no
Russian grammar is very hard for foreigners, and all these cases, genders and conjugations will be as much of pain in the ass for them as English tenses and articles are for me (Russian language only has four tenses, and that's if you count full and short future forms as different tenses since they use different grammar, and it doesn't have articles)
Serbian people, what script do you mostly use, Latin or Cyrillic
All these results make me sad, our serbian brothers are switching to the evil side (joking)
It’s not so hard to use cyrillic, guys, it’s just your habit
Cyrillic alphabet is cool and special
We used to use latin for Russian only when there was no cyrillic available for websites in 90s, now 99,99% of russian web is in cyrillic and only our immigrants in other countries who don’t have russian keypad may type in latin
Our keyboards have 2 letters – Cyrillic and Latin – shown on each key, so you don't have to memorise them specifically
Selling of Alaska mb
Going communist
Invading Chechnya, but not technically an invasion as it was already part of the country
I'm not too familiar with pre-Enlightment Europe, what exactly did the Teutonic Order do
Wasn't it a group of knights
Had no choice during WWII as the Germans would’ve annihilated you like they did to Serbia
The fact that you protected so many Jewish people is impressive and deserves international recognition
Are you sure that it was like
Latvia: hmm, will we give it away or not
USSR: Please, I beg you, pleeeease
Latvia: hmmm, I will think about it, but who knows
USSR: Pleeeease
I stand on knees
Latvia: Well, uuf, ok, take it for some time
Not like you had much of a choice, USSR could do anything it wanted especially as it was during wartime
Who knows
Not that bad for Russia, but very bad for the Caucasus and Central Asia
Russians don't need Istanbul
"Prussia which played a key role in the destruction of Polish-Lithuanian Union"
And then lead to some very very very bad things happening centuries later down the road
Fox, meet henhouse
It's not that close tho
For example, we still have Kamchatka which is just a bit further from US than Alaska
The reason to keep Alaska is the wealth of this land, but you know, who knew how it would've turned out
Russia has lost wars before; even if what you're saying is right, what would make you think this would be different
If Russia should've been killed by another country, it would be Polandlithuania (one of the most egalitarian and advanced countries in Europe who sought to include Russia as a core country) or France (ditto, it's a continent-wide tragedy that Napoleonic France lost)
In both cases Moskva was taken
Yes I feel very bad for the other soviet republics, they really got screwed over
Compared to places like Czechia and Slovakia which emerged from the ruins of communism smelling of roses
From Los Angeles
Are you sure that's the primary target
The primary targets are located in the East of the US
&#x200B;
Em, and btw I wasn't talking about military, Idk why you start talking about it
Because Russia is not only a big Putin armed with bombs and ready to destroy the world
We live here and we want to live a good life
Thus, we need money
That's the thing
Well, ok, it would benefit in military way
Im just saying it's not the only reason
But ok, I agree that it could've changed the way the world is developing now
We already share a border with Mongolia and Belarus, why would we benefit from bordering with another small country
Given that where I live humidity is often high during winter it's hard to pinpoint the "cold" range, it can be even above 0 sometimes
Freezing: below -10C
Cold: +5 to -10C
Chilly: +5 to +18C
Nice: +18 to +25C
Warm: +25 to +28C
Hot: +28C and above
Tend to agree with minor differences
\+35 hell for you
For YOU
You're fucking live in hell
Same
Wow, I know which flag I will choose for the next question "which flag you like the most"?
Im not, but same here
I live at 55°N and lack of sun is worse part of winter for me
I'm OK with cold weather when it's  sunny
I live at 56° and I absolutely detest this half of the year for this
I have a friend in Murmansk, it's currently a polar night there, his answer:
"A lot of people complaining about it, but personally I don't care because I spend whole *day* in the office
And I love polar day because I can cycle at *night*."
So, people just used to it, I guess
Sun sets before 4 pm (15:48 today) where I live
I'm more concerned about cold weather and overall hrash climate than daylight hours
Alcohol
At least you have warm Gulfstream
The most recent one is the Soviet industrialization
So, the first five-year plan was proposed in 1927 and most plants were operational by 1933
Of course, a lot of them were bought in the USA, but no one has disassembled steelworks and car factories just sitting around waiting for a buyer
Especially for a buyer who needs everything in metric
So either the writers of the show had no idea how hard it is to design and build multiple heavy industry plants from scratch, or they had to retcon a lot of negotiations with the US in the 20's.
That's an oddly specific phrase lol
You got it almost right, it's "mochevoj puzyr", but there's "mocheispuskatelnyj kanal", which means "urinary tract".
But honestly, if I heard a foreigner say any of these albeit a bit wrong, I'd be so impressed and probably very confused that I wouldn't even notice it
Getting back to your question, it's not really a foreign language, and the word is pretty widespread, but oh well
I don't speak Tatar at all, but my friend was impressed that I know what "quraq bash" is
It means "dickhead" btw
Absolutely right
Idk why i like Sheffield United [logo]
For Moscow, if you're walking around the historic part of the city, I'd say Kak Upoitelny v Rossii Vechera
For Sankt Peterburg
Honestly would associate Paris the most with the soundtrack from Amelie or something
Survival in stressful
Total hospitality when guests are around
Filthy gabbers :)

Many people don't care, but I a cousin of mine was fined some 5 years back, and a friend a couple of weeks ago
Thats not it
Яжемать is an entitled woman
But its not the same as helicopter parenting
> Haven't met a "яжеотец/yazheotets" (but-I'm-a-father) yet
It definitely appears in google, but I personally haven't heard it before either
I think it's flexible
Короче яжемать считает что ей все должны.
А речь идет про сюсюкание с ребенком в итоге которого получается беспомощное избалованное говно
Helicopter parenting is not about the mother
Living in Moscow, I've never been to  Palace of Facets, Armory Chamber and other museums inside the Kremlin, shame on me
I think they won't close anytime soon, so I still have a chance (and maybe that's a reason - I think I always have time so maybe next time)
But I've been to inside Lenin Mausoleum, that was by pure chance and unplanned beforehand, I just found myself on the Red Square and decided to check if it's still open and voila -- it was
Maybe 15 years ago or so
Did you know its spire is 123m tall
We have a counting aid like that
We usually say «Один и-и-и, два и-и-и, три и-и-и...», which means «One a-a-and, two a-a-and, three a-a-and
» and so on
They also use similar aid in the army to count down 3 seconds and synchronize volleys: «Три-и-иста, три-и-идцать, три!» or «Three hundred thirty three». [1:24]
Neither do we, just pausing between numbers
I'd recommend to go for STEM degrees
And not only because there is demand, but also because Russian education in social sciences and the humanities is lackluster in comparison
Russia actually has one of the best STEM educations
From my perspective as a theoretical physicist (and a person still involved in higher education, to some degree), yes, Russia is competitive in my area of science
Russian education in physics excels at theoretical physics and its mathematical foundations in particular, but the experimental base might be subpar due to the lack of funding; most top-notch labs are still in the West
The education is also somewhat lacking in other aspects important to my profession, like giving public speeches, writing, English language, team collaboration and so on, I often find foreign students and scientists more competent in these areas
Top Western universities also usually offer better work contacts from the get-go
But overall, Russian graduates from top universities are a welcome addition to the scientific groups in most countries
Yeah, lack of funding
everybody knows why
What a waste with the potential we have
Good caviar
It's impossible to find in my experience outside of Russia
I love saunas, I am from Russia and now live in the U.S and I struggle with the lack of saunas even in hotels =(
We do it as well
We call it "riga", I wonder if it's a Finnic or a Slavic word
To be honest, writing about flavor is like writing about what sex feels like
You could try but you'll never do it justice
Suffice it to say though that good caviar is nearly always served fresh so it's less salty, has a divine texture and pops in your mouth
Goes great with crackers lol
Yes we do have wooden cabins (we call them banya) and saunas very popular in Russia
I just noticed literally everything I said after the sex comparison could be read as a string of euphemisms
Yay me
Sami oppression was bad but gone by the late 1800s wasn't it
It didn't really affect many folk anyway since noone ever lived in Sapmi anyway
At most we're talking 100k folk (there're about 30k Sami nowadays)
> Co-founders of eugenics
Rome would like a word
Honestly I looked this up and I don't really see how Sweden played a role
Maybe 1 Swede was involved
I don't think you can really fault Sweden for much in that
> During the Commonwealth days our Nobility had a nasty pass time of forcibly Polonizing the Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians
Like Iwan said this isn't really true
Most Belarusians who care hate the concentration camps in Interwar Poland which disproportionately targeted Belarusians
Not sure if they targetted Ukrainians, as well
Frankly medieval Polandlithuania is something many Belarusians eagerly identify with over Russian empire, and it's understandable why with all the civilities of Polandlithuania
Also let's not forget communist Poland
What about on both
No deal in Russia
You just go and buy any random scissors
Well, we would need to prepare yet again for a new invasion
From Russia with "ah shit here we go again"
I would be getting invaded
> bomb
Now, with radioactive fallout and 16 times the detail
And majority of Russians are really looking forward to burning down Moscow again anyway
Слыш, это международный ресурс епта, фильтруй базар
Dear French, wish to inform you about the internationality of this site
Funny how you really think both Hitler and Napoleon failed solely because of cold weather
And that'll be your fatal mistake
You'll all die of heat strokes
With winters like this, slippers and towels are better suited for the invasion of Moscow
Police of humor has arrested you
I don't know if that's how Ukrainians think about it, but from a Russian perspective pelmeni (dumplings) ≠ vareniki, so the answer is "we don't have dumplings with fruit fillings". The truth is we actually have them, only we call them differently
Haha, no problem
In Russia, at least where I live, we have both pelmeni and vareniki
The primary difference between the two is in the shape of the shell: vareniki look like [this] and pelmeni like [this]
Traditionally, pelmeni are filled with ground meat, and vareniki with fruits/jams, potatoes, cottage cheese, or just herbs
However, that's not what really makes them "different dishes". What makes them different is the shape
If you use a "wrong" filling with a vareniki-shaped dumpling, it will still be considered vareniki, and vice versa with pelmeni
And I've actually seen vareniki with meat
Also we have [lazy vareniki] that are different from both vareniki and pelmeni, and they don't have any fillings
I hope I didn't overwhelm you
That's my sloppy typing, and google corrected it anyway
I’ll go inside and order something from the menu, if the kitchen is closed (shouldn’t be, 11:45 is too early for that) there would be plenty 24/7 cafes or restaurants, burgers are probably my favorite, sushi as a second choice
Mexican also good but hard to find
It depends on where I am, after four beers there's huge chances I'd sneak into another bar close by and order whatever special they have
But if I'm really have to go, I'd get a shawarma or a burger
It's definitely [Saint Basil's Cathedral]
Actually, it is almost the same place
I’d say it defines a western style of life
Not a European one
And the USA maybe even more in it than Europe
Yeah, but you can also become 300% European if you feed your dog with dog meat
> Are there wildlife and trees growing
Google "Chernobyl virtual tour".
Yeah you don’t want to fuck with Belarusian authorities
There're some three hundred years when we were not free
1480 (Mongol-Tatar yoke was lifted completely) - 1605 (it's complicated, but basically Poland tried to get Russia under itself), 1612 (poles were expelled from Moscow and the rest of the country by the Second Volunteer Army) onwards
Tsardom of Russia: 1547 - 1917
Soviet union: 1922 - 1991
Modern Russian federation: 1991 - 2020+
This is pretty much the meat of it
Specifically, after the [Mongol invasion] in 13th century
Some nationalists claim 1917-1991 was an occupation as well
Well, there was no one entity and only interconnected principalities and such
Conquering them was an easy task for such a force as the Horde
Im more nationalist and can say that it was just a small reshape of the same country
Calling Soviet period "occupation" is a must to any self respecting Eastern European nationalist
It wasn't \`small\` in all meanings)
Because for them it was foreign
I don’t think the same logic applies to russians being occupied by russians (не в этническом смысле)
Paris is shit to me
Pete’s night life is the tits, and I say that as a Muscovite that used to dance the night (and brain cells) away in his rowdy youth

Have you been to Depo foodmarket at Belorusskaya metro station
As the resident fattie I highly recommend mussels with parmesan and black pepper at "Mollusca"
I tell everyone Milan is Moscow in Italy
Н is basically N and pronounced as Enn
We also have a ”soft“ version of the letter
For example, the hard Н can be heard in the word ”No” while the soft version can be heard in the word ”New”.
Everything is the same with the English N, but when we pronounce it, we put the tongue on the teeth, not above them
> while the soft version can be heard in the word ”New”.
Most native English speakers pronounce it the same way as in other positions, though
And as for the Latin letter, most people say аш/aš, like the French
Maybe Monaco
I don’t agree with them serving as a tax haven for sketchy corporations and individuals
Chechnya isnt a country
I don't get this logic, tbh
I travel to places because I want to visit their historical, cultural and natural attractions
Not because I agree or disagree with their politics which actually has very little effect on the trip
Vive l’Empereur
In Russia the law says about sensible amount of self-defence too but from what I’ve heard it’s a choice between death and sentence
My friend’s cop and he said that even they are mostly not allowed to use guns, especially for self defence
I’ve seen a lot of cops with empty holsters
We have only one police that is called police and deals with regular crimes everywhere
The National Guard, the Investigations Committee  and the FSB do their own stuff
Military police polices only the military
First year we just learn World history, then (for the remaining 5 years) World history alongside Russian history (starting from the arrival of slavs in 6th century)
What were "empires coming and falling, scientific development, literature" on the territory of USA
Afaik only central and southern Americas had centralized states, while territory of USA was inhabited by tribal societies with development level similar to European bronze age
In Russia we learn about every single president
It’s easy because we’ve only had 2
In their life, it would depend on many things
But after their deaths their heirs would have inherited both countries and it would depend then on their wishes and tendencies in countries
If heirs decided to unite them, then why not
Btw [
I was 17 when I finished school and 18 when started university (my birthday is in summer btw)
I guess it's the most common age, but I also have a coursemate who started uni at 16, though she's a rare case
When I graduated we had 10 years of school, so I started at 6 and graduated at 16
These days parents are not in a hurry to send kids to school, so they start at 7, and since 2001 everyone has to spend 4 years in primary school, not 3 like me, so kids will graduate at 18 if they turn 8 during the first grade
What if you finish school before 18 because you, say, started earlier
Or does that never happen
Our system is 11 years of school, normally starting at the age of 6-7, although I know people who went to school at 5 or 8
Omsk is a short form of Omskaya Krepost'(Omsk Fortress)
Omskaya because it is on river Om'. The name "Om'" according to one version comes from the Turkic word om - "quiet".
Kostroma city has a Slavic origin, related to Russian костёр(bonfire, brome grass), there is also East Slavic deity named Kostromá.
Moscow/Moskva <- grad Moskov <- river Moskva/Mosky
The name has a disputed etymology, is likely Baltic in origin, as Galindians lived there before the Slavs
If it's Baltic, then it probably means something like "marshy, waterlogged".

In my country the best and most expensive is Moscow State University
There a lot of good universities but I can’t mention them
I don’t remember all of them
I can say about my university
Pyatigorsk State University
It’s the on the top 10 of the best linguistic universities
> Far Eastern Federal Univeristy
Nahh
They have a cool student society, but the university itself is a victim of the "optimization" of higher education in my opinion
> because Baltika Kaliningrad and FC Luch Vladivostoka are in the same league :o
I was so disappointed Baltika didn't perforn bad enough to be demoted to PFL
Just imagine someone with a World Cup-level stadium competing with teams whose stadium is a muddy puddle
Is switching to the standard dialect something people do or can be asked to do in your country
Someone wrote on another website that a Bavarian will try speaking Hochdeutsch with a foreigner, but asking a person from Manchester to speak RP is unthinkable

Implemented
They *should be* the same, not *should be made* the same
* [Pelmeni] usually filled with ground meat
* [Vareniki] (the same as Polish pierogi, but this word means "pies" in Russia)
Stuffed with potatoes, jams, cottage cheese or even just herbs
Even though the traditional fillings are different, the primary difference between the two kinds of dumplings is the shape
If it's shaped like pelmeni but has a "wrong" filling, it'll still be (weird) pelmeni
Also with [quark] It's a good lactovegetarian substitute for meat dumplings
I have some in my freezer
Wow
Thank you, I remembered that I have a lot of food in my freezer
Pelmeni is THE student food with smetana

Same here pal
Vladimir Puti
wait, there is FSC at my door
Putin
It's easy, Putin
He is not even alive now
Older generations are blinded by propaganda, they love and trust Putin
So yes, most people like him
They see him as the "saviour of Russia", even though he and his people steal a lot of money and many people are very poor
Probably because russians are submissive, most of us are descendants of slaves . We've never had democracy too
First tsars and emperors, then dictators
I guess Yeltsin counts as democracy, but those weren't the best times
Here it's rock, scissors, paper
The rock blunts the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper wraps up the rock
Also for some reason we often had the "scissors first" rule: everyone makes scissors on the first round, and then we had a second round that was the real one
No idea why we did that
Personally, I spend about 175€ /month
I don't cook at home, I eat mainly in cafes and restaurants
In supermarkets I buy only semi-finished products, meat, milk, cheese and something like that
The cost of food in a family of 4 persons will be lower
About 425 €/month in my city
I spend up to 150 EUR
Usually I buy grains (buckwheat, rice, bulgur, pea, pearl barley, lentil) and pasta when I find it on sales, chicken, eggs, veggies, rarely fruits
I gave up buying cheese because edible ones are too expensive for me
The problem here Russians spend 30% of the salary on food
Or even 50% for poor people
In my region average salary is 480 euro and median salary is 400 euro
Prices mostly +-5-7% as in Europe (I checked prices in Germany this year)
I don’t count how much I spend on food
I think that people should eat what he wants and don’t be thrifty when it comes to food
Well, today I ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and vegetables
It cost 130₽.
Very cheap, is that kinda cantina in a university
If I cooked the same dish at home, it would be half the price
I'm lazy af
No, this is a cafe in the city center near the university
If you have the desire and time, then you can find even cheaper
Divinely tasty shaurma of usual sizes costs 100₽, a large 150₽.
It's almost like communist countries were different
I heard really good stories about Tito's Yugoslavia
Really interested by it, seems like a much more eficient version of the USSR
Even by commieblock standarts Ceaușescu was cruel idiot
Dude didn't realise Stalin times are over
I met some older people who lamented that it disappeared
One older gentleman told me "why would you take something so great
and ruin it"
And tbf for some countries, it took them until the late 2000s to reach the same living standards they had during the USSR, like Russia for example
If you lived in Russia between 1991 and 2005, you arguably had it worse than during the late USSR years
Where in Croatia do you live
Yugoslavia definitely seemed like the best socialist nation at the time
Life in the USSR was significantly worse
The downside of Yugoslavia is that it relied on Tito to survive
I (think I) can get by with Russian in all of the ex-USSR, probably in other Slavic countries and maybe in the tourist-y areas all around Europe
It's possible to get by in Slavic countries if the other person is open to establishing rapport with you
Otherwise you would have to stick to some tourist areas in Turkey, Egypt, Thailand or some parts of Spain
Practically anywhere in Central, and Eastern Europe and parts of central Asia
I think that nowhere
Don’t think that anybody will be able to understand me
Yeah, but it requires both parties to be motivated
It's especially easy when Russian is a common language in a country
Plenty of Russian tourists go to Georgia, they get by somehow
Unlike Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia also have something like a quarter of their inhabitants being native Russian speakers
It's extremely easy to get by with just Russian in Tallinn from what I've seen
Certainly in touristy places even the native Estonians will often have some knowledge of Russian
A couple of times natives ended up switching to Russian with me after they understood that I was from Russia, even though I started out speaking in English for politeness sake
That's not true, most of Russians study only one foreign language: English
Well, maybe these Russians ended up in Germany exactly because they learned German :)
It was available in my school, but only 5 people out of ~100 in my year studied it
And it's not available in most schools
It was more common in the Soviet Union, though
It was actually 2 out of 45 after the 9th year when most students went to college or changed school

Zootopia made me a furry back in 2016
Please tell r/yiffinhell that puppy play isn't furry, they have 2 posts on their front page with that rn
Also, their description is literally "An archive of the furry fandom at its worst
", which means that not all furries are like that
And, well, I don't really interact (as in, communicate with other ppl in it) with the fandom, I mostly just lurk r/furry_irl, and it's mostly alright
I don't like all these "all furries should be killed" kind of jokes, I know (or at least hope) that it's just a comedic overreaction, but still

What do young people think about the Transnistria issue
I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it but I loved walking alone in Moscow (center) at night, always took a chance to go on long walks after nights out around 2-5 am, never felt unsafe
But then again I was born there and know how to navigate it
Oh yeah, I’m a woman
Petersburg
I'd say biggest threats are natural: dirt, ice, puddles, potholes etc, in the dark it's harder to watch your step
Other than that you should be fine
Moscow is generally safe
This maybe not a solid cover and having holes  (i.e. big parks), but I personally would not be afraid walking on streets
Same, but I would say that everywhere in Moscow feels safe, not just the center
I used to work nightshifts so I would often go out at 1-4 am and head to the grocery store, and sometimes not to the closest one (yeah, we have lots of 24-hour supermarkets here)
I live in Bibirevo, and that's like on the very outskirts of Moscow
I can't remember being scared even once, and nothing bad ever happened to me (but that's just my experience, maybe I've just been lucky and reckless
Nice joke mate, living in Kupchino screams at night were more like a regular backdrop than something unnatural
I would avoid industrial areas and districts with a lot of migrants from southern regions
Even Nørrebro in Copenhagen
Got it, no nazi republican Jewish women in short skirts allowed

Nizhny Novgorod, Russia
A completely new 3 to 4 room apartment (~150 m^2 ) in the very center of the city, near the Kremlin
Or a 400 to 800 m^2 house depending on the location
There are some 110 sqm flats literally across the road from the Kremlin being sold for this price
There must be a catch
A 64 sqm flat in the poshest district of Moscow or a 68 sqm flat behind the Bolshoi
A 140 sqm flat in the district where I live, in perfect condition
A kremlin is just a Russian version of a castle, so many old Russian cities have kremlins
Use taxi apps, don't even try to catch a taxi by yourself, especially at airports
Avoid touristy shops in the center of Moscow or St

The Aeroexpress train has almost become a scam now
The ticket is 400 RUB per person, so if there are three of you it's 1200 RUB, you can get a taxi to your hotel for this price from SVO or VKO or just take a bus to the nearest metro/MCD station
DME is a bit further off, so the price is more reasonable
Taxi is cheap, true enough
But there are huge traffic jams in Moscow
If you don't have much time and don't want to risk, Aeroexpress is a better option

Most of the stuff I can find on Wikipedia's list of Russian dishes *is* commonly served at home or in canteens
Maybe large savoury pies
No one has time to cook them at home, and they are too boring for eating out
Karavaj, the bread they use when they welcome dignitaries with bread and salt
Various mead-like alcoholic drinks: sbitenj, medovuha
We only drink them when touring the Golden Ring
That's because America is known for it, not Italy
Sauerkraut is very popular here
I didn't know it was originally a German dish before I read it somewhere a year ago or so
Same here with vodka, which is far from being the most popular alcoholic beverage and is mainly seen as something only alcoholics drink
Also, I'm under the impression that full or partial abstinence from alcohol is more common and more socially acceptable here than elsewhere in Europe
But we don't fry it like these barbarians do
We call it "квашеная капуста", which means "soured cabbage".
Maybe, that was actually the case for me as well, though coming from my grandfather
But there could be a more general trend of people turning to a healthier lifestyle
Apparently smoking, alcohol and (other) drugs are nowhere near as popular as they were in the 90s and early 2000s.
Yes, the only cooked sauerkraut we eat can be found in soups
If it's a side dish, it's raw, crunchy sauerkraut
First world problem
In Moscow, it doesn't go below -20 often, but we had a week or so when it did just recently
At such times, yes, everything works as it should, including all public transport, deliveries, and other services
I can't answer about how difficult it is to start a car since I don't drive, but the roads are packed as usual
Regarding the clothes: I don't wear either thermal underwear or any type of sweater because I'd have to change clothes every time I get inside, and I hate changing often, so it's just my laziness
I just wear my usual pants, a warm winter coat, a scarf, and I cover my head with the hood
When outside, you tend to walk very quickly if you don't want to freeze your ass
Now, a real problem: phones do fail you when you need them the most
I had my phone shut down at 40% when I was in the middle of nowhere at 4am and had to order a taxi to get back home, and that was no fun at all
I've had it switch off on other occasions as well, but it wasn't a big problem as I was close to home
All I said applies to any temps below -10
With huge snowfalls there can be some minor disruptions in the suburban trains schedule
Other than that life just goes on
The biggest shit is black ice or when all the snow melts
Then it's huge pain in the ass (but not impossible) to walk anywhere, even the central parts of Moscow
Yeah, in Moscow it really doesn’t go below -20 often like u/sliponka said, he perfectly summed it up
One more thing is that really difficult to look at the phone screen when your eyes adapt to all the whiteness of snow around (idk if that just me though)
I don't wear gloves, just hold my hands in the pockets, and generally it's fine to take them out to use your phone as long as it doesn't take more than a minute or a few minutes
Not a very pleasant sensation but not a big deal either
A few years ago, I had either magic gloves or a phone with a particularly sensitive screen, where I could easily use the phone with the gloves on
But I'm not sure it works universally
Otherwise, yes, you'd just take off the gloves
Can't imagine how there could be ice in the bus as Moscow busses are heated rather well (and sometimes too much), but maybe you weren't lucky and caught a bus with a broken heater
Still great you enjoyed your trip, though
I guess it's quite aged, but it works fine when I'm not spending much time outside, so I'll wait until I really need it
You know, the later you update something, the later you'll have to do that again
Thank you for the advice, though
Perhaps you were in Korolyov or Zhukovsky
Those two are outside of Moscow, though, so they could easily have older busses
Code is English only
Switching between keyboard layouts every time you need to type a variable or function name would be insane and transliteration into Latin alphabet looks ugly and it's mostly used by students who just haven't learned English yet
Comments can be in Russian or English but some editors and IDEs can mess up encodings so a comment in Russian has a chance to render as an unintelligible gibberish when the code is opened with a different editor
It's always English if it's not 1C.
Always English
People who name variables and functions using transliterated Russian words suck
Comments and inline documentation, depends
If those who read them are expected to always be inside Russia, it might make sense to write it in Russian
However, if I have a choice, I write everything in English
The job itself is mostly the same as anywhere, I think
It's also one of the highest paid professions here, especially in Moscow
As for the education, it depends heavily on your specialization
We mostly studied some fundamental things like algorithm theory, computer architecture and network theory, the practical programming itself was pretty basic (but not BASIC, lol)
Yes
There's a period when hanging out with the other gender is uncool, somewhere around ages 9-14
After that socializing in mixed-gender groups is normal and fine
Having a close friend of the opposite gender is rarer, but possible
People will gossip behind your backs trying to establish if you two actually fuck or if at least one of you is gay
Your SO might also get jealous
- Allo/алло if it's my home or mobile phone and I don't know who's calling
- Da/да/yes or Слушаю/slušaju/[I'm] listening if it's my office phone and I don't know who's calling
- Привет, $callername/Privet, $callername/Hello $callername if it's someone I know
If I had to answer calls to an externally reachable number on my office phone then I would answer it like
- $companyname, ортоксерокс, чем могу помочь?/$companyname, ortokseroks, ćem mogu pomoć?/$companyname, orthoxerox, how can [I] help
“Yes
”, “Listening”, “Allo” as the most frequent
Some people have their ‘personal’ greetings, eg I often say “attentively” (the “listening” part, which comes after the adverb in Russian, is implied)
If I don’t know the person who is calling I’m going to be silent until the caller introduces him/herself
If that doesn’t happen, I end the call and block the number
Oh, boy, that's a complicated question
- Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was proclaimed on the 12th of June 1990
- however, RSFSR itself was founded on the 7th of November 1917
- but if it was a successor to the Russian Republic that was a successor to the Russian Empire that was a successor to the Russian Tsardom that was a successor to the principality of Moscow, then it's 1263, when the principality was finally given to a specific cadet branch
- however, the *grand* principality of Moscow was grand because it subsumed the grandness of its parent grand principality of Vladimir, which was split off from Pereyaslavl principality in 1125
- and of course, since the grand principality of Moscow became the only sovereign principality ruled by Rurikid princes, they could claim the heritage of the whole Old Rus, which was founded in 862 in Novgorod

We don't have any informal words for babysitters, but "nyanya", which is the usual term, appeared from children's mumbling (just like other words like "mama", "nonna", etc
in most languages)
No, because our labor classes are gendered
I wish I had
While girls had cooking and sewing, we boys had useless shit like how to operate a turning lathe
I wanted to cook and they allowed me to learn with the girls
I also liked woodwork when we had it as boys, but I hated some other courses
Dividing classes based on gender is a stupid remnant of our 'sacred values' and 'traditions' where a woman is supposed to be in the kitchen and a man at work
Some other boys wanted to cook too, but they hesitated to ask because they didn't want to 'appear effeminate'.
We also called it *технология* (technology)
This idea never crossed my mind back then
I'm fairly sure a kid would be made fun of by other kids even for asking to attend classes for the opposite gender
I also find it completely stupid and reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes
Cooking or
handling basic instruments are useful regardless of gender, and women aren't disadvantaged at being modern machine-tool operators either
Yes and Russia is very sexist
I remember one of the earlier South Park episodes had Kenny as the only boy that attended home ec instead of shop class
So even though that's pretty sexist, it's not *incredibly* outdated
Do they expect people who graduate from Gymnasiums to have domestic servants
They made jokes about my learning with the girls a couple of times, but mostly they would be friendly and say things like "it's great that at least you don't have to do that shit" or something along those lines
But all of those skills are useful for everyone, and it's a shame that I still can't sew a button properly
Mario Fernandez, football player from Brazil, received Russian citizenship some years ago and he still can't speak Russian
But he regularly scoring amazing goals for Russian national team
I personally would like immigrants to learn Russian but my wishes don't really matter
None of the migrants here do anyway
A handful of elite athletes is pretty irrelevant in the grand scale of things
As a general rule, one would still want naturalised citizens to know Russian
No, no one skips school on the first of March, but spring school holidays usually start around the end of March, so there's no reason for truancy
What is the neighborly etiquette like in your country
Is it normal to be friends with neighbors or you rather keep your distance from them
> I have the keys to pretty much ***any*** house in the street and ***they have mine***.
*(eastern european hyperventilation noises)*
Just reading this gives me anxiety
Same, but some do
I tend to think those who look for friends in neighbours are older than average redditors but it barely depends on country
This is starting to sound more and more like people in the Netherlands have some very interesting ideas about personal space and property
Lemme just pop in your house real quick
yeah over here this definitely would end in hospitalization
This is amazing to me since I grew up in a concrete human hive in a so-called “sleeping district”. No one knew each other there, except for grannies who liked to sit on the benches near the entrance
I’ve moved to a smaller (and recently built) apartment complex, we do have a chat group for communal activities (such as figuring out and scolding whoever failed to pick up their dog’s shit or is making noisy renovations outside scheduled hours, sometimes for bbq and beer), also another one for the community shared property management and maintenance issues, but I still don’t know the names of the neighbors on my floor
In fact, we barely acknowledge each other by saying “hello” and avoiding eye contact while riding the elevator together awkwardly
30 min by subway, I live right next to a station and work right next to another one
20 min walk to the station, 1 - 1,5 hr train ride and 15 min walk to the uni
3 minutes to bus stop, 8-10 minutes bus ride to the workplace (corporate shuttle) same time to go back
When the weather is fine I walk back home, takes 50-60 minutes depending on the route
7 minutes walk to metro station
5 minutes on metro
Then 5 minutes to cross the road, enter the building and take an elevator to my workplace
Not many people in Moscow are lucky to live that close to work
Semen Ang Geyorgy
Odessa mama, Rostov papa
It's actually pronounced Semyon though
It should be spelled this way too, Семён. But ё is kinda non-obligatory letter in Russian and is often replaced with e, even though they sound completely different, and Semyons had fallen victims for it
Agamemnon
Artaxerxes
Amoxiclav
It's pronounced Semyon and actually should be spelt like it but infamous letter ё often gets replaced with e in writing
It's a rather popular meme of Odessite culture
And Odessite cuture is one of the pillars of Soviet-era culture
So, there are countless places where you can see that slogan
Basically, Odessa was major port, run by volatile mix of jewish gangsters, jewish officials and jewish intelligentsia
Those three groops intersect of course
It was a great treasure which we sadly lost
Tbh, it's not the best name
Especially considering that it might be spelled in passport as Semen, lol
Yep
And common nickname is Сёма/Syoma
It's actually more of "old people's name" right now, not very frequent among younger generations
With a name like that he would have to love the heat
It depends
Those who go to university in a different city move right after high school
For others, it's normally from 20 to 30
24, still proudly living with my mom
It's common to visit parents during breaks but that's not considered going "home" by most students
It's like visiting friends or relatives
I guess that after university most students stay in the city of their uni (it's usually a bigger city than their hometown, so it's easier for them to find a job)
It's still common to visit parents, though
During early 1930-ies ethnic insurgency in Central Asia was supported by UK and locals beyond USSR/Chinese border
To end this Soviet secret service OGPU (predessesor of NKVD/KGB) orginasied so-called "Altay Volunteer Army", which actually was thousands of OGPU troops with armored cars and bombers supported by an unlikely ally - White Russian emigrants
They entered China and supported pro-Soviet warlord against anti-Soviet warlord, Ma Zhongying
Battles were rather fierce as White and Red russians and their local allies pressed on, in some cases OGPU troops were supported by bombers dropping chemical weapons
In the end, Ma Zhongying was forced to retreat
As his enemies closed in, he decided to flee and got on a plane that was supposed to extract him to Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Quomintang China
However plane was actually piloted by Soviet agents who flew Ma Zhongying to USSR, where he vanished in OGPU  prisons
I love that history bit for crazy crossovers, politicing around local tribes, overall Wild West of Warlord-era China, fucking chemical bombs etc
There should be a film about this war

> However plane was actually piloted by Soviet agents who flew Ma Zhongying to USSR, where he vanished in OGPU  prisons
Now that's what I call a plot twist
Unity day
We have independence day on June 12
But it's kinda silly, so nobody celebrates it that much
What about salo
My Ukrainian ex from Kiev sweared youths don’t eat it anymore
> bears
Actually, I visited my extended family this summer in Zabaikaliye and bears were a real problem
One of them used to visit a summer camp just outside my village
And my grandparents neighbor was attacked while he was in taiga
I don’t know, 100% of Finns in Russian movies and ads are either drinking vodka, or are in sauna or both
Bears are just the big hamsters here
Who the hell rides hamsters
He is, but not in the way you're hoping
It's not epic and way sad
It's easy to judge from the outside but most people just want to live their lives peacefully, in all countries
They don't want to die for idea or turn into professional regime fighters
Peaceful methods to change something don't work because government is corrupt and has money and powers to repress and rig
We tried them, we try them still and a process is not going to stop but outcome is unclear
Violent methods can turn into a civil war and rob another generation or two or three of their normal life, and 90s were only 20 years ago, not even one generation had a chance to live their lives normally since previous cataclysm
It's not an easy choice and these people are not scared of nothing, the threat is more than real
It's not the Soviet mentality, it's a mentality of survivors
I personally am kinda annoyed by it too sometimes, but I can't judge
They are like that not because they are bad people or stupid people or subservient people, it's much more complex
edit: few typos
What's considered interracial
Slavic x Central Asian
Which Central Asian
Is a Slavic x Tatar couple interracial
How much Slavic is still Slavic
How much Tatar is still Tatar

Yeah, Tomsk was saved by being bypassed by the Trans-Siberian
Bashkirs, unlike Tatars, are kinda Asian in appearance, but all your points are valid
Well, not gonna lie, I don't know much about situation in Hungary and can't really compare it with Russian one

Just because
They are arrested, too
Oh, you don't agree, you want to rally
Have some broken leg or head, you filthy paid foreigner
There are rallies right now, every Saturday people are beaten and arrested for just peacefully walking on the streets with posters
They are brave and they try, process is moving somewhere, but results are unclear
And govt tries to suppress it as hard as they can
To overthrow Putin by force
He has army and police on his side, he has Rosgvardia which is special military unit for dealing with civilians and is loyal to Putin only, oprichniki basically
Russia doesn't have free access to guns, population is gunless, even our police is gunless usually
Commoners against trained and armed army don't have chances
Are you ready to throw your parent or spouse or child under the tanks for the sake of democracy
Majority is not ready, yeah
They hope that it'll sort itself out somehow, without blood and blowing the country to pieces again, they just have to bear with it a bit longer

I also hate it as a breakfast meal
For some reason my love towards buckwheat was reignited after spending 4 months in South East Asia
I loved the food there and I’m an adventurous eater, yet with the passing of time I’ve started to crave familiar things: rye bread, buckwheat, borscht, heavy cream
That's because going barefoot to a carpeted bathroom is a disgusting experience
That Napoleon and Hitler invaded us in winter
Everyone loved Stalin
Whites weren't democratic and didn't recognize Polish independence
Iirc they even refuse Pilsudski's offer of 200000 strong army in exchange for independence recognition
How did you count that
Many people in the West think that the Soviet Union is as evil as Nazi Germany and they don't even think that the SU saved Europe by sacrificing millions of people
Why is it misconception
For vatniks(Russian boomers) and older generations, younger people tend to dislike him more
Being colonial empire
Speaking of damage done to Europe, did Stalin poison Europeans
Did he conduct cruel, crazy experiments on people
Did he start the war
Did he destroy two entire cities (it's more about the kind-generous-cute-nice-good US)
I don't decline that the SU was not the best thing for Europe, but comparing to Nazi Germany is irrelevant
Imagine thinking that USSR wanted to exterminate all Ukrainians
\> Also USSR and Germany were allied at the moment
What
Even if Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is called an alliance, it was signed many months after events we are talking about
And USSR offered help back then, it's a well accepted fact
But neither Poland (which was pressuring Czechoslovakia) nor Romania (out of general fear of Soviet troops) allowed transport of Red army into Czechoslovakia
\> Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was a final piece of years-long cooperation
It isn't bias, it is BIASUS MAXIMUS
While USSR didn't break all ties with Germany upon Hitler seizing power and continued programs like joint tank development, it was anti-Nazi in most of its efforts, both diplomatic and military (clearest case bing Spanish Civil War)
Again, Western historians do not doubt it at it is crystal clear that both commoners and diplomats of the time knew USSR was anti-Nazi power
That's why Molotov-Ribbentrop caused such shock
Because it was 180 degrees turn
\> Do you even know what was Molotov-Ribbentrop about
It was about creating spheres of influence, similar to the Portugal-Spain Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494
Yes, and i never challenged that
All i said is that prior to M-R USSR was hostile to Nazi Germany, and that denying that is just weird because just about any document of that era about this topic confirms it
Pretty common in Russian villages and small towns
Why so angry Olaf
When I was at school, there was hardly anything positive said about the Imperial era *per se* (and the same for the USSR), though figures like Peter, Catherine and Alexander II were singled out as having been effective as rulers
Not good, I should stress
Just effective
It might have changed in recent years though
As for whether it was good or bad
I don't know
probably on balance, bad as it did a lot of awful things like persecuting Jews; the ethnic cleansing of the Circassians and other groups; co-operating with Prussia and Austria in wiping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth off the map etc
But it wasn't totally evil: It tried to free the Slavic peoples of the Ottoman Empire; gave Finland the status of an autonomous province (something which to this day makes Alexander II rather popular there) etc
Why neutral for the ERE
Just the sheer number of times it brought itself back and recovered from disaster qualifies it as a great empire

And Следствие вели with Lenid Kanevskiy
And Igor Prokopenko for insane conspiracy theories
Not by the general populace cause they all love him, but the ones that can think
do I even need to say who
In traditional sense: General Vlasov
In being a synonym for traitor: Pavel Morozov
In results of betrayal: Boris Yeltsin
Synonym of the traitor is [Vlasov] Also sometimes [Mazepa]
Not European but Peter the "Great", Lenin, and Stalin all come to mind easy
And then you have more conventional traitors like Andrei Vlasov (defected WW2 general that led the Russian Nazi army)
Nikolai II, All Russian presidents as well
I live on Kuusinen street in Moscow lol
What about Peter III that gave away Berlin and whole Prussia in 30 years war
More like incompetent idealist/useful tool
Either way, even if yes, not on a scale of Yeltsin
He basically destroyed local culture and arts and tried to clone Russia like it was second Holland (the flag of Russia is literally based on Holland) but ended up failing bad
He and his 18th century successors basically set Russia back 200 or 300 years
Russia only grew geopolitically under him (and an oppressive backward state is nothing to be proud of when it grows)
Why do you think you are better than Belarus
And don't you think that being sold to NATO isn't much better
For me it's absolutely the same cause there's an option of not being sold at all
Yup
So do you really believe anyone in NATO will care about other in case of war
Especially the USA
They don't give a damn about European countries, Trump even doesn't know where's Romania
Do you mean 6th largest economy in the world is barely holding
Tell that to the EU, shoutout to Greece, Baltic and more
Ukraine was quite ok until they fell for NATO and EU promises and had a revolution
It's their choice to be the bargaining chip in western hands
Or were it Russians who were shooting people in the center of Kiev
When we were friends they got Crimea rental, weapons, special prices for gas etc
Nowadays they hate us and blame for everything bad in the world but still want special prices for gas
That's what I call self-esteem
BTW only whores and slaves are sold
I consider being a slave to anybody is bad
For me it's almost two similar things, but of course being a western slave is more profitable
But the price might be bigger too
Well tbh it's not quite like that
I mean yes we have a dictator but i wouldn't say that it affects me much
I mean I don't give a shit and just doing the most to live the best life
And most people live the same life
They don't care about Siriya and Ukraine, Putin and corruption
They just want to be not disturbed
BTW Here we often say that in developed countries people achieve smth with the help of the state, while in Russia we achieve anything despite state's "help".
In 2017 film about corruption of our prime minister Dmitry Medvedev came out
He has stolen more then a billion dollars from our country
That started a wave of protests in Russia and people now generally more interested in politics than ever
The latest one was this summer in Moscow
People were protesting for honest municipal elections, which results are almost always were fabricated
A lot of protesters were  arrested for political views
One guy was sentenced in jail for 4 years for throwing a plastic bottle . Political repressions in Russia are extremely obvious
Our government really pissed of with corruption being investigated by non-commercial organizations and press
After that film a lot of other really important officials were proven to be corrupt, so now we understand that our government exists only to steal money from people

I think F-14 is prettier than Su-27

I think objectively speaking, Su-30 in VMF dark naval grey paintscheme is absolutely stunning
But I've always been a huge sucker for American naval aviation
Which is also shameful, considering my grand dad and step dad were with the Soviet navy
Russian Navy Su-30 don't have canards
I think they still look great
Paint is just out of this world
RuNavy air arm has patrol crafts, Tu-22M3s, Su-30s, MiG-31s and many other types of aircrafts
They are obviously land based, but they provide support for naval operations
What's good for the Russian kills the German
Незваный гость хуже татарина - Univited guest is worse than a Tatar
Sometimes we say something like "I'm freezing like a german in '41".
I'd say physical punishment to children
Whereas in Germany you can get away with murder of a spouse and indeed be praised on account of being brown, in Russia a man abusing a spouse will be killed by his neighbours in true justice
Likewise
Russia:
Documentary about the state of democracy in Russia
Very insightful
There are dolls made from nylon stockings called popiks
They are ugly as fuck and usually have some vulgar traits like big tits or nude/panties-clad bottoms (hence the name, "popa" is "bottom" or "backside", so it's literally dolls with bottoms) but otherwise look like amateurishly made kids' toys
Some people make them and some people even buy them, they became popular in 80s-90s probably [ Their whole existence is a complete mystery for me
Just why
Peter the Great
Like, he is called great for a reason, he changed a course of Russian history drastically, many contemporary things have their roots in Peter's activities
But at the same time he was quite cruel and ruthless, he needlessly destoyed many (cultural, historical) things in his quest of modernising Russia and he didn't give a fuck about how many people will suffer and die because of his whims
And he was an amateur in everything and many of his expensive projects failed
It's still questionable if he did more good or bad
Someone else already said Peter I, so I'm going to go for Tsarina Elizabeth
She didn't do anything egregious like getting thousands of people killed building Petersburg like Peter did; but she personally was a bad person despite her thinking of herself as a kind empress
• She had her nephew, Ivan VI (who had been crowned so he wasn't just a pretender) locked away in a fortress on his own for his entire life since he was a small child, until he was killed in an attempt to free him
• She was so vain she reduced the future Catherine the Great to tears and depression for the sin of looking good at a ball (i.e. better than she looked) - by telling her she was spoiled, withdrawing her allowance and according to some accounts hacking Catherine's hair to a mess with a pair of scissors
• Blamed Catherine for the fact she had no children with her chosen successor Peter, and made her a prisoner in her rooms watched by a abusive married couple who bullied her despite the fact it was Peter who ensured the marriage remained childless
• Started a war with Frederick the Great of Prussia because he made jokes about her being the 'Messalina of the North' (the Roman Empress Messalina was widely considered a debauched whore, sleeping with anything that moved) and that her reign was the "rule of c*nt" (as in, lady parts)
And much more
We have classic "Taras Bulba" by Gogol where cossack Taras kills his son Andriy as a traitor and shame of family because he falls in love with some Polish girl and refuses to fight Poles, wants to stay with her
But Poles are evil and mortal enemies, blood of people calls to be avenged and war is a must, so Taras says "I spawned you - and I will end you too" and does just that
Taras kinda national (fictional) hero too, he sacrifices personal for the sake of his country
A+ parenting too, lol
This, basically
Petersburg alone is built on the bones of at least 30
000 (though some estimates put it at over 100
000) people who died of malaria, lack of food etc
It was literally a swamp when we conquered it from the Swedes
> he didn't give a fuck about how many people will suffer and die because of his whims
This is literally all of the Tsars lol
I don't really think it's fair to describe him as an amateur at everything though (by that logic, so was Catherine - her attempt at changing the law failed, her handling of her husband was quite blatantly an assassination etc)
His education wasn't exactly thorough, and as for cultural things, I'm quite thankful Russia doesn't still have crap like the terem
To be fair though, Andriy betrays his army and steals food from his father and their people before running to his girl's side in the middle of the war
Then Taras's second son is captured and tortured and executed before his eyes by Poles, that son stays loyal to his people to the end
Then Taras turns into a death machine and roams in Poland with the rest of his army killing everything and everyone, and then he caught by Poles and burned alive while saving his army
Fun times
But that catch phrase is what most people remember from all the book usually
It's very possible
We learn something new everyday))
Three mistakes that lead to the civil war and reign of Bolsheviks:
Trying to make monarchy work after the revolution if 1905
Not quitting WW1 after the February revolution
October revolution,
It's always Moscow
Russia is a very unequal and centralized country, and Moscow is like a completely different world
Actually its Sochi
In my opinion, Sochi is way too trashy to even be in top 10
>Do people ever actually visit eastern Russia
Like is it normal to go on vacation over there
As a tourist destination, not much
There's some really great nature there, like Lake Baikal or Kamchatka for example, but they lack tourist infrastructure, and traveling there is way too expensive for most Russians (traveling to other European countries is usually cheaper)
Russia is big, the Moscow-Vladivostok flight is almost the same distance as Moscow-New York
And cities there tend to be pretty boring
>Also it’s a bit surprising there’s not much major development on the eastern coast now that I think about it
The entire Far East with the area equal to 70% of USA is just 8 million people, there is not a single million city there
We simply don't have the population density to get major development
Only the European part of Russia is somewhat decently populated
The question was about what city is growing at a
crazy rate
Have you seen how many development projects lately in Sochi
Which has precisely zero to do with the question
Most of Siberia and Far East are indeed not worth inhabiting
Russia is trying to develop the East coast, but Russia's presence there won't become much larger anytime soon, as there's little incentive for people to permanently move there, and the population of Russia isn't growing either

I just feel so envious that in all other European countries (except of several other unlucky ones) they do have it
You guys have pretty functional government
You can pay taxes and vote online, and that’s pretty unique

They wouldn't be here at all if that was true
We usually mark blank pages with a huge Z with the line
Other than that, we use it only in math and it's without
But when it comes to foreign languages, it tends to vary
I write just a simple z, but my German teacher used to write the fancy cursive z with a loop
We have first name, last name, and "patronymic" (???), showing your father's name
You got the word right
Have no fear
I just didnt expect it to be spelt like that
Bet it sounds weird to Dutch people when other Russians address you using your Christian name and patronymic at the same time
We dont
I'm still a bit weirded out by the fact that you can only buy booze from government stores in some Nordic countries
Addressing someone by their last name is a bit rude
That's what teachers and officers do, or what bosses do when they are angry
Strangers call you "young man". When you're introduced, younger Russians give you just their first name
You use them to introduce yourself, you use them to ask about other people, but you don't use them to address other people, unless they are foreigners or underlings
For example, Putin would say, "Rad vas videtj, gospodin Makron" , which the interpreter would repeat as "Je suis content de vous voir, Monsieur Macron", or whatever the proper French for "glad to see you" is
He would also say, "Job tvoju matj, Surkov, kakogo huja
", because Vladislav Jurjević Surkov promised him everything would go just as planned, but Ukraine backed out of the deal they had agreed upon beforehand
We still have people who put [this] ("we could do that again") on their cars
Often times cars made in Germany, or in Russia by Germans

I would like friendlier relations with our neighbors to make it easier for traveling
Very hard to do so with our western neighbors unfortunately
They have already appropriated Anastasia, please no more princesses from Russia
What about Wilhelmina, a single mother and a crack shot who doesn't want to marry an old Austrian king and become a princess
Well Disney owns Fox now, so she's become a Disney princess
I remember a lesson on it somewhere in school
Maybe also in the country that was the main part of the other side of that war
Out of interest, how is WW2 handled in Hungary
Does it focus on the war in the east
Hungarian internal politics with Horthy
The Holocaust
In fairness, Finland had advantages that you didn't.
I went to school in his early years before he started fucking with the curriculum too much
>And how is it in Russia
I remember someone told be that you call the Great Patriotic War
Not everyone does, but it's a name which gets used enough to be common
When I went to school it was fairly balanced
Nothing was really hidden
The Pact with the Nazis; the Winter War; Germany during the invasion etc
Nowadays, it's faithful enough to the truth it's adequate but it's clever with how it tells the tale
For example, when it comes to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the textbooks will happily admit we made a non-aggression pact but sneakily leave out the secret protocols (splitting Poland and other things) in it
I have no problem remembering the WWII generation, but it makes me a bit uncomfortable sometimes how far it gets taken
Stuff like the '[Immortal Regiment] where people march with photos of their dead relatives is really common now
Regarding the rest of the world, it got a couple of lessons and that was it when I was at school
I don't know how it is right now; but I'd assume it's the same or even less
Not likely
France and the UK only said that so they had an excuse to have troops in Sweden and Norway (to deprive Germany of the raw materials you sold them, and ports to get into the Atlantic)
Unfortunately, Germany beat them to Norway
Leadership was undoubtedly part of it
But if we're looking at it in terms of body count, then the biggest enemy we faced was the weather
More died due to exposure than fighting (helped by consistent Finnish destroying of field kitchens and other stuff like that)
Though I suppose that's again due to poor leadership on our part
None of our neighbors were friendly, but yes
Maybe, maybe not
I don't think it had that big an effect as once the commander in charge was changed and the troops were given proper time to plan and practice, the Finnish defenses didn't last all that long
That works better

Winter Palace or St

The Kremlin and the red square
Great examples
Think our churches are the mot beautiful in the world
Because it's the Muscovite style :P I always kinda thought our architecture was a reflection of the country
Take St Basil's Cathedral for example; it gives the impression of being on the far away horizon if you know what I mean
Compared to say [Aachen Cathedral] which gives the impression of being 'enclosed
They definitely are
I mean, Charlemagne's buried there
:) Hmm, maybe [St Stephen's Cathedral] then

This only works for naturalised citizens, though
You can have multiple citizenships from births as well
For me English is the best language
I find in it some subtlety
So popular and logical language
I know 3 languages and even my native language isn’t so beautiful
Don't like when people joke about Serbia, Bulgaria, or Belarus
Especially Serbia I think gets an undeserved bad reputation
Tbf what Spain did from 1492 up until 1520s or so seems disgusting even for the time
Columbus wasn't sent back to Spain in chains for nothing
After that it seems like it was more moderate
I don't know how good the Russian course is, but I found French from English quite useful for getting the basics down
I crammed it intensively for the first couple of weeks, and that enabled me to overcome the initial barrier and start to understand some very basic input aimed at learners
Then I moved on to other means of learning the language
It's also good for internalising the grammar basics (like plurals, conjugations, etc
) and as a source of most basic input when you're just starting out
I agree with most of what you said, especially that Duolingo is helpful for introducing yourself to a language
I often hear that "Duolingo won't make you fluent", but why should it
Who said you should be using the same resources and doing the same things at all levels
Every method out there exists with a particular purpose in mind, and Duolingo's purpose is to familiarise you with the basics, not "make you fluent".
As to the Portuguese course being as good as any other, I've actually read that not all of them are created equal
Some are considered very extensive and well-structured like (reportedly) Norwegian, and some were created by people who had no idea about the language and filled the course with ungrammatical or nonsensical translations
And then there's everything in-between
Isn't that because it uses (a lot of) Mexican Spanish though
Yeah, it's the same complaint learners of Russian often post on Reddit
You can usually rearrange the subject, verb and object(s) however you feel like, but apparently Duolingo won't accept anything other than SVO
Well, the French course I was doing had notes attached to each lesson
They explained all the concepts and rules necessary to complete them
Sure, I also looked into other resources to learn about grammar in a more structured way, but I'm talking more about drilling/practicing rather than acquiring a theoretical knowledge of certain concepts
I guess you're right, though it should probably be obvious that you can't become fluent just by drilling tests
It definitely has its advantages when its scope and limitations are taken into account
Oh okay then, I didn't like Duo for Spanish but now I'm certain I'll be using something else, AssiMil or something
Yeah, I've heard of a course on some rare language that was apparently created by someone who didn't speak English, and none of the English translations made any sense
Don't remember what it was, though
Good luck with your Russian btw
uncle Vasya from the next entrance, legends say that he can drink 10 liters of vodka in one gulp
But jokes aside I don't think that we have any local folklore monsters, maybe some legends about some psychos but not monsters
EDIT: I was meant to say that we don't have any modern folklore monsters like bigfoot or chupacabra
Zmei Gorynich - a russian folklore dragon or serpent, or sometimes a human-like character with dragon-like traits
Usually multi-headed and can be killed only by cutting off his heads
I don't mean we don't have old folklore creatures, I mean we don't have any monsters like bigfoot and other urban legends that we can specify the location of

Mildly autistic, probably
I have never heard before that Finns are slow and dumb
I think this is an american thing
I don't know about rest of Europe, but in Russia we never had such kind of joke
Remember that video about the policeman inviting rubberneckers to stop and take a closer look at dead bodies
His German-accented English was so gentle, while the only time we heard him speak German he was shouting at the traffic like an angry feldwebel

The difference is we can get back any island or peninsula, and Denmark cannot

Prince St
Alexander Nevsky who defended Russia against catholic northern crusaders (swedes and baltic germans)
Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin: raised Russian people to expel foreign occupants during the Times of Trouble
For Russia, we have a fair few
* Saint Alexander Nevsky (literally meaning "*of the Neva*") stopped the conquest eastwards of the Swedes (at the aforementioned Neva river), and the German Teutonic Knights near Pskov (it was one-sided enough to be called a 'massacre on the ice')
Unfortunately, he was a willing helper in the Mongol subjugation of the principalities
* Kozma Minin and Dmitri Pozharskiy (I'm putting them in the same bullet point because they're intertwined) were respectively, a meat trader from Nizhny Novgorod and a minor nobleman from Moscow
They're famous because they formed an integral part of the army (Minin recruited the men and Pozharsky led it) which cleared the Polish from the Kremlin so that Mikhail Romanov (who's important to the next one on the list) could be crowned Tsar
* Ivan Susanin wasn't a nobleman
He was a simple peasant, but, when the Poles invaded in order to try and foist their choice for Tsar on us during the "Time of Troubles" (after Ivan Grozny died); he was asked to lead the Poles to where Mikhail Romanov (later the first Romanov Tsar) was hiding with his mother
He agreed
and then promptly lead the Poles deep into the woods where they became lost, while his son in law ran to Mikhail and told him to flee
* Alexander Suvorov, is probably the finest soldier Russia has ever produced
In his entire career, he didn't lose a single battle (over 50 fought) and he's mostly responsible for why Yekaterina Velikaya (Catherine the Great) has lots of conquests to her name
He didn't just fight the Turks and Polish rebels, he successfully erased nearly all of Napoleon's conquests in Italy and fought off a French force four times the size of his in Switzerland while withdrawing
* Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) was the Tsar who turned us from the strange, eastern kingdom of Muscovy into the Russian Empire, one of the Great Powers of Europe
There's a story about how when he was a child and out with a non-Russian friend of his, he found an abandoned Dutch ship sitting in a warehouse if I remember correctly
He was fascinated by it and asked for it to be restored
He was unusual in that he was excited by the west and wanted to import as much as he could to make his patrimony like the western kingdoms
And he did
Probably the biggest indicator of his legacy is the city I live in: Saint Petersburg, which he won from Charles XII (who even today is revered as Sweden's second greatest warrior king after Gustavus Adolphus)
France - Arnaud Beltrame
Cops who died two years ago after exchanging place with hostage of terrorist
Yes
Beltrame is the first that came to my mind
I would add also Ivan Susanin [ , he is often mentioned in jokes but still a hero
tl;dr he led squad of Poles into a deep forest pretending to help and was killed by them in Time of Troubles
We kinda had almost repeat in WWII [ A grandpa led Nazi troops into an ambush and became an oldest hero of USSR post mortem
But he is not widely known
That war just wasn't about victory, it was about our very survival, our existance as people, not even as nation
Nazis did such things to our population on occupied territories that people were willing to self-sacrifice to the end but get them out because the alternative was to be killed anyway
Hitler clearly stated that population of USSR are not humans to him and there shouldn't be any pity
So troops acted accordingly [ We just couldn't surrender and wait for rescue
So from WWII we have so many heroes that a full list would take a kilometer
There were collaborants too though, Nazis tortured and starved Soviet prisoners of war to force them to collaborate, so some died refusing and some agreed
Two or my great grandfathers fought in WWII, one grandfather was a logistics officer managing some part of the Chernobyl containment and cleanup effort
My grandpa was involved in Soviet politics in Latin America quite heavily
My great granfather died in WW2
My great grandparents took part in WW2
Great grandma was a nurse, her future husband was an artillery officer
During the war he was demoted to penalty battalion for leaving their cannons under enemy surrounding (not executed because he saved his subordinates by doing that)
Later he was restored in his rank when he lead the charge into enemy trenches and secured an important position during forcing the river Dnepr in Ukraine
He took part in storming Berlin by the end of the war and had a successful military career back home until retirement
His parade uniform easily weighted around 5 kg from all the regalia, he wore it with pride every Victory Day (May 9th)
Another great grandpa served in a tank crew, but I don't know much about his story, met him only once when I was little
Go back more than a few generations and everyone's related to everyone
So I assume I'm related to every significant figure in English history prior to the year 1500 or so
Once, after the fall Byzantine, I think
Interesting=) Does this mean that if Finland would join the USSR and the Bolsheviks lost the Yakut revolt then Yakutia became the last heir of the Roman Empire
Wow, that's really crazy=)
Russian words on the left and their real meanings on the right:
* smoking > tuxedo
* autostop > hitch-hiking
* killer > hitman
*  [face control] > a policy of a nightclub to let or not let you in based on the way you look
Happy end
Yeah, we have those coaches as well
especially in brainwashing business environments
Same for everything in your list except *footing*, although we normally use meeting to mean a public protest
Videoclip - music video
Haha, I will start using *randomovy* in Russian now
It will spice things up a little bit because we normally say *randomny*.
We have fichas too
Yeah, thanks for pointing out
Russian sources list it as a pseudo-anglicism without providing the origin of the word, so that's why I thought it should be there
Killer in English just means someone/something that kills, but in Russian it means someone who is paid to kill people
Do you use it in Polish this way
Smoking in English means doing a ciggie, but not part of your suit
The other two words don't exist in English
I was surprised to know too
We always use a Russian word for jogging, but I've just googled *footing* (adopted for Russian) and found an example when it means jogging
Yeah, btw I had to google that a couple of months ago because I wasn't sure it would still be clip in English
Yeah, but we don't mean [this]
We also say *na randome* with the prepositional case of *random* (we have the prepositional instead of locative)
It literally means "on random", although the English idiom is "at random".
We can't, but it doesn't stop people going there
The government makes up shit to criminalise particular protests
That's gonna be a great language exchange
let's see how we bring them closer together after they have been diverging for over a 1000 years
The standard word in Russian is *sluchajny*, but like you said, it doesn't have that special vibe
*sluchajny* for random has an English sound as in *church*. Actually, the standard word for "listen
" would be *slushaj* (*sh* as in English *ship*)
But you can also say *sluhaj* and be understood
That's considered dialectal/colloquial, and my grandmother sometimes uses it
Yeah, I'm also impressed by Polish and other Slavic languages too
I want to learn one at some point in the future and I'm thinking about Polish or Serbian (= Croatian = Bosnian = ~~Macedonian~~ Montenegrin)  because these two are the biggest
But I will probably start with Polish because the grammar is more similar to Russian (shit, they're almost identical
) and it's easier to understand spoken Polish than spoken Serbian for some reason
We call it the same thing pronounced with a Russian accent, but I had to google it because I'm bad at history and I don't know this term
If you mean unification in general, it would be *objedinenie*.
Never use "usual" street taxi especially at airports, rail terminals and so on
Their prices are unbelievably high when they saw a foreign tourist
Always use online apps for taxi (Uber, Gett, Yandex Taxi) instead of
Their prices are fixed, predictable and low
The lost wallet scam
You see someone drop a wallet, pick it up, chase after them, hand it back, the person starts to thank you, then "notices it misses a few high value notes". A few "convenient" witnesses claim they saw you take them out
DON'T TRUST GOPNIKS
They are tricksters that want to steal your money for Vodka
Every month or so I see a Gopnik approach a tourist asking them to 'see their phone' so they can make a 'call' but really they just run off, or if they're brave enough straight up mug you
They aren't funny "cheeki breeki cyka blyat xD" they are gangsters and thugs
[Our train companies are just a racket]
Seriously, though, it's cheaper to fly to Scotland than to take a train
Never heard of it actually
Sounds funny because in my hometown (and in many other Russian cities)
most buses are used buses brought from Germany
PS I know you said about personal cars but anyway
Except countries with lack of taxi online apps
Turkey for example
They also have food delivery and carsharing
Now it's often a card forgotten in an ATM
Actually, Yandex bought Uber's Russian division, so there's no more independent Uber in Russia, Uber app will get you Yandex taxi
I think there's a bigger factor causing many Russians to travel to Belarus: for a lot of Russians, Belarus is one of few countries they are allowed to visit due to having security clearance
We played knuckles, palm slap and break the chain as well, but the stupidest game was "the last one to run across the street in front of a car wins".
Usually I ask if they wanna hear a piece of a poem in Russian
Almost every time the answer is yes
So I tell them that short verse from Tvardovsky' poem "Vasili Tyorkin" which I remember from school
Переправа, переправа!
Берег левый, берег правый,
Снег шершавый, кромка льда...
Кому память, кому слава,
Кому темная вода,
Ни приметы, ни следа.
That's an amazing poem, very melodic
Tvardovsky puts the language of plain folks into beautiful hymn dedicated to those russian soldiers who went through the horror of WW2
No politics though
It's just one of the most beautiful representations of my language
Sounds like Kazakhstan is finlandized by two countries at once
That justice will be as swift as that for people like [ .
> value honor, respect and personal liberties above brute force, influence and wealth
Every country in the world claims to do it, but in reality none of them do
We've switched to democracy once
Not so long ago, we even gave independence to many smaller countries one of which was Lithuania, giving up 1/3 of the land we had
This switch turned us into ruins
Complete chaos
We were betrayed by those who promisedus better life and safety
No way our people will try to change to democracy again
Samara is the largest Russian city that isn't famous for anything
Smaller Toljatti/Togliatti nearby is the home of Lada and is more famous
I would say that all cities except Moscow and St
Petersburg are unknown outside post-USSR countries
Russia has 15 cities over 1M people, although there are only 33 cities in Europe with more than a million people, of which 8 are from Russia
There's also Lienz, which is completely obscured by Linz
Yeah, we don't call them Samara here
It's number eight, number nine, number ninety-nine or just the chisel

"Belka". It's easy to pronounce if you can pronounce the soft (palatalised) B.
Dunno, foreign policy is the smallest of the sins of our government, really
I mean there many not optimal choices, but comparing to the internal policies they implement, diplomacy isn't that big of a deal
Crimean annexation is kinda sensible from Russian pov
Unfortunately it facilitated Putin to establish full on dictatorship, but from geopolitical point of view it had sense for Russia to annex the peninsula
Although I would rather give the locals a legit referendum
But the end result would hardly be different
As for Georgia, Saakashvily was a cocky fool and fell into a trap
But it was he who decided to use force to reincorporate breakaway republics, not Russia
I'm more opposed to the war in Donbass and playing nice with Chinese in Central Asia
Syrian affair is also kinda dubious, but it is too early to say for sure
Time will show
It is rather irrelevant whether Estonia has low or high support for NATO in a grand scheme of things
As to cooperation, the government tries to cooperate with Germany and China, two most important neighbors
I would rather have good relations with Ukraine as well, but this ship has already sailed, unfortunately
Good relations with other neighboring countries are optional for the well being of Russia
According to your logic every country should stop influencing other counties
Although it is a nice idealistic position, real world doesn’t work like this
Either you shape your geopolitical environment or it shapes you
I think conflict in Ukraine is more of a road block in Russia-German rapprochement
As well as the fact that current Russian economy is in so bad shape that we cannot really offer that much as partners
Therefore there is no political will in both Paris and Berlin to change current status quo
But it’s rather naive to think that political elites in Poland and the Baltics would be able to indefinitely resist political pressure from major EU members, if one day they decided to change their Russian policy
Especially if UK really leaves the EU
But it’s all very theoretical
I’m pretty sure that Russia beneficial as an ally to Germany would also be beneficial to the Eastern Europeans as a neighbor
I love you too, darling
My love is enough for us two both
Have a good evening
There is so much more to being a decent man than having or not having certain political affiliations, ma dude
Where did I say that I support offensive wars
Yeah, it's very common
For most students it's just wasted money imo
They often do so because 1) they are lazy to practice on their own, even though there are innumerable preparation materials all over the internet; 2) they think hiring s tutor is like a magic button that will bring you the highest results even if you aren't doing anything; 3) they think tutors are better than school teachers just because they are tutors, which isn't always so; 4) it's their helicoptering parents who hire 10 tutors to keep their child busy 24/7; etc
But it's good money for tutors
The average price is around 15€ per hour depending on the subject
Some of my uni group mates started tutoring maths, physics and IT and charged ≈23€ despite zero experience in tutoring
Why
Because parents are ready to pay
In my country the difference in difficulty between the material that the school curriculum offers and the final exam is tremendously high
Most high graders visit private tutors (in russian they're called "репетитор")
Doing that during other years of school except the final one is much less common, though it is possible that you meet several people who do this if you attend a random class in an average school
Usually that's done, so that children won't fall back in their studies and will for sure catch up with the information that the school course provides
Were else we should to store them

Naturally, it feels like it should be neuter, as words ending by 'e' are always neuter
However, for some historical reasons, it's 'officially correct' to regard it as if it was masculine
And since any adjectives (and sometimes verbs) should be inflected corresponding to a subject's gender in Russian, you can quite often hear people correcting 'incorrect' endings pronounced by other people
Suprisingly it is whether we should call shawarma “shaverma” or “shaurma”
I would add a swear word "blyad" and a holywar about "blyat" being separate word or just incorrect spelling
"Blyad" originally means "whore" but is often used as something like "oh fuck
", so some people argue that "blyad" is a noun and "blyat" is an interjection
It gets annoying actually when grammar nazis of both kinds turn random thread into an epic battle over a swear word
Brandon Flowers should be granted peerage
I'll prefer a plane over 4+ hours on a day train or 12+ hours on an overnight train
Short flights with all the time needed before and after the flight require about 3-4 hours, so it's just a matter of time spent travelling
Though in practice there's rarely a choice, often something (might be train, might be plane) is much cheaper, or only one of them is available
There always that "Cold blue" filter
Russian speaking very strange too
Vodka, ushanka, balalayka, etc
More of video games
But I feel like every call of Duty portrays us as evil war crime committing warlords
And we are, but what country isn't? Like the Us has committed multiple atrocities, but we're always the bad guys ;-;
As for movies, pretty much the same
As either evil/corrupt (especially during Soviet era timelines) and or poor 3rd world gopnik trash
Which I admit is kinda true
As well as the whole subculture of Slavaboos on the internet that think 'Russia greatest country, putin good, Russia is so cool
Cyka blyat XDD'
I've visited the west a couple of times and I get either
Mistrust, or some dumbass saying 'tee hee cyka blyat hahahah'. Fortunately not everyone is an asshole so this does not not happen every time
Oh, easier to remember what do western movie portray correct=) In all Hollywood movies, Russia is frozen Morder, lands of pure evil, where nobody behaves like real people
People are either unreasonably aggressive, or cowardly and clogged
Sometimes both
I think Russia is the most caricatured country in movies
The sky is always grey
It is always snowy
Everyone forgot how to use Name+Patronymic and only says tovarish
The setting of the movie Age of Ultron looks like it's set somewhere around Slovenia or Croatia
Wish that Slavaboos would appreciate things like the Bolshoy Teatr, Kreml', etc, as opposed to just sharing memes about Putin
Well, the sky is always grey
There was a huge scandal about it
Although “evil Ruskies doing evil stuff for the sake of doing evil stuff” trope is pretty common and people are usually apathetic about it and even like it sometimes new CoD rubbed in very wrong places
Namely that it portrays an ongoing conflict where real Russian servicemen are involved and the game portrays them as animals that commit war crimes for breakfast, lunch and dinner
On top of it, those war crimes they commit ARE ACTUAL AMERICAN war crimes that were committed by the US forces in Iraq
Plus there are many cultural tropes that are also go beyond what is acceptable by Russian standards
My favorite one being a dialog between two Russians that call protagonists barbarians because they are led by a female
You know, those backwater Russians, never heard about females on frontlines
Pretty indignant
And then a video of our PMC's dismembering a bound guy in Syria leaked
Nah man, just blame it on Austria lol
It is different parts of the same process
Propaganda as it is according to Goebbels
Portray the enemy as subhuman so that no one feels sympathy for him
America and Britain have succeeded in it
We are almost used to such an attitude toward us but it sometimes make us annoying
We have a special term for this klyukva
Sometimes it give us a lot of lulz
Now - never
Only places where modern Russians say “tovarisch” is military and police
Service members are required to say “Tovarisch [rank]” while talking to a superior
Like “Tovarisch captain, ask permission to take a dump”. But then again, no one will say “Hello, Tovarisch”. That was super weird even during commie times
Formal way of starting a conversation is by using Name+Patronymic, like “Oleg Ivanovich, can we talk
”. It was used in Imperial Russia, in USSR and is still used now
I find it really funny that the Russian community kinda embraced the trope and now meme-ing pretty hard on the CoD plot with videos about J-12 guy and stuff
Pretty horrible in the context of the game, but I guess empowering in the cultural scope
Bf3 had surprisingly good SP, looking back to it now
It had competent plot with not that critically many clichés, good levels, memorable moments
I replayed Super Hornet like maybe 10 times
DICE really droped the ball in later games
And all units retained red banners
It's more of a military tradition from the height of Russian military power rather than something associated with the commies
I was about 7-10 years old, but most children learn earlier
But yeah, I also learnt to ice-skate last winter at 20 when everyone else here is *born* with it
And I still can't rollerblade
Well, I failed when I was trying as a kid, but maybe I could now if I tried again
At least, that's how it worked with my ice-skating
I learned to ride as a kid
Since 4-5 years old
I didn’t ride in my teen years, but I start commute on my singlespeed (now fixed gear) bike 2 years ago (I’m 25 y.o.) and I love it
It is dangerous sometimes here in Russia, but I’m totally ok with it, because I’m russian
I think late 1800s in the Balkans would be the perfect setting for a video game
Please tell me what nicknames do you have for Russians
>Swołocz
This is a common insult, at least in Russian
Why does this apply specifically to the Russians
Now i understand, thanks
We were taught pretty a lot about WWII, I'd say almost the whole year there was nothing but this war on History classes
Also when I was younger veterans used to come and tell about it
There's pretty much difference between western and Russian approach to teaching WWII
First of all I'd say here we are believed to be if not the only one, but main makers of victory
The whole western front operation (D-day and everything) is viewed mostly as an act of treachery than help ('the allies didn't take any action until they realised that the USSR is capable to free whole Europe up to English Channel
Of course they didn't want to lose an opportunity to be victors and gain influence on western Europe and Germany'.)
Secondly, of course we are taught about Holocaust, but I wouldn't say that Jews suffered more than Russians or Poles
Almost everyone in my class had at least one relative who was moved to a death or a concentration camp
So I was taught that Russians (the USSR citizens in this case) suffered the most in this war
We were taught a lot things about WWII (from June 22, 1941 till May 9, 1945 - we call it The Great Patriotic War) - battles, generals' actions and great strategic moves, personal stories of notable persons, political situation, Stalin's actions etc
Also we were taught about Soviet operation in the Far East
BTW there was no operations except Pearl Harbor attack and Hirosima/Nagasaki bombing in which the Allies were involved
I tried to write down everything what I believed would be interesting for non-Russians
Anyway feel free to ask me anything
>Firstly, she was dead sure that in USA everybody believes, that their country by oneself won WWII and saved the whole world (have never seen any American who would think that way)
Well, that just means that you have never seen any American
Pitching in with a different perspective and more emphasis on why your particular teacher matters
Our class had a teacher with a penchant for her students crafting their own theories and explanations to challenge her views, so the consensus we arrived at was pretty much that USSR was biding for time and attempting to secure as much territory from potential Reich rule before the looming war
Interestingly enough, we also covered late 1920s industrial cooperation between USSR and Germany in circumvention of post-WWI international regulations pretty well
Pitching in again with a different teacher and different experience
It was pretty much "territorial acquisition to shift the border away from vulnerable SPb" and "a massive failure thanks to the gutted officer corps that had no idea what they were doing".
Late Imperial Russia
There is a meme “Россия которую мы потеряли”, Russian that we lost
Some nationalist and unsurprisingly current government, while talking about late Empire, concentrate on “culture”, developing economy and “patriotism”, while neglecting obvious flaws of the dying system
Cold War era USSR
Once again, many people prefer to concentrate on the amount of influence and power USSR had, as well as good standards of living of Brezhnev era, small amount of social problems (comparing to present day) and developing infrastructure while ignoring all the deficiencies of the system and repressions
Pretty much same here, but I also have heard some stories from my grandfather about how he ate wood grouses, black grouses, pheasants, etc (cause he lived in a village for a long time and was a game hunter)
I wouldn't say it's the same
In Russia, duck and goose, despite being part of the traditional cuisine, are extremely rarely eaten these days
But turkey is quite popular
Idk, we had duck as a 2021 New Year dish :P
You can even find them in supermarkets like Lenta
edit: but speaking in general, chicken and turkey are the most popular birds definetely
That's the point
In Ukraine, it's more or less an everyday dish, as far as I understand
Over here, duck can only be found in some supermarkets, and there's never a wide selection of cuts like with chicken or other meats
Goose is even more difficult to find
[Norilsk] I guess
To be fair you can't really call it an ugly city, because it has been built literally on the edge of the world in very severe weather conditions by lots of architects and urbanists from Saint Petersburg
So I'd call it beautiful in its own, unique way, that is not that easy to understand
Actually, they’re slowly rebuilding it
Actually, Norilsk does not have such a large permanent population
Most people working there in a shift
We call it Vakhta
They work month there and month they rest in their real home
Norilsk has a large factory and the largest nickel deposits that are there always a lot of work and money
[Yep, there have been some sparse projects happening in the region,] fingers crossed that the trend will continue
Certainly
The extensive restoration projects being done in the Netherlands, St
Pete’s, Hungary, and Poland are truly things worthy of admiration
Seeing something that the world had initially lost brought back to life is just so exhilarating, as it is true architectural justice
Nah
Muscovite accent is very weak, almost indistinguishable from standard Russian, and even though Siberians say we stretch our vowels, it's hard to mock Muscovites while surrounded by them in Moscow, even if you're a tough Siberian
Verbs *одеть* (odet', to dress [somebody]) and *надеть* (nadet', to put on [an item of clothing])
*-тся/-ться* (-tsya/-t'sya) at the end of reflexive verbs
The former one is the present third person form, the latter one is the infinitive
For example, *бояться* (boyat'sya) means *to be afraid*, *они боятся* (oni boyatsya) means *they are afraid*. The pronunciation is exactly the same, that's why many people make this mistake
ь in the endings of 3rd person verbs and absence of ь in the endings of infinitives
The wrong amount of н in the suffixes of different words (sometimes it should be one, sometimes two)
Mistakes with particles (there are rules when they are written with the word, separately or divided by hyphen)
Commas
Wrong spelling of the words with unstressed vowels
The rule is indeed easy, but it doesn't make it a less common mistake
The first mistake can also be avoided by using the simple mnemonic: "одеть Надежду, надеть одежду" (*translit*. odet' Nadezhdu, nadet' odezhdu; *trans
* To dress Nadezhda, to put on clothes)
Some people just don't want to think when they write
Well, you have to remember that the prefixes are the opposite
Also, it uses the fact that—unlike "одеть одежду" which is a common mistake—"надеть Надежду" sounds *really wrong* to a native Russian speaker
My impressions, in 1998, were "This place is not suited for normal human life"
But I have been to Manhattan only
When I was a little boy, about 10 years old, I had a  remote control car
I used to play with it at home only
But once I decided to show it to my friend and play with outside
One stranger boy had come to us and begun to ask questions
After some time he took my car and run away
It was only 2 times by parents had some items stolen (no violence involved)
How do you live after that
There's been many cases here when people invested in a property that is still in its planning stage, but then it turned out to be a scam
I don't think that happens now because there's more control over it lately
At least they gave you the pen
Here, if you give someone a pen, it is an unspoken rule that they never return it
If for a minute, they are supposed to return it
But if you give them a pen for a couple of lessons or the entire day, then forget about it
It's not rude to ask about it, but it most likely won't help because they will have lost it or will "return it the next day".
Россия (Русь) матушка - mother Russia
With tint of sentiment
Отечество - Fatherland
Sounds quite solemn
Not identic to Russia itself, so can be used by any nation towards their homeland
Родина - kin's land
Sounds neutral
Can be used by anyone, not only Russians
Отчизна - same as Fatherland but slightly old-fashioned and poetic
Родина-мать - motherland of our kin or something like that
Sounds pompous
Nowadays the second and third are the most common
Russia is the mother whereas the land itself is the land of our fathers and kin
Pretty simple
In Russian you've got *both* "rodina" (motherland) and "otetchestvo" (fatherland)
Which are both used in similar contexts
Pretty much the same thing with Russian родина (rodina)
It just means person's home country without any specific connection to Russia
You can hear news like "some tourists finally returned to their rodina after being trapped in another country for some reason".
Just like clling Russia "Motherland"
Native
That's what every new house gets by default these days
Not all of them are two-hinged, but usually they are as it's a cheap option
That's a very interesting fact
In Eugene Onegin we also have a mention of a window in German-owned bakery that is called vasisdas
Can anyone suggest me Youtube channel where I can see interviews of famous people
In English, of course
I’m into cycling and especially fixed gear and I love nature so I really enjoy recent videos of PRPLXBLZ
Vdud
This is the channel of Russian man who makes interviews with famous people
For example, politicians, musicians, actors
I can say that his interviews are masterpieces
He makes huge work and I appreciate it
Yuri Dud is a young journalist
Also, he released some documentary films on his channel
Some of them have English subtitles
And if you learn Russian, his channel will exactly help you
It's sad that they've stopped, but I can see why - they've exhausted the concept
Still rewatching Carnivorous Christmas Table every December religiously, probably their best episode
It's not old fashioned
It's daily greeting for men
Very common
We always shake hands as a greeting and when leaving
Every fucking break in school I shake hands with friends from another class and at morning with my
Very common
That even necessarily
I noticed that I don't always shake hands with closer friends or friends whom  I see often, which is reciprocal, even though we never discussed it
It would feel kinda weird, but I don't know why
Well, a new citizen may have learnt to shake hands with the servant, but that doesn't mean they will acquire this habit afterwards
I see what you mean and I feel awkward as a Russian when that's happening
Cats personally, cats nationally (by a huge margin)
We have the biggest number of cats per capita in the world afaik
I like dogs more but I think that cats are more popular
Well, it's cultural, cats have been considered good luck in Russia for centuries and even letting a cat into a new house before the humans move in is said to bring good luck
They have always been favored pets in Russia, maybe they just fit us more in a cultural sense, those arrogant assholes lol
Also, it may have something to do with living conditions, most people live in apartments in relatively dense urban areas so having a dog is a pain in the ass
Cats are group animals too
Stray cats live in groups
For Russia, the full list can be quite long
Despite the fact that only "Russian" is the official language in the whole country, there are other 35 national languages that have official state in different regions (since Russia is a Federation) and over 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today
Vepsian - lesser known Finnic language
Balachka - language of the Cossacks
Siberian Polish - mostly dead language from people deported there during Russian Empire that for some odd reason liked it and didn't go home
And also ZF (dirigibles and gearboxes)
People know ABB, though
Overcurrent protection switches by ABB are common
Oh, right, I mixed up my Bodensee towns
Do you not maintain electric lines inside your apartment/house yourself
Jesus Christ
What about plumbing
Or actually building an extension to your house
>Public transportation in Ukraine is shit
Even in Kyiv
I live in Moscow which is about 900yo, and Moscow center is all about history
They also dig a lot (subway and other construction stuff) so permanently find something here and there
Literally nothing aside from “EU exists”. Not even much bullshit on the state tv
They occasionally mention EU in some way or another, sometimes slightly stirring the picture to cast shade at it, and that’s about it
I usually pay with bank card
Social card in Moscow doubles as a monthly pass (with subway included, around 8$), credit card and an ID for social benefits
Rest use Troika card, in which you can put either a deposit or a pre-paid abonement
Almost every bus/tram/trolley has wireless receiver to pay with card or NFC
Just don't ask me stupid questions after you've heard something about Russia in the news
I have a normal human life just like other people on the planet
Any political, like "Do you (option: Do Russians) like Putin
" or too much personal like "What's you salary
Well, don't you have a joke like this
\- Hey John, why are you so good with chicks
\- Ok Bob, when I meet a chick I just ask: "Would you please fuck with me
\- But John, that's the way you get a punch in the face
\- Well, sometimes you got punched and sometimes you fuck
>Don't and I repeat don't use that one (swear) word you know in Polish
Ha, you know what
First time I heard that word (in combination with  *mać* ) was when I was in school, soviet times, watching a movie "*Seksmisja"* (that somehow didn't had 18+ limitation)
It sounds funny in Russian, also offensive, but quite
exoctic
Do I look like an American spy to you to hang out with grizzlies
Lol
Not authentic enough
Everyone should've been wearing an Adidas tracksuit
Frankly speaking, thanks God, it doesn't sound bad being converted into euros as well, but there actually two sides: some people think those Russians (Moscowites) who can afford travel to Europe are rich, and quite opposite: Russians have this GDP per capita and therefore are poor
So answering the question may insult either :^-)))
>It wasn't translated
It was multi-voice translated of course (or even dubbed -- don't remember)
But that very loud exclamation in Polish was not silenced so everyone hear it
> Actually, I think the way it was used in Seksmisja was great
Yes, that was applied quite understandable and emotionally right way
After watching the movie, we were discussing -- "Hey did you hear what he said
That's how they curse, hahaha"
Kinda related: I’ve heard that during the Chechen wars, “Chekh” (or “Czech) was one of the slang terms for Chechens among our troops
In Russia we get a new law that obligstes shops to clearly mark dairy productd if they contain milk fat replacers
And I see those labels in my local shops
Not sure how it helps))) And my personal favorite thing we have pretty cold July and I hope August))
We're finally switching to electronic nationwide IDs instead of internal paper passports
The process should start in 2020 and be over by 2022
Some may not deem this positive — depends on one's level of surveillance state paranoia
We may have the most nuclear weapons in the world
In Russia you don’t have positive news
That’s it, you just don’t.
Belarussians, rise up
We'd keep stabbing Ukraine in the leg under the table after swiping all of the meat off their plate; pretend Poland isn't there and try and hang around with Belarus, Romania and Serbia
Russia would get drunk and start talking about how good it was under communism
Russia coming to the Baltic countries table
And then happily cycle home despite having more than a few beers
We each steal half your dinner and let you pay for it
With knives in your both hands
You answered your own question
> Stop stealing from my plate
Never
(ง'̀-'́)ง  (In all seriousness, if I had it my way -- we'd never have even tried
It hasn't been worth what's come since
My experience with Polish people says otherwise
Though granted, they were drunk
Greece and the Balkans please
Serbian and Bosnian meat dishes are awesome
[Hmm]
No, THAT SHOULD BE FRANCE
I can literally imagine all the Latin countries gifting a bottle of wine to each other and acting like they're touched, and then tipping all of it down the toilet when they get home
What about with Turkey
Buckfast tastes like shit, and I've drank some really suspect stuff over the years
That Russia is European
Obvs highly subjective but don't group us in with euro lot
>She honestly believed and thought that up to 80-90% of dutch men were gay
Apparently because of all the gay propaganda we have to endure in NL we all turned gay and the dutch public has to pay us to mate or we go extinct
I think she was joking with you
Cause otherwise this story sounds completely unbelievable to me, it's just too ridiculous
Leaving everything else aside, you probably met this 18 year old girl outside of Russia and you were talking English with her, right
This is not the demographic that would seriously believe this kind of stuff
Hell, this isn't even what Russian state tv would be broadcasting about the Netherlands anyway
Why is it called Burglaria then
>could relate a bit
Серьезно? Это ж совершенно клюквенный рассказ.
Asians, most of whom are in-denial
*To be fair*, this still reads like a fantasy to me
And, uh, I do have an idea of what our state tv has to offer, "80-90% of dutch men were gay
Apparently because of all the gay propaganda we have to endure in NL we all turned gay and the dutch public has to pay us to mate or we go extinct" is not it
Not like 18 year olds are intently soaking up those political tv shows anyway
Seriously, the only way this story becomes believable to me is if she was pulling his leg
Otherwise, nope
The fact that this is so highly upvoted with no critical thought at all is upsetting to me
Looks like people are simply going "haha, those dumb Russian animals will believe anything".
>But I distinctly remember during the Ukrainian revolt that Russian media first went with "they are degenerates and homosexuals", and when that didn't work (because how could homosexuals be so brave
I'm not sure, what you're trying to say here
That Russian media (who exactly
channel one
rossiya
) first claimed that those protestors camped out on the maidan were gay
Er, right
I'm sure you can provide evidence of this claim
Cause google isn't helping me here
Again, you guys have some strange caricaturistic ideas about what Russian propaganda puts out
Like this hilarious story about 90% of Ducth men being gay due to homosexual propaganda and society having to pay them to mate
People here swallow up this simplistic bullshit, because they will believe anything about Russians
But no, this isn't what Russia state media is actually trying to indoctrinate us with
I really liked the song "Sisters" by Pain of Salvation — the melody, transition to chorus, Gildenlöw's vocals — but never paid much attention to lyrics, enjoying scarcely perceptible motifs of sadness and loss
And then I finally got to read the actual lyrics
Yeah, Daniel, thanks for ruining otherwise perfect song
I guess this is more about not knowing the cultural context of a song, but kne of the funniest sights I've seen in my life took place one evening in Russia at some seedy bar (the dark kind of place you go when you're already drunk) at 2am
YMCA came on and every big butch Russian guy in the joint started singing along and doing the dance with a great deal of enthusiasm
They didn't know it's a gay anthem
Yes
Camps is where most of Russians try their first alcohol and have first sex
Yes I went every summer
Mostly to South Russia and Ukraine
Where do you find free camps
I hadn't seen them for ages
All camps I see are so fucking expensive
Once a year
The recommendation is twice per year, I suppose
I always plan to follow this recommendation, but continue to find reasons not to go
Capital punishment was abolished in Russia in 1997, as one of the key conditions for joining the Council of Europe
It still has significant support among the population (about 50%), and there are many politicians and other public people openly expressing support for reestablishing it
Capital punishment wasn't completely abolished in Russia yet, but in 1996 a moratorium was placed (a demand from Council of Europe in order to accept Russia)
There are five crimes in which capital punishment could have been used if not for this moratorium, and as far as I know, all five crimes are either very heinous types of murder (such as genocide) or murders of special people (such as authorities)
Polls show that many people would support returning death penalty
First, we've actually just got 10 days off due to COVID (or that's just how I understand it)
Second, yes, we'd get a day off on Monday either way
It’s a day off in Russia, yes
And for many people this whole week is off, but that depends on the employer
It is in Russia
Also next four days are - but not for everyone
Schools and those who work for government will have days off
Well, here it's normal to take a bath or a shower at least once a day, and many people do that twice a day (in the morning and at night)
And we're a pretty cold country for half of the year
In summer, I'll normally take a third shower in the middle of the day if I happen to be near home, but I don't know if many people do the same
If we're talking about actually taking a full bath, I indulge myself a few times a week, and that seems to be something that most of my family do as well (up to grandparents on both sides of the family), but afaik most people don't really care for soaking
I'd say North Caucasus in general and Chechnya in particular
That place just feels eerie and dangerous
I've never even met anyone, who would seriously consider going to Chechnya
Other Caucasian regions aren't that scary really
We just joke about them mostly, although those jokes can often get racist
Also Moscow and Muscovites
I feel like half the country hates us, another half laughs at us, all while a third half wants to live here
Funny thing though, many Muscovites themselves look down on Moscow
It varies, but generally no
To me only Chechnya seems foreign
Often it's quite on the contrary, many people perceive regions that are not part of Russia as "ours". Usually these are the same people who say it's okay to attack other countries and steal their land because "it was ours in the first place".
Moscow metropolitan area (Moscow + Moscow Oblast) - 20 mln, about 14% of total Russian population
In the beginning of 20th century the population of Moscow was a bit over 1 million, and since then Moscow is the melting pot of Russia with lots of opportunities and crazy competition
GDP per capita is the highest in Russia and the standards of living is closer to Western Europe than to the rest of Russia
Petersburg - 5 mln
The capital of Russian Empire
Founded by Peter The Great in 1703 on lands conquered from the Swedes 18 years before the peace treaty that ended the war
Today St
Petersburg is considered as the culture capital of Russia, and the second city of Russia in all other aspects
Residents consider themselves as clever people of high culture, which is true to some degree
Novosibirsk - 1,6 mln
Industrial city with scientific research centers and academic institutions in Academgorodok district (founded in 1950s)
Novosibirsk, unlike Moscow and St
Petersburg, is a subsidized region that receives more from the federal budget than it gives
Moscow (12 506 468)
Petersburg (5 351 935)
Novosibirsk (1 612 833)
Novosibirsk is known for being a city full of intelligent people with big scientific institutions
Because all of the covicted smart people sent to Siberia during the last century
Also very cold weather in winter and hot in summer
Petersburg is known for all the intelligent and cultural but melancholic people
Even thugs there are very cultural and will say thank you after they mug you
Moscow is the reason in these cities problems, because they suck out the blood from these cities and people live is a hipster and gay or a bimbo
> Therefore it feels a bit like an overdimensional village
Truer words have never been spoken about Munich
> St
Petersburg - 5 mln
The capital of Russian Empire
Founded by Peter The Great in 1703 on lands conquered from the Swedes 18 years before the peace treaty that ended the war
Today St
Petersburg is considered as the culture capital of Russia, and the second city of Russia in all other aspects
Residents consider themselves as clever people of high culture, which is true to some degree
They also managed to get a new memetic title a few years back: the city of dismemberment
A few well-publicized crimes happened there a few years back, including a professor of history (it's the cultural capital, after all
) being caught with arms of his student lover in his backpack, so now every time something gruesome happens there people just shrug, because of course it's happened in St
Petersburg
I believe we, people of neighbouring countries, should visit each other as much as possible
Tourism is really eye-opening, while governments come and go (sometimes not very fast)
> Was that some subtle shade
Yes
A Muscovite arrives in St
Petersburg, goes to the house he's rented an apartment in, calls the elevator, the elevator arrives, the doors open and there's a man there squatting and taking a dump
The Muscovite is stunned with his mouth open, so the local replies (*use your best St
Petersburger snob impression*), "I don't know where you're from, but *here* it is considered polite to greet the other people in the elevator
I wouldn't say that typical inhabitant of Kupchino district in Spb is any different from a person from Chertanovo in Moscow
Yes, we do, often without rhyme or reason
Like, most rulers get a Russian version of their latinised name, but Iberian ones don't (Энрике, not Генрих)
Princes don't either
For instance queen Elizabeth becomes Elizaveta in Russian
French emperors called Louis are Ludovik's in Russian
You translate all Russian names, don't you
Like we translate all Ukrainian ones
Moscow and Saint Peters are the beauties cities I’ve seen
Russian lad speaking about Russia impartially
Kek
THAT is truly anecdotal
What places in northern Spain would you recommend to visit
Can relate to that
Those who like to point their accusing finger on people like you just don't understand how painful it is to highlight all the negative stuff just because truth has to be said
I tend to agree with all being said, however the situation is highly uneven
Some people are ok, some don't give a damn, some would be passive-agressive, some openly abusive
I could never say which category is the majority
Probably the passive-agressive one
I try to imagine a hypothetical situations with a gay man trying to hookup with some random guy at a bar
In approximately 20% of cases I see the gay one being punched in the face
I'd give 60% for polite rejection, 10% for not so polite rejection and 10% for glimpse of interest in the eyes of the random guy
But that's my assumption only
And one should bare in mind that I'm speaking about big cities, like Moscow, SP or Krasnodar
Not when you adopt a kid, as the recent story shows
The story is absolute nuts, I really hope it will somehow end good for them :( Though at the same time, guys lived semi-openly with fostered children for something like 8-9 years and only now got in wrong place in wrong time
Neighbours were ok with them, fostering agency was ok with them, colleagues were ok with them, one of children even told police before that he has two dads and nothing happened that time
But it took one asshole doctor and some officials wanting a promotion on a juicy theme to ruin it
Maybe this story will change something, if it'll be loud enough
In Russian it's initially a log, a round chunk of wood you make firewood from
It's still used in this meaning but not so often in the cities where you don't have a need in firewood
As a slur it started as "dumb" probably, we have lots of variations of "stupid like a wood" or "someone's head is made of wood, if you knock on it, it will make a typical wooden sound" in culture
Newcomers from Central Asia often didn't know the language and didn't understand things, so they were perceived as dumb
As a person who came back 3 weeks ago from a village in the middle of Siberian after visiting my extended family, I would say that you're not too wrong
It does look like 3rd world in some ways
But, for instance, almost every household from my native village has 2 cars (usually Japanese) with a house and a couple of acres of land and the nature around is absolutely pristine - like, we drove 2 kilometers away from the village and drank totally clear water from a lake surrounded by a premordial forest
It is a far cry from Africa or Bangladesh, where people don't have water and the air is so bad you can get a cancer by just looking at the picture of the capital

Can’t say all their songs are awesome bot this is worth listening
Well, why was
He currently is
Ivan the Terrible
\- He founded 155 cities and fortresses, built 40 churches and 60 monasteries, created a state post office
general election of the local administration was introduced,
\- A large-scale reform of legal proceedings was carried out,
\- Many public schools founded
\- Typography began
\- Development of Siberia began,
\- The oprichnina king inflicted a severe blow to the princely-boyar oligarchy
\-Almost 2 times increased the territory of the country
&#x200B;
What a terrible, terrible ruler
He was not the best, but in the shortest possible time to put the backward agrarian country on the rails of industrialization, win the great patriotic war, and then again raise the country from ruins is not so easy
Well all you said about Stalin may apply for Putin
He just use more progressive ways to "control" opposition than just murdering it
About Yeltsin
to me he was nothing but the last real politician in Russia
He was already a politician in the USSR
And his beginning of rule was quite alright
But then FSB and oligarchs started conquering the country and pushed him too much
I think that's his problem
I believe he wasn't insane
He did too much good to be considered insane
From my point of view his insanity was nothing comparing to other absolute monarchs
Yeah, but he rewrites constitution anytime he wants
He rules the country for 19 years
4 times "elected" president while constitution allowed just 2
He even increased presidential term
He killed any possible opposition and strong politicians to be surrounded by a bunch of friends, relatives and oligarchs
He's so afraid of any competition that he simply denies people right to be elected
Just because
99% of the defendants are found guilty because cops don't even start investigating "dead" cases
1% - corrupted state workers and oligarchs
Talking about being the strongest
Average salary is somewhere around 200 euros
Old and disabled people mostly get around 70-100 euros
Teacher's and doctor's salaries are also around 100 euros
Strong enough
Strongest by which metric
I don't think any country sees Russia as anything but monkey with nukes or a gas station
All of that doesn't make him less insane
Also Siberia was inhabited before him, you know
He kinda fought it's residents to take their homeland
I always laugh when people say that Ivan "developed" Siberia and "doubled the size" of Russia
He slaughtered and raped native Siberians into submission
And to this day "developed" Siberia is about 20% inhabited at best
> - The oprichnina king inflicted a severe blow to the princely-boyar oligarchy
Yay for absolutism that would haunt Russia for centuries
> -Almost 2 times increased the territory of the country
Slaughtered, raped, and killed (just because other countries did it doesn't mean it's a cause to celebrate) Not to mention the disastrous and costly Livonian War
Now I do like the guy all things considered (a lot better than future monarchs) but he was literally insane
He killed his heir accidentally in a brawl (and was really remorseful and horrified afterwards)
Alltime crazyhead of Russia though was Peter the ~~Traitor~~ Great
Stalin was ruthless, not mad
So were both Americas, Australia, Africa, Britan and all other parts of the world
Expansion always causes it
Then let's write all the Roman generals and colonialists of America in the ranks of the madmen
I don't said it was good, but the same, as others conquerors
But the fact that since the 16th century most of Siberia has not been populated is no longer the fault of Ivan IV
I don’t know why in English it sounds "terrible", in russian it is closer to "redoubted". He was a tough guy, not the bad
...and in all of the rest republics
Some of these crimes were neccessary for progress of young countries, some were simple mistakes of inexperienced politicians
He also conquered half of territories of current Ukraine
Rebuild so much that to this day country with biggest reserves of natural resources can't produce anything but weapons, eastern regions basically sold off to China, rampant corruption, demographic crisis and dozen other problems that are not on the agenda, but for those US and Ukraine of course to blame
I prefer the version that it was just stupid resources management
There was bad crop year in most of regions in most of regions of the USSR
Additionally for some reason grain export was increased
The state tried to fix the situation by crops of the western-southern territories
If you check increase in mortality during starvation in 1932-1933 then you that the biggest one was in Kazakhstan, then Ukraine and Russia
Even in Moscow and Leningrad people felt lack of grain
But Ukrainian propaganda loves to use golodomor as an act of genocide by evil Russians
In modern times, I would say it was corruption trial for Minister of economics development Ulyukayev in 2016, ended 2018 with final sentencing him to 8 years serving in corrective colony (sort of a prison)
There were a handful of those, a whole series of trials for a number of governors about  corruption, but Ulyukaev's case was very much hyped in media, due to his high rank
What do Germans think about the "consensual cannibalism" case of Armin Meiwes
Do they agree with the outcome
No, I'm pretty sure that you can't change "Spasibo" in any way, but you can add a (pro)noun in dative after it if you want to specify who or what are you thanking: "Spasibo tebe" - Thanks to you, "Spasibo im" - Thanks to them, "Spasibo Mashe" - Thanks to Masha, etc
Russian
Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol - proze
Pushkin, Lermontov, Nekrasov - poetry
More than those, but the above is sort of a must
Wow, Divine Comedy is great, but it seemed to me as not for, say, not yet adult brains
And don’t forget 20th century poetry and prose: Bulgakov, Block, Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mayakovsky and so on
We also study foreign literature starting from Ancient Greece and move on to Shakespeare, Hugo, Byron, Moliere etc
and even some fun stuff like modern SF, Bradbury as an example
[someone made a list on Goodreads ] but it lacks a lot of books we had to read
Interesting, I've read about 60 of those 100 (some are repeated in the lust though)
Of course, those very detailed stuff is attrative
frankly speaking, I read this in 9th or 10th (last) year while in school so yes, I have to dismiss my previos statement
And yes, I have then lost an interest after purgatory, returned to heaven being an adult
A fuckton
Бутерброд or Butterbrot
A favored snack here,
Though not really a word more a food I suppose
Gastarbeiter,zugzwang,used to add -burg ending to russian cities
Ukrainians use even more of them
Things like a roof, an onion, paint are all Germanisms there
Similar in Russian, but we use male version, богомол (bogomol)
Как же вы заебали со своими советскими шуточками, хоспаде
Probably Kalinka or Katyusha
Also Tetris theme song - Korobeiniki
Stereotypes/ Thinking that everybody supports Putin/ Calling us commies/comrades
I don't find it funny
With kangaroos
Yeah, I mean, I support you guys :)
Get it back
No, he's from the Netherlands (cos you don't know from which region exactly), but he is Dutch (not Danish)
So, do they
That's exactly what i said, we dont know the region
Some were shot, some were sent to labor camps for many years
Some were lynched
Depended on the severity of how much you collaborated
and how Stalin was feeling on that particular day
A lot of the people we punished for being collaborators were just soldiers who were captured after being encircled or something
As far as the Communist Party was concerned; if you were captured you obviously didn't care enough about your homeland to go down fighting, taking at least one German with you
But yeah, if it was surrendering -- you went to the camps (if you survived the open air camps the Germans put you in originally to starve to death)
If you fought for them, you were shot
Not very kindly, although a few SS members did get away with it
Not for that many years
Former collaborators, especially Western Ukrainians, started most of the post-war prison riots
This made labour camps economically infeasible, as the authorities needed too many standing troops in godforsaken frozen shitholes
Those still incarcerated were amnestied in 1955, just 10 years after the end of the war
I'm just looking at all these answers thinking that I need to move abroad
I get basically nothing extra from my job (it is a start-up so I guess it's to be expected)
Lucky b*stards
I'm a researcher in an institution under the Russian Academy of Sciences
I've ever used only one benefit so far:
* Access to additional health care for me and the members of my family in the building right next to mine, without any queues
There are some other benefits:
* Free apartments or significant discounts on apartments for young employees who don't own property in the city yet
* Kindergarten in the same building as my workplace
* A small gym in the building
There are also yoga sessions with an instructor, I believe
* Discounts on trips to the local recreation center owned by my institution
* Occasional free tickets to excursions, concerts and so on
Freedom to choose my work schedule or even not appear at work if I don't feel like it is an additional unofficial benefit
Not technically a benefit of my employer in particular, but as a person with the PhD degree, I'm subject to 50% more vacation days than ordinary people, which results in 42 vacation days per year in total
Not that I use them anyway, though
9 extra days off, lunch allowance, health insurance
Phone, lunches and dinners, office gym, free taxi if you stay at work past 10pm, occasional free tickets to theaters, and of course private health insurance
There're plenty of both Russian and foreign companies offering comparable benefits in Russia
No need to move abroad

We have ten vowel letters: а е ё и о у ы э ю я, I can't think of a word that contains all of them
Anyone who knows at least a bit about linguistics knows that it doesn't prescribe "correct" word usage
Venezuelan one is one of the easiest imo
It's the other way around from me, Spain Spanish is very difficult especially from Andaluthia and southern Spain
Whereas most Latin accents are very easy
In Peru and Chile weon is an actual thing, might be derived from huevon, but it took on a completely diferrent meaning
Means something like "bro" or "dude"
May 9, 1945 aka the Victory Day
It's a state religion at this point and perhaps the sole foundation of the nation
Холодец/Holodec (Aspic)
It’s a popular dish in Russia often served on celebrations
I like sweet jellies or gelatin desserts, but fuck Aspic
Borscht
I just hate vegetables except for carrots and cabbage
Porridge
I can eat buckwheat porridge and maybe rice porridge with coconut milk and a lot of fruit, but everything else is vile: oatmeal, pearl barley, semolina, millet
Crab salad, which is rice, chopped boiled eggs, FAKE crab, canned corn and mayo
It's a fucking staple these days and I hate it
Окрошка (okroshka) and холодец (kholodets)
I'm pretty much sure that almost every single Russian hates these foods, but for some apparent reason they are still pretty popular, and they're cooked for special events, like New Year or Birthday
>traditional Swedish casserole made of potatoes, onions, pickled sprats, bread crumbs and cream
I've never had this but it sounds delicious
Russians start nodding from moving head up and then down
I dunno how how long ago we started doing it, but we did it in USSR times to

The State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg is the best in Russia and one of the best in the world
If you're going to visit, don't miss the General Staff building (right in front of the Winter Palace), it's a part of the museum and it's beautiful
Peterhoff and the Catherine Palace are spectacular and worth a visit
In Moscow the best museums are: Moscow Kremlin Museums (Kremlin Armoury and Diamond Fund in the first place), State Historical Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics, State Darwin Museum and Paleontological Museum
Very prevalent - we have 790 KFCs (and only 693 McDonaldses)
I prefer KFC as well, and most people see it as a best of three big fastfood chains
There are loads of them, just like McDonalds and BK
Really popular and there are many restaurants here
Fun fact: there are (or were, not sure) at least 2 restaurants in Grozniy (Chechnya) called CFC (Chechen Fried Chicken) which is pretty much just a regular KFC, because international franchises don't want/can't to operate in Chechnya and Crimea
It also has a fascinating history: the local franchise was planned to be opened in the early nineties, but as soon as they received the know-how about operating fried chicken fast food joints, they severed all ties with Yum
and launched under their own brand, Rostik's.
In 2010 the owner of Rostik's actually sold the franchise to Yum
, effectively milking them twice
All post Soviet countries
Turkey, especially due to how many times we clashed during history
Whether they like it or not they have to be conscious of the overwhelming role we play in their lands
Poland becoming stronger
You're not post Soviet, you just have victim complex + self aggrandizement
Whatever makes you feel great man
You can have something against Russia and you'd have good reason for it
But this was about actual post Soviet countries and you just butted in lol, that's clear victim complex and self aggrandizement
But he wasn't talking about you to begin with
Chill, you aren't considered a neighbour
"The worst part about being poor in Switzerland, however, has to do with human psychology
In a country where you are surrounded by well-off people, barely scraping by REALLY sucks
You're right, this is an excellent point
Being poor in a poor country just makes you average
But being poor, surrounded entirely by wealthy people, means that you're an outcast
Yes same thing with my family in Russia
We had much less than in the US, but it didn't feel like it because everyone had the same amount
In the US you can make a lot of money, but if you live in a place like Washington DC or NYC or San Francisco, you can never truly be comfortable financially due to the insane cost of things
How much does life in the capital of your country differ from live outside of it
I have never been in any European country, but this is my dream
I will be able to meet you and show you a lot of wonderful places in region I live
Also, I can suggest you nice hotel to stay in my town
I’m a manager of that hotel
Probably Chechnya
It's a conflict temporarily halted by giving a lot of money to the ruling criminal gang in exchange for their loyalty
I'm not sure how long this status quo can last, but it seems fundamentally unstable
It's difficult to measure separatist movements in Russia, as separatism is criminalized and may result in real prison terms for participants, so people are very unlikely to express their feelings even if they have some
So who knows what might surface if/when the current Russian power vertical collapses
The best we have is making educated guesses
Most republic are generally too small and integrated into Russia to have significant separatism movements
Bashkortostan and Tatarstan are deep in the Russian territory and would always be heavily dependent on Russia, so separatism is economically unsound
They also have many Russians living there
Any separation is guaranteed to become a shitshow, so I don't think it will happen
Karels perhaps could have reasons to want merging with Finland instead of Russia (more similar language and culture, territories which have been part of Finland not so long ago), but Karelia is 80% Russians
Kaliningrad as an exclave has the most economic prerequisites for separatism, but it's overwhelmingly Russian, so it lacks some national self-identification for that
Another extremely difficult region is Crimea
As it is considered occupied by Russia in Ukraine, not recognized internationally, and heavily sanctioned, it's the region with the most political prerequisites for separatism
However, it's also majorly Russian, and I can't see it wanting to separate
I personally think it'll be in a contested state and a major pain in the ass both for Russia and for Ukraine for decades to come, but Russia and Ukraine will eventually make some deal in the future which will make Crimea officially Russian in exchange for something
I think for the real chance of separatism of a small part of Russia, it needs to have a combination of factors: to be at the Russian border, to have the majority not identifying as ethnic Russians, and to be poorly integrated into Russian institutions
I believe the only fitting regions are Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and Tuva
These are the only regions I could see separating during my lifespan
Chechnya is the most likely one, as it is already a de facto separate state with its own ruling hierarchy, uncontrollable army, and unofficial "laws" which contradict the Russian legislation
The [Kuril Islands situation] is not about separatism, but I'm fairly positive it will be solved during my lifespan, and Russia will cede some part of them to Japan in a mutual treaty
There is some chance for large-scale separatism in the future (like some people proposing the Ural Republic or the Far East Republic)
But I think it's more likely to result in some federalization and greater autonomy rather than complete independence, as these regions are economically and culturally linked to the European Russia and are way to sparsely populated to be completely independent nations
Some places have that problem (stray dogs), to the degree of real danger to kids and eldery
Blue is definitely the most common
In secondary education, some teachers take it quite seriously and won't allow any other colours to be used in class or assignments
Same here, haha
But some of our teachers didn't even let us use black pens, which doesn't make sense imo
The 'standard' is blue
It can be violet-ish as long as it's blue enough
When I was a kid, only the hosting parents would stay with us or sometimes we'd be completely on our own
I'd be embarrassed if my parents were present too, haha
Bit of both
It really depends on how well the parents know each other
When I was a toddler I was considered a friend of the children that were in the same ward as my mom, so the moms spent every birthday party together
My wife's mother was a good friend with her school friends' mother, so they always had an adult party of their own
When I had birthday parties of my own, the kids came alone
> I have a bonus question: is it common in other countries to have one “kid birthday” with friends as described in this post and then another “adult birthday”/“family birthday” with family
Yeah, it's super common here
I'd normally celebrate my birthday separately with friends, with my mum, with my dad, with my maternal grandparents, with my paternal side of the family, and with my uncle
So there was always a week worth of celebrations lol
Hope I haven't forgotten anyone
I am a simple man, I like a breakfast club sandwich (with an egg)

Plus I can't tolerate the language the Swiss dare to call German
Local trains are 2-3₽/km (0
022-0
033€/km), guess it's quite cheap by European standards
Long distance trains have varying prices, but usually in the same range
For example, 650 km from St
Petersburg to Moscow is 20-40€ in 2nd class sleeper and 30-50€ in high speed train
Downside is that the number of trains is limited compared to Western Europe, because of low population density and the idea that trains must be close to 100% booked to keep the prices low enough
In Russia it depends
Metro train in moscow costs 42 rubles (0
5 euro) and you can spend there whole day exploring >500 km of subway and surface lines if you like
Suburban rail cost depends on the distance and the type of a train, the most expensive ticket for over 100 km will cost you about 5 euro
Prices for inter-city rails vary greatly
High speed train from Moscow to Saint Petersburg (3,5 hours) would cost you 30 euro for economy seat
The most inexpensive train with a sit is about 10 euro, night train with a sleeping place is about 20 euro
The most expensive ticket from Moscow to Spb costs 400 euro, for this money you'll get a double bed with massage and remote control, shower and toilet in the compartment, TV, individual air conditioning, closet, safe, WiFi, dinner and breakfast, transfer by business class car
If you're really into long distance journeys, you can take a train to Vladivostok
6 days trip for as much as 80 euro is a steal
In Russia 40€ per 1000 km should be a pretty fair deal , if you have the ability to put up with three more neighbors in a train compartment , and 115€ if you wanna have just one more interlocutor in the room except your own self
But sometimes you can have a flight on the same distance for almost the same amount of money as a railroad trip
Some conditions could be pretty harsh though like you can’t have any luggage other then your carry-on stuff .
Constitutional court is in Saint Petersburg
War and Peace ofc
Tho the thing is I haven't read a single book from my program so
idc
"What is to be done
" by Chernyshevsky
I have read almost everything that was required in school but this one I somehow escaped
I remember that I tried but just couldn't get interested, it was kinda social philosophy in a poor disguise of novel and not very well written too, all this socialism, communes and dreams of Vera Pavlovna
So goddamn boring
I even always mix up Chernyshevsky with Herzen
Also, tried to read "Oblomov" by Goncharov not one but few times and every time I loved the beginning and got inevitably stuck somewhere in the middle
I should probably return and try one more time eventually
You can practically learn french by reading War and Peace
After dissolution of Soviet Union, the communist friendly word "tovaristch" ("comrade") is kinda replaced by an old "gospodin" or "gospoja", which are equal to "sir" and "madam" accordingly by meaning, but literally can be translated as "master"/"mistress" (absolutely communist unfriendly, hence the word being out of modern language for a few decades)
Certainly not lost, today "tovaristch" is akin to a "mate", often implying that a person shares an involvement in same activity or job
You might not be exactly friends with them, but if you share a field of work or a project, together you're likely to be  called "tovaristch".
About a month ago I've read a post on r/tifu where a guy forgot the word "celery" in a restaurant and had to describe his order as "green crunchy sticks" while looking and feeling pretty dumb (in his words)
I had a good laugh about it, only to realise that I forgot what is the word for "celery" in Russian and tried my hardest to remember it for the rest of the day without looking it up in a dictionary
By the time I finally recalled it I felt like both incredibly smart and stupid at once
Now I'm studying third language, should go down well :D
Yes, knew the word in English but couldn't remember how to translate it back into russian
I've actually come to appreciate Finnish quite a bit
I like listening to Finnish music even if I don't understand a word of it
Icelandic, because Vikings n' shit
Everything to do with stressing
Especially with the loanwords
The word "millennial" for some reason has the stress on the last syllable in Russian, which sounds awful if you're used to reading it in English
Also academically correct stressing is usually not the same as colloquially accepted, thus there are a lot of opportunities for snobs to correct you
Edit: oh and we do have a word "millennium" which has a stress on the correct syllable
Stresses like to dance all around the words here
I guess it's connected more with courtesy than with language, but it still annoys me
Pronoun "ti" used when you addressing to one person, and pronoun "vi" when you addressing to two or more people
But you need to say "vi" when you addresing to ONE person but with big authority
I think the same thing in Ukrainian and Belarusian, but I'm not sure
We have the same problem in Russian, although people usually put it when it matters (все - everyone vs всё - everything)
Real problems are with names: there are names (like Артём) and surnames which have ë in them, but when filling in the birth certificate parents may or may not put it in, which may lead to errors in documents
I don't know about French, but I think that in Russian people started use polite form when it came from French
Aristocracy used to speak French a lot
And yes, formal "vi" is often used
• Ukraine: That’s the plan, har har har
• Belarus: Nothing changes
• Kazakhstan: Nothing changes
• Poland: *Lzhedmitriy flashbacks*
• Estonia and other Baltic countries: Solves the problem with Russian minorities therein
Creates innumerably more problems
• Finland and Norway: PLEASE
• Mongolia: *Golden Horde intensifies*
• China: An unstoppable industrial empire with complete disregard for individuals
Goodbye Internyet
• Japan: Solves the Kurils dispute
We also get quality sushi
• USA: The more rabid conservatives in both countries either destroy each other or find someone else to hate
EDIT:
• North Korea: That’s a nice planet you’ve got there
Would be a shame if someone nuked the hell out of it
I thinkn our government is already trying to merge is with Ukraine
So as you see it's not a happy marriage at all
Also most of our neighbors were previously part of: Finland, all former USSR republics
China, Norway, North Korea and Mongola are the only our neighbors who weren't part of Russia
12 out of 16 neighbors were part of an empire
Most of them won't be happy to get on the old track
> edit- what do countries with multiple borders do
That's the question here
*heavy breathing in Russian*
>Belarus – Grand Republic of Lithuania 2
We will throw out Russian language
Good luck, lol, given that more than a half of the potential united state now speaks Russian as primary everyday language
I've done it (several times actually, as part of my then job), and let me tell you, even with work to be done over the course of the journey, it's fairly boring
Nothing really happens and the scenery isn't even *that* good - there is a lot of industry next to the railroad
Georgia - nothing changes, but South Ossetia and Abhazia join the new country
Azerbaijan - did you know there's an Azeri minority in Iran that needs protection
Turkey - Erdoğan and Putin must oil wrestle for presidency
Our combined navy upsets the balance of power in the Med
Iran gets really nervous as well
Russian men protest the merger, fearing they won't gets any pussy now
Democratic lustrations of unloyal population up to democratic ethnic cleansing and contained and strictly controlled democratic genocide is the way to go
*\*Changeover Day intensifies\**
Do many Finns know Swedish
I thought that nowadays almost nobody speaks it there
I have a similar one, as a kid I thought Russia and Germany had a border because WW2 propaganda is *so* omnipresent even in modern Russia (even in the relatively liberal period I grew up in)
Impressive for 8 years old to realise it on their own
Usually not
Maybe when the gathering is big enough that you have to rent a banquet room
If the family gathering is small enough to fit into an apartment then there's probably not enough kids and more importantly, no spare tables
Yeah it's a bit odd
Seen as low-class
The numbers themselves aren't bad, but let's say you want to say how many "houses" there are:
* 1 дом = 1 house
* 2/3/4 до́ма = 2/3/4 **of** house
* 5-20 домов = 5-20 **of** house**s**
* дома́ = house**s**
Etc
So basically you have to use different grammatical case-number forms of the noun with different numbers
Our number structure is the same as the English one, at least something to make the life easier
Why is the switch on 16
Latin had prefix for 17 as well (septendecim), right
Normal Slavic languages:
* czterdzieści, čtyřicet, četrdeset, četirideset
Eastern Slavic languages:
* sorok/sorak
Yeah, I've also read something about that but don't remember shit, haha
Forgot to say that "1" is different for masculine, feminine & neuter ("один", "одна", "одно"), and "2" for masculine/neuter & feminine ("два", "две")
Other numbers don't change for gender
Yeah, same with человек/люди and 21
Russian has "only" 6 cases that are presented in grammar textbooks
But it also has:
1) the new vocative case for a fairly large group of nouns (mostly names but not only)
2) up to 3 distinct locative cases for some nouns;  the one for "where to" is different from the accusative, the one for "where at" is different from the prepositional, and the one for "where from" is different from the genitive
3) the partitive case for some nouns that is different from the genitive
4) the translative case is used with a number of verbs indicating a change of state (like in English: "to run for president", "to enroll into the actors")
5) separate forms for some units of measurement when used with a number
(the 4th and 5th coincide with some forms of the normal 6 cases but it wouldn't make sense to ignore them)
Reddit is nowhere near popular here, and English is spoken by less than 5% of the population
We live in a Russian speaking bubble just like Americans in English
I'm not surprised
It is a bubble, just a larger one than Russian
Anna German too
Mor ve Ötesi
I know they were on a Eurovision and they also have a small fanbase in Russia
It’s not ok if you speak to strangers in Russia
It’s usually perceived like the person needs something if he talks to you, whether info or something material
We are very closed in ourselves and only speak in case of emergency
I've seen this topic brought up quite a few times on here and elsewhere
It seems to be a real game changer that turns France from the world capital of hostility to a very warm and sociable place
Good to know that in advance
Out of the new stuff my son watches, I like *Orange Cow*. It doesn't have the production values of Masha, but unlike 99% of family sitcoms it doesn't feature a useless dad
Not the same language but Slavonic languages tend to have same word roots with different meanings
So every Russian in Czechia will notice signs "Pozor, policie varuje" and laugh his ass off
In Czech it means "Attention, the police notifies" apparently, but in Russian it means "What a shame, the police steals" :D And the word "pozor" in Russian has pretty dramatic negative meaning, to shame or to blame someone for something
Beards have been growing in popularity and really took off during the pandemic, since men stuck at home could grow through the awkward "too long for a stubble, too short for a beard" phase
Catherine sure liked her lovers
She had entire quality control conveyor belt for them, she only slept with people who were validated in bed by First Dame
She used her numerous ladies-in-waiting to test drive and rate prospective bedmates, with the final test being her closest confidante
English is increasingly spoken as a lingua franca among people who don't share the same native language, like in this international community
I haven't noticed English replacing Russian as a primary language in Russia, and I believe it's the same in other countries with their own languages
Zero reasons to worry
In Russia, it's definitely [Cossacks] that first come to mind
While they usually had a function of border guards, they are also responsible for Russian expansion to the east in Siberia and south in the Caucasus region and to a lesser degree in Central Asia
If we are speaking for my country I want to live in the USSR
Maybe 1980s. That’s the best Soviet years
Some people say that it used to be perfect time and the rest of them say that it wasn’t so good
I want see it by myself
But if I could pick some period not in my country I will pick USA 1930-1940s. That criminal time
To live in New York full of mafia families
I like that stuff
Honestly for most of the history Russia has been kind of a shit place to live
Maybe early 1800s in Saint Petersburg as that was considered the golden era for art
I'll roll the dice on 2150-2200
Why would you prefer to live in Swedish Oblast
And those were no artichokes
14 total, 3 of them are in Moscow
14+. Russia
They are popular here
Not enough
In Russia and everywhere across CIS people call them N word or at least Blacks
That’s how we are taught since kindergarten
There are three big races: White, Yellow and Black
No hatred
That’s quite illogical thing
Why it’s okay to call white people white, and using “black” is offensive
Also even in Moscow africans aren’t so often met as in other European capitals
People often stare at them and even might point at them
Not because they hate them
It’s like seeing a Lamborghini or Bugatti
You just can’t see that everyday here
There can’t be any hatred in here
Firstly there’s just no reason to hate (I don’t think that even a million of africans visited Russia since 9th century till 1917) and secondly our greatest poet Aleksandr Pushkin had an african grandad
> Also even in Moscow africans aren’t so often met as in other European capitals
I see them every day handing out flyers or selling counterfeit perfume
Black people commuting to work or just enjoying life are a much rarer sight, of course
We call then almost the same way чёрный(chorniy), чернокожий(chernokozhiy)
Of course there are more offensive words черномазый(chernomaziy), чернозадый(chernozadiy), черножопый(chernozhopiy) etc
Also negr is more common than nigger here in Russia
Not in Russia
If you go and complain because of being called black you will be asked “Then who are you
White or yellow
Yeah also can be often seen in South-West of Moscow near RUDN
But I don’t see them often near my home
Positive discrimination is a negative thing for me
They say “everybody’s equal”, than have a plan of how many blacks they must hire
Not whites, not yellows
Blacks
Discrimination can’t be positive
We’re less racists as you are
We have almost 200 ethnicities that are native Russians

The periodic table symbols are in Latin script, and Russian uses Cyrillic, so that's already a difference
Many elements which correspond to substances known for a long time have native Russian names which are different, like *vodorod* (H), *uglerod* (C), *kislorod* (O), *azot* (N), *zhelezo* (Fe), *kremnij* (Si), *zoloto* (Au), *serebro* (Ag), *olovo* (Sn), etc
Other elements (especially newer ones) have names similar to their symbols because they are more recent loanwords, like *gelij* (He), *litij* (Li), *kaltsyj* (Ca), *palladij* (Pa), *alyuminij* (Al), *uran* (U), and so on
For real
Pb is *svinets*, Sn is *olovo* in Russian
Seems like we've encountered one of many Slavic false friends
My favorite Czech one is "pozor" (attention) which means "shame" in Russian
It's fun to walk around Prague and see "Shame

Officially it’s called ampersand in Russian, but I’ve never heard it outside of professional field
People usually call it ‘and sign’ («знак энд» or «знак и»)
But it’s used very rarely, usually in some (quasi-)Western logos
It’s not in the language tradition and there is no point to replace a one-symbol conjunction (и) with a different symbol

Because Muscovy princes were the sneakiest of all russian cities
Originally the Moscow became a capital just by conquering (or buying/inheriting) the other principalities of a fractured Late Middle-Ages Russia
Then Peter I moved capital into a newly built St
Petersburg in 1712, but the Bolsheviks moved it back into Moscow in 1918 because at that time the Germans were still advancing on the Eastern Front of WWI, so the Bolsheviks were afraid to remain Petersburg (at that time Petrograd) as the capital since it was closer to the front line, hence more vulnerable than Moscow
No, it was renamed in 1914
Saint Petersburg sounded too German (in Russian it sounds like Sankt Peterburg, which is even more German), so they renamed it to sound more Russian (-grad means "city" in Russian, so basically Petrograd is the same as Petersburg, but Russified)
I guess, it is comparable to the British royal family changing their surname to Windsor for the same reason
Actually, the interim government (or Provisional government, as it is more traditionally called by historians) also planned to move the capital into Moscow because of the frontline
They just didn't manage to be long enough in charge of the country to do that
Graded by the level of obscenity:
"все равно" — "all is equal"
"без разницы" — "no difference"
"мне фиолетово" — "to me it's purple" (sounds pretentious and a bit outdated)
"пофиг" — "by the fig" (?) I don't know how to translate it literally
"похер" — "by the dick" (this is a "bad" word but not so bad
"похуй" — "by the dick" (this is a "bad" word)
"пох" — a shortened version of the above
There should be "мне" ("to me") before the last four imo
Also there's "меня не ебёт" - \[it\] doesn't fuck me
I had no idea it was used elsewhere
Yeah it can be there, but it doesn't have to imo
I don't think I've ever heard it, but it's possible
I've definitely heard "что то говно, что это говно" (means the same thing)
Or "что то хуйня, что это хуйня". Or perhaps some other variation
Your reply reminds me of this legendary meme:

What are some examples of overly-formal or strange phrases that foreigners learning your language seem to always get taught
I've only experience with German and Russian, myself, but it seems to me that English speakers learning both languages get saddled with some overly formal phrases that just aren't used
In Germany's case, this could be a High German thing (I don't know, I only learned it at school) whereas, in Russian, I assume it's just some attitude that teaching people the most formal/complicated way to say something means they'll have an easier time of things in general (they'll understand people in general while still being able to comprehend overly formal nonsense)
But I mean, to give some examples with Russian, here's one daft phrase I was taught back at a Russian school:
Извините пожалуйста, вы не знаете где находиться библиотека?
"Excuse me, please, but you don't know where the library is located, do you
It's perfectly fine but I've never heard a Russian speak like this
Some people have even laughed a little because it's sort of like "British logic" (about manners) applied to a foreign language
Why say "Excuse me, but you wouldn't happen to know where the library is located, would you
" when you can just say "Excuse me please, where is the library
As for English; a lot of Russian kids learn to say stuff like "I seldom go fishing
" Who the hell says "seldom" in regular conversation
Or, when they want to say someone is frugal, they're taught to say "he's a very mean person
" I don't think any English people would take that to mean a person who doesn't like spending money
So, yeah, would be interested to hear what it's like with other languages - German, French, Spanish, Italian
do you have a lot of foreigners using overly formal/dated phrases because their education systems teach some kind of high academic language dating from the 1950s?
Haha
I actually found it really cool that other languages have formal/informal pronouns; I assumed it meant you could easily show where people stand with you and that, when you meet someone new and get to know them, you have some cool "level up" moment when they switch pronouns with you <3
Then I moved to Russia and found that everyone under 40 almost exclusively uses informal means of address outside the most formal of situations
It actually bothers me a little because I'm not too keen on unearned familiarity (back in the UK, I didn't like when people called me "mate," "pal" or "friend;" I'm not your friend
I don't know your name
Stop schmoozing me
Hah, I think Hueber textbooks say that you should address your waiter either as Herr Ober (man) or Fräulein (woman)
I tried a Michel Thomas French course and I believe this was the first full phrase he taught, lol
That phrase is so dead that, when I was in North Korea, our tour guide there tried to use it to demonstrate familiarity with slang
That's because, oddly enough, Oxbridge English books are written by middle aged coddled Oxbridge academics
Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod :)
I've never heard anyone negate the знаете. Perhaps my wife and the company she keeps are just filthy but they'd just say "Вы знаете где...?" Doesn't вы *не* знаете come off as somewhat pretentious
>я изучаю русский язык instead я учу русский.
Fuuuuuuuck
>как ты?
At least this one I get right, lol
For sure is fine, isn't it
Guess it depends on the context
"So are we on for this evening
" "Yeah man, for sure
"He must've known it was you for sure
And then let's not forget glorious Ebonics and "fo' sho'."
Maybe it's a Yankee thing
I'm going to listen out to other Brits, now
I worry that being out the country might have thrown off my perception of BrEnglish
I'm the worst person to ask for Russian advice, but I'd just ask "Вы знаете где библиотека (похалуйста)
To be fair, though, pretty much every English textbook teaches "I have got
I think the logic is that teaching them a sentence that is too complex is preferable to their only learning the simple version and therefore not understanding the more complex one should they happen upon it
I don't deny that "mean" once meant someone who was tight-fisted
E.g. "you mean old miser
But I'd wager that you ask any young'un on the street what comes to mind when the word "mean" is used and they'll say it means unpleasant or not notice
No, negated questions are the polite form in Russian, but my wife embarrassed me in a shop in Winchester once by asking the shopkeeper "Don't you have this in a smaller jar
" I had to teach her that this doesn't sound polite at all
I ain't your mate, pal
It sounds like Agent Provocateur branching out into contraception market
Not hard to visit it, just expensive
A whole bunch of tour companies offer packages and will take care of the visa
You're probably right, but I doubt I'll ever drop it
It's just not within the nature of an Englishman to dispense with a please
I'd be scared that it'd make ruder when I go home
By the way, you're the fellow who ran that blog that wanted to talk to me like a year ago, right
:p Sorry, I never got in touch
I would add **а** to make it **извините, а где библиотека?**, but a negated question is always appropriate
Fuck, you can probably just leave it at "где библиотека?"
There was a Russian poster in this thread saying that people do use the formal variant to be polite
but in my experience (in Siberia at least), people are short and to the point with their requests
Wow, interesting
I mean, I'm 28, and never encountered that meaning until I heard Russians using it, which made me do some digging myself
I've been teaching English here for five years
Just turn up to a city that isn't Moscow or SPB and schools will throw jobs at you
Ша for Russian: Саша, Паша, Наташа, Миша, Лёша...
Sasha, Pasha etc
Same in Russian, but there are some curious things like Aleksey – Liosha (Алексей – Лёша), so it even doesn't have many common letters, or Georgiy - Gosha (Георгий – Гоша)
And as far as I know, in Ukrainian Oleksandr also is Sasha
Perhaps, this "sha" stuff sounds soft and cozy
Maria is also Masha,  and I think it's a real tendency

The problem is if the city is built with cars in mnd already it's a hassle to get anywhere even if you had busses going non-stop through the same roads
European cities might be better in that regard, but try to use public transportation to get to a cinema or to work from some american suburb, especially if you want to do it on repeat
You need good centralization of population for the public transport to be effective, even if we ignore that public transportation can be depressing if it's struggling with volume of people
It's not hard to build without abundance of cars in mind
A lot of distrcitcs in the middle of Moscow are still unable to accomodate cars even when population density is very high
It's just many high rise apartment builngs close together with most of the destinations (groceries, cinemas, schools, clinics - there are dozens of them within very small areas because of that) in pedestrian accessibility, but all of the streets are littlered in cars parked on top of each other
Soviets just didn't expect 500 people in the building to own 250 cars
I could reasonably say that Moscow would probably be ok with only public transport
It just that it takes arguably the best metro system in the world and spam of buses, vans, trams, trolleys etc
I don't think you can repeat it in every city
And it's probably impossible in cities where you don't have all your daily destinations (save for work) in pedestrian access
I’m so jealous

> I hope (a lot) of Europe have a realisation after this that its time we invest more in healthcare and start paying the staff salaries that reflect their skill level
Invest who
This statement of this supposed researcher is ridiculous, Ronaldo and Messi funded by their sponsors and wealthy club owners plus fans that go to stadium for the sake of entertainment and her salary paid from the taxes/government investment including this supposed researcher
The people who seek cure is a general public, which can't give Ronaldo or Messi millions
There no one to blame and whole statement is like a forged click bait filled with ignorance
And how you want to invest and where you want to invest and on which funds you want to invest
You can't have economy that generate money without investing into economy back and you can't have funding for this researches without taking excesses of the economy that you invested into and this excesses will go not only into this researches, but for other programs and then you getting into politics where people start arguing what more important a cure from flu or new schools or homeless program or counter boogeymen from afar and where to cut funds and then among programs which one you prioritize and when you slash the one that stuck instead of making it money sinkhole
"We need more money" was never the answer to fixing any problem nor poverty, nor health, nor education
>No investment in anything has ever worked
That sounds pretty communist to me
Communist approach toward science is exactly what kind of science investment of the government should exists in minds of some people
Like pour all the resources into state running universities and research labs and find the cures
Then you have completely unsustainable research budget and spread of the fields with dead researches that became money sinks

New Year without snow is just sad
Makes me feel very homesick for Siberia
We had like a week of proper snow last year in November
Then it all melted away and never came back
This December is also going to be rainy if the forecast is correct
When I was in Riga last year, the only thing that was missing was snow
The city looked gorgeous with its Christmas decorations, and snow would have made it even more perfect
Overall I hate snow, but on Christmas it’s a must
You can take all of it
There's not much to do in the square itself (when the skating rink is not set up), so most people on the square are tourists and wedding parties

So based on this, Lenin was either tatar or Uzbek
the Tatar, an infamous supervillain, and his henchmen
Seriously speaking, he's from my hometown of Ulyanovsk, then Simbirsk, which is very close to Tatarstan and has always been a melting pot of Russians, Tatars, Chuvash and Mordvin
As a matter of fact, one of the oldest street was called Tatarskaya as there was quite a few Tatars living

We can talk about democracy as much as we want but to be honest and objective, even if we have fair elections : he will never win, but Putin will, unfortunately
That’s why I don’t even understand why they are trying to pressure him
Probation violation I think
They probably are going to go to court and try to replace his probation with real sentence
Of course they have no real case for that, not like he left country by choice for some vacation
Still, from what I expect from Russian justice system, Navalny will probably lose the case, and it may go all the way to **ECHR** before they admit that it is bullshit
Which might take up to couple of years
He violated the terms of the suspended sentence he was under for embezzlement, and was arrested when he returned to the jurisdiction

Russia and Ukraine having the same amount of journalists jailed combined as one small Azerbaijan has surprised me seeing our strict laws and war between countries
Russia: ok, 5 journalists, maybe
The problem is, journalism is already dead here, so it's more correct to count all of the political arrests
There were one metric fuckton of political arrests in Russia in 2019
TUUUUUURRRRKS
Excuse me but what exactly can you confirm
Have you, like, personally seen those 150+ detained journalists
Edit: there are a few people here who thought that I tried to doubt the fact that Turkey is messed up so I'll clarify: uhm, nope, what the fuck
I just wanted to address that a phrase "I confirm" just because you are from the same country doesn't make sence
It's like if I said "I am from Moscow and I confirm, Nemtsov was indeed misteriously assasinated in the center of the city
". That would just be nonsense
Lol

Belarusians aren't afraid of expressing themselves to a random Ukrainian

Their knowledge about life in Belarus is quite likely not much better than about life on Mars
A Ukrainian visiting Belarus would get more out of said visit than you might for example
Simply because he knows the language, he knows the culture and he can read the context and cultural cues that would be lost on an outsider

Lots of people are on here commenting "yikes, no masks, they should really have masks on, stay tuned for the pneumonia spike in two weeks"... You're not wrong
But it's important to remember that Russia already had a year long shit response to COVID so a lot of of these people already had it and now have some sort of immunity
More importantly, and this is not up for debate, there will come a time where the benefits of fighting for your rights will outweigh the illl effects of a widespread virus
I fear that Russia may be approaching that boundary sooner that the western world may want to admit
Navalny is a hero
He was able to unite people against Putin despite the complete information blockade in the russia media
With his courage he gave us hope that Russia would be free
A good chunk of protesters aren't exactly his supporters but just good people who are against state crimes
That's a hard to swallow pill ...
Thank you, it's important for us feel world's support
There are many people in Russia who like polish culture
I really, really, really wish you lived in Russia and tried to change things
People in this country dont get a word at all
Unlikely
Out of all people i know only two support him
Even my grandmother opened her eyes after imvestigations of Navalny, she used to be pro-putin as hell
Ah shit
That's sinister as hell
Okay, I see the central station and the famous St
Tourist cathedral
Where is Skripal's house
Yes, Constitutional Court, provoke **mass protests** during Covid pandemic
We have same jokes about 70 cases in Russia for 70 tests
Are you pneumonia cases or cold cases high
>I have this faint hope that if cases in Russia were actually rising fast and the government was trying to censor it, the information about such cases would still be available in the west because Russia is not isolated or nowhere near the censorship level that exists in China
They have no capacity to censor it like China does, there a plenty of russian talking media that aren't in Russia and there a lot of opposing media that can go with line of party till it matters to them
So they may not critic Putin, but hiding truth about Covid-19 can set them off on the hunt
>Doctors in Russia would rise awareness by releasing information through various available media devices, twitter, reddit, youtube etc
Well, they rather would rise awareness about lack of tests
>Even China had tough time hiding the rapid rise of cases despite the massive censorship
The panic and comments that Russia "is certainly hiding cases and they are in thousands already" are absolutely ridiculous and unfounded in my opinion
So far it seems to me that Russian government aren't trying to hide anything and were rapid in their actions against spreading of disease
It's true that everyone suspicious that cases so low, but i can understand why so
First of all probably a lot of clinics do not have proper tests for detecting Covid-19 and there is a problem with the fact that Covid-19 leads toward pneumonia, so if you getting hospitalized you probably will be diagnosed with pneumonia and all the actions will be focusing on beating bacterial pneumonia, which won't help in this case and in the post-mortem autopsy you body will show pneumonia case and no test will show any microflora after that heavy amount of antibiotics you will get in normal treatment, so i think the cases are mislabeled by lack of knowledge or lack of testing, not vile intent, but at the same time i don't think that we so bad case as Italy, due to our landmass and scarcity of the population
So far they following the suit of the WHO and i heard they have higher access to the Chinese research due to politics, so maybe they cook something up as a medicine, while US trying to buy it from Germany
Edit:
Also forgot to mention that media seems to be required now to decrease tension in their articles, for example they started using "gas clap" instead of "gas explosion" in articles and it seems like there were influx in the cold/pneumonia articles cases in the past months, so either they became cautious and reporting everything or they using this "soft" language
Hard to guess

The "Russian military support" to Lukashenko that people in this thread are talking about is related only to CSTO and, as Alex forgot to mention, an external military threat
So in that sense, he's on his own
Russian government officials seem to be kind of quiet
I wonder if they're hoping for an Armenian solution, i.e. the dictator is out, but Belarus maintains a pro-Russian stance
It would make the most sense as well
Russian media, however, throws this upside down
I'm kinda confused at this point
RT, uuh TV stuff, bots in the state media comment sections - all talk about "Western methods", Nazis (because apparently Nazi collaborators used the white-red-white flag
Well might as well ban our tricolor, because the ROA used it), all the worst adjectives and names you could possibly think a Russian chauvinist would say
Also, there was a little pro-Lukashenko rally in Moscow, or so I saw on social media, with people holding signs basically calling for Belarusian OMON to murder everyone there
Zhirinovsky said something about how Russia shouldn't allow NATO tanks near Smolensk - but hopefully nobody actually cares about him these days
Fun times
Hope we will get the same in Russia soon

Doesn't look like they cared much for training

You have a very well defined group who thinks you deserve death for speaking against them
If this is not a culture or values issue then what
They will keep killing and you will keep cleaning up aftermath instead of preventing
Yep, I've read it
>economic factors
I have no statistics for Europe (show it to me of you have), but looking at USA stats, most wealthy sample of one cultural group can commit more crimes than most poor sample of the other
While economic factor is unarguably there, you didn't presented any argument against cultural part
>poorly integrated
What falls under "integration"? I'm afraid you yourself will end up with culture and values while trying to define it
Is speaking a language of country you're in is culture, for instance
Doesn't seems like an economic factor to me at least
Well, it took them only what, 50 years, to admit to the Katyn massacre
I hope it will happen sooner this time
Best case scenario, I guess, would be like Russia paying compensation for the relatives and giving the condolences for "terrible loss of life".
Highly doubt that anyone would be prosecuted, if they were really Russian service members
Also there are a lot of real bots on YouTube
Bots usually operating on the web-resources popular in Russia
But reddit is not one of them
So I doubt if there are any bots
But there can be real people who support Putin
I think as an independent journalist or an opposition politician you have a much higher chance of not getting any work and starving to death, rather than being murdered
Don't get me wrong - the oppression is real, but in most cases it's a lot more subtle than what you see in the comical portrayal by the media
The overwhelming amount of damage is done trough economic pressure and exhausting harassment, not the blunt force
How's that temple of NOD doing

60 thousand people is surely below the announced 100 thousand, but it's finally still something
Still not enough
> an enormous succes
By what measure
None of the demands have been met so far
To get to participate in Duma elections you have to gather a certain number of signatures from your supporters
A lot of independent candidates who did this for the upcoming Moscow election got denied their registration as a candidate because number of fake signatures and errors in filling in the forms for such signature gathering is above allowed threshold
That's the official position
But of course the signatures aren't actually fake and the errors are very minor/the rules aren't actually written anywhere about these kind of mistakes
The candidates go to court and lose without having their arguments considered at all
Another thing fueling this is how many people got detained and treated violently during the last protests that were not approved by the local government
People believe the law that requires such approvals goes against the constitution
See [my comment here]
I don't think there is any correlation between political system and imperialism
The US and the UK are pretty democratic, but still invade, meddle in other countries and what not
I can't see how that hypothetical democratic Russia would be any less imperialistic
~~Third actually
First was on July 27th, second on August 3rd and this is the third one~~
Ok, I forgot about several protests in July
Yeah, that's a degree of desperation
The mere fact of people going to the streets is seen as a tremendous success
> People believe the law that requires such approvals goes against the constitution
The problem is that it doesn’t. The constitution says “citizens of Russia can protest peacefully and unarmed” but it also admits that constitutional rights of people can be affected by the federal law
And the federal law prohibits “illegal” protests
Yeah
It’s not that the Kremlin doesn’t care about the Russian constitution
It’s that the constitution itself is fucked
I'm not going to debate this kind of uninspired demagoguery on my phone
You know the right answer to your loaded question yourself
A lot of people whose signatures were rejected were glad to  eyewitness in court and present video of them making the signature too, judges were not interested
Opposition candidates started taking extra evidence like these videos since a few years ago unwanted candidates were sabotaged by infiltrated agents who deliberately spoiled signatures
We had once
At least the West approved Yeltsin's era as such
Totally sucked and costed trillions of GDP and millions of lives
It’s not even being overridden, technically
The federal law is more of a clarification
Constitution: You can protest and shit
Also constitution: the federal law is legit
Federal law: yeah you can protest, you just need to get a permit for that so that we make sure that your protest doesn’t disturb anyone

I have always thought the Moscow Metro left it unfinished and brought it as a design idea
I'll be there in about an hour
I go that area frequently, but I've never been to the metro station
Looks rad
There's a really wild shopping mall next to it that has all kinds of electronic equipment and retro gaming shops
I'm going there to buy a PS2 (fat version), my old one is back in the States and I miss playing Socom
But yeah, I'll run down and check out the station today
I'm so sick of this picture
I prefer by far the classic style of the old subway stations this futuristic shit seems to have no soul
It's 409 km long already
And would increase a bit in a few days with 1 new station opening
Не баг, а фича!
Lmao, I hate that mall
It's always impossible to find the particular shop that you need
It's even more of a nightmare if your phone is broken and you're going there to get a new one that you have already pre-ordered
Hope you don't get lost
Is that near the skyscrapers
This particular station was built with the plan in mind that it would be a closing-doors style stations, meaning you wouldn't see the outside wall as it would be covered by the train
[It looks roughly like this
] But the plans changed mid-construction so it had to be built this way
> Russian train stations
Rather train stations in Moscow and St Petersburg, and not even all of those
Tbh, this is the first time i've seen this
Putin himself sits in a tiny room at the end of the station and watches everyone to get poisoned
Moscow metro is famous for its tidiness
I don't really know how they do it
Was the mayor planning on more American tourists coming to visit
I really wonder what you imagine there happening
Well, I don’t think that gay people look any different than heterosexual people so you’ll be fine as long as you don’t make out with a dude in public or have an LGBT flag with you
Yes, that’s pretty fucked but you’ll be fine as long as nobody knows you’re gay :/
And if you see a group of chechens or gopnic-esque looking Russians, you should stay away from them no matter if you’re gay or not
You're overestimating your importance to random strangers on the street, especially when it comes to Moscow
Well, I'd say that Russia is somewhat 5-7 years from saying "fuck it" and letting it go, of course, if a Pride event will get a permisson to happen
It' still too easy to stigmatize public gatherings without official permissions, especially for older generations
Shit's depressing, man

[me for the last few days] reading news and polls and seeing how situation in this country keeps getting worse
and looking at the comments, it feels like our reputation has been tarnished for the next century at least
Those Russian talk shows on state tv channels are such dumpsters jeez
Actually every channel here is kinda "state" because they are heavily censored
So, our cucked-in-the-past former communist block members, Georgia that was not allowed to put genocide on Ossetians and always conspiring, always warmongering Angloes
Nothing special of a list
Pfft, I don't think anyone in this world likes us
That's a fucking shame
Hypocrites, russophobes and degenerates - how to describe all of rusgov, rus

I hope they all will burn in 7th circle of Hell

Does this mean I can't be friends with people from these countries anymore
I really hope people on this thread don't confuse the Russian government with the Russian people
It really breaks my heart that the situation is what it is :(
Congratulations
Because it’s «Россия 1». Fuck them and other state owned propaganda machines to damnation
A bunch of fucking hypocrites and liars - some of their employees happily own property in the UK, the USA and other Western countries and their children go to local schools/universities

Sorry, you are not trying hard enough

I think Erdogan in the club of dictatorship so they used to  help each other despite them deferences
Actually poor
We are ask for this
And nobody else
Is not funny, is fucking cringe
I hope this russophobic bastards in rusgov will be suffer
It kind of makes sense from Russian POV because according to Russian officials we never do anything wrong ever and all of those accusations are fake news to demonize blah blah blah blah, you get the point
And sadly millions believe it too
Russia was never been out this cycle, and never will
Like, a normal one lol
Russia I used to read about in our own Consituition (the previous one) would do honestly
Even until 2014 things looked tense but kinda promising, civil institutions were somehow developing along with people's political awareness, there were hopes for real opposition gaining more weight etc
There were even public LGBT festivals, there were sex ed classes in my high school, it still wasn't ideal but it looked like it was all going to get better
And then a complete blackout, everyone is suddenly an enemy and the shithousery has begun
Sergei Brilev, there was a somewhat big scandal when his UK citizenship was revealed
But no consequences for him of course
I know, most people here say this all the time no matter what shit our government does, and it makes me glad
Yeah the situation in both our countries seems quite similar
Erdogan and Putin are almost identical autocrats, I guess that’s why they’re such bros (at least, in public)
Let them both go to some remote island and enjoy the company of each other, while our nations build some proper democracy to live in peace and prosperity
We deserve it, man
You guys have so much russians and ukrainians as immigrants, you want more
Sorry for a late reply
Not sure I can add much more than some other commenters already did

He was poisoned by his enemies
The thing is that if they wanted to kill him - they would do it
I would take it more as an alert for Navalny to stay calm and not trying to create the same thing Belarus is passing through
aw shit, here we go again
He was once very suspiciously and suddenly "sick" while being in detention
Before that he was attacked and splashed with an unknown chemical on a street which forced him to go to Europe for cornea transplant because he almost lost sight in his eye
Not a matter of if, but when
Hopefully this year
Rise up against what
About 70% of our population either actually support Putin or genuinely thinks that he’s the lesser evil
As a Russian I tell you Navalny would not
He does great investigations on corruption in Russian government, but as a politician he's quite incompetent and self-absorbed to a fault
He's neither the "star", or an opposition leader - in fact, he refuses to cooperate with coordinated opposition efforts more often than not
He's been rising for what, 10 years already
It's true there's no one else who can match his popularity, but it is still in single digits
But be warned: you have to drink it right, or it’s poisonous
He is an alt right

Proposals are trying to hit the most problematic areas
Strip mass surveillance or social credit scores of any AI technology and what is actually left
Cameras which record all data without any ability to pinpoint particular individual or event in easy and timely fashion
Like in many shops the records are fully watched only if anything extraordinary happens like a crime or even terrorist attack
Social credit scores which basically rely on some explicit rules which can be easily discussed and rejected by society
For example, if someone is a known sexual offender, society can consider him unfit for being a teacher
Now the discussion of such models is problematic because deep learning models are black box models and interpretation of how it gets specific answer is still the area of research
I think these proposals are actually good
Especially notifying part because people have to wake up and understand just how much AI tech influence our everyday lives
But the language is still vague and the industry would not like it a one bit
Actually article mentions the vagueness of the term
That is only leaked draft, so hope wording will improve before it would be revealed before public
But I think they should opt out of these technical and academic discussions and just stick to particular application
For example, you can freely use any algorithm for cancer cell detection but you can't just detect and identify faces on mass surveillance videos
Does not matter how you do it, keep all technical side to actual experts instead of politicians and the government
I don't know about others but in my case it is not about digital illiteracy
Fellow computer vision engineer here
I know how deeply machine learning infiltrated our lives
Yes it does compares to "let's ban the internet". Yes, you can say that there are some parts of site people click agree without reading
But basically there is a big social interest to make it less about private, murky conditions of service and more of the public regulations
Yes, it will hit industry on so many levels and people would have to deal with many businesses in the field losing profits and quality of service degrading
But in my opinion that actually worth it and people are just too comfy to properly to understand that data privacy actually means
At least we need part of notifying the people that some decisions are fully automatic with little human moderation
That would really help to raise digital literacy
I wish these MPs and the likeminded Poles all the best

Medvedev, in fact, wasn't just a puppet, his internal policy was different to Putin's. He openly supported including the main opposition channel into the pool of free 20 digital channels

I mean that credible ability to vote an unwanted politician out doesn't worth much on its own
Participant political culture implies not only that citizens are capable of changing country's leadership by legal means, but also that those citizens do understand important features that differ one talking figure head in the TV from another one
To put it simply: citizens understand the negatives and positives of the old style and therefore make path for certain changes
That picture presumes that Ukrainian political culture is better than that in Russia and Belorussia, only because none of Ukraine's president has ever been re-elected and has always been put out of the office under an avalanche of slander, booing and with a *Lame crook* ticket stamped to his back and a hefty bank account in some off-shore
I think that only proves that Ukrainian political landscape is swarmed by self-serving crooks who mainly care about making business
Whatever talking head occupies the TV atm is irrelevant to them and common folk rarely realizes difference between one and another aside simplistic propaganda cliche like *He is an oligarch X's puppet
She is a Z's lobbyist
He is going to sell Ukraine to Y*.

I kinda feel that comparing people to Hitler diminish all the crimes that Hitler allowed to be committed in Nazi Germany
Sure, don't like Stalin, but no conveyor death factories based on flawed theory of superiority
Sure, don't like  Putin, but comparing him to Hitler or Stalin

You're right, blood

History repeats itself and nobody's learning
I agree with you
Because EU and world in general have no balls to stop our government, everyone is suffering
Russia, Ukraine, Georgia etc
And it will get worse for Ukraine and Russia until there's no money left in Russia
Thank you very much for making all people in Russia = Putin supporters
Also we eat babies for breakfast
Why should I? I'm a Russian citizen, proud of my country
I'm just not dumb enough to think Russia = current corrupt government
You have a point but people are suffering in both Ukraine and Russia
(((
It's not so easy in Russia
You can't just vote against current government
You can't protest
You have no power against the government, they easily can throw you to jail or asylum

Honestly, I don't understood all what nuclear fear-mongering happened in 2000s. Including waste utilisation issues and potential (but low) chance of nuclear incident it is still better then coal in almost every aspect
Yeah sure, we all are the same here
Dictatorship ! Hooraaaaaay
Well
I get where you stand so I'll try my best
Those stereotypes you mentioned about Finns and Brits indeed do exist
Perhaps not without a reason
I would believe most Finns do indeed like sauna
The thing is - I don't believe most Russians want dictatorship to have a free reign everywhere and/or have some kind of malicious intent towards everyone(as implied by your words)
I believe that historically, for many reasons, it was harder for common people in Russia to fight for their rights vs elites than, say, in western Europe
I could discuss many reasons for this, but I'll leave it for another topic
Basically what I mean is that it takes more effort here to change something for the better
Elites here have (and always had) more power to ignore people's will
Stagnation leads to radicalization
So moderate and weighted decisions are becoming less popular and radicals and populists come to the fore
And among those people - there are many more people acting with a bad faith
So basically it takes some radical effort to change something, and when a change finally occur - it often turns into a chaos
In times of chaos when standards of living are drastically reduced and even some basic needs are not satisfied anymore  - leaders that offer stability (=basic needs satisfaction) at the expense of freedom and extra needs - gain popularity
People are willing to give them more power that they will eventually abuse
ignoring people's will all over again
&#x200B;
And it's very hard to escape this self-replicating system
&#x200B;
Sorry for a wall of text, but I'm just very sad when people imply that we're some kind of barbaric evil people, when in reality, based on my experience - there are so many different kind of people - bad and good, including many kind, open minded and loving people
I think it's just like as everywhere really
Is "La vita è bella" a movie people show their kids (as in (late)teenage children) in Italy
I'm showing it to all my friends when possible, it's just so good
And then to have 15% answer like that to this question

Perfect demonstration of how dumb we've became
That explains a lot of what's going on
>bends history making Americans the liberators instead of the Soviets
Couldn't care less to be honest, Soviets were not angels and so were not the Yanks
And it's quite tough to call something "liberation" when afterwards you're put behind the Iron Curtain

Not gonna lie, I find that ugly
But if people living there are happy with this development, nothing but best wishes for them
No, absolutly
It was little bit surprising for me
Most people in Georgia don't like russian goverment, but very friendly with russian tourists
Yet can
Trump talks about sanctions on germany for NS2, unleashing ISIS fighter in europe, fucks up market via tweets, block other from doing business in Iran, support climate  change policies
You hate russian and want others to be like you, but they arent and that makes you confused
Actually he did
The problem is that no matter how a referendum had been initiated, the West wouldn't have recognized its results, as it would be against American interests - they would definitely state that any Crimean referendum was illegal according to the Ukrainian constitution
Stating that a region was illegally occupied and then putting sanctions on the region, banning all international flights and making every possible way to visit or leave the region as hard as possible, is against that common sense, isn't it
It's like putting sanctions on Jews for Holocaust
If the region was truly oppressed and occupied against Crimeans' will, the US would jump out of their pants to open the borders, as it happened in the DDR
I'm talking about Crimea
Crimeans are obliged to get visas only in Ukraine, even though there is a constant risk for them to get persecuted both by Ukrainian authorities and nationalists for "separatism".
Again, if the West really cared about Crimeans, they would send official delegations there, examining the real situation, possibly discussing a second (or fifth) referendum under international observation
But they don't really care
There are some stories about Crimeans getting political asylum in Europe or US, but most of them are sporadic and tied to political activism
The fact of just living in Crimea is not enough - there should be any evidence of personal persecution - political, religious, based on sexual orientation, etc
So it's just basic rules as for asylum seekers from any region without an active military conflict
I dunno dude this European censore kinda sucks
Happy independence day, Ukraine
Слава братьям!

Happy Independence Day
Did you just call my country USSR
We *fucking* wish it was that way
USSR is not that insulting
A solid portion of people actually miss it
There are many Russians who dislike commies
So they won’t be happy for sure
I don’t think there are people that want USSR back - maybe some elderly people, but that’s pretty much it
What many Russians do miss is Russia with the size, economy and power of USSR
So, for many it’ll be great to have capitalist Eurasian Federation without commies but roughly in borders of former Soviet republics
Many would even go so far to say that ditching Central Asian republics is clever choice and they only want Ru/UA/By/KZ to be together
This is a common misconception that's being pushed by russian state propaganda
There are already rockets in Poland and Romania, it doesn't mean that NATO is going to attack Russia
I Wish this happened in Russia
There’s also shit going down in Belarus
And there are also major protests in Khabarovsk because the local government was arrested for defeating the wrong party
And massive protests might spark here in Moscow too because the constitution amendment referendum was absolute bullshit
Man, what a year

Dude this is nothing
Seriously, what you see in the video is really nothing by Belarus standards
This summer, there were tons of videos of riot police officers throwing people on the ground and beating them with nightsticks
And not beating as if dealing a couple  blows so the person stops resisting, but beating for the sake of beating
NATO's kinda nice and all, and I consider myself a pro-Western, pro-NATO guy, but man, the level of anti-Russian toxicity in the comment section is wild, as if we're the ultimate bad guys and second coming of Adolf Hitler
So much for freedom loving
But it's Reddit, so it's not really surprising to see commenters with binary views on the world
Imagine creating a military organization versus Russia
Kind of weird

While banning r/europe would only encourage "censorship everywhere in Russia" myth, I'd highly suggest our people not to visit this place, as it's full of hate of russians

Swiss neutrality worked before because they were armed to the teeth (still are, I guess, even if underfunded) and tripwired their country
Being neutral without military investments and proper strategy, just hoping things would be okay, that's the Belgian route
Sadly this is not how Russia is going to function in next 20 years at least, judging by at least modern history of USSR and Russia
I mean, I would not recognise the country, if Russians would actually turn their whole attention to domestic problems and fiercely protest their government over it
Yes but we are in 2021
Did you really expect that Russia would allow USA to put their military bases in Crimea, 1000 km from Moscow and Russians do nothing about it
It was a provocation

You are much more likely to get called real Russian for hating Moscow, fellow
Same story with Belgium and Brussels, I've heard
> Honestly, I hate Moscow
Call me a fake Russian
Duh, I guess most of the Russians outside Moscow hate Moscow (at least those that do are always happy to share their sentiment)
I believe even a sizeable proportion of Muscovites hate Moscow
So, people can call you a fake Russian all they like, but definitely not for hating Moscow
That's because our airports are very far away from center

There are poor people in Moscow, but there are no slums, and even the number of bums decreased significantly over the last 10 years - you can maybe see 1 or 2 near some metro stations in a week

Not everyone is as fortunate with smart leaders, but get a lot of communist and feminist leaders instead
I think that it's linked more to TV becoming obsolete pretty fast, so only people who dislike innovations use it as a main source of news
Those people are in general more conservative, and as such the ultraconservative stance "we're really good, everyone else is out there to get us" is so prevalent on TV, because that's what conservatism looks like in Eastern Europe and the Middle East
I've seen some report about Russian TV popularity, which showed that the percentage of population who use TV as a first news source fell from 45% in 2012 to about 17% in 2017
I don't have a source for that report, and it might not be very accurate, so don't quote me on that, but here TV is mostly used by older people (over 50), while younger generations mainly use Internet (including Social Networks) as news source
At least, that's my theory
Yeah, my thought excatly
I meant that it's more subtle in Russia – they don't put the whole picture in the headline, they often use comparisons and associations to make a point, and only then they start to call names and stuff
Edit: note, that not everyone does that
I think Zvezda is the one that goes head on with everything, for example
I meet from time to time opinions like: "Russians are stupid because why they suffer their stupid powers
" etc etc with the final remembrance of de Custine and the conclusion that Russians are immanently the race of slaves
Like revolutions are such simply done, just take each other hands and in one chain go against everyone bad
You must
For Greater Poland
Are they still doing that
I heard that "Культура" ceased Euronews broadcasting
Well, you seeing it too pessimistically
All techs are sharped from both edges

Why
Do Belarus protests start losing its point
Poland national tv sings to the tune of Duda like if they were in North korea - 28 score
Cyprus has journalists get kill and burn in own car - 20 score
How the fuck do you pack france italy spain Slovenia  between those to
This ranking is retarded
Somehow I expected better from Czechia
They haven’t seen Russia yet
Yes you are correct
Oh , getting killed and burn in a car for revealing panama paper is "perception" and "gut feeling" now
And i though this ranking would be the most stupid thing i'll see all day, but its not even 12 and you already topped it
What a day
No coke before 11 am
Did your mother not warn you
Sure buddy
North korean news paper are also free to publish what they want too
That has nothing to do with intelligence or stupidity to have mix this up
ButYeah other called that mistake out already, you are kind of slow
Nice change of subject by the way
So it is still a gut feeling
Or you want to admit you were wrong
The singular instance i have pointed have/should have massive impact on the ranking
You dont get a journalist murdered every day do you
You dont have a national tv rigging presidential election every day, do you
Meanwhile, You have people in finland dying everyday, just like you have people going in and out of NK without dying everyday as well
So yeah i saw you were using sarcasm, but your post was so stupid that i felt it wasnt worth taking it out of the depth of misery it was in
Are you happy now
Wtf does it matter
You still have a national TV paid by tax payer money that is basically a propaganda machine
It is ok because it is not the only source of information
Big deal
That doesnt excuse anything
Also, im not russian and watching the state of polish democracy and press is pretty disgusting
You are not worth any more time
So you consider it ok that your tax serve as a propaganda lying tool
No wonder the country is fucked up
Most countries have one, but they do not glorify their leader like Poland does
Well well well
That attempt to roast is hilarious
The thing different with what you previously mention is that failing to have a proper press impact your democracy, when an over spending can be be stopped by voting
A failing press is the first step to dictatorship
Are you at this level of illiteracy
What part of "im not russian" did your fried brain missed
Lmao that makes you look like a moron now with all your garbage posted
You have alternative but you do not have proper press as a whole
This is dangerous because some
will believe their bullshit
This is basically a fake news official channel
Thats where dictatorship starts
Ok ok
If you always had it you mean just be used to
But you shouldnt
You should aim at stopping that because this is very dangerous
Fake news is very dangerous for democracy
There is a difference between a tabloid and a straight up lying press
Most democracies dont have lying tabloid simply because they would be prosecuted over it
The exception are UK and USA, not exactly good examples of democracies
Where can Lithuania go that the other Baltics can’t?
Lots of South and Central America as far as I know
Some islands like Philippines, Jamaica and Seychelles
Weirdly, South Korea and Israel and not for a short period of time
Some stamp on arrival like Nepal and technically China
If online visas count then also Mexico, Singapore, Cyprus, India United Emirates and some others
Those are the ones I'm interested in, anyway
I guess that this table doesn't consider covid restrictions, anyway
I doubt that this particular stat takes covid in consideration, really
Its not like entering or not entering under them is a matter of having a visa
Look at UK it can't be 130 currently in any way, they are like in a total lockdown

Welcome to the Internet, abandon all hope of a nuanced and educated discussion at the door please, that k you
Oh, and here's the Kool-Aid
(FWIW I've been able to have decent discussions, it's just that the majority of comments probably aren't worth engaging with
As far as i know they were sorted between Nazi Collaborationists and others then Nazi supporters got shot or prison time, while others were recruited to the Red Army effort
Obviously people who got uninvolved either during war or past war also got shot or prison time

Funnily enough the waiter and the guy I bummed a cigarette at this bar called the bar that doesn’t exist in Brno from we’re brothers from Slovakia
They said that the Slovaks almost outnumber the Czechs
It's funny that a lot of people yesterday called the photo with dead Babchenko fake
I didn't take them seriously, but turns out it was a rare case when conspiracy theorists were right
Now that's a goddamn twist that I like
Nice
Now what
Skripal is alive too
I need more nonsensical news
Even a shovel shoots once a year
There are no magic or "supernatural" — only cutting-edge technology
I don't remember where I read this
But [for example] "A: Why I have feeling that it's photoshop
B: Unrealistic blood color".
People also noticed that Babchenko's last post in Facebook (he wrote that it was his second birthday, that exactly 4 years ago he didn't get a seat in a helicopter that was shot down) looked like a setup for faked death -- and it was true in the end
I have no idea how is it related to the things I've said
Babchenko himself said that he learned about the "assassination" from SBU 1 month ago, so he wrote that dramatic last post already knowing he would be fake "killed" that day
It seems you have some unhealthy obsession about Russians
And sure, the SBU story can be entirely made up
Certainly it would not be the first time SBU lies
While I have no reason to trust SBU, the story can be real as well, I have no opinion on that

We’ve been having a similar meme template for quite a few years
The meme is basically a couple of pictures with text under them which says: “Неповторимый оригинал:” (The inimitable original:) / “Жалкая пародия” (a pathetic parody: )
In this case, it would say “the inimitable original” under the Russian guy and “a pathetic parody” under the American guy
I assure you that our authoritarian government is very developed

CRAWLING IN MY SKIN THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
In Russia we don’t have this tradition but we have Вербное Воскресенье (Palm Sunday)
It is celebrated the Sunday before Easter (this year in orthodox Christianity Easter is celebrated on the 19th of April so Palm Sunday was yesterday)
So the night before Palm Sunday people in villages would go around the village, knock on doors and lightly beat people inside the houses with pussy-willow branches while singing songs
The willow branches were blessed with holly water so this playful beating was supposed to give people health

" Belarus police captain resigns in solidarity with the protestors
Let's hope that a there will be no full blown civil war
Yeah, OMON is really shitty in both of our countries but it's still nice seeing officers from law enforcement side with the people
If this becomes widespread, OMON will be left alone and scared
I’ve seen some Belarusian riot police wet (edit: vet lmao) saying that OMON is literally the worst to encounter when you are protesting because they have the least restrictions
Less than the army, less than the regular police
So they are the most brutal
Belarus police
It was called this way in Russia as well until 2010 when it was renamed into poilce
Legacy of the USSR
Police
They had presidential elections a few days ago
Lukashenko (the dude ruling there for over 20 years) again decided to arrange his own pseudo-democratic victory and started with arresting all the candidates from the opposition
This time people were not having it
They protested for months despite pressure from the police, arrests etc
Still, the only major opposition candidate they actually registered was Tikhanovskaya, the wife of one of the arrested major candidates who decided to register as a candidate mostly of despair and the administration registered her thinking nobody would vote for her
Election day
All the shady stuff you can imagine, observers being removed, fake ballots delivered etc
People staying in line to vote
Approximate results where it was possible to count votes indepentently: about 70% for Tikhanovskaya
Official results: 80% Lukashenko, 10% Tikhanovskaya
They aren't even trying to look legit
After that shit hit the fan
People go protesting, thousands of protestors arrested, clashes with the police reported, Internet mostly shut down for the entire country, workers go on strikes across the country, Tikhanovskaya was forced to record the "please don't go on the streets" speech and leave the country
The quote in the title is from his own post where he posted the iimage
I'm pretty sure it means resignation
Below in the comments
He posted this on his Instagram (@jeghor, Reddit doesn't allow me to link the post directly)
I saw this reposted in the protestors news channel in Telegram
Less accountable when it comes down to specifically riot control
Don’t know if that makes it less scary, but IMO that’s important
Well, the army has lethal weapons
The riot police have rubber bullets, tear gas, flashbangs, water cannons, riot shields and batons, all technically less-than-lethal weapons
If you see 4 of them, they're on patrol
I live next to a metro station close to a few stadiums, so I see them on game days
They are normal in normal encounters (well, as normal as people who have chosen or are only fit for a job like this are)
I would be more wary of regular coppers on patrol than them
Even riot police
“Everyone I don’t like is literally Hitler”
“All the police are literally nazis”
[Reminds me of this me-me]
People of Belarus deserve my support and the author of this garbage photoshop deserves my contempt
Am I the only person who prefers Belarus' current flag
I find it way more unique
Beautiful
People of Belarus deserve new elections without one seasoned candidate participating
Poor guys they have a couple days to retirement
Except that the law enforcement officers in the picture might literally be agreeing with the protestors and might be just doing their job guarding some government building or whatever without raping and torturing anyone
I mean you're right
I'm just saying design wise its much more unique
Look at the flag Lukashenko proposed in 1995, it looks like it belongs to a banana republic
real war heroes on the right are young, and on the left are veterans

Truth is poking in the eyes, eh
People in China think it’s a part of China
Nothing strange in this regard
The odd part is that CCP tries to push that narrative abroad, which can raise many eyebrows
> try to push it
Not only try
I lived in China for a few years and there was no one who claimed Khan to be other than Chinese
Many people even said that at the time , China was the biggest ever, from Korea to Turkey
And don’t get me start with magic war between China and Japan that happened between 1945-1949, apparently
I saw only 1 person who said that it was a Civil war (the kid had a father living in Sweden, mind you) and not a war between Maoist China and Japanese who (apparently) “didn’t know that WWII ended”.
As I said, there was literally one person who said it was a Civil war between KMT and Commies
99,9% of people I talked to told it was a war against Japan, China won and established PRC
China has no territorial disputes with Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan
Territorial disputes are those that are officially claimed by the government
Opinions of private citizens don't matter here
From memory, there were blog posts hosted on Chinese websites about their claims for Tajikistan and such
But if I write a blog post on livejournal how "Alaska is rightful Russian clay, gib back", or if hundreds/thousands of other Russians write similar posts, it doesn't mean Russia has a territorial dispute with US over Alaska
>And apparently, a journalist and a diplomat (Zhang Heqing) (political position, right
) were the ones claiming Vladivodtok
No, a Chinese diplomat in Pakistan tweeting about Vladivostok does not count as an official claim of the Chinese government
Those claims, aka the real territorial disputes, are well known
>No, but if a diplomat like, idk, Mikhail Galuzin made the claim that, it would spark some controversy and sour relations with USA
Aren't diplomats part of the Government
He's our ambassador to Japan apparently, I had to look him up
Depends, if he'll give an interview proclaiming Alaska is rightfully Russian (present tense), I'll imagine it will be eagerly picked up by the media
If some dude working at the embassy in Tokyo or wherever comments how "Alaska used to be Russian" (past tense), no I imagine it will do absolutely nothing to our relationship with the US
Cause that's what happened here more or less
"Zhang Heqing, a Chinese diplomat working in the embassy in Pakistan, commented “isn’t this what in the past was our Haishenwai
”, referring to the Chinese name for the area before its annexation"
>And if Japan was still controling South Korea and forcefully assimilating it on the basis of "common ancestry", how look would you think it'll take until it annexed North Korea
Inner Mongolia is internationally recognised as a part of China
It's a done deal, no matter if people find it "fair" or not
China actively working to assimilate ethnic minorities within its officially recognised territory might not be a great thing to do morally, but it says nothing about their plans to annex other countries beyond the borders they already claim
So no, in this case, assimilating Inner Mongolians does not mean the next step is invading actual independent Mongolia

And I still can't convince my grandma that this, and the invasion of Hungary, were bad
She still brings up ridiculousness about how poor Soviet soldiers were lynched by the revolutionaries, and about CIA tactics of sniper provocateurs shooting at both sides ("just like in Ukraine
"), and something about a small bunch of East Germans dealing with Czechs really simple
wherever the Germans came from
And, of course, "We built the metro and everything for them, and they dare to rename the stations
" and some other arguments I forgot, but it's just weird
And all of that coming from a person who says she doesn't actually want the USSR to come back and now things are better

At least we had enough common sense not to let East Germans to participate - they were very eager
Hmm, didn't  regular Osties wanted revenge for the Sudetenland expulsion
> It wasn't a revolution, it was a coup
Like literally all revolutions ever
What is typically caled a revolution is a chain of coups where creators of the initial one don't survive to see the end
February events in Saint-Petersburg were a military coup obviously
Sabotaging city supplies > activating revolutionary cells on the fleet for the officer massacre > physically arresting the emperor and getting renunciation (or falsifying it)
Now I know the history of French revolution worser but same technologies can be easily seen there as well as general treatment of "revolting mass" as cattle being manipulated
To the point where it's considered the start of "anger of masses" is storming of the Bastille

Sorry but what does bird country mean lol
I mean, I could’ve guessed it based on context
I’m wondering why is that
I just don’t know what the reference is based on
Like, kebab makes sense, because kebab = turk stuff
But why bird
WHY THE FUCK DOES BIRD COUNTRY MEAN TURKEY
I understand that it’s a joke
I don’t understand the reference itself
Edit: yeah I feel pretty dumb now
So bird country is a name for turkey because it’s a wordplay from Turkish language or what
How the fuck is bird country a wordplay for turkey
Yeah I’ve been told by the other guy already
I feel fucking stupid now lol
Hopefully we will join it and kick the ass of these turks

По подробней можно?
Нужно понимать, что правительство любит использовать троллей не только и не столько за рубежом, сколько в местах интернет обитания россиян.
Можно зайти на любой популярный ресурс, даже на русские сабреддиты и заметить похожие по смыслу сообщения;
Навальный - агент запада.
Никто его не поддерживает кроме радикалов.
Протесты ни к чему не приведут.
На улицу выходят дети, которых обманывает оппозиция и провокаторы.

Personal sanctions against all of the senior government officials and Putin's cronies
Not some generals who never leave Russia anyway and don't have any assets abroad, but ministers and billionaires
Some of these are already sanctioned, but there is a long list of people who could join them
Economic sanctions against government controlled companies may be effective too, even military industry in Russia uses a lot of foreign tech and can't really function well without being able to buy it
[был бы человек, а статья найдется]
Many people don't like him to begin with, and they're just delighted to see anything bad happen to him - maybe a bit like some left-wing people in the US might enjoy watching "nazis being punched in the face", or how some right-wing people in the US might enjoy watching "libtards getting owned", but multiplied by 10
I think many Russians don't exactly love nuance when it comes to this kind of stuff and prefer a radical and emotionally charged approach
Which is also evidenced by the fact that any discussion (especially political) on the Russian-speaking internet is basically way more crazy, anger-filled, polarised and aggressive than an identical discussion on the English-speaking internet (which is one of the main reasons why I spend my time on the English-speaking internet, frankly)
Certain Russian people just tend to be super opinionated, forward, harsh and not very compassionate when it comes to people they dislike or disagree with
That's just how I see it, anyway
Ugh, have you been stuck in 2010 with this shit
He never was a member of an ultra-right organization and last time he even publicly cooperated with Russian nationalists was before 2013
It's a screenshot from the latest Sunday protest
It a famous quote that says something like "as long as there's a person, it's not a problem to find a reason to convict them" (but in a much more consice and clever way), effectively foreshadowing this court process
If you know that he ever attended Russian marches, you should know that he publicly stated that he wouldn't attend the one in 2013 and never did so since
Stop shilling
Isn't it more to describe that everybody is sinful, rather than the prosecution can prosecute anyone if they need to
Doesn’t mean that his radical nationalistic views changed
Just imagining us joining makes me smile
Probably wouldn't happen in my lifetime tho
Such a shame that our government tries to indirectly (through media) whitewash this (and the Hungarian) invasion
"They were pro-NATO fascists, something-something everyone was actually happy". And ask any Putin supporter, they'll be happy about the invasion too
As a Russian I’m sorry that such a thing happened in our history
We, ordinary people, never wanted this and had to struggle with this oppressive regime on our own
Please don’t forget that despite the dictatorship rule and hard punishments some people actually came to the red square and protested the invasion
Maybe because it has nothing to do with actual russian people, lol
Also Putin has absolutely nothing to do with this
I hate Putin, but come on, have some historical accuracy

Yes and adhering to the five pillars of Islam is the absolute minimum to be considered a Muslim, yet here we are
People often declare a certain religion for identity reasons and not because they practise it in real life
Check out Navalny's poll from 2015 in Tatarstan and Dagestan
Lots of people declare themselves as Muslim (40%) or Christian (36%) in Tatarstan, yet many of them admit to not really follow some very basic tenets of their religion (namaz, ramadan, fasting, etc)
Dagestani Muslims are also kind of lacking really in their practises
>People are often members of churches even if they don't believe
That's not how it works in Russia
What you've got is people declaring a certain religion for identity reasons and not because they actually practise it
We can compare it with the biggest poll on religion we had in Russia  in 2012
56 900 respondents, which is really huge for a poll
Chechnya and Ingushetia were not polled and those are the most Muslim regions in Russia, so Muslims should be adjusted up  (Chukotka and Nenets AO were also not polled, but they are absolutely tiny)
Russian Orthodox: 41%, Christian: 4
1%, Other Orthodox: 1
Muslims (without Chechnya and Ingushetia): 6
Pagans: 1
Buddhists: 0
Spiritual, but not religious: 25%; atheists: 13%.
5% who can't decide and some small fries like Judaism, Catholicism, Hinduism and so on, each accounting for less than 0
5%.
No, I don't think so
The main goal of this poll was to find out how Muslims in Russia feel about Russia's intervention in Syria
So they compared Tatarstan and Dagestan because Tat has some of the most secular Muslims in Russia and Dag some of the most strict ones
Tat also has a big share of ethnic Russians (Christians), so they were used a control group
Along the way the 3 groups, Muslims/Christians in Tatarstan and Muslims in Dagestan were also asked some interesting questions about observance
How often do you go to the Mosque/Church, how often do you pray, did you fast in the Ramadan/the Great Lent, how do you feel about Sharia courts and so on
Well, no
Because it's a question of identity and not religiosity
Among other factors, there are various ethnic minorities in Russia that can be quite involved with their traditional pagan beliefs
Like Yakuts, Ossetians, Altayans, Mari
Do you speak Russian
No other polls I've seen of this nature
But there's the break down of chosen religious/secular modules for Russian 4th graders on a regional level
There's some regional variance, where Tatarstan doesn't offer any religious modules and Chechnya *only* offers two religious modules (Islam and Christianity)
But there's still a noticeable correlation between the regions that are more and less religious
Nothing comes to mind, sorry

In fact, we do
Most of Russian hard swear words (мат) branch from a small amount of roots so we have huge amount of variations  with prefixes and suffixes
For example
ебать - to fuck (someone or something, literally or figuratively) or can be used as an expression of shock (like “holy fuck” or “OMFG”)
въебать/ёбнуть - to punch/hit (well, not exactly “punch” cuz you can въебать with your leg or with a hammer but you get the idea)
съебать/съебаться - to get the fuck out
выебать - either “to fuck someone” (literally) or to win a match (sports, online games etc
разъебать - to break/crash something (like a car), OR to crush someone in a debate (разъебал по фактам)
Ебашить - to work hard OR to be moving quickly
Наебашить - to beat someone up
Наебениться - to get shitfaced (drunk)
Объебаться - to get high as fuck (on any drugs, but usually not weed cuz we have other words for that)
Ебануться - to lose your marbles, to go insane (also can be used to express surprise/shock)
Et cetera et cetera, and those are just the verbs and with just one of the roots
Or, as for the word “dick” - хуй - we have tons of words too
Хуёво - “badly”, “that sucks”.
Охуенно (sometimes spelled ахуенно) - fucking awesome
Хуета - bullshit
Дохуя - a fuckload
Нихуя - jackshit
Нихуя себе (often shortened to нихуя!, хуяссе!, or just хуя!) - holy fuck
I know, right
I’ve seen this blog before, and that’s the case for all its maps
I’m certain it’s a deliberate exclusion
Of course not
Every one of these words is a hard swear, it’s just that there’s probably not enough English analogues for them
No, they aren’t accepted like normal words and are as “hard” as the original
Most of ours swears are “swear-emphasized” normal words
It’s not like there is a swear without a normal non-swear version of that word with the same usage

Russian Empire was too underdeveloped to be totalitarian

Political talkshows are pretty much daily, so whenever the hosts wanna talk about it, they might as well update it daily, yeah
my favorite part is that russia is like 'these countries are unfriendly', so obviously the best course of action is to 'take measures to influence their actions'. Cuz of course, its the other countries that are the problem lmfao
I guess in any time, any era if Russians dictator want to make some list of their enemues, then UK is guaranteed to be there
There can be many reasons in a moment, but it all comes to soviet boomers' deep resentment towards western ex-Soviet countries and ex-Warsaw Treaty Organization members as to, and I quote a very common stamp, "ungrateful" traitors who "willingly ran to serve" Russia's adversaries "when we were weak" to threaten and to weaken Russia even more
That's a mindset which is not going away, unless naturally, and the goverment is happy to use it
The more these countries act against Putin, the more boomers believe that Russia is in a circle of enemies, the more they support Putin
They believe that this is as obvious as that the sky is blue

The last Russian poll on the topic of mixed marriages I've seen is from 2010, so it's been a while
The question was basically 'what would be your stance towards a close relative marrying someone of the following ethnicity'?
Marriage with a Jewish person - 10% positive, 37% neutral, 46% negative and 7% D/K.
Only majority positive results were for
Ethnic Russian - 70% positive, 26% neutral, 2% negative and 2% D/K.
Majority negative results
Chechen - 5% positive, 23% neutral, 65% negative and 7% D/K.
Arab - 6% positive, 23% neutral, 63% negative and 8% D/K.
Central Asian - 6% positive, 27% neutral, 60% negative and 7% D/K.
Georgian/Armenian/Azerbaijani - 7% positive, 30% neutral, 54% negative and 8% D/K.
Ukrainians and Belarusians - 37% positive, 45% neutral, 14% negative and 5% D/K.
Latvians/Lithuanians/Estonians -  14% positive, 43% neutral, 35% negative and 8% D/K.
German/French/English - 17% positive, 44% neutral, 33% negative and 7% D/K.
Americans - 14% positive, 41% neutral, 37% negative and 8 D/K.
They were lumped together in the poll, so there are no separate numbers
But I imagine that since Armenians and Georgians (probably wouldn't be much difference between the two) are Christian, they would score higher than Azerbaijanis if polled separately
Still, there are some noticeable cultural differences between Russians and all three South Caucasian ethnicities
So I don't think the difference would be that dramatic
Well, there are still a lot of cultural differences between us even if Armenians and Georgians are Christians
Including the fact that Caucasians are, well, more patriarchal and traditional than Russians
In this poll Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis were also all put in the same category
The 2008 war has not left a deep mark on the Russian psyche (I'm guessing it's different for the Georgians)
Like at all
Armenia is obviously seen as a more friendly state than Georgia
But as far as  how people are seen it hasn't changed much
Maybe Armenians are perceived more favourably, but the difference isn't pronounced at all
I've looked it up and according to a poll by Caucasus Barometer in 2015, 48% of Georgians approved of their women marrying Russians vs 46% who disapproved
Comparing with poll on marriage of women to Americans, who should be their bestest friends after all the conflicts with Russia, and it's at 42% approval vs 51% disapproval

It is understandable why is he begging for money from our beloved dictator
He wants to keep his power for as long as possible and Putin shares his interest
That’s why he just took 34$ out of every Russians pocket and handed them over to his friend in need
Oh by the way, the Health Ministry of Russia reported that there is not enough money in the budget to provide for necessary medicines against AIDS and cancer
Wouldn’t it be better to give this money to Russians in need
No, of course not

A threat
like this one
[November 2013, Western Ukraine]
Here the [same] but more impressive
"Hang a Russky" - this message was well heard in Crimea
Holding back in what
Not supporting the old song of the Russian threat
Or providing video proofs of what Ukrainian nationalism is
You guys don't hesitate to put your rusophobic puns everywhere
Now go and tell how you hate Putin, not Russians and how Crimeans would be happy in Ukraine after the coup d'etat
I don't watch Russian TV or read Russian state newspapers, I mostly read oppositional Meduza (and used to read Lenta before its chief editor left), Vedomosti, as well as BBC, Telegraph, Independent and DW
So no, I'm much more familiar with Western propagandistic machine
All your assumptions are based on Western and Ukrainian propaganda
And I have Odessa fire in May 2014 and entire Donbass to imagine what would happen to Crimeans without Russia
The moment Ukrainian mobs overthrew the elected President, thus violating the Constitution and other laws of pre-Maidan Ukraine, Crimea, as an autonomous republic, decided to protect itself from the chaos
It was the same Crimean parliament, elected according to Ukrainian laws, who voted for Russian protection and the referendum
Moreover, about 70% of Ukrainian military units based in Crimea chose to take the Russian side, while others left the peninsula peacefully
Isn't it a bit strange for a military aggression
Anyway, Crimea is open to visit
You can visit Crimea any time after the pandemic and ask locals, if you still believe that all pro-Russian Crimeans in Internet are Kremlin trolls
Btw, you could also ask them how they feel about water and electricity blockade by the Ukrainian regime
I already provided a proof of russophobic sentiments in Ukraine in 2013, before Donbass and Crimea - you preferred to ignore it, but they were students, not even Right Sector radicals, so russophobia was quite popular in 2013 among young Ukrainians
In last 6 years Ukraine enforced a number of Anti-Russian measures, including the total prohibition of Russian language as a primary language at any schools, while keeping this option for "EU languages". Now young Ukrainians write hate comments with awful mistakes in Russian, while Ukrainian minister of education writes in bad Ukrainian
Everything I see and read here is full of passive or open aggression towards Russia, Russian heritage, Russian history and Russian language
Seems like a good Russian for you is someone who despises his own people, his country, his language and his history
This is awesome
I've looked up articles written by this author, he is a total lunatic, USSR is basically his infallible God
I find it a bit amusing that you highlighted only that small part of the text when the whole site with the TV channel combined just teeming with bullshit like that
I don't know where you get it from, but nothing like this appears in the Russian media
Historians cannot find any proof that the incident happened at all, so it hardly can be considered a false flag
And a [one] and a [two] - not full-scale campaigns, obviously, but still
And no, I don't believe Finland started the Winter War, however I do believe it could've been avoided if not for the stubbornness of the Finnish government
Well, that's what you did in 1941
Finland at that time did seek a strong ally for a war with the Soviet Union
Preferably England, but Germany was fine too
This
To expand on it a bit, it's not just any hardcore commie-imperialist type of total lunatic
It's a person who calls Stalin **"a future saint of Russian Orthodox Church"** [[here, enjoy] calling for his complete and total rehabilitation
That's a level of craziness that even most of the conservative brainwashed Russians would find over the top
You stories of the Russian propaganda are in fact the Western propaganda
They look ridiculous when read from this side
In the 90s the soviet aggression was admitted and taught in schools
Maybe that's reversed now
Fortunately for the Finns, unfortunately for the 600,000 citizens of Leningrad, who were starved to death due to the Soviet Army's inability to remove the Finnish threat
Zvezda is state-supported though
Yep, that's what I'm speaking about
It's not the only time I see this absurd notion, I've seen freaks with icons of Stalin, and they pop up from time to time
But they are a marginal group, for it requires to reconcile so many contradictions in their head, for their idea of great Russia, I can only give two variants, either they're not honestly caring about anything except pushing their agenda (which is very reminiscent of the post-truth concept), believing that post-modern world has no place for such measly concerns, or are absolutely "not in touch with reality" (or both)
A very stylish photo, at first I even thought it was a poster in an old communist design
This sounds like such a holy and great moment
Remembrance of such events is very important and I'm glad the War is not forgotten yet
How do you find yours and how is it not stolen
I've travelled around Germany by bus and it's nowhere near a rare occasion
You sure can
Searching for a bike there would be hell though
You never know if it's been stolen
How much of this is true and how much is just a joke
Like, I live in West Siberia close to the Arctic Circle and +30°C is kinda fine with me
I guess that's true
With swamps all around, the only real issue is dry air, especially at winter at cold temperatures (I could barely breathe sometimes ffs)
Also, can someone send this warm weather here
It's mid-May and it's still hovering above 0°, it's annoying to see rain and snow on the same day
Don't cry, daddy is here
bruh is it okay to make an r/2balkan4you joke in here or
Ah yeah okay then
whiskered bastard
Stop making up crazy stories for a photo taken before the war
Your sick fantasy has no limits
The idea of Stalin as some sort of all-powerful dictator is definitely one of the stranger myths that has recently sprung up
He did not have any more formal authority than any other member of the Central Committee, other than the fact that he became the People's Commissar of Defense during the war against fascism and he held the military rank of Marshal
You would think that if he were a dictator he would have been able to dictate policy, but it goes without saying that that was not the case as there were so many famous examples of decisions he disagreed with being made
In terms of contemporary leaders, both Churchill and Roosevelt held more power in their respective states than Stalin did in the USSR
Edit: people are downvoting the truth now
Pathetic
Never thought I would downvote you, Enai
Ironic coming from a pole
They came really close to taking Moscow, as the front was collapsing along the Kaluga road, the holes in it were plugged with literal cadets
It wasn't a cakewalk for the German either, but with Moscow in their hands they would control the railroads running north to south, really limiting our logistics, not to mention the blow to the morale
Why downvote someone who's celebrating the Ninth of May, the Victory Day, the day when Nazis were kicked in their butts
1941 and 1812 were completely different eras
Electricity, telegraph, railroads were all routed through Moscow
Which means that our (Belarusian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Russian) heroes returned on the 9^th to tell their families "We won
Lol, what
We are literally a dictatorship
I’m fairly certain that the poll numbers don’t match reality
Most Russians didn’t even vote in the last election, because it’s obvious that Putin will just rig the whole thing and cling onto power with everything he’s got
2012, 2018, and 2019 protests were brutal
My city elected an anti Putin mayor (I guess the regional government is at least somewhat democratic), the feds swooped in, bullied him into resigning, and now we no longer have a right to vote for a mayor
My city is only governed by appointed puppets now
We still protest and petition to this day, but there’s no actual democracy in sight
I mean, if the Russian government isn’t to be trusted internationally, why should it be trusted domestically
>countries like ... crimea
a fresh take
Oh i see, blessing everything is not only a Russian tradition
Is it Cyprus in the middle
Putin’s enormous palace in Southern Russia
[More information about it
It looks neat, it’s just sad that it was built illegally for that thief
I mean, Germany is small, it will take you 5 hours of driving with your fancy autobahns
Just go there
That kapusta probably has a little bit extra kick to it now that it's expired
Also TIL Poles also call капуста kapusta
Some stores around me finally started doing this and I have no idea why it only starts happening now
It seems like a win-win for everyone tbh
Flight ban, nuclear ban
He's a burger, common sense is an alien concept to them
That's the joke
If that huge thing on the right is Russia then statistics is kinda outdated, since it has been 8+ years since the government started paying you when you get a second child and classes had increased in size up to 30 per class and in number, up to 5-6 classes per school enrolled each year, rather 3 classes 20-25 each, as it was when I entered primary school back in 2005
They used to be extremely popular where I live, I still love them
These guys made it world wide
I think I mostly remember the video games from childhood
This video is very interesting, but that guy is fucking crazy
True, I suppose
Rly want to die
This is not the kind of red that I'd like seeing on a map
no you aren't
This map is based on wrong predictions though
I remember seeing these numbers according to WHO estimates, I guess they "estimated" not much would change in Russia on the suicide front
Russia's overall suicide rate was 15
6 per 100k in 2016
(12
9 per 100k in 2018)
It's at the level of various Western European nations now and the numbers just don't break with the ones on the map
We endorse your proposal, we need sun too
it was a joke about Russia being number one if you look at it from another perspective; I don't care about karma as long as a few people get the joke, so let them downvote
The economic transition from Socialism to capitalism was a complete disaster and economically many post soviet economies still struggle
The troubles afterwards have created strong cultures of poverty
Yakuzas doesn’t give a fuck though
Well, at least one of them attempted
The last Mrs
Fuck MS Excel date
Russia, US of Europe
I think there were three in just, like, this year alone
I guess it depends on what you count as a shooting, because there was an attack involving hatchets, if I'm not mistaken
I think it might be pretty ununiform distribution in US, with gun nuts owning multiple guns and people without any
It'd be interesting to look at "armed men per 100" statistic
You meant libertarian
Oh, so Belarus and Ukraine managed to participate zero or so wars since WW2
It's beautiful
Congrats Latvia, I have always had a soft spot for you :) really hope that story we'd had stays it the books and never comes back
good luck with your independence from your watchful neighbors up north (russia)
Isn't Portugal quite cool at summers
Man, Germany is GOAT
Does it really
I see nothing relating to it
I'm disappointed it wasn't a trebuchet
That's a good one
Just look at the Albanian flag lmao
Looks legit from far, but just zoom on it
Happy birthday
# **WOOOOAAAH**
This looks basically like our new library in Halifax, Canada !
I remember my Grandma always made sure to have food on the table and more tucked away
And you never ever throw away bread
Also this [story] I read as a child was first brief look at how starvation can change people
Not a part of EU but Russia stands with you
Except for our 20 million muslim population, but don’t mind them they are wacky
Yay
I've been there
But not on the bridge itself because there were a lot of tourists
I would love to live in old town those huge wooden doors are gorgeous
That's bad, right
It has to be bad
It looks like the protestor need just a bit more of enthusiasm like I'm Ukraine
Maybe bring an ally of Russia wasn't really good for them
Just remember when, or rather if, Belarus people wins and Lukashenka is remove from power, there will be more problem like Ukraine
When Ukraine switch leader, Putin comes in
It can be another Crimea accident
I fear that our president he will do whatever he can to help Lukashenka or even remove him himself
If they storm government buildings, Russia starts actively participating
Putin said that
And also they may get shot by the police
So that is not the way they should go
I honestly don't see what can be done there as long as Russia continues helping Lukashenko in various ways
Unfortunately it's left from the USSR and Russian empire
There's no culture of democracy in Russia and Belarus yet
It's something of a propaganda trick both Russia and Belarus use to explain why are people living in such bad conditions
For Russia these "external enemies" are the US and Europe, for lukashenko they are Poland and Lithuania
It used to work some years ago but now people understand that no one gives a thing about their swamp
Is this some kind of joke or are you really trying to advocate Sharia law
This comment is retarded
From us either
Feels so good to be a country where freedom is valued
Do them on WC itself, lol
I'll join
I’m from Moscow and it’s kinda same here
Keep in mins that I said “Moscow”, not “Russia”
It's 5€ in Russ8a
TIL 12 eggs in US cost ~$1
8 and ~€2
6 in France
compositionally seems too perfect with the worker and kolhoznica projecting movement forwards and upwards contrasted against the monolith of the nazi pavilion - immovable object and an unstoppable force
It doesn't, this map is a load of bullshit
There are 268 "places" (cities, towns, villages) with 1000+ pop in my region yet this map shows only ~60-70
The highest score of negative
I feel proud
As Russian, I am actually glad how much British dislike my country
In recent years our government has done so much seriously messed up shit
It is not surprising that some Russians like me hate it but we are robbed of pretty any chance to be finally heard and make a difference
It seems that just like in Belarus, Putin has lost his senses and would protect his grip on power even at cost of thousands of innocent lives and mass application of brutal force
Just writing this to remind that not all Russians approve our government
LOL I knew we're gonna be last XDD
very proud to be russian /s
Meh
[r/Russophobic]
You call this hate
Thanks
But here you will get a lot of dislikes for this comment
wow, you surprised me
I never expected a Brit to like us
Thank you
But only because of the Eurotrip
I totally agree
I remember talking about that with different people in Europe, from Britain or from other countries and usually they state that the negativity is towards Putin, not the people
Can't blame them
True, but to be fair that case is very intricate and honestly I don't believe there is a solid evidence of Russian involvement or the contrary
All our points of view are relying too much on propaganda from both sides
Few months back there was a poll about introducing changes in Russian constitution which would among other things would allow Putin to hold his power
Officially it was called referendum but there was a lot of controversies surrounding it including eliminating all public control to ensure its fairness
By official numbers around 21% were against constitution changes and the opposition produced estimate that actually 45% were against
Both numbers should be taken with a grain of salt but it shows that even the opposition see that they are not overwhelming majority
Still even official numbers show that government critics are not just some miniscule minority
Did you know that colours of Russian flag can be spelled as 'krasnyi'(red), 'goluboi' (light blue) and 'belyi' (white)
And the first letters of these words form KGB
****tinfoil intensifies****
Once I told my grandma that I’m going to Canada, she asked isn’t it dangerous for a citizen of a WarPac country to travel to a NATO country
She’s aware that there is no Eastern block or USSR, she just used to call certain regions in certain ways and just doesn’t feel the need to change her vocabulary
I guess many people who travel to Czechoslovakia are also just used to say it instead of Czechia
I have long lost my faith in humanity
People constantly draw connection between ideas and the person who said it
For example, find some inspiring and reasonable quote from Hitler and see how everyone would lose their minds
Still it is just tip of iceberg
For starters look at list of logical fallacies on Wikipedia, I think there is around 50-60 positions in it
And the go for cognitive biases and there is like 200-300 of them
I just gave up on remembering them all, human intelligence is so flawed it is not even funny
Your only hope is to learn more about that and spread the message
I don't want to argue on a subject I have little true information about, my point is, no solid evidence of usage of nerve agent or the involvement of Russia is published
To be fair, I'm not saying that Russia wasn't involved because no solid proof of that either
So all negative attitude is mainly because of propaganda
True or not only time will reveal

Unfortunately, we will probably never hear such kind words from European community because of our policy
Anyways,I still love you, Europeans and British people, and I hope we will be much more close than now
Greetings from Siberia, Russia
God damn what the fuck is going on there
Why
Poland but
in Russian
In Russia the same situation
I live near Moscow and 25C is good weather now, not so hot))
I’m not even scared anymore, my scare receptors are all fried out
Between the whole world going to hell and Putin pulling a Xi Jimping, I don’t even feel anything anymore
Idk
Why yes
Now it’s weirder so it makes more sense to me now
Lol I thought it's Russan but with a weirder looking ш letter
But still, why is it in Ukrainian now
What’s the deal with writing the name of your country in a different language
Yeah that makes sense
Oh my god, that face expression is priceless
Bryansk strong
Is that law actually stops them, though
I mean in Russia any promotional calls made without your consent are illegal, but those spammers just aren't under our jurisdiction ot something and basically call whenever they want anyway
Come on Iceland, get yourself together    /s
Because pollution
Thanks germany/poland
I see that I have upset people ashamed of their CO2 bottom line
Lol Romania worst slavs
You should replace vodka with Recursion for extra class
Recursion is a simple, but tasty cocktail: one part vodka, one part Recursion
Takes too long to make, though
Poland is slowly being overtaken by Latvians and Belorussians
This is so stupid
I love it
grain vodka > potato vodka
I've cycled from Munich to Rome this August and can confirm Italian part, though I don't speak Italian I knew few words (Buongiorno
Si, coretto
) and learned some during my trip
Even simple lines like "succo di mela, grazie" (apple juice, thanks) made people smile
For Germany I was told Bavarians appreciate if you speak the language and if someone didn't speak English well, I tried my best speaking German
I think the whole idea of Germans speaking English is formed by "Ordnung muss sein" ("there must be order") cliche
Like, this person needs something, let's not confuse him with words he may not understand

Every single US president since WW2 is a war criminal
It has nothing to do with the electoral system, but the system as a whole
War and imperialism is bipartisan
Democrats who now lambast Trump for this just recenlty voted for giving him even bigger military budget, and killed the parts of the bill that would stop him doing just that
The only people voting against were progressives like Bernie and AOC
So, do not fool yourself thinking this is somehow unique to Trump or Republicans
Clinton is a massive warhawk
She had her own "blunders" with Lybia, and she was pushing Trump to be more agressive in Syria
What she would've done we don't know, but we can be pretty certain she would at the very least maintain the status quo
And given the example of Obama, yes he didn't start a mess like Iraq, but his also massively increased drone strikes, bombed seven countries (to a point where he literally ran out of bombs), and was assassinating American citizens without a trial
And of course the whole Yemen genocide thing
I would harly call that "lesser evil".
I used to get mad at my school
For some reason it scared me a lot when I was a child and it still gives me the uncanny valley vibes lol
But the monument itself is glorious
I know it supposed to be offensive, but damn, that art style is awesome
So,i guess we don't need any other data maps
Locals don’t go there
At least, not very often, maybe once a season or something
(I’m a local)
Moscow has a population of almost 13 million people (officially, I’m sure that in reality the number is much higher), it’s not a lot of people in the photo, it’s less people than I would see if I would look out of my window on a rainy day
In fact, I would consider this amount of people as “empty red square” lol
And it is just "white male" for American police
Boring
Poland is a stain on Europe
Don't write me off as a hypocrite, burning hatred for fellow Russians burns through me just as much
Frendly reminder from a French dude that peaceful protests don't do shit, time to fight those pigs
Well he's not a traitor, but a shity politician for sure
He doesn't have any interesting or grabbing ideas, plans or suggestions, besides populism
Even his views transform to fit the mass opinion
His whole personality as a politician is based on opposing Putin, although the only difference between them is one having the power and other doesn't.
His correct position on Crimea is to hold an open and fair referendum, allow time for propaganda about returning to Ukraine, invite all necessary international officials to confirm legitimacy, and give the Crimeans a real choice (not like 2014 one)
Still think abortion without special circumstances is obviously a murder, but it should be allowed in case of rape or death of a fetus and investigated as quickly as possible to avoid any unfortunate cases
Silly Americans thinking it'll make any difference, for God's sake it won't change anything + his politicy that Russia is the main threat when China is getting stronger and stronger is just stupid
>A mockery of democracy
Another evidence that Lukashenko is mentally ill or just stupid
Russia has nothing
No economy, no allied countries, and nothing that can somehow hurt America
China on the other hand has almost entirely self sufficient economy that without trade war WILL pass USA economy
Thats quite a bit of people,looks like Lukashenko already lost
People are really fighting against injustice
People are fighting for their future
Not a broken window, not a burned-out car :) Жыве Беларусь. Молодцы!
Lukashenka, who is in power for 26 years, "won" elections by falsifying results while in reality he has from 3 to 20% of support
On the first three days of protests several thousand protesters were arrested and tortured, some protesters were killed
Shit
OP, I hope your car is fine

Overton window as it is
I actually wanted to write pretty big comment,but since nobody will ever read it,it just a waste of time
So,to keep it simple - You insulting memory of my heroic ancestors,who was communist and saved a lot of your sorry asses from being soap in nazis houses,and shoes on their feets
Fuck you,if you support this view of equality of logos above,and while you obviously not douche as Hitler was,you going right the same way
Don't give a damn how much downvotes modern day nazi-wannabe will click,since in Russia saying things like this to the mans face might end up in broken nose
Immediately
And well deserved
Tragedy build on political agenda
From my point of view,worst kind of tragedy
Once,things will be clear,i think it will be some time after Ukraine finally manages to lose all value as weapon against Russia,and then
Then quite a bit of the world will have hard time to explain their reasons
But it won't even be justice for victims,cause everything is shady for 6
years by now
I hope we will never see anything like this
but sadly,we already did

I've visited Bulgaria a few weeks ago
Amazing country, it reminded me of Russia but with a more pleasant climate and cleaner streets
It's interesting to me what problems it's facing currently
>Yeltsin create oligarchs and failed to change country for better
Wasn't just bad luck
Yeltsin had [help] And mass privatization that helped create the oligarchs was spearheaded by Americane economists, as they were trying to "liberalize the markets".
Vladimir is a chosen  by people president of Russia,with overwhelming support
Atleast atm
Most of people organizing this (and most of others) protest - never did and never wanted to do anything good for Russia
Some of them despised by majority of russians
Mind you - if you had more information about them,most of the sub couldn't support them aswell
EU-Russia alliance is an amazing idea,but won't happen as long as anti-russian NATO exists
[This is what the central hall looks like]
I'm talking about the grayness of the stations and completely forgot about [this] : D
You are right
Initially, the stations of the first section of the Big Circle Line (Savelovskaya - Shelepikha) should be the same and have sliding doors
But then the project was changed for the rest of the stations
And Savelovskaya was built according to the original project but without doors
Our mayor is criticized by many for this, calling him a fan of "50 Shades of Gray".
It's just the design
But in Moscow there is [a station] with trophy cases
The length of the station is 163 meters
The width is most likely standard, so it's about 10 meters
Yes
It depends on what is considered a crowd
Although in Moscow there are stations at which you curse everything in the world if you find yourself there at rush hour
Almost everyone likes **this** station
But many don't like the fact that almost all new stations are either gray or gray with some bright color (but still gray)
Check in from Russia

I really enjoy the art style but I hate the message
I think the current national flag of Belarus is really good and I like it a lot and I would like to have something similar for Russia, but at least I have the flag of my region
It is actually not just the “list of countries Russia do not like”, but it is actually a list of countries that can’t employ Russians for their diplomatic missions and vise versa
Or something like this, that’s what I heard and how I understood this
What the hell is this
Accurate enough but I would add also Bulgaria and Moldova to this list
Half of comments from Romanians
Fuck your so called friendship
Personally, I want this relationship: Hi

Bye

And no one meddles in other people's business (if it does not harm your interests)
Bloody hell, what a fucking joke
The debased behaviour of my government and people affiliated with it never stopped embarrassing me, but lately it is somehow getting even worse
this always happens, as an example after the revolution in Iran, the pro-Western government became anti-Western the same thing in Cuba and Venezuela and it will be the same in any country after any revolution
The users there have eventually turned into some cringy "patriots" with a single opinion on everything, which made me quit the place, don't think it was like that before
Or maybe I just wasn't paying attention
You are kind of an exemplary neutral neighbor
Yeah it actually says the same thing that is said in the title - the list of the unfriendly countries, where “unfriendly” means not that “they don’t like us” but “we don’t like them”. I just said what it actually means because that’s not just some random list made up by tv
Congrats
High five
Unfortunately, things can only go down from here
Iron curtain in next 10 years, feud between oligarchs after Putin's death and an emergence of someone even more fucked up than Putin as a result
People can have different opinion about Navalny, but this situation is horrible
I really hope that he'll be fine
Oh my,i knew exactly what type of comments this thread will be filled with
First of all - Get well soon,dude
You might be a dick,but health is no-joke subject
To consider him a 'Putin opponent' is super-naive
Easier said then done, honestly
I was organizing a protest last year, local eco problems
Few months later I had problems when I was about to have a flight to Moldova/Israel
They literally stopped me and started to ask a whole bunch of questions (usually just let me cross the border)
Also, I know a local politician, wery brave man, he is about to get arrested
[proof, but in russian, sorry]
But mean, we have to protest, we must do it, but it's stating to get scary
I'm thinking about relocation
Maybe I'm a bad person for doing it, but at least I'll stay alive
He got super-wierd history,and nowadays mostly blogger for wealthy high-school kids
Also,he got close to none government experience nor management on any scale
This and his support being no more than 3% of population results in him having no chances to be any kind of big politician in Russia
But he for some reason very hyped by Western media
Hyped FAAAAAAAAAR beyond his capabilities
Damn the Swedes invent everything
The side view are a little disappointing
I wanted something more unusual
Christian church looks literally like a door to Valhalla
Ironical, but yet so gorgeous

Wait, there are TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN mink farms in Denmark
The fact that in the country portrayed by the media as a very progressive one there is even one mink farm
Crimea always wanted to leave Ukraine
1991 Crimean sovereignty referendum: [
1994 President of Crimea [
June 2006, Feodosiya Crimean anti-NATO protest (with Russian flags):  [
> Putin could have easily initiated a referendum in Crimea about joining Russia
Such a referendum, no matter who initiated it, would be directly against the Ukrainian laws
Crimea has had independence  referendums before; in 1991 and 1994, if I'm not mistaken
Ukraine just ignored them and rightly so, coz crimeans had to win at an all-Ukraine referendum in order to secede
Which was never going to happen, obviously, so the whole point of referendums like that is moot
Countries, normally, are not happy about the perspective of losing valuable lands
Speaking of the Eastern Europe, The USSR was an exception, in terms of a relatively peaceful dissolution
Relatively, as in "not ended up with millions of deaths", that is
Happy independence day from a Russian,it’s a shame that my government is so hostile against y’all ️
Happy Independence Day
I genuinely hope y’all keep it
From Russia with love
Its your day,folks
Oh,and don't forget what 'independence' means
This and removal of nazi slogan might make you a lot more 'друзi'.
Sometimes yes
I’m live in Russia
My mom ethnically Russian and my dad Ukrainian
Our family lived in southern Russia and we often visited our relatives in Ukraine and everything seemed alright, it was one country, it was easy to live here and travel
But 31 years ago my motherland, USSR, was destroyed and separated by nationalists leaders
Now we have different countries, different official languages, different currencies, different laws
Can I accept it
Yes
Should I celebrate it
I don’t think so
Not in my country, in our country
:) During Soviet times we hadn’t “Russian state” we had a common country - the Union
Most of Ukrainians wanted independence from USSR because of huge crisis in 1988-1991
Nationalist propaganda made them believe that “Moscow takes all money, if we will become independent we will be rich as France”. This all was a total bullshit and shameless lie
Whole nation was brainwashed
But I clearly understand USSR never come back
It’s a sad true for me and many people in Russia and Ukraine
I’m not a communist or some crazy Stalin fan, I’m just think that living in united country would be a much better for Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians
If you really want to piss off Russians you should change USSR to Russian Khanate or exclude it altogether
Nah
I prefer Russia to remain capitalist, thank you very much
It seems like it's time for you to feed your pink winged unicorn
I like [this photo] where their tops are above clouds
From [this surrealistic set] taken from [the Ostankino tower]
Mean no offence, but from my point of view as a Muscovite, it's mostly cars on non-moscow plates that usually come off as a nuisance on the road, because their drivers can't keep up with the flow
I mean, time is money and we have places to go, right
If some people can't drive in a big city (which is pretty much normal and definitely not something to be ashamed of), they better take a bus or metro
That being said, the older I get, the slower I drive
After I gave up with "sport-ish" cars, I started driving a rather slow 4x4 and have not got a speeding ticket in ages
[They are testing it at Kalashnikov's labs]
That’s not so sad at all, my friend
I think because your society now have an opportunity to insist on its own values
If you’ll have a deal in EU - that’s fine
If not, there are other cultures around which are close to your culture too
Becoming a nation from Polandball propaganda comics without a chance to do something with it would be much worse
By not becoming the first colony inside EU, with all the obligations and no right to participate in decision making
They cannot join Eurasian Union
It's easy to say SIMPLY when someone else has already done it
*joke about how Montenegro seceded from Yugoslavia last*
So now you know that we like memes here in Russia
Chad Russian shaman 100%
Москва с Беларусью, Хабаровск тоже, давите таракана, чтобы нахер следа от него не осталось.
Basically, it is a russification (belarusification also) of the word "militia"
That's what law enforcement service was called in USSR and is still called in Belarus (Russia switched to "police" in 2011)
Happy independence day Lithuania
I would really like to have a universal IT-based system to catch all thèse corrupted politicians
I found ladin, qumuq, nogaysha, qarachay-malqar and only then Russian, the language I was looking for
So this test doesn't work for Russian much, but making it still would be a great amount of work, thanks for sharing
Where is Scunthrope or Penistone
Has the Belgian Parliament already approved how many days a year Belgians will have to crawl on their knees apologizing
The humor is the best answer always
But we don't crawl on the knees here :)
omg totally works with me
I really hope for a peaceful solution for this conflict and hope there're not going to be act deaths from both sides
I don't like Navalny, but it's a shame that Judge has sentenced him
The president of the court had resigned before the hearing, the judge Yulia Okuneva had decided not to take part in the process
A good example of the postulate that there's always a choice
But judge Natalya Repnikova sentenced Navalny
His views are pretty radical, he's a nationalist by himself and member of several ultraright/nationalist organizations
In his twitter he speaks disrespectfuly about a lot of people with a lot of profanity and insults, so it makes me feel he has no manners
Also he was supporting conflict between Russia and Georgia and always was saying it's time to stop to feed Caucasus
Вот тут развёрнутая статья [Почему ушёл глава суда]
Mate, he attends every annual Russian march, Navalny has n't changed his views
"No European in any part of the world will be able to walk the streets calmly and safely

upd
I beg your pardon, the speech was in 2017, here is the video
[ (twitter

I apologize, i changed the message
Totally not true for Russia
In reality, only about 1
78% attain churches at Easter and at Christmas - that's an absolute minimum to be considered a Christian
Since they believe in an angry Jewish old man who lives on a cloud and conduct rituals apparently to please him, I think that we should count only those people who play part in rituals
Since Russia is a police state, we have statistics from cops - they guard all churches during major holidays and literally count people who enter church territories
Of course the church pretends that most Russians are Christians, but in reality it is literally rare
In Russian Burger King you could take 1230 grams of chicken wings for 10 pounds
About 860 Roubles, but depends on exchange rate
11 000 Roubles is even less than a formal “minimal wage” which is a standard unit for various calculations
In reality, if the Federal Tax Bureau will see such wage in accounting documents, full check with deep anal inspection is inevitable since no one really works for such sums
Average wage in Moscow in 2018 was [80 800 Roubles] And, what foreigners usually do not understand from Russian statistics is:
Wages typically represent only 1/3 to 1/4 of incomes
Incomes are counted only as officially declared
Some coefficients for the shadow part of economy are used, but they are never realistic
Realistically, the shadow part is about 40% of GDP
Really
I'd still prefer chicken wings
Not giving a shit is true
But If you count only those that care, the majority supports (surprise
) Putin
As I’ve said under the previous post with the same topic, this is actually not just a list of the “we don’t like them” countries
This list is basically a list of countries, whose governments won’t be able to hire Russian citizens to work in their diplomatic missions
As far as I know, the list itself wasn’t yet shown so idk where they got this thing on tv
Edit: at the same time USA embassy stopped giving people in Russia all kinds of visas except for the diplomatic visas and “the minimal amount of the immigration visas”. Well, I am now late to visit USA
Edit2: I do not work for the government lol
I don’t even support it, I literally was in the goddamn protests in 2012 and I continue to support the opposition by this day just more silently because I don’t have spare money to bail myself out of the jail ffs
Nor do i have the physical and mental health for it
I do not try to normalise anything here - I was literally just spreading information about what it actually means for people who were interested
Idk, when I fist saw that stupid list name, I for sure was interested about what it actually means
That’s it
If you see Russian spies everywhere - it would probably be a good idea to get a cup of tea and lay down for a bit
Honestly, I didn’t mean a single bad thing and I tried to be as neutral as possible
I wonder why didn't they include basically every conutry on this planet already
Only then it would match our propaganda
Okay okay with little exceptions like Lukhashenko's half-failed regime and a bunch of other countries like Venezuela, whose credits were pardoned from civil russians' taxes
Oh, when (I hope) our country gets rid out if authoritarianism, it will be such a hard time to clean all this diplomatic mess created by our current gov morons
I really hope that my motherland will be diplomatically civilized and friendly some day
(In parallel with solving-internal-matters-isolationism)
I have no fucking words
Every time I think my country's leadership can't get any worse, I get unpleasantly surprised
probably the government reads me, now we are waiting for Moldova
[List of Russia's "unfriendly countries" according to Russian state TV : europe (reddit
com)]
The TV is fully controlled by our government what do you expect, 3 biggest channels talk about politics at least 4 hours a day
Russophobic countries, they hate Russia and the Russian people, they blame Russia for all sins without proof
Mostly these are not independent countries, they just do what the owner orders to them
You will not find independent countries with their own army on such lists, such as India or China
As, for example, in early April, the US said that the Czechs would abandon the agreement with Russia on the construction of a nuclear power plant
Just after in mid-April, the Czechs had to come up with the idea that the Russians blew something up, as always, without proof, as a result, the Czechs refused to build with the Russians
Very strange behavior like this can be found with every country on the list

Every single US president since WW2 is a war criminal
It has nothing to do with the electoral system, but the system as a whole
War and imperialism is bipartisan
Democrats who now lambast Trump for this just recenlty voted for giving him even bigger military budget, and killed the parts of the bill that would stop him doing just that
The only people voting against were progressives like Bernie and AOC
So, do not fool yourself thinking this is somehow unique to Trump or Republicans
Clinton is a massive warhawk
She had her own "blunders" with Lybia, and she was pushing Trump to be more agressive in Syria
What she would've done we don't know, but we can be pretty certain she would at the very least maintain the status quo
And given the example of Obama, yes he didn't start a mess like Iraq, but his also massively increased drone strikes, bombed seven countries (to a point where he literally ran out of bombs), and was assassinating American citizens without a trial
And of course the whole Yemen genocide thing
I would harly call that "lesser evil".
I used to get mad at my school
For some reason it scared me a lot when I was a child and it still gives me the uncanny valley vibes lol

Moscow has a population of almost 13 million people (officially, I’m sure that in reality the number is much higher), it’s not a lot of people in the photo, it’s less people than I would see if I would look out of my window on a rainy day
In fact, I would consider this amount of people as “empty red square” lol
And it is just "white male" for American police
Boring
Poland is a stain on Europe
Don't write me off as a hypocrite, burning hatred for fellow Russians burns through me just as much
Frendly reminder from a French dude that peaceful protests don't do shit, time to fight those pigs
Well he's not a traitor, but a shity politician for sure
He doesn't have any interesting or grabbing ideas, plans or suggestions, besides populism
Even his views transform to fit the mass opinion
His whole personality as a politician is based on opposing Putin, although the only difference between them is one having the power and other doesn't.
His correct position on Crimea is to hold an open and fair referendum, allow time for propaganda about returning to Ukraine, invite all necessary international officials to confirm legitimacy, and give the Crimeans a real choice (not like 2014 one)
Still think abortion without special circumstances is obviously a murder, but it should be allowed in case of rape or death of a fetus and investigated as quickly as possible to avoid any unfortunate cases
Silly Americans thinking it'll make any difference, for God's sake it won't change anything + his politicy that Russia is the main threat when China is getting stronger and stronger is just stupid
>A mockery of democracy
Another evidence that Lukashenko is mentally ill or just stupid
Russia has nothing
No economy, no allied countries, and nothing that can somehow hurt America
China on the other hand has almost entirely self sufficient economy that without trade war WILL pass USA economy
Thats quite a bit of people,looks like Lukashenko already lost
People are really fighting against injustice
People are fighting for their future

So,to keep it simple - You insulting memory of my heroic ancestors,who was communist and saved a lot of your sorry asses from being soap in nazis houses,and shoes on their feets
Fuck you,if you support this view of equality of logos above,and while you obviously not douche as Hitler was,you going right the same way
Don't give a damn how much downvotes modern day nazi-wannabe will click,since in Russia saying things like this to the mans face might end up in broken nose
Immediately
And well deserved
Tragedy build on political agenda
From my point of view,worst kind of tragedy
Once,things will be clear,i think it will be some time after Ukraine finally manages to lose all value as weapon against Russia,and then
Then quite a bit of the world will have hard time to explain their reasons
But it won't even be justice for victims,cause everything is shady for 6
years by now
I hope we will never see anything like this

Amazing country, it reminded me of Russia but with a more pleasant climate and cleaner streets
It's interesting to me what problems it's facing currently
>Yeltsin create oligarchs and failed to change country for better
Wasn't just bad luck
Yeltsin had [help] And mass privatization that helped create the oligarchs was spearheaded by Americane economists, as they were trying to "liberalize the markets".
Vladimir is a chosen  by people president of Russia,with overwhelming support
Atleast atm
Most of people organizing this (and most of others) protest - never did and never wanted to do anything good for Russia
Some of them despised by majority of russians
Mind you - if you had more information about them,most of the sub couldn't support them aswell
EU-Russia alliance is an amazing idea,but won't happen as long as anti-russian NATO exists
[This is what the central hall looks like]
I'm talking about the grayness of the stations and completely forgot about [this] : D
You are right
Initially, the stations of the first section of the Big Circle Line (Savelovskaya - Shelepikha) should be the same and have sliding doors
But then the project was changed for the rest of the stations
And Savelovskaya was built according to the original project but without doors
Our mayor is criticized by many for this, calling him a fan of "50 Shades of Gray".
It's just the design
But in Moscow there is [a station] with trophy cases
The length of the station is 163 meters
The width is most likely standard, so it's about 10 meters
Yes
It depends on what is considered a crowd
Although in Moscow there are stations at which you curse everything in the world if you find yourself there at rush hour
Almost everyone likes **this** station
But many don't like the fact that almost all new stations are either gray or gray with some bright color (but still gray)

I really enjoy the art style but I hate the message

It is actually not just the “list of countries Russia do not like”, but it is actually a list of countries that can’t employ Russians for their diplomatic missions and vise versa
Or something like this, that’s what I heard and how I understood this
What the hell is this
Accurate enough but I would add also Bulgaria and Moldova to this list
Half of comments from Romanians

Bloody hell, what a fucking joke
The debased behaviour of my government and people affiliated with it never stopped embarrassing me, but lately it is somehow getting even worse
this always happens, as an example after the revolution in Iran, the pro-Western government became anti-Western the same thing in Cuba and Venezuela and it will be the same in any country after any revolution
The users there have eventually turned into some cringy "patriots" with a single opinion on everything, which made me quit the place, don't think it was like that before
Or maybe I just wasn't paying attention
You are kind of an exemplary neutral neighbor
Yeah it actually says the same thing that is said in the title - the list of the unfriendly countries, where “unfriendly” means not that “they don’t like us” but “we don’t like them”. I just said what it actually means because that’s not just some random list made up by tv
Congrats
High five
Unfortunately, things can only go down from here
Iron curtain in next 10 years, feud between oligarchs after Putin's death and an emergence of someone even more fucked up than Putin as a result
People can have different opinion about Navalny, but this situation is horrible
I really hope that he'll be fine
Oh my,i knew exactly what type of comments this thread will be filled with
First of all - Get well soon,dude
You might be a dick,but health is no-joke subject
To consider him a 'Putin opponent' is super-naive
Easier said then done, honestly
I was organizing a protest last year, local eco problems
Few months later I had problems when I was about to have a flight to Moldova/Israel
They literally stopped me and started to ask a whole bunch of questions (usually just let me cross the border)
Also, I know a local politician, wery brave man, he is about to get arrested
[proof, but in russian, sorry]
But mean, we have to protest, we must do it, but it's stating to get scary
I'm thinking about relocation
Maybe I'm a bad person for doing it, but at least I'll stay alive
He got super-wierd history,and nowadays mostly blogger for wealthy high-school kids
Also,he got close to none government experience nor management on any scale
This and his support being no more than 3% of population results in him having no chances to be any kind of big politician in Russia
But he for some reason very hyped by Western media
Hyped FAAAAAAAAAR beyond his capabilities
Damn the Swedes invent everything
The side view are a little disappointing

Crimea always wanted to leave Ukraine
1991 Crimean sovereignty referendum: [
1994 President of Crimea [
June 2006, Feodosiya Crimean anti-NATO protest (with Russian flags):  [
> Putin could have easily initiated a referendum in Crimea about joining Russia
Such a referendum, no matter who initiated it, would be directly against the Ukrainian laws
Crimea has had independence  referendums before; in 1991 and 1994, if I'm not mistaken
Ukraine just ignored them and rightly so, coz crimeans had to win at an all-Ukraine referendum in order to secede
Which was never going to happen, obviously, so the whole point of referendums like that is moot
Countries, normally, are not happy about the perspective of losing valuable lands
Speaking of the Eastern Europe, The USSR was an exception, in terms of a relatively peaceful dissolution
Relatively, as in "not ended up with millions of deaths", that is
Happy independence day from a Russian,it’s a shame that my government is so hostile against y’all ️
Happy Independence Day

This and removal of nazi slogan might make you a lot more 'друзi'.
Sometimes yes
I’m live in Russia
My mom ethnically Russian and my dad Ukrainian
Our family lived in southern Russia and we often visited our relatives in Ukraine and everything seemed alright, it was one country, it was easy to live here and travel
But 31 years ago my motherland, USSR, was destroyed and separated by nationalists leaders
Now we have different countries, different official languages, different currencies, different laws
Can I accept it
Yes
Should I celebrate it
I don’t think so
Not in my country, in our country
:) During Soviet times we hadn’t “Russian state” we had a common country - the Union
Most of Ukrainians wanted independence from USSR because of huge crisis in 1988-1991
Nationalist propaganda made them believe that “Moscow takes all money, if we will become independent we will be rich as France”. This all was a total bullshit and shameless lie
Whole nation was brainwashed
But I clearly understand USSR never come back
It’s a sad true for me and many people in Russia and Ukraine
I’m not a communist or some crazy Stalin fan, I’m just think that living in united country would be a much better for Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians
If you really want to piss off Russians you should change USSR to Russian Khanate or exclude it altogether
Nah
I prefer Russia to remain capitalist, thank you very much

Mean no offence, but from my point of view as a Muscovite, it's mostly cars on non-moscow plates that usually come off as a nuisance on the road, because their drivers can't keep up with the flow
I mean, time is money and we have places to go, right
If some people can't drive in a big city (which is pretty much normal and definitely not something to be ashamed of), they better take a bus or metro
That being said, the older I get, the slower I drive
After I gave up with "sport-ish" cars, I started driving a rather slow 4x4 and have not got a speeding ticket in ages

If you’ll have a deal in EU - that’s fine
If not, there are other cultures around which are close to your culture too

Long ago, in the Soviet times, he and his classmates with a teacher went backpack camping
No good maps and Iphones at that time /s
Thus camping some day they reached Latvia
And at a some point needed a help with the direction - where to should they turn
Helpfully they noticed a local
Went to him and asked
Sure, in Russian, because they did not know Latvian
He pointed the way
They began to move
Have passed 20 meters or so
And children began chatting in Lithuanian
He had heard that (Lithuanian
), run to them and said: sorry, I pointed you the wrong way, you should go different, there
Such a story of a famous Soviet internationalism /s
We have even 130 (for example, part of the Moscow- St-Petersburg highway)
And up to +20 is not punished
Never ever I was flashed like this
If I see somebody going closer and closer to me, sure faster than me, I switch my turn lights right, and the moment when possible, merge into the righter lane
Be attentive and polite
I've seen also that the limits are different for cars and lorries-tracks
> I should also mention that highways are almost non-existant outside Moscow and St
Petersburg
Wrong
Take  M4 'Don' highway, FEx
(And also 130 at some parts)
>everyone drives 80
:)) try to do it in Moscow, St-Petersburg
but almost everywhere at a day time
Он всегда об этом думает
OK, you are right :)
Да ну? Мы больше всех стонем, какие гадости принёс нам коммунизм? Нет, а ведь мы натерпелись от него больше всех. Мы победители! а остальные могут идти на... все четыре стороны,
вспоминать как их, несчастных, пять раз делили державы-победители.
Кто мне нравится? Сталин? Нет, я антикоммунист. А бабушки мне нравятся, потому что это мои бабушки!
Putin\-Putin\-Putin, sure
We are everywhere
Just tell me, a man who says: 'Either I will be a prime minister, or there will be no prime minister at all",
has anything to to with democracy
Sure
There would be lot of blood then
> we could travel to Ukraine without issues
Will you explain to foreigners that it is not Putin who do not allow you to travel there
Say this to Poland :)
Here is Russian
I do not like my state for being too democratic
Умерла мама. Год назад.
Да ты просто говно.
Не отрицаю, и в России случается.
Depends on your taste/preferences in music
I listen them all the time
Every album released was the same time in the USSR
Not as officially sold, but brought here from abroad by people
To add: They were praised by the officials in the USSR for the "Dark Side of the Moon"? and "The Wall", but after "The Final Cut" forgot instantly and sort of prohibited
It is all about Russian trade sanctions
(Now we buy them as Belorussian)
> rewriting history: claims the false fla
No, not rewriting
Leaving it the way it was in Soviets
Alas, and bad, it is still more or less official point of view, though there are studies of Russian historians that show some indirect, circumstantial evidence that the shelling was made by our artillery
Alas, again - no direct orders have been found (or showed to public)
Yes
But not many people in free Europe can imagine that we in free Russia allow to be lunatics on our TV not state-supported
> Zvezda is state-supported though
Does not mean State-cenzored
For me - there should be tables
a) Usually you tаке a few books
b) and you make notes
Library is for study and work
We Russians are not allowed to say this here :)
BTW, Churchill (hated communism all his life) in his memoirs wrote that the discussed pact was vise Stalin's political move
And that without taking the lands in 1939 the USSR would have much bitter destiny in the outcoming war
And if it lost, Britain will not have a chance
He was very aware of the least in 1941
> declared war on Germany over Poland
So called 'Phoney War'. Declared and did nothing
Such commemoration I will readily join
Overall right, but let me clarify some
overall number of 'political prisoners' of Khrushchev to Gorbachev were 6 543
About 5 000 of them of Khrushchev
Yes
Thank you
Rather good collection of British and US WWII posters
(Some British are translated to use in the USSR)
I wonder, what would the same polls show
if made in Germany simultaneously
(And what would be the % for France there
Because of Propaganda, Sir
>  because of Stalin that Hitler was able to reach the heights that he did
Did not this heights began in Munich with your Chamberlain and their Mussolini and Daladier
Everybody outside is watching Hollywood
Yes
And the very good Czechoslovakian military factories
Sure, you know the figures how many tanks were build there for Germany after that
> radar, code breaking
None of this was granted to the USSR
So what is the conclusion
You should not study history by movies
And Brits have their 'Dunkerk'. And Polish their
(list is too long)
> the material benefits for UK and France
It greatly benefited Germany which heights we are speaking about
Saving them from war (though temporarily, as it happened), the same as for the Soviets
But for the USSR it was some /s later
It just followed the flaw :)
> Winston Churchill — 'You were given the choice between war and dishonour
You chose dishonour, and you will have war
> Germany starts to become a threat
And
That allowed Germany to make a navy
Yes
And the Navy Pact with the UK
Good clarification, thank you
> strategic war resources
Let's listen to Czech
All major news have it
'No comment' style
I have payed VPN
I use it only to watch my favorite movie source that was banned half a year ago for piracy
Free VPN happened to be slow in the rush time
Relax
It is not dangerous in Russia to have different opinions, to be in the opposition, or to read foreign news
Do not listen to any propaganda \- be it ours or yours
>exaggerates
Yes, sure
Nemtcov \- strange story
He was dead politician long before he became dead man
Journalist killings \- not on politics
We see really opposite journalists here
Openly claiming to give Ukraine back, naming Putin a thief and so on
Nothing happens to them
Congratulations
I started for England, and it was rather dull
But after your first goal everything changed magically
You were clever, witty, fast, beautiful
From that point on I was with Croats with all my heart
Such a game
I hope you will do it in final
(/s And we need it - if Croatia becomes the champion, we will say proudly - ha, we lost to them only by penalty /s)
It has some bad connotations
Sorry for my English if so
Not so, After 1:1 Croats waked up and became so beautiful in their game, I can not stand to start sympathizing
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Alarming news from the border
Vigilant raven of Finnish guards notices sneaking Russian bear
Later Strelka gave birth to puppies
One of them, named Pushinka (Fuzz) was presented by Khrushchev to John F. Kennedy (then POTUS)
It is also placed on "European Square" ("Площадь Европы"), hence the flag and the name
Our fair pray
Sometimes it led to the funny stories

They acquired the power to accurately judge other people's abilities by looking at their faces
Isn't it remarkable
Finally, looks like more official details about one of the most shameful events in the history of the modern Russia
I hope they make a full report available to the public, I would really like to read it
The previous reports by the Dutch Safety Board have been very detailed
I wonder if it will be possible to actually prosecute the criminals, though
I'm fairly sure most Russians don't believe the official version and blame the Ukrainians
The Dutch Safety Boards seems to agree
I'll just fully cite the relevant conclusions from their final report:
>Ukraine’s airspace management
>a.	 The decision-making processes related to the use of Ukraine’s airspace was
dominated by the interests of military aviation
The initiative to restrict the airspace
over the eastern part of Ukraine below FL260 originated from the military
authorities
The objective of the measure was to protect military aeroplanes from
attacks from the ground and to separate military air traffic from civil aviation
The
Ukrainian authorities assumed that by taking this measure, civil aeroplanes flying
over the area above FL260 were automatically safe too
>b.	 The initiative to change the restriction to FL320 on 14 July 2014 came from civil air
traffic control
The underlying reason for this change remains unclear
>c.	 The NOTAMs did not contain any substantive reason for the altitude restrictions
Therefore, Ukraine did not act in accordance with the guidelines in ICAO Doc
9554-AN/932
>d.	 When implementing the above measures, the Ukrainian authorities took insufficient
notice of the possibility of a civil aeroplane at cruising altitude being fired upon
This was also the case, when, according to the Ukrainian authorities, the shooting-
down of an Antonov An-26 on 14 July 2014 and that of a Sukhoi Su-25 on 16 July
2014 occurred while these aeroplanes were flying at altitudes beyond the effective
range of MANPADS
The weapon systems mentioned by the Ukrainian authorities
in relation to the shooting down of these aircraft can pose a risk to civil aeroplanes,
because they are capable of reaching their cruising altitude
However, no measures
were taken to protect civil aeroplanes against these weapon systems
> modern Russia
To me, modern Russia begins with the fall of the Soviet Union
I don't see much reason or evidence to believe it was intentional
It was a Buk operated outside its battalion
It can operate independently, sure, but the capabilities of its radar system are quite poor, and it's probably not hard to make a mistake with target identification
Why would I care about what Americans feel
I find their general amount of patriotism unhealthy anyway
They could always claim that the BUK was captured from the Ukrainians
It's a much saner position then "the Ukrainians did it" and having a million of alternative versions
However, by now, it has already been established that the BUK is from Russia
That seems like an extremely simplistic view of Russia
Communist party members became the elite because everybody and their dog was a communist party member back then
The current president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaitė is a former communist party member, FFS
There are major changes to the country
It's considerably smaller than before, it's no longer a planned economy, communism is no longer a state ideology, pupils don't study works of Lenin and worship him anymore, Russians are free to travel abroad, religion's on the rise
And despite even the recent trend of increasing human rights violations and censorship, it is still way more liberal than the Soviet Union ever was
I do
I barely ever watch the Russian media as I simply can't stand it for longer than a couple of sentences
As far as I'm aware of, it is still "the Ukrainian army is to blame" and "the Russophobic investigation team dares to groundlessly blame Russia".
That's what you get when your twitter feed is curated by an embassador's teenage son

Yes, multiple different sources in two languages online
Being tracked regarding what
> worried their online behavior was being monitored
I'm not *worried*, I'm fully aware of it
It's no secret it's constantly monitored, see [SORM-2] The upcoming [Yarovaya law] will even require the provides to store *all traffic* for at least half a year (which is completely ridiculous from the technical point of view, but who cares)
I don't conceal having an anti-government stance
Well, considering that currently I can't even update my Linux distribution without using a proxy or VPN, and sometimes even Google Translate doesn't work, yes, the popularity of VPN is steadily going up
* Many opposition candidates have been barred from election to the Moscow City Duma
The protestors demand cancellation of the current elections and holding new elections, as well as resignation of the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin
* During previous protests against this decision, many people have been detained, and several people are being charged with "organizing riots" which can lead to prison terms
The protestors demand the closure of those criminal cases and immediate release of all political prisoners
Being a policeman is a conscious choice
Why
For example, Pyotr Verzilov was poisoned and didn't die
This photo is part of an Instagram story
This person was later on the same plane with Alexey and shot a video with Alexey moaning from pain
He posted a question "How much exclusive materials cost nowadays
" on Instagram, and added the following after the posted question:
>I understand its hype on another person's distress
I wish the quickest recovery for Alexey because he's a very important person for our country and we need him
But haters have already jumped on me and say that I'm trying to make profit from another person's distress
I'm not selling anything
I'm just curious how much such things can cost, I've never been involved in such things
I would like a source on that
I think a paper in a respected French journal like *Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France* or *Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences* should suffice
Is it the result from the embassy itself or the independent exit poll
Until Khrushchev came with his "Eliminating excesses in design and construction" order, which basically killed architecture in Russia
We still can't fully recover from the damages it dealt
They have metal detector frames at the entrance to this shopping mall
When I entered and saw this I though "fuck this" and turned back
Fortunately, this bullshit is not in Nizhny Novgorod yet
I'm not so sure about that
Whenever I come to Moscow from NN, I'm quite shocked by the drivers' behavior
I haven't tried driving in Moscow myself, though, maybe it would change my perception
Well, that was unexpected
I'm glad he's alive
Russia (and especially the Russian government) are also far too Americentric, so that's only matching
Well, OMON is part of militsiya, they are still colleagues
If such messages from other officers make at least some of them think about their actions, that's not in vain
It often works the opposite
When the dictator relies only on force, he becomes entirely dependent on people providing this force
And he doesn't really offer anything of value to them, as he has no public support and can't play the card "Those people hate you, but they love me, so you need me". Some generals might think "Why do we even need this guy
We can get the protestors beaten ourselves" and get rid of him
Yes, they are brutal because dealing with protesters is the main purpose of OMON, that's their job, and they are trained to do exactly that
They have genuine hatred towards all kinds of protesters
Ordinary police officers usually do something useful for the society
In Russia, OMON is not even the part of the police, but is a part of The National Guard which is basically Putin's personal internal army
Captain of the militsiya, platoon commander
Captain is the highest rank among junior officers
I don't think people are scared of them when nothing is going on at the moment
But when they are "in action", you need to be cautious, because they don't discriminate, they will often take random bystanders too
Also, when they are present at government-approved public events (they check people at the entrances, maintain order, etc), they are generally pretty nice, because that's also their job
I don't remember if I ever saw local OMON, actually
Maybe at some public events, as law enforcement
I live in Nizhny Novgorod, and we don't have much political activity going on here, and I can't remember OMON ever being brutal in my city
That's more of a Moscow thing, and I've never been to Moscow protests myself
Even when there is a rare unapproved event in Nizhny, local officers tend to be more polite and talkative rather than forceful, e.g. they just suggest you come with them instead of grabbing you
He literally is a "police captain" in Belarus, that's written in his officer ID
I don't know what it implies in other countries, but it is like that in Belarus (and Russia)
And no, he is not "just above street thug level". Junior officers ranks are considered fairly high
There are 10 ranks (various privates, sergeants, praporshchiks, and lieutenants) below captain in the Belarusian militsiya
Dispersing and relocating at the sight of the OMON when you're in a small group is one of the tactics used by the protestors in Belarus
Running in full gear (especially when it's hot) is not something pleasant
Because the police is the direct representation of the monopoly on violence by the state, they are only as good as the government system is
As long as there are necessary checks and balances in place, the police can remain the law enforcing force
When they fall into hands of an autocrat, they become the force of oppression
If Lukashenko falls, it seems pretty likely
This map is outdated somewhat
While the general speed limit on highways is 110, starting from 2019, it is now legally possible to raise it to 130 for some highways
For example, there is a part of the Moscow–St
Petersburg toll road with 130 km/h. So, in my opinion, the map should read 130
I should also mention that highways are almost non-existant outside Moscow and St
Petersburg and their surroundings, so the most common speed limit outside the cities is 90 km/h.
Also, there is no fine for going up to +20 above the limit, so effective limits are always 20 km/h higher
Thus everyone drives 80 *inside the cities*, where the general speed limit is 60, which is insane by European countries' standards with their most common 40 or 50 limits
I've once been in an old [Lada Niva] on the back seat without seatbelts at 110 km/h. And the car had the right front seat removed, so there was 2 meters of nothingness between me and the windshield
That was a terrifying experience
This thing has aerodynamical properties of a brick
>Wrong
Take M4 'Don' highway, FEx
(And also 130 at some parts)
I know
I said "almost". There are probably like 400 km of proper highways outside of Moscow/Moscow oblast' and SpB/Leningrad oblast'. We also have a short piece of a highway near Nizhny Novgorod (part of M7)
As a resident of NN, I use it occasionally, but most of the times I have to drive somewhere outside the city, there's no highway
And if you go the East from Nizhny Novgorod, what will you find
A small piece of M5 near Samara and a small piece of M5 near Chelyabinsk, I believe that's it
If you're a resident of Novosibirsk, Ekaterinburg, Omsk, you basically don't know what a highway is
That's what I've meant
>:)) try to do it in Moscow, St-Petersburg
but almost everywhere at a day time
I've meant parts with no traffic jams
I want to drive from Nizhny Novgorod to Belarus someday, but it seems pretty exhausting
Russian distances are hard
[Here's the full transcript] of Navanly's final speech for those who are interested
Well, the exact term doesn't really matter
Depending on the situation in the country, it'll either be cancelled at some point or extended indefinitely, as Putin can pull new criminal cases out of his ass every time if he wants
Lol, of course not
Why on Earth would they
Zyuganov (CPRF leader) accused Navalny of organizing a [colored revolution] in Russia
Zhirinovsky (LDPR leader) spent his entire speech during January 19 Duma opening session talking about Navalny, calling him a foreign agent, calling his supporters drug addicts and prostitutes, and demanding a real prison term for him
Russia is more authoritarian than totalitarian
China has a much greater role of the party, although Xi has been changing that and manifesting as a sole ruler, not just a representative of the party
It's actually one of the lighter variants of penitentiary facilities in Russia
There are the following levels:
* Colony-settlement
The lightest one, usually for lighter crimes committed by accident
There are no guards inside, you live in a dorm, your family can live with you, you can walk freely around the entire colony and even work outside it, wear whatever you want
* General regime colony (Navalny's case), the most common one, the overwhelming majority of prisoners are in facilities like this
You live in a dorm and your freedom is limited to the territory designated to your own squad
* Strict resume colony, only for men who are repeat offenders
Pretty similar to the previous one, but you get less visitations and so on
* Special regime colonies and prisons, only for men who have committed extremely heavy crimes, usually sentenced for life
People live there in a prison cell
>I don’t even know what we can sanction
[Navalny knows] The EU have recently implemented the [Magnitsky Act] allowing them to easily punish individuals
Use it
Many Putin's friends benefit from being able to freely operate in the European states
They buy assets in EU, they send their families to the EU, and they store their money in the EU
You have leverage
>Maybe expel all Russian diplomates from all Europe based consulates
Please not that
That will lead to Russia expelling all diplomats as a response, and ordinary Russians won't even be able to get a visa
As you asked in Russian, but this is an English-speaking forum, I'll answer in both languages
Кремль давно тратит довольно много усилий на пропаганду, в частности на демонизацию Навального. Им удалось убедить много кого, что Навальный агент Госдепа и западных спецслужб и пытается устроить цветную революцию в России, а также вор и преступник. И, надо сказать, сам Навальный своей риторикой или своими действиями тоже умеет отталкивать людей. Его не любят довольно много людей в России. Некоторые из таких комментариев также могут быть оставлены кремлеботами (я полагаю, аббревиатура [IRA] известна американцам по докладам о вмешательствах в выборы)
The Kremlin has been spending quite a lot of effort on propaganda, in particular on demonizing Navalny
They managed to convince many people that Navalny is an agent of the State Department and Western intelligence services and is trying to arrange a color revolution in Russia, and also is a thief and a criminal
And, to be fair, Navalny himself, with some of his rhetoric or his actions, also can alienate people
Quite a lot of people in Russia don't like him
Some of these comments may also be left by Kremlin bots (I believe the acronym [IRA]  is known to Americans from reports on election interference)
Some minor members of these parties here and there do express some opposition views
But all of the high-ranking members, including every single State Duma deputy, are completely loyal to Putin
Well, they might *act* (as in theater) as opposition parties to create an image of plurality when asked to, but they never contradict anything remotely significant
EDIT: I have to actually correct myself, as a Communist State Duma deputy [Valery Rashkin] today released [a video titled "We demand release of political prisoners"] He doesn't mention Navalny in this video, but the date might not be the coincidence, and he also widely discussed Navalny's video about Putin's palace last week and was fairly supportive of pro-Navalny protests
Сложно сказать. Это мнение как минимум значительной части населения, десятков процентов. Вполне возможно и большинства. Но есть значительная часть, тоже хотя бы десятки процентов, кто с этим не согласен.
Hard to tell
This is the opinion of at least a significant part of the population, tens of percent
Quite possibly the majority
But there is a significant portion, also at least tens of percent, who disagree with this
Grats
It's the Moscow [Aeroexpress] logo
A red star is associated with Moscow in Russia
And I don't think there's such a strong connotation with communism as, say, with hammer and sickle
This red train is exactly what you thought
>is the only country in the whole continent of Europe that can't access Schengen without visas
At least Russia and Belarus are there too, so not the only
> Crimeans were given Russian passports by Putin
However, people registered in Crimea are denied visas by many countries
For instance, Schengen countries agreed to refuse issuing visas in this case
But I've heard some countries (e.g., Greece) ignore this agreement
>Would you consider Russia as intending to join EU
I can't imagine that happening anytime soon
> Belarus want to be part of EU
Where do you get that
Belarus is probably the least European-integrated country out there, and they have been under EU sanctions for a long time already
No, they are supposed to use their Ukrainian passports
>have to lie about their place of residence
You can't lie about that
The address of your registration is explicitly written in the [Russian internal passport] and embassies take a scan copy of it
Changing it is not very easy if you have no connections in another region of Russia
Yeah, their president, Lukashenko, was even banned from entering the EU from 2006 to 2016
However, since 2014 and Ukraine events, he's somewhat distanced himself from Russia and become more friendly with the EU
As far as I understand, the main problem for Kosovo is that it's not even recognized by several EU members
I remember the movies and a SEGA game
They acquired the power to accurately judge other people's abilities by looking at their faces
Isn't it remarkable

Well, considering that currently I can't even update my Linux distribution without using a proxy or VPN, and sometimes even Google Translate doesn't work, yes, the popularity of VPN is steadily going up
* Many opposition candidates have been barred from election to the Moscow City Duma
The protestors demand cancellation of the current elections and holding new elections, as well as resignation of the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin
* During previous protests against this decision, many people have been detained, and several people are being charged with "organizing riots" which can lead to prison terms
The protestors demand the closure of those criminal cases and immediate release of all political prisoners
Being a policeman is a conscious choice
Why
For example, Pyotr Verzilov was poisoned and didn't die
This photo is part of an Instagram story
This person was later on the same plane with Alexey and shot a video with Alexey moaning from pain
He posted a question "How much exclusive materials cost nowadays
" on Instagram, and added the following after the posted question:
>I understand its hype on another person's distress
I wish the quickest recovery for Alexey because he's a very important person for our country and we need him
But haters have already jumped on me and say that I'm trying to make profit from another person's distress
I'm not selling anything
I'm just curious how much such things can cost, I've never been involved in such things
I would like a source on that
I think a paper in a respected French journal like *Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France* or *Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences* should suffice
Is it the result from the embassy itself or the independent exit poll
Until Khrushchev came with his "Eliminating excesses in design and construction" order, which basically killed architecture in Russia
We still can't fully recover from the damages it dealt
They have metal detector frames at the entrance to this shopping mall
When I entered and saw this I though "fuck this" and turned back
Fortunately, this bullshit is not in Nizhny Novgorod yet
I'm not so sure about that
Whenever I come to Moscow from NN, I'm quite shocked by the drivers' behavior
I haven't tried driving in Moscow myself, though, maybe it would change my perception
Well, that was unexpected
I'm glad he's alive
Russia (and especially the Russian government) are also far too Americentric, so that's only matching
Well, OMON is part of militsiya, they are still colleagues
If such messages from other officers make at least some of them think about their actions, that's not in vain
It often works the opposite
When the dictator relies only on force, he becomes entirely dependent on people providing this force
And he doesn't really offer anything of value to them, as he has no public support and can't play the card "Those people hate you, but they love me, so you need me". Some generals might think "Why do we even need this guy
We can get the protestors beaten ourselves" and get rid of him
Yes, they are brutal because dealing with protesters is the main purpose of OMON, that's their job, and they are trained to do exactly that
They have genuine hatred towards all kinds of protesters
Ordinary police officers usually do something useful for the society
In Russia, OMON is not even the part of the police, but is a part of The National Guard which is basically Putin's personal internal army
Captain of the militsiya, platoon commander
Captain is the highest rank among junior officers
I don't think people are scared of them when nothing is going on at the moment
But when they are "in action", you need to be cautious, because they don't discriminate, they will often take random bystanders too
Also, when they are present at government-approved public events (they check people at the entrances, maintain order, etc), they are generally pretty nice, because that's also their job
I don't remember if I ever saw local OMON, actually
Maybe at some public events, as law enforcement
I live in Nizhny Novgorod, and we don't have much political activity going on here, and I can't remember OMON ever being brutal in my city
That's more of a Moscow thing, and I've never been to Moscow protests myself
Even when there is a rare unapproved event in Nizhny, local officers tend to be more polite and talkative rather than forceful, e.g. they just suggest you come with them instead of grabbing you
He literally is a "police captain" in Belarus, that's written in his officer ID
I don't know what it implies in other countries, but it is like that in Belarus (and Russia)
And no, he is not "just above street thug level". Junior officers ranks are considered fairly high
There are 10 ranks (various privates, sergeants, praporshchiks, and lieutenants) below captain in the Belarusian militsiya
Dispersing and relocating at the sight of the OMON when you're in a small group is one of the tactics used by the protestors in Belarus
Running in full gear (especially when it's hot) is not something pleasant
Because the police is the direct representation of the monopoly on violence by the state, they are only as good as the government system is
As long as there are necessary checks and balances in place, the police can remain the law enforcing force
When they fall into hands of an autocrat, they become the force of oppression
If Lukashenko falls, it seems pretty likely
This map is outdated somewhat
While the general speed limit on highways is 110, starting from 2019, it is now legally possible to raise it to 130 for some highways
For example, there is a part of the Moscow–St
Petersburg toll road with 130 km/h. So, in my opinion, the map should read 130
I should also mention that highways are almost non-existant outside Moscow and St
Petersburg and their surroundings, so the most common speed limit outside the cities is 90 km/h.
Also, there is no fine for going up to +20 above the limit, so effective limits are always 20 km/h higher
Thus everyone drives 80 *inside the cities*, where the general speed limit is 60, which is insane by European countries' standards with their most common 40 or 50 limits
I've once been in an old [Lada Niva] on the back seat without seatbelts at 110 km/h. And the car had the right front seat removed, so there was 2 meters of nothingness between me and the windshield
That was a terrifying experience
This thing has aerodynamical properties of a brick
>Wrong
Take M4 'Don' highway, FEx
(And also 130 at some parts)
I know
I said "almost". There are probably like 400 km of proper highways outside of Moscow/Moscow oblast' and SpB/Leningrad oblast'. We also have a short piece of a highway near Nizhny Novgorod (part of M7)
As a resident of NN, I use it occasionally, but most of the times I have to drive somewhere outside the city, there's no highway
And if you go the East from Nizhny Novgorod, what will you find
A small piece of M5 near Samara and a small piece of M5 near Chelyabinsk, I believe that's it
If you're a resident of Novosibirsk, Ekaterinburg, Omsk, you basically don't know what a highway is
That's what I've meant
>:)) try to do it in Moscow, St-Petersburg
but almost everywhere at a day time
I've meant parts with no traffic jams
I want to drive from Nizhny Novgorod to Belarus someday, but it seems pretty exhausting
Russian distances are hard
[Here's the full transcript] of Navanly's final speech for those who are interested
Well, the exact term doesn't really matter
Depending on the situation in the country, it'll either be cancelled at some point or extended indefinitely, as Putin can pull new criminal cases out of his ass every time if he wants
Lol, of course not
Why on Earth would they
Zyuganov (CPRF leader) accused Navalny of organizing a [colored revolution] in Russia
Zhirinovsky (LDPR leader) spent his entire speech during January 19 Duma opening session talking about Navalny, calling him a foreign agent, calling his supporters drug addicts and prostitutes, and demanding a real prison term for him
Russia is more authoritarian than totalitarian
China has a much greater role of the party, although Xi has been changing that and manifesting as a sole ruler, not just a representative of the party
It's actually one of the lighter variants of penitentiary facilities in Russia
There are the following levels:
* Colony-settlement
The lightest one, usually for lighter crimes committed by accident
There are no guards inside, you live in a dorm, your family can live with you, you can walk freely around the entire colony and even work outside it, wear whatever you want
* General regime colony (Navalny's case), the most common one, the overwhelming majority of prisoners are in facilities like this
You live in a dorm and your freedom is limited to the territory designated to your own squad
* Strict resume colony, only for men who are repeat offenders
Pretty similar to the previous one, but you get less visitations and so on
* Special regime colonies and prisons, only for men who have committed extremely heavy crimes, usually sentenced for life
People live there in a prison cell
>I don’t even know what we can sanction
[Navalny knows] The EU have recently implemented the [Magnitsky Act] allowing them to easily punish individuals
Use it
Many Putin's friends benefit from being able to freely operate in the European states
They buy assets in EU, they send their families to the EU, and they store their money in the EU
You have leverage
>Maybe expel all Russian diplomates from all Europe based consulates
Please not that
That will lead to Russia expelling all diplomats as a response, and ordinary Russians won't even be able to get a visa
As you asked in Russian, but this is an English-speaking forum, I'll answer in both languages
Кремль давно тратит довольно много усилий на пропаганду, в частности на демонизацию Навального. Им удалось убедить много кого, что Навальный агент Госдепа и западных спецслужб и пытается устроить цветную революцию в России, а также вор и преступник. И, надо сказать, сам Навальный своей риторикой или своими действиями тоже умеет отталкивать людей. Его не любят довольно много людей в России. Некоторые из таких комментариев также могут быть оставлены кремлеботами (я полагаю, аббревиатура [IRA] известна американцам по докладам о вмешательствах в выборы)
The Kremlin has been spending quite a lot of effort on propaganda, in particular on demonizing Navalny
They managed to convince many people that Navalny is an agent of the State Department and Western intelligence services and is trying to arrange a color revolution in Russia, and also is a thief and a criminal
And, to be fair, Navalny himself, with some of his rhetoric or his actions, also can alienate people
Quite a lot of people in Russia don't like him
Some of these comments may also be left by Kremlin bots (I believe the acronym [IRA]  is known to Americans from reports on election interference)
Some minor members of these parties here and there do express some opposition views
But all of the high-ranking members, including every single State Duma deputy, are completely loyal to Putin
Well, they might *act* (as in theater) as opposition parties to create an image of plurality when asked to, but they never contradict anything remotely significant
EDIT: I have to actually correct myself, as a Communist State Duma deputy [Valery Rashkin] today released [a video titled "We demand release of political prisoners"] He doesn't mention Navalny in this video, but the date might not be the coincidence, and he also widely discussed Navalny's video about Putin's palace last week and was fairly supportive of pro-Navalny protests
Сложно сказать. Это мнение как минимум значительной части населения, десятков процентов. Вполне возможно и большинства. Но есть значительная часть, тоже хотя бы десятки процентов, кто с этим не согласен.
Hard to tell
This is the opinion of at least a significant part of the population, tens of percent
Quite possibly the majority
But there is a significant portion, also at least tens of percent, who disagree with this
Grats
It's the Moscow [Aeroexpress] logo
A red star is associated with Moscow in Russia
And I don't think there's such a strong connotation with communism as, say, with hammer and sickle
This red train is exactly what you thought
>is the only country in the whole continent of Europe that can't access Schengen without visas
At least Russia and Belarus are there too, so not the only
> Crimeans were given Russian passports by Putin
However, people registered in Crimea are denied visas by many countries
For instance, Schengen countries agreed to refuse issuing visas in this case
But I've heard some countries (e.g., Greece) ignore this agreement
>Would you consider Russia as intending to join EU
I can't imagine that happening anytime soon
> Belarus want to be part of EU
Where do you get that
Belarus is probably the least European-integrated country out there, and they have been under EU sanctions for a long time already
No, they are supposed to use their Ukrainian passports
>have to lie about their place of residence
You can't lie about that
The address of your registration is explicitly written in the [Russian internal passport] and embassies take a scan copy of it
Changing it is not very easy if you have no connections in another region of Russia
Yeah, their president, Lukashenko, was even banned from entering the EU from 2006 to 2016
However, since 2014 and Ukraine events, he's somewhat distanced himself from Russia and become more friendly with the EU
As far as I understand, the main problem for Kosovo is that it's not even recognized by several EU members
I remember the movies and a SEGA game
