I'd pick finland or sweden just so scandinavia won't look like a two head cumming cock and balls
That's just a big brain move
Reading all the people here complaining that their capital cities are ugly and unpleasant to live in makes me sad
*sad Manila noises*
Was once part of Spain's department
Then USA pirated us
Now freelancing, looking for domestic work in your boss's household, probably too busy texting friends and doing nonsense stuff in social media
Maria Guadalupe, Fernanda, Belinda, Anatalia, Saturnina, Anuncia
Can I be brother of Finland as well
Celebrating Christmas in freaking September
We don't celebrate Halloween so yeah
Why not
Obligatory not European but here in the Philippines, we also have synonyms and near-synonyms originating from different languages/language families
For example, “upuan” (Tagalog) and “silya” (from Spanish “silla”) both mean “chair”, “hinto” (Tagalog) and “para” (Spanish “parar”) both mean stop, “watawat” (Tagalog) and “bandila” (Spanish “bandera”) both mean flag, “maari” (Tagalog) and “puwede” (Spanish “puede”) both mean “may [I/we/etc
]”, and so on
Of course, being a bilingual country with English co-official with Filipino, we sometimes address these terms simply by their English equivalents themselves
Also, Filipinos have a near-universal aversion to using Tagalog/Filipino numbers, with most of us almost-exclusively preferring the Spanish or English version instead, depending on the context
Not European but a filipino that doesn't like kareoke
It is a requirement here even if your forced to do it
Impossible
Sabi ni Kap OK lang daw basta hangang alasonese lang
We need a Hitler against people who don't like fries
Is there a way to decline politely
I’m someone who never drinks alcohol and I certainly wouldn’t wish to offend locals who would offer me one
So that’s where we got it from
Lol
What about Switzerland
You must feel some sort of brotherly vibes considering they speak German or some version of it
So Finland is basically Kylo Ren
Maybe I can convince you to add a sun and three stars on it
I am not sure for I'm not Hungarian, but I think it is pronounced like 'fries' without the 'r'. Something like 'fais'.
>Spongebob has a distinct northern/Zagreb style of speaking
>...and Mr Krabs has an infamous Dalmatian islander accent and vocabulary, that group is most often stereotyped as being greedy in Croatian jokes
So that means Spongebob speaks in Kajkavian and Mr
Krabs speaks in Chakavian
That's interesting
And speaking of accents/dialects, what does Patrick's accent sound like
An über-hickish Bosnian/Herzegovian Croat accent (or whatever accent that's perceived as dumb in Croatia, I guess)
And what about Sandy's? Does she speak with a stereotypical ***'MURICAN*** accent
Beautiful is the most beautiful word in English, a European language
r/hydrohomies

I’ve been to Europe, it’s definitely Finnish
I go to a semi-private school, so this does not reflect the general school schedule in my country
Our classes usually start at 7:00 AM and go throughout the day without breaks until 1:00 PM
We are free for the rest of the day
Can't wait to visit Sweetden
yes
we play in the thunderstorms
Troll Hunter
It's norwegian i believe
I'd give you a silver if I had the money to
I think the phenomenon is called code-switching, and it’s definitely prevalent as hell here in the Philippines
It’s at a point where about a quarter of the words in casual conversations are in English
I enjoyed Wieliczka Salt Mine in Krakow because it's the first salt mine I have ever been to
It was full of historical facts and stuff as well
That and the Wawel Royal Castle
Not European but I used to think the Europe only consisted of England, France and Italy
I also used to think that Europe was full of witches and Wizards
Yeah it was
I'd like to know if the average Spanish knows about their country's past affairs in Asia
If I remember correctly, this was only mentioned in passing in our textbooks except for the writers
I have no idea about them
The past runs deep even in my own blood
Both of my parents have Spanish colonial ancestors despite my physique telling otherwise
Two of my grandparents though have European features and my spouse can be easily mistaken for one as well
Anyway, here's what I have to say
Regarding the differences in historical perspectives, I can't tell much as I haven't encountered a Spanish telling me how the history is from their perspective
What I can share is rather cultural
As part of our elementary education, we were taught about the traditional art and culture of our people
Those predating the colonial period were somewhat categorized as "tribal" or "indigenous
" Then we have the "real" traditional arts like dancing and music
We were shown videos and actual presentations of said traditional arts
We were told that it was *somehow* influenced by the Spanish
What shattered my previous notions of our very "own" Filipino traditional arts is when I was in Madrid's Plaza Mayor
There was a day of celebration happening in the city
I forgot which one and if it's a national celebration as well
There was a stage set up, showcasing traditional Spanish dance and music
It has an uncanny resemblance to what I know as traditional Filipino dance and music
It wasn't "somehow" influenced, it was IMPORTED
Music and art aside, a lot of Filipino languages are heavily influenced by Spanish
We even have a Spanish creole
What's funny is when I tried learning Spanish
I discovered that a lot of our "Spanish" surnames are quite funny
I had a professor *Equipaje* (luggage)
A classmate with a surname of *Los Baños* (the bathrooms) It's also a nice place with a lot of hot springs
Someone with *Cubeta* (bucket) or toilet bowl in Filipino
And a poor nobody during the colonial times who could not afford to buy a nice Spanish surname got a Filipino Tagalog one *[Bagongahasa] (newly raped)
Surnames aside, the three Catholic institutions (2 Italian, 1 Spanish) that provided my education never mentioned Spain weaponizing the Roman Catholic religion against the pagan savages of Asia and the Americas
This led to our society being pacified and disciplined by religion- the fear of God and the fear of eternal damnation, which still holds true today
Because of this, we still don't have abortion and divorce as basic rights
To summarize the Philippine history, you could say that we were in a Spanish Catholic convent for more than three hundred years, bought by the US for a few pieces of gold, suddenly raped by Imperial Japan for a bit, then bombed to dust by the US which "freed" us from imperialism
Then they taught us English, rock and roll, and diabetes (ice cream and soda)
This is Puss_Fondue and thanks for listening to my TED talk
It's only coming to light very recently that the president you mentioned betrayed a lot of his compatriots
He even ordered the assassination of his best general after admittedly assassinating a very famous revolutionary leader
If you're inclined to know more, see the film [Heneral Luna]
I'd rather welcome the Victorian overlords rather than the Spanish friars
I'd choo- choose the trains instead of the churches haha
Right when the US and Spain were about to make a deal, revolution was already brewing in the colony
This part in our history was never really taught properly in school
It was oversimplified and glorified
We were taught that we kicked out Spain
Then the Americans came
We weren't taught that we were simply handed over to the US
4th of July was our "independence" day back then
Such a coincidence that it's also the same with the US
The British did come to Manila but it was just a few short years
The US was the one who taught us English
If I remember correctly, there was a ship from the US full of teachers and doctors and would jumpstart our public education and healthcare
Spanish was reserved only for the aristocracy who could afford education during the colonial times
Thus, only a few can speak the language
On modern times, Spanish is now only taught as an elective and the number of schools offering it are diminishing
You're welcome and thanks for the shiny thing kind stranger
If you're ever in Manila, hit me up and I'll buy you a beer
And probably force you to have a stroopwafel from Starbucks
That's a fresh perspective for ne
>Dutch rebellion with the 'heretical Protestants'
This brought a painting from the Rijksmuseum to my mind: Fishing for Souls
I had fun looking at the faces of people on the Catholic side
>an entity that is more responsible for religiously inspired state-violence
I want this so bad in our history textbooks
I think the mere thought of it being ingrained in our society would drive us into true and full secularism
Someone who died recently was put to jail while still alive by our supreme court for "[offending religious feelings] This was in 2018
Same
I strangely want to learn more about the difference of a communist and a Russian communist
They could have been related to high-ranking officials and/or were very wealthy
Of course wealthy people in North Korea exist
You think Kim Jong-un’s henchmen would operate solely because of patriotism or ideology
That’s a very ignorant take on how North Korea works
There are enough opportunists and greedy people in the country that Kim Jong-un doesn’t need to hold people at gunpoint to find loyal officials
High-ranking officials and the upper class aren’t victims of the regime, they’re collaborators
China
Winged hussars
What is the most unique trait that sets you apart from other European countries
Putang Ina Mo
(I'm not fluent in tagalog
Lol)
“Mahal kita” (Filipino)
“Gihigugma tika” (Cebuano, though it’s very archaic and people nowdays mostly say “love you”)
What about :flag-czyszczykiewicz: ?
Should I be curious or afraid
In an igloo
Chocolates, football players, ethnic politics, DJ Mbenga
Brussels,Waffles,Chocolate
"wall demon" I mean their not wrong
Not to self I f ever I visit Czechia avoid windows
That's metal af
How were you guys taught about Indonesia
Honest question
Singapore made itself rich (or, more specifically, Lee Kuan Yew made his domain rich)
Hong Kong was ruled long after the decolonization period ended
One of the things that stuck with me from the shitshow that was Emily in Paris was the “explanation” as to why vagina is masculine in French: “It’s something a woman owns but a man possesses
Need someone to talk about it
WTF, was the welsh language made by a drunk guy
Doesn't Rugby have a large following in the UK and Ireland
Not sure about riots but it's definitely popular with Anglo expats here in the Middle East
This could just be one big hetalia episode
Yeah I guess
But I don't know why my 2 am self just imagined this in the form of hetalia characters
Can I apply as a Viking prisoner/captive/slave and still get those benefits
Before Spain came
Im not sure if it's there or not, but there's an IKEA here in Pasay City, near the Capital, Manila
I am envious of this
Apparently our current administration is too busy attacking critics, opposition, and the few remaining hallmarks of democracy that we have
Even the polandball facebook group was overrun by nationalist turks a week ago
I wonder what Biden's last name is, it's a mystery
I always wanted to move out (im from asia ) and i have decided to migrate to Germany too
Im still young (20F) but i think i am sure, i am thinking of studying there for a year first on exchange when COVID ends and check out how life would be
How was the process of becoming a citizen
I always looked it up on Google but I think talking to you guys here would be better  hope you can answer
Thank you
Danke
I appreciate you so much for replying to this comment of mine
I’ll shoot you a message, I’m going to try to gather up my thoughts first
Thank you
And congratulations again on getting that citizenship
Hope to visit soon
How do I (no data)
I would be celebrating if I were a Croatian lol
I hope to visit Finland someday :)
Stupid ranking system
If you have 3 people in joint second then the next one is 5th not 3rd
Why
UK is in 6th place but has 19 countries ahead of it
Looks like the ATLA intro
The coldest weather I've ever been in was 16C. It gave me a headache
I am going to go take a hot shower now all this talk about cold weather has got me shivering
what flag is malfoy
Oh look the two biggest lakes in the world - the Belarusian and the Moldavian
Here comes papa Spain and nobody'll bat an eye
Good for Poland
We'll just adapt as a species like, I don't know, the last several billion years
Let climate change run its course, and we would probably have evolved by then to adapt to harsher climates
Better Swiss than Swede
The rape capital of Europe is not that nice if you ask me
Switzerland is better than the rape capital of Europe
LOL
Austria is better than that country which love rape
Makes sense if we think of it as a divorce
Open the country
Stop having it be closed
I'd pick finland or sweden just so scandinavia won't look like a two head cumming cock and balls
That's just a big brain move
