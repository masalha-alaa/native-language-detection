How we left behind West Sahara and Equatorial Guinea people in the 70s, who spoke Spanish and held Spanish IDs at the time
I’m not very familiar with the root causes and would like to read more about it though
Political turmoil caused by the imminent Franco’s death played a major role though
It became a tradition among some people here to bring in West Sahara children over for summer holidays every year
Nowadays (40 years after the dictatorship ended) there are still way over 100
000 missing people in Spain who have been murdered by Franco's regime, and they are presumed to be buried in mass graves all around the country
Some corpses have been recovered over the years, but the great majority hasn't even though we actually know where many of these mass graves are
Some families don't even know where their relatives are to this day
I came to say the same
It still happened at least 1990
My friend is still trying to find his youngest sister
this is a known fact in spain, usually used to show how tolerant is spain with its regions compared to france
Most of them dissapeared while Franco ruled , they were  actually murdered for opposing his views . They usually kidnapped them , shot them and then buried them on the side of a road
I wish more people found this to be horrifying here in Spain
Sadly, some (right wing) people do not want to discuss this issue and criticise those who do, saying that they "live in the past" or "are only looking for revenge" when they just want to properly bury their loved ones before they die themselves
We still have a long way to go to reject and recover from the dictatorship 40 years later, and in my opinion there's no way we are doing that when people's relatives are literally still burried in ditches
i didnt know about this topic
Wait, so you don't let Zeus and the olympians decide on legal matters
Who ??
As far as I know, the francoists took the children of poor families, many suspected of being sympathetic to the anti-fascist cause, so that rich people (who were fascists 99
9% of the time) could raise them
I wouldn't be surprised if it was a common way of silencing dissent in the long run used in other dictatorships
I think it was more of a "guys, we got enough shit in our plate here" and Morocco saw the opportunity to put pressure on West Sahara (see the famous [Green March] so we just packed our shit and left them there
It is one of the many reasons we have *complicated* relations with Morocco to this very day
> abertzale
Means patriot in basque for anyone interested
Not really
*yet*
They're trying pretty hard though
Felipe González, our third president in democracy
He did it to fought ETA
Those islands are ok, don’t care about them, but Ceuta and Melilla are not colonies but an integral part of Spain that happen to be in the North African coast
When they compare with Gibraltar is just ridiculous
You have to go nearly 700 (years) back to find some kind of settlement there from the Berber, and not even any kind of Moroccan Kingdom existed so their claims are certainly thinly based
Not Moroccans, their kingdom didn't exist yet
It was the Almoravid and Almohad empires (of berber origin, I think)
Yep
It’s like saying that French Guiana must be part of Brazil just because they happen to be touching
Well, that's just hammering my point in
True, I dont know why morrocans would have any opinion on It , It makes more sense for the middle east to claim it
It's interesting how still it's addressed as a "reconquest"
Haha, I would like Portugal and Spain to join, so yes
I mean, one doesn't reconquest a city founded by the "occupiers" who happen to be living in some territory for centuries, what I'm trying to say is that the reconquista is one of those cases where history has been manipulated to follow a specific vision
People live in a place, invaders conquer and settle, the ones in the north start to make them flinch and claim the territories they had + new things built
I still see this as a reconquest
It's obvious that every win is manipulated to make it look bigger but everything has a logical base
The creation of new cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different
I don't understand why you say "It's interesting how still it's addressed as a reconquest ". Mate, are you wondering why the 700-year-old period we study known as **the Reconquista** is addressed like that
700 years, that's longer that the people that were living in the peninsula before (Visigoths, 300 years), how can you reconquer a place that didn't exist before
"New cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different" that is extremely vague, are you trying to compare an empty land to a city where people and culture developed
The reconquista is tried to be sold by some people of an "us against them" type of thing, and build over it a nationalist story of Spain for some reason
So you are telling me that the lands didn't exist before
When you conquer you don't need to have cities, you need to have the lands, settlements can develop through time
And what do you wanna prove with 700 years being bigger than 300
(If you don't want to consider the conquerors as Visigoth heirs) The battle was bigger than the initial stay, and
"New cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different" is extremely vague because it is just that
The creation of a village won't change anything, the lands of the ancestors are still those, because someone is staying there doesn't mean anything
I don't know why you focus on that point
You talk as if there were no other cities in the whole peninsula that weren't Al-Andalus
The reconquista is tried to be sold as "us against them" because the winners fought invaders and then united under a kingdom to **form SPAIN**. It is not hard to understand
You honestly seem to hate Spain
Speaking of culture, the Spanish-Muslim art of non-belligerent is quite interesting, I recommend everyone to take a look at it
No where I state lands didn't exist before, that's just a dumb idea that has nothing to do with what I said, cities made culture flourish, a culture that was much more rooted than the Visigoths (that's why I mentioned the 700 hundred years, much bigger impact), I'm not saying no other cities existed, what I'm trying to say is that yes, they invaded and conquered a new land and settled there, created a culture, entrenchment, and then the same thing happened again, there was a conquest, that's how things happened over and over, not that romantization of "multiple kingdoms joining to regain what's "theirs"? Why did it belong to them
, By the way, Spain as a country wasn't created until years later, that's what I'm referring to as why "the reconquista" has been manipulated for ideological reasons
"You honestly seem to hate Spain"-> This is plain stupid, because I don't buy the heroic tale some people try to tell as to how Spain was "formed"?, that doesn't equal "hate", is only trying to understand better history, trying to not fall under bias which is really difficult
the fun part is later some people in this country get surprised why some seek independence
I’d say that it’s called The Reconquista because muslims conquered christian lands, and then christians retook them
But I guess your point is that it has been fairytalisized too much, and that it’s much more complex than just a long war
I mean, if we are going to be assholes anyway, I won’t *obliterate* a country; I’d rather drain Doggerland in its entirety
The UK thinks it’s so special because it’s an island
Welcome to the continent bish
France loves it’s northern sea
What sea
The Netherlands is a seafaring maritime power
How tragic that they’re now *landlocked* :P
Portugal, just so we get 1200km of coastline for drunk tourists
Luxembourg
No hard feelings, just chose the smallest country
If we end the UK would Gibraltar go down with them or would it still exist
France
If you've ever lived in a touristic part of Spain you'd know why
Spain
But please, allows us all to relocate first
It’s not our fault that our politicians are clowns
Portugal, just to unlandlock Extremadura and León.
Portugal
What about Andorra
I'm sure that many people here don't know where Andorra is
I think spanish people wouldnt have a problem living with our fellow portuguese friends
As long as they hate the french, we are fine with it
Isla Ibérica has a nice ring to it
Everyone in Galiza kinda knows how to communicate with portuguese people so that sounds good
What if you get Hans Island
Everybody is an organ donor by default, unless you declare yourself otherwise
So we used our natural lazyness for the greater good
Don’t know if related, but they’ve repeatedly tried to sell me drugs both in Porto and in Lisbon every time I’ve gone
Even when my family was right beside me
Portugal is the only country in the EU where I’ve seen so many people doing this
Had to check Twitter to verify it because it finally happened
The nth addition to the UK being a joke since 2016
As Spanish living and working in London for a financial company I've been suggested if I like Vancouver in Canada or Frankfurt in Germany
I think I'm going to try Vancouver
Apart from that, I don't know what to do with my GBP savings, I think I'm going to convert it to CAD or EUR once I know if they can send me to Vancouver (to Frankfurt is easy, is EU)
Why does he look like a bootleg Trump
You can use our balconies if you want, because you're quite fucked
As Spanish, I don't really think I like him, he has used us as anti-europe propaganda
we don't like  unprovoked attacks like that, what's more, it was a lie
>That's incredibly depressin
i used to think your democrazy was the bes working one in europe
then the referendum happened
Sorry my English doesn't go that far, what is "rad"?
No, oc not
It just seemed like the whole brexit campaign was based on lies
Targeting peoples feelings, blaming europe for things it didn't do
A campaign based on feelings, not facts
Maybe i'm wrong tho
In the end i didn't live it
Sorry if i said something that bothered you, i didn't mean to
That time Napoleon said “Hey guys
We are friends right
I want to invade Portugal, can my soldiers go across Spain to get there
” and we said yes and Napoleon proceeded to invade us instead
Classic French
Never trust a baguette
In adittion to the classic Napoleon invasion, La armada invencible (Spanish Armada) and his sinking was a funny one
Absolutely true
Let's not forget Godoy inside a carpet trying to hide from a revolution
ThE mAiNe WaS aN iNsIdE jOb
Ugly "soviet" style building with green canopy and pot in some tiny balconies
Unemployed or working in black
That's city poverty, rural one is different
Spain
There's a noticeable percentage of people living in true 3rd world conditions, but usually it's pocket communities made up of minorities, immigrants and chronically poor families
They live in "slums" like Cañada real
Still a shame for a country like ours
Then, we have a sizable amount of our population living in relative poverty
Usually in bad/low class neighborhood hit hard by deindustrialization in concrete or brick prefab low quality blocks built during the dictatorship or shortly after, where often 3 generations share a flat
They might not starve, and have access to TV and healthcare and education, but barely get by and face discrimination in many ways
Their children perform poorly at school and the system sinks them down
Lack of education leads to poor health habits and mental and physical illness
Not as much as in the 80s and 90s, but man do we have a problem with drugs
They have it very difficult to find liveable jobs (Spanish job market is utter crap for everybody, imagine for them), as much as it is criticised as oversized, our welfare is minimum compared to most European countries
Administration is very inefficient as well, and they are usually left behind
Many families live off the grandparents' pension
Then we have the "new poor", people that even working a "good" job and having support of family and friends still struggle to make ends meet
Happens more and more in the biggest cities with wages stagnant and rents skyrocketing
A junior engineer earning minimum wage is not unheard of at all
Minimum wage is 1000eur before taxes and social security
A flat deemed decent in Madrid is like 600-900
But needless to say, many work a full time job on a temporary contract, making barely that while the company tricks the state
[This] is officially the poorest neighborhood in Spain
The average salary is maximum 5k / year
Spanish perspective: you live in an old building, painting falling off the walls and ceiling
You and your whole family (if you have any) do any work you can find, without a contract of course because you can’t let the government take part of the 20€ that they gave you for picking strawberries last weekend
And if you have any accidents, they’ll leave you at the side of the road alone for you to find your way home, and deny that you ever worked for or with them
Your neighborhood is bad
Bad as in other people will do the impossible to avoid walking through it and even though you’re most likely used to it you’ll still fake having a knife in your pocket while walking (or even maybe have a real one who knows)
You’re also most likely not racist because you’ve been raised with families who were like yours and didn’t care about colour or nationality as long as you lived next to them and could play football together
There’s probably more but that’s all I can recollect
Not sure if in english they use "working in black". I think they use more "working under the table".
But ya, I would say poverty in Spain would be people working under the table while getting help of the local and national goverment, so not that bad
There is also this gipsy areas where they live in chabolas (shanty towns) and there is a lot of poverty too
Thanks for the correction, I wasn't really sure about being correct, but I didn't had time to look it up
Not for the common person in Spain
You could perfectly live without needing to speak a word of any other language but Spanish
Yep, every time I try to speak Valencian I end up mixing it with English
As a spanish living in catalonia i dont use spanish outside school, and didnt go to school for 4 months and now i feel like a shit typing in spanish
Not worse but more sluggish
Some words come to mind in english
And It happens quite a lot
I thinks it's because i consume more media in english than spanish
For one i almost exclusively write in english
I'm the opposite- I speak Spanish so much that my English is going to shit
Yeah, kinda
I mostly consume English media, and I go around on primarily English websites like this one
I often forget the Spanish translation for an English word in my head, so if I know my interlocutor will understand me I just say it in english
I do try to say it with a huge accent to make sure they understand me, and also bc it feels kinda dumb to suddenly start speaking with another accent mid sentence
I speak both languages fluently
There have been times in my life where I spoke one much better than the other
Right now I work in English (mostly) and speak English with my family at home, so my Spanish is slowly degrading
When I was a teen I spent most of my time speaking Spanish with friends and my English was much worse
As a spanish living in catalonia i dont use spanish outside school, and didnt go to school for 4 months and now i feel like a shit typing in spanish
Yes, I live in an English speaking country and I use Spanish less than an hour per week, most weeks
I can notice sometimes struggling to find the correct Spanish word or friends laughing because I fell for a “reverse false friend”
Well, the common person in Spain would have to know some English first
In Spain we have a very thick accent
Many of the sounds english have just don't exist in Spanish and they seem to vary a lot and pronuntiation looks random
we have an accent, but everyone has
I don't mind at all
And tbh I've  found that native english speakers care very little about it too
I don't like it, I think that all romance speaking countries are ashamed of their English accents, we usually have very notorious accents and we are not very good at English in general, so there's always some degree of shame when talking English
No, I don't, hadn't spoken English in my whole Life so my accent is as thick as t gets
Funny thing is I am Spanish but been in the US for five years studying
People in the US notice my accent right away but they are unable to tell were is from I studied in the south so I have picked up some slang words and different pronunciation
Last year I went to the UK for vacation and some of the people I interacted with kept asking me if I was American because of my accent which it confused me for a minute as I always thought I had a really strong accent but no where near American as some Americans had pointed out my accent themselves and never recognized it as one of their own
Some in the south think I’m from the north due to my accent, which is funny because I am from the north just not in their country
But in resumen I do like my accent
I don't mind it but people usually like it and fund it funny
I think it happens the same to all Spanish people
I am from Spain and no, I do not like it I would like to improve it with time
I dislike my accent, not because I have an Spanish accent but because I have some sort of weird Irish-English-US accent and people either think I’m an idiot for “trying too hard” or think I’m faking it
About the accent itself
I do like it, sounds great
Just to let you German people know, us natives love your accent
It's beautiful and you shouldn't be ashamed of it
Agreed
I'm an English Philologist, I work for an American company and, therefore, I use English daily to speak with customers and colleagues
I've studied abroad and 90% of the movies, TV shows, and videogames I watch and play are in English
But my Spanish accent will never disappear
I did a presentation in English last year in Paris and two different people came to me later and said "You're Spanish, right
Your accent gave you away" :(
Every speaker, native or otherwise will have an accent
Don't say that
I fucking love the dutch accent, when it has like an american touch to it
Maybe I'm weird
Greek sounds a lot like Spanish
Five vowels (I mean, there are only five letters, what was the problem with that, french/English people
) and a lot of consonants sound similar, even our strong R
I've met/worked many Greeks and Cypriot (from the Greek part) abroad that at first I though they were Spaniards because of the accent
I love it
It's kinda thick imo
We don't have as many vowels as you do so we struggle with that
I think this only happens in europe tho
Since english is just another language but we all use english to comunicate, the general agreement is that we won't give a single fuck about accents
But in latin america you see spanish speakers working very hard to ha e a perfect american accent
Down there having a good accent is important, here in europe we just agreed we don't care haha
The usual things are: inability to roll "Rs", inability to pronounce the z sound and more on a grammar topic you struggle so much with the verb tenses and conjugation (understandably since english grammar is so easy)
So basically the verbs and the r thing since the zzzz thing is not an all spanish thing
But the thing is I think spanish people are very generous and kind in that regard
If you say in the most broken spanish "hhhola, donde estar la museou de las artes" absolutely everyone will understand you because spanish pronuntiation and grammatical rules are perfectly defined by the rae
On top of what the other guy said:
"Making up" vowels
Our vowels are very simple, there's 5 of them and they're written as they sound
In English you have a myriad of vowels, of single letter vowels turning into two sounds (m**a**te), silent vowels (mat**e**), double vowerls turning into one sound (t**ou**gh), letters having multiple different possible sounds depending on the word
If you apply these rules to Spanish you mess it up immensely
It's much more simple than that
Realizing certain consonants like t or p with a puff of air is something really common as well and it sounds terrible
We don't have that puff of air in any word, so instead of saying your ts like "table" say it like "actor". Same for p, b, c/k...
For Spain's Spanish, please stick to one pronounciation of c/z: if you choose to pronounce c/z like th or like s then do it consistently but don't mix it up
I get so triggered when English speakers pronounce Zaragoza as Tharagosa
It's either Tharagotha or Saragosa, but stick to one
Also if you choose to pronounce it as an s, then it's an s, not an English buzzing z. We don't have that sound
English has such weird phonetics that virtually arguably any language with English accent sounds bad, and viceversa
I really don't know if i'd categorized that accent as spanish
She seems to have a sputh american spanish accent (maybe venezuela or colombia)
I'd say spanish accent (from spain) is different
It's one of those things that we don't understand
Stupid and estupid are the same hahah
That's what happens in Brussels where everybody is from a different country and no-one gives a crap
People just don't make an effort to lose the accent, it's beautiful that feeling of mutual respect and understanding
The puss in boots is a "forced" andalusian accent
Antonio banderas is from Málaga and he used a very strong accent from there
But yeah somethung like that
Very similar
But yes
But for some reason many don't use it
It's a hard sound to pronounce for some reason, even many British people replace "th" sounds with "f" while speaking English
When I first moved to the UK I didn't know if they were saying " Thursday" or " Fist day"
I think it's cool
An exagerated zorro like puss in boot was the funnier option
I lived in England for a couple of years and I was judged quite often for having an accent even though most people would ask me about where I was from since I don't have a distinctive Spanish accent
I appreciate your feeling but regretfully it is very common
yeh
the "I fink" and the avoiding to pronounce t's (wah uh boh uhl instead of water bottle) drive me nuts
In German there is a word called "Preis-Leistungsverhältnis" which is price-performance discrepancy
I think a lot of people feel like Apple don't deliver enough value for the price they have
Also in my mind 30% of the price is the branding alone
You can't get them easily fixed or it will cost you an arm and a leg, which is another downside
Everything that is being said here can be applied to Spain but, in addition, in recent years I have also noticed that people like to boast about getting a phone that they consider a bargain
For example, I've seen many people brag about their Xiaomi that has specifications very similar to much more expensive phones (iPhones, Samsung)
You can ser more and more people who think it's stupid to spend a lot of money on a phone just for the brand, especially on iPhones, because iTunes has a reputation for being complex and useless
Price difference and variety
IPhones are just one up-to-date model
If you want something chepaer you have to buy an older one
Meanwhile, there are tens of brands with different prize and quality ranges so people can adjust that to their budget and needs
I personally don't want an smartphone as expensive as an iPhone, I'd rather have one in the upper-middle range
Nowadays some brands even release different lines with a wide prize range depending on your interest
For example, some people are more interested in taking photos so you have entire lines of phones where the camera is excellent for its prize range but the processor isn't as good  but that's what some people are looking for
And if you want a top quality state-of-the-art smarthpone like the iPhone, you have different brands to pick with their own specs and design that you might like better
In the US Apple is just that huge because it's an American company and because of really good marketing, but in other parts of the world people acknowledge that there are many brands, and most happen to use Android
So it isn't really a competition between iPhone vs Android but of iPhone vs Samsung vs Sony Xperia vs Xiaomi vs Huawei vs LG vs Google Pixel, etc, etc
with most of those companies having different lines and different prizes
Edit: as other people said, iPhones and their accessories are kinda overpriced too and lack things like dual SIM
Apple products are for posh people
Apple products are just fancy and expensive but in terms of funcionalities offer less and are heavily restricted compared to non-apple producs
I've never payed more than 150€ for a phone and they have been really high quality ones, most of my friends have Chinese brands too, people don't really care about what phone other people use
Except if they use iPhone, I think here it has a bit of bad image
It is a capitalist American symbol, if you use an iPhone here is because you are a posh that only buys products to show off the brand but don't even have the hability to choose a good product (specs)
700€-1000€ is a ridiculous amount of money for a phone here, so if you buy that you're seen a spoilt child that doesn't understand the value of money and only wants to look cool
Most people uses Android and many people changes from Apple to Android
I like android and iphones  are ussualy very fragile
But thats it
Actually, the EU hit very hard Google for abusive dominant position as they were using the os to block non-google apps from competing
I mean, they are the same but Android is just cheaper
Buying an iPhone is only paying for the fashion brand
I agree with this
WhatsApp is so commonly used a standard messaging app, even some commerce and banks communicate with you through them, at least in Spain
Having a cross-system messaging system that is widely used like WhatsApp, Telegram or KakaoTalk, helps the fact that you don't need an iPhone to use iMessage or FaceTime
When I moved to the US, in the Midwest, nobody knew what WhatsApp is, and most people still don't even know it
Yeah, that's 100% true
In Spain we love to buy "good deals", we generally don't care about getting a 1000€ phone, we care about getting a 500€ phone that is almost as good as the 1000€ one and then tell everybody about it hahaha a crazy amount of people is buying Xiomii phones now, some years ago a lot of people was buying OnePlus, etc
I said in another comment but Spain is the second market in volume of Aliexpress, just behind Russia, so
we are in a kind of secret affair with China
I'm a Spaniard too and I'm very happy with my xiaomi and I've had apple phones before but honestly I just prefer to buy a phone with good specs than paying double for something because it has an apple on it
And about iTunes, that system is rubbish and limits you just because they can, I prefer to pay for Spotify than use iTunes for one more day
Buying an iPhone over a comparable yet cheaperAndroid/whatever model is a bad way to handle money
You’re ignoring people who like the iPhone aesthetics or Apple ecosystem
I mean, even if the Chinese gvernment has acces to our data through Chinese companies, so does the American government from Google through Android an all the Google services we use and from Facebook trhough Facebook itself, Instagram, Whatsapp
Very cool, yeah this is also my impression
In the US the government buys the info from the companies, while in China the government might force them  to give them
People were shot dead just to steal the Air Jordans from them
Madrid
Like seriously, (not generalising, some of them) are the personification of the snobism and the greed
This is gonna be controversial, but Madrid
Because of centralism, news often focus on the capital, money flows towards the capital, and some inhabitants there think to be the State à la Louis XIV
It's relatively new compared to some of our Roman and medieval metropolis, its cultural heritage is relatively scarce compared to at least any other in the top 10 most populated and it is at the farthest point of any coast in the country
Some people there have the twisted idea that their city is the most beautiful, that they speak the most perfect Spanish and that there's a reason for it to be the most productive besides its capital status
Those people are wrong, and its embarrassing to see them pointlessly argue
Murcia
They are a different breed over there
Recently it's also joked about for having extremely high support for the party VOX
Honestly, Valencia
It is a love/hate kind of thing
On one hand it has a lot of beautiful places and landmarks, great climate (except heatwaves), rich history and culture plus own language, lots of fun and so on
But at the same time I am truly convinced that it has the highest concentration of dumb twats, crazy far-right hooligans and douchebags per capita in the universe, full of corruption, total lack of decent urban planning (planning in general), underfunded subpar public transportation for its metro area, and trying to go full Barcelona 2
0 in everything that has to do with tourism without learning
(My personal opinion)
In Spain, everyone makes fun of a southern region called Murcia
It’s a small, dry, poor region and locals have a somewhat weird accent that makes them sound dumb
HOWEVER, my family owns a little house there, so I have spent most of my summers in the area, and I have to say that it’s nicer than many people think
It’s got great climate all year round and you get used to its people :)
Also, the capital (also called Murcia, duh) is wildly underrated
It’s full of monuments and history, not to mention its lively summer nights
Anyways, if you reading this ever have the chance of visiting don’t miss out ;)
Madrid
It’s ugly, grey and boring, and the people seem annoyed and unfriendly all the time
Just my perspective though, coming from the south it’s easy to think other people look unfriendly but it could be just how normal people are I guess
Wasn't like 40% of the population from out of France
Honestly, I think Madrid is quite underrated
People living in Madrid are all very friendly and welcome and some old parts of the capital are very well preserved
Also you can find some amazing places to eat tapas and have a beer with friends at a good price
And I'm from Barcelona btw so I'm digging my own grave
I would say that any coast city taken by brits and German youth are the worst, I live relatively close to Salou, Calella and all that jazz and its horrible how dirty and full of underage drunks they are
Wow too much hate here, just because you hear some politicians who talk like this it doesn't mean that madrileños think actually think it
I'm catalan and I met lots of Madrileños while living abroad, they are in general some of the most formidable people I've met
We all know that Madrid is the capital because it's in the middle of the country, no way to deny it, but you must admit that as a result they have the best Spanish museums (in the world's top ten), the best theater life, good restaurants and plenty of sightseeing, just walking around the barrio de las letras is worthy to visit it
And hey, my city was founded by the Romans and I live by the sea but I can still visit Madrid and enjoy it
There are far worse cities in Spain, honestly
I would say that Benidorm or Lloret with their massified turism are a better example
I live in Alcorcón in Madrid, but I wouldn’t say the capitals simply because of our fútbol :( We need Real and Atletico
As well many of our businesses are centered there so it’s kind of very important
But our Spanish is
much slang
Slides on the tongue more jeje
I prefer cuidadonos, or PP though
No, that's just bonus material for jokes
I don't actually have a dislike for Murcia or Murcianos but it's clear from all the memes that it's like the odd one out in Spain
Same happened with me in Lisboa
I love Portugal but is really dirty
Oh so that’s where mermaids are from
We don't need them bc your not expected to be EXACTLY at the time, you'll have like a ten minutes margin
"Taba ocupao follandome a tu madre"
"I was busy fucking your mother"
I say it when talking with very close friends
"There was a traffic jam" if you go by car
Or "I came across someone who speaks to much".
In Spain we don't need an excuse to be late, we just are
It was impossible to park, but most of the time it's true, so
Same in Spain
We truly are brothers
Same in Madrid but with the subway (I don't know in the rest of Spain)
Although it is something my mother would say in the 90s, it is no longer very common
Nice one, love your cycling culture
If I say that to my boss in Spain he might think I'm on drugs or something
I used to take the green line everyday, I didn't even need a excuse to be late
A  perk of living near the slowest underground line in the city
Imagine going up to your boss and saying that lmao
Walloon is a language native to Wallonia (and parts of Northern France) separate from French
But afaik it's basically gone because due to the cultural influence of France after the French Revolution, French was imposed in schools and it's nowadays what Wallons speak
If we can call something a Belgian language, it would be Walloon
I would say Spain is the guy that arrives one and a half hours late, has breakfast in the cafeteria while Italy is preparing the pasta for lunch
They have a nice little chat and Spain goes to their office
Nobody knows how Spain got an office while most other guys on their floor are in desks (except for management aka
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium)
So Spain starts answering emails from the week before but before he can start working proper, the computer fails
Headed down to I.T., Spain realises they have no idea who's in charge: "excuse me". A number of vodka bottles are promptly hidden in drawers as the slavic men stare Spain
"My computer's stuck at the home screen". They all start speaking in an incomprehensible language and finally Romania stands up: "let's have a look".
Back at the office, Spain is explaining the problem in detail but Romania is not listening
He slaps the front of the computer and the screen unfreezes
As Romania leaves the room, he hears: "Oh, well
Thank you" and turns around, surprised
Spain doesn't know this, but Romania can count with the fingers of a hand how many times he's been thanked for his work
So he invites Spain over for vodka next time he's by I.T. "Nice" thinks Spain
By this point Sweden has completed the days work and most people are having lunch
Spain starts working
He sees Germany fly past his door to go scream Italy for spending too much on garlic, probably
Nevermind Germany, why is the desk so cluttered
"I really have to sort out this real estate, it's a chaos" he thinks to himself
As Greece walks down the hall she throws a faint smile into his office
Despite her tired look, it warms his heart
"Poor girl, Greece" Spain thinks
"She really deserves better".
A while later, Spain is on his way to the cafeteria for lunch
He is the only one eating so late, but it's usually a good chance to catch up with Italy
Being pals with the cook is always nice, as you can get your food warmed up no matter how late
Spain sees Finland and Sweden on their way to the parking
Lucky souls
, getting home so early, but he knows he couldn't bring himself to wake up at 5 a.m. to mimick their schedule
Spain isn't sure if she should say goodbye
Have they seen her
Sweden is pointedly looking at the door
Oh, too late
"Hey Italy, what's the deal
" Italy looks pale and her eyes are red
"Have you been crying
" "Oh, Spain, it's terrible
Germany is threatening to fire me
" "Italy, why the fuck is that
Did you tell France about it
". As the conversation escalated, their hands jumped faster and faster in the air, as if conducting an invisible orchestra
"Oh, yes, France says if Germany fires me she'll bring out the guillotine, but then they both agreed that I can't come back to work for at least a month" Spain was getting more and more confused
"Oh, I forgot to explain" realised Italy
"Apparently I have a virus" "A virus
" "Yeah, but I'm fine
I probably caught it from China last week
She's been stuck at home, but I don't feel sick at all, and at worst it's gonna be a silly flu". "Well, I get that Germany would be worried about the food
" "Do you think I'm fucking stupid
" abrupted Italy
"I've been cooking with a face mask and gloves
There's nothing to worry about". "Oh in that case there's probably nothing to worry about" Spain admitted
"I guess I'll have some, then" he laughed
Italy laughed along as  he served the pasta
It was nice getting to laugh with a friend after such a stressful day
"Italy" said Spain after finishing his meal
"You'd be getting paid leave anyways, right
" Italy nodded
"You should take it then
We won't be eating so well, but you'll get to rest and recover sooner
" Italy stared through the window for a long moment
"I'll think about it, amico". They smiled and Spain got back to his office
He had a lot of work to do
"I'm telling you, Germany" said Netherlands angrily while waving a long sheet of paper on his boss' face
"Our finances are tight and perfectly calculated
We can't start giving away free money for our employees **not to come to work**". "Netherlands, I'm telling you to calm down". As he turned the corner, Spain saw the two figures in heated discussion
Rather, he saw the calm but annoyed silhouette of Germany standing the hot rage of the Netherlands
Netherlands saw him too
"Oh, look at him, boss
He's just now finished his lunch
Surely getting ready for a well deserved siesta to rack up his working hours
". "Netherlands, that's not how we talk to each other in this company". But Spain was all out of patience for the day: "How nice and professional, talking shit behind Italy's back
Like you didn't get a month paid leave last time your house flooded
". Netherlands looked at Spain with poison in his eyes, but he kept talking: "Oh, and the one before that
My god, how many floods is this company gonna pay you for
" "Shut your mouth, you Catholic monkey
". Germany gave a him a look of disapproval
"Make me, you whiny protestant bitch". "Spain
" Germany said in a desperate attempt to keep the appearance of discipline
"Please, go back to work". Spain and Netherlands shared a last look of hatred and everyone went their bitter ways
The sun was setting down and Spain had almost finished
Maybe today she would even have time left to check her email and leave everything ready for tomorrow
France opened the door: "I assume you didn't even think of staying away from Italy". Spain bounced in his chair out of surprise: "What
". "Right
I'm getting you tested
Tomorrow you'll go to Canada's clinic before coming here, and if you test positive you'll be on sick leave
" "But France, you can't start getting people out of work like this
The company will come to a hault
" "It's for everyone's safety, Spain
I'm here to protect the workers, and the workers are at risk". "But why
, it's just a flu". "A FLU
A flu wouldn't put China on the ICU
A flu wouldn't have left her breathing through a tube
This is serious". France was shaking
Spain looked down: "Oh
I understand
I'm sorry
" "It's not your fault, mon ami
I'm sorry too, this situation is overwhelming, but I shouldn't have screamed
Panic only makes things worse". "No offense, then
Thank you for letting me know". France smiled, but Spain's faced looked somber: "One more thing, France" "Oui
" "Will we really be getting support from the company if we can't come work
I overheard Germany and the NetherDamn before
They didn't seem eager
" France looked uncomfortable: "to be honest
I don't know
But I will do what I can". "It's alright, France
Health first
We will fight the money fight when this is over".
France left with the dying dusk and the yellow light of the streetlamps filled the office with shadows
Spain sighed and turned off the computer
As always, he wasn't able to do everything
Looking on the bright side, all that was important was finished
Most of it good work
"How long until he'd be at this office again
" He gathered his things and locked the door, heading for the street
When he left the building he looked to the side
Sitting against the wall was Syria, with a cardboard box containing several coins and an old mark bill
Spain knew Syria from years ago, when he worked at a company nearby
He had heard the rumors: in fighting, foreign investment, a takeover and finally a tragic explosion
He didn't know much of the deal, but it was undoubtedly a sad story
He took out his wallet and put a 2€ coin in his only hand
It would have felt weird to give a bill to a beggar
Syria smiled briefly, but quickly looked away
"If only I could do more" Spain thought
As he walked away, he heard a faint, dry sound
Probably a pigeon's wings flapping, or a window closing somewhere
Hopefully not a cough
"Please, let it be anything but that".
We work in the cafeteria
Or we're just unemployed
Travel agent maybe
Spain [hasn’t showed up to the office in years and is still collecting a paycheck]
We are the cubicle where you go when you are tired from work and want to talk with the guy who is there, but even though that guy is fucked up in that cubicle he will try to make a nice time for you
HR because we're sociable and stuff
But it'd backfire and in reality we'd spend most of the time at the bar just around the corner of the office building having a coffee or a beer with our work colleagues
The one that doesn't know what is doing here but is happy to be, probably
Spain is that one guy who doesn't take anything seriously and shows up late everyday
Job you say
The marketing guy
He gets close to everyone, sometimes too close
Underpaid intern that somehow remains in the company despite having to search the internet to solve the problems because he/she is utterly useless
Arrives always late, annoys co-workers by being extremely loud and can't even get along with people in his department
Tries to hide it by dressing cool and seducing ~~european tourists and expats and Germany's leadership~~ the boss
The guy/girl that makes coffees
I want to say events planner, like preparing the company parties and everything (not really efficient but fun nevertheless)
You can be my +1 to the office Christmas party
Australians are always good to have around
pop down to the bottle o and grab us a slab of mangoes, will ya
XXXX Gold- the Milton mango
(My girlfriend is from Brisbane so I’ve spent quite a bit of time in QLD)
I’ll never turn away a cold VB
Yes
And my accent is completely fucked lol
I have a mixture of my own Spanish accent, the British standard and whatever is the norm in American media (Californian
New Yorker
I'm not consistent with pronunciation nor with spelling nor with vocabulary
I did learn British English so that's what I try to speak and write
But since I left formal educaction I just go with whatever comes to my mind, although I recognise that I shouldn't do it
I used to be more consistent when I watched more British shows but now that I think about it, all the shows I watch in English nowadays are American
Holy sh\*\* yes, as someone studying translation its a pain in the ass
Yes, and since I work with both Brits and Americans I just don't know which spelling to use or if I'm using the 'wrong' words
I figure I sound like those English speakers that learn a type of South American Spanish and come to Spain lol
My accent is basically American though
Absolutely, and because of the main media I consume is American, when I try to speak English, I try to do an American accent because it's what I am more used to
The importance they place on race
Seven years ago, my gf and I went to visit friends in Florida and had a very creepy experience at the airport in NY
I'm very white skinned and light haired and my gf is more tanned and dark haired, more Mediterranean
We both put white race on the forms you have to fill in before entering the country and they accused us of lying because she was Latina
For us that was a sock, in Spain, Latino is used for a person whose country of origin is Latin American, not a race
They also insisted that it could be a crime for having lied on a form, and that race was something very important for health insurance (????? fcking creepy)
Anyway, we were pretty scared but we managed to sort it out and we were reconciled with our Roman Latino blood
There were many other things that surprised us, the one I found most annoying was having to pay tips everywhere and having to calculate tips all time
On the other hand, as others have said, you get so much food in one order that we were able to share a plate almost everywhere and save a few dollars (although the staff gave us the stink eye
Addressing adults by their first name is quite common in Spain
Here in Spain we do walk with shoes within house
People wear shoes inside their homes
So strange
Everyone on reddit seems to think that wearing shoes inside your house is weird, but me, my whole family, and almost everyone I have met in person wears them inside their house
I was in Dublin a couple of years ago for the first time in 10 years and I was surprised about the number of homeless people I saw
Did the problem get much worse between 2008 and 2018
[Cross post from /r/es/ \(Spain\)]
The US incarceration rate is the highest in the world
If I were you, I wouldn't be denying the issue with anecdotal experience
I would be [worried]
Yeah, frickish central europeans
and British
and scandinavian
and
i'm seeing a pattern here
Do you really call female teachers pana
I don't mean getting on the couch or bed with shoes, I mean just wearing them inside the house
I loved the massive American portions, I wish they were more common here
I just love junk food (having it once in a while, that is)
Ok, thanks
It sounded weird because in latinoamerican spanish, it would be the same as calling your teacher bro or homie
Partiendo la pana mi pana
The king announced that he would retire the former king (his still alive father) from the list of members who recieve public money because of the existing scandal around money washing and corruption he was involved
He also renounced to the heritage
Sadly it appeared only 1 or 2 days in the news and can´t be put on court as probably most of us would like until the pandemic is over
And it is not clear if the current king knew about it since long ago and only decided to act like this now that it kind of got discovered or if the really wasnt profiting from the corruption at all
There are some news about the former king being corrupt but, actually that's usual with our politics here in Spain, so even if this situation hasn't drawn the attention, nothing would have happened
Fascists and former government party are asking for a military coup, if that counts
I don't know, and that's the problem
They only cover Covid 19 in the news
It's not an exaggeration, there's only one daily new that's not about the virus
Bad stuff is certainly happening because bad stuff always happens, but it's just not getting covered
The government just paid 100 million € to the Big media companies to wash their image and make false statistics
There is a virus that is killing people and that draws attention to everybody, at the same time Whatsapp is being censored by a far-left newspaper (Newtral) and TV is being controlled by the leftists as well
It's a shame seeing how they're getting in control of the media and even social networks while we can't do anything to prevent it, in 20 years we'll be Venezuela
But is that bad thing or is it just something that was innevitable
Alitalia has been borrowing public money for years now, and I dont think they would ever been able to return it, so rather than just throwing money at them maybe nationalised it can at least go even (although well, with the current stand fly companies are not really good in terms of future growths
yep, the guy basically stole 100 million euros and gave it to their son in inheritance, the current king
The King didn't say or act at all during the first outbreak of COVID-19 and only appeared 10 mins on TV with a shitty speech trying to get everyone to fight the pandemic while he seats in his palace paid by everyone's taxes
Then, lowkey he gave the 100 million to his daughter (the heiress) and said he "refused" his father's inheritance but hey, you also inherited the crown, you know what I mean, you cannot refuse an inheritance by parts
Do polls predict that he's going to lose or smth
I honestly think this is not reason to be worried yet
They are just starting the mud machine, which will run continously for the next 4 years or until they win an election
Hopefully the far right doesn't have so much support and most people here really reject violence because of the past horrors
All in all, our democracy is probably not in danger, but we must be ready to defend it and fight their lies and hate
Is this a lie as well
I don't want to believe it, I don't want to believe that Spain has already crossed the line and there's no way back, that I will have to migrate to another country before this one gets destroyed, but it's obvious that the cycle has started
Enjoy it
Our center-right Party (2nd biggest) is called PP
Wouldn't be surprised if by the end of the year Napoleon came back from the dead and restored the French Empire
Probably not the craziest thing that could happen this year
So Newtral is only censoring Facebook, we must accept that, if it's only facebook is not a big deal, right
Newtral creates hoaxes and fake news that benefit the left
The 5 main TV channels (TVE, Telecinco, Antena3, LaSexta and Cuatro) are awfully left-winged
But it's obvious that leftists like the one posting above you are very happy to have those so they can control the population
And remember, being the worst country in the world regarding Coronavirus handling is not the government fault, being one of the worst countries handling 2008 crisis is not government fault (it was leftist at the time), only bad luck, always bad luck and hoaxes everywhere xDDDDD
You should've said "Thanks for the explanation, now my country will accept coronabonds so your country can give free money to everybody"
Antena3 awfully left winged lmao
None of them are leftwinged, maybe TVE and LaSexta a little bit socialdemocrat
Come back to the 50's, fascist
hahahaha "none of them are leftwinged,. Maybe Lasexta and TVE" he says
Telecinco with 6 hours every single day of Salvame shitting on everything and everyone with right ideology is neutral xDDDDDDDD Where is the hidden camera bro
Is this a prank
Jorge Javier Vázquez, vanguard of the worker class, the spanish Lenin
You guys live in a parallel world
Hahaha now Jorge Javier is not a leftist, what else
For men: Casimiro, Bonifacio, Severino, Eustaquio, Anastasio
For women: Gregoria, Tomasa, Rufina
Leovigildo (M) and Baldomera (F)
Spain
Telesforo, Nemesio, Agapito, Saturnino, Anselmo
for male
Hermenegilda, Gertrudis, Eustaquia, Fulgencia for female
Male: Espiridión, Wenceslao, Hipólito, Macario
Female: Auxilio, Socorro, Urraca, Reparada
In Spain I think that would be Hermenegildo
Rogelia, Umberto, Athanasio, Lazaro, Theodora, Bonifacia
just from looking at the oldest members of my family tree from the 17th and 18th century
I would've gone with Hermenegildo
[Here's a myriad of them
Angustias (Sorrows), Brígida, Esperanza (Hope), Bienvenida (Welcome)
Yes
In Spain, WELCOME (The Spanish translation) is an actual name
Any visigothic sounding name really
Que no falte Hermenegildo
>Spain
Horacio and Genaro as well
The future queen of Spain is called Leonor
I know some people called Ludmilla that are from South America, It's more common there than in Spain
De los nombres que he mencionado únicamente conozco a un Bonifacio, que era profesor mío de la universidad, de más de 70 años
Yes, Casimiro would be the Spanish version of it
However the literal translation is "almost" (casi) and "see" (miro, mirar)
So it's ironic when a blind person is called Casimiro
Same
super popular here too
Yes, Alfonso is a spanish name
Yes
idk
The famous one here is Urraca de Zamora (and had no sister called Raimunda), but it was a common name during the middle age between the nobility, there were a lot of queens, infantas, etc
called Urraca
In Spain double names are very normal (with a few exceptions such as Borja María), but TRIPLE names are seen as very burgeois
Balenciaga was a tailor from a town like 30 minutes from me
He was a "basque" I put that in quotes because it's a sensitive topic in Spain
I agree with it, definitely, although it should have been done earlier
I also have to say that as someone who comes from an area that largely depends on coal mining (and that's already very heavily in decline since like 40 years ago), I hope they try to maybe fund some industry here so the area doesn't die
Otherwise, of the about 100
000 people currently living around here, I don't think half will remain in 30 years time
Yes, I lived in the UK for a few years and then I came back to Spain
I have a English teaching business therefore I may spend most days speaking English, whence someone speaks to me in Spanish or catalan it may take me a few moments to realise and "change" it
Yes, once I was working and one of the customers realized I speak Spanish and start talking in Spanish without previous warning and my brain was so confused for seconds he apologized as he thought I didn't speak Spanish at all
Also when I listen to [people from Gibralta] or Latin-American people living in the USA speaking half Spanish half English I can't get much of what they are saying even when they are using words I know in both languages
Yes,  sometimes
It also happens to me with spanish/galician
Even sometimes i dont know if the last sentece i said it in spanish or galician
Interesting, to me it sounds like a dutch trying to speak russian but he's having a stroke
Spain is currently the country with the biggest number of biosphere reserves
Our timezone should be UTC, but we use CET/CEST because Francisco Franco changed it back in 1942 to be in the same timezone as Italy, Germany
and we haven't changed it
Our anthem is the third oldest in the world and one of the few without official lyrics
The Quijote, by Cervantes, is often considered as one of the most important novels throughout history (and ofc, it's written by a spaniard)
We are the country with the largest organ donation, contributing with 20% of organ donations in the EU and 6% in the whole world
PS: Sorry if there are some minor gramatical errors
My English is not the best out there
The say "the Sun never sets on the British empire" used to be ours "the Sun never sets on the spanish empire". It was coined because at one point we had territories in all 5 continents, Including a firm grip over Europe with much of Southern italy, the duchy of milan, much of the netherlands, parts of western and Southern France, belgium and malta having been under spanish rule
Spain was a important part of the roman empire
We have many ruins along our territory, including one of the few complete roman city walls (Lugo)
In fact we're part of that legacy, much of our current population is descendent of the native celts (and iberians) and the roman conquerors, with little posterior addmixture
Spain is extremely mountainous
We have rugged terrain in the north south and center, that means that even with 40°C summers in the Major cities we have snow all year long on some mountains
By the way our Highest peak is actually on the canary island off the coast of Africa mt Teide (4300m)
Spain is home to one of the most important archaelogical sites in Europe, Altamira
This site was the first place where cave paintings we're found, then unheard of, and is to this day one of the best examples of cave art
the french expert kept denying their veracity until they found cave paintings of their own
We are a land of writers
Everybody knows about Miguel de Cervantes but we have many authors: Francisco de Quevedo, Lorca, Lope de Vega, becqer, Unamuno, Machado, Delibes, Juan Ramón Jiménez
And many more
After all we have 6 literary Nobel
out of our 8 Nobel
- Spain is the oldest Spanish country in Europe
- Spain has the biggest biodiversity within Spanish territory
- No other single country in Europe has as many Spanish speakers that can also speak Euskera
- Spain has the biggest beach in the world that is located in Spain
-Spanish people will try a stick on you to find out if it results in new invention
...apnd so many others
I'm sure the coffee thing is to fight those long hours of darkness
The Quixote is considered the first modern novel too
I was about to write a list just for your number 5 but you added it first ;-)
I'd add:
Spain is the 3rd country with more UNESCO declared world heritage sites
The world's oldest restaurant is located in Madrid, Restaurante Botín.
Andorra shares 2 head of state (Co princes), 1 from Spain (the Urgell Bishop) and 1 from France (the president of France)
We were the 3rd country legalising same sex marriage
Spain played an important part in USA independence from the British Empire providing
supplies and munitions as well as financial support
And apparently we invented the submarine, the astronaut suit, the mop, the lollipop and other kind of stuff putting togheter a stick+something
Actual en inglés no es "actual" sino "current". Es un falso amigo
La palabra actual en inglés significa algo así como "real" o "verdadero" (por ejemplo la expresión "actually" que significa "de hecho" o "en realidad")
Se usa para enfatizar
Dude, I remember how the Spanish sports media went crazy with that octopus
It became our unofficial hero of that World Cup
Agreed
Those are also very interesting
>The Quixote is considered the first modern novel too
By some, but many others consider Genji Monogatari (Japanese novel writen in the XI century) the first modern novel
To be fair I was expecting a rickroll (this is much better than what I was expecting)
Edit: how do you put your country's flag in your username
Genji Monogatari is considered the first novel, not the first MODERN novel
Let me translate what you say: I have no idea about literature
[Here] a link with a response from a fellow redditer
Some people believe sex education courses at schools teach kids as young as 6 how to masturbate and our government is communist
The communist government thing has become a meme tho
Wait
what
In Spain the new goverment wants to legalize euthanasia and is pro abortion, the rigth wing is saying they want to kill new borns and elders to save money on sanity
Healthcare, not sanity
There is little of the last one left among our government and politicians
>euthanasia for the depressed
Spain rate drops to 0%
"You know, the other day was walking through Sevilla and I found a Marta, told her, “Damn, for how long that we not see each other
" and she waved back
Talked for a while until that her rang the phone
Before going told her that had the shoe untied, that if  not was to fall
Ever since not her have seen more
And you
This hurts
The other day was I to walk with my dog and plus my sister through beach when found us with a jellyfish
Despite that was good death, a mine little she-dog started bark like it us was to attack
(From Galicia, don't know if it would be too different)
A idea demential
We go to butcher the English and no I regret of participate
Make cold today here, I go put me one jacket, and after I go cook macaroni for the hour of the food because I have hunger
This afternoon I go to go to work and no it appeal me nothing
Greetings of Spain
No understand how is possible that take the pie of the oven fresh in turn of hot or at least warm
Heat the things in the fridge
Seems Japangrish hehehe
Too have a friend called Marta
Met her in the high school there for the 2013
Long time no speak with her, but am sure that if to meet, would like a reunion between old friends
Last night, i and my Friends went to a restaurant very fancy
Not half bad
Suppose that It seems a lot, but here goes the version spanish
Uff what say, well, yesterday made strudel and zabaione, the strudel was great and the zabaione was curious
The problem IS that i not know if get out well, because never that have tasted
Some clue
By truth, yesterday find out of that lagrange was italian
Not have none idea
The part of wanker mine me has intrigued
pop down to the bottle-o and grab us a slab of tinnies mate, cheers
¿Have the same rigidity in the order of the words the Norwegian that the English
That funny, could do other thread about the order of the words that uses Yoda in each language
In certain way
We say "le dije" that is difficult of translate, because "le" is a pronoun complex
It use  to substitute the complement indirect and it puts beforethe (yes, goes together) verb
Further not has gender, so that It could put as "her/him/It told" or even "you told"
All the It are "lo", another strange pronoun, except the last one which is "se" the strangest "pronoun" (It can even be a part of verbs, it's complicated)
Pretty sure they do it in Catalan as well
Think that in reality is in Spanish the unique idiom of the bunch in the that is done
Fuck, to write this me provokes ache of head
fuckin' oath cunt, i'll bring the bevvies and we'll take your tinnie out for the arvo
(my ex gf was aussie so I *might* have picked up a bit of the local lingo)
That must be great
Here reigns the chaos
By true, live in new zealanad or be in travel
Too it we do in Galician
Well, always have though that for example in English, that no it had counted as part of the bunch Romance, "another" is in truth "one other", so too
Me feels Japanese now for some motive hehe
Three years
Fuck and in new zealand
Has to be great
some reason in special to go to study to the other point of the globe
In plain English: to some extent but not as much as you may think
Both have plenty of particular gramatical figures
Sorry, I am too lazy for that and I don't have a backgroung on languages
But I am a Galician native and I also lived in Portugal for swveral years
I give you one, duality on "te" and "che" pronouns in Galician
Pronouns, pronomes pessoais
Yes, I would like that
There are more than a few reasons to support a boycott (starting with how Qatar was selected to host the World Cup)
I do not think it will happen, though :(
Impossible
Those mfs have so many relations with Qatar
Yes, i agree
An example is how two American soldiers that killed two Spanish journalists in Iraq have been protected by the US and there is no way we can bring them to justice before the Spanish court
The US is just a bully, and I say that despite living in the country
I’m sure you were really sad about that honey producers
Rajoy once said "España es una gran nación. Y los españoles muy españoles y muchos españoles" which in English would be
"Spain is a great Nation
And the Spaniards very Spaniards and a lot of Spaniards"
"the Spaniards very Spaniards and a lot Spaniards" Mariano Rajoy, former president
He has a lot more like this
"Esto no es como el agua que cae del cielo sin que se sepa exactamente por qué..."
"This is not like the water that drops from the sky (rain) that drops and nobody know exactly why" Mariano Rajoy, it was the  Prime minister when he said nobody knows why rain happens or what causes it
In 1981 a former ministry of health said: "the illness is caused by a tiny bug
It's so small that if it falls from the table it dies". He said this about a sanitary crisis with rapeseed oil when the government still didn't know about what caused the sickness
Uuuuh, Mariono Rajoy (former president with clear speaking problems)  said many nonsense things
Like "Spain is a great nation, and the spanish very spanish a lot spanish" (literal translation, it didn't make sense in spanish either)
Or "we have to build robots because what robots will never do is build more robots". A good one I love is "Long live wine
Mariano Rajoy
"Spain is a great nation, and the Spaniards very Spaniards and much Spaniards"
"75 million Spaniards come to Spain each year"
"ETA (the basque terrorist group) is a great nation"
"Catalans are entrepeneurs, they make things"
"A glass is a glass and a dish is a dish"
"Is the neighbor who chooses the mayor and is the mayor who wants the neighbor to be the mayor"
And many more
Mariano Rajoy was Spain's president
We are in the Champions League of the economy - Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, 2007
Our former president Mariano Rajoy was a factory of nonsense and stupid phrases
His page in Wikiquote is a goldmine :  [
But my favourite came from Ana Botella as Mayor of Madrid in 2013 and her infamous speech for the Olympic 2020 bid in front of the International Olympics Commitee
Her english was pretty rudimentary but everyone here remembers the quote:
>"[There's nothing quite like a relaxing cup of *café con leche* in *plaza mayor*?]
Another big one came from Esperanza Aguirre when she was running for Mayor of Madrid in 2015 [on twitter] "*In Madrid everything that is not prohibited will be allowed
I like the Catalans because they *do things*
This [a political problem] is not like the water that falls down from the sky without anybody knowing how

Sorry, Spain is a great nation

-Mariano Rajoy Brey, a true enlightened thinker
Wow
So drunk pedestrians deserve to fucking die for the henious crime of walking home when drunk instead of driving
Any famous Rajoy sentence is a good answer to the post, really
Classics like "a dish is a dish and a glass is a glass" or "what we have come here to do, which is what you don't do yourself is
lying to the people".
When he was alleging that Catalans would lose their Spanish citizenship if they went independent in an interview, and the interviewer cut him off to tell him that was not the case
and he muttered: "What about European citizenship
" (¿Y la Europea
you could just see the clueless guy behind the transparent façade
Abascal said yesterday that the left has historically hated homosexuals and denied them rights
I'm not even surprised anymore
This didn't age well
Rajoy best boy
Rajoy had Trump levels of stupid phrases
Oh that moment was top Rajoy
Tbh I don't watch politics nor care about them
That I am aware
Yeah this are among my favorites but are quite hard to translate, hahah
I do miss having fun and whatnot, but he was a very bad president even if you ignore his possible corruption
So unaccountable
0 fucks given
On the second one he was trying to accuse another party of lying
For the life of me I can't say about the first one
I think in the first one he was trying to say "it is what it is" when talking about international and EU treaties about the self-determination right or lack thereof of Catalonia
He's just a sad fool who thinks that Spain right now is shit (which I can't deny, even if I support this new government) and that he is the only one that can fix this fuckup
He's also Trump's n°1 fan and his personal cocksucker, if you ask me
He could host a TV show
A united country and Spaniards treating each other like brothers
Don't worry, it's not happening
Gran Vía (the largest avenue in Madrid) is literally EMPTY
Here's a livecam, it's eerie:  [
Everything was unthinkable
Nobody drinking in the streets at 3:00 am
Worst time to be alive for sure
I don't care about the illness itself, I care about the million jobs that will disappear
People won't have what to eat
the unemployment rate will grow like never before
So many families will be shattered because of this
What hurts the most is knowing our governments had 1 month of advantage and they did not do anything
They did this to us
And then they speak wonderful things about the European Union
well, you condemned us to a shit life after this
I wish all Europe would have closed its borders when the first cases appeared, just like Russia did
Now they are just fine
Don't Germans work some of the least hours per capita though
Which is a good thing, on the opposite of the spectrum from eastern Asia who work themselves to death
Same here
Day 2 it's ending and I am already going nuts
My depression and anxiety are so high I've been sick all day
I can't imagine existing like this for, at least, a month
I don't think I'd be able to handle this quarantine
I think southern Europeans are behaving much better this time than those from the north
Maybe we are not that lazy and incompetent after all, and there are some prejudices against us
Kurde
Yes but now you can investigate the virus and learn a lot
Every day thousands of microbiologists and other professionals are researching treatments
Not all that, you can try to control the flow of people that gets infected, mostly so healthcare doesn't collapse so quickly
Talking from my perspective, Spanish government has failed
They reacted too slowly
Until Sunday they didn't order quarantine
Both president and vice-president wife's have coronavirus and they (president and vice-president) are not even on quarantine
Tourists are walking Madrid streets even if there are almost 6000 cases
No one gives a fuck honestly
I don't know how we let it get this far, honestly
we had the signs, we had China's example and methods
and yet we fucked it up
I am sorry, right now the picture is totally black for me
Thank you really much
Psychologically I am having a hard time
I know 15 days is not much, but we all know it's gonna last much more than that
That's why I am so afraid and anxious, because I don't see any horizon
Our life has stopped in every aspect, not just social, but academic, professional, with our own family members
I am afraid of how long will it last, and the consequences all this will have
Probably, almost all my family members are going to lose their jobs
I am graduating this year (let's see if coronavirus allows it) I was so excited because I saw that they were many opportunities available, so many things I had the chance to do
But now
It's all over
I'd be lucky if I am able to find a job
And that, to millions and millions of people
I am sorry if I am so negative but I am having a hard time
That you for your support, I really hope this all ends soon
We have to be united brothers, all of us
No matter where you are, this is the first time humanity has to work together to make it, for real
Here in Spain everybody thinks that Spain's different and we do nothing good and so on
But this time I think we are behaving more or less (with some exceptions, but watching Swiss, German and Dutch people acting the same way makes me think we are not that incompetent after all)
Hey Spanish here too, some of my friends are having a hard time with this too
We kinda sorted some ways for them to feel less anxious
We do group calls every day for some hours
Everyone does their things during the call but we feel more in company chatting while cooking or playing videogames (even if we don't play the same)
It's not much but it has worked for us all
Also, you will graduate this year for sure, this won't last for the rest of the year
I know it's a complex situation but it'll be over soon
As we are in similar situations feel free to DM if you need to talk about anything
We should had closed our borders when the first cases appeared
Even if it had economic consequences they would have never been what we are going to have now
Everyone ignored it
The first cases appeared back in January and they decided to ignore it, same in almost every European country
I honestly don't understand why they did not do that
I wonder if they really thought the virus would go away by itself without tracking other possible cases
Governments have done nothing right to control the coronavirus from expanding
We will be just like Italy
And then France will be the same as us, then Germany
then UK
we all gonna fall
Thank you
I know it's the best for us all but I am struggling
Today I felt better
I guess we'll get used to it
What made my day was how everyone in my barrio started clapping at 8 pm
I felt how we are all together in this, struggling
Everyone from nurses and doctors to workers and us, here and everywhere in the world
I know it may be silly but it made me feel nice
Thank you so much for your advice, I'll try it
I don't really have the habit of making videocalls at all, I'll have to try it
Yeah the clapping also happened at 8 pm here in my neighbourhood
My sister works all day in a pharmacy and she really appreciates the support from everyone
I didn't like videocalls either but it's making the long days easier
Glad I can help
Blame game
I am blaming Spanish government, I have that right since it concerns me
It's not 1918
Your argument it's kind of invalid since we have a lot more of resources now
Back in 1918 medicine was not as developed as now
we know a lot more things now that back then, that's s fact
Nope
I think Iceland is probably the country with the highest coolness per capita, if we exclude some micro states
New Zealand probably ranks higher in total coolness though
I always remember Iceland because of a dude named JOISPOI24
I wish I could say I don’t but sometimes I look at a map or hear a fun fact and I’m like “oh
Right
It still exists
” Only to forget about it 3 seconds after
would love to visit though
Sounds nice but **I'd much rather**  have them improve the already existing railines in the west i.e. making  them cheap enough to compete with the absurdly low airplane fares
I am not sure how the demand would be for High-Speed trains in Eastern Europe, as well as the orography of Greece and neighboring countries is the least welcoming one for trains and even less high-speed trains since the maximum curvature of a track is greatly reduced compared to standard trains
For that reason, I'm out
Afaik the construction of a line connecting Lisbon to Madrid and from there to the European network is in process
At least in Spain they're doing it assuming your government will eventually build their side and connect the line in Badajoz
On the bright side, we are building the line up until the border so if at some point you get funds to do so it wouldn't take too long to be connected to the rest of Europe through Barcelona or Bilbao
Depends of the question
But I think I search more for other countries comments, just because a lot of times there isn't an answer from a Spanish, but that's because Reddit is niche here
Edit: corrected a small spelling mistake
I always scroll down to see what those bastards say :)
Most of the time I can't find answers regarding spain so i just scroll normally
I try to be active, but either I don’t know how to answer, or more commonly, I’m not on reddit when a question is asked (I browse my homepage, not each individual sub, so I miss a lot)
Straight up, I'm just curious to see who else in Spain is in Reddit too
Yeah it's true, here in Spain is mostly UNICEF ads
I can't talk for all european countries because I've only lived in Spain and Germany, but yeah, they're very common
Yes i see them, whats the problem
When i was still lesrning english and i heard the N-word I thought it was just a fancy word for black
In no way offensive (since it is similar to the word negro in spanish)
So when I wrote it in a writing homework our american teacher had given us he almost choked, thinking i was some sort of neo nazi
I remember being auto-banned for saying "negro" while talking spanish in an online game
It just means black, as in the color, so i was really wierded out
Imagine getting autobanned for saying "green" in a foreign server lol
**Parachute** because it is identical to the French word and a calque of the Spanish Paracaídas (literally "Falls stopper")
Also my immature high school companions immediately pointed that Parachute can also be read in Spanish as: "for a drug-induced high".
I'm cackling right now
I can imagine your poor innocent family lol
In spanish you can either say Té o Infusión for tea
And Im not 100% sure abut this but technically I think Infusión is any beverage prepared with warm water and herbs, and té is an specific kind of infusión.
¿Chino en portugués es chinés, no
¿Por qué pensabas que era una palabra ofensiva en español
Por curiosidad :)
A funny second meaning of the word is a small stone or piece of gravel
So as a child it was forbidden to throw stones but sometimes you'd get permission to play/throw small chinos or chinitos (also chinitas)
It’s descriptive at least ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
I believe wardrobe comes from Spanish "guardarropa", literally clothesstore, although the pronunciation is markedly uglier IMO
Furniture is actually one of the few words that made me laugh ot loud in English class, it looks like an ancient curse and is pronounced like you're having a stroke
No yeah and i used the hard r and all
I might start learning Danish the, german isn't cutting it for me even with the latin tie
Aleluya in spanish
Wiener, delicatessen, hamster, wanderlust, zeitgeist
In a few parts of South America due to Native American influence, 'chino' refers to someone small, like a child
Or the traditional/formal meaning of a Chinese
Same in Spanish
I've only ever heard wop in mafia themed media
also we translate it into spaghetti
Ah yes, Spain, that famous region of Mexico/s
Spanjool is bad
It sounds like the correct pronunciation of the spanish version of español which is how we call ourselves when we speak in spanish
About the word Spaniard, I didnt know about that until I emigrated to USA and found out that the biggest forum of spanish expats is spaniards
So know, here in the US I describe myself as spaniard cause they associate spanish with latinoamericans
omg this is exactly what I though when I first heard the word
My mom is american and i grew up reading in english, just inventing the pronounciation for things, or just reading it how a spanish would read it
Most of my Harry Potter names were pronounced precisely how you did
Not to mention McGonagall, i read it wrong once and kept reading it wrong, to the point that someone mentioned her and i wondered who they were talking about lol
I read it as "mac-koh-nal"
The word Té us very commonly used in Spain, but spanish from Spain and spanish from latinoamerican countries have some variations,.so Im not sure about Ecuador
Vale, ya entiendo :)
Delicatessen and hamster are used
Also pistola, acordeón, vermú.
Yes, I have received the catalogue in the mail previously, it's even advertised on TV every year
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
No, you are not the only one
Our shops were offering Xmas foods and we were still wearing flipflops
I talk about Madrid
We went from flipflops to boots in 3 days, literally
I'm curious, why do you hate snow
I live in Mallorca, there are a lot of germans here and I have no bad words for most of the ones I've met, in fact I was surprised to discover that they're not as cold as the stereotype says (or maybe the ones that are like this don't come to live here)
During WW2 we were kind of neutral but we had volunteers fighting against the soviets with the germans so there was no anti-german feeling back then
There isn’t many anti-German feeling here, probably since a lot of Spanish people used to go to Germany (and still go nowadays) looking for better works
We do have harsh feelings against British people because they come to put beaches and trash everything and jump from our balconies killing or severely hurting themselves in the process
And maybe the French, for tricking us into thinking they would just invade Portugal and leave us alone :(
not in spain
well, maybe that thing about humor we do think, yes
In Spain no
But it is of someone that thinks like a Nazi, for example, someone racist, or a supremacist
I would say some cities think the opposite
Yeah, Germans are highly appreciated in Spain
There are friendly jokes but nothing offensive
You can say this about every other country too
There's nothing to ignite the lint when there's no hunger, no poverty, so don't worry, you'll be fine
I had an uncle who was very involved in geopolitics and economics that would rant about the implications of german banks in the 2008 crisis and current involvement in many european concerns
He was so passionate about the topic that sometimes it seemed a bit overboard
However, he was actually very well read, was invited often to TV interviews and had no ill-will towards the germans, just a bit of a judgement towards some policies & attitudes (see, austerity measures) that were contraproductive
Hey, that’s me
The thing in Mallorca is that British get all the bad reputation so people don't focus that much in the drunk germans
Yes, I don't want to offend brits but you go to Magaluf (mostly brits) nd Cala Ratjada (mostly germans) and the difference is like night and day
Brits get crazy, fighting, puking on the streets, jumping on cars, having sex on the beach 10 meters away from the streets where hundreds of people can see them
It's crazy, while drunk germans are not worse than drunk spaniards
PS: I know those people go there (to Magaluf) exactly to do that and are not representative of the british society
No offense intended
Danone was founded in Barcelona by a Lebanese guy
Super random, but I didn't know Carrefour was actually French
It just seemed so Spanish to me, I didn't question it
Wait wait wait, the one thing I thought Spain invented, Nutella, isn't Spanish at all
As someone who doesn't know German
Haha Weiner art lmao
I don't know, it was a dumb thing from when I was little, so I never questioned it
Therefore, I thought, it had to be Spanish
How do you pronounce Nutella
Do you mean your tea
Habsburgs together, stronk
Nu (like a cows mooo but with an n) te (like té) la
If it was a spanish word it would be Nuteya lol
I suppose, I was born here but my parents are British so it sounded Spanish enough for me lol
It could be better, faster and with more resources, but is one of the best things Europe has: Universal Healthcare
It would be definitely a good idea for the US
The thing is, US is made for enterprises and not for people, from my point of view (which I don't want to argue about)
I keep hearing things like having to pay hundreds for insulin, kids selling lemonade to pay for their parents medical expenses, having to pay for giving birth
I can't imagine the stress I'd be into if I didn't have universal Healthcare backup in my mind
Proposing the privatization of the Spanish Healthcare system is such a politically suicidal move not a single major party proposes it
If someone tried to do it anyway, he'd face major riots
We take it completely for granted
It works out well because it not only allows everyone to have access to healthcare, but establishes a minimum level of quality for private insurance as well, for people who want something better and can afford it
This means that private healthcare is also quite cheap
Well, my mother is Spanish, so I had it pretty easy
But I would suggest consulting with your local Spanish embassy/consulate
*My mother has cancer and had surgery, and treatment for 20 years already
*My father had heart surgery, and trauma surgery (that one last month)
&#x200B;
*I have no idea how much that cost
You just go to the hospital when you feel bad and that's it
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
in Spain is payed **thought taxes**. So for poor people is even cheaper as it's a progressive payment
(insurance in the US is flat)
Works pretty well and Spain has one the most **efficient systems** (great service and also being cheap for the government: Spain ranks 3th in efficiency behind city-states Hong Kong and Singapour)
Also **drugs are covered**. Tho middle-to-rich people has to pay a symbolic payment (1€-2€-4€)
&#x200B;
Healthcare is seen as a "national treasure" and people can't understand the US thing
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
*Note: US already spends more (%GDP) in PUBLIC healthcare like medicare and so than Spain for universal healthcare (US around 9% GDP in public money while Spain 8% in universal healthcare)
So most probably universal healthcare in the US would be super expensive
One of the reason is college costs
While in Europe is "free", few people in USA can afford to be doctors
This makes medical professions highly demanded and labour market make those salaries impossible
In Spain medicine studies is so demanded that there are doctor everywhere
being a doctor is just middle-high salary, not rich at all
This makes healthcare cheap
(there you have the* ***relationship between healthcare and college costs****)*
*Also, since there is only one costumer for medical supplies and drugs, the costumer --aka* ***Government-- has the monopoly and disproporcionate market power****. The government buys medical supplies though auctions
This brings the price of this items to almost the cost of production
Yes it's free, yes everyone and everything is covered, the only downside is that it's slow
You can wait months to receive test results sometimes
That said, you can always still get private medical insurance
I'd also like to point out that with a prescription the price of that medicine is greatly reduced
I can't tell you by how much off the top of my head, but I pay 3€ per month on allergy meds
I did it
It works out pretty well
Europe is rad
Do you have a way in to a country with public healthcare
Family members and such
>Another thing to consider: many Americans (myself included) have excellent healthcare coverage through our employer
Replacing private plans with a one-size-fits-all universal plan subject to public funding doesn't sound attractive to us
Do you believe that private hospitals and/or private health insurance does not exist over here
So Silicon Valley yuppies would have to pay redneck's healthcare
Doesn't sound bad
Also private plans still exist with public healthcare, and they are much cheaper
Yeah it's possible
I hope so, for me it's very sad to listen about people dying because they can't afford medicines
USA just wouldn't be as powerful without its workers and army
If you have citizenship of one EU country you can choose whatever country fits better for you
For retirement, Spain and Italy usually are the chosen ones for other EU citizens
Good health care, cheap housing and live cost compared to the north and far better weather (unless you have problems with hot weather)
I love Spain
If I didn't I wouldn't have stayed for 15 years
We've got areas and cities much wealthier and much more expensive to live in than others so every single one of our [autonomous communities] manages it's own healthcare system (think of it as California managing it in it's own way, Texas it's own way too, etc) and yet our healthcare system is still great and free for us
We obviously pay through taxes (apparently, 9
4% of our GDP), but less than what is spent in the USA (>17% of GDP)
There is plenty of private hospitals and private health plans
I just checked for myself and there's some plans without co-pay and most range from 40€ to 70€, I guess per month
I haven't had one of those yet, so I'm not 100% sure on the details
The first questions from americans are usually "doesn't it suck
" and "how about the wait times
", so check this: [
>The Spanish health care system is ranked as the 7th best healthcare in the world, as indicated in the year 2000 in a report by the [World Health Organization] Spain is ranked 1st in the world in organ transplants
Wait times *are* long for operations, but if you want you can pay out of pocket at a private hospital or go through your private insurance
If you go to an emergency room you will be looked at as soon as possible (those who are closer to dying will go faster, it's not a first come first serve)
We've got a lot of [health tourists] coming every year because our healthcare system **is** good even when you have to pay for it because you're not a citizen
&#x200B;
If I understood the situation correctly we are paying less in taxes *and* we don't need to pay after a hospital visit *and* we have optional access to private hospitals and health plans
and we aren't even #1, there's a bunch of countries who have it better
If you were living here you'd be paying less in taxes to sustain the healthcare system and your excellent plan would probably be 90% cheaper (or your wage would be higher because your employer would not have to be providing you with an expensive plan)
I'm saying all of this in a "look at what you can have" way, not just like "look at what *we* have". Vote for the right candidates and they will try to implement something similar to this
and with the US economic power and already existing great hospitals and doctors it could very well become the best healthcare system in the world
>Spain and Italy usually are the chosen ones for other EU citizens
Fun (kinda sad) fact: some towns have majors not able to talk spanish because most of the population are retired Europeans
I see no problem with it
If most population is german/ british or american/canadian is not that hard that the major is from those countries
I know
I'm just saying it's kinda sad that they left their country, bought enough property/spent enough time to gain citizenship and started electing their own on a different country
Something about 70 years old people away from their homeland makes me feel weird
They are welcomed tho, don't take it wrongly
All water in Spain is drinkable without any health problem, but the taste in the north-east is dull
And don't start me with memes about the water from Madrid
Tap water is what I drink everyday
I only drink bottled water when I travel
It depends on the region
Close to the mediterranean is often very hard to drink so people buy bottled water
Definitely, but btw depends more or less in the region, my region has one of the hardest water due to the high content of Ca and Mg in the ground that makes it really hard, good quality but really hard, my best friend use bottled water in his house but I don't know more people that do this tbh
It depends a lot in the region and the quality of the soil
Here in Madrid virtually everybody drinks tap water
In Málaga however you might find the opposite
No, at least where I live
Tap water in Barcelona tastes horribly
Here its pretty common
But i recomend you to buy a glass bottle since the plastic ones dissolve slowly since they are not intended for continuous use while the glass ones are designed for a continous use
Allow me to talk about the agua de Madrid
(it's a meme here, drinking tap water is common in all Spain but in the Canary Islands)
It's so common that "agua de Madrid" has become a meme due to how supposedly good it is
In other regions it may not taste so good but it's still very much drinkable
There can only be a problem in secluded regions where they may use water from a well
Yes, bottled water is quite common
Tap water is safe to drink, but many households still prefer to drink bottled water because it tends to taste better
This is partly regional, as some regions have better-tasting water than others
Barcelona in particular has extremely hard water and many people can’t stand the taste of it
in my town the water gets really bad during summer so i avoid tap water usually or drink very little if im thirsty
in other cities they have much better water treatment plants and people dont mind drinking from the tap in most of them, but i think bottled water is still dominant
It’s common here
In Madrid I always drank tap water because it’s very good but now that I live in Málaga even after installing an electric water softener I find the water too hard and usually drink (cheap) mineral water
Tap water unless I really need to drink water, then I go buy it
Even though my city's famous for it's water
in spain you only use water bottles if you have to carry it because you are in school or somewhere without a water tap in general
its funny how in some places we take pride on our tap water being better than in other places, although if you live near the sea the water probably isn´t potable
but i haven´t traveled enough to know if that is true for every place near the sea in spain
Water in Madrid is good, yes
I live in London and drink tap water, it's hard water but it's fine
I used a Brita tank for a few years, but not anymore
I can't blame him
Maybe I have not expressed myself correctly
&#x200B;
What I mean is that it slowly degrades over time, not that it literally dissolves,
&#x200B;
You will have noticed that for example if you use a bottle for months it will begin to be weaker, it is not that you will have a hole
&#x200B;
Sorry for the confusion jejeje
well i live in the dark zones so thats why i see tap water as the way to go
I'm currently learning French and a bit of German (C1 in English and, of course, native in Spanish)
I keep forgetting words in all 4 languages I hate my life
All the time, I speak English at work and with many foreigners so quite often  when I get home  I don't know how to say something in Spanish or catalan and only the  English word comes up
Quite infuriating, honestly
There hasn't been even one time I have thought "aguacate" before "avocado".
Often, mostly because I'm trying to get to the level of an English speaking native
I can struggle a lot in normal conversation, when my brain is thinking on a different language than the one I'm speaking in, and I have to translate everything before I say it
I doubt it happens to most people in Spain, though
It's more likely to happen if you're above the B2 level, in my opinion
Often, the other day i was playing (?) Word coach with my mother and as It went on i understood more english than spanish
Quite often
I spend a lot of time on the internet and talking to internet friends, which has helped improve my English a lot
So then I get the awkward situations with my rl friends in which I'm thinking of an English word but don't know the Spanish word and I have to explain it
I remember one time I was shopping with my mom and I wanted to told her we needed onions, but I couldn't remember the word in spanish (cebolla) for some reason
So I told her "necesitamos onions" (we need onions) and my mom stared at me with a strange look
I'm sorry mom I just couldn't remember hahaha
Happens really often to me
I work in tech and I've only worked abroad and in English
So I'm basically unable to explain what I do in French without sounding like an absolute illiterate wanker, using English words every 5 seconds
Oh, this is interesting
I feel like this is a problem that Spanish people don't usually have, since there are always some translations of most fantasy books, even if some are fan-made (those tend to have poor orthography, but they're free, so they're an acceptable option for those who don't speak English when there isn't an official translation)
It's a bit of a double edged sword, though
We have access to a lot of books in our native language but at the same time most people never learn any foreign languages properly
Such a mood
I often use incorrect anglicisms in Catalan, catalanisms in Spanish, and Spanish grammar in Mandarin (my home language)
Not letting a friend invite you to a drink when they are decided to
Like i've literally seen several screaming arguments because of this
Spain: do not assume that flamenco is the national culture
IT IS A SOUTHERN THING
In absolutely every TV show in the UK that takes place in Spain (and there are many) they insist on playing flamenco sounding music even when the show is about Catalonia, Galicia or the Basque Country, for example
It is infuriating
Talk about politics
You could lose friends because of that, since people here are heavily divided, because, whatever some guy say, the Civil War wounds are far from healed
Dont call us mexicans or colombians and dont use their esteriotipes on us, and dont use their expresions with us
our esteriotipes are allowed if you have a good relation but be carefull if you find someone that dont like it
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
also dont talk abaut politics never, it isnt relevant the relation, NEVER talk abaut inmigration politics and of course the civil war or the ww2
&#x200B;
do not try or say if someone is from Catalonia or the Basque country
and just to prevent  Galicians also no
The nationalities are a problem so dont talk abaut that also
I would like to add something to the discussion but it seems everything is allowed in Spain
I do it constantly with s scottish friend
He calls me lazy spaniard
Oh, we do that here as well, especially in small villages
>Don't say no to an old woman who is offering you a cup of tea
What if I absolutely despise hot tea
You Russians are so funny
2 meters
Your buble has a 2m radius
I mean for covid this is awesome but for normal life i'd feel as if i smelled weird or something .
Also, no farting seems like s good rule
I went once to a sauna in finland with a friend and his finnish friends and there was a lot of fake sexual straight gayness going on tho
You obviously don't attend people in your job
In Spain we use Holland always
Sometimes when politicians make a speech that is meant to be international they use Netherlands, if not, always Holland
In Spanish the Netherlands is litteraly translated to Holland
And Dutch is "Hollandish" or basically language of Holland
Sure we have a specific word for Netherlands but hardly anyone uses it
Man, not at all
Spain does not have real big NOs actually, just be friendly and get used to extrovert, talkative people
It is NOT a Southern thing
40 years living in the South and I have never, ever been to a tablao
I don't even have a clue about where the hell is even one
In Spain, depending on the people around you, you could be cheer up, killed or even watch a mini civil war just in front of you
It is very likely that you will bleed if you do that unless everyone around you start to give you back the nazi salute
Fachas y Rojos, nothing else
On behalf of Spain, sorry
Also, putting chorizo on macaroni, is it ok if
That's good for companies as people will have a worse time figuring out their value in the job market
I find the first rather weird, as in Spain we have stronger regionalism and say usually the city or province we are from
Canarian and Balearic people usually call mainland Spain "la península", for that matter
Depends on where you are living and the type of floors
Tiles might be ok, but if there is wooden floor you instinctly ask: Should I remove my shoes
Then if you live in Andalusia, the chances of having mud from the rain on your shoes are minimal, where I live in the UK it is 100% guaranteed you will have a solid centimetre of mud all over them haha
That's Xenophobia, not racism
Equally stupid and despicable
I've been living in London for three years and I had a few episodes as well about speaking in another language
The worst was two Scottish girls were teaching me a few Scottish words on the train to Edinburgh and a old man (bald, really red face like is going to blow up, very fat and smelling like beer) starts to yell at us saying "Speak English, you are in England" We were already in Scotland
So one of the girls call him off and said something like: "Speak Scottish you bloody gammon, you are in Scotland"
After that he became violent and the train has to stop one station before Edinburgh and was arrested
AMAZING
But it's funny watch a Spaniard, a Portuguese and an Italian, each one speaking in their own language but being able to communicate (if all speak really slow, I mean)
Yep, written are very, very similar, but as a Spaniard I understand Italian better than Portuguese
The first part, yes
Like come have a drink with me or else
The not accepting a drink is honestly more like offensive
Don't stop at letting people buy you drinks with no complaints
You should also start letting bars in your capital give free tapas
Yes, but it has to be similar to what the other is having (or maybe lower alcohol but deppending on the situation you can come out as weak)
Like for instance i just can't do shots
well americans see us as mexicans
and your flag is similar to the mexican flag so
if you make a joke abaut an spanish with an esteriotipe is good but you dont want to do that with a esteriotipe of another country
is like if you go to portugal and speak in spanish, its frustrating
same thing here, i don't even know why italians don't hate us yet
if they do it
We also have others such as Galician in Galicia, Basque in the Basque country and although there are people who consider it a dialect and others who consider it a language, there is also Valencian for Valencia
Nah, I'm Andalusian and if you call me as any other autonomous community I'm not  even to bother to correct you
It is not an issue
Valencian is another dialect of Catalan
I know some people like to think it is another language but Linguistics says it is the same language
Some people don't like it because they are anticatalanist, other people because they think a dialect is less than a language
It is not
Everybody speaks a dialect of a language
You should not
He is not the UK
> You pay for sitting, breathing and being generally alive here
Lol article 155 should be implemented exclusively to bring free tapas (back
) to Barcelona
Either a gin and tonic or a shot but of a lower alcohol %
In spanish, we have the word "manjar" but it evolved to only mean delicacy foods
I've just seen a video of Bald and Bankrupt in Albania and he talks to Albanians in Spanish
Spain has the highest youth unemployment in Europe
If only we made the minimum wage higher
that would convince people to hire young folks
It surprised me that I’ve been looking for a while and can’t find anything for Spain, and I guess that’s something Spain gets one of the lowest points in the rank: thinking that we’re a good country
We have SO MANY good things it’s honestly astounding and yet we’re still so surprised when we hear that foreigners actually find Spain to be such a good place
bruh I read this and immediately went like "no, obviously Spanish people hate their royalty more"
Luce mejor tricolor
The Spanish flag holds political right-wing connotations
Half the country doesn't feel represented with it
Maybe they're republican or smth
If they change the flag, i'll change with it, i personally don't have any opinion about it
Nah, we reserve that kind of hatred for other Spaniards when we discuss about the Civil War
Never with europeans (we haven't had any war with any european in the last 100 years so no one alive can remember) but the amount of latin americans that want us to know how "we" stole their gold is infuriatingly big
Not really
The only time I had a akward conversation was with an American that before asking for my name said: "you guys did a cool genocide in Mexico, how do you feel about it
"....
To which I replied, "I don't feel any connection to what the Crown of Castile did 400 years ago, still natives were integrated once they converted to catholicism while the US in the 1800's (when you are supposed to be more civilised than in 1500) were still killing natives and enslaving people"
He didn't say anything else
Imagine twi of your grandparents being on the republican side and the other two in the national
well when your empire was disolve and you have one of the bigger ratios of deaths of civilian and everione that enter the peninsula dedicates to destroy your infrastructure and industry and you where even an ally
is hard to support him a lot
i agree with you
The best answer to that is to say: Do you realize that the ones who made that cool genocide were your ancestors and not mine
My ancestors stayed here working on the land, yours went there killed a lot and raped a lot more
That first part sounds like the script for another "8 Apellidos Vascos" sequel, honestly
Chiuis
What's that
You mean "panchitos"?
No, because this was not a war of North vs
South, nor blacks vs whites, nor rich vs
poor, not a war that confronted two distinctive groups each with its own identity, but a war of literally neighbour against neighbour, friend against friend, brother against brother, son against father, people of you own blood who literally lived under your same roof killing each other, and so on
Then, after 40 years of settled dictatorship, it was called kind of a tabula rasa from a compromise between all parts involved in all the previous years
This would have probably ended badly, the people in favor of the dictatorship still had too much power back then
Even now it's really hard to uncover all the crimes they did and to get rid of their statues and monuments
This same week they had to send the police to watch over a property that belongs to the state and that is being recovered from the descendants of the dictator, to ensure nothing will be stolen or sold before there's an inventory of everything it contains (  )
It's infuriating because I had nothing to do with that, I don't have to take responsability for any of that
And even if I had to be held responsible for what my ancestors did, chances are my ancestors stayed in Spain the whole time and had nothing to do with that while the ancestors of those latin americans telling me that we stole their gold are the spaniards that actually stole their gold
The irony
You are right
Kind of
Native Enslavement was abolish with the Burgos act in 1512 by the Emperor
Additionally it was  re-abolished in a new law in 1837 meant for metropolitan Spain although no slaves were present in the peninsula since 1766 (when the government bought all the slaves and freed them)
Only Cuba and Puerto Rico, which had a special status, managed to keep slavery until the Spanish first Republic ended slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873 and in Cuba in 1886 (although it was locally forbidden to have new slaves 1880)
The Spanish-american war was nothing to do with slaves, but rather imperialism, monroe doctrine
what some people forget is that many of the people dont have the desition to chose their side
if they send you and you say no well thats not going to end well
He probably said Kiwi like the fruit (), I've heard that slur used sometimes for southamerican people
That was an pro independence war
Just like the philippines-US war
Apparently spain having colonies and fighting pro independence guerrillas was bad, but Americans having colonies and fighting pro independence guerrillas 1 year later is fine
Mmm maybe "machu", a few years ago was pretty popular to call them "Machupichus" because of a very popular TV show, and "machu" was a shorter term
I think it probably was "chipi" , I don't know what it means/why is said but I heard racists call people from South America this
Well yeah, there's a reason why Guardia Civil is not popular among young spanish people
Wanna know a "fun" fact about la manada case
It was not the first time they did something like that, absolutly scumbags
imagine judjing a police corp that has 78

I'd say a mixture of Mediterranean diet, Mediterranean weather, and Mediterranean culture, which involves warm friendly people and laid back attitude, which leads to less amounts of stress and depression
I don't think that climate is key, even though it helps
Parts of Spain have a weather more similar to Kazakhstan (exaggeration) than to Barcelona
And mountains, lots of them, same for Italy and Greece
And a huge part of Portugal is a rainy windshield
Maybe the higher amount of sunlight does it
Food contributes as well, but I'd say it's because of the quality (fresh food is much cheaper and easier to find), because in our modern stressed societies not many people follow a strict stereotypical Mediterranean diet, and in some regions it has never even been a thing
A more relaxed lifestyle
Hell no
Try our work culture and ethics and we'll see you fleeing back in a week
It sucks big time
To me, the main reason is a healthier culture when it comes to social interactions and more integration within everyday life
Although it happens too, the level of self isolation other cultures set up is unseen here
I'm generalising, but we don't need to schedule a meeting to socialize, or depend on alcohol consumption to do it
It's more spontaneous
It's overwhelming at times, but it helps preventing social issues and mental health problems
Also, even if for many reasons it's not optimal, our family oriented culture helps old people feel more accompanied and integrated, so they not are happier and are looked after better
Because we have exciting human interactions everyday and we eat better
Also our healthcare system is quite good and the weather invite us to be less sedentary
Something to bear in mind is that in Spain (think it’s the same in Italy) the northern regions, which I wouldn’t define as Mediterranean in terms of weather, diet or culture, actually have larger life expectancy than the proper Mediterranean regions
[Source in Spanish]
It’s way more complex, and just saying “mediterranean” is a bit of a blanket statement (not trying to be offensive here, apologies if it sounds like that)
I fully agree that society, family ties and attitude make a massive impact
However, I actually have some doubts on the impact of food
Spain is in the European average in terms of obesity, so we are not doing things that well in that field
Having very good healthcare, often better than in richer countries, helps a lot though (I am living in Ireland and how I wish our healthcare system was as thorough and competent as the Spanish
I would add that our culture makes us less prone to cut family ties and therefore if things go wrong you always have the support of your people emotionally and economically
We also have an amazing free (paid with taxes) healthcare
At least in the Spanish case we have a really good healthcare system too (I think it ranked behind Singapore and Hong Kong in a survey last year)
Also, it would be interesting to see how does life expentancy varies between each region (here in the North the Mediterranean diet is also rather foreign, and our climate is shittier than in the East or the South)
Wealth may be a factor to explain not differences with other countries but internal differences within the countries, though, don’t you think
In Spain there’s correlation, the regions with less GDP per capita have lower expectancy
The Basque Country, Navarra, Madrid
are at the top, whereas Ceuta, Melilla, Andalucía, Extremadura
are at the bottom of the list
Is it the same in Italy
And your dad sounds right
A couple of glasses of wine, great food and good company are medicine for the soul
The historical equivalent to your North is the Basque Country and Catalonia, as they're next to the French border
This industrial development, compared with the rest of Spain, was also another reason for the rising of independence movements in both regions
Let me guess, those "expats" you tell about went to the Canary Islands or Ibiza/Formentera
Spain's worklife is very stressful
Longer working hours (the mandatory rest for lunch in most companies makes the day way longer), low salaries, high unemployment and a bad work culture of just spending hours at work
Outside work, Spain is amazing, but inside it, it is pretty bad
So I don't think GDP is only due to hard work and stress, there are plenty of factors that affects it way more
I was amazed when I found out seguridad social covered my vasectomy
As my dad always says: we are beings of sun and water
Of course
Croatian seaside is a sort of heaven
Hahahahah well at least you're not in Finland
I see what you mean, but if we look at those standard wealth indicators, there’s a clear gap
Also, from a personal level, my financial situation here is way more comfortable that what would be with the same role in Spain (as for pretty much all qualified roles)
What you say makes sense but I have no problem in admitting that, by the usual measures, Ireland is a wealthier country than Spain at the moment
There’s a link in a comment below (actually a response to other of my comments) with data for Italy showing opposite conclusions, with most Northern Italian regions at the top for both sexes
Perhaps it’s wrong, no idea
I agree
Air pollution effect on life expectancy is something that is not discussed well enough
But not the other things
\+ /u/King_inthe_northwest
[Here's the data for Spain divided by regions] Esperanza de vida al nacer = Life expectancy at birth, Mujeres = Women, Hombres = Men
Honestly this doesn't seem to correlate with mediterranean diet or warm weather, Madrid is top and there's a extreme weather there (very hot in summer and very cold in winter)
We're also told it with the countries flipped, but referring to the Italian mentality (aka "progressiveness/open mind") rather than economic development
We don't have a Milano, but we don't have a Naples either (maybe Algeciras can qualify)
Oh, you are absolutely right
Being childless and without health issues makes me biased
Costs for both here are astonishing
My friends with kids in Spain laugh when we talk about childcare costs here
Makes sense thinking like that
Those blue zones are extremely lucky spots, but the averages tell a different story
Going off on a tangent, it’s a bit sad how we tend to focus too much on the Mediterranean image of countries as Italy or Spain while forgetting about the parts of the countries that don’t fall in the Mediterranean stereotype, which are quite often as interesting or even more
Don’t get me wrong, who could dislike Sicily or the Costa Brava, for example
but there’s way more to our countries
Sure, one thing does not cancel out the other
I also live in the North of Spain and although my region has low life expectancy in general quality of life is overall better here (the only thing lacking being the weather department)
Not wrong, the French system is not free (OTC), you have to pay for your appointments and you get a partial reimbursement of what you paid
Probably OP was referring to a single "universal" public system free for the user
I think we and the UK are the only ones having this kind of system
No, I'm not wrong it's multi-factor
You'll see many countries with one thing or the other but very few with all of them combined
Sorry, I meant economically when comparing the cities
I thought the North would be more progressive, I didn't know that
> Probably OP was referring to a single "universal" public system free for the user
I think we and the UK are the only ones having this kind of system
The Danish ~~and Swedish systems are~~ system is also beberidge-style and totally free
And a lot of other countries use a beberidge system, like Italy or Finland, I don't know if they have a copay or is also totally free, but i'm sure a lot of the other beberidge countries are also free
I understand that’s what OP meant but even considering that, I still feel like a majority of people gets more value from living in Ireland than in Spain
It’s a subjective appreciation, I may be wrong, and it depends a lot from where in the country you live in and your job, but it feels like the salary gap, which may actually be more noticeable in unqualified roles (minimum wage and lower tier salaries are almost double here, even considering the recent minimum wage raises in Spain) and the significantly lower % of taxes we pay in Ireland make up well for the increased cost of living
If it was the opposite, we’d have more Irish workers in Spain than vice versa
again, I may be wrong
Do you have any reading comprehension
Do you even understand what multi-factor even means
Shall we check the life expectancy in Poland
You have free healthcare but it's useless if the other factors are shit whereas if you have some of the other factors but a shitty healthcare or have to pay for an expensive insurance your life expentancy will also be lower
Oh sorry, I made a mistake with that, then
The danish one is free, though
Understood
I agree with your bias, that perspective is incorrect and leads to wrong political decisions
Let’s just summarize what I meant saying that raw economical data can be used to prove the thesis that Ireland is wealthier than Spain at the moment and that my personal experience leads me to think the thesis is right
Is that correct
The only thing I disagree with is the language barrier, it’s not symmetrical
Fully agree about the Irish side of it, but not the Spanish
Most young Spaniards with a decent level of education nowadays can speak enough English to, even if struggling the first few months with accents or needing some supplementary lessons upon arrival, be able to work unqualified jobs here
We are still mediocre at languages compared to you Scandinavians or Slavs
but the situation is not as horrible as a couple of decades ago
However, said that, I don’t like the stereotype of Spaniards (or Portuguese, or Italians, or eastern Europeans) moving abroad to wash dishes
Most of my Spanish acquaintances either here or in the UK come to work in engineering, research, industry
Some of them may have needed some unqualified income during the first months, until their English was fluent enough, but just as a first step
Spanish people without career aspirations often don’t last long away from home or don’t dare moving abroad
Exactly
I don’t even think we disagreed as such in the main topic
My picture as immigrant
you have it up there, but it’s true that I may have adapted better than average, so other people may give you a less rose tinted version
Who knows, in few years it could be me moving to Sweden
Anyway, thanks for your responses and all the best with the naturalisation
Nice to see some positivity
it's frankly refreshing
Not really but this seems funny
Do teachers comply
Hahah
AFAIK no, but I have a story
The last grade of high school (17-18 years old) usually ends like a month before the other grades, and some schools have a little graduation ceremony (I didn't go)
The year I graduated, my colleagues went drinking after the ceremony and actually showed up at school the next day, drunk, even though our classes were done
I was at school to get my certificate (they gave them at the ceremony but again, I wasn't there) and I first heard chanting and shouting, and then saw a bunch of teenagers dressed in formal clothing, completely drunk, invading the school halls while the teachers tried to kick everyone out
It was hilarious
I love this more now
Does this even happen in the university
Its funny
in American films they use Mexicans as Spaniards
But when an American  actor plays smart and tries to speak spanish you just go: I didn't understand anything xD
So I always wonder when they talk chinese, Russian or else, if they are really saying anything at all or just making noises for the American audience
It often comes off as very bad spanish and kinda takes me out of the movie
Usually with some thick american accent
I liked The Man Who Killed Don Quixote because they had most people speaking their native language and acting as their real nationality, so it was really natural and the accents when speaking other languages that werenn't their own didnt annoy me at all
They're using bows and arrows because Magneto can control metal (so he can control guns)
I kind of if like it if they show something of someone from Spain, but most of the time they put a mexican accent or use slangs from central/south america, so the moment is ruined
When did they speak Italian in HIMYM
Spain here, yes it is
Sometimes you even ask the route they're taking etc
Because you know,  being polite to someone who might help you in a rough environment is always helpful
Yeah, it usually is
But I do it mostly because I can't bring myself to look the other way after making eye contact, lol
People you pass in mountains or small villages are the only cases where I've seen consistent salutation here
Really
Where in Spain
I think that the words I repeat most throughout the day are hello and good morning
I've lived in a couple of cities in Spain (Barcelona and València) for 40+ years
Never heard anyone saying hello or good morning to people passing on the street unless it was someone they already knew
If it was in the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, it was probably "Adeu" ("Bye" in Catalan)
>For instance, films and TV shows in Poland have neither subtitles nor dubbing, instead we have one guy reading the script out loud as the movie goes
Like a poor man's version of dubbing with one guy reading all the lines in a monotone voice, I haven't seen anything like that anywhere else abroad
But why
Why not instead just have subtitles
If the guy is reading a translated version to Polish of the script, better then just save the money on the guy and don't that stupid thing and have subtitles

My father told me he was very surprised about how responsible young people are in that regard, when this year in my birthday party almost none of my friends wanted to have even a single beer because they all drove there (we're all in the mid 20s)
Apparently, back when he started driving (about 35 years ago), drunk driving was very common and not even frowned upon
The police would stop you, see you're wasted, and basically say "just drive carefully, okay
" and let you go
Hold up our 1hour late just because we can't never be on time
I would pay money to watch "[I think my father is the Krampus]
Thanks to botellones and the like, public drinking isn’t allowed here either
The police might (hah) turn a blind eye, but it is a heavily-fineable offense
It felt so surreal going to Germany, and seeing people chugging bottles of beer in the metro  o.O
How many wolves do they need to kill before they are accepted back home
What's the difference
That sounds reasonable and makes sense, thanks for making me understand why it exists
I mean, their point is to give established safe times to cross
If it is safe to cross at a non-established time
that’s up to you :)
That being said, I personally try to wait for the light to turn green unless I’m in a hurry or with others (initially because I can’t expect others to do it if I don’t, but now out of sheer habit)
Although I do have a non-negotiable exception to my exceptions: it doesn’t matter how much of a hurry I’m in, if a light is the kind you press for it to turn green, and someone pressed the button, you better believe I’m going to root my ass to the ground until it turns green
It makes my blood boil to see someone push the button and immediately cross the road
I hate that I do this myself (bad habits die hard if you don’t put your heart into it)
But honest moment
Even if we were to correct our timezone, people would still probably have late lunches
Because habit
I have friends who find having lunch before 14 inconceivable and very European

"No me cuentes cuentos chinos"
"Don't Tell me chinese tales"
It's used when you acuse someone of making excuses
In Spain we call "turk heads" to people who is accused of something they didn't do to favor the ones who
did it
That also happens in Spain, except that everybody agrees on what portion of the groceries they'll but each, so that it's fair for everybody, that way there's no need to send any pay requests and everybody is still happy
We call it ~~"Brasileña"~~ Cubana lol
We call that *sentarse al estilo indio* (to sit Indian style)
so we can conclude that it comes from the time Cuba was spanish
interesting
Gus Fring from Breaking Bad speaking Spanish: [
He doesn't sound like someone who speaks Spanish, let alone a native speaker (Gus is supposed to be a Chilean)
Every time Shakira sings in Spanish
I get half of what she says
In Breaking Bad, whenever Gus Fring speaks Spanish
Many times I had to turn on subtitles to understand what he was saying
Most "Spanish speakers" in the series have a weird non native pronunciation, but Gus' accent can barely be called an accent
If you consider Latin American Spanish and Spanish from Spain the same language, tons of times
I had a Canarian friend and Sometimes when he stepped in the gas
i had no idea what he was saying
It happens almost every day if you live in the South of Spain: most of the foreigners expect us to speak some English, French or German, but some of them try to speak a bit of Spanish with locals
Sometimes we can understand them, sometimes we cannot
[Galician
Yeah
It also happened to other characters, sometimes played by actors with Spanish speaking background and good accents
Quite often, their lines looked like direct translations from English that didn't sound natural, although they might be grammatically correct
For example, in the video you have linked the Mexicans say "la DEA está fuera de límites", which was probably written first in English as "DEA is off-limits". I understand what they mean in Spanish, and the grammar is right, but I wouldn't have chosen those specific words to say that we aren't allowed to do something (killing a DEA agent in this example)
I understand that "Spanish heritage speakers" that have grown up in the US often mix up both languages, but in this example the Mexicans are supposed to live in Mexico
Of course, I may be wrong and perhaps people from Mexico say "fuera de límites", but that isn't something you'd hear in Spain
I don't think this is a big deal, it's just that it caught my attention when I watched the show and I think it's interesting
Actually I thought the same with Better call Saul actor Michael Mando
You can tell he doesn't speak Spanish and the few scenes with his father your can see how the other actor is fluent and Mando just learned his sentences
No one commented anything about the Narcos actor who played Pablo Escobar and even though it's obvious that he's Brazilian his Colombian accent was remarkable
Not perfect but he worked really hard
"Breaking Bad" was the very first example that came to my mind
I understand tho, it must be near impossible getting a single Spanish-speaker in the US to help with translations and pronunciation, let alone acting
Isn't the Lleida accent also very thick
Breaking Bad: Gus is supposed to be Chilean, but his Spanish is clearly not Chilean
Nor any other Spanish spoken country
The actor speaks very slow and with a strong Anglo-Saxon accent
To be fair regarding the slang, since he is constantly working with people from Mexico and no Chileans, it’s perfectly reasonable that he would deliberately refrain from using regional words
As a Spaniard when I speak to Latin Americans, I know they won’t understand certain words so I try not to use them (for instance I will say “baño” instead of “servicio
Well, I guess it's the same if you hear an australian or a southerner from the US with a thick accent and using slang words
Or if an american hears someone from a small town of Scotland using slang words
I mean no one commented in this thread
Honestly, I don't think it was bad, I have Colombian friends and I think they just wanted a Colombian actor so nothing else would have worked for them (I can understand, I've seen more actors playing a Spaniard with Mexican accent than I can count)
But I think the guy really worked hard and all in all was a great Escobar
¿So was their Swedish as fake as their blond hair
The funny thing is, that a McDonalds manager here in Spain can earn more money than some graduates after the same time
Here people outright say that if you don't study you won't get any job
In my house it was "loading concrete sacks into trucks". Probably customized for me, since I'm very physically lazy
It worked, I studied computer science
There's also that tongue-in-cheek one, that if you don't study you'll end up as a "Guardia Civil".
That we are not a bunch of bullfighters, flamenco dancers and lazy fucks who sleep siesta from 3 to 5 PM
Siesta must be done from 3 to 7 PM, everyone knows that
I was asked in the subway by some American tourists where they could get the best Spanish traditional tacos
Also, our tortillas is nothing like the Mexican ones (they're omelettes)
Almost everytime I talk to an american and I say that I am from Spain, I have to explain that:
\- We are not mexicans and we don't speak like in soap operas
\- Spain is in Europe (Some of them get really amazed when I tell them ''we are just south of france'')
\- No, we don't (usually) like spicy food
\- No, I don't have italian or french ancestry, people in Spain are usually white because, spoiler: there are rainy days here too
\- Aaand no, weather isnt always great
Ir isn't wierd to be spanish and have pale skin and blue eyes
We aren't dancing " flamenco " all day
I mean, you have ladders right
I'd add that we are not doing fiesta 24/7, only most of the time, when we are not sleeping
I didn't know people ate reindeer meat

By the way, this is not pretty common in English, as they had the great idea of adding the word ''new'' to any city that was founded with the same name as one that existed previously

I don't support mandatory vaccination
I think educating people to get their vaccines and prohibiting un-vaccinated to attend public schools are better for ensuring that people are vaccinated
Forcing people to do something just seems wrong
I support it
Vaccination should be mandatory except for those who can't for health reasons
People will find a way around it, only education will solve anti-vaxxing
Here in Spain lots of anti-vaxxers just fake their papers with even the help of (PUBLIC
) anti-vax doctors, it's really stupid at this point
In my opinion it should be mandatory, on top of that I would not even let people in the country if they don't proof to be vaccinated
(For the EU it would be impossible, but for the rest they must)
Whats the worst/funniest english translation you've seen in your country
Mine
In a beach restaurant i once Saw "rape a la marinera" (seaman style monkfish) translated as seaman style rape
There was an awful translation in a restaurant in my hometown that became viral few years ago
A quite popular one pot stew of my area (although there’s few other variants across Spain) with several kinds of meat, vegetables and chickpeas is named ‘cocido leonés’. Leonese stew would be a reasonable translation
What did the restaurant translate it to
‘Cooked lions’
I saw in a local bar "cola cao" (the national chocolate powder beverage) translated as "tail cao" to English :P
Lol, it's donut or berlina here, a Berliner is a berlinés.
I haven't read much about it but I got a notification from the Euronews app about it, congrats
Now is your perfect oportunity to finally restore the khaganate
Does this mean that there's going to be a transition to democracy or some democratising reforms
Because they (the party/junta/whatever) might simply appoint a new dictator and keep things like they used to
>Bonus question: Would you support the idea of European Las Vegas
A few years ago Eurovegas was a project that was being discussed and it was theorized that it would be built in the south of Madrid, in a city near where I live
Most people disliked the idea
It would've created a lot of employment, sure, but the general sentiment that people had around here was that it would only cause trouble
I don't remember why it didn't become real though
I think they decided to go to Asia or something
I live in a small town in the Mediterranean coast
Usually our pop
is 25k\~, and in summer its 3 times that number
And I can guarantee you that almost everyone new here during summer are tourist (the rest are ppl with summer houses), and I can understand why they are trying to change their image (not like I don't like tourism, its our main source of income AND usually its a new way to met new people), but most of the time, the tourist are drunktards that are always drinking, smoking, and trashing literally every place, from disco to cultural places
Not to talk of the people that literally comes to commit crimes (yes, there are thousands of cases of drunk people destroying properties, puking and leaving their trash everywhere, or even raping
By the way, did I mention the balconing
A practice that kills several thousands every year
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I think they are just doing fine whit that image change
Bonus answer: Yes, definitely
Anything made together with other Europeans would be awesome
I'm in Ibiza right now
No party this year (not as it uses to be) but Ibiza has a lot more to offer
Anyway I don't think Ibiza's clubbing fits that well in that 'party-destination to get wasted' definition like Magaluf does, for example
You pay 60€ to enter a club, a small bottle of water is over 10€. This is not the place to cheap-partying
You don't come here to get wasted, and if you come for that you have a huge pocket so nobody will care
Ibiza here
I have mixed feelings because massive Party tourism is pretty annoying but a lot of people (including my family) live off this
Take into account that before tourism Ibiza was extremely poor and isolated, but if people behave It would be better
I live in Benidorm (cheap ibiza) and I don’t really mind that our population is 8 times bigger in summer, also is like playing gta irl
I'm studying tourism and I can tell you that every year we are told how they try to promote ibiza in a different way
But in reality, they just want to be less dependent of it, while still getting all the money it gives them
There are more alternatives now
Maybe some extra laws to reduce noise and regulate people, but nothing has changed much
I think only Spanish people do different stuff
Old people and families, while the young and the international tourists keep doing parties
I'm a teenager from Barcelona, the top 1 touristic destination in Spain (in number of visitors)
My parents work in the sector, so I know some things about the issue
Here, luckily, we have many kinds of tourists
There are people with a lot of money who come here to visit as much as they can, low and middle class families that spend their holidays and
Drinking tourists
They drink, go out every night, piss in the street, sleep in the street, scream, play music wherever they want (loudly and at night, especially)
Edit: Have I mentioned "balconing" is a real thing these tourists do
It's really funny
They jump from a building's first or second floor to a swimming pool
Of course, the latter are the fewer, but they're also the louder
Because of that, citizens from Barcelona are getting mad at all tourists, and they want to regulate even more the sector
Most drinking tourists are British, so maybe there will be less people like that after Brexit
Sadly, I think this is a problem we'll never get ripped off
Edit: About Eurovegas (the project started, I think), I think it would be nice to have all those people in one spot, away from cities
Great that they are trying to move away from it, but I wouldn't say that specific type of tourism has too much of an affect on the locals unless you live in the areas where it's really popular
I live about a 10 min drive from Magaluf but you wouldn't know it, the type of people that go to Magaluf or Playa de Palma don't tend to explore much so we just never go to those places in summer
Party tourism tends to be very localised, Mallorca is bigger than Ibiza but it isn't huge, yet there is soo much more to see than Magaluf
The biggest difference I've noticed is the lack of mass tourism, obvious given the circumstances, but it's been like an unexpected breath of fresh air
For a collective population on the islands of around 1 million people we had 16
5 million tourists last year, the majority between June and September
Almost any beach you go to or vaguely attractive town is rammed with tourists but this year, for a short period at least, we could enjoy those places just for ourselves
Even this year a lot of the popular places are busy with tourists again, just not to the ridiculous levels of usual
So in my opinion changing the type of tourism would be nice but the main issue is unsustainable tourism growth, which I'm sure is the same in pretty much all the places OP mentioned
The problem is, at least in the case of the Baleares, the local industry has come to rely so much on tourism that without it, or even in lower numbers than usual, a good portion of business would just collapse
**TL;DR** Better tourism would be nice but less mass-tourism better
Opinion will vary depending on whether your business relies on this
Mallorca has only land to plant some fruits and vegetables, fishes and tourists
We could survive without tourists, but we would live way worse
The plan didn't work not because some people disliking it but because they wanted a waiver from the Spanish general legislation in some aspects (e.g. They wanted to allow smoking inside) and that was a no-no
I agree with you
Just wanted to mention that several thousands death every year from balconing is a humongous exaggeration
According to Wikipedia, in 2018, there was 6 balconing incident, and 3 deaths
We speak a dialect of catalan called Eivissenc
If you know someone here you can go to places only known to locals, Who are way better than the crowded tourist areas
Most of them are in the north (Sant Joan, Sant Miquel Etc
Yep
I had been multiple times to Amsterdam, but last year was my first visit to Rotterdam and I loved every minute of it
In all honesty, I can't recall the details, but the general consensus was the proposal in general sounded shady as fuck
Besides, It came in a time when lots of corruption cases linked to PP went public, and some notable figures of the party endorsed a Spanish Eurovegas like crazy
They also wanted difference labor laws allowing people for working a lot of hours for little money, that was illegal for Spanish and European laws
I don’t really think that creating employment form tourism is our best choice
I think it’s one of the various reasons our economy and society are like they are
Just take a look at all of the coast in the south, where most of the people live from tourism
It has ended up being the area with more unemployment and poverty
Sure, people that own the hotels are probably rich, but the medium person is not
I’m not sure what would be the solution, maybe industry, but definitely not tourism
Yeah, I exaggerated it a bit x)
Also look at how are we now post-lockdown
We are in the same situation than in March but we're not closing borders and quarantining a bit harder because that would mean the small profit we're making from tourism would go to shit and our economy can't afford that
Sure tourism gives a lot of money and faster than other sectors, but we're fucked now for relying on that
Yeah I know, that's my complain
Spain has been relying on tourism too much for too long and now we're going to see the consequences of building an economy around it
I don't know, we do have production and manufacturing though but maybe not as big as other countries
Tourism has always been the big, fast way to make money here and manufacturing, research and production are slower forms of making money
And any efforts on making those bigger and better get pushed aside, because to see actual benefits to it you need 4 years or more, and that doesn't get you votes in an election
The country needs money, it gets it from tourism, so why bother would you bother in other sectors
Massive tourism as one of our biggest forms of income started during Franco's dictatorship to try make Spain look better to the rest of the world I believe
And from there we just went with it I guess
It's a fast source of money, it also helped to develop a big industry around construction (which was the primary cause of the 2008 crisis in Spain)
But now I'm stepping in something I don't know too much about so take all of these with a grain of salt
We're doing fine, other years we've been at >40° in June in my city, this year we didn't reach >35° yet so it's pretty nice
Everyone bitching while we have been getting 30-35°C in summer every year Lmfao
This week I’ve finally gotten used to the scorching temperature indoors :)
Living in the north of my country
Having a nice 17-19ºC today
I'm in Murcia and today I felt like my skin was melting
every summer i contemplate the idea of moving up north
Which part do you live in
I feel like this year isn't as hot either, usually our poorly insulated house gets to like 28 in the summer, but it stays at 24ªC.
iirc, it's quite humid in the UK, which makes heat unbearable
Besides, the UK doesn't (didn't) usually get this hot, so neither they, nor their building styles are used to it
Actually that last bit is important
Their houses (along with northern Europe's in general) are built to *retain* heat, whereas ours (AUS and ESP) are designed to *repel* heat
Heck, until sometime last week, I myself was dying in 28º *indoors*, because I hadn't gotten used to it yet
Being spanish I don't get it neither
Like, old people and workers literally die here in summer, why on earth people call this "good weather", I'd rather be at <0°
Same here(Spain), it feels like summer started 2 months ago and now we are entering hell season
The comment was a joke, obviously, as for me these temperatures have been the standard all my life so I just do the same every time, turn on the AC or a Fan
What isn't a joke is wasting water
Where I live, in the south of Spain, water is not something you can waste like it's nothing, I go to a little city on the coast in summer to spend the time near the beach and every time I'm walking around and see water spilled on the ground I get angry as heck, mainly because I know that the ones that have spilled the water are either not from this region or just from a country located more to the north because clearly they don't value water enough, also that city has only one method for getting drinkable water, a machine that removed the salt from seawater or whatever and that is already almost not enough for all the small city
Value water
Step 1: Having always lived in an area that gets dry-hot /s
But seriously though, nothing groundbreaking
- Cross ventilation
- Maximise the cooler times of the day:
- I lower my shutters to about 3/4ths at around 12-14 ish to avoid the sun getting in
The hotter the day is predicted to be, the lower it gets, but do try to let some air come in
However on particularly hot days, I lower it completely, ventilation be damned
- Completely opening the shutters and the windows at night to let cooler air come in
- I have a small industrial floor fan pointing upwards that can practically create its own mini-hurricane
I personally prefer pointing the fan up, not directly at me, but you do you
- Additionally, I have a cheap hand fan in case things get too unbearable
- Starting next week, I'm probably going to bring down the toldos (awnings
) because the above starts failing when it gets too hot
- If we get into the 40º region, I'll probably be forced to turn on the aircon
Sillier things:
- Water is (obviously) your best friend
I always have two jugs of water cooling in the fridge (I do this year-round, though, so meh)
Spraying on water like you are in a photoshoot helps too; I try to make it as erotic as possible, just to get a chuckle out of the situation :P
- I am personally fortunate enough to be able to reorganise my schedule to have a quick siesta in the afternoon
Yeah, here too
About 2 weeks ago it was cold (compared to the weather before) so people went back to wearing jackets and not leaving the house too much, and then it slowly got warmer and it's like summer now (tho not as hot as other years honestly), and it hailed and stormed the other day
It's like the weather has commitment issues
Yeah "guiris" love spanish sun, that's why make fun of their red burned skins :D
Seriously, even I get burned easily in Spain if I don't use sunscreen, what make Northern europeans believe they can deal with spanish sun
It's like going to Russia in January with just a t shirt and a hoodie
Spain is a great country to visit, but if you come in summer you better take some sunscreen and drink a ton of water if you don't want to die
As a Spanish we also have the same problem
This is due to the fact that industrialisation happened near the big cities, which consist of the Eastern coast, the North and south, and the capital
While the interior is heavily agricultural
Because of that, people emigrated to these industrial cluster
Leaving their villages in search of work opportunities
Many villages became abandoned, or have an old population
It still happens nowadays but not as exaggerated as it used to be
We can still feel the effects of it
It is very common that some families travel to the interior of the country in what we call "irse al pueblo" (going to the village)
This consist of spending usually a few days in the village where your grandparents and other family members live, and then going back to the city
I hope this helps you understand
It might not be the same situation as your country, but it might give you an idea of what might be the problem
As a Canadian, I feel no connection what so ever to the United Kingdom
As a Spaniard, I feel no connection what so ever to Latin-American countries
As a Spanish-Canadian, I feel like I don't 100% belong in either place
My experiences growing up in both countries are way different than any of my local Spanish friends or Canadian family, so it's hard to relate
I would want to read this for sure
"Children come with a loaf of bread under their arms" means newborns bring joy in Post-War Spanish
When you are a lucky person, on Spain people say that you are born with a flower in your ass
Or, when you are saying that children bring joy, you say that children are born with a loaf of bread under their arms
In Spain when a child is born and its followed by good events we say "the was born with a bread loaf under his arm"
you forgot dutch
Every si gle tourist invaded town in the spanish mediterranean
Kilometres of same looking tourists houses and resorts along the coast lf artificial beaches
The best example might be benidorm or Torrevieja
The spanish mediterranean (from barcelona to valencia) is a very good example of how tourism can make places ugly
Most Spanish cities have an area that was developed during Franco or a bit after between 1955 and 1985 that is completely trash: tall buildings very close to each other
Those buildings look dubiously constructed and they are shit inside, no natural light, cold in winter and hot during the summer
Corrupt developers ensured they didn’t have to allow for green spaces, parks of other services
Large parts of Spanish cities lack access to green areas in those developments
The examples in Granada, my home town (which is a fairly pretty and touristic city) would be: La Chana, el Zaidín or Camino de Ronda
Parla was voted ugliest city of Spain a few years ago
Haven't been there but if It won against Puertollano
It has to be ugly
In Spain its said to be Parla but ive been there and I dont think its that bad honestly
God
that shit in photos induces depression
Who thought of building It
It is so strange and sad to think about that
Even if it has never really been a visually pleasing city, worrying about artillery shelling really is a whole different level than complaining about ugly city centers
Hope the situation gets better for you guys soon
For a while I wanted to visit Donetsk and eastern cities in Ukraine
Is it possible for a tourist to enter Donetsk with the current situation
Benidorm is a good example of (spontaneous) environmentally responsible tourism:
1) It doesn’t take a lot of land, being developed vertically
2) It allows for many budgets to afford a beach destination
It’s not Dubai or Santa Monica where the rich have single homes
3) It consumes less water/electricity per person than single homes
4) It costs less to tax payers to maintain, as the tourist population, that comes mainly during the summer doesn’t pay taxes to fund things like garbage collection and local police and that would be difficult to provide in a more spread out model
So, despite its ugliness, Benidorm is equitable and environmentally friendly
Why are we Andalusians always excluded when we talk about the Mediterranean
Everyone knows that the Mediterranean reaches the Pillars of Hercules in Cadiz and then the earth ends, in a great black vortex that spits out everything that falls on it over the Caribbean
Pablo Alborán sings very well, but he doesn't deserve to have a sea with his name #AndaluciaEsMediterranea
También te digo que Lleida, Vigo o Eibar son desproporcionadamente más feas que Salou, Santa Pola o Gandía
I've been to chiatura
It has a special vibe
postapocalyptic
It's so ugly and tacky and it lavks all sorts of charm
It's an eyesore for my soul
You're prettier though, it's not that massive apart from Malaga city and Torremolinos
Hahahaha
Your elderly seem to love retiring here
They never speak spanish though
Prueba Parla, Puertollano y Fuenlabrada
I thought Vigo was quite ugly
Buffff
No se yo, eh
Con lerida la verdad que estoy de acuerdo, no se me había pasado por la cabeza
Vigo no se
Igual es que es entorno natural me engaña
Yes, I expected it to be difficult
Thanks a lot
Nos han programado para pensar que proveer de vacaciones a la clase trabajadora es feo y no tiene clase
Mientras, vemos documentales de casas fantásticas en calas preciosas que valen millones de euros
Si Benidorm fuera así, ¿cuánta gente se podría permitir unas vacaciones en la playa
Si quieres sitios salvajes y bien protegidos todavía hay lugares como Cabo de Gata que son fantásticos y puedes ir a acampar
. El norte entero o cadiz no son para elites y son mucho más bonitos
La simple realidad es que el mediterraneo se lo han cargado a golpe de urbanización cutre y hortera
Bueno, nadie te fuerza a hacer las vacaciones allí.
Honestly If you think about it, USA is so overrated
My theory is that peopel in Europe take less sugar, or rather than people in the USA take wayy too much sugar
Excessive sugar can cause abrupt mood swings
[heres a map of sugar intake]
[Sugar worsens mood rather than improving it]
from what i've heard, they use something called "Corn Syrup" and put it in almost anything you can think off, because its a cheap substitute of sugar since its subsidized
so even burger buns have this corn syrup thing
Article 1
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of
law, which advocates as the highest values of its legal order, liberty, justice, equality and
political pluralism
National sovereignty is vested in the Spanish people, from whom emanate the powers
of the State
The political form of the Spanish State is that of a parliamentary monarchy
Good thing we have a version [published in English] because I can barely even understand legal texts, let alone translate them
Anyway:
**Article 1**
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of law, which advocates as the highest values of its legal order, liberty, justice, equality and political pluralism
National sovereignty is vested in the Spanish people, from whom emanate the powers of the State
The political form of the Spanish State is that of a parliamentary monarchy
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of law, which advocates freedom, justice, equality and political pluralism as highest values of its legal system
Well it's kinda nice
That’s why (article 1
3) it’s officially the Kingdom of Spain
Not really
Trust me, a lot of people try and have tried
I think it's more because of our long history of absolute monarchies and dictatorships, in which the governor got absolutely all the power
We are still a monarchy, but the king does not have that much power
We vote, (and that way the sovereignty is on us), and we elect a president/party to govern
Technically yes, but this, and the rest of the articles dealing with the Crown are protected, which means the procedure for reform is incredibly hard
An old woman approached me in Venice when I was like 16  she gave me 10€, smiled, and then she left
I went on a school trip to Paris when I was 16
Just four days, but I got plenty of weird stories:
* The first day, we arrived at the hotel and the very first thing we saw was two guys having a physical fight right in front of the entrance
* A boy got food poisoning from a bottle of water he had bought from a street vendor
* We visited Montmartre and some random black guy asked my friend (who had dreadlocks) to take a selfie with him
* The same guy had to share a room with me and another boy and the first night it was late and we didn't know where he was
He knocks at the door at 3am, comes in, says "hey I'm kinda high", slips on the floor, falls to the ground, gets up, eats and entire bag of cookies he had on his backpack, then gets in the bed and falls asleep
* My schoolmates and I were coming out of the subway station near the Moulin Rouge and the street was so crowded there was a woman riding an electric scooter and couldn't really move
She accidentally hit one of my classmates with her scooter several times and didn't even realize
Then the boy started shouting at her in Spanish
Turns out she could understand Spanish and the first thing I see is a furious woman shouting "I SPEAK SPANISH JUST LIKE YOU" with a heavy French accent
And I got even more stories lol
Last Spring, I had just arrived to Munich when a guy in Marienplatz talked to me about something in German
I don’t speak German so I didn’t listen to him, and then he started yelling at me when he saw I wasn’t paying him attention hahaha it was very funny
* One evening we were sitting outside of a restaurant with our teachers, waiting for the rest of our classmates to finish their dinner when we saw a delivery guy riding his moped on the sidewalk
One of our classmates (he's hella weird tbh) pointed at him and said WHAT IS HE DOING
and the guy got off his moped and started to yell at the boy and our teachers, then tried to fight them while yelling I SPEAK SPANISH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY
* Some random guy in the subway heard my friend speaking Spanish and got really close to her, then said 'hola, española'. My friend is the most Slavic-looking Pole ever
* It was a girl's birthday so someone started singing Happy Birthday out loud in the metro on our way back to the hotel and the entire class started singing too while I cringed silently
Then they decided Happy Birthday wasn't enough so they started to sing Christmas music even if it was June and some random drunk guy started singing while holding as my classmates were singing
To top it all off the day we were going back home we had to face the most French problem ever: air traffic controllers on strike
Our flight was delayed but even that was funny lol
It was an unforgettable trip, and I also had the chance to meet an internet friend, which was a great experience
The bottle was probably kept in anti hygienic conditions
I just stayed in Granada in a flat shared with other tourists
My bf and I had a room for ourselves and we paid 10€ per person, so it does have its advantages
Obviously, it wasn't remotely fancy, but it worked out fine
There was also a big white cuddly cat :3
Streets full of drunk teenagers
(Botellón) New year without a couple of teens having ethyl comas is not a decent new year's eve
The guy in the fountain surrounded by two girls had the night of his life
Probably Andalucía. A mostly rural region with a very high population, which means unemployment is rampant these days as most people cant make a living out of farming
Add a poor industrial network to the mix and you have a really hard place to get a decent job
Still an incredibly beautiful and historically rich region tho
Andalucía, they deserve so much more
I'm surprised at my fellow Spaniards claiming it's Andalucía. At least there things such as industry, tourism or actual cities exist
Sure there are bad zones like Algeciras but that's all about it
Even the poorer is not Andalucía (which is in fact one of the richest regions) but Extremadura, which got the poorest people, the poorest town of the whole country, etc
Melilla on the other hand though
absolutely crime driven to a level nowhere seen in any other place of the country, 0 opportunies, separated from the mainland
I personally feel sorry for Galicia, in northern Spain
It's such a beautiful land full of amazing people
They used to be a rich independent Kingdom, both Portugal and portuguese language are direct descendents of the Kingdom of Galicia, and old galician was a very important langauge in the Middle Ages in the iberian peninsula
But now it's just a poor and abandoned region, and not even their own autonomic politicians care about Galicia
I would say Extremadura is worse and more abandoned
>A mostly rural region
Bruh every region in Spain is heavily urbanized, and Andalusian 'towns' are usually quite big
The main issue in Andalusia is the lack of jobs because the industry went downhill
What about Teruel
Probably the most abandoned province in Spain
Una polla
Yeah sorry mate, you're wrong on this one
In comparison with the North, Andalucía is rural, it has big cities, but a lot of its population works the land, im not saying that there is not industry, but is one of the less industrialized regions in Spain in relation to its area
The main issue with Andalusia is that there has never being a significant industry to begin with
The region was in decadence for two centuries before it began to have any significant revival in the late 20th century
Aragon in general, with the two Castilles are quite bad at that level
And Andalucia has big cities, tourism and everybody knows it
Ceuta and Melilla aren't paradises either
What North
The problem of Andalusia is definitely lack of industry but not comapred to its area but to its population and to how urban it is
Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha have a similar area to Andalusia
Those are rural regions, not Andalusia
Andalusia has 3 of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in Spain and a population a million bigger than Catalonia
Ok, I wasnt clear enought
By "the North" I mean Green Spain, wich is by far the most industrialized part
Of course, there are regions in Spain way more rural than Andalucía, but there is few people living there, like Teruel
The problem with Andalucía is its huge population, thats the big deal, it wouldnt be such a bleeding problem if Andalucia had a small population, but there is 8,5 million people living there
Probably a lot of you know about this, but I feel like a lot of people think we were neutral in WW1 and WW2 because we just didn't care or something
Before WW1, we had had a lot of civil wars, most notably "Las Guerras Carlistas" and between WW1 and WW2 we had our civil war, from 1936 to april 1939, so yes, we were not going to join another war just 5 months later
We were destroyed inside
A lot of people were enemies within the families, Spain was divided in two, and we were in a dictatorship and in poverty
We were not able to join (although Franco tried to be allies with Hitler)
Los reyes magos in Spain, it's like Santa Claus but here is more popular
That's a very mild civil war
We never learnt about it in school
On the other hand, we had our own heretic movement with ties to Protestantism called the *alumbrados* (enlightened ones)
It was limited to the urban elites of a bucnh of important cities and it was brutally suppressed by the Inquisition so it didn't have a lasting influence
But it is there
Plus there were spanish volunteer troups on both sides too
The spanish troup was the first one to go to liberate Paris if i recall correctly
But the main reason we didn’t fight in WWI was because we lost a huge share of our economy due to the American-Spanish War and the loss of Cuba; then, Eduardo Dato decided to not enter the war and instead, just provide both sides of the conflict with food, clothes and whatmore
The problem, again, came back because we sold so much food outside that our population didn’t have enough to eat
I've been studying the first decades of the XX century in Spain
Man it feels like a super exciting adventure-politics-Game of Thrones series
I literally stood up when I read how the Second Republic was proclaimed
Spain's history is just full of interesting details and interactions, and some events have famous paintings related to them which only makes it x100 more shocking
For example (wikipedia images linked),  ["The Second of May 1808"] by Francisco de Goya illustrates the popular protests people did in 1808 against the presence of French troops in the streets (Spain was getting invaded by good ol' Napoleon)
Also, my personal favorite, ["The Third of May 1808"] by the same author, shows the shootings the police and the troops perfomed the day after against the protestors
I could go on for days
Francisco de Goya did A LOT of this shit and honestly I love all of it
Also the Spanish-American War between the Carlist Wars and the Civil War
I actually know of it
So interesting
I do remember learning about it, as it's part of our history, but i don't really remember anything specific about it
Yes, that's true
I just wrote what came to my mind first
Lucky you that can see our history like something beautiful and enjoyable
I need to study all the Spanish history (since prehistoric times) for selectividad (the university entrance exam) and I'm hating it
It's not that I don't like history, but the way we have to memorize everything to the smallest unimportant and uninteresting details is horrible
I wish I could enjoy it more
But you are right: XX century is a lot better but I have fallen asleep in class with other eras
Hey we're on the same page, I'm also about to do the selectividad in a month
Good luck on your exams, man, I hope you do great
IDRK in what subject/autonomous community they make you learn all that crap, but it sure as hell sucks
In my Spanish history subject we're only seeing centuries XIX and XX
Honestly before those i'm not interested at all either
I'm doing the Science bachelor so my hell is prolly different than yours
But hey, it's a bad month ahead of you, once you get it done, you never have to worry about the visigoths or Al-Andalus ever again
Be strong, you got this
This goes for me too lmao
Ohh cool
Good luck too
I have finished my exams, it's only selectividad left
I'm doing sciences too, but here (Madrid) spanish history is mandatory and he'll to all sciences students (and basically everyone)
At least I like the maths, physics and chemestry, but I'm with you, it's difficult (although I find it more difficult to study history than any other subject, except spanish literature history)
You're so lucky to have only XIX and XX centuries
I would pay for that, man
What community are you from
(It's ok if you don't want to answer, but I'm curious
You can dm me if you want)
Only one month left, yaaay
I want to finish this shit once and for all
We are almost there
Un último empujón y lo tenemos
Here (Comunidad Valenciana) spanish history is mandatory too, but I believe it's approached differently depending on your bachelor
I don't know why we start on the XIXth century though, I guess we did learn everything before that last year
For me, the whole history-literature thing is hard to sit down to, but once I get into it I get REALLY into it lmao
It's nice you enjoy maths, it's a burden not to like it
Also you were able to choose physics AND chemistry
Well shit I would have liked to do that but we had to choose from two options
You either took physics + technical drawing (what I did) or chemistry + biology
Oh well
Technical drawing is beautiful too, but it's way harder to *understand* than anything else
Our teacher sometimes motivates us by talking about "a new phase in your lives" and "getting the fuck out of highschool after all this time" and it honestly works for me
Here in sciences you have two options: biosanitario (includes chemestry + biology + physics/geology as optatives) and tecnológico (chemestry + physics + industrial technology/technical drawing as optatives)
At least it's like this in my highschool, because it's pretty big, but maybe in others it's different
And maybe it's also because I'm not doing only the Spanish Baccalaureate, so they adapt the subjects to the other Baccalaureate
Yo estoy haciendo tecnológico con tecnología industrial, porque en primero tuve que hacer dibujo técnico y me costó bastante
Eso sí, es precioso
Me gustaría haberlo hecho si no fuera porque iba a tener que estudiar 10 veces más que en tecnología, y no iba a tener tiempo (haciendo dos bachilleratos a la vez y tal
Perate estás haciendo dos bachilleratos a la vez
Madre mía estás bien
Mi instituto es bastante pequeño, o sea es de un pueblo de 8000 habitantes, así que muchas optativas no se llegan a cursar porque se la han pedido 4 en total
Si no se mete bastante gente, no se cursa
Por eso en teoría tenemos la optativa de tecnología pero nadie sabe cómo es ni nadie la ha visto en su vida
Como el 60% de la gente se metió a informática y el resto a francés. Somos unas basic bitches
Yo el año pasado me metí al biosanitario, con biología en vez de dibujo (esa era la única diferencia lol) y este año me he cambiado, con lo que tengo Dibujo Técnico I pendiente
Oh well
Buena decisión, biología según algunos amigos míos es empollar y empollar y empollar, ya te tiene que gustar para no pegarte un tirito
La verdad es que dibujo técnico es to bonito y es de las que mejor se me dan, pero como no entiendas algo cuesta mucho remontar
Tecnología solo dimos en 2º de la ESO e hicimos el típico [puzzle] con formas que se puede resolver de varias maneras
Buena experiencia pero ahí se quedó.
Using a restaurant's or a bar's toilet as a passer-by that won't buy a thing, instead of as a customer
Spaniard living in the USA
In Spain I would say having lunch before 1pm or dinner before 8pm
You can do it, of course, but we will say you are having a brunch or a snack
And some restaurants are not even open for lunch or dinner before 12
30pm or 8pm unless you are visiting a very turisty area
And in the USA I would say no tipping in a restaurant
Technically legal, but feels illegal
Even if you just tip 10% or less seems like you are gonna be a terrible person
Some places, when you pay with card, shows in the screen 4 options to tip: 15%, 18%, 20%, or 'Other', so if you wanna tip 10%, you have to click other and enter the percentage while feeling observed
I'm glad in Spain we only tip if we felt like the service was good and they deserved it
Bonus: As a valencian, making any yellowish rice with things and call it paella
Well, you can do it, is legal, but it feels so wrong for us
Mixing coke and wine (kalimotxo, it has to be spelled a bit dangerously) is legal and drunk by plenty of teenagers (including me) but it feels bad after certain age
In Spain asking for free tap water is common and normal
Although the quality of the tap water varies a lot from town to town
> the country’s largest facility for "uneducable retards"
world's first reddit meetup
I am surprised it’s not actually trespassing lol
Oh wow, I much rather have takeaway or order food on mondays, when I have less time to cook and the week just started
I do feel like pizzas belongs to fridaya/saturdays tho
About the second, same with my dad
He always gets mad with that
I'm not sure that would be legal here
Ya, maybe it's more common in the south but it also dependsnif is weekday or weekend I guess
It turns out I knew how to cut the cheese (lol) without being French
Anyway it makes sense to get full taste, rim and center
It’s makes sense too how the size of the portion changes with how strong the cheese is
The payment thing
They can't demand a payment for a glass of water either
Not my language, but in Portuguese there’s the word “saudade” which could be loosely described as that feeling of longing someone or something
We use "¡" and "¿"to indicate the start of exclamative and interrogative sentences respectively
Ñ is a letter of our alphabet (it's not exclusive to Spanish, but is a very Spanish thing)
The only repeated double consonants are rr, ll, nn and cc
Rr and ll change the sound respect the single consonant
nn and cc are separated in different syllabes corrección-> co-rrec-ción
It's a phonemic language, feature that shares with Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Finnish, Czech, Polish and Latvian and some more
In spain we have a special word for smuggling and black markets called estraperlo, due to a scandal in the 30's. [
In Galician we also have a few stuff
* **morriña** \- kind of longing for your home and your people when you're abroad
"homesick"
* **Riquiño** \- comes from "rich" but means something like "small cutie" or "lovable".
* **Seica -** Contraction of "sei" (know) and "que" (that)
Equivalent of "seems like"
* **Daquela** \- Contraction of "de" and "aquela". Equivalent of "then" or "therefore"
We have lots of contractions that Spanish doesn't have aswell wich makes Galician feel more natural to speak and conversate imo
* Galician | Spanish
* da = de + la
* dos = de + los
* aos = a + los
* cun = con + uno
* cunha = con + una
“Mil” (thousand) is the only number in Spanish without an “o” or an “e”. All the rest have one of these vowels
We have the same but in arabic and latin
Olive is oliva (latin) and aceituna (arabic)
The way some words change meaning depending on where they have the strong syllable
"Abrazo" means hug
"Abrazó" means he/she hugged
Also our use of accents
In English, we have phrasal verbs
Basically a verb + particle(preposition) that takes the place of a phrase
Depending on the combination of verb and particle it can have many different definitions and or contexts
In spanish we say alá (allah) instead of god a lot of times without realising that is the same word
It might be not the only language in the world but i think is a good input
Can you explain what that is
"Rico" in Spanish can be cute/lovable too
Didn't know morriña was Galician because it's widely used by Spanish speakers too
Also I find weird that Andalusian have a lot of contractions too but it's seen as vulgar or wrong instead of a property of the language
In Spain we also use it, but the word is "Ahora" ( no sé poner cursivas :c )
\-illo, -ito, -ino, -ico in Spanish depending on the dialect
Edit: the word for this suffix in particular is "diminutive"
Japanese counting system is one of my nightmares as a student of the language
Ultimately I feel defeated, acknowledge that I'm just a gaikokujin, and use 『-つ』for mostly everything
That's a cool trick
Nah, even obscure basque features like Ergativity exists in languages like Georgian and others
He refers to the meaning of "later", which is weird as the word "ahora" means "now".
It's true, but in this case they aren't the same thing
Mosca is fly
We have mosquita for little flies and mosquitito for little mosquitos
Ohh I see
Cool
In summer, noon in my town is after 14:30
That's one of the most stupid things I have to bear
Don't care one or the other
But only one
I have a few weeks of confusion ahead because the light outside does not seem right, and I have to wake up one hour earlier than what my body tells me it is normal
My current coffee supply is not going to be enough
Definitely winter time
Spain is already in the wrong time zone so 11PM in summer is technically 9PM and it’s still very hot making sleeping difficult
Yeah, it usually takes 10 to 14 days for me until I do not notice the effects
Today it has been
bad
Sleeping was bad (too early to bed, too early out of bed) and it will get worse
I will  probably have headaches in a few days, and a general feeling of fatigue (starting to have it)
And just now the light outside seems too damn bright
(You are very lucky
You can borrow mine any time
When it works, it is great
When it doesn't... well
there is coffee .
We are always at the top on organ donations and have one of the most efficient public health systems in the world
We were the first country on history to pacifically transition between a dictatorship to a democracy
We decriminalized gay marriage in 2004
Super early
I had a connection in Brussels airport once and I don't doubt for a moment that what you say is true
They might as well build the halls out of chocolate
oh wow that's beautiful
№ 5 on the list, checking in
Sunshine and copious amounts of olive oil will keep us strong
This is incredibly wholesome
Yeah well
is that really saying much considering that the main reason we transitioned was because that bastard died while he was still in power
For Spain I can say that dog on the streets doesn’t mean stray dog
I’ve never seen a a stray dog, and I live in Barcelona and have been to Madrid, Valencia, Murcia and Andalucía. Some rural areas as well
Cats, indeed, but not dogs
Yeah they almost always have an owner, they're just more outdoors dogs, you can tell because they're always well fed and their fur is well kept
There are definitely stray dogs, not many in cities but they're a pretty common sigh on small rural towns
Doesn't mean they are living on misery, usually people feed them and some of them are actually fat
Never seen them in Almeria
More than nuclear plants, actually
A fake mediterranean island, where you can have all the scum of Europe together with context in a beatiful setting
Chavs, drug dealers, russian mafia, corrupt politicians
Costa del Sol, with some kind of Marbella city full of mafia, rich people and corrupt politicians
Minsk in 1999 for me, it fits completely
I'd say Madrid, because it has a lot of drug dealing, you can drive on the streets like a madman
Barcelona and their narcoflats sounds nice, i dont really know about other countries much so i cant say about them
or alternatively a story about the narcos in galicia during the 80's opening up a cocaine route from colombia into europe
Either Belfast or Bilbao
London, but I'd like rockstar to add different cities and you can travel to them by train or plane
I don't think Ibiza would like more negative publicity, tbf
We can have even gangs of all countries with names based for some reason on bad food stereotypes
"The Underground Paelas"
"The Pastatzi family"
"The Baguettis crew"
"The Frankfun10 team"
"The pretcelli gang"
And so on
Not a city,but galicia
It’s always those two cities (and Rome)
Agree
Could be Malta
I didn't know about Just Cause, looks very fun
But it feels like it lacks the satire I was hinting at with my idea doesn't it
with it being a fictional total dictatorship and all that
Yup
But instead of "the passione" they have some guys that literally kill for pasta
"Las Ramblas" street in Barcelona
I just don't get it: expensive bars, bad food and way too many people
The only  authentic barcelonese experience you can have there is getting your wallet stolen
The thousands of restaurants with "Spanish" food served that are run by asians and instead of paella they serve rice with yellow colorant
Ibiza
Tourists ruined it
Barcelona probably
Madrid center is expensive in general because its a rich area, but prices on barcelona are way more affected by tourism and people have to pay a higher cost of living because of the influx of tourists
[Heres a map of tourism in Spain] with most red areas having "tourist traps" probably
The best paella is not in Valencia but in the towns near Albufera
Almost every restaurant of the Valencia center are turist traps
Restaurants in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid
Isn't Plovdiv the oldest city in Europe
I didn't know it was touristy
How is life there
The good thing about las Ramblas is not the street, but the neighborhoods it has at each side
El Gòtic, Raval, Born, this is the good stuff
I was in Pisa and you're absolutely right
Only Chinese people, nothing "real" of traditional there
I heard it's a nice to chill for a few days/weeks (for people living there or sow travellers)
I'm surprised to hear now it's your typical bleak and fake touristy city
This reminds me of when some german friends came to visit us
We took them to the area with all the bars, really popular and we were looking for a restaurant to eat at
All the restaurants in the main square were full of tourist and our friend suggested we eat at a certain restaurant
He said he chose this one because the other menus were all in several languages, and this one was only in Spanish, therefore the others were aimed at tourist
Our restaurant was more "primitive", but more for locals and more authentic
Another time we took some friend to another restaurant i'd never been to, and it honestly didn't look like much from the outside, just like a normal bar full of old men
But it was the best León food i've ever had
Just go for the more "rundown" and typical restaurant for an authentic meal
I went to the one in NYC and it seemed quite big, maybe just because i was 13 lol
The highlight for me was "seeing" famous people and comparing my height to them
I distinctly remember being just as tall as Miley Cyrus at the time
Amsterdam is very charming, and the museums are amazing
But I truly had the impresion of being in like a resort or disney landia
As if nobody really lived there
Just tourists, kebaps and italian and argentinian restaurants
Made in a factory and comfortably freezed so that everybody gets their shitty "Spanish food" in 5 minutes
It's truly insane
Cities like Madrid or Seville do a much better job with turism (in my opinion)
I really hate what barcelona has become
Such a great city, ruined by tourism (in my opinion)
It's even stressfull
I think if it wasn't full of tourists, kiosks, street vendors and what not it would be quite a nice boulevard, and I guess that's the appeal
It used to have appeal
Now unfortunately it's a shithole
Everywhere in Barcelona tbh
When i still worked there there were some articles in foreign media advising caution in barcelona (there's kind of okupation problem and pickpocketing) and the catalan government went nuts over it
But it's fucking true
That kind of behaviour is not that weird
Spain is fairly racist against romanian gypsies and parentless moroccan kids (the two groups mostly associated with the pickpocketing thing) so nobody cares if the police tackle or hit them a bit
I saw once a police officer straight up hitting with his stick in the chest and in the knee a moroccan 15 yo that was running with a stolen bag
That's something most people don't know about Spain
Our police will hit (a bit) you if you missbehave (nudism in near the beach, being extra drunk and doing shit, stealing, etc)
I saw it several times in Barcelona to mostly american tourists
Yeah that region arrou d there is the only semi-arid region in europe
Heat can get pretty brutal
If you are asking for barcelona There're very few spots that haven't been taken over by tmass tourism but I'd reccomend mounnt tibidabo
It's not that popular and the view is amazing
A if you have the time, the Abey of Montserrat is great too, a different taste of catalonia
&#x200B;
If you are asking Spain in general, the entire northern coast of Cantabria and Asturias are breathtakingly beautiful (and the food might be the best in Spain)
That's the good thing, if they try they can make it good too,they just need to Want to do it good
I'm ashamed
I went there and I left as fast as I could because of the tourists
I will definitely return to see that, thanks
Probably, yeah
Mostly centrum
The furthest i went was the naval museum
Yep, just don't go where you see only tourists eating and I guarantee you it will be good food (probably they won't sell paella there, but for other reasons)
I've lived in 3 spanish cities: Bilbao, Barcelona and now Madrid
Bilbao is tiny and tourism very seasonal but i must say that between Barcelona and Madrid I find Madrid much more authentic and comfortable to vissit
Except for like the most centric part, madrid manages it much better imo
Even the "touristy" parts are filled with Madrid locals on a sunday morning just having some beers
You know what I mean
Barcelona's summer heat is literally the worst in Spain
so fuccking humid
I preffer teh drier heat you get in the interior
I'M FROM RONDA AND THAT PLACE IS 100m FROM MY HOME SO I LOVE YOU <3 (And to answer your comment, I'd say that having a good nose for bad restaurants/bars is common between Spaniards, given that a lot of our social life happens there)
Meant tiny just compared to Barcelona and Madrid haha
Es que el mejor pueblo de la tierra <3 vuelve cuando quieras jajajaja
I'm a bad Spaniard
I don't like village festivals, I don't like a beer after work, I hate jamón serrano, of course I don't sleep siesta and my skin is very white, even in summer
I should be expelled from the country just because of the ham
I like to have a long siesta after lunch when I can (weekends and holidays)
When I was younger I partied all the weekend nights, but nowadays I prefer a good dinner and a film on TV
I don't like to party, football or beer and wine
I don't like flamenco, feria or places with a lot of people and noise
And siesta is something that I do from time to time when really needed but I hate that if it gets out of control, I get up feeling like shit
But I really like tapas and going to bars
I'm very fond of the Spanish cuisine and the laid back culture
I really don't know more Spanish stereotypes
I am spanish but cannot eat la tortilla española because i am allergic to eggs
I'm a vegetarian (so I don't eat jamón), I hate parties at discos, I hate reggeaton (it gives me migraines xd), I don't scream when I talk and I hate that others do, I don't enjoy the sun in summer (but I love it when the temperature is low enough for human beings to exist), I've always found seafood disgusting
I don't like drinking alcohol and I'll never do cocaine
I'm moving to Germany, I hope I fit in better, tbh
I am bad at being Spanish
I haven't met people in a couple weeks, last week I went to visit a castle and this week I went to the mountains to ski, all alone
I dont like football
I play guitar, but I like death metal
I am alergic to the shrimps so I cannot eat paella and most important, I deeply hate toros
My friends (Yes I have friends) call me the swede
I do Siesta
I'm not a loud person though, and also pretty chill compared to the stereotype
I love jamón serrano, I love to take siestas, I use like half a liter of olive oil a week and I talk loud and fast
I also lover partying hard, but now I don't feel like it
does you mom/gf have a mustache tho
otherwise you might be on our side of the border
Everything you described (minus the oh la la
) applies to Spain too
Tell me at least that you put onion in your tortilla
I'm offended
Sir, give me your DNI and exit the country please
Yes you should
I am short, barely 155cm, so I was always the short one everywhere
However I am blonde, got blue eyes and pale skin (to the point of having family history of skin cancer, I have no idea how my ancestors survived) anyway my face is very pan European but my height gives me away all the time
I also looooove bread, Spanish bread is the best
Andestá er Beti
You made me laugh, thank you
I feel you, my friends call me "the german" for the same reasons, it is not an insult, it's just because I'm don't have much problem staying at home
I also think in germans drinking beer, watching football matches and having party but, whatever
I don't care, I like both
But I want the tortilla to be very well-cooked, if I see a thread of raw egg I'm out
We don't know, he's under investigation
Hey, don't do that
You've given him the option of repeating his words, and I'm not sure I can survive it
Look what you've done
you'll have [to find me] first
Yes, it was fun when I was a kid
Now you can't convince me to go to a village festival, not even for all the sweet fair wine in the world
The crowds, the plastic chairs, drunks, the whistling of fairground rides, the amateur orchestras singing tacky songs
I get tired just thinking about it
I know that
They call me the swede usually when I come from the silence with a solution for something
Or when I massively complain about the inneficiency and byzantinism of the Spanish systems, which is often
Usually the job-related things, such as holidays or work schedule
I'm calling the police
You were not kidding, that might be the least Spanish response possible
Some childhood trauma is the most likely hypothesis
I  d o n t  l i k e  j a m ó n, serrano, iberico, fed on acorns or squirrel droppings
It smells bad and the texture is disgusting
(─‿‿─)
Well, if you've ever experienced the way things work outside Iberia, then seeing the systems here really makes your blood boil sometimes
Plenty to complain about
But honestly, 'German/Swedish acting' Spaniards are common enough that it's a recognizable reason for that nickname
Im right behind you
I don't know
one time my downstairs neighbor called the police on us for a noise complaint
It was just my roommate and I sitting at home watching TV
I'm still mystified at that
This is clearly a more serious offence
If you bake cakes that aren't totally dry there are "raw egg" juices, if you make scrambled eggs that aren't solid rubber there are "raw egg" juices
Tortilla, in Spain, means omelette
Flour doughs are often called tortas
[Tortilla española or potato omelette]
[Undercooked tortilla española]
I think it is easy to choose
I'm just joking ;) if you don't like it, you don't like it
Don't worry, I'm not going to lecture you about it, I'm sure you're fed up of that
I know how things work outside
There are things that work and things that not
I realised that it is not the problems you have, it is how you solve them
The huge problem and it is a problem that we share for example with Italy is that people does not feel linked to the system, so just ' I do my thing and the remaining is other's problem'.
I'm saying goodbye to my family
probably british
Be careful, my grandmother had problems with the neighbours over the noise and it ended with her """accidentally""" scraping their car
Yeah, my grandmother was notified of a petty crime at age 73
I'm glad you survived xD
Ohohoho
Right on the head of what I find one of the most depressing traits of Spain indeed
I spent a lot of my youth in other countries, so it's depressing when among my friends in Spain I see them leaving trash in public spaces, or doing things that might cause problems for others (or simply not be good for the community) just because whatever it is won't affect them personally
And then going to another country and see my friends there instead pick up trash others have left in parks since their mentality is that everyone should try to help out when possible
Imho this is caused by one simple fact
Spanish people does not feel that their decision may change the system
This means, you are not even owner of your house, no decision power on how things are going
Only a grain in the 47 million dessert
A couple years ago I linked a study on attitudes between countries that got a lot of upvotes in this sub
One of the most distinctive questions was: do you feel like your outcome in life is under your control
And yeah, Spain was right there near one extreme whilst the US was on the other
This is set in "Spain", so we are gathering all the Mexicans around Los Angeles and make a happy crowd
Best examples of cringe:
\- Vantage point
\- Mission impossible 2
They burn saints, in a delirious mix of Fallas and Seville's Holly Week
\- Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
In american movies they seem to think that Mexico would represent us well enough
Any movie placed in Spain is from a Mexico set
Some examples:
-Completely disregarding Spanish traditions or assuming that everywhere is the same (there's lots of diverdity in Spain in languages, nature and traditions) such as flamenco dancers all over Barcelona and everybody being a gypsy dancer
Also, we don't burn our Saints (mixing fallas and procesiones)
Also confusing Spanish regional dances with the Argentinian tango or even mariachis
- People speaking a south american accent
- People with native american features, we have immigration but you can't assume we all look like native americans
- Everybody eats paella, all the time
- People wearing traditional dresses in everyday life
- All men are "macho men".
- we don't have mountains or woods, everything takes place in a desert or a very dry place
Some shows/movies with very wrong representations: McGuiver, How I met you mother, Mission Impossible, night and day, family guy
"Spanish" police in an american TV show clearly being latinos and with a thick chicano/mexican accent
Or any movie about colonization where spaniards are 99% of the time greedy brutes, while of course the other colonizers are brave and honorable often times, and rarely portrayed in such manner
>*Spaniards who came to the* New World *seeking opportunities beyond the prospects of their European  environment, are contemptuously called cruel and greedy "goldseekers,"  or other opprobrious epithets virtually synonymous with "Devils"; but  Englishmen who sought New World opportunities are more respectfully  called "colonists," or "homebuilders," or "seekers after liberty
" \[...\]  When Spaniards expelled or punished religious dissidents, this came to  be known as "bigotry," "intolerance," "fanaticism," and a cause of their  decline
When Englishmen, Dutchmen, or Frenchmen did the same thing, it  is known as "unifying the nation," or safeguarding it against treason  or foreign conspiracy
>\-*Tree of Hate* (2008 edition), page 11
>Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
When i Saw the bananas i lost It
It's awfull
Legendary McGyver episode
As Spain is in South America, North of Spain is North of the Amazonian rainforest, OBVIOUSLY:
> - Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
Came looking for this
Absolute legend
I'm always amazed that USAns cry racism/cultural appropriation before you can open your mouth while assassinating other cultures like this with no repercussions
I need to see this
It's hilarious
We need to fund this movie
Well, you have highlander :)
>how I met your mother
They got so many things wrong in very few seconds for Spain
The cities names AND their locations on the map are wrong, and of course, Mexican mariachis and argentinian tango in Spain, because, why not
>Eurotrip
Good lord, that's terrible and absolutely hilarious
I need to see it
does Spain get the same American cliché treatment
I tell you they do better
According to mcguiver Spain IS in southamerica and the basques live among banana plantations, plotting their Next assault against Barcelona
We also dance tango and listen to mariachis
Let me translate:  the US is in africa, independentist texans live in the jungle plotting their next assault against Alabama
They also dance irish jigs and listen to reggae
I see your point
And there's a lack of representation
However there's been improvement, i'm seeing more and more shows that feature catalan
And there's also another reality that you're not talking about
Almost everyone in Spain talks spanish
a while ago i made the argument that the second language most spoken in Spain IS spanish
And though it would be amazing if we had more catalan, basque or galician in our movies, i would LOVE It at least, the truth IS that most movies even when they take place in different regions Will stick with one language
Think of english movies, which choose to subtitle
Very few
If language doesn't play an integral part of the story you can still tell the story changing the language
Or do you watch every movie produced in europe in their original language
Sincerely, It seems you're just trying to push an idea instead of answering the op's question
What you tell is still interesting and i believe people will enjoy It, but IS that the worst representation you can think of, Barcelona appears in looooots of films and as far as i know few do them Justice
Really, the worst
Check how i met your mother, or macguiver, where basque terrorist plan an attack on Barcelona amidst a humid jungle full of banana plantations
> the conflict happens within people that actually speak different language
Txato is allegedly euskaldun
Gorka is a renowned writer in euskera
These things are an important part of the message of the book that you seem that you have missed
lmao, how is this real
At least they used something like the real thing instead of a small church in the Mexican desert or a mosque in Morocco
not a bad idea at all hehe
Offend two countries at the price of one
never seen it
> It seems you're just trying to push an idea instead of answering the op's question
99% of this guy's comments
Exactly
See
You no longer are jealous of the Irish, you do have shitty shows that "take place in your country"
God, I couldn't finish the first season
I doubt the average american would watch the sketch and say "Ted is so ignorant, haha"
>"Ocho apellidos vascos" (Eight Basque surnames) and then "Ocho apellidos catalanes" (Eight Catalan surnames)
These were welcome by most Spaniards, but for those of us that are in the territories they're depicting, it's the most cringe thing to watch; it's literally a tourist approach, but within your own country
That's a parody
Everyone knows It
It's supposed to be cringy that's the fun of It
It's just like an italian in Norway or welcome to the sticks
It's very different when in a SERIOUS movie they do a horrible job at portraying the country
Yeah, i just saw him on Sports to add in the olympics
Of course he HAD TO complain here's his cry: Spain didn't let Catalonia compete with it's own national team
WhAT An INjuStICe
Well you said "the most unreal representations" are from within the country
>I never said it's the worst representation,
> I just was saying that representation within the same country is already bad enough
I Really didn't read that
You know unreal to worst isn't really that Big of a leap in this case
>Now, what's a show that features Catalan or Basque, if I may ask
You say there're improvements, but I see none
>I hope you don't mean that Barcelona based production show that was bilingual and wasn't even aired, just put online by the public TV
(Then TV3 did air it, ironically enough, and it was of course not well received
I already told you merli, which was a hit
I STILL have to ask my mother about her policiaca
I agree there's still very little and i get what no representation can feel like
My bad, I meant Outlander
But highlander is pretty cool
I can't tell you of any movie but my mother IS watching a couple of shows
I can ask her
I don't watch It because policiacas aren't my stuff
But merli for example was a hit, and i for one watched It in catalan
>Sure, that's what I said
You conveniently threw out of your quote how I said they were comedies
Yeah, i also missed out the part where you say the concept itself IS horrible
I didn't conveniently left out anything I started with the name of the movie to be clear about it
Two of my best friend's are Andalucian and basque and they enjoyed the movie
the second one was quite hard to swallow i'll give you that
>This kind of treatment could even be argued as anticonstitutional, as it directly goes against the 3rd Article
How
I'm not gonna lie  i didn't read the full article but i didn't se anything about It
I did see that "amor a la patria" IS listed among the things to be taught
which i must say IS a tad terrifying
>I'm not saying that there aren't shows in Catalan, like Merlí, I'm saying that there're no shows, nor movies, nor tv news in Castillian and aimed at the broadest audiences that show with a reasonable regularity someone speaking another language, with the proper subtitles
Catalan, gallician and basque are all very localised languages in spain
I get that from Catalonia you might not get that idea
I think It happens In part because when people move away they tend to talk the local language
in my day to day Life i Hear no catalan, basque or gallician, despite there being lots of them in Madrid
The other way around It also works
There was a huge wave of migrants from Andalucia to Catalonia, But they now Talk catalan
It would be absurd to ask for a catalan show with Andalucian dialects
I'm telling you: the reasonable regularity here is 0
It's waaaay more uncommon heating catalan than english
>In 80 years of Spanish tv, this hasn't happened, so it's been 80 years where people in Spain from monolingual territories can only see in the screen people speaking their language
We're erased from the collective imaginary, and as a result we're perceived as exotic, when we're citizens like everyone else
40 of which have been under the dictatorship
and you're not erased from the collective imaginary, your language IS
It's a shitty thing, i'm not gonna lie
However Catalonia doesn't receive the same treatment
There's plenty of influence from Catalonia in the rest of Spain
From your people to your products, to everything
If you, a catalan feel forgotten Imagine an extremeño.
>Forty fucking years of public TV post dictatorship, and I still have to see RTVE interview someone in the streets speaking a language other than Castillian and putting up subs
Language IS a communication device
If someone asked me in english through the streets i would answer in english
RTVE IS Broadcasted all over Spain, the main issue IS not showing an indentity but convey information
That a confabulation of Spain, Portugal, the Italian Republics, France, England and the Netherlands somehow joined forces to rob Catalonia of its history and literature
According to the Institut Nova Història (New History Institute), the following characters were Catalan: Erasmus, Leonardo, Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, Hernán Cortés, Iheronymus Bosch, Cervantes, Magellan, Montaigne, Raffael, Pizarro, Gerolamo Cardano, and a long etcetera
I would love a movie about this
"Hey, nice to meet you, and I'm sorry for the loss
BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ANCIENT GREAT EMPIRE THAT GOT BORED AND
Don't forget the Titanosaurus, a catalonian dinosaur
Dont forget that they said Artur Mas(ex president of the autonomus comunnity of catalonia) was a direct descendant of leonardo da vinci
Same reason why aliens in Hollywood movies always attack the US
And many more
Just check their website and have fun
inh
cat
Oh, so Mas is descended from pedophiles in addition to slave traders
Sounds plausible given his actions ngl
ɑ. I tried for some time writting it like "a", but i didn't liked the results
I do write "r" though, I didn't like the one we are taught in school
I've used both, now I use the first one more often
"α" is more common in Spain, probably because it's usually easier to write it nicely
I write "a", but I'm the only one that I know who does it :(
My best friend does, and both my brothers too
Yes, same in Spain
Maybe some boys did but it was definitely considered "girlish", as also writing very perfectly round letters
Every time portugal doesn't give us enough points in eurovision there are public callings about either naval and land blockade or straight out total war (if it's just 1 point)
We often joke about conquering portugal and gibraltar
Yes, although is not a joke, GIBRALTAR ESPAÑOL
(Just kidding I don't care about a small piece of land)
Maybe it’s just my friends and I but specially during Eurovision times we joke about starting new invasions, specially towards Portugal, but also France and the UK (give us Gibraltar ffs)
Dont forget gibraltar
I'm pretty sure you already own magaluf lol
Germans literally had access to Mallorca before some Spaniards, it's already yours guys
You know that's so well known we even joke with that in Spain Mallorca the 17th lander
Olivenza's case went to the point that there is no sign of entering Portugal (on the Portuguese side ofc) from the bridge connecting Olivenza and Elvas
And a "espanhois filhos da puta, Olivença é nossa" behind Spain's sign
Nobody in Spain cares about keeping Olivenza though, most people don't even remember that Menorca was British for some time for example, apart from Catalanist Menorquins
Gibraltar though is another matter
Oh boy
> Olivença
Olivenza, carajo
Oh, yeah
Fuck scandinavia in eurovision hahaha
Probably
but they have a weird obsession over a tiny village called olivenza
Many people care about it
Tbh i like it for the memes and because of the geopolitics of the points
France and the netherlands talking about dividing belgium
where have i Heard this before
Most of the people Who live there are British, but the people Who work there are all Spanish, as far as i know
I have a good friend from La Línea de la Concepción (The neighboring spanish town) and he worked there
Well, we "inherited" It
with the army and fleet just outside lisbon
We make a deal, you guys help us retake Gibraltar and we give you a couple of islands with a lot of 1€ cold beers
Nice to know
Can you take west Midlands too
I have friends there and I don't want them to be in the bad part of the borders
And modest hahaha
If you aid us retaking Gibraltar we'll let you take Olivenza
So Portugal gets Olivenza, Spain Gibraltar, the UK Ceuta, Morocco Melilla, denmark skane, sweeden Åland, finland viborg and russia
lets say they have taken enough
I see it
Actually I see that fair lol
I don't make the rules dude
Right now it's mentioned, not as main story but high enough, just below Verstappen victory
The article is mainly informative and mentions that the results are not in line with foreign media polls
In terms of the general population, I doubt many will discuss it among friends or family, or even click in the articles
It's not a known topic and there are many other things going on
I watched a video on it in Youtube but I haven't heard anything about it in the news
In Spain it isnt being treated as a very important news, but the main national media dedicate a space to it and the headline of all of them can be summarized in "the last dictatorship in Europe" (I think they forget about one or two others at least, but okay
I was trying to follow it and was very pissed i couldn't. They write briefly about it, show some videos of the protest, but present it just as pissed people angry because they lost the elections, they explain no shit, don't give the background story, nothing
But many people in Spain can't even place Belarus in the map, so
-\_-
I read the El Mundo article and they gave a bit of explanation about it
Mentioned the irregularities and that the results might be rigged
But as you say, quite superficially
I just watched the tv news and FINALLY, they explained it way better
How spread out everything is
You need a car for everything it seems, the "automotive city" urban design really forces it on you
Even in the american bases they would make in Spain they would build everything spread out and you'd have the supermarket in one corner, the houses in another
forcing you to use the car pretty much
I get the heebie jeebies whenever I see a movie where American kids recite the pledge of allegiance
It reminds me to the Spanish kids during Franco's Dictatorship singing the Cara al Sol before class
This:
\- Where are you from
\- I'm from Spain
\- Really
I have a friend in Italy
The fact that tax isn't seen in the prices, the education system and the imperial system
Kinder egg
WHY
If you are gonna drive and have a gun you better not be drunk I guess
This
I've heard so many praises about the American service
During my visits I've always felt they just wanted my tip and nothing else
I've seen genuine kindness in service everywhere I've been, but in the US it always felt fake an uncomfortable
Tipping is a terrible idea
Start demanding proper salaries for your fellow citizens and stop this bs
This has probably more to do with climate
Cold/rainy countries mean you really have to leave your shoes when you enter or your house will need a LOT more cleaning
In warmer/dry countries your shoes do bring some dirt in, but since your windows will be open 24/7, it doesn't really make a difference
Here, taking off your shoes is a matter of comfort rather than hygiene
In my state (South Carolina) I had to pay a small fee and pass a written test in order to get my permit
With a permit I could only drive in daylight hours with an adult next to me, never alone
You have your permit for a minimum of six months, during which time you have to take an informational course (for me it was all day, like 8am-4pm)
Then I had to have behind-the-wheel practice with the instructor
I don’t remember how many hours it was but I remember going four or five times and driving with him for basically the afternoon during each time
Then, once your six months is past, you can take another written test and then a behind-the-wheel test
If you pass you get your license
If you don’t, you have to stick with your permit I think for another six months but I can’t remember
I passed mine the first time
American here, it used to be more expensive
It also really depends where you are
I’m from a rural state and there was a big farm of like gasoline tanks (?) (i don’t know what they are called) and apparently that tank farm was linked directly with a major port where crude oil was brought in
So for us it was always cheaper than the average
When i was in high school (late 2000s-early 2010s) I remember hearing about gas being as much as 5-6 USD in bigger cities in the north and I thought that was crazy
For us the highest it ever got was about 3
75 I guess
Since I moved abroad I’ve heard that it has gotten insanely cheap and whenever I go back it’s almost always under 2
From what I’ve read this has been due to the US finding its own oil using fracking instead of importing it
It’s insanely cheap now from what I hear, about 1
18 in my area
As an American living in Spain I think it came out from good intentions
you also hear about the probably-racist American who hears Spanish and assumes that they are Mexican, which reflects his perception that all Spanish-speaking countries are just other Mexicos with different names but the same culture
Stupid Americans come to Spain all the time are are disappointed when they don’t find spicy foods and tacos
Two different cultures entirely
So when immigrants come from other countries I think it makes sense that they would want to specify what kind of culture they come from
A lot of Spanish people will see an Asian person and just assume they come from China and call them “chinos”, but will also get really annoyed when people come up to them and put a Mexican sombrero on them, ask them about día de los muertos, and tell them and their favorite food is the quesadilla
Usually the people that are more specific about “Race” tend to be more educated about different cultures, at least in the states
That’s one thing I wish existed a bit more here
Yes, we do
* 1 day of paid leave for moving
* 15 days for getting married
* 2 days for the death, accident or illness of your spouse or of a parent, child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild of yours or of your spouse
This gets extended to 4 days if travel is required
Aside from this, we also have maternity and paternity leave of course
16 weeks for each parent
And there’s medical leave, which is regulated differently
This is the basic number of days that everyone’s entitled to by law
If a sector/company has its own bargaining agreements they can extend these paid leaves, but never reduce them
Here in Spain you get 1 day when you move house, and 2 freaking weeks if you get married
What is amazing for me is the sick leave when you have a sick child here in slovakia
Pure porn guys
In Spain we have 17 different public health systems to manage blood donations (plus other independent ones like the Red Cross), so I don't know if any of them gives you a day off, but in sure getting paid for any kind of donation is strictly forbidden
Is it common to get 50th birthday off and paid
My [Finnish] company does that
Funnily enough they also list Friday pulla (sweet cardamom buns for those of you who don't know) as a benefit
Wow interesting
Great parental leave and allowance to take care of your child
15 days when getting married in Spain :)
> I hope that's common in Europe
Paid
The first 3 days are unpaid by default in Spain
Yes, exactly, I think that’s the point of it
It’s meant to cover the honeymoon
I never realized it was unusual for other countries before
Crazy because it's a desperate measure to increase natality
Yes, it makes sense
I think that the reason behind this 15-day leave is actually the honeymoon
For some couples, it can be a struggle to coordinate with both of their companies so that they get the exact same week/weeks off, particularly in the summer
This is actually a recurring issue in many workplaces each summer
I'm afraid to ask,
I prefer the pulla tbh
Do you think so
It never occurred to me that that could be reason behind it
If that’s so, I’m not sure it makes a lot of sense
That's great
Yeah, i don't know how people are supposed to have kids when they are expected to go back to work just after, and then pay crazy amounts for childcare
I know some do it by choice, but it's nice to live in a country where you have the option to stay and take care of your children as well
My mother has gone to work sick and she is a school teacher (recently retired)
[This web has a nice summary in Spanish]
* First 3 days: 0 €.
* From 4th to 15th days: 60% salary paid by the employer
* From the 16th to the 20th: 60% salary paid by the Social Security
* From 21st:  75% salary paid by the Social Security
However this is not universal, I am a software engineer and my employer pays sick days since the first day
But, retail/hospitality workers gets the legal minimum if they are lucky, because many work partially/totally in cash and that doesn't get paid when you are sick
It's the first 3 days of an official medical leave
The thing is that you usually don't request a medical leave if you are going to miss three days or less, it's usually enough with a doctor's note (and you get paid time-off)
I'm not really sure of why it's like that, but it's like paying a "bureaucracy tax".
I learnt this the hard way the first time I got the flu on my first full time job
I woke up sick on a Thursday and I asked for a medical leave, so I lost thee days salary (including the Saturday, which I wasn't going to work anyway)
It would have been enough with a doctor's note for the Thursday and Friday, and I would had got the full salary
Edit: as a clarification: while you are in "medical leave", you get paid by Social Security (who "takes" the first three days), but if you have a doctor's note you are still paid by your employer
>find a job in Spain
You will have trouble with that one
I don't think there are many secrets left in Spain, but Asturias is an absolutely gorgeus place not so visited by foreigners
Outsanding nature, cheap and wonderful food and cider
And as you asked for a city, Oviedo is a place I really like
Other small city not very visited by tourists that I love are Cáceres and Cuenca
I think Toledo, Ávila and Segovia receive a lot of tourists fron Madrid, but I love those too
In Spain there are many gems hidden from tourists, but if I had to choose only one I would say the Cíes Islands
Luckily it's well preserved and not a shame like some tourist-oriented places in the mainland coast, full of english pubs where there's always someone puking or completely wasted on the street
This is very specific but the Jewry of Seville
very very beautiful and if you go with a sevillian that knows a little history (like me) it’s even better
One of my favorite parts of Seville honestly
The name of that city sounds kind of triste
It was winter so maybe I'm wrong about it, but I was positively surprised by Lucca, I found the city really cool and it didn't had any tourist when I went during the winter, in the other hand Firenze was still a nightmare, and Pisa was
Pisa
Probably during the summer it's not the same experience
In Spain our secrets are not cities, but our rural areas and natural reserves, foreign people here only travels to places that are very accesible and close to a big city
My recent favourite is Huesca, the region is full of medieval towns and the natural parks there are gorgeous, but only Spaniards visit them
The thing about the North of Spain is that it isn't what people typically think of when they think Spain
It really is just like seattle or Vancouver: Green, rainy, Rocky shores etc
Ayyy i live in Oviedo :)
Yup, it's a toss up between Gijon and Oviedo
Yesss and I think a lot of places from the north-west part of Spain are hidden to tourism in general
But hey, it's not worth it, better go to south (?
So beautiful they even made a series based there
It’s also a hidden gem, it’s called The Office
Huesca IS just amazing
I know, most tourists come to Spain because of the weather, and the North is not very sunny to be honest
Lucky man, I love your city
Basque Country is such a unique and wonderful place, both to visit and to live
I've only been once though, but I want to come back as soon as possible
I've never been to the south
I live in Asturias so I know a lot about these "hidden gems" of the north
Any place you would totally recommend in the south
People in these areas might not speak English, but to be honest it doesn't matter, specially nowadays with smartphones: google maps, translator apps, etc
it's not difficult to travel without speaking the language, you always find a way
I've been to a lot of places with strong language barriers (hello China), I recommend to have 3-4 translator apps downloaded with all the available offline content, also an offline maps app like maps
me (you can use your phone gps without mobile data for free)
Also a list with names of places and key words it's also cool to have, and that's it
Córdoba without a doubt
The old center and the mosque are really worth it
It's fascinating the mix of cultures you can appreciate there, and to get lost in the old narrow streets
It's better to go in spring with all the flowers blooming, but you'll see yourself surounded by tons of tourists
Also Sevilla, in my opinion is popular for a reason, big but pretty and full of wonderful people and great green areas
You also have the coast, but I haven't been there that much
In Spanish we have the word “embarazada” which means “to be pregnant
” If you’re an English or Italian (imbarazzata/o) speaker, you’d maybe think it means “to be embarrassed,” but you’d be totally wrong to think that,
The first word that comes to my mind is "constipado", which means the cold or the verb "constipar", to have a cold
Many times I saw in UK spanish people sick, because we weren't used to british weather in winter, and they stated without hesitation "I'm constipated today
" while they blew their noses and sneezed
Actual
In English means "real" in spanish means "current" (current time, not something like a water current) The pronunciation is different, in Spanish the last syllabe is the stressed one
Exit - Éxito (success)
Exit is translated as salida, to exit = salir
Carpet - carpeta (folder) a carpet is an "alfombra"
Being Constipated - estar constipado well, in spanish means you catch a cold
Constipated is translated as "estreñido"
In spanish, "constipado" and constipated have completely different meanings
Constipado is to have a cold
Constipated is to be estreñido
Propina in Spanish means tip but in Portuguese it means bribe
I find it very funny because it seems like you are calling a bribe a "tip" ironically
Spanish embarazada/o and English embarrassed
Embarazada means pregnant in Spanish while in English embarassed means, you know, embarassed
Exprimir in Spanish means to squeeze, but in French, exprimer it means to explain
Caca un Spanish is poop too
Japanese is thought to be an isolated language coming from somewhere in Siberia so wouldn't surprise me if they are very far related, like Indo-European languages are
Also, "molestar" means to bother someone, but "to molest someone"...well prepare to be 10 years in prison
Edit: more than one has said innocently that X was molesting Y in a casual tone and received a mortified stare in exchange before realising the mistake
Also carpeta and carpet
In Spanish "banco" is also a bank and a bench
Can confirm most of us thinks "footing" means jogging
aceite (oil) in spanish comes from the hispanic-arab azzáyt, which comes from the clasic arab azzayt
Many words in spanish come from arab, I wonder if those similar italian words (like aceto) have the same origin
I guess this counts
I live in Spain, and for most people spanish is associated with Spain altough Mexico is much bigger and spanish is spoken in almost all Latin America
In the US is associated with Mexico instead
We don't feel overwhelmed at all by the news related to them, and I guess they are not overwhelmed with our news either
It is obvious that we are closer and maybe we get a bit more information in news about Cuba's situation, Venezuelas crisis, Chile's revolution or Colombia's demonstrations against police violence
I don't know how informed they keep about what happens in Spain though
When it comes to internet, this is what I have realized: In youtube there is a clear majority of Latin American content, but when you google something you will most likely find information associated to Spain
For example, if you google what the steps to create a company are, most information showing up will be from Spain
You look for travel recomendations to X country, you will fin the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Spain
Sometimes, when I try to look for a information of a specific Latin American country it is hard to get the information from that specific country you want
Not when I lived in Spain, as Google is quite good at filtering news from your country
But now that I live in the UK Google is not sure when I ask in Spanish if I want something from LatinAmerica or Brazil, rarely I get info from Spain
That's really weird, I've never come across that problem with Spanish
I always get Spain-related stuff, never Latin American
Funnily latin americans seem to have the sterotype that Spain is full of youtubers because apparently they're too dominant, and indeed almost all spanish-language youtubers I know are spanish
Greece
An island if I could choose
Germany, I visited the Southwest of the country and fell in love
I guess I'd love the south of Poland and France or Switzerland as well
Italy or Greece, or possibly Portugal
I wouldn't stand living in nordic countries or central Europe
Definitely Germany, the salaries are great and public services are also pretty good
I don't really agree with how the government is dealing with the climate crisis but I for living it's a no brainer
Netherlands  or Norway
Both are great economies, with interesting cultures and awesome life quality
I'd miss Spanish weather, but I prefer high quality life standards than sunny weather
No matter how broken Italy is it's still my first option
If I had to pick a nearby place that's the Basque Country for sure, what an amazing language
Plus the scenery and food
Otherwise I'd say the Nordic countries because I personally love some aspects of their way of living and doing things, along with language itself
With a place like Mauritius, you have to consider the isolation
I've lived a bit in Hawaii, a place that many consider paradise, and while it is a pretty idyllic place, once the vacation mode wears off, life is the same as anywhere else
Palm trees and beaches won't pay your bills or fill the holes in your life, and now you're stuck on a tiny rock, with very fixed geographical limits many hours and hundreds of € away from anything else
I suppose it's easy to take the connective-ness of everything in Europe for granted, it's a hard thing to realize until you don't have it
Maybe it's just a personal preference - It's definitely right for some people, but it's also something that many overlook when considering places like this
Same
You're getting one way ticket to Siberia
Irregular verbs: are we a joke to you
incorrecto
I read this in an italian accent
While throwing my hands up of course
jaja te entiendo
estaba intentando de pensar en una frase más completa que pudieras decir en palabras que terminen en o que sean similares a las del inglés pero no pude
Ni puta idea de lo que me estáis contando
Spaniard here (F30 at the time)
English teacher for context
Once on holidays in Manchester, a couple of guys sitting nearby started talking about my boobs and ass,assuming that given my (very stereotypical) Spanish looks, I’d just be an ignorant tourist with no clue of the language spoken in the area
Poor dumbasses
I listened and when their girlfriends came back from wherever they had been, I approached the table and explained the whole situation to them
Their faces were priceless
Epic moment,
Loved Manchester tho
I have been mistaken for a Brit 3 times this year
In my own fucking country
Yeah, that has happened to me too while playing 5v5 games
People that speak anything that isn't English tend to asume that the rest of the players can't understand them
Yes, I am
They told me I looked British
Is the Spanish deck of cards known at all in other countries
Whenever I see people playing cards in foreign media its always the [French deck]
I was wondering if people outside Spain known at all the [Spanish deck] or if its something inherently Spanish that nobody else really knows- [Example of how the cards look]
Or if you know other decks besides the French deck, wich one is it
I think they are known to Spain only, I am from the city that makes them so obviously I know them quite well
Not trying to advertise someone's product, but during lockdown my friends have been virtually playing with them in the game Tabletop Simulator and we have had drinking and playing virtual meetings :)
In Spain we call those games brisca, tresillo, and escoba
We play plenty of brisca and escoba here too :))
I guess it comes from the time when the Philippines was a Spanish colony
>Spanish cards: used in the centre (except Tuscany) and in the south, they are basically the same of Spanish cards
(Here the ones used in Naples)
Apparently this design comes from the now extinct "Madrid design" of the Spanish deck
This is the most common in Spain nowadays:  [
Only 3 jacks
Thats a weird ass deck
Never heard of  l'hombre, how do you play it
Cleaves or batons
Venetian Republic intensifies
Like the Italian, Spanish decks usually have 40 cards: 1-7 and 3 characters per colour
There're decks of 52 to play some games but that's pretty recent, normally we use the french deck for those
Edit: Decks of 48 are common in some regions, they include 8 and 9s.
Aren't there numbers in the corners for that
When you buy them they include 8s and 9s because they can be used for some games but they're generally taken out (and often lost or thrown away)
Check the pdf catalog, decks of 40 cards are the most common format
8 and 9s are only common in catalan decks
I don't even know if young people play cards anymore but what I can assure you is that up north french decks are a very common household item, french games like rabino are pretty popular
I think french and spanish cards are of the same size and material or at least mine are identical
In Spain you have to do some basic tests every 10 years
Sight, eye-hand coordination and such
I mean, theoretically here in Spain you have to renew your driving license every 10 years and every 5 once you're older than 65, but virtually everyone passes those tests
In Spain elderly people have to renew their license every year by doing some tests about their vision and reflexes
However, even if they look potential dangerous, there are not evidences that they are the main risk on the road
Drunk and people watching their phones are more dangerous
I went and check for the UK, and the BBC says that [young drivers (17-24) have 4 times more accident than drivers over 70]
I'll start wearing a jacket at 20ºC, below 15-10ºC I'll change to a thicker and better jacket
Under 5ºC I'll start promising myself that this year I'll buy some gloves and a hat but I never do it
At 0ºC or below that I'll use various layers of clothes because my jacket was not designed for that and I'll complain about the cold every 5min until reaching a building
Below 8 is jacket time
Around 0 is: _is this real
I’m from Almeria
In London my preference is the same haha
In summer, below 25-27ºC or something like that (I live in the south), in winter maybe 10-12ºC
like 10-15°C. That's "damn I should have brought a jacket". +1 if it's windy, that shit gets to my bones
- 5-10 ºC: cold-ish, I'll wear a light jacket
- 0-5 ºC: cold, wear a good jacket, gloves, a neck warmer
- <0 ºC: f****ng cold, wear the same, maybe with better gloves and a sweater inside (and I'll still be cold everywhere else in my body, anyway)
I was going to write mine
but it's pretty much the same
Same here, was wearing my fleece at home the other day and it was only like 17°
Same, i would be comfy in an oven
Where are you from, Im from Castille and thought ive always handled cold good, like yes maybe around 15°-10° I'll get a sweeter if its 0°-5° maybe a jacket too I still remember a weeding, we were in my hometown Soria, already night it was chilly but we all wore no jacket or sweater just with the weeding shirt and some guys who came to the weeding i don't know if from Valencia or Andalucía were freaking freazing, i won't forget me casully wearing my shirt while looking at a ldy with a pelt coat trying his best not to frooze
I'm from Barcelona, so yeah for me going below 20ºC is already a nighmare hahaha
I frequent a lot the Pyrenees as I have family there and for me it's an instakill when going on winter
A friend of mine from Cantabria now is living there, came to Burgos with me to spend the weekend and the sucker was all fucking day complaining how cold he was
hahaha once you get used to it, it's difficult to go back
I can't handle heat, everytime i go to Madrid to visit friends or family in the city its just slighty warm maybe veintipico not even 30 but i melt like a fucking ice cream i seriously cant handle it, and honestly im damn terrified of visiting Andalucía because i seriously think i would just die
Well, Soria in winter sure kills me
i Freeze at 5°C celsius
Jajajaja not so bad it isn't as cold as it used to be, i like our weather its nice and chilly, you can be at 0° walking putaide and you feel the cold in your skin in a nice way, feels chill, now i live in Burgos this pñace like a fucking polar hell, maybe they are the same temperature but here cold isn't chilly, gets up your damn fucking bones and doesn't matter how many layers you are carrying you ll carry the cold inaide because its windy and wet all fucking day
That sounds awfull
I lived a year in Ireland
It doesn't really get that cold, 8°C, but it's 75% humidity when it's not raining
In winter i wouldn't feel my toes for the whole day, i would thaw them at home
Sometimes It just hailed out of nowhere
once I forgot my coat
i never, ever forgot my coat again
Humidity makes the difference, but negative numbers
nope, feel like another surreal world and i'm not too eager to explore It
Yea fuck humidity, all my homies like dry weather, jokes apart you don't get to below 0 in Barcelona
It was something im so used to i thought happened everywhere
Well, i'm not from Barcelona, but a quick search, shows that, nope, they don't get to 0°C. Once i met a girl from Benidorm and she didn't even own a jacket
no need
As for me i live near Madrid and every year i consider going into hibernation
Less than 0°C IS pretty strange in the city
However, I recently moved to San Lorenzo de El Escorial and that's about 2-4 °C lower, with gale winds
i really Hope the new coat i bought IS good
Oh sorry thought ypu were from Barcelona, damn man not even owning a jacket unbelievable
A map comes to mind at first
If I try thinking of words, "Freude Schöner Gotterfunken" is the first that comes to mind lol
I think in images rather than sounding words
And I see the EU buildings and cities' pictures from the continent
People, party extense
People for the whole different cultures and ways to live, party because I'm lucky and met awesome people from all europe and had great times, extense
well I guess I thought of that because in every corner there is something new and worth learning, so there is an inmense collection of stories and places I will never know about
Mine includes cyprus, and fades as It gets to the caucasus and the ural mountains
As usual
i completely forgot iceland
And Spain is orange and about to become red
You feel European
Like, you actually percieve Europe as your land and home
I don't really feel like I belong in Europe, it's more like a continent I have no particular thoughts about, apart from like "eh, my country is there".
I've been browsing it for years and I still can't tell either
I agree on many points actually lmaoo
I find the different cultures really charming and interesting to look into
However what I picture as "my home" sticks to my own country and maybe the neighbors, Italy, France and Portugal
I can't really imagine moving to a more northern country like Germany or even the UK, those for me represent a lifestyle that's too different from mine (even if I consume British media all the time)
I guess that happens to everyone does, bu I still can't bring myself to calling it home
We can change if you want
Let's do an experiment
You are in a faraway exotic country and then some disaster happens (a tsunami, a terrorist attack, zombie apocalypse, it doesn't matter)
You need help to leave the country but there is no Spanish embassy or any kind of diplomatic mission
So you see three embassies: USA, Germany and Nigeria
Which one do you run to
I think I would clearly and automatically run to the German embassy and happily lick the soil of the motherland Europe (~~then they probably wouldn't help me at all, I don't really know how it works~~ [now I'm really worried what would happen if one day I have to ask for help at another EUM embassy, someone knows if it's possible
Edit: in this case, Germany will help me escape the zombie apocalypse and go home, great
Well, in central Spain the sun is up from 8:30-18:30
Cold in the early mornings (some celsius degrees below zero), but once the sun is up, the temperature is way more comfortable (some days there are 20 degrees between the highest and the lowest temperature of the day)
So I cannot complain, apart for the early morning, things are nice
To say some practical things, vitamin D capsules and a daylight lamp help me to keep some of those feelings in check
But I don't know, I really like winter and I enjoy those days when the air bites your face, because it is that cold
It helps to know, that spring is coming eventually
Also I like it when everything slows down a bit
My parents own a farm
Summer and autumn are actually quite stressful with long working hours and little rest
Winter is our time to take it a little bit slower
As an European I cope by being from southern Europe lol
Do you usually get -20C at the coast or is something rare
It seems
I alsways forget how north the south of Finland is
I anyway thought it was a little bit warmer
My brother lives in Trondheim, Norway, and the climate seems milder there, not usually under -10 and almost no wind, as it is inside a fjord
Do the mountains play a role in it too
In Spanish it can mean both things depending on the context
But in Spanish, instead of meaning bored —as in Italian— it means to be lazy
—Example of being brave: *¿Viste cómo pasó por delante del león sin inmutarse
Qué huevazos tiene* **(Did you see how he passed by the lion without blinking
What a balls he has)**
—Example of being lazy: *¿Todo el dia sin hacer nada
Que huevos más gordos tienes* **(All the day doing nothing
What a fat balls you have)**
***Clarification: In Spanish, the word "huevos" can be translated also as "balls", besides its common meaning which is "eggs".***
In a lot of Spanish speaking countries having “Las pelotas hinchadas” (swollen balls) is to be fed up with something to have “Las pelotas bien puestas” (to have the balls well positioned) is to be brave or ballsy and “tener las pelotas muy grandes” (to have very big balls) is to be cheeky or shameless, but in a negative way
Can be you are either brave, or ypu are too entitled
It's the difference between, echale un par de huevos, and vaya par de huevos
We can say "tener los huevos bien gordos", which could be translated as "to have very big balls" (although it cannot be translated very accurately), to reproach someone for having a  shameless behaviour, but "tener huevos" (to have balls) means "to be brave", indeed
Finland is a compound word that comes from:
"Fin", which means "Straightforward".
and
"Land", which means "Enough of this conversation".
Don’t use double negation
It would be better said as : all day doing nothing
"having balls of steel" LOL, best expression ever XD
In Spain the equivalent "estoy hasta los huevos/cojones"
Nope
I have never heard of it
What is its meaning
So, Fin de la Conversación
Co ro na don't
Full of rich people but boring, boring boring in the end
Lots of cool places to retire that have access to shows, culture, nature and other interesting stuff while you can always do a trip to Switzerland to enjoy the landscape or skiing
There are amazing places to retire off the radar like Lisbon, Ljubljana, Freiburg or Heidelberg, Berlin (such a cool city), San Sebastian, ... it depends on your taste
After 8PM everything is shut down during the cold months
Even in cities like Geneva
There have been cases of Euromillions winners that didn't even cashed out the prize for fear
I think it happened in a very small village in Italy, where this person would have been very easily tracked by the mafia
Lesser of evils
It would be even worse in a two party system, but I still have to hold my nose when I vote lmao
From Spain, always the lesser evil, I don't believe in our political system
If I still vote at this point is to keep full blown fascists and ultranationalists off office, but that's a low bar
Everything else is just business as usual with different flavours, so I don't even care, to hell with it all
In the local elections (the mayor of my town), I truly believe in the guy I vote for
He's from a left-wing party but he's done so well these last years that almost everyone in the town votes for him, regardless of their political orientation
Iirc he has 15 out of 21 councillors so he gets like 75% of the votes
In the regional elections, eh
I kinda like the guy I vote for but I'm not 100% sold on him
He's also the guy/pàrty in power and if anything, we did really well in the COVID-19 pandemic, I guess
I'm almost surely going to keep voting for him, so I do respect him
In the national elections, hell no
It's always the lesser evil for me
It's not that I hate all the major political parties, some are okay, but there's huge downsides to all of them from my point of view
Overall I never really "regretted" a vote but more than a few times I've ended up thinking I should have voted for someone else
But in the end I always tend to vote similar parties so it's not true regret, more of a "eh, should have gone with this guy instead".
Given that there's no party running that appeal to all my main believes, I tend to vote for the ones that are more palatable to me, so I guess "the lesser evil"?
Here it actually increased, from the 21% of smokers in 2017 to 23,3% in 2019
The percentage of smokers went from 33,7% in 1995 to 23% in 2014
It went down a few points more but then it went up again to 23% last year
Generally it's perceived as something unhealthy, most people hate the smell and it's forbidden by law in all interior public spaces (bars, restaurants, workplaces
Nice weather
Third most common language
Lowish cost of living
I'm lucky to have a job that lets me work from anywhere
8 years ago, I spent a year studying in London, and after that, I knew that the only place I wanted to live was some big city in Europe
Unfortunately for my plans at the time, it is very difficult to get a visa to live in the UK if you're a young American fresh out of uni
Once I had a work situation that gave me some more flexibility, I began to look for countries where I could get a visa while being able to provide for myself economically
One of the first countries that came up was Spain
I could have likely sorted out a visa to most western European countries, I saw similar visas in Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, but I had been to Spain several times and had Spanish friends from my time in London
I liked that the language was one of the most useful languages world-wide, I liked that Spain generally has better weather than other countries in Western Europe, and the cost of living, even in Madrid is quite reasonable, especially to where I was living in the USA (Hawaii)
I also just liked the Spanish approach to life - lots of personal time, lots of food, lots of wine, lots of social activity, big emphasis on family - which I don't have in Spain, but several friends families take me in for holidays and vacations
I pulled the trigger, which required going to the Spanish consulate in San Francisco twice, and moved here in the autumn of 2015
It's now been over 4
5 years and I don't care to live anywhere else
I've got a solid group of friends, I have a very comfortable apartment that I share with one other guy, I share an office in the city center with some other freelancers, and live a pretty normal life here
My Spanish is really good these days and I feel like I am able to fit into society
I live a much better life here, not even just from an economical standpoint, than I could in the USA or even in the UK
When this coronavirus situation is over, I'll be applying for permanent residency, and hopefully in 5 more years, my passport
Spain isn't for everyone, life is different here than a lot of places and while I did move here on a bit of a whim, it's all worked out for the best and it's the best decision I've ever made
Welcome to Spain
Welcome, amigo
¿La tortilla de patatas con o sin cebolla
Glad you like Spain
Hope you get your permanent residency and, if you finally wish, your citizenship
We have a lot of defects, but I truly think we're a welcoming society
Good luck, and learn as much French as you can beforehand
Lots of bureaucratic tasks to do in France where no one is going to speak English
I've been here for 15 years
I think I'm more Spanish than Canadian at this point
Siempre con
Practice your Spanish
You've earned my love, and we allow you to live here, otherwise we would have kicked you out:)
Don't change a Spanish recipe in front of a Spaniard
It doesn't end well
Jamie Oliver, we still remember you
We don't go everywhere dressed as flamencos
Ffs we have fashion sense
Spain is south of Mexico
(Intense glares)
PREPARE TO DIE
There's more though
Cooking IS a point of national pride so generally that's where you want to hit us
A valencian could potentially Talk an HOUR about what IS and what is not a paella (though what REALLY trigers them is: "valencian IS not a language but a dialect of catalan"  they Burn like fallas)
Finland is the ballsack of scandinavia
And no spaniard would ever shout "Viva la France", due to silly country rivalty or whatever you may call it
Yeah, in spanish IS a bit weird, because the low countries IS the name of the netherlands
but historically it's also the name of flanders which includes belgium
What i'm trying to say is that I think there's historical reasons for the mix up
If anyone knows something more feel free to tell me
I'm ready for your undiying hate, but if anyone asked me I would say eastern europe
I guess I lack the historical knowledge to mark it as central and not eastern europe, but if you are in the right part of the map you are eastern for me
_Ah yes, I start to feel the rage of polish readers through the screen_
I swear if one more valenciano starts with the "that's arroz con cosas" for a pretty acceptable paella-like plate I will stamp their face in the socarrat
In Spain we say "La republica Checa" (the Czech Republic)
In Spanish too, I guess it comes from the time that was part of the Spanish empire and because it's been the most influential regions
Currently they're promoting to change it to Netherlands (países bajos) which was an existing term but not nearly as popular
It seems fair after mispronouncing it for so many centuries
In Spanish most people call it "Holanda" but the official name is "Los paises bajos" which means the Low lands
Yeah, I heard they have a lot of venomous animals
I would never live there lol
>socarrat
Noooo that's the BEST part
_I see you are a man of culture as well_
(sharpens the knife furiously)
_The true paella lover is not the one who fights over silly details, but the one who apreciates the socarrat no matter what is made of_
look man I'm not even mad anymore, I just wish I could make a good burrito by myself
Edit: yes, with my latino knife
The median age of my country is 44 years, being one of the countries which has the oldest people
That we have a small desert in the Iberian Peninsula
It's called Bardenas Reales (it's in Navarra (Spain)) if you are curious
I think some films were recorded there
I've heard in a podcast that since the iberian and italian peninsulas were highly romanized, they had better sewage systems than the rest of europe during the medieval period, and that the stereotypical dirty medieval city from movies is only accurate for cities outside those regions
They also said in that podcast that christian cities in iberia were highly autonomous nearly to the same degree than city-states in Italy
It is also the feminine form of "limón" the Spanish word for lemon, which make some sense as they come from identical trees (although this doesn't make much sense because "limón" comes from an Arab word)
It also wouldn't make sense because "limón" doesn't have feminine, although I get what you meant
In a full beach you will always see at least one or two topless women, which will probably shock someone not used to it
It's still about 10% like everyone else is saying
Fun fact: it's probably much closer to 50% when they are 60+ years old
It's not the same natives and tourists (tourists tend to do it more often since no one they know will see them), and it's not the same a public beach or a private pool
In Mallorca among natives and in public beaches I'd say 5-10%
I'm from the north part of Spain (Galicia), and the % is very low, it's very extrange to see someone doing it, I would say 1 in 250 women, or something like that
I live in the south of Spain
The percentage of women with bewbs out on the beach is around 30%. Keeping in mind a lot of those women are tourists, the percent of Spanish women with their bewbs out is more like 60%
I'd like to point out it's the older generations of women that sunbathe in Spain
I'd say it's still a rather common practice
From my experience it's about 30 to 40%
Yup, i think 50 % is *way* too much, that means that about half of women go topless, and  that doesn't happen, at least not the beaches i got to
And there's also a difference between beaches and pools, i barely ever see topless women, whereas in the beaches you can usually see a few
But 20% still seems like a lot to me, maybe more like 10% from my experience, since i've been to really crowded beaches and only seen a few
Am Spanish and woman
Yeah no, definitely not 50/100, much closer to a sixth or possibly a fifth
The more crowded the beach is, the lower the proportion of topless women is
It's rare but I have actually seen over 50%, but that's in beaches where you can stay 5 to 10 meters away of anybody else
Agree
Also, women that do topless don't do it all the time or on the same beaches
Some of my friends will go topless on a city beach and some of them will only go topless in more quiet, less crowded beaches
So it depends on the location as well, and I will respect ss topless in tourist beaches or public pools
> 0% is just ridiculous, it would mean that middle-aged women do topless too
They do it all the time, at least in the Mediterranean
I'd dare to say more than the younger ones
As some other fellows have posted here, the older you get, the less fucks you give
Actually I think that middle aged and old women topless way more than young women
Not much, most of the time parents buy one classic set to their kids (40€)
It's much less common to buy your kid the collectionists' sets as they're more expensive (100-150€)
Back in the day, here in Spain LEGO had a local competitor called TENTE, who had smaller pieces and was cheaper
Production stopped in 2007
(Spain)
It's not cheap, that's for sure
Some decent sets, either franchise or creator are between 10€ and 50€, but expect to spend more than 100-200€ on most of them
Most expensive ones go for 300-500€ or even more
I'd say they are relatively expensive, but I love them because it's basically unlimited fun once you or your kids have them
For some reason I understood middle English better that the early modern one, maybe it's just me
I can understand basically all of the early and middle but I don't understand a single word from old onwards
The reason I understand the early and middle it's because it sounds like when Spaniards speak English for their first time and from there I basically approximate it
Also because of manga characters that speak like that lmao
Middle English is like poorly spoken English by a Spaniard lmao
The revolt of Los comuneros in 1521
I'm letting you do the research, because it's a LONG one
But really, *really* cool
Do you guys literally celebrate an attempted terrorist attack
Spain's bonfire night is the night of 23rd to 24th of June, Saint John's Eve
But, we have many, many holidays and festivals around the country
Fallas, Moros y Cristianos, Tomatina, San Fermin
In Spain, St John/ San Juan is celebrated in almost any place that has a beach
The tradition is to wash your face in the sea at midnight to attract good luck, burn the bad ones in a bonfire (papers with messages about the bad things that have happened during the year, for example) and then jump over it three times, to scare away all the bad things
Surely there are different traditions in each place, these are the ones I know
PS: You also drink and eat a lot
We celebrate the arrival of plagues, rape and death to half of a continent by the hand of careless power-hungry douchebags
Not that much of a difference
He goy his revenge with people buying V for Vendetta masks
True, I ate half the sentence when writing, will edit rn
Rajoy has some hits
[It's very difficult todo esto]  is master Spanglish
And when [he doesn't even try]  it's even funnier
But I have to go with [this]  You might be thinking that's some good English right there, but plot twist
>!...it wasn't him talking, he was being dubbed by a native speaker
[Ana Botella] was the Mayor of Madrid at the time
This was her speech defending the candidature for the Olympic games in 2013
Every spaniard remembers the phrase 'a relaxing cup of café con leche in Plaza Mayor'.
You may haven't seen this outside Spain, but we have a video OF NOT OTHER THAN FUCKING FRANCO butchering english like the half brain moron he was, enjoy it
This is the famous one and still a joke when you want to offer someone a cup of coffe
Ana Botella Mayor of Madrid (2011 - 2015) talking to the Olypic committee
-Minute 1:40- the most memorable part
A relaxing cup of café con leche in the puerta del sol
Every spanish person knows this quote
Well, Franco spoke such an awful English that you cannot understand a single [thing]
Relaxi café con leche in Plaza Mayor by Ana Botella
The words are English but the soundis 100% German
Tbh I understand him much better than I usually understand people with a British accent
Maybe I should take up my English lessons again
You probably don't know that this [living legend] exists
The subtitles make it even better lmao
Emilio Botin and Abel Caballero are a close second
Whaaaat
How had I never seen the video of the Valencian guy
Lol, he is shameless
The voice is clearly a British person, did he think he could fool people
She was criticized in Madrid, kind of becoming a meme, but the truth is 'café con leche' can be used in English just the way 'café au lait' and 'caffe latte' can (ever seen a Starbucks menu
) The only thing remarkable about the way she speaks is that's it's sort of forced and unnatural, as if someone were trying to slowly recite something from memory in school
Overall, it's much better than others linked here
The remix was [awesome
I see your Ana Botella and show my [Franco
Oh also we have some more modern assholes to laugh at, some years ago this video went viral  of the Madrid mayor being a fucking moron too
We also had our previous president Rajoy, which was notorious because he couldn't even make a full phrase in spanish without messing up and looking like a kid with learning issues, he also completly butchered english, i mean he cant even speak proper spanish so no surprise there isn't that many videos because he ended up avoiding any conversation in english embarrasibg himself when he had to treat with international figures
relaxing cup of C*a*fe **Co**N lEs^(he)
Oh my god it doesn't even sound real, it looks straight out of a sitcom
How did I not know about that
It just made my day
Thank you my friend
El "subtitulado" lo hace aún mejor
This is so good
Her accent is atrocious and I wonder if native speakers of English would understand her, but she gave it a good try
It's strange, I had the feeling he was quite fluent the first 30 seconds but when he said "botar os marcos dos apartamentos" (?), I realized I had no idea what he was talking about anymore
But mad respect for Costa for standing up for Spain with the Covid19 budget issue
Hahaha, it isn't that bad, it's obvious that he's not native
Although the accent itself is good, you can notice that he's "inventing" few words or forming some sentences in ways that aren't natural in Spanish
but I could understand the 100% of what he said :)
Thank you
I thought nobody was going to link that
She's been a meme for years although it isn't that bad
I dislike this woman profoundly, but I think she did a good job here and I like that she said a few words in Spanish, she wanted her speech to have a Spanish flavour
I think that was a great choice for the context
I'm dead
That "Viva España" was like we are donde with this shit
Also, this gem in the comments:
> Franco no hacía el workbook
I am surprised nobody mentioned Sergio Ramos
The pronunciation may not be the worst, especially considering other examples in this thread
But I fucking hate the discourse
It sounds like it was written by a 5 year old
Spaniard here: I can only understand a few words, it's really difficult to decipher even for us
Spanish politics has become very polarized, and people will jump on anything if they get to criticize the opposite party
She became a proper meme for a month with many people who disliked her making fun of that: 'café con leche'. Honestly seeing echoes of the US's approach to politics now
Everything's very tribal, and sensibility is being put aside in favour of supporting your party, whatever it says/does in opposition to all others
Well apart of the american colonization which is pretty famous, another atrocity that isn't that well known is that spaniards captured about 14
000 frenchmen (Napoleon invaded Spain, Spain started fightin, won and made prisoners), 4
000 were sent to the Canary Islands and they had a pretty good time there, but the other 10
000 were sent to the Balearic Islands, and when they arrived to Mallorca the people didn't want 10
000 french soldiers there, so they brought them to a desert island, Cabrera, not too big, 16 km\^2 and not too far away from the main island, Mallorca, only 60 km, but enough to make the escape impossible
At first the spaniards brought food and water every day, but there was a storm and spaniards couldnt bring food and water to the frenchmen, so 8 days later, when they went there, french tried to steal the ship, some spaniards died but they could scape, since that day nobody wanted to go fed the frenchmen and they stayed without food nor water in a desert island for 3 months until the next ship went there
A lot of them died from starvation, others had to eat their own shit, a total disaster, and there were cannibalism as well
Only 3600 frenchmen out of 10000 survived and were liberated 5 years after they were captured when Spain and France signed the peace
It's considered the first concentration camp, 130 years before Hitler's (1809-1814)
Well
I can only say that nobody expected it
In 1936, a lot of people who were said to be "supporters of the sublevation" were put in prison, with any sentence at all
They were later brought from the prisons to be executed in what became known as "sacas". There were a total of 33, between the 7th of November and 4th of December
This incident is known as "Matanzas de Paracuellos" and It costed around 12
000 lives
Another interesting one is the mass execution in Badajoz, during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)
After the "National" forces, as they called themselves, also known as the Blue forces lead by Lieutenant Colonel Yagüe took the city of Badajoz, they took the prisoners to the bullring (between 1800 and 4000 people, though sources vary) and  executed them, if not there at the cemetery
This gained Lieutenant Yagüe the title of "El Carnicero de Badajoz", the butcher of Badajoz
Also not contempt with that they kept the mass sacking, raping and murdering for another week or so
The blue forces then burnt all the bodies whether they were militiamen or civilians to "not leave any enemies on their rear".
I'd argue that Spain has committed atrocities far, far more bloody and inhumane than the Inquisition
It's not that it wasn't a thing, but I'd say its legend overweights its reality by a lot
Sorry for the link, I'm on mobile
Edit: typos because of mobile -_-
The things the Francoists did in the civil war as a whole rank very high in the list of atrocities in and by Spain
The civil war in general was absolutely baffling in terms of the brutatlity by both sides, but especially by Franco during and after the war
Let's not forget that Yagüe still has a village named after him, San Leonardo de Yagüe where he's buried, which last year held a ceremony to honor him
Yes, civil war was brutal, in Paracuellos, the republican or red forces (the good ones) killed in cold blood between 1
000 and 12
000 people (sources vary), unarmed prisoners
000 of them were incarcerated before the war even began, so they didnt commit any war crimes at all, and they were killed in cold blood anyway, the others were right-wing civilians, catholic priests and military made prisoners
What a massacre considering they were the heroes of the story fighting the devil itself (blue or national force)
Many many families are still in the process of finding each other
The guy was later interviewed regarding this specific event at what he responded:
"Of course we killed them, what did you expect
That I would take four thousand red prisoners with me, while my column had to advance on a race against the clock
Or that I would free them behind me and leave Badajoz to turn red again
And while he did have a point, it seems like he felt no remorse whatsoever for what he did
Despacito it was our fault after all
Spanish colonization wiped out most of the natives in America
Spanish Inquisition was quite fucked up
Well, there are some things, I wouldn't know how to choose
-Expelling the jews of Spain
-Taking part in the slave business in Africa
-The illnesses we took with us to America, where people was not accustomed to live near cattle and did not have the antibodies, but that was not voluntary
-Allow the Sahara people to be attacked by Morocco, after it stopped being a colony
Something
unexpected
Isn't Luis Fonsi Puerto Rican, though
Just reggaeton in general
̶T̶̶b̶̶h̶ ̶m̶̶o̶̶s̶̶t̶ ̶n̶̶a̶̶t̶̶i̶̶v̶̶e̶̶s̶ ̶d̶̶i̶̶e̶̶d̶ ̶d̶̶u̶̶e̶ ̶t̶̶o̶ ̶t̶̶h̶̶e̶ ̶d̶̶i̶̶s̶̶e̶̶a̶̶s̶̶e̶̶s̶
And without the Spanish empire
Give me a break
I cannot remember everything, I had totally forgotten about that
Yeah as I recall there were many extreme-right/fascist parties in Germany at the time and Hitler just brought the NSDP to the top of the pile
In my opinion even without Hilter a fascist government would’ve taken hold of Germany but we’ll never know how things go from there
YES, YES, WE DO
Well, kind of, and I thing it's only in my region
We have "Azogue", which if you look it up you'll find it's an adjective for a very nervous person
That's in the context of " It's sunday evening, I am bored, I can't go anywhere because everything is closed, nothing good on the TV
", so you just move around your house anxiously
But we use it as a noun, more than an adjective
I'm from south Alicante, so there's influence from both Murcia and Valencia
However I do think this word is from my neighboring towns, though
What really ancient tradition you still practice
For example here, the 24th June we make fires all over the place, we jump them at least 9 times ("to put demons away" they say) and we decorate our houses with certain plants
From what I know, this tradition has a Celtic origin
An Spanish that doesn't like Iberian ham
*That is me
A Spaniard who hates football and bullfighting
This literally triggers me
This hurts on a spiritual level
Now we're 2 of us
That's a great idea to promote cycling
Cross-country or alpine
Me too
I completely understand you
El sol (male) = The Sun
Helios (Greek god) = Sol (Roman god)
La luna (female) = The Moon
Selene (Greek goddess) = Luna (Roman goddess)
I had curiosity about Old English (before genders disappeared)
Sunne (femenine)
mōna (masculine)
Similar to German (It makes sense, they are cognates)
EL sol, Sun (masculine) and LA luna, Moon (feminine)
El Sol (male) La Luna (female)
Reason: *R* *O* *M* *A* *N* *S*
This has to be Roman/Greek heritage
The Moon are the goddesses Selene/Luna and Diana/Artemis and the Sun is the god Helios/Sol and Apollo
I'd be surprised if it were otherwise haha
The Spanish Golden Time, also called "The Golden Century" (although it lastsd more than 100 years)
1492-1659/1981 was a time where Spain rose not only as an Empire, but also in architecture, paintings, music, literature
so this artistic aspect together with the political and strategical development of the country is considered to be the golden age
Note: if it was only the expanse of the empire I wouldn't consider it the golden age, it's the development in arts what gives it the touch
After the discovery of America, we literally just started making churches with golden interiors
If that's not golden age I don't know anymore
When the Dutch got independence that's when things went downhill
From 1492 until the 16th century or so, basically the Spanish Empire, where the sun never sets
Many Spanish mention the Siglo de Oro, which I agree with, but personally living in Andalusia and having seen the Alhambra and Mosque of Córdoba, I have to mention the early-middle times of Muslim rule as very prosperous and prolific in terms of wealth, science, philosophy and art
The Empire may have reached farther, but it stood on very deep roots, which grew during that time
Figuratively and literally too
note: I meant up to the year 1681, not 1981 (just in case)
We use it in spanish too
Oh yes indeed, that is also a small "golden time" for art in Spain, specially with the Generation of '27 and other poets / writers
This was a generation of artists with great influence and legacy, in a time where Spaniards has to redefine who they were as a nation, but is indeed a short period of time that is generally overshadowed by the war afterwards
I don't believe it's an unpopular opinion, and it should have more considerance because it has a great legacy
I just thought of the Siglo de Oro as the prime example of golden time
I politely disagree
The Generation of '27 (1927) flourished in a time of crisis, both spiritual  and political / economical
Their themes in novels and poetry usually make references to "who we really are as a nation", decadence and a search for something else, making it a special time for art and literature in Spain
That's why it's usually referred to as the Silver age
I have some
One was on my first roadtrip throughout Europe
Me and a friend were traveling extremely cheap for a number of reasons, we had terrible bank numbers but we needed to get away for a while so badly, so whatever, we camped and slept in the car for most of the trip
We didn't have significant trouble, maybe some homeless people or drunk bums forcing us out or landowners asking us to leave, but all good
Until one night in Romania, near Craiova, we set a tarmac in what seemed to be like a reasonably secluded stretch of woods, and left the car 50m away
We woke up in the night because we heard some noises, and a random group of people were literally tearing the car apart by smashing it
We shouted and they began to chase us for a bit, then left, but we RAN
We fled as we could (slashed tires), reported to the police, and sorted out the papers to scrap my buddy's car
They didn't even stole anything, just damaged the car to a point were it was lost cause
We took buses and hitchhiked back home
I enjoyed Romania a lot, will go back if I can, but I won't set foot on that city ever again
Crazy folks I tell you
The post is 7 hours old and not a single bad hotel experience in Spain
Nice
Although at least 2 muggings in Barcelona, little surprise there
I live in Benidorm so
not vacation but people in vacation
Sketchy place indeed, but there is crazy people everywhere, could have happened in Madrid for that matter
I really liked Romania, beautiful scenery and rich history, just a scary experience among many other excellent ones
Oh, I did
We were heading for Bucharest to decide whether we continued to Bulgaria or ended the trip
We didn't actually meant to visit Craiova (no offense), but toured Cluj, Brasov, Sibiu, Sighisoara and more, crossed the mountains after a few days and were just very tired so we slept there, that's why
I've never been mugged, but walking by the Sagrada Familia might have been the closest call
My memory is fuzzy but I remember a group of young odd-looking guys following us for a couple minutes
I think the worst hotel I've been to was probably a youth hostel in London, which had tiny rooms, cold showers and a stairwell barely sufficient for one person going up and one person going down, which must have served around 5-6 floors
My 'worst' experience (although the journey itself was a blast) is probably when I left my stuff at a bus in Florence
I remembered to take my backpack but left a small travel pouch that had several cool mementos plus my wallet, so I was stranded without ID
I realised just as the bus took off and went running to the "garage" (the place were buses stay after they finish travelling for the day), which was sadly closed by less than 10 minutes
Then I spent the next day travelling up and down Florence to find a police station to get the document I needed for getting into my flight, which was that same evening
Finally after going to THREE police stations, because the first two were only city police and thus not able to process my request (?) I got the Carabinieri to file what I needed filed and was able to return home
I tell you, no tourist had ever crossed the streets I have in Florence
If this were an open world game, I would have glitched the map
Anyways, I'm still alive, every time I travel I get paranoid about my cards/passport and I unfortunately never got to finish the book that I kept in that bag
That sucks too
Here's to travels without troubles (after the virus)
Cheers
We have a restaurant in the very center, in Plaza Mayor, called "Las cuevas de Luis Candelas". Luis Candelas was a bandit born in the center of Madrid too, well known because he didn't kill nor injured and also shared his loot
To attract the many tourists that pass through the area, at the door of the restaurant, it has been a tradition for many years, there is a man dressed as the daring bandit
In addition, he carries a blunderbuss, the traditional weapon at the time
Two rookie Municipal Policemen stopped the patrol car and asked the disguised guy, at the door of the restaurant, if he had a license to carry the weapon
The man tried to explain to them that he was only in disguise and that the blunderbuss was disabled but he made the mistake of telling them that there were many more old weapons inside the restaurant
The Municipal Police returned to the car, requested reinforcements, put on bulletproof vests and immobilized the fake bandit while waiting for help to arrive, disregarding the comments and appreciations a numerous crowd was trying to make them understand
When the reinforcements arrived, they couldn't believe the stupidity of the two brats
**Edit**: [The fake Luis Candelas]
Potsdam
Edit: It’s interesting that he died months before coming back there for the Conference after WWII ended
The entire north of spain is beautiful and with awesome beaches but people just want the sun^(tm)
for anyone interested in the roman empire or pre-roman cultures theres lots of spots that are quite comfortable to visit
Theres lots of medieval stuff too
I dont understand why brits all go to the south in summer, wich is scorching hot
I'd rather be in northern spain in summer where theres a comfortable 20º to 30ºC weather
Trust me, the north is full of tourists, specially french people
Yesterday I was walking on the main Street of my city and There were more tourists than actual native people
I think the most underrated places are in the interior part of the country, such as Extremadura and the Castillies
Really wonderful places that even spanish people forget about
I love Asturias
Salamanca is very beautiful too, although I might be biased as I live here haha
Y demos gracias de que no esté como el Mediterráneo, así podemos disfrutarlo mucho mejor
I am from the basque country and the cities of bilbao and san sebastian are cool
Good food (i wouldn't call it fusion really) but expensive
The entire north of spain has some amazing products
In terms of beauty tho, cantabria-asturias are muuuuuch prettier
And la mancha has some cool places with castles and stuff and toledo is beautiful but the landscape is boring as hell
I live in Salamanca and there are actually more foreign people than one may think, mainly students on Erasmus and such
Vigo is sooo fun and the food is great
Applicabel to all galicia
Yeah vitoria is tiny but you can easily find flights to bilbao, the biggest city in the region
They are so freaking cool looking
A "road trip" from bilbao to san sebastia along the coast road is one of the best things you can do in basque country
The entire northern coast of spain is gorgeous tho
I know it pretty well and my favorite spot is the hidden beach of Sonabia, in cantabria
A huge grassy cliff over an awesome beach
Perfect for surf too
Absolutely
Asturias and Cantabria are really beautiful
Can't recommend them enough
There are also many interesting cities across Spain with a lot of museums, monuments and beautiful architecture
Madrid, Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Granada, Santiago, Salamanca, Soria, Córdoba and more
How did you know where I was from
*joke
But yes, once I went to a country house in Picos de Europa and it was such an amazing place
And nobody was there
I mean that's just a kind of paella
Your friends did something weird hahaah
What's typical about the basque country (or tbh used to since it spreaded to other places a couple decades ago) is the pintxos
Litoe portions of food but that inlike tapas you pay for them
In certian places they are a bit fusion and a bit more creative
That's what tourists love about san sebastian for instance
Take it from a basque
The modern nationalist movements were based in a romantization of a past that never existed like how catalans talk about pthings that never existed like the catalan countries or the catalano-aragonese confederation when in fact it was just the crown if aragon
And if you researchbadque nationalism you'll see the father of basque nationalism was a disgusting racist
I mean research of you want but you won't find the same stuff you irish people have haha
I  lived in the basque country for 18 years and in catalonia for 3
I saw the dame shit in both places, a political movement that splits the population between the good ones and the bad ones
You may know more than the average bit you still know shit about it
Both of those nationalisms have made both cstalans and basques into sheep that just follow what their leaders say
It's a cultural brainwashing and it's disgusting
Now i live in madrid and omg it feels good to be free and not being judged for what i believe in
Please keep this kind of tweeter arguments out of Reddit
I've lived in both sides
A litle bit of nationalism is ok, more than a litle bit makes the population into retards with superiority complex
Between the 2 spanish nationalism is muuuch milder and inclusive
I'm not kidding when i tell you that the hardcore nationalists treat other spaniards like shit
If you're specifically looking to work in Germany or Switzerland, then German is the clear choice
Job market wise, those two are good places to look, however the language is only really useful there
If you're looking for flexibility I'd say continue with French or maybe try Spanish
Both of those languages are not only spoken in their own country but are also very popular in other regions of the world
They also give you a good base, with Spanish you can get by or at least communicate with Portuguese, Italian and to a degree French speakers
If you were to move to any of the regions that speak those languages you could pick them up much more quickly than if you chose German for example
I live in Mallorca so German is almost as important as English, but it's super hard and I'm ashamed of trying to speak it knowing that I suck
Thankfully 80% of the germans clients I've had so far speak Spanish fairly well
In Spain, apart from english, many places loook for french and maybe portuguese
Don't be modest, the correct answer is German
Agree
Also German would help you learning Dutch, and French,  Italian and Spanish
No, Italian accent for Spanish it's quite distinct
Perhaps the musicality is somehow similar but that's all
Demographics has nothing to do if the industries doesnt move to Poland as well
Look at India, same population as China (aprox) but on no way as relevant because China attracts and creates industry hubs
In Germany car brand alone (BMW, Mercedes Daimler, Audi, VW, etc
) are difficult to top
German banks and Insurance companies (Allianz), Medical industry (Bayer), Air industry (Lufthansa, Airbus), clothes (Nike and Adidas), food distribution (Lidl, Aldi) and many more industries have their HQ in Germany creating a heavy focus on the country being the biggest economy of EU
Like even if Poland grows in population, unless there is the same growth (and It has to be very high, not just 2-3% of gdp) in economic industries, I don't see your scenario happening
From the top of my head I'd say [this ] of Laura Pausini, she has a very good Spanish thought
For a thicker Italian accent maybe try to find some Ancelotti press conference when he was the Real Madrid manager
italian IS actually way older than most people think
Starting roughly in the renaissance
People fry eggs with butter
This seems stupid but blew my mind, butter
Here we do It with olive oil
The nordics are surprisingly funny, and play into each others countries constantly and i LOVE It
There's a large pecentage of portuguese in Luxembourg
It was like 10%? I mean, why
Once i got a detailed explanation of the political landscape of poland from a polish
i treasure It
Definetely one of the reasons i'm in this sub, getting first hand accounts on news about Europe
How increadibly rigid id the korean society around dating
From an American/swiss Who lived in seoul
We also have drying cabinets in Spain
We have plate drying racks above the sink in Spain too
There's an enormous percentage of portuguese in Andorra too
It is illegal to pick mushrooms in some areas of Spain unless you have a permit
It's to prevent people from picking mushrooms illegally
You have to cut them at the stem with a knife and carry them in a basket or box with tiny holes so some spores will fall as you take them away; some illegal mushroom pickers don't do that, so now permits are required for it
>While teaching English in pretty much almost every non-English-speaking countries, Dora teaches Spanish in Romania
That's amazing
>Germans and Swiss really are living stereotypes when it comes to giving overly detailed answers
that's so true
hmm, In what sense
There's a lot
If you go to very remote places on the countryside you can find roads with potholes here as well
There are also some old, badly paved highways, that they end up fixing eventually, but it takes forever
I'm guessing up there -10º is hot is the equivalent of the 35º is cold here
I try to do the same, ghee when Indian, butter when northern, but the rest gets either olive oil or sunflower
Other oils are a bit HARDER to find an then there's canola
It's actually REALLY hard to get canola oil in Spain
And we know why
There was a huge medical emergency in 1981
Some genius added canola oil for industrial use with the one sold for consumption, apparently to cut costs
The only problem IS that it's neurotoxic, affected over 20
000 people and killed 1100
So the oil still has kind of a bad rep around here
Because it's cheaper, healthier and has a nice flavour
But i Guess in sweeden it's more expensive and with no flavour at all
I tried It, it's nice, but i won't be doing It again
I like olive oil better
Butter gives a nice subtle sweetness and acidity which IS good, kind of milky
Olive oil IS much more flavourfull, more acidic, just a tad bitter, a hint of spiciness, there's much more going on
It just tastes great
It's a completely different experience and though butter does work really well with eggs i have to give It to olive oil
If i wanted to make a creamy subtle Dish i would go with butter
Try frying eggs with olive oil, you'll LOVE it
I think i'm gonna try butter today
then i can finally say olive oil IS best
Well the thing IS that Italy IS a very modern country and many people have at least Heard that they have a few dialects
So many just assume that the language was created as a lingual franca of sorts during the unification
It has actually happened in Other places (for example Indonesia) but not Italy
I didn't know
So they're just everywhere in Europe
I just found It weird
Why of all places Luxembourg
I know the germans promoted turkish inmigration and i vaguely remember that sweeden gave assilum to somalians (though i might be wrong)
but why the hell did the portuguese go in mass to Luxembourg
And why only the portuguese
I remember that in Ireland they've got a good share of polish, while in Spain romanians are much more common
This kind of things usually stem from somewhere
So if you know more, do tell
To tomato sauce, no
That'd be like making croissants with olive oil
You just LOVE your butter
In Spain you usually need a permit, to prevent bad practices
Don't forget not selling out to oil companies
It's basically a must for them
Some years ago I went with a friend to Hockenheimring, the F1 circuit in Germany, and it was a cold and windy morning, we were waiting for the exhibition races to start, my friend and I with a pair of jackets were suffering
after a while I see two finns wearing a t-shirt and enjoying the "summer", they even bought a pair of icecreams, that day I decided that people from Finland are White Walkers
Michael Schumaker won the race, fuck you Raikkonen, go eat some icecream with vodka :)
I've seen those in Spain, but the drying rack in the cabinet, usually called [escurreplatos] , is more common
They're are one of the countries in Europe with more people living abroad, like 30 per cent
It's insane
You gotta keep flowing those dollars
Holy shit
\-10º is basically a new ice age, water freezing, kids freezing, everything freezing and we basically dig under layers of blankets and proceed to hibernate until that's basically over
35º C is a cold summer day here
Hahahaahah this is like when tourist come here in summer, and while we are wearing swimsuits, they are somehow wearing jackets
To be fair they are also wearing swimsuits and flip-flops with sockets so I don't know what to say haha
p.s. Vettel ftw :P
Ohhh sounds more like "papapapapapapapapapapapagiiiiiii"
High temperature IS justified but why low temperature implies butter
You can Cook with oil at low temperatures
For example tomato sauce IS made with OLIVE OIL
though i've Heard of a polish Guy that uses butter . The thing IS that our food tastes to olive oil and yours to butter
And that's that
Then there's limits, for example butter Burns easily because It's rich in proteins
If you want those proteins then butter IS mandatory (making buttermilk, for examole)
if you don't want them you can use oil or simply clarify the butter
in the end it comes down to taste
And butter has a very distinctive taste
As do "unrefined" oils
For example in shichuanese cuisine the norm IS unrefined rapeseed oil, which apparently has a mustardy flavour
Spanish cuisine has 4 key ingredients, olive oil, garlic, onion and salt
That makes sense
Well, there's actually no need for them because tomato sauce thickens by itself
so tomato sauce doesn't need any emulsion (which IS mostly done to thicken sauces)
In fact most recipees ask to get the sauce out when the oil has completely separated from the rest
meaning the complete opposite of emulsified
And i'm sorry, but i don't know marcella harzan (just looked her Up) and americans know nothing of italian food, so i'm....half-jokingly questioning her work
Though butter IS used surprisingly often in Italian cooking, way more than in spanish
What part of Spain are you in where 35° C is a cold summer day, the hottest I remember it getting here in canarias is around like 40° C.
I'll try It, seems like a nice trick
Holy shit, I want to try that someday man like being cold-proof in a cold place
LMAO Where can I see that
haha
In murcia, but also andalusia so its pretty common reach that temperatures
By the way, someone asked me this and i wasn't sure
You know that butter IS waaaaaay less healthy than olive oil, right
Recently, Francisco Franco
Historically, probably King charles the IV, a hot turd of a king
One is not enough
[Can I help you to make up your mind
I think that Charles IV and Fernando VII go hand in hand
Sport-wise: Mauro Tassotti
Currently, many politicians hit by corruption cases: Bárcenas, Pujol, Aguirre, Villarejo (police officer), etc
Bonus track: The monarchy, especially Juan Carlos I and his son in law Iñaki Urdangarín.
Like father like son
People actually wanted Fernando VII back
How from Felipe V or Carlos III, who were effective administrators and statesmen (despite Felipe being kind of a dick), then came three totally fucked up generations with Carlos IV, Fernando VII, Don Carlos and Isabel II
And finally when came a decent one in the shape of Alfonso XII, he dies after just 11 years
Yeah but he had a mental illness
It was not his fault he was a gentic fuckup
He (well, his mother Marianne of Austria and his later ministers after Marianne's death) was actually better than his father and grandfather
The economy could recover a little and it was a rather peaceful era
Until he dies, of course
Philip the II here is considere among the best, if not the best
I am of the opinion that the republic was a huuuuuge mess and that they coul'd have never ever won the war
So saying "if they had won" makes no sense
And the fact that the republic might have been somewhat better than franco makes no sense either, since franco was the one that actually won and the one that was a dictator for 40 years
He's hated with reasons
Sadly, Stalin has supporters in Russia that see him as a WW2 hero and great leader
Because they didn't know what kind of king he was
He was just the person to rally for if you were against Charles IV and Napoleon
He made true the saying "Más vale malo conocido que bueno por conocer".
Well, when playing for Madrid, if you don't support them, yes
But then, when playing for Spain, not at all
He is the captain
Meant the IV
Genocide of the basques
Wtf are you talking about
I'm basque and there was no genocide
And he was not a nice guy
He was a dictator
Not as brutal as others physivally but ideologically he was a cancer to spain
Yeah lol, genocide is a strobg word
I'd say it depends on the person and I will give you 2 examples:
Michael Robinson, a guy that has been living and working in Spain since 1990 and has an obvious british accent even 30 years later
This youtuber that has been living in Spain for 3 years and speaks Spanish with almost no accent
EDIT: Just to clarify, everyone LOVES Michael Robinson, specially people who is interested in football (he was a  football player and since 1990 he is a football commentator), having an accent is not a problem at all
There was a fake rumour not long ago that he passed away due to coronavirus and everyone was devastated
The Spanish response has been perfect but one extra thing that should be said is the speed
Spanish people can speak incredibly fast
If you can reach that level you'll reach peak Spanish proficiency
In Spanish the standard neutral accent and grammar are not easy but neither impossible,with time it can be done but if you try and learn more specific accents from Spain, good luck my friend
The most difficult thing you will encounter are words with missing letter for no apparent reason and words that get added syllables to them
Never seen anyone nailing the ñ
Grammar has some tricky things
Then there’s the “to be” verb which has to different verbs in Spanish
Accent will be by far the most difficult, even more depending on the area
I did it when I was 14 so
Wait,did a british person just learned to speak spanish
Greeks are the only ones that can pass as Spanish, since their phonetics are so similar to ours
My mother speaks Italian because her father worked in Switzerland in the summers so she would go with her brothers and thus learned Italian,the only bad part is that she only knows how to speak it,not write it
I tried to learn the language because it's almost as important as English here in Mallorca and the sentence I will never forget is: "Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache"
_Spanish intensifies_
Like the southern accent
(I mean, any if the southern accents)
Well, in 2014 we had 236,669 brits living in Spain, I guess more than one learnt the language lol
I has a Greek guide when I visited Greece with my HS and I thought he was Spanish the first three days
That's true, many speak it perfectly
It's impressive
Italians, Portuguese and Romanians have a big advantatge
But it ultimately depends on the person, how perfectionist one is and the age they had when they moved to Spain
A kid from those countries that arrives before 12 years old will speak the language perfectly, no doubt
Totally true
It is amazing how well romanians speaks spanish, and how well they integrate in Spain
I have Romanian friends and they speak impeccable Spanish
I can only ever hear the faintest differences in some specific sounds, and very occasionnally
I often forget Spanish is not their mother tongue
The key word is living,not speaking Spanish lmao
It was the same for me
But italians sing a different melody when you speak, it's not the pronunciation but the entonation of the sentence (and that's why a lot of spaniards, men and women love italians, that "melody" is very pleasant to hear)
Unless you have been here for a really long time, we can hear your accent
Also the intonation is different
When I went to Greece, I always thought I was hearing Spanish around me (it wasn't)
In Portugal, it sounds like Portuguese
Yeah, italians are the ones having the easiest time pronouncing Spanish
And most of them sound nativelike, Laura Pausini is a good example, and I believe she learnt Spanish when she was already an adult and now she's part of tv shows in Spain like "The Voice" and she has almost no accent
Learning how to pronounce as a native:
Greeks, Italians > Portuguese, Romanians > The rest of the world
As a fun fact argentinians have a melody while speaking very similar to italians and there's a saying that says "Los argentinos son italianos que hablan español" both because of the way they speak and because they have a lot of italian blood
Weird
Even though in Spanish the expression that would be used in that sentence is 'década' (just like decade), I feel like 'tens of years' sounds better than decades in this case
I definitely thought that 'tens of years' was a very valid expression in English
There was a time when most of people in Europe worked 12 hours 6 days a week
As I see it, now, the technology let us produce much more than before
This is just my opinion, but I think we are producing too much and we are destroying our planet
This is one of the reasons why I believe is a good idea to reduce to 4 days, we can afford reduce our production and still living good enough while respect our  planet  home
Yes
There is still a lot of room for many companies to redistribute workload and benefits
It makes sense that with increase in productivity we should be able to make that more people can live better working less
That isn't very German of you
Add The muslim world too
Yes, of course
United Kingdom for inventing trains
I want to thank Australia, for being so pacient when people gets their name wrong and for the beautiful city of Vienna
Thank you France, our first constitution, that we're very proud of, was directly inspired by yours
I also think spanish cuisine has also benefited quite a lot from french Fame and culinary institutions (though It did have it's share of downsides)
Thank you England, though admitedly we may HATE It, you feed our tourism and therefore a Big chunk of our economy (just try NOT to be so disruptive pleaaase)
And thank you for all going to the same Monster resorts leaving some nice places behind
Thank you Portugal and Italy for defending our interests in the EU
We're much stronger together
Thank you France for your colaboration against ETA, a dark, confusing and frankly frightening period of our history
Thank you romania for all the people Who came here, i grew up eating sarmale
You're hardworking, upright  and amazing people
Thank you Portugal for being our brother
We might not always have gotten along but now we're there for each other in deer times, we absolutely LOVE you, though we won't show It
Thanks (West) Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Italy for creating the European union
Thanks to the UK and France for being such good frenemies
Thank you Finland for Linux
I'm not sure GNU would have been able to success without it
Germany and France for keeping Spain’s economy alive and going even with how awful our politicians are and how badly they manage this money
Germany and also France for leading the EU
Without them all us whiners would have taken down the whole thing
Thank you argentina for the wheat and thxs Mexico for being the only country with russia supporting a democratic government in the civil war
Thank you France for the revolution, the civil code and the metric system
And balconing
And helping us getting rid of Napoleon
Even tough they sacked the liberated cities worse than the French
>Italy and Spain for welcoming our immigrants in their countries and provide a home to millions of us looking for a better life
thank you for your sarmale and chiftele
I work in the UK and a few years ago went on a “company trip” to Spain
It was pretty much a lads holidays, but I got to see it from the other side
Bizarre to say the least
Only thank you to Spain and is "for being basically alright for the last 50 years". LMAO
I support Atlético de Madrid
Wow
Nice answer
We love you, Portugal
We should be closer to you and make Iberia great again
Sorry about Olivenza
Actually not
I understand much better French and specially Portuguese than Italian
I mean, I can get some words and sentence structure is pretty simmilar but a lot of things and nuances will be lost in translation I guess
I'd say the same about portuguese
&#x200B;
Here, a table about how similar romance language are between them
I understand written French/Italian/Portuguese pretty decently (I can't speak any of them, I only took some French in high school but that was already 8 years ago)
As for understanding then when spoken, it depends, Portuguese and Italian are doable, especially if spoken slowly, but French is more difficult
As for Romanian, I really can't understand a word
It doesn't even sound like a Romance language to me (no offense intended
Italians and spanish can get the most of casual conversation
Italy/Spain : no
Only a few loose words
NL/Afrikaans: kinda but very hard
Many difficult words are the same, but easy words/frases are completely different
NL/Germany: similar to NL/Afrikaans
I understand maybe 60% of written Italian and speaking slowly, clearly and with the help of the hands I can understand some spoken italian
Written portuguese is easier to understand than italian, however spoken portuguese is harder to understand than spoken italian
Yes
I understand italian, it's quite similar to spanish (or reverse)
It's funny because italian it's similar to catalan sometimes, not only spanish
Personally, Italian is a language that seems like you can understand everything
There are words however that are not so similar and you can only guess the meaning of it
Basically you understand half a sentence and guess the other
As a someone who speaks valencian (catalan), French is easy to understand
Specially written
Grammar is almost identical, words are similar
Problem is, if I don't know a word in French my brain will translate it to valencian instantly, which can work sometimes
I’m Spanish and pretty much understand Italian and Portuguese
I’m also Austrian and I understand Swiss German but Dutch only when it’s written or spoken very slowly
I also speak French (grew up there) and understand Québécois, Swiss, and Belgian French
imo French is the most similar in all the different regions and German varies the most from Switzerland to Northern Germany
Portuguese is definitely easier than Italian to learn for a Spaniard (maybe not for a Catalan native though) as we share more vocabulary
However, the pronounciation is another matter
Brazilian Portuguese is more understandable as they don't "eat" vowels and they're our Achilles' heel when\* learning languages
I speak catalan thats like a blend between spanish and french and i have a really easy time undersnanding italian, so much so that i have wached movies compleatelly italian and have been able to understand them fully
And we understand you better too
I had a Brazilian colleague and we used to talk in our own language without an issue but boy was it difficult with Portuguese
It also helps that most words are similar to Catalan or Spanish
At work I've talked with some portuguese clients, never had an issue understanding each other
I think it depends on where the spanish speaker is from
I'm a native Asturian speaker and it's surprissing how many words are closer to Portuguese than Spanish, including the pronunciation
For me it is not so dificult to understand them (if they don't speak too fast
Of course the same thing could apply even more for Gallego
Spanish has  very similar phonetic to Italian, so we can understand written and spoken Italian easily
Portuguese has a very much complex phonetic and the Iberian accent is strong, so for them Spanish is easier than the other way around
Brazilian Portuguese it's easier for us
But written both languages are so similar than any of us could understand 90% of any regular text in the other language
Spanish is also close to French, but again the phonetic is very different, so written is easier to understand, but much harder than Portuguese or italian
Have you Heard danish
It's said portuguese IS as danish IS to sweedish
We can read It ok, but the pronunciation IS just so weird the language becomes gibberish to our ears
Ans That's lame because It sounds amazing just very much non spanish
Of course if you get a bit trained or the portuguese slows down suddenly everything becomes clear
It has to do with the phonetical differences
Portuguese IS pronounced very differently from spanish, you have subtle vowel differences we just (5 vowel mortals) don't get and cut half the endings of your words
When we Talk It just sounds like horribly butchered portuguese asif someone was reading letter by letter, but when you Talk It sounds like some half drunk russian tried talking to you
For any nordic speaker, i've been told portuguese IS similar to danish, the grammar and lexicon are there, but the pronunciation IS
a tad imaginative
I wouldn't say your experience is the norm
Portuguese are better understanding Spanish but I have never had any problems understanding someone from Portugal if they want to
Also French and Italian can be understood if they speak slowly and want to be understood
Sorry, i know It isn't perfect but i just wanted to give the idea of what happens when a portuguese and a spanish try to speak in their own language
I don't know that much of either sweedish or danish, i've just been told it's a similar situation
I've also been told some portuguese aspects are shared such as the tendency to drop the endings of words
However it's definetely outside my expertise and even my competence level
Again, just wanted to give a general idea
There's also some more detail in our case
Gallician IS much Closer to portuguese so gallician speakers can understand portuguese even better
I know brazilian dialect is quite distinct and i'm not that sure how a portuguese would understand a murcian, a gaditano or a canarian as their accents are quite marked
In Spanish news currently I would say it's daily
Quite irritating to be honest
In catalan news I would say it's a bit less often since it's more regional focused and we have our own priorities like talking about a possible independence 24/7
Spain: it's constant, smth between hourly and weekly
And it's pretty infuriating, so many things we don't know about and we "HAVE" to know what trump last fuck up was
Everytime that Trump says some stupid shit
So everyday
well, it depends of a lot of things
Who is in the office and main things or statements (with trump is very easy you know ahahaha)
ongoing wars
riots
GDP
Sometimes they can be talking about the USA several times a day and sometimes 0 during some days in a row or not make it to the front page or headlines
usually how your country is portrayed rely directly in what we think about the thing the media is talking about more than in the way the media tells the news
and what about us in your news
What pisses me off is that we're on the verge of an armed conflict in the Mediterranean and virtually no one is talking about it because Trump saying some stupid shit, like he does literally every day, is apparently more important
I haven't heard about the escalation of tension between France, Greece and Turkey in television and big newspapers are mostly ignoring it too
One day we'll wake up to the sound of nukes and we won't know why
Read again
>because Trump saying some stupid shit, like he does literally every day, is apparently more important
You can't read or what
The last shenanigan was deflecting concern about climate change by blaming the fires on negligence by the Democrats
But we've been having way dumber things
Like the whole "injecting bleach" and UV light thing, the antifa "terrorists", Covid being a Chinese plot, etc
Literally no one here gives a shit, but the media keeps bringing us these irrelevant stories that do nothing but alienate us from what actually matters: that a hostile power is threatening peace in Europe once again, but this time everyone has nuclear missiles
Yes, since I did my exchange in Seoul, I could really saw how Europeans have way more in common that I thought before
How I could easily relate to any of the other Europeans but there was never any chemistry with the Americans/Asians since the cultural differences were too obvious
There were not many exchange students but we were a close core of Europeans with Spaniards, Italian, French, Finnish, Germans, Dutch, Romanian, Austrians
and we still remain close friends years ago
Some time ago I was lying in bed, thinking on what being "European" means
After thinking about it for several hours I came to realize one thing
European countries, for the throughout all their history have been fighting eachother nonstop, even tough most of the time they were fighting and dying for basically nothing
But, since the EU was created, those countries that literally were fighting eachoter some years ago are now
Working together
Protecting eachother, growing together
That was the moment I realised the importance of the EU, being european, and the european identity
As a Spaniard that has grown up in a capital city, studied abroad in a different European country (Belgium), and has spent the last decade in a third European country (the UK) I can't help but feel that there's more that unites us than that divides us
I've felt comfortable and at home in all three countries
Our differences, while obvious, are not deep enough for me to feel our societies are significantly different in respect to what matters most
Spending some time in the US was eye-opening
I felt that, while it was easy to get along with Americans, their core values and the way they see the world is worlds apart from us, and to me this highlighted the similarities among European nations in a way that I hadn't really thought about before
In Europe I feel Spanish
Outside of Europe, I feel Spanish AND European
Maybe the key of being European, what defines the European identity, is valuing the rich cultural diversity of our continent while understanding that we share the same core values, and working toghether to uphold those values
I must say, though, that this might not apply to all countries in Europe
I am pro-EU, but I think it needs to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century, and at the same time it needs to go back to its roots of solidarity and striving for the common good - the interests of banks can't be put ahead of the interests of the people ever again
Don't get me wrong, banks are necessary, and a healthy banking system is essential, but it has to be a banking system that works for the people too, not for itself only
Austerity was a mistake politically, socially, and most paradoxically, financially
Absolutely, I mean, of course a German and a Spaniard are different but people from the north of Spain and from the south are VERY different
I don't know if we will be a whole nation in the future but I feel proud of Europe, I like to be European and I want to be European
I pay taxes happy to help Europe and I'd pay more if needed
Spanish citizen usually look at our neighbors as a model so lot of us want to become a little more like all of you
It's important to note it seems nobody in Europe wants a war and historically it isn't so normal
I feel totally European
After reading the other comments, I realize that those who have an opinion closer to mine are the Germans, who have a territorial system similar to the Spanish and I think that allows us to better understand that multi-identity
In my day to day life, I identify myself with my hometown, even though I no longer live there, I still speak with their accent and carry out our small and particular traditions
When I am with other Andalusians, I feel identified by my province because there are many cultural and even language differences between them
And when I interact with someone from another part of Spain, I feel totally Andalusian
With each step of identity, the kinds of things that connect me to it grow
The things that make me feel European are the "big things" in life, and I don't feel less European for feeling Spanish or Andalusian, because what defines each of those identities is different, but compatible
The fucking crisis of 2008 has stopped European integration in its tracks (just look at the fact that we used to have a new treaty every few years, and now we don't)
I sincerely hope that it will be resumed sooner rather than later, because there are still many things we can improve together, without renouncing our national and regional identities
Even if we were to create a European federation we would not have to lose it, just look at the current federal states and their cultural diversity
The EU in itself is a supranational entity unlike anything that has gone before, and our future can be as well
Indeed, in [this video] you can see that through history, Europe was the battlefield of the world for around 2000 years, until EU came and stopped that
> Therefore I don't think that something like a European identity will ever come into existence instead of the more regionally shaped identities
Couldn't this be compared to the local identities vs the national one in Germany, Spain, Italy the UK
>Unless, of course, we'd have some "European nationbuilding" that aims at the abolishment of the regional identities
I think programs like Erasmus, increasing English proficiency, open borders, companies marketed at the EU specifically
can do nationbuilding without oppressing or forcing anybody
In fact, I think without migrant and financial crises that separate people, there's a strong chance a European identity would eventually form from the ground up without state intervention
> I view it the same as Indian or Chinese, they are both Asian identities
But within these countries there are dozens and dozens of ethnicities, languages and religions (less so with China since they've worked against it)
They're only an identity because people have been told so
Identities can and are often built
I don’t think so
The people I know don’t think like that at all
well all the people of south america seems familiar to me so it depends of the country
Depends on the day
Today here in London is a bit sad, mostly the weather, but I had a good jog in the park and I made friends with a puppy so I guess I am in a mild mood
Probably when I play some online game with friends after work it will improve
Thanks for thinking I’m a happy person, it is a positive view
Mozarts birth house in Salzburg, I get that you like the music, but the house itself is not that exiting
I would rather recommend to by a ticket to a concert of his work as there are many awesome musicians living in Salzburg
Also Salzburg in general is just flooded by tourists in the summer
Valencia is such a great city overshadowed by Barcelona
Most cities have everything you want when you think about making a trip in Spain, without the high prices that usually come with mass tourism
Barcelona is such a tourist trap with inflated prices
I'm not telling you not to go there, you will probably have a great time
But places like València or Zaragoza are really amazing and you won't find the same experience in a place like Barcelona
Edit: places that don't have that much to see compensate with more cultural events which usually involve nature, food, or popular events
They play with the experience of the tourist instead of relying on their tourist attractions
las fucking ramblas in Barcelona
And for that matter Barcelona in general
Lived there for a while and I must say there are soooooo many more beautiful cities in Spain
Although I guess Barcelona has a cool vibe
Pretty much every touristic destination here, because tourism itself ruined it
Also northern Spain is criminally underrated
Not implying they are bad, but overrated:
Barcelona and the rest of the Mediterranean coast (cities and beaches, Alicante, Málaga
Madrid (good, but not as outstanding as some people say, the same as Barcelona)
Balearic Islands (in terms of beaches and stuff)
Every tapas bar in the center of the spanish cities use to be a tourist trap
You have to search very good and ask locals to find hidden gems
Still lots of fun, though
Although tbh i didn't know germans liked cocaine so much
I mean, the actual point is the festival not the price of the beer
Wow, I hadn't ever heard of this
Looks like Benidorm or Lloret
I never went inside because we just stopped on the way, and when we got to the top it was closed, but the outisde + the view were very beautiful
I've heard the inside is nothing special though
While I agree with you, I don't think that Barcelona itself is  overrated, I mean it has very special stuff that you can only see there if you're into architecture
Gaudi & all the other modernist buildings are unique
Some places of bcn are tourist traps, but the rest are ok (but full of tourist anyway)
To each his own
I was born and raised in Valencia, I always found it provincial and narrow-minded
Moved to Barcelona almost two decades ago, not thinking of moving anytime soon and for sure not moving back
The cost of living in Barcelona is a pain the ass tho, especially renting a flat
Croatia is beautiful, cheap mostly chill and has pretty much nothing to complain about
I´ve been a few times in Istria and once in Zagreb and it was really great
I could only thing of the Plitvice lakes as overrates although that isn´t fair at all, they´re are super beautiful too, just way too crowded for that price
When I went to Liverpool I was amazed at having missed such a wonderful place, while having visited London several times
Totally agree, spread your tourism to smaller/less well known places, people
I will add something very specific to London: Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
Once I had relatives visiting me in London and they wanted to see it
It was a hot day in summer, it was crowded, couldn’t barely see anything, etc
It’s much worth it to go at a different time and enjoy the outside of the palace when it’s empty
I think the reason London gets so many tourists is exactly because it is not England at all
It is probably the most cultural diverse city in Europe and kind of the New York of here if you want to make a comparison
NY also tends to not be seen as the "real America" but people go to these cities because they´re so unique, massive and full of different cultures that it´s really amazing
Nahh, it's amazing
Been multiple times there, hope to visit again
Super fun and super busy
I understand anyone tired of tourism will hate it tho
I can imagine, I lived in Salzburg for some time
The tourists in the summer can be quite a lot
I don't know that one, but I am glad you had a great experience there
Barcelona is definitely not overrated, but there's much more to see apart of the main landmarks
Other places have less important stuff but they compensate with a good experience, like food, nature or some cultural/folkloric events
It's a really big problem and the police tries its best to help
They usually go incognito in public transports or in places where pickpocketing is common and try to catch them
It's not the most efficient method but some people I know got their stuff back because the police were looking around and catched a few of them
I'm studying tourism and it feels that it has much more variety in terms of things to do
It might be the same in Barcelona but its not so obvious as people tend to do the exact same stuff each time they visit it
Yeah that region is one of the hudden gems of andalucia
The white-washed villages region
Stereotypically andalusian and cheap
For a weekend is alright
specially if you go in spring and not in the summer
but idk after living there i ended up hating it hahaha
I lived in barcelona so yeah i've seen girona
Kinda charming
But not my favorite
It is nice but the thing is there's nothing important d
arround it (which is kind of what happens wuth barcelona)
I could see it as part of a road trip but a trip only to visit cartagena
I don't see it
Another place that has amazing roman architecture is Mérida, in the region of Extremadura
But it's also quite far away from any of the major tourist spots in spain
Extremadura has a lot of historic well preserved places but it's very rural
If you want your money's worth and see quite a few places without having to take a car then I'd say the best trips are:
Madrid, visit it and use it as a base to make day trips to the medieval cities of Toledo (kind of the historical and religious capital of spain), Segovia (which has a huge roya  castle and a roman aquaduct) and maybe Soria
Landing in madrid and doing the cordoba-seville-Granada trip using the high speed train (AVE)
The beach is also nearby if you want some of the famous spanish resort life
Spain is filled with them
I'd say pick a region and go there
The most popular one is the andalusian trinity: Cordoba, Seville and Granada
All of them amazingly charming and romantic
And also way cheaper than Barcelona
I like barcelona, it's a beautiful and fun city but tbh for me except for a few places looks kind of generic
I've been living in madrid (moved from barcelona)  for a while now and for me it's just more authentic
You know what I mean
i know about the mint thing
I'm reffering to the real thing
A LOT of it
I have
You brits like it a lot too
Spain, of course
In Spain it's common to just fight between ourselves, we don't need another country
But we have rivalry with France, but they ignore us just like we ignore Portugal
Historically either France or the UK
Why tf does everyone hate on France
Mayve I'm too young to understand but seriously wtf
Hello France !
What about the UK
Historically is probably the rivalry that makes more sense for Spain
Historically, yes, for some time
Nowadays most Spaniards care so little about Portugal we even forget we share a peninsula
Historical reasons, UK, Spain and France always shifting the balance of power before modern times
Plus Napoleon occupied Spain and established a client state
That rivalry and anecdotal bitterness somewhat survived
Historically it cames from Napoleon's invasion, Spaniards have been disliking France since that
(Pepe botella was our best king ever though)
Right, because you ignore us
They are too far away to have a real modern rivalry
Although some ultra nationalists hate UK and want Gibraltar back xD
Id say it's in the same level, in fact i remember talking with my dad about who did we hate more England or France, he said England i said France
Pd: Wasnt a really serious conversation don't worry
And Gibraltar, true
yes definitely France and UK
Love you Portugal
Because you're better at everything
But I love France, in fact, I study at a Lyçée in Spain (it's a french program to study everything in french following the same curriculum but not in France)
I can only say good things about our relationship with those countries
Actually Spain is the main defender of Human Rights in Venezuela and it's an actual debate here, it seems we care more about Cuba or Venezuela than Spain
Yeah, but don't take it as hate, it's just in our blood, we need to have something or someone to blame when something goes wrong
Leftists (rojos, mugrosos) blame rightists (fachas)
Northerners blame southerners (lazy people, they only sleep and live on benefits)
Catalans (lazis) blame Spain central government (opresores, fascistas)
And when we go out, we're doing poorly because of Germany, because of the Netherlands (this one is new, it's a new hated group created a week or 10 days ago), because of the euro, because of the wars against England (piratas) or France (gabachos)
Between brackets you can see only a tiny portion of the insults we have for each group
It's like a national hobby about how  much can you twist the reality to blame others
Mmm Spain has had wars with everyone so you'll probably find some spaniard that sees Portugal as a rival
But 90% of spaniards consider Portugal and Italy as brothers
Well, it's mostly because we've been in 18 wars against you
But you have to understand that Napoleon did one of the biggest betrayals ever, like what the fuck
Spain lets Napoleon's army march through Spain to attack Portugal and when they were in Madrid they decided to attack Madrid by surprise instead
Haha that was fucked up
Football and beheading kings is not a (very) big deal
There's no real hate by the way
We like to joke about it
Now a days not evem close, never heard of anyone hating on portuguese, on frenchs, or british, yes tons of times, portuguese, never, even historically we may have fougth each other from time to time, but i don't think we have ever considered each other rivals or enemies just sometimes circustances led us to figth between us
Well at least from my point of view, i ve always considered portuguese our brothers and i really love your country
There's a felling of brotherhood but also a feeling of superiority in some Spaniards and of nationalist reaction against that in some Portuguese
I've encountered both and both are extremely annoying
We have the same thing in Spain
France is like the cousin who is doing better than you and everybody in the family congratulates him and you deep down hate that
Another reason might be the 30 wars we have had against them in the last 500 years
Nope, I think this is the time where most Spaniards know better and enjoy Portugal
We don't give you that much attention cause you are not really the source of our troubles
And I agree, our rival is always something, somewhere or someone in Spain
>From what I understood it may have indirectly led to the Franco period
Not really
But one of the resons why Spaniards used to hate France and the allies is because they didn't help out during our civil war, so the Republican Army had to accept Soviet aid (in exchange for every single gram of gold located in Spain) in order not to get bukakked by the Francoist forces, the Italian Army and the Wehrmacht (which eventually, of course, it did, lealding to the Francoist dictatorship)
The remnants of the Republican Army then liberated Paris from the Nazis in WW2 and they thought that doing that would gave them the support they needed to push the Allies to overthrow Franco but nope, their names were erased from history
That's why the left hates France
The right does because of what you said, Napoleon and stuff (which is pretty ironic because our current royal family came from France)
Nowadays you may not realise it but your president angers foreign countries way too often
There's not much you can do about it for now tho
His last adventure was stealing a cargo of around 4 million masks that Spain and Italy bought from a Swiss company and happened to be passing through France
He agreed to return half of them, but that's obviously not enough to stop both Italy and Spain from losing their shit over it
Are we late to join the club
Sorry for that, Habsburgs were dickheads
Honestly, i can understand portuguese being untrustful on our country but i still really love Portugal, stay strong during this hard times
That last paragraph hit home
Right now the Socialist Party and a left-wing coalition are in office, and the opposition (Popular Party) is constantly criticizing them and acting as if they hadn't cut healthcare spending by 15-21 billion
With all this coronavirus crisis and how Portugal and portuguese politicoans are dealing with this you are making us impressed and the way we see you is improving a lot
I was in fact thinking of what happened with the opposition on Portugal, that's unthinkable in Spain our politicians are acting like monkeys figthing and throwing shit between them, some of them look like they are trying to make electoral propaganda out of people dying
why would i pass out in the shower if i can pass out in my bed
First time I hear this for showers
You guys drink too much xD
Every damn week
Wtf
How is it better than passing out on a bed
hahah
There actually is an asteroid whose orbit is crossing ours
But they said it'd just explode at the atmosphere
Sweet
London is a good location but its extremelly overpriced, you could see many other places of britain for the same price
Barcelona is also overpriced and overcrowded with tourists, just like costa del sol, valencia
i know those tourists just want beach and sun but you can go to cheaper places for that
Agree with everything you said
Basically all the fly -> shop -> Instagram -> 100% not fake authentic cultural immersion -> take 1 million pictures of tourist infested trap -> fly back and tell everybody
(In my opinion) this kind of tourism doesn't generate any wealth except for big business, promotes gentrification in its worst expression and drives rent above the clouds, ruins local life, spoils historical sites and is also unsustainable for the environment and smaller scale proximity economy
I think the same goes for most cruises and such
I mean, I see nothing wrong with wanting to go to the beach or anything, it's not what you visit, it's how you do it
I think that money isn't the answer here, you can travel cheap and not do those things at all
(As someone from Spain that has lived in Valencia I'm biased)
Tbh, Ibiza, Mallorca and Thailand are more than just party
Of course a lot of people go for party+beach but they also have some beautiful nature which are amazing tourist attractions, mostly visited by other type of tourists different from the party goers
Obviously Benidorm, I've only been there once even though I live nearby
Pretty rubishy and overcrouded
Barcelona is trash, Spain's strenght isn't it's cities but it's small lovely towns in the mountains or on the cost (Or both)
To be fair, there are only a few "modern" cities in Europe, that's something you find in the "new" world or emerging Asian countries
The only modern cities in Europe are those that were destroyed after WW2 or poor ones that boomed these past decades
My point is, they're not typically touristy to begin with
While I half-agree with you, Dubai also have the old town, with old buildings, that part was more interesting
But well, I only was there for one day, so I don't really had time to get bored of the artificial city
Mallorca is literally the best tourist destination you could want
It has everything; old rural towns, beautify mountains right by the sea, small recluded beaches, amazing natural sites,the old city underbelly, one of the oldest cathedrals in the world, I don’t really know how to say it but it’s just amazing in every regard; you should come visit, and even if you don’t like only partying you can do that too in q couple of concrete sites
Thailand is really cool, it has a lot more to offer apart from the party/beaches, personally I prefer Vietnam or even Campodia, but as a first experience traveling a sout-east Asian country on your own, thailand is really good
That's just not true at all
Biggest tourist group in Thailand are Chinese and people from the surrounding countries and they don't go there because of the beaches and party
You just put your own perspective and opinion (which is completely fine) but assumed that's reality
Of course there are places like Ko Samui which are beach paradise but there's a lot of cultural tourism in Thailand as well
concrete = cemento
This is a "[rape] you can eat it (the pronunciation is not the same as in English)
Molestar = to annoy, bother
To molest = well, not a nice thing
English - Spanish /
Carpet - Carpeta /
Rope - Ropa /
Billion - Billón /
Sane - Sano
French: sentir (to feel or to smell)
Catalan: sentir (to feel or to hear)
French: entendre (to hear)
Catalan: entendre (to understand)
Sensitive - Sensible
Sensible - Sensato
Left is English, Right Spanish
"Travesti" (almost spelled the same as "travesty") in Spanish means "transvestite". I'll save you some embarrassing anecdotes
I had somewhere a nice list of false friends between spanish and lithuanian, because they're not the typical languages you compare
I remember 2 right now
Bamba:
LT: belly button / ES: a kind of dance, slang for sportshoes
Aire:
ES: Air / LT: Irish woman
Polish-Spanish: Kurwa(b*tch)/curva (curve) and droga(road)/droga(drugs)
Spanish, Catalonian, Italian and Portuguese are very similar, so the list of "false friends" is huge (there must be hundreds)
Just some examples with Spanish and Italian:
| Spanish  | Meaning  | Italian  | Meaning  |
| salir | to go out  | salire  | to go up  |
|  subir | to go up  | subire  | to suffer  |
| sentir |  to feel | sentire  | to hear  |
| nudo  | knot  | nudo  | naked  |
We have [cajones] in Spanish and [whatever the fuck] Americans use cajones for
>droga
[Droga] means drug in Spanish
the english pedestrian and spanish pederasta are also one of the bad false friends
Rape in Spanish means monkfish
I dont think pastel is a word in english, cake maybe
I see, TIL
Thanks for the correction
I was primarily taught the "hearing" meaning
Havent seen that thing in my Life, u mean the color
Honestly, I love living in here and I've been living abroad and travelled all over the world
I live by the see in Catalonia very close to Barcelona so I also have the mountains a couple of hours away and everything is accessible .
I live in a nice area and I run my own business so moving wouldn't be possible either
I live in one of the safest countries in the world with very advanced laws in terms of equality and human rights, I have a social health system that's works well (could be better) and the weather comparing it to the 90% of the countries is amazing
Also the people is very open minded and friendly which is always a plus
I would like to see it prospering in other ways like jobwise for everyone in here but I'm very lucky in that aspect
I noticed how much I loved my country when I moved to another, concretely Germany
I don’t live in my country but I do like to live there, what I don’t want is to work there
For a software engineer Spain is just a place where you are heavily underpaid and as any other job in Spain your manager will treat you like a slave
I was sick of that culture, and in London I’m really happy about that
About living here, depends on the day haha but average is as good as in Spain
I love living here
Good quality of life, friendly and open society and social life, good weather, great food
Ive realized over time how lucky we are
I'm not happy in my country due to the salaries
It's too hard to find a good job with great career perspectives, and I would like to live in a country which has better job perspectives than Spain
I'm looking seriously to leave the country and I don't discard to do it as soon as I can
Yes, I like living here in Spain, the balance in life is good, but on the other hand I feel the political climate here is too much for me to live peacefully so I kinda want to move to northern countries, I value stability, can't get that here easily
I mean you can love your country and still think it is not a good place to live
Happens with me and Spain, although I left a few years ago and I´m probably never coming back
I would describe it (as I often do to other people) as one of the best countries in the world to go on holidays or spend a short period of time, but one of the worst to live long time
I love living in Spain for many reasons, but there are so many problems that sometimes I just want to erase it from existence with everyone aboard
It can feel helpless (unemployment/livable wages, toxic nationalism, corruption, false kindness, and a million more)
I've been abroad before and besides healthcare, the only things I truly missed were food and variety
Variety of everything
Languages, climates, cultures, architecture
And since I kind of need to be on the road often (the thing I love the most is nature/mountain sports/traveling) it provides me with everything I need
However inside Spain I really prefer the north to the south
I like the south, it's great, but the culture feels different to mine
Then , if employers keep smashing me as always and I find a good job elsewhere  I wouldn't hesitate to move again and come on holiday, because being able to rent a house without going broke is more important than nice beaches
The only country I think I would enjoy as much is France
Based on experience, they are closer to us than many think
I consider Italy to be a slightly more catholic and industrialised and less "balkanised" version of Spain with very similar problems and upsides
I would love to try out living in a microstate like singapore, liechestein, andorra
but for normal countrys, id like west germany or United Arab Emirates
Luka Dončić
Spaniard here who fell in love with Greece when i did an internship there two years ago
I wish we could trade places
I live in Bilbao, our weather could be better but I would not imagine living anywhere else
Would love to visit a lot of places, but in the end home is home
And the food
Not to say the food is bad in other places, but I can't live without my pintxos
I can't speak about The Netherlands, but as a Spaniard I lived in Germany for a couple of years and I was shocked with the conservative atmosphere
Public schools with religious names and teaching religion, lots of young people who were religious and felt kind of insulted when talking about being gay or lesbian
I was very surprised too because the Germans that I met generally thought that we Spaniards were more conservative than they are
I think that jere we've got the same feeling as you
We also get things later than the rest of Europe
It's always been like this, for centuries
I think that I agree with every pro and con that you mentioned
I would add that it also feels nice knowing that this is our corner of the world, it's pointing towards the Americas, but it's also attached to continental Europe, so even if we're alone, we're not isolated
Plus we've got each other
We're brothers
Maybe I could also say that global warming scares me quite a lot because some of out regions are already a bit arid, so the idea that we could go full desertic is frightening
But even once again, this peninsula is amazingly diverse when it comes to climate so
We're at the limit between Europe and Africa (and even have some enclaves in Africa)
We have coastal and hot weather in the south, good for agriculture and tourism
Wet cold weather in the north, good for amazing natural reserves
(Obviously these are the extremes as we have 4 seasons everywhere, except for
) Sub tropical weather in the Canary Islands for a nice stable temperature year-round
A large mountain area (second only to Norway in Europe, in absolute terms) which makes for beautiful landscape
The main 'drawback' is being in a peninsula
We are only connected to the European continent through France
We miss out on a lot of the multi-border fun "let's drive to Germany to buy gas
" because the country is quite large and it is a multi-hour drive to any border crossing
But then again, that also enabled us to avoid WWI and WWII destructions, and it depends on where you are personally
If you live in Tarifa, you are a 1h ferry away from Tangier, Morocco
If you live in Donosti, you're less than an hour away from Bayonne, France
In terms of international commerce, we are well positioned, with a lot of coast (being in a peninsula becomes a positive) and with ~~shared~~ jurisdiction over an important maritime spot (Strait of Gibraltar)
Overall, I like the latitude, the variety, being so close to Africa, having our own little Hawaii and being part of the Mediterranean Europe gang with Portugal, Italy and Greece
Non, France, tu n'est pas invitée.
I like spain's location (mediterranean + atlantic sea)
I like the peninsula i like the variety of climates (a bit of everything gives also a lot of variety to our cuisine and also allows many different cultures inside our country)
And idk, historycally speaking it has been mostly peaceful and stable borders (the oldest border in the world is between spain and andorra), the pyrenees are a great barrier
The european great plain always looked unprotected to me
I just love the variety in everything that spain provides
The perfect location
Borders are well defined and protected by natural barriers such as rivers and mountains
Major ports close to other Mediterranean countries like Italy or the North of Africa
Warm weather but with some rainy seasons
Isolated enough to be easy to defend
Some disadvantages though
A great country in the North which used to be far more developed than us and eventually just squashed us instantly
The borders are not close to the populated areas which made it difficult for new ideas to arrive in the country (only a few exceptions)
The entire country is elevated from the sea level and decreases the closer you go to the coasts and any transport infrastructure is more expensive to build than in a flat country
And the seasons can be brutal
A very sunny place can suddenly have a rainy season and all the rain that never fell in a year drops in a few days flooding everything
From Graz to Trieste there are 3 hours by car
That's just half an hour more than from my city to the sea
From Madrid it's 4 hours
For many people in countries with a coastline, going to the beach it's always a vacation
Well, I am from a country know by its beaches and the nearest one I have is about 4 hours by car
At least in Austria you have more rivers, lakes and mountain
Here, in the middle of nowhere, we don't have that, only 40 degrees in summer :)
Although if it wasn't for the internal political issues that weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, you could've benefitted from that plain at the expense of Russia instead of the opposite
From diversity comes chaos, but god damn is it worth it
It's such an amazing clash of worlds
>We also get things later than the rest of Europe
It's always been like this, for centuries
There was a saying some centuries ago "Africa starts in the pirinees". This is how far behind we were
Oh wow, that's harsh
i remember my history lesson once, my teacher said that in our industrialisation, which grew much later, England would sell us their old weaving machines, and they would use the more modern machines
That and all the protectionism we had for a while, and here we are, a first world country and yet still behind others
Portugal feels more of a neighbour than France
France feels different to Spain in many ways
Yet I rarely hear from Portugal which is weird
A part of Spain feels like parts of Southern France, yes, but other parts are quite similar to Portugal
North Region feels like Galicia and Alentejo and the Algarve feel like Andalusia and Extremadura
I seriously doubt you felt isolated between 1000 and 1450 considering the heavy involvement of the English monarchs in France (who were arguably French monarchs in England)
Or when the English king was also elector of Hannover in the Holy Roman Empire
I know, but that's a technicality
Portuguese, Italian, Greek and Spanish people are all ethnically / culturally similar in a way that France isn't. At least that's how I see it
But I was trying to be funny in a "you can't sit with us" way
Other European states had been centralising power around the monarch for centuries at the expense of the nobility
In Poland-Lithuania this wasn't the case, tho
Nobles still had a huge power
The king needed their approval to pass any kind of legislation and the nobles had to elect a new king everytime the old one died
This isn't bad in principle
In fact it seems like a more fair system compared to most of Europe, right
The PLC was the country in Europe with a bigger voting franchise at the time
In fact the system was officially called "Nobles' Democracy" and a "Republic presided by the king". The citizens had a lot of freedoms compared to other countries (like England with its Carta Magna) and even the first religious freedom legislation in Europe
However, this system was extremely dysfunctional for a number of reasons
First of all, every single noble had a right of veto in the Sejm (assembly)
One single vote could stop new legislation that had been being negotiated in the entire session
That is never good for a country
Another thing was there were a lot of people who had a say because even poor low nobles who had nothing more than their title could vote
They were very easy to bribe by high nobles
And this is, after all, nobility, and their factionalism was more about selfish interests and family rivalries than some political ideology on how to rule the country
And then you have to apply all this factionalism to the election of kings
Other kingdoms like Bohemia and Hungary were als technically elective monarchies, but their nobles almost always elected the heir of the previous monarch and that's it
That's undemocratic, of course, but primogeniture successions did help to consolidate power
Even then, it could've worked if the nobles had limited to choose someone from among themselves, like in their contemporary Italian republics
However, after the Jagellonian dynasty, that formed the union, died out, they started to frequently elect foreign kings like the prince of Transylvania (Hungarian vassal), a deposed king of Sweden and his children or various electors of Saxony
That is of course not good
Having a foreign king also irreversibly tied them to the politics and conflicts of their country of origin
In the midst of a war with Russia and an armistice with Sweden, a faction of the nobles elected the king of Sweden on their own and invited him to invade the country and war against his own cousin, beginning the Deluge that caused a very long-lasting damage and destruction
In the 18th century, the Saxon kings often disrespected Polish-Lithuanian liberties and the nobles rebelled and deposed them, but then those exiled kings invaded with allies to be reinstated
This weakened the PLC a lot and opened the gates for the partitions by Russia, Prussia and Austria
So as you can see there was a lot of conflict caused by succession
You could argue that the Deluge would've never happened if it wasn't for the elective monarchy or at least for electing foreign kings
Didn't it began because the king of Sweden claimed the Polish throne at the request of a faction of the Polish nobility, while the Lithuanian nobles were trying secession and during an ongoing war with Russia
It seems to me that the Polish-Lithuanian nobility was very responsible for the downfall of their country
They're also very family oriented, anyone else is an outsider
My aunt married into a family, so if i were to go there i would be part of the family, and not be treated as an outsider
In my families town they have two prices for food and drinks at bars and restaurant, the cheap one for them, and the overpriced one for tourists
It's very traditional
It has similar climate, similar architecture, similar economic activity, similar landscape, similar pottery tradition
I like history so I listen to podcasts/documentaries while getting work done for college
I also read about it online when I'm bored
Nothing really serious, though, I don't read academic essays nor anything like that so I take everything I know about history with a grain of salt
Yeah
Like Andalusia lol
Alentejo reminds me of the inner parts of Andalusia as well as Extremadura and maybe even La Mancha
Areas with little population as well, relatively impoverished and with huge extentions of farming fields of cork oaks, olive trees or dehesas/montados for cattle
Évora reminds me a lot of Extremaduran cities like Mérida or Cáceres
I'm sorry to be the dick but it's Written Andalucía
Not in English
Oh right
Moved to the UK when I was 18 to study a degree and four years later I consider it home
I go back to Spain a couple of times a year at least, and now I’m here spending the summer
My relationship with the UK is love/hate but so it is with Spain
At the end of the day, there’s no perfect place
I’m open to the idea of moving countries again :)
Sorry if I dont fit the question perfectly but Ill tell you why since I am planning to leave spain to never come back as soon as I can (probably USA or Canada with preference for Canada)
The political system is so fucked up in Spain, every single politician has so much shit and since you can be president more than 8 years here and there is not a single president but a whole party behind him politics have become a way to make money, its all a fucking way to make money and 60% of people getting 5000€/month salary are fucking useless and could be perfectly fired
Corruption is very real here in Spain
To make an example I know a dude that its part of a very big political party here (not even close to the president, but not a nobody either) and since he entered the party he has got 3 university degrees in 5 years (usually it takes 4 years to do one)
He hasnt said anything, but I see something weird there
I am so tired of the situation and I want to fucking leave ASAP
I believe public services should be available in all the official languages
If you want to talk to your doctor, teacher or local administrations in Luxembourgish you should be able to
Interesting
What part of Spain are you in
I dont know, honestly I havent investigated much, and there are too many states
All I know is from movies or things that I see around here, like texas is more from the right wing (I think) or new york is very expensive and stuff like that
I should have to take a look at it, but it would be mainly where I could get a job as my dream job (teacher) so pretty much anywhere
Also, I forgot to mention that since there are a lot of places of work here for the goverment in spain and its very difficult to fire someone from the public administration it is full of lazy ass workers that dont do their job and get a ton of excuses from the doctors (since the doctor is also free) like "my knee hurts doctor, give me permission for not going to work" and since the doctor cant prove that your knee doesnt hurt probably he will give it
And since its public you cant get fired, in a private administration if you dont go to work half of the year with cheap excuses you get fired and end of the story
Miami sounds good, but I was thinking more about teaching physics :) I can speak spanish perfectly, I have a very good vocabulary, I am very good at redactions and make 0 mistakes while writing, and (of course) a very good accent BUT I suck at syntax, how are spanish clases there
What do you study
Because I remember when I studied german we did a very basic level with almost 0 syntax and just learning words and some common phrases (this with 15 years) so if the level is like that then sure, but if its with lots of syntax then for sure I couldnt teach that haha
There are many, but the funniest I can think of right now is "mandar un tronco al aserradero" (to send a log to the sawmill)
Other ways I've heard:
* Plantar un pino (to plant a pine tree) this one could be easily the most commonly used in a funny way
* Liberar a willy (free willy)
* Calcular tu Producto interior bruto (to calculate your interior brute product)
* Liberar rehenes (to free hostages)
* Descomer (un-eat)
* Hornear un muffin (to bake a muffin)
Voy a lanzar un misil (I'm going to throw a missile)
Poner a Obama en la Casablanca (put Obama in the Whitehouse)
Voy a quitarme un peso de encima
plant a pine tree, free willy, drop ballast,  there's so many of them
we could probably achieve a list of over +30 ways of saying it
Visitar al señor Roca (Visiting Mr
Roca) as Roca is the name of a known bathroom supplier
'Plantar un Pino' (Plant a pine tree or plant a pinecone) in Spanish
"Mandar un fax" (to send a fax)
"Tener una reunión con el concejal". Having a meeting with councillor
This comes from a very well known brand of toilets and sinks (Roca), which shares a name with Marbella's exceedingly corrupt councillor of Urban planning (Juan Antonio Roca)
PIB es "Gross Domestic Product" o "GDP" en inglés
Ir a hablar con el señor Roca (go talk with Mr
[Roca]
"Ir a calentar el trono
To warm up the throne
I also heard that when you feel that when you need to take a dump you say that Jordan is peeking out through the ring (Jordan asoma por el aro)
"Echar un tordo/ñordo" (Take out a turd/ñurd
"Sacar a Obama de la Casa-blanca" (Take Obama out the Whitehouse)
one that keeps in my mind is
"Plantar un obama en la casa blanca"
Put an obama in the white house
A ver Chicago
Gross domestic product sounds like a good way to describe it
That's because Roca is the most popular maker of toilets
Yeah
Or "el perrete asoma el hocico" (little dog shows the snout)
ok i laughted  a lot with this
You're welcome
I know there were a lot of them in my region, specially in villages and mining towns, because the roads were really bad back then and they were pretty cheap and reliable offroaders
Here in Spain I think only the Lada Niva has had a bit of popularity, mainly on rural zones
The good ol’ Niva, that would be
My experince was discovering I wasn't supposed to express any kind of emotion on Denmark's public transport system
I swear, I was just talking with my friend and her danish girlfriend and I assume at some point we went full spaniard speaking but we tried not being too loud
I felt like if I had just pooped on the queens crown, so many hostile looks XD
But maybe the best example i wittnessed was this one:
An american friend's friend came to visit
Imagine the most stereotypical dude/bro frat guy ever: handsome, built, tall, freindly and overall very nice
We showed him the city and he loved the food
Everything was great
We decided to show him how Spain parties
The  **"that's not how we do things here"** moment began here
He started (as most foreigners not used to how much alcohol bartenders pour on drinks and how spanish party works ) drinking too much and too quickly and decided he wanted a girl
He started just being a bit too handsy and grinding against some girls
I've been to the US so I know that's how party-flirting works but arround here that is a huge no-no, girls will easily slap you, hard
And also it's considered creepy as fuck
We came to teh rescue and explained it to him
he's a nice dude so he apologized to the girls, it was tense though
seeing guiris getting really drunk at 11pm saturday night WFT
there are 8 hours ahead of us mate
Living in the US and having Brazilian friends you will get invited to cookouts and stuff
well imagine the surprise of me being the only person eating pizza with my hands
You could see the confusion in the eyes of each of all the brazilian families, and me being spanish, not understanding
and honestly 9:30 is being conservative
many times people have dinner at 10
This represents so much, lol
Are you kidding me
Thats insultingly early
21:30 is even a bit early
22:00-22:30 is common, and sometimes I go out for dinner at 23:30
Interesting
I'd say nowadays most people wear seatbelts in Spain (everyone I know does), but maybe it's because most people I know are my age and we have been taught to wear them
Personally I feel really uncomfortable when I'm not wearing it
everyone complains about how noisy we are but I'm currently sitting in a bus in Malaga right now and there's a group of Swedes basically shouting, if they don't stfu imma go yell helvete va jobbigt
In Spain it's common for the waiter to come the table to take your order, even in pubs
That sounds weird to me too as a Spaniard
See
In Spain would be like in Ireland
Go for rounds
Well well well, how the turntables
21:30 is spot on dinner time for me
22:00 is a bit late for my taste
However my lunches are usually way past 15:00, sometimes close to 16:00
I guess I have an even weirder meal schedule
21:30 I think it's the average time
22:00 is common for going out to eat tapas, and 23:30 while it isn't uncommon, it's late
Another thing would be to go out at 21:30 and ending your dinner still in the bar at 23:30
bruh when my friends and I meet for dinner we usually meet at 20
30 and i always thought it was a bit early but still not uncommon
You are not being rude
we are super noisy
If you ever travel to Madrid or Barcelona (or Spain in general), PLEASE enter a bar at like 23:00
you'll understand why we do that ahahaha
It's funny
On the one side I find people being extremely loud in public places (typically public transportation, restaurants, bars
) annoying, obviously
On the other hand, when I've travelled to other places in Europe, the extreme silence in these same places creep the fuck out of me
If I had to choose, I'd stick to the loudness, just because I'm used to it
But ideally it should be somewhere in the middle so at least it feels like you're not surrounded by dead people but not wild animals either
We Spanish really are loud
Personally I try to adapt to where I am, if people are loud then I'm loud if they're quiet I try not to make noise
And when I travel abroad and hear someone in public transport being loud, half of the times they're Spanish
It's a bit embarassing
That's not normal
At least in all the companies in which I've worked
It's normal to lunch for more time but not when you have a meeting after lunch just because the old style management appreciates people working long hours and it's simply impossible to keep focused for that amount of time so it becomes an incredible waste of time to do the same work
That's just how we do things: normally lunch is served at 13:30
14:00 and dinner at 21:30 on weekends and vacation lunch is at 15:00 and dinner at 22:00
in between we have a snack (called merienda but that's it)
It may be becasue we are a lot more outdoorsy
I've heard that it started because 14:00 is the hottest part of the day, so having lunch and siesta from 14:00 until around 16:00 kept workers out of the worst heat
There's my bro
I knew you wouldn't betray me
23:00-24:00
And yeah, it's kinda late
Don't ger me wrong, our schedule is more fun, Specially in the summer, but it is a bit fucked up
That's when I eat lunch in Spain
I tip for a good service, otherwise I don't. That's how it should be imo
Last time I went to Germany, I remember at least two places where there was a "tips are not included" in our receipt, which I found weird as while tipping is relatively common in Spain, I don't ever remember seeing one of those
I guess it is even more common there
How many people would you say don't tip
I think the same
I had to take the train weekly for some time
Some days the train was dead silent, other days it was dead silent but with two people loudly speaking so everyone in the train can hear all the conversation
And other days, when the train was packed, some people start to speak loudly and of course the rest have to do the same to be heard, and in the end it becomes hell on earth and it's a loudness competition
A middle ground where everyone speaks freely but without shouting would be perfect
But nobody is aware of this
Same here, in fact when I travelled to Vienna with my family my father was extremely pleased with how quiet everything was (he is quite the introvert so quietness and calmness really suits him), and my sister would start shouting everytime she opened her mouth
Everytime my father would have to remind her to lower her voice
Force of habit, I guess
I do enjoy not having to shout when I'm in a bar or a restaurant in other countries
Hey, I am from Spain, I agree with you, and I would think most people here would as well
I mean, this is not a situation where you have met to have a couple of drinks and you can arrive later or ask where they are, these are people waiting for you so you can move in and tell you how everything works and so on
In fact, one of my flatmates moved out and she did the same thing you just said, and me and her other flatmates thought it was very rude or
lazy on her part
Something like that
She is incredibly impunctual/unorganised by any kind of standard, though, so even though I like her a lot as a person I did expect something like that happening
So don't think what you saw would be that common in Spain: it's true we are way more chill with punctuality and schedules, but not showing up and not even calling or something at least
That's incredibly rude
Lunch is served at 14:00-15:30 where I live
Tbh the spanish mentality tend to be like "NOISE  IS  FUN "
Probably being used to noisy environments in bars, so you have to speak louder to be heard
It's not a thing I like and I tend to be self conscious about speaking volume, specially when I'm out there
But sometimes is complicated, some of my friends can be very loud
I don't think that's the norm in Spain
There are a bit of everything, of course
From 2-12 years old they start at 9:00
From 12-18 they start school at 8:00-9:00 or so
So most kids go to sleep at 10:00-11:00 depending on the dinner time
I've always found anglo saxon people obsessed with the children's sleeping time
Literally no one but the elderly and luttle kids take naps
I wish we could
But sadly the "siesta" stereotype is false and old haha
Dinner is between 21:30 and 22:00 so sleep time for most kids is 22:30 and for teenagers 23:00-24:00
19:00 is literally homework time and videogame time
I guess we are used to it
Here only the elderly go to bed that soon
I mean i've not gone to bed that early since I was in school haha
That could be the case, but he specified that he was *moving in* that day, so they will certainly at least have to wait for you because you have no way of entering the apartment, and they have to hand over your keys
I think not even at least calling them is a complete lack of social awareness, no matter the country you come from
Yup
We tend to use "Anglosaxon" as a shorthand for English-speaking people
True, should have added that it is mainly directed to English-speaking white people, with the exception of the Irish (never heard of anyone refering to them as such)
Dude, I'm talking about the use we Spaniards give to it, not the medieval Germanic people
It's like how sometimes "Latinos" is used to refer to Hispanoamerican and Lusoamerican peoples
The *fabulas* from Samaniego, tales about wolves and shepherds in general, traditional fairytales (fairies, monsters, etc
Most of them wouldn't adapt well to what kids are supposed to read now
Kids used to read internationally famous (dark) stories too: Esopo, Perrault, Andersen
Enriqueta Martí or 'La vampira del Raval' was a woman living in the 19th century Barcelona
She used to kidnap kids by offering them sweets, and once they were in her hands, she used to decide whether that kid was sold as an adoptive kid for a new family or the kid was murdered to sell its organs for magical treatments
She also used to conserve this kids organs in jars inside her house
Luckily she was finally captured and imprisoned
I mean Sánchez could put up a bit of a fight but he'd probably fail tbh
Our king is a young, tall dude
The Queen wouldn't stand a chance
Went to visit a friend in finland and we did with his friends the whole sauna + frozen lake thing in one of the friend's countryside house
They all found very funny that I didn't know we were supposed to just "chill" naked in the sauna
They were all "why did yiu bring a swimsuit
Idk it was weird for me to be naked arround strangers hahaha
I remember my first time in the UK
My pronountiation was bad so  every time I tried to say "cheers" as thank you, I said "cheese" and everyone laughed
hahahaha
At first I didn't want to take them out either but all the finnish guys were like "come on pussy, or we'll believe all spaniards are small down there" and I was like "Ok, you little shits
Now, this is enough
for my country's honor".
Tbh being naked arroun other dudes does create a bond
Tbh being naked with yoyr friends does create a bond hahaha
It was only weird for me because I was showung my balls like 4 hour after meeting them hahaha
I never belonged to my age range nor my country/region
My mom says I never behaved like a kid of my age
In the sense I never was naughty, I never took other people stuff, I was very clean (In the sense I was always washing my hands and stuff like that) I never had a rebellious phase, I never liked the culture the other teens liked (like rap music, or dumb action movies) etc
And also I do not fit the stereotypes of my region
I never liked parties, alcohol, loud places, I'm not funny, I don't enjoy food, I'm very "cold hearted" and shy
(I always felt I fit the scandinavian stereotypes in that sense, but I'm not saying I identify myself as scandinavian)
Definitely, I'm a quiet person and huge loner who loves peace and silence, staying in at home and such, the polar opossite of this country
I haven't lived abroad so this could change, but yes, i'm a bit strange and I've often felt like i don't belong
People have even told me right away that i don't seem/act spanish
i'll probably leave after finishing college, so i'll find out
I was even a bit worried when i  entered this sub, because i wasn't sure if my comments would represent my country
Getting drunk is extremely common for teenegers, and young adults (universities and such)
We used to have mega-botellones (massive public drinking meetings)
But after 30+ years it is not so common to get completely wasted
Everyone still drink beer, wine, mixed drinks, etc
Often with food or daily
But it not common to get totally wasted at that age
I guess it's similar to the US here, it's normal for the younger folk, but not something you'd see people in their 40s do
It's viewed as something to be proud of(at least here),people can be a little mean if you tell them you don't drink alcohol
Trashy
People drink with friends to have fun
If you get too drunk it is an embarrassment
Alcohol is normalized here in Spain
Most people drink moderately, but getting drunk isn't a taboo for teenagers and younger people, since most people start drinking by the age of 13 (you need to be 18+ to buy alcohol in Spain, but I'm not sure there's a minimum age for drinking alcohol, and alcoholic drinks are easy to get in places like Chinese stores even if you're underage)
Parents don't really care as long as they aren't directly affected by its consequences, especially in smaller towns, which often celebrate festivals throughout the summer, where teenagers and adults get really drunk and nobody cares
But won't you think that even in a botellón people don't try to get wasted, but to socialize through alcohol
Still bad in a botellón you don't want to be the one that is mega drunk and annoying
Happy to hear other Americans say this
I’m from Northern California and drinking to get drunk is pretty normal
No one bats an eye
My experience is just the opposite
People drink alcohol quite often, but you'll only see drunk people in parties for youngsters during the weekend
It's quite rare to see proper adults drunk in the street, an image I've often encountered traveling through other places in Europe
That's probably the reason why tourists from all ages who come to Spain from the North of Europe and drink heavily have always been seen as outrageous and a sort of cultural shock here
Might change from one place to another,thanks for giving your view anyway
Is there any statistic out there pointing to this
Drinking is mostly a social habit in Spain, you'll very rarely see a Spaniard drinking alone
Only related piece of news I've heard about domestic consumption of alcohol here was during the confinement, when apparently beer consumption escalated at homes
Children playing in the street
In some neighbourhoods in the 70-80s  traffic was so light that you could play football in the middle of the street, stopping the game to let some car pass from time to time
The "sharpener man". He used to go to the neighborhoods in city areas on his motorcycle/bicycle and blow a whistle with a particular nice sound so people could come to sharpen their knives, scissors or any sort of blade
Dressing all in black when a relative died
Nowadays your grief goes inside and you don't have to show it to the world
The "melon man". A guy selling melons on the street with a tune saying how amazing the melons are
"¡El melonero, señora
¡Melones dulces como el caramelo
¡El mejor melón de Villaconejos
¡Ha llegado el melonero, señora
Roughly translates as "The melon man, madam
Melons as sweet as candy
The best Villaconejos (a small town known for their amazing melons) melons
The melon man has come, madam
This guy still comes around my neighborhood (in Madrid) about twice per month
The "melon man". A guy selling melons on the street with a tune saying how amazing the melons are
"¡El melonero, señora
¡Melones dulces como el caramelo
¡El mejor melón de Villaconejos
¡Ha llegado el melonero, señora
Roughly translates as "The melon man, madam
Melons as sweet as candy
The best Villaconejos (a small town known for their amazing melons) melons
The melon man has come, madam
My cat really hated that whistle
And "El Sereno", some kind of watchman who wasnt a policeman, but was around the streets at night and had the keys to the buildings
He used to "sing" the hours
"Las 5 en punto y serenooooo"...thus the name (5 a.m. and "serene")
They used to be pretty authoritarian; my mother in law had a scolding from one everytime she was coming back home at "indecent" hours
>particular nice sound
Hell no it's annoying as hell lol
Edit: Might have something to do that the ones I encountered didn't have an actual flute, they just blasted the sound on extremely crappy speakers
Spain (at least where I live) is flooded with bidets, even nowadays
I haven't ever lived in a house/apartment without one
I like how they kinda trademarked that whistle
It'd wake me up in lazy weekend mornings and it won't annoy me at all :)
Yeah
Same in mine in Barcelona, he used to come every other weekend
Now with corona not so much though
[Here] you have
People used to say that when they came, it meant it was going to rain soon
In Spain there are not public toilets, either free or paid, in most of the cities
Nope
The closest thing I've seen is a graffity that reads "read the bible". And "bible" was crossed out and said "das kapital"
North Spain here, not as religious as South, but I never seen any
Not even on churches
I remember traveling through mid East in USA and being amused by some Catholic churches holding flags neat the altar, Vatican flag and U.S. flag
I've never seen such a thing
The closest thing were my Brazilian evangelist former neighbours, who failed at street proselytism for years
Yeah, I think I've seen at least one in Spain, but it's not like people pay much attention to billboards, even less to religious messages
I live in front of a catholic [neocatechumenal] parish
In all my years never been so agressive as some of the rallies i see in some US news
Can't deny there can be some in my country, but most i've seen are some evangelical talking very loud in the public transport like
three times in a decade
Religious billboards not really
Baroque art worked wonders for the Church in the times of the Counterreform though
Also, you can see tourism ads from Spanish cities promoting their own Holy Week processions (Easter but serious, for my non-Catholic fellows)
I don't think I've ever seen one in Spain
In London, I've seen some people (who seem to have some kind of mental illness) posted outside busy tube stations shouting about Jesus
Same in Spain
There is one in Dundee that says 'Jesus is looking for sinners', I guess he is looking in the right place
I've never seen billboards in London, but I've seen people shouting "the end is nigh
" and stuff about Jesus and sinners outside tube stations in the centre (Oxford Circus for example)
There are bible passages on big billboards along various accesses to Valencia from the Barcelona highway (V21)
I've seen a few others elsewhere too, but nothing as the monstrosity OP posted, and I can't find any pictures on Google
So, there are some, but it's nothing short of a rare sight really
South Spain here, sad to hear a northern friend perpetuating stereotypes
I've never seen any either
My apologies, but, can we blame our media
Spain has this too
At least 2 public broadcasting church channels and masses on public TV
Oh yes, we can
I speak catalan and Spanish so it's really easy to read Portuguese, French and Italian
I can understand some Romanian but it's difficult, reminds me of my Latin lessons in high school
We can read Portuguese very easily, then Italian, then French
A typical Spaniard could understand an article written in Italian and Portuguese, with French usually yes but not always
Romanian cannot be understood either spoken or written
Reading: Italian and Portuguese
Listening: Brazilian Portuguese is the only one I can understand even when it's spoken at a normal speed, Italian I can understand it when spoken slowly and clearly, and Portugal portuguese is the hardest to understand
Then you have French and Romanian that are impossible to unerstand even if spoken slowly (I can understand something if read though)
I'd say Portuguese, Italian and French are pretty easy to understand when written
French is the easiest if you also speak Catalan
sad Catalan noises
[Languages of Spain]
Well, depends on your High-school "path" but if you take liberal studies it is a mandatory course, or at least it was when I was studying in the mid/late 2000
I studied it for 2 years and had to take it as one of my "selectividad" exams (University Entrance Exam) to access University
Mind you, Spain is famous for changing the Education Laws every few years (or after every election /change of party) so it may have changed after the most recent law
Haha well if you bring in Catalan then that (and Galician) is certainly the easiest one to understand
Oh well, good to know
Thanks
Actually I really liked Latin because it helps you to find the root of many words not only in Spanish but in other Latin languages
Probably the laid back culture
We will never do things exactly by the plan, we will never understand why you need to be *exactly* on time, we won't break our backs for something that's not completely worth it, we value our "chill" time much more
Also the tapas culture
The eternal two Spains: two irreconcilable sides for everything
Also bars
Figthing between us and a more paused life style ( i mean drinking a lot and sleeping siesta)
USA- Sense of independence
It took me leaving the US to realize how important being independent and self-reliant is for us
It’s reflected in where we live, how we get around, how we work, how we communicate with and judge others
and it’s a lot of the reason why our government (in my view) is so ineffective when compared to other countries
If I believe that I should provide for myself, why would I accept aid from the government
Spain- Working to live, not living to work
At least I hope it stays like this
I don't know, things can change fast in a few generations
In Spain, name days were very popular in my parents generation and before (and even when I was a kid, they were still semi popular)
But nowadays kids don't celebrate them anymore, many of them don't even know the day
I used to bake bread at home and loved it, I can't resist the curiosity
Do you have any recipe of classic German bread that you can share with us
The only one I know is pumpernickel, it is a bit of an acquired taste but I loved making and eating it
Finding the roggenschrot was quite an adventure
Your message brought back so many memories :_)
I don't agree with that except with the tapas thing, that's not going to stop, not on my watch
Honestly I don't see what I said as bad
Carpe diem my dude
Does this bread have a name
If not I'll write it down as "Cantonarita bread" hahaha
I'll try it as soon as the lockdown baking fever ends and I can find yeast and flour again in the stores
It sounds like the kind I love, wholemeal flour, raisins, sunflower seeds, 70% hydration dough
The fine and coarse salt mix is just brilliant, I can't believe I never heard it before
Thank you so much
As /u/achauv1 has said, it's only that I disagree with you
But it's only opinion
BTW I'm from the South of Spain and there are a lot of people here that like punctuality and being formal
Papa asada
Bocadillos and croquetas for sure
Tortilla de patata
Maybe patatas bravas and "bocata de calamares" if you go to Madrid
I would say roasted chestnuts
Most of our traditional dishes are too elaborate, but these are typical food of like street market, mostly in winter
[Bocadillos] probably
Sandwich with baguette-style bread, and anything goes for filling
Tortilla, grilled/fried meat, jamón/cecina/chorizo
Roast chicken
If you ever don't feel like cooking you just go to the roast chicken store and get a chicken and fries for about 8€. Feeds a whole family
What about stroopwafle
That's like the thing I most often ate in street markets there, and I still miss fresh ones like those
We call that «choripan» here
I went to Palermo when I was 10 years old and boy do I miss arancini
Torrenos are also traditionals on my provinces how do you prepare them on Portugal
I didn't knew it was eaten outside
Yeah, I guess
I saw the picture and I thought of street food
I also ate tons of frikandelen there, they were crazy cheap in spar (20 per 1'8€), and times were tough then
Im from Soria, we don't prepare them that way but ye close enough, thougth we are a little bit picky with them because outside Soria it's almost imposible to find decent torrenos, i hope portugues torrenos can make the difference
Yes its like those ones (thougth they are a good example of torrwnos out of Sorian ain't good torrenos because that looks correoso as fuck, and well im not gonna start on it or this comment will estend way too much
It is associated with being right-wing (except if the football team is playing)
Here if someone has a flag they are probably extremely right winged
Not particularly odd though some people will definitely judge you if you do
It's uncommon but I've seen a surge in the amount of flags people have due to things like the catalonia independence thing when it was starting and was much more widespread on the news
Personally its not odd for me
I've seen people that salute the flag and put the national anthem and that's definitely weird
Having or displaying the flag carries a tremendous stigma from Franco times when national symbols were abused and that tainted them to this day
We Spanish people are not good at moving on from troubled past events
Having one is acceptable for sports events
It's also common for Spanish students studying abroad to get it signed by their international friends as the end of their experience is near, as a goodbye souvenir
Displaying it has always being a big no-no and you would've been called a fascist if you did (in Spain you get called fascist if you're not left-wing, it's the "cool" thing nowadays)
However since the Catalonia stuff started a few years ago many people all over the country displayed their flags on their balconies and windows as a counter movement and a portion of them still remain today
Back then it would've been unthinkable to see random flags displayed by people
You also see them at the 20:00 applause
I never had one, but I knew people who did
Its not weird to have a flag in Canada, like it is in Spain, but it's not THAT common either
Here you would be addociated with the right wing parties
In my country it usually has conservative/fascist connotations
I think it was somewhat rare in Spain a few years ago, but recently it has become much more common as a response to Catalonian separatism
Which is kinda scary, because spanish "national pride" has certain
Connotations
Basically, 90% of the people who wear the flag as part of their clothing or hang the flag outside their window are right wing conservatives and nationalists
Which is pretty fucking worrysome, imho
Yes, because it remembers to Franco's time
But with time I suppose no
Well depends on the region
You might be seen as a fascist and in some situations you might even be attacked for displaying the spanish flag
A cyclist from southern spain was pushed off his bike catalans in the middle an amateur competition for wearing something with spanish flags for instance,
Here most people have one, if you dont have one it doesn´t really matter and its mostly used in events like football matches ,festivities or parades
Here in spain they call you a "facha" (like an extreme democrat) if you have one, nacionalism is seen very bad in spain, if you love your country, a lot of people assume you are a racist, homophobe etc
Which is really wrong
I’m socialist and I have it
I have the flag hanging on my house’s porch and I’m socialist
People need to grow up
The national symbol represents the nation, if you just allow the right wing to display it you could assume wrongly that is just a right wing thing
Also the left in Spain is socialist moderate while the right is wild and full of hatred so no wonder why the cool thing is to be leftist
People just want to live in peace (something quite opposite to what at least the leaders of the right wing say they want)
That's exactly what happens in Spain
Personally, I think it's a bad idea to tie yourself to a country you aren't in charge of
I don't feel particularly patriotic to either of my countries; they're just the places I've lived, nothing more
> I have the flag hanging on my house’s porch and I’m socialist
People need to grow up
The national symbol represents the nation, if you just allow the right wing to display it you could assume wrongly that is just a right wing thing
Desgraciadamente la realidad es que eso significa que eres "el facha del barrio".
A mí personalmente el tema me da bastante igual porque nunca he sido patriótico ni he tenido apego a símbolos nacionales
Pero tampoco me va a dar sarpullidos la bandera como a otros muchos
> Also the left in Spain is socialist moderate while the right is wild and full of hatred so no wonder why the cool thing is to be leftist
People just want to live in peace (something quite opposite to what at least the leaders of the right wing say they want)
Comentario parcial del día :) Tu PSOE está igual de lleno de locazos que la derecha, a la cabeza el inútil que tenemos de presidente del gobierno
Y si nos vamos a los extremos, de cualquier bando, ni te cuento
That was the case way before Vox even existed
In fact, one of the reasons that extreme right populist party came to be was precisely the far and moderate leftists claiming moral supremacy
Textbook example of reactonist countermovement
I live in the UK
I would say that we should keep writing in English just to make it easy for everyone (so they can know what we are discussing)
About “the neighbourhood’s fascist” I don’t care, I just like the flag, I like the dutch and german flag as well and I use to have them as well but during one storm they “flight to the moon” and I found a new spanish one at the newspapers store
About “your PSOE” it is not mine, if it would, it would be socialist
I’m socialist, PSOE is socialist in name only
Ok, I see what you mean
But I still don't see agree with your position that in Spain the left is socialist moderate and the right is wild and full of hatred
I think both sides are full of hateful, unreasonable, extremist crazies
Anyway, there's no point discussing this I guess
this one
Everyone has seen it
Not me though
Agree, I was about to post the same photo
I was thinking the same
I agree, the other one I've seen posted recently is [Marina Ginestà] by [Juan Guzmán] ([info]
i thought of this one, for a more modern take
The attempt at coup d'etat by Tejero
Strange, Never seen It
Never saw it
That's like on wvery spanish history book hahaha
Why
It's the spanish civil war
I'm actually crying
That's amazing
TIL Robert Capa was born Endre Ernő Friedmann in Budapest
The terrible quality of buildings built between 1985 and 2005
Cold in winter, hellish hot in summer, bad acoustic insulation, gotele, bad draining, humidities
Spain
Our politicians are subpar in every way, always fighting, stealing, separating and dividing us to gain more power and corruption
It's disgusting, a lot of us are sick of it and it makes me lose faith in the system
the lack of job opportunities for young people and/or recent graduates
We are living worse than our parents at the same age
Long stupid burocracy with everything related to my business but it could be for anything related to talking or dealing with the administration which makes it a struggle
Their websites are outdated, slow and not user friendly and to make them work is a continuous hassle
The process to create a business is one of the longest in Europe which discourages it and any mistake on your part (for lack of assessment most of the time) is hugely punished
im asthmathic so i agree on this one
I have lived in many cities in Europe and this happens all the time
Big companies tent to concentrate all in the same cities to have their suppliers/clients close
Don't get anxious about it, there will always be shitty appartments to share on the surroundings where you will meet wonderful people, and you will be able to move closer to the city center as soon you start earning some
Beginings are always hard but if you manage to adapt without falling into depression, when time pass and you look behind you will feel proud of yourself

Hello, brother
You can get unlimited data for a bit more than that in Spain
Same here and the disdain of some people towards students, like studying doesn't demand a serious effort unlike working in a factory or in construction
The fucking humidities never disappear
This, lot of people has lost faith in change or improve anything and with good reason
Same hahaha
gotele is like drip painting, like drops of paint thrown against the wall to hide falses, I hate it and every building has that and it's a nightmare to get it off
Yeah that's true, no job deserves to put your integrity at risk so avoiding dangerous areas should be a must
I hope you the best luck
Advices are meant to be useful, your alternative is just rant, maybe justified, but totally useless
>most people I know can't get away from renting because property prices are so high
The same problem here, I just decided to buy a cheap house because I realized that I couldn't make any savings for a good one if I continued renting
My life quality has decreased but I am saving money at a much faster pace and I know in a few years I will sell this crap and buy something better
the more similar thing that happened whats the anouncement of the death of Francisco Franco
the message
&#x200B;
edit: ok, i understand it wrong hehe sorry, the more similar would be the anouncement of the 11-M or the 11-S but as im spanish im going to choose the 11-M
Also the execution of ETA of the young PP politician that changed how Eta was view
Spain it is not affected by world wars, but
The effects of Spanish civil war is huge in our society
The country is still divided into two sides and the civil war is mentioned daily in politics
You can see the physical and human concecuences in a lot of towns
Totally agree
DO IT
One of the things I liked most was the constant feeling of "man, it did happen things here".
Sorry, no refunds
Yes, the @ (arroba)  A weight/mass unit
(also used by Portugal and some countries in South America)
&#x200B;
The wikipedia English article is not very good, [ because the arroba is not a "fixed" unit it changes its definition in every spanish region (in some places is 12,5 Kg, in others 10,4 Kg, etc
Not traditional, but in Spain we use commonly the "soccer field" unit for big area measures, specially in the media
It's a little weird, but it's a good way to mentally visualize how big some things really are
For example, if you read that 84
000 hectares of woods were burned in wildfires in 2019 you know it's a lot, but then usually the news add: "that is equivalent to almost 60
000 football fields" and then you visualize better how ridiculously big that is
in rural areas there were probably all kinds of local units of measurements
Just in Galicia we had "ferrados" for parcels, among many others
But nobody under 70 uses them lol
Spanish Media metrics:
- Area: football field
- Volume: olympic swimmung pool
- Cost: CrstianoRonaldos
One CristianoRonaldo is 96 million Euros
I'd add fanegas which is still used to mesure your land in the countryside
Funny thing, it can be used to mesure length or capacity
[fanega]
Also, *quintal* (100 kg nowadays)
Wrong, 1 quintal are 100 castillian pounds, around 46 kg
That's why I said "nowadays", because nowadays we use the metric quintal, not the old quintal
How complicated :/
There should be a list only for Italy, and another one for the rest of Europe
My pick:
Alhambra
Tour Eiffel
Coliseum
Pompeii
Neuschwanstein
Acropolis of Athens
Wieliczka salt mine
I think It would be more interesting to Talk about man made or natural
because there are many Who are ambiguous and Seven IS such a low number
I used to hate wine even though I live right next to a major wine producer area
Now I love it
I also used to hate flamenco because I fell for the stereotype there was for a long time that flamenco was tacky and dated, something either for tourists or conservative people
Other traditional genres like copla too but also a lot of mainstream pop Spanish music
I had a very edgy phase regarding music
Now I love Spanish music, both contemporary and old
The Valencian
When I was little I didn't see the sense to learn it because I practically didn't use it, I only spoke Spanish
I know how to speak it, but now I like to discover more about its vocabulary and its speech, although Valencian and Catalan are sometimes a topic of discussion
I prefer not to get involved in that subject and simply learn the way in which it is spoken in some areas of the Valencian Community, at the same time that I learn the Valencian the schools teach
for me its the not-being-on-time mentality LOL
Also  i hated all flamenco when i was younger, but now i found a few flamenco guitarists that are nice
I still dislike most flamenco tho
Theres also a huge sense of entitledment in a lot of the population here i feel
I didn't like the flamenco, but now I appreciate it
Flamenco music
I used to hate it as I saw it as a boring and quite annoying music genre
Nowadays, it’s not that I love it, but I’ve seen all that is behind: the art, the guitar playing style and its dance, its wide influence on the Spanish culture
It’s impressive that a music genre practiced by such a few amount of people has influenced a whole country and defined it internationally
PS: when something clicked in me was when I saw it live with dancers
That’s an experience to live
My polish mom forced me to skip the not-being-on-time mentality, now I always arrive to places 5 minutes earlier and wait half an hour for the rest to come
Probably the British chain Leon
It's varied and the food was better than expected
Madrid reporting: they're too expensive lol
They're nice but you can get a better presentation for the same price
Burgers, wraps, chicken and rice dishes, chicken wings
Seems like they've changed the menu since the time I went (the only one in Spain if remains, Gran Canaria airport)
I have heard gmail used, but i don't personally use it
Here we had a lot of local email providers before gmail was popular
So we use email
We still use e-mail in conversations, because several people that use Outlook or coorporate emails, from their working company
I think it's just the use of an isolated English word in countries where that language is not native
As you wouldn't use mail for snail mail because you have your own language for that, and if e-mail became a common word even when speaking in your mother tongue, mail is a natural evolution to simplify the loan word
Yeah me neither
Some people in this post are trying to explain the term Gmail not taking over because some people use other emailing software
But I don't think that's it
At the end of the day the vast majority of the people do use Gmail
The reason, in my opinion, is that emails have been a thing for many more years than Gmail, so the concept is so built in our vocabulary that it just isn't going to be replaced by a brand just because it's popular
And yeah in Spain we mostly just say *correo* (in my experience very few people add *electrónico*) and sometimes email
Never just mail though
Feliz cake day
As a guy who usually emails, I use mail, email and correo altogether depending on who I am talking to
Mail and email for work, correo for personal stuff
France
Germany
Italy
Portugal
EDIT 2: REVISED VERSION, REVENGE OF THE LIST
France
Italy
Portugal
Morocco/Germany
Probably actually studying history would yield Portugal much higher on the list, but as we tend not to study much of what happened between Portugal and Spain, I can't say for sure
In my history classes I've learnt much more about the other four countries
Edit: this is sparking a very interesting discussion, so to have a more nuanced version of the list y'all should look at the comments
Portugal
France
A Latin American country like Mexico
Holy Roman Empire (not the unified Germany)
Morocco or the Netherlands
Portugal
France
Arab Caliphate (because of Al-Andalus and all that)
England
United States
1/Italy: especially the Roman empire, but the Italian wars also feature a lot
Half of Italy was under Spanish control for a extended period of time
then you have royal links (like Amadeo de Saboya) and Mussolini appears in the civil war
2/Portugal: again, part of Spain at one point
But also there's a lot of common history with the reconquista and the Roman conquest
3/France: we've been battling and marrying France for centuries
There's also that time they invaded us
4/UK/Cuba: we have a long history with the UK too
From the early days as allies of castille to the Napoleonic wars
Cuba was one of the last colonies we lost and also one of the first we had
It was also pretty important so you'll hear about it
5/Mexico/the Benelux: it was probably the most prominent of the colonies, so I reckon it will appear from time to time
The Benelux was part of the Spanish crown for a lot of time, so expect to learn extensively about their early modern period
The Netherlands was also a bitter rival
when we weren't at war with them
Honorific mention to Morocco, which probably should be higher up the list
1-Portugal
2-France
mexico
4-Austria
5-North Africa in general
France
British Empire
New Spain territories after independence
Portugal
Italy
I'm counting history starting at the unification of Castilla and Aragón since before then it wasn't yet Spain
Otherwise I would've put Rome and Carthage on the list
I'm surprised to be the second, as far as I've studied this year (which is 1874, we have to learn the whole history of Spain from paleolithic to Pedro Sánchez) the only interactions I can remember are the hispania period (~200bc-~700ac) and the short period were Amadeo of Saboya ruled (1871-1873) but nothing else, what am I missing
IMO or should be something like this:
Portugal
France
Italy
Morocco
I think Germany's influence wasn't as lasting as the others mentioned above
Not a single Latin American country
If you refer from actual relevance in our history i would say
1-Austria
2-France
Otomans
4-North africa
5-Portugal
IIRC "arigato" is a Japanese word that comes from "obrigado". So there were  relations with Japan
Edit: I stand corrected, it seems it's just not true at all
Thank you for the correction
I think Austria would be a better fit that Germany tbh
We are talking about which other 5 countries would they learn the most
It would depend on where do we draw the line that defines "Spain". I took it to the broadest sense, which would mean about 300 years of shared history with most Latin American countries, since 1500 until most of them achieved independence around the 1800, but way more with other European countries If we are talking about right after the fall of the Roman Empire, where we tend to start when talking about "History of Spain" in highschool, it would mean 1500 years of shared history
Moreover, most Latin American countries have a lot of history before the Spanish conquest that people would know nothing about were they to learn about our history alone, they probably would learn more about other European powers, don't you think
It sucks but our school curriculum kinda stops at "Columbus <<discovered>> America" and never goes beyond that until the XIX century and the loss of the colonies
So not really
I'm not a historian but I think knowing more about our history would catapult all our colonies, Portugal and Italy to the top spots
The Netherlands, but especially Belgium might climb a lot aswell
That's what I'm saying, that if I knew more about my actual country's history, probably Portugal would be higher up on the list, but the image I have of my country's history ends up with that list
There are probably more historical links that I don't know of with Portugal, but I can't say for sure because my knowledge there is pretty limited because of what I was taught in school, so I can't make the list based upon those presuppositions
Yes, but we can only say 5
The countries that I said had a lot of importance for Spain
Being participants of important moments with huge repercussions in the history of Spain
Now I remember, but the only mention about it in my book was just that there was a conflict with france over the duchy of Milan, didn't know it was this big, thanks
Definitely but I still would put it in 6th place though
I think that when you study Spanish history you learn a lot about the Aztecs and the Incas as most foreign sources of information about these civilizations come from Spanish explorers and missionaries
You learn about Colombus, Cortés and Pizarro that are three of the most important figures of American History
If you study deeper you basically study the origin of Latin America up to the war of independence
If you take Germany for instance, you will only learn something about how king Charles the first of Spain was also Charles the fifth of Germany, and how he let the empire to his brother Ferdinand while giving Spain to his son
You won't heard much more about Germany until the thirty years war and then how Hitler helped Franco win the civil war
Those are just small parts of the German history, nothing if you compare it with how much you learn about Mexico, from the Aztecs up to the independence
Yeah, Morocco should be higher
I partly disagree
The fact that most sources of information come from Spanish sources does not mean that actually studying Spanish history would mean you learn more about it
Again, maybe if I were a historian I would disagree, but what we learn about our own history is certainly more about Europe than about Latin America
The fact that the part of history in which we come into the picture is very important doesn't mean that is bigger than other parts of other countries' history
It's true that probably Germany should be a bit more down the list though
How odd, in Madrid we devoted a lot of time to studying WWII
The syllabus is slightly different from region to region, though, isn't it
Yes, and report youtubers who advertise them
Not to mention that we know gambling addiction is a thing
Even if the kid does not have access to a payment method at the moment, it is probably something we don't want to have unregulated
And although I'm not in the business to ban things for adults, I would like for it to have mechanism to help adults that request it
An example would be the ability for an adult to opt-out of all digitally based gambling system
They can opt-in if they want, but with a 24h delay
My dumbass read Eurovision and I was confused with the comments of the post
Me too
I don't know, I wish that would happen, but my country has gone through this situation several times in our history and they just expanded the cities
Our rural areas are in a pretty bad situation right now, with lots of problems regarding access to healthcare, public transportation, phone signal, banks
Climate change will be a nightmare for all of us
Most of Spain already has problems with droughts in summer, for example, and they will get worse
The weather will also become way harder to predict for everyone and European agriculture in general will face new challenges
We'll probably lose a lot of our biodiversity too, although we don't really have that much left to begin with
r/Yurop together strong
You may not need access to your bank, but all the old people that barely know how to use a smartphone definitely do
Most of them can't drive because they're too old, so they have a hard time trying to get money from their accounts
I guess that will change in the future, when credit cards and phones become the usual method of payment, but right now this is a problem
If we remain disorganized and separated the global superpowers will devour us
China is already buying the black sea and the other poor countries of the mediterranean
me too, if im in algeria I will identify as european, if im in europe I will identify as north african and if im in the USA i will identify as a mexican
I feel like a similar thing happens in Spain
A lot of people see patriotism as a negative thing here and associate it with fascism, which leads people to feel more comfortable with being part of Europe as a whole
The only one I can think of is one where a low poly T-rex is dancing in a white background while a text to speech voice says "Help me I'm fainting, shut up you lesbian old man"
I don't know if it counts, but pokemon memes r a big thing here
They make me believe in my country again
In Spain we have our own reddit (forocoches) and yes, and a shit ton of them
This format with Julio Iglesias
It refers to Julio’s reputation of sleeping with thousand of women and getting their pregnant just by looking at them
Here in Spain left wing people use a picture that shows the [car ] of Carrero Blanco successor of Franco being blowing up by ETA
Also the ones about Españita
Also the ones with Rajoy running
La verdad es difícil que hayan memes únicamente españoles (no sobre el propio país) porque la mayoría son o ampliamente usados en Hispanoamérica o directamente de origen hispanoamericano (mucho texto, lo sé)
Can't believe you've just compared Reddit to Forocoches
Reddit's equivalent has been Menéame for years, Forocoches is like the gates of hell are open now
My understanding is it's more like 4chan: unmoderated, lots of reactionary content, etc
Do you know, did it start as just a forum for car enthusiasts as the name implies
Esos están tan arriba que se man pasao
Yeah but I think that every country has memes about their politicians
Ya, aunque ahora que me pongo a pensar están los memes como "Murcia no existe" y los típicos de reírse de la manera e decir las cosas del resto e comunidades
We know that feeling bro
More like a brother I'd say a family, Italy
But then I remember Germany, France and Portugal (even tough we tease last two a lot, we love them)
It will be Turkey for me
There is some kind of instant connection when I meet Turkish people
I think it's because of the Mediterranean Sea maybe
I'd say Portugal is our little brother, Italy the brother about the same age and France is the oldest brother that is doing good in life and you respect and love but kind of hate that they're doing better than you at the same time
It's curious how you don't mention eastern countries
Sssssh don't say that too high or UK would be mad
We've been in the same places at the same time: reconquista, empire, dictatorships
Portugal and Spain follow the same path it seems
Still I think Portugal's best friend would be England
Well Western Europe, say hi to Spain, Portugal and Italy
Mediterranean boys
And very proud of it
Italy is def like the cool cousin you see once in a while but when you do, you can expect it´s gonna be a cool night
Would you say that Germany sees Spain as anything than those lazy southerners
I have talk (in person) with many German people, but all of them said they liked Spain one way or other
We share a lot of history and culture and we even shared -some- territory during Charles V rule
Also immigration we're having from Germany and viceversa (not to talk you've unofficially conquered at least two Balearic islands :P )
It's in Extremadura, take it hardly anyone will notice lmao
Yeah, i'd say Italy IS our cool cousin
Portugal IS our brother though
We've gone through much of the same shit together and we're Closer that we like to admit
Northerner living in Germany here, let me answer that question: *No*.
If you want all of Extremadura just give them some trainstations and roads and they'll be joining you for sure, we sadly don't take good care of the extremeños
It's funny because is true
If germans had won probably that pilot could use german for his questions, but they don't
How mutually intelligible are romance languages (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Romanian, Catalan) Let's try it posting in our own language
Spanish:
Bien, el objetivo de este hilo es ver si verdaderamente podríamos entendernos sin ningún problema entre hablantes de derivados del latín sin usar el inglés como lengua
La idea es que cada uno haga un comentario en su propio idioma y gente que hable otros idiomas conteste qué % del comentario ha logrado comprender
El primero es obviamente este comentario ¿cuánto habéis logrado comprender de lo que yo he escrito
The thing is that latin languages are a dialect continuum
They are more mutually intelligible the closer they are
Something like this:
Portuguese- -》Galician --》Spanish --》Catalan --》occitan-southern French --》northern French --》wallon
Occitan --》northern italian --》southern Italian --》Romanian
Jo diria que prou, però més en l'àmbit escrit que a l'oral, la fonètica varia molt
És clar que aquells que parlem més d'una llengua romanç tenim advantages davant dels monolingües
Amb el valencià (cat), aprendre el francès per exemple m'ha suposat un repte molt més xicotet que si haguera parlat només el castellà.
El castellà és la meua llengua materna, però sempre que he viscut en una terra on es parla una altra llengua o dialecte he tractat d'aprendre-la, perquè crec que el multilingüisme és riquesa
Me hacía ilusión participar, decirlo en castellano era hacer un poco de trampa
Yo el castellà (o espanyol) ho entenc perfectament perque viu en una regió bilingüe, ací es parla espanyol i valencià. Varis idiomes llatins els entenc relativament be per mig de la llectura, pero oralment solament en alguns casos, per eixemple: l'italià puc entendre-lo en gran part quan l'escolte, pero no sé interpretar-lo quan lligc, mentres que el portugués em costa d'escoltar, pero hi han moltes paraules molt paregudes a l'espanyol i també puc llegir-lo sense problemes
L'accent català que hi ha pel nort i en la regió oriental de parla catalana òbviament no tinc problemes per a entendre llegint, pero hi ha paraules i frases que em costen prou d'entendre per l'accent, que considere que és molt més senzill en la meua regió. De francés puc llegir un poquet perque també hi han paraules que són similars a les del vocabulari valencià.
Yo diria que el portugués és l'idioma més fàcil d'entendre per mig de llectura per a mi, mentres que l'italià és el més difícil, pero per comprensió oral el francés el considere com el més difícil, i l'italià el més fàcil
Esquecícheste do galego :(
Ahora que los del norte no nos entienden, vamos a planear la masacre, hermanos latinos
Català aquí, basicament és occità (francès antic) que va evolucionar dins d'Espanya
Gramàticament s'assembla molt al francès, i parlat s'assembla al Italià. Tot això és obviament ignorant que ja s'assembla a tots els idiomes romànics
Yo hablo francés e italiano porque es muy fácil aprender una lengua Romance si vives en otro país del sur
El único que no comprendo, sobre todo al oral, es el rumano pero creo que es por la escritura
La única palabra que no entiendo del todo es "vicinanza", creo que puede ser "vecindad" (neighborship), es así?
Y sí, el italiano y portugués escritos son muy parecidos al español, es divertido ver como 80% de las palabras vienen de la misma palabra original del latín pero han evolucionado diferentemente
Gloria al imperio Romano, (entendí bastante: 95%)
Es impresionante como puedo entender prácticamente todo aún no habiendo estudiado italiano en mi vida, y como a los italianos os pasa igual
Puedo hablar catalán, pero el catalán se parece más al francés. Es curioso como el español y el italiano se parecen tanto, y a su vez el francés se parece menos aún siendo un país que está en medio de ambos
Quizás tenga que ver el carácter histórico como por ejemplo que España e Italia en según qué territorios formaban parte de una misma corona durante bastantes siglos
Perdoa, pero non queremos bárbaros xermánicos neste noso impe- quero dicir post
El rumano es el más difícil de entender para mí, entiendo un 30%, es muy diferente del español, probablemente porque vuestro país está separado y aislado de los otros paises de habla latina, mientras los demás han estado en contacto
(Romanian is the hardest to understand for me, I understand maybe a 30%, it's very diferent from Spanish, probably because your country is separated and isolated from the other latin countries while the other languages have been in contact)
A mi el francés me parece muy críptico, ¡y eso que lo estudié en el instituto
Aún así, como son mensajes cortos, con un poco de esfuerzo yo creo que también se entiende
Sería interesante ver a alguien escribiendo en esas lenguas
Sobre el portugués es curioso que siendo yo de España me parezca más fácil de entender el portugués de Brasil que el portugués de Portugal
Tienes razón, la comprensión oral es mucho más difícil
Tal vez debiéramos fundar /r/LatinEuropa y comunicarnos de esta forma, así ¡tal vez mejoraríamos nuestra comprensión de los otros idiomas de la familia
I was just waiting for this
Tibi gratias ago
Si jo parlant català i espanyol ja tinc avantatge respecte a colcu que només parla una llengua, tu amb 3 llengües i mitja ja ho tens pràcticament fet xD
É iso sardo
Si veo que más o menos somos parte de la misma familia, que vienen del latino de los romanos
Catalán: Si veig que més o manco som part de la mateixa familia, que ve del llatí dels romans
Pero la parte entre paréntesis no la entiendo 100%
Yo no creo que una persona francesa/española/italiana va a poder entender mi lengua
(I don't think a french/spanish/italian person can understand my language)
Home, el cas del galleg i el català és diferent, però no és tan habitual que un italià o un francès estudii castellà (tampoc es no n'hi hagui cap, però jo diria que el 98% d'italians no parlen espanyol)
Entiendo todo menos "beaucoup".
Con el francés es curioso, una frase la entiendo 100% pero la siguiente no entiendo nada xD
" Je ne pensais pas que j’en comprendrais autant
Mais ça demande de la concentration, surtout les premières phrases " 100% understandable, I know every single word, the only little doubt is "surtout" but I think it means "sobre todo" = "specially""
C’est incroyable, avec un peu de travail on pourraient tous " don't understand a single word of those, only c'est = it is, travail = work
peu = foot
Definitivamente el rumano es la lengua romance más difícil
Como dices supongo que la influencia de las lenguas eslavas y turcas ha afectado mucho
También los italianos, franceses y españoles hemos tenido mucho contacto, mucho comercio y, en cambio, los rumanos estabáis más aislados
Pero aún así entiendo 70% de lo que dices :)
Esperanto has multiple words from latin languages, this interests me, if you can understand
I think that Esperanto is very easy to understand
(I cannot guess what ankau means) motivates me to learn other languages
Esperanto is only (hobia = hobby
) language
(And the last sentence is hard to understand) It's a created language that has a lot in common with the culture
If you know English+1 romance language you can try to guess the meaning of everything but it's definetively easier for me to understand Italian or Portuguese, even French than Esperanto
I'd say Esperanto is as hard to understand as Romanian, and this is if you speak English, for someone who doesn't speak English it'd be harder than Romanian
They're called romance languages but yeah, the name comes from Roma so I guess you're half right
It's sad that I studied German for 2 years in high school and I could only understand 3 words out of 4 (I didn't know what Bahnof was), while I'm able to understand 90% of italian which I've never studied
That's what pissed off kids say when they aren't invited to the cool kids' party
¡Parece un dialecto oscuro del francés!
Sí, bueno, en su caso una variante del catalán que se habla en Baleares si no me equivoco, verdad u/paniniconqueso ?
I could understand that but I don't know if that's thanks to the English knowledge or because I have an A2 certificate in Dutch
I think knowing how to read it helps a lot as that way it seems much more similar to English
Guillerme o Conquistador, heroe olvidado da latinidade
Un oscuro dialecto del francés
Significa:
Ich   verstehe   nur   banhoff
Yo    entiendo   solo  estación
Es un dicho alemán que significa “estoy confundido”.. el equivalente de “me suena a chino”
No he comprendido casi nada
No lo sé exactamente, si están escritos las dos variantes son fáciles, pero en cuanto al lenguage hablado del portugués de Brasil entiendo 80-90% y del portugués de Portugal 50%.
Creo que entiendo mejor italiano hablado que portugués de Portugal hablado
Nunca he creado una, pero creo que simplemente tienes que acceder a una que esté libre y desde ahí se puede registrar
Well maybe it ha something to do with the fact that our ancestors spoke the same language 1500 years ago :)
Ah si, teño lido sobre el
Anglonormando creo que se chama
Lol, that's a funny expression xD
Qui si parlano le lingue romane
Il inglese e il tedeco sono prohibiti

Not sure if this is the case elsewhere but in Spain the guests are expected to give money to the married couple as a gift, this called “el cubierto
” Depending on who you invite you can end up making a tidy profit from having a wedding
> Also, at every wedding I've been to people danced the conga line
Can't explain why, but that also happens here
In many weddings, after the main dishes and before the dessert, the female friends of the bride take the groom to the bathroom steal his shorts cutting them in pieces
The male friends of the groom do the same with the garter of the bride (the groom is the one to steal it getting under her skirt)
The pieces of both clothes are sold to the guests, putting the money inside an empty bottle
The profits go to the married couple
It might be dirty in the case of the groom shorts, but I think currently they get new shorts for this thing to happen
It does seem a little bit crass, I admit
But it’s very common just to give money at a lot of occasions, like communions, godparents give money to their godchildren at certain feast holidays, etc
I can count on one hand the number of times I received a gift I actually liked, so I’m fine with the money haha
Interesting, no it does not mean envelope but rather cutlery/place setting, basically meaning you are paying for your meal
However the two probably share an etymology because cubierto more technically means “covered,” like an envelope covers :)
The old imperial flag, the Cross of Burgundy
I think it's more beautiful than the rojigualda, but sadly, today that flag is used by far-right movements and is the emblem of the Carlists
For Spain i saw one which was red white yellow in horizontal lines like Hungary, fucking lives it thougth i think it was meant for a united Iberia
I'd swap the bottom red with purple
I like purple
Back to the [Republican flag] The purple band is obviously different but notice also that the royal crown is replaced by a mural crown
The band ratio also changes from 1:2:1 to 1:1:1, but I actually prefer the 1:2:1 ratio as it's more unique
So my ideal flag would be something like [this] but horizontal (best picture I could find with 1:2:1 ratio)
I would only leave the colours so its like this  but the red is 2/3 and the yellow 1/3, simetric and simple
The old one, the one that caused terror in all Europe when we were the baddies
Maybe with purple instead of red to appease the (second) republicans
Add two legs
Or go all-in and add 5 and become a spider
One of my favorite flags for these reasons
Even the proportions
I feel like that would be too similar to the black and grey crosses on nazi tanks and such
Your flag is beautiful and perfect the way it is
It's also called the Cross of burgundy, one of the territories of our empire, not the Cross of Spain
So it doesn't really represent our current nation, or at least not originally
I mean, if you reunified, you probably have to end up changing the constitution anyway
Why isnt that a thing
Yet
I don't think it's common to charge a fixed rent but at least help to pay the bills and food
If you're living at your parent's and working (which is very common) and you don't collaborate it's because you're either spoiled or ungrateful
Depends on context
It's not normal while they have to study and find their forst work
Then maybe you have to help with the house costs, bit not a fixed ammount
As others said, it's very uncommon in Spain
Both because family culture and because with our job market that would be pointless, since taking away any amount from your children will only make them stay longer, not being able to afford moving out
It is common for older generations to own one or several housing units as opposed to renting, which is done by said young people that don't have the financial security to buy, so if your parents own the place (no or very little mortgage left) why charge when they can help you moving out
Of course if the family is humble or struggling you give everything to keep afloat, or if you're not studying and deciding to work it's normal to collaborate, but as long as you're studying and in need of support it would be both frowned upon and impracticable
I think that's the norm in the majority of Europe
Well, in Spain we had [Copito de Nieve]  it was an albino gorilla who was pretty loved
Sadly, it passed away on 2003
My granny has one of those *galos*, so typical haha
That we have a lisp
In most areas of Spain we pronounce the z and c (if it's in front of e/i) like a th sound and the s like a proper s. I think a small area lisps most of the time, but all of Spanish Speaking America do an almost s sound with z/c, and even the South of Spain
Edit: i don't know other ways to describe Spanish, maybe a boring version of Italian
I've been told Castilian Spanish sounds like Greek, and I have to agree
i'm sorry but these really make sense, Dutch is so guttural
It also depends on who speaks it, I know a Dutch person who doesn't sound guttural when speaking it, and i've heard some Dutch songs that sounded pleasant to listen to
(BTW i'm not saying Dutch sounds horrible or anything, i don't know how to say it doesn't sound really strong)
Makes sense
Finnish pronunciation is not too hard as a Spaniard, and Japanese doesn't sound too weird either
Basque sounds like Spanish
Since when
Edit: As you guys have pointed out the problem is that as a native speaker I can tell the difference, but to non native they sound practically identical
Is it because that's just how Basque works or because of the influence of the Spanish language over the years
Especially since standard Basque is artificial so it'd make sense that it lost some of its accent
If that's the case then it kind of sucks for Basque
But if that's how it's always sounded then good
I still don't understand the lisp thing
English use words like Thanks, Think, etc
and nobody say they have a lisp
"Wow, you Spanish guys speak SO fast" is the most common description I get from foreigners
Admittedly the lisp thing drives me crazy
A lisp is a speech impediment, the z sound is just a goddamn sound, like any other sounds like n, b or t! Especially when it comes from an English speaker
It's like, dude, you have it in your own language, wtf
As of how it sounds, I've been told we sound basically like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yeah here in the canaries we pronounce our z as an s aswell with one notable exception (that I know of atleast) being Zara (the clothes/ home decor store that everyone's mums adore) and the same goes for the c which to be honest I had no idea was pronounced differently
It's like they have a metrome when speaking . I like it
You guys are scary
Is szrzcz a word in Polish
I thought consonant-only words weren't a thing in Polish
Phonology is very similar
5 same vowels and very similar consonants
Basque from Guizpuzkoa doesn't as it has lots of "sh" sounds (x = sh, tx = tsh), but Basque from Bizkaia has pretty much the same sounds as Spanish (x = s, tx = ts)
I think that's because spanish words roll off the tongue really easily
No vowels last longer than others, unless the speaker wants to give an effect to what they're saying
Consonant agrupations like -mbr- or -rm- don't take long to pronounce, and words connect with each other really fluently
And in case a word is complicated or doesn't fit THAT well in the sentence phonetically, most people will just not pronounce it correctly and still be understood
I've noticed that in english there are really weird consonant agrupations like "tasks" or "lists" that really slow down the speech, as you have to say "sks" (which i struggle with) and then separate it from the next word a bit
There are also words like "bee", "long" or "keep", that take longer to pronounce because it's a long vowel
I don't think we have those in spanish, english is interesting for these things
Any Spaniard would say Italian is a sexier version of Spanish
Lol, that's how we see Italian, a sexier version of Spanish :)
I guess it's always the other way around, for us Italian is sexier
If you watch national TV, most people speak with the "standard accent", from the Madrid-Castilla area
I didn't know how Canarians spoke until I watched a video, i somehow imagined you spoke like we do
It is funny how Latin Americans think ceceo is common in Spain when it is used only in some parts of Andalusia
Despite the coughing Dutch is a nice language (i hope i'm not the only one who thinks this)
What is common in some parts of Andalucia is "ceceo". In the rest of Spain there is a difference between, for instance,  "caso" \[kaso\] and "cazo" \[*kaθo*\], but in parts of Seville or Huelva they would pronounce both \[*kaθo*\]
For some reason, there seems to be a certain stigma to "ceceo" in these regions, so it's apparently disappearing from the Andalusian accent
A lisp is a speech impediment (called "Sigmatismo" in Spanish)
Pronunciation of c/z in Spain is not a lisp, it is the correct pronunciation of the phoneme in our dialect
The same that when you say Thanks you are using the correct pronunciation for your phoneme in English
Both languages use different letters for the same sound, Spanish c/z and English use th
But that is spelling, the sound is the same
So, no, there are not 40 million  Spaniards with a speech impediment
I agree
We can say a full-length sentence in one single (long) blow, by connecting one word with another (in poetry, that's called 'sinalefa'), and I think that makes for a beautiful flow
Yeah standard accent I can understand perfectly fine it's only  other minority accents that I struggle with but that's mainly because A: my parents are British so I mainly watch English TV and B: you generally don't meet many tourists from Catalunia in the Canaries
I think maybe in Mexico they would use the ceceo for people who use the zeta sound, because they don't use the sound, when in reality for us ceceo is using the zeta sound for everything
I legit thought you was insulting me lol
Oh wow that's really interesting
I guess the different sounds sexier haha, I remember during my teens many times me and my friends pretended to be Italian to boost our chances in parties or clubs
Thank you Italy for the contributions that your countrymen have done to Spanish culture and science
[Juanelo Turriano] and [Alejandro Malaspina] are the first that came to mind, but there are many others
I’d like to thank Germany for A4 paper
Best paper size ever
And France for modern law coding and government structures set up during the 29th century after we modeled our democracy
Also Germany for its constitution, model to the Spanish one
Denmark for Legos and industrial design
The UK for music and the Monthy Python
Italy for these small house appliances they produce like Vaporetta
Poland for the books by Alexandra Mizielinska and Daniel Mizielinski that my baby read every day
Thanks Sweden and UK for your music
Thanks Switzerland for your privacy laws
Thanks Germany for your top tier industry
Thanks France and Italy for being nice role models for Spain
Thanks Portugal for being there with us even in the toughest of times
Thanks to all those in Europe that think we have more in common than not and make an effort to keep us united
Germans, good tourists (I'm from Mallorca, they take the island every summer) and not as cold as the stereotypes say
Can't thank Italy enough for the Roman empire and the Renaissance
Oh and the food too
The great Spanish general Ambrosio Spínola was actually Italian
Say thanks for A4
You are the fucking man
Thank you
Nobody thanked us and you touch my heart
I thank you, Bulgaria, because one of my best friends and probably the person that most makes m**e** laugh is from Sofia
You are right, I was mainly focusing on science and culture, but military leaders like Spinola, Farnesio or Andrea Doria were very important for Spain
Our former King was actually born in Rome
Biggest fish market in Europe is in Madrid
Omg green wine and vinho pressão. YUM
Boooffffff, sardines and green wine, erotic fantasy to me
My flat has a door that locks automatically so the minute it's closed, no one can open from outside
I was once sitting in my living room, in an apartment where the door led to the street (in the US), and luckily it was locked because I saw the knob being moved, someone trying to get in
I shudder to think what would have happened
Another time I lived in a high rise where you needed a key to come in ( in the UAE) and i would not lock the doors during the day at first
I was in my room and heard my  cat growl like a dog and I walked out and saw that someone had opened and closed my front door (I had something hanging from the knob that was moving
So I walked to the door to lock it at the same time they started to open it again
Since then I've never left a door unlocked
I live alone and I do it just so I don't forget to get the keys
I always lock the door and leave the keys in the lock, so I have to unlock the door before going out, minimizing the chances of forgetting the keys
I always do, I've never had any problem or robbery but I have a little daughter that knows how to open doors so it's better to lock it
As a general rule, all front doors are locked from the outside and can only be opened from the inside, locked with the key or not
Personally I lock the door with the key at night or when there is no one in the flat, bcs it's very easy to bypass the automatic lock if someone really wants to enter the house (a friend of mine left his keys inside his flat and we managed to get in using the library card because the lock was very basic)
Whenever I have had to move flat I have always appreciated if the door had an armoured lock or a vertical lock in addition to the horizontal one
Why so much paranoia
Because in Spain, especially in seaside areas in summer, there was a time when it was common for burglars to mark the frames of doors that were easy to open and then break in and steal
I can't even imagine if doors didn't have automatic locks
For people worried about what happens if you forget your keys and how annoying it's that ppl can't visit you without having to knock on the door: it's a cultural issue
You don't forget your keys any more than you forget your mobile phone or wallet, and it's something you do "from birth", something we have internalised
If someone visits you, it's normal for them to tell you first, so getting up to open the door is no bother at all
What would be really annoying is if they showed up in my living room while I'm in my underwear and drooling on the sofa
Bless all the locking doors
And those of you who are thinking about how uncomfortable it's to go out in the garden and so on, we're the second country in the EU with the highest % of people living in flats, many of us have only seen a real garden on TV
That sounds terrifying
Yon meid jis güei tu e tavern zru de dark forest, onli tu faind aut dat ji forgot de moni
In Spanish, it would be _”Yon meid jis güei tu a tavern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat ji forgot de moni”_
Spanish has not enough vowels and also the "J" in John cannot be represented
But it'd be something like this:
Jon meid jis uei tu a tavern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind out tat je forgot de moni
"John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money".
On Spanish:
Yon meyd jis wey chu a chavern zru de dark forest, onli chu faind aut that ji forgot de moni
Llon meid jis güey tu a tavern zru de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat ji forgot jis many
Spanish
Z sound is like th in Spain
They don’t have that sound in Latin America
The th in the is not present at the beginning of the word in Spanish and they would make a d sound
Many vowel sounds don’t exist and they are approximations to the Spanish five vowels
Something like this:
"Jon meid his uey tu a tavern zru de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat hi forgot de many"
Edit: It's curious how similar is to the polish one
Yon meid jis güey tu a tabern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat je forgot de moni
Creo que lo hubiese escrito igual y me la juego a que la inmensa mayoria de españoles también. Parece que somos la única banderita que pondríamos "moni" en vez de "mani". Lo mismo con "onli" en vez de "ounli". No sé si nos lo han enseñado así a todos o es que nos aferramos a nuestras vocales como percebes
¿Voy a tener que borrar el comentario porque una panda de pedantes sentados enfrente de una pantalla no podéis entender que es igual de incorrecto transcribir 'money' como 'moni' o 'mani'?
Las vocales en inglés son demasiado difíciles de transcribir al español, no es ni 'onli' ni 'ounly'; ni 'mani' ni 'moni', por eso lo he representado de la primera manera, ya que creo que se acerca algo más
It's just these sounds are difficult to represent with Spanish phonetics
I could've chosen 'mani' instead of 'moni' and it would be just as inaccurate
I do too
However I think it's not 'moni' or 'mani', it's an intermediate sound which I can't represent with Spanish phonetics
So basically there isnt a single good new as a popular subject in Europe at the moment
Is it just me or the world is a big shit these times
You know I never understood that saying
By definition an exception does not confirm something but negates it
In Spain we have 17 regions, which are further subdivided into a total of 50 smaller partitions (usually called provinces)
and we have 50 public universities
Therefore not much importance is given to which is the best, most students simply go to their nearest university or to the one they consider best for their field within their region
For example, I'm Andalusian and I studied at the University of Granada, which has a regional reputation in law and, above all, in medicine (the average mark required to enter medicine in Granada is usually very very high)
There re many students from all over the region and also many Erasmus students (because its WITHOUT DUBT the best university city to party)
Nowadays a university is pointed out as good if it gets you a job when you finish your studies, so the most prestigious universities are private universities in Madrid or Barcelona, with strong relationships with private companies
For Law in Spain, the best seems to be "Universidad Carlos III". It is a pretty new public university in the outskirts of Madrid
It has the reputation to be really progressive and with a vibrant student body
All true but usually the best scored Universities internationally are Pompeu Fabra, UPC, UAB and UB (from Catalonia) and Complutense, UPM and UAM (from Madrid)
Not in that order though
I would go with: Andorra and liechtenstein
I've been to Andorra, and it's a meh
The city is plain and the ski resorts expensive
Liechtenstein just feels uninteresting
I know some bits of their history and they were interesting but there's nothing that calls me
Of the big ones Germany has nothing (that I know) really that makes me say ‘oh id like to see that
Also the nordic countries look pretty dull to me, like the have a super good quality of life apparently but ... I don’t know, they look boring to death
If you've never been to the Pyrinees it may be cool to visit like 1 day
and that's it hahaha It's only cool if you want to skii
Yeah, I grew up visiting it every year (I, too, live very close) and we spent half the time buying liquor or cigarettes but I don't smoke and the price isn't that good anymore
You can go skiing but I have other places nearby too
You have Kofola
That alone makes you one of the best countries in the world
Sincerely everything you consider a given
Great expanses of pine forests, lakes and swamps
Coming from spain lakes and swamps aren't actually our strong point
neither are great expanses of flat forest
It's just a nice change of enviroment
I have to give a shout out for belgium
It's a nice country, often overlooked because of its neighbours
However, many things we think of as dutch or french actually come from belgium
Think renaissance cities and french fries with mussles
Good food, good beer, really nice cities and an interesting culture, and if you're bored you can always try to figure out their government and win a millions dollars by actually doing It
or die trying
Try chocolate
And actually a lot of things people think are French but ar Belgian
I dont know why I defend them when they hate us but
Well hate wasnt what the op was asking for lol
The music
Lol only for The Cranberries they’re adorable
Yes you also can, but Andorra has a really good connection with Barcelona, it's only 2:30h, other good skii places in Catalonia are 2h minimum, so it's not really a problem to do 30min more to reach Andorra
Bah
Slovakia is way comfier as a whole, so Czechs got 1 point and you Slovaks got 2 points :D
Well,you underestimate finland
You have more than 180
000 lakes and a great reputation across Europe
Even if Russia has the same Laky, swampy, foresty territory they haven't showed It to the world
I think theirs IS also more dispersed and worse connected
No worries I was kidding
I always name the 3 together because I used to point their positions wrongly in a map all the time (and their capitals too)
Now I don't mix them, but sadly I still don't know many things about those 3 countries…
It's funny because in Spanish Latvia is called "Letonia" so saying the three names is like a pun with rhyme: Estonia, Letonia y Lituania
"Good for you" also translates quite rudely to Spanish, as in "yeah, whatever, good for you". I've never heard it with a non-sarcastic undertone and was really confused to hear it in English being used unironically
Also the way brits say "lovely" comes off as super snobby and kinda wierd
Usually compliments can be perceived as rude, such as "Mira, guapa" (Look, beautiful), it is usually preceded to a row or scolding
Depends on what you compare it to
By world standards, we're not corrupt
Many countries in South America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe are FAR worse
But by Western European standards we're above average (more corruption than the average, I mean)
In general there is a lot of drive to fight corruption, it is investigated and corruption cases are constantly being discovered, which is a bad thing because it means they exist, but also a good thing because it means it's being fought
One of the most corrupt of Western Europe alongside Italy, but less corrupt than the East
Spain: hold my beer
Our previous president (Rajoy) had to leave due to a "moción de censura" (vote of no confidence) because his party huge amount of corruption scandals
The most corrupt country in West Europe
I think it's because there are a lot of old people, and they keep voting for the two old political parties, and those are the most corrupt ones
I said that because I remember one time my History teacher, who is always making fun of everything, wanted to show us how corrupt our government was, and he showed us a list of the most corrupt countrys
In fact, I don't know the year that list was based on or if it was a reliable source
Well, it's supernice to write here, one of the subs i enjoy the most, so no wonder :D
You think that if we get that many we can finally invade it
must be because all the  pączki  foodporn they're posting today :D
[El Concierto de Aranjuez, de Joaquín Rodrigo] If Spain was music, I'm sure it would sound like this
For Spain I'd definitely say [Entre dos aguas ] by Paco de Lucía
In catalan I would say it's "el cant dels ocells". Everytime I listen to it I get goosebumps
[el cant dels ocells ]
For me, is definitely this one, [El Gato Montés]
Hear it, it's beautiful
EDIT: These types of songs or "pasadobles", as are known in spanish, are played before or after a bullfight
I don't like bullfighting, but I love this kind of songs
[An example of this song playing before a bullfight ]
Boig per tu - Sau
(it's in catalan, not spanish, but it's beautiful)
I also love Debussy’s Arabesque No
1 and Prelude (I) from Suite Bergamasque (the suite in which Clair de lune is the third piece/movement)
Non-piano wise I think the most beautiful piece could easily be Ravel’s String quartet in F Major
Gorgeous
Shut up British citizen, don't flex to the rest of us
The same around here
Olive this
Some people here already suggested an EU-wide high speed rail network, but I'd suggest enlarging Airbus to ESA levels of European implication and developing the first commercial "ecological" planes (hydrogen, electricity
As the first models would be for domestic flights, we'd eventually replace the kerosene planes
I know it's toward outside the EU, but I think it would be great (and not so difficult) to make a runner connecting Spain with Morocco (read Ceuta/Melilla)
It's much shorter than Helsinki-Tallinn and having a corridor to our neighbouring continent has so much potential
Easing travel and commerce, increasing the influence of our consolidated democracies to help other countries develop, etc
Edit: of course I misspelt the most important word of the comment
*tunnel, I meant tunnel
I know it's toward outside the EU, but I think it would be great (and not so difficult) to make a runner connecting Spain with Morocco (read Ceuta/Melilla)

[Open-source computing hardware] (Semiconductor factories are pretty large)
Since they all use standard gauge rails I think we should keep the trains each country uses
Stations would look like airports where you see planes from all over
Plus I just want to see a Talgo 350 in, like, Austria so I can point and be like "my boi".
It sounds great, but except for the environment part I don´t see why people would use trains instead of a plane for a distance over 500km or so
Like no one would take a train from Madrid to Paris that may take over 7-8 hours when the plane does it in 2 and has no stops in the middle
I can see such a network working around central Europe, but for the North and South it doesn´t would be as effective and probably not really used
And it would be crazy expensive for the user, in Japan the Shinkansen is normally two times (or even 3/4) more expensive than the plane, because of how costly it is to mantain on such distances
Good luck with that
My country doesn't even have standardized secondary education on its own territory, each region creates their own rules
It's not
For those of us living in mountainous areas, the train networks are still very bad
I hate flying and adore trains and wish we could take a train quickly anywhere, but I feel making fuel-efficient airplanes is a more likely and immediate goal that will serve the most people
I don't think that would be a smart move
That´s true for a certain distance, but it´s definitely not the case for long distances
For example, I don´t think people would take a train Madrid-Amsterdam, even if high speed, because it would be probably 6-8 hours longer, and also more expensive than a plane
Planes are horrible for the environment, but for a distance longer than 600/800km they´re still the most effective, comfortable and cheapest way of transport
If there´s something that has made people travelling across Europe so much, it´s plane tickets, specially for the non-central parts of Europe
A train from Belgium to Germany sounds all nice, but one from Spain to Italy and you see it makes 0 sense at all
>What China has been doing over the last 10 years with expanding their 350 km/h high speed rail network is definitely something Europe should take after
We already connected Madrid and Barcelona with the French border with a HSL designed for 350Km/h (trains currently running in the line capped at 320Km/h though), but at the French side of the border there's a conventional rail line so no high speed connection at all :(
If France doesn't connect us, we cannot connect to the rest of Europe, given that Portugal isn't very interested in a HS link either
Nah, Portugal is our favourite rectangle
I agree, there needs to be a change for the environment, planes pollute way too much and for short distances they should be used as less as possible, but we cant lie saying trains are more comfortable for long distances, when they just are not
Planes, if we like it or not, are a vital part of globalization and the modern world, we can´t just pretend we use trains from now on for everything
Would love that if it were possible
We could build a station in each Balearic Island
I agree with the climate part, but I think people don´t realize how crazy expensive high speed trains are
You compared the case of Japan
I live in here, and for a longer distance, the train ticket (shinkansen) is usually 2 or 3 times more expensive than the plane ticket
A lot of taxes would need to go into it for the price being so low that people actually use it in Europe, specially with the different economic power people have
Someone in the Netherlands my be able to afford it, but someone in Spain or Croatia not, and then the whole system makes no sense
Teruel, The region even created a political party [Teruel existe] (Teruel exists)
Also Murcia
To be fair, the political party was created to raise awareness of the "España vacía" Or empty Spain, which refers to how places like herself and rural areas in general almost don't have population, there are even empty towns being sold
Also Cuenca
The joke isn't about its existence, is about how far it's and not knowing where it is exactly
But the case of Teruel is because they feel abandonated by the government, not by the people (as in the case of Murcia)
Bonus points for the opposite
We invented the place of "Babia" and we use "You are on Babia" when someone is daydreaming
There is no such place as Babia
The yanks dropped two nukes there by accident and we couldn't even be bothered to clean them up, because it wasn't worth it at all
Babia existe
>Durante la Edad Media la realeza y las clases más altas acudían a pasar sus periodos vacacionales y disfrutar de una buena cacería, debido a la abundancia de presas que por allí habitaban
>Era un sitio idóneo como lugar de reposo, donde refugiarse y distraerse de los farragosos problemas en la Corte de León, por aquel entonces reino
>Muchas fueron las ocasiones en las que los cortesanos necesitaban consultar al monarca algún asunto de vital importancia pero no podían ser recibidos por éste debido a que se encontraba ausente de palacio pues estaba en Babia
It's actually a super nice place
Ive went there with my family ages ago
The mythos probably comes when the Vulcano in Santorini exploded and whole islands with different civilizations dissapeard
So the "original" legend comes from Greece´s sea
After that many other legends have emerged, including the legend of it being in the middle between Europe and America, on the Gibraltar street, etc
Yo tampoco
Simplemente lo he aceptado como una realidad
Take your propaganda out of here
If we count only Monarchs of Unified Spain since early 16th century, we have:
**Males**: Felipe, Carlos, Fernando, Luis, Amadeo, Alfonso and Juan Carlos
**Females**: Isabel
If we also include Regents then we can add Baldomero (my favourite) and María Cristina
If we include Kings of Castille, Leon, Asturias, Navarra, Aragon and the Moorish Caliphs and Emirs, we have a plenty
**Castille/Leon/Asturias/Galicia**
Male: Pelayo, Fáfila, Fruela, Aurelio, Silo, Mauregato, Bermudo, Ramiro, Ordoño, García, Fernando, Sancho, Alfonso, Enrique, Pedro, Juan

Well, that was fun
Edit: How could I forget Amadeo
Our best monarch no doubt, abdicated the crown because there was no hope in ruling this country
If I have male twins I'll call them Ramon Berenguer and Berenguer Ramon
Or perhaps rather not
Carlos, Felipe, Fernando and Alfonso are the most popular names in our royal family
Isabel and María + whatever for girls
But Visigoth kings are top tier
[Wamba] lol
Hoooo boy, im gonna go with the Visigoths
Ataúlfo, Sigerico, Walia, Teodorico I, Turismundo, Teodorico II, Eurico, Alarico II, Gesaleico, Teodorico III, Amalarico, Teudis, Teudiselo, Ágila, Atanagildo, Liuva I, Leovigildo, Recaredo, Liuva II, Witerico, Gundermaro, Sisebuto, Recaredo II, Suintila, Sisenando, Khintila, Tulga, Chindasvinto, Recesvinto, Wamba, Ervigio, Égica, Witiza, Ágila II and Rodrigo
Those are the 35 visigoth monarchs, from 395-711 BC, these fuckers died quickly
NO FERDINAND, FOR THE LAST TIME, YOU CANNOT CALL THE KID ADOLF (soz I had to do the joke)
That does not expand the list a whole lot: Carlos, Felipe, Fernando, Luis
How would you pronounce Fajsz
In Modern Family when Gloria teachs Spanish she teachs Italian in the Spanish version (it's ridiculous because we know in Colombia they speak Spanish)
&#x200B;
In Daredevil the Spanish speakers are turned portuguese speakers
&#x200B;
Sometimes the Spanish is left, so someone speak spanish and the listener doesn't understand until other person "translates" spanish to spanish
&#x200B;
Those are usually the changes made (Spanish to Italian, Spanish to Portuguese or Spanish with no changes)
[There's a Spanish youtuber who made videos about how they managed to translate parts in Spanish in series and movies, if you speak Spanish, you should give it a try]
Is Spain dubbing, when someone wants to refer to a family in Mexico, here they change to italian so it's reallu foreign but still some people can translate
Also, let's just no get started with the Sabrina's live action series in Spain
But I guess it is as ridiculous as the Spanish dub (Paolo is Italian, but any Spaniard could understand everything he said, so the dub sounds totally unbelievable )
Here Dora la Exploradora (it rhythms) teach English too, but it's dubbed to make her speak European Spanish
It teaches English in Spain too, obviously
Serbians are in love of Spanish-speaking culture because of telenovelas and Spanish soap operas being really popular there
It's that the Latino dubbing or the Spain one
Have you seen Extremadura's? It's similar but with a black stripe
Maybe you like it
The old one
> She does have a stereotypical mediterranean name
TIL
Spent some time in Belgrade and it is an incredibly vibrant city
Really cheap too, although not very pretty
I think in the version from Spain it works better because they just play a Colombian accent on her while the rest speak with an accent from Spain
It is also pretty common in Spain for rich old guys to marry young girls from Dominican Republic or Colombia as well
They don't make Gloria look dumb
Every Spaniard is going to say the Spanish omelette fight so I'm gonna say an underrated division in our country:
Nesquik or Colacao
Spanish omelette with or without onion
But there is only one right answer: onions make it better
With onion or without onion, in Spain there are traditional dish Tortilla de Patatas (omelette of potatoes
) And it can be done with or without onion, but if you like one of these, then you hate the other option
(Well, is an exaggeration, we don't hate, we are civilized people, and anyways it doesn't matter because all who like tortilla without onion are wrong, and they must to be exiliated, so)
Apart from the famous tortilla one, there's a division in how we say olive: 'Oliva' or 'Aceituna'.
I would say if you put onion or not in a tortilla with potato
Tortilla: cement or raw on the inside
Tortilla: onion or not
Paella: green beans or not
Paella: mixed
(No)
At least we can all unite in the fact that all divisions are either due to food or language
In Spain is made with mayonnaise (we call them "Russian salad")
It usually has boiled potato, boiled egg, tuna (and some optional extras)
Colacao Turbo or Nesquik
Always hated the "grumitos"
&#x200B;
Also, after being eating Nocilla all my life once I tasted Nutella, the Nocilla tastes like vomit, I guess Nocilla has butyric acid, like [american chocolate]
When I lived in the Philippines, I loved Milo
But here in Spain, I’m 100% team ColaCao
Yes
Nesquik was so much better (haven't had one in ages
Also, nocilla is better, but nutella is really good too
Colacao
It just tastes more to chocolate
Ahhh these words bring flashbacks of my lovely time in Crete
Same thing happened in Spain, started off as "el covid" after "el virus del covid" i guess
But at some point last year the media started using "la covid" after "la enfermedad covid". I still say "el covid", and oddly enough most people went back to calling it "el covid" as far as I can tell
Is a cake in the biscuit/cookie format: the better of the three worlds
And what was the result
Times like this I hate how quickly the pronunciation of a word can radically change by adding a single letter
To me, scone rhymes with cone, but add a C, and sconce sounds like gone
Here we go again
With onion, definitely
If I wanted egg and potatoes, I would have a fried egg with fries, which is a much better use of these two ingredients
Onion makes the tortilla for me
Just because you *concebollistas* say it louder doesn't mean you are right
im sorry but  i have to  disagree sir
Onion makes it perfect
But there is only one right answer: onions make it better
100% agree and on another note: dry Vs moist
I've encountered a couple of people who liked concrete for dinner
happy cake day
(its allowed to say this here, i hadnt see anyone saying it with the exception of one in a chat so i dont know if this its allowed)
Here the only thing i had see its to put the milk after you had heated the water, honestly no idea why
Ok, hear me out
Aren't the two sides equal
You flip it and it's the other way around
Yeah, we are civilized about it but it's pretty obvious that people who prefer it without onion are sociopaths who just want to watch the world burn to ashes
We keep em as far away as possible
>all who like tortilla without onion are wrong, and they must to be exiliated
I mean, can you really be spanish if you don't like onion
This also applies to “g” at the end of words, and even if I learnt to pronounce it like “sh” in English, I must admit that it was cringy af for me to hear someone saying “Duisbursh” :/
Obviously horchata is very good and tasty :P
Huh, is that why when I bought Hershey’s Kisses for the office, it was universally rejected by everyone except the South Americans
3 and 4 are perfect
2 and 5 are acceptable
We're the Ciudadanos of omelettes this time lol
However caramelized onion is ambrosia of the Gods
I realised reading your comment that people does exactly this with the butter from Soria (mounted butter with sugar and a bit of flavor)
This butter is pure sin and when people tries it, usually can't take only one
The eastern coast (what once was the kingdom of Aragon) says oliva, and the rest of Spain says aceituna
And in the aceituna part, we also say 'olivo' to the tree
I guess it's related with the use of Catalan and Aragonese
Edit: I forgot to add that in Murcia they say oliva too
People who have cats are psychopaths
Noted
Idk how south americans make chocolate, but it may be the cause
Um what is 1
If you have to eat a tortilla with a spoon, is it even a tortilla
Gordon Ramsey’s “It’s fookin RAW” comes to mind ngl
I'm a bit more on the liquid side
3 is perfect, 2 and 4 good, 5 acceptable
If someone brings 6 or god forbid 1 or 7 or that concrete block they call "8" I'm chasing them with a hatchet
Sadly here in Andalusia you usually find 6-7 (maybe sometimes 5)
Runny tortillas in bars is one of the few things I miss from the time I lived in Madrid :P
That's funny, I wouldn't consider that a sandwich
Here we call them "tostas" or "tostadas". We only call it "Sandwich" when referring to a two loafed conception made with tin bread . If the bread is a baguette, we call it "bocadillo".
It was a Beamtin from Krefeld hahaha
But anyone else said it right
Same here and we are not small
No matter how hard I try but I'll always mix Belgrade and Sarajevo at first, and later think: ok, Belgrade -> Serbia and Sarajevo -> Bosnia
Do you mean massive slave trade
And why not slaves
Iberians did nothing wrong
The main genocide in America was the smallpox
That does not mean Spain didn't kill, slave and destroy, but it was never a genocide
Colonization of America was brutal, but it was not a planned genocide as some claim, and it was mainly driven by greed
Many events of excessive cruelty by spanish settlers were condenmed by the authorities
Colonial times were not a wonderful tale of diversity as other people say
I think our history (European in general, Iberian in particular) must be treated ruthlessly but with justice
I've seen far-right Spaniards portraying the Spanish Empire as a fairy tale
Btw, happy cake day
We gave up Cuba, Puerto Rico and Philippines in 1898, and Ecuatorial Guinea and Western Sahara in the 1970s, but these last two were not important
The war of 1898 against the USA is know as the 'disaster of the 98' and it is a very important moment in Spanish history
In Spanish snail is said caracol which (if written cara col) traslates to cabbage face
In spanish,slug translates to "babosa" wich means slimy
Perezoso (Sloth) = Lazy One
Armadillo = Little Armored One
Polla de Agua (Moorhen) = Water Cock
Chotacabras (Owlet-Nightjar) = Kidgoats
Puercoespín (Porcupine) = Spiny Hog
Mariquita (Ladybug) = Originally Little Mary, now Little Faggot
Pito Real (Green Woodpecker) = Royal Dick
Leopardo (Leopard) = Brown Lion
Conejillo de Indias (Guinea Pig) = Little Rabbit from the Indies
Pavo Real (Peacock) = Royal Turkey
We also have "washing bear" in Catalan (ós rentador)
> Gürteltier _(belt animal)_
Please tell me that they’re called like that because their skin looks beltlike, and not because of
I would add "Slug" which translates to "slimy" (babosa) and "Guinea pig" which translates to "little rabbit from the Indias" (conejillo de indias)
In catalan "turkey" is translated to "Indian rooster" (gall dindi) and "bat" translates to "winged rat" (ratpenat)
Isn't "ratpenat" Rat(a) penada
Penada vol dir amb ales, alada
Edir: bat had a huge variety of names in catalan, another one ver well-known is "ratapinyada" pinyada comes from Latin: with feathers and by extension winged too
True
I couldn't remember other curious names :-)
Same in Castilian, but the use of "Mariquita" for "Little Mary" has fallen in disuse and the word become something else
QED [
Gotta love them liberators
Macarena and Aserjé. I don't think I need to remind people about them, lol
Aserejé fucking slaps my dude
As a total outsider I would say even though it's an oldie 99 Luftballoons is definitely a match for Germany
My name's Diego, I feel uncomfortable when I listen to it
The theme of the song is that the guy named "Diego" they talk about is so wasted that when he goes to the club and asks the DJ for his favourite song, Rapper's Delight, he can only mumble the words
If you think about it this way, this was probably the first mumble rap in history, lol
Ah, what a great summer dancing to this song with offended mood
Burrito, gasolina, dale
Are you implying that masterpieces like Dragonstea din tei, Aserejé or Barbie Girl aren't good
Two words:
Santiago
Calatrava
Also some new Madrid's metro ampliations have been on renovation works more time than other lines that were 60-100 years old
Any
Well
this would be a loooong story but I can sum up with one highlight
They built an airport in Castellon and no plane has ever take off or landed there
That's the level
[Pajares high speed train tunnel] connecting Asturies with the Meseta (the plains)
[Tunnel still on construction after 15 years] with no end in sight
The construction was started without due diligence going through underground water deposits
After 15 years they haven't managed to stop the constant leakage of water into the tunnel
They also stopped for a while because money
Well the Sagrada Familia was supposed to have been finished in the 1880s
We have the Castellón airport, Who is practically unused, and the Nuevo Mestalla, which was supposed to be the new stadium for Valencia, but is under construction  since 2009
What about demolishing and starting again
Many of his works aren't practical (Zubizuri bridge in Bilbao, Ponte della Costituzione in Venice) or did cost way much more than expected (City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, the Mälmo skyscraper or the WTC subway hub in NYC)
Where I live it's all normal and I also haven't seen anything on this on the news
I've stocked just because my kitchen is chronically understocked
I use to have lunch at work and bring dinner with me when I get back home
so just in the probable case that I get sent to work at home I've bought enough to survive without my work canteen
I think I'm the exception, people is buying as usual
Nope
Except for hand sanitizer, you can't find that anywhere
Masks probably too
Not that I know
We're too lazy to make dramas out of a stupid virus
Not here (Southern Spain), everything was normal at the supermarket yesterday
All normal in bratislava
People here are "buying" masks and hand hygiene gels but not toilet paper I don't know what people is trying to achieve with that
Not so much toilet paper and stuff, but for sure alcohol, hand sanitizer, and masks
I believe it started in Hong Kong, some people started to believe that you could make masks with it and a group stole a bunch of toilet paper (like 300 packs or something crazy like that), plus some started buying it, others saw this and started buying like crazy not really knowing why but guided by panic I’d say: you are in a difficult and dangerous situation for some and suddenly see tons of people buying this like crazy right
You think it may help survival, at least unconsciously
This spread through Hong Kong and then other countries started copying it (Australia, Japan
) and here we are today
(FYI this is just my opinion from comments and posts I saw on Reddit, I don’t watch the mainstream media usually so idk if they’re enforcing this behavior or what)
I like it, almost everyone including workers are with the family on sundays and can go outside and chill
It is cool
Maybe it is because in Spain it always was that way and I'm accustomed
I see most people go for beautiful concepts, so I will propose one based mostly on sound and my personal connection with it:
Almazara - olive press, the machine to produce olive oil, incredibly numerous in my region
I find it such a beautiful word with an extremely pleasing pronunciation
That was the name of the old USSR space station
This seems to have a similar meaning to the Portuguese *saudade* listed above
I love this one
We have 2 types:
Badly written English name's (Izan, Brayan, Richar, Danyel, etc
Very old name's (Hermenegildo, Martirio, Concepción, Arsacio, etc
"Gorotz", literally means "crap" in basque
I can't understand why people would call their kids that way
Either bad adaptations from English like "yerson" or "brayan", or fucking old names like "Fructuoso", "Otilio" or "Gumersindo"
Real talk
You could say "Dolores", which mean "pains", but I actually like that name
There are so many random old people's names like "Sandalio"
I wonder if far in the future it will become more common again
It hasn't even been a full century since Hitler's death so I wouldn't expect it to be normal yet
Kiki means quick sex in spanish
Sandalio is my "favourite" old name
TIL this also happens all over Europe, lmao
In Spanish it would be:
Maycol
Brayan
Jessica/Jésica
And yeah those are like no no names
just doesn't sound right
They are English names but the adaptation to Spanish it's weird
the spelling and the sounds doesn't match at all
It sounds a lot like the word "chándal" in spanish, which means tracksuit/sweatsuit
Wouldn't recommend using it as a name in a Spanish-speaking country
Stop saying "from a Romance-speaking perspective" as if you were an authority on the matter, or as if you speak for every Romance-language speaker
Many of the names you mention seem fine, and under what "beauty standards" are you basing your choices
What are the beauty standards of Romance languages
Nothing it's wrong perse, but movies and books and memes had given certain connotation to them
For example, in Spanish "El Brayan" it's a way to refering a certain kind of person, like a thieve and robber
Of course this is in a funny way, so that's why I say it
I don't know if that happens in Italy too
I don't really know a lot of them but pretty sure we invented the chupa-chups, the cable car and the mop
The most used one has to be the disposable hypodermic needle, invented by Manuel Jalón.
Other notable inventions are the submarine (by Isaac Peral), and the auto-gyro a predecessor to the helicopter (by Juan de la Cierva)
The submarine, the cigar, the mop, the astronaut suit, disposable syringe, gyro (without it helicopters wouldn't be able to fly), high speed train and the laryngoscope
Most flavoured crisps are okay, but WHY would you invent onion and garlic flavoured ones
Only seen them there when I went to Dublin and I personally didn't like them at all and there were no non-flavoured ones haha
I always thought Him was invented in Switzerland because in Spanish it's called the same as Geneva, Ginebra
Disposable needles
Game changer in medicine
The guitar
Pretty important instrument, I would say the most important musical instrument together with the piano
Also proper blinds
I think we also invented the cable car (i think it's called that in english but idk lol but teleférico)
We invented the lollipop and the mop too, if I remember correctly
Edit: *Chupa-chups
I want to say Hungary because of the Rubik's cube
But I'm not sure because I think the dynamo is Belgian but I'm not so sure
For me, a lollipop is like flat and a chupa-chups is like a sphere, idk what the actual difference is actually
The brand Chupa-Chups was created in Barcelona, but I don't actually know what is the difference
I guess it's what you're used to, because in Dublin everyone eats the garlic and onion ones but I can't even put them in my mouth lol
That sounds tasty and now I'm hungry ngl
Ofc, if the English invented it, it would be the YES card
Ah, idk why I thought it was Belgian I just had that idea lol
I imagine there were i just said i call sphere lollipops chupa-chups whether they are or not
I don't actually know the difference
Maybe they were 2 separate flavours but I'm like 90% certain there was something with garlic as well, but yeah those cheese and onions were there as well and i didn't like them either
It's probably just me but I can't deal with onion I really don't like it haha
It means Subscriber Identity Module, it was just a joke lol
Oh don't mind me it was the salt and vinegar one lol I don't even know why I can't remember already it was not even a year ago
I plan on returning next year so I guess I'll have to try the cheese and onion ones again haha
People hate Bologna in Spain, it only contributed to make university to last longer (in some cases) and unnecessarily more expensive
Damn, we have the same problem in Catalan and Spanish
In Spain you can't buy any alcohol after a certain hour (8 pm
) in stores or supermarkets
You can go to a pub, though
Before Bologna, some careers were 3 years and others 5
With Bologna all are 4 years, having to waste one more year and pay one more tuitition was a Bologna thing
Also, it made masters kind of mandatory, without a master you can't do much, so more expenses added, more years wasted
Here with its implantation were removed, 4 years is the only option (well, medicine is more, students have to do the MIR and that alone is 2-5 years)
Spain had its own problems during World War II, but it's not unheard of to here someone called a facha (short for fascista)
Not WW2, but here is still used "Facha" (derivative from "Fascist") to indicate alt-right/extreme conservatives
Maybe it's because there were already before the war a term in french for the kind of people who supported the Vichy Regime: facho
Similarly in Spain, the most close term would be "facha", though it also existed before before the Civil War
I find myself lucky that English is my first language and I think a less complicated language should be the international one, maybe a Latin based one like Spanish or French
It’s even worse being a native Spanish speaker, from Spain, and finding the audio guides in Mexican
I think it should be an Esperanto-like language
Agreed
Oh, that's a good idea
It never occured to me that you guys must have the same problem with Brazil
Yeah but Quebec is always pissed anyway

I loved Blade
So much hours of entertainment
Gris is also developed by a Spanish company IIRC, and it is an amazing game
Rime is also an amazing game developed by tequila works Wich is spanish
Also, Gris, an indie game
95% Of your buyers are Germans tbh hahahah
>Imperium
Not spanish, it was developed by the bulgarian Haemimont Games (same studio that developed Tzar, Omerta, Tropico 3, 4 and 5, Victor Vran, Surviving Mars
Oh, I had no idea
[I asked that a long time ago] Turns out they like to wörk even as a past-time
&#x200B;
Edit: fixed a typo in work
Wait for the next DLC
Eurotruck Simulator, nazi Germany edition
Explore the most famous
Wait, I'm gonna stop this joke before it gets darker
Just
Imagine
Places that you could visit
During nazi germany
Now we are talking
Y'know places people used to go by train, ruined places
that kind of destinations
21 days smoking weed
German and French series are great because they don't censor anything
They follow their own rules and create this complex and amazing stories that get you
I can't watch any more American or TV show that does stuff for the audience instead of the story
I really liked it, and the casting of the characters was spot on
I think you won't realise that until season 3, though
It gets really complicated, but I think it is worth watching until the end, don't be discouraged
Best old age character-young age character casting I've ever seen
I loved Dark
It went a bit downhill, in my opinion, but it doesn't become bad in the slightest
I only know one person who has watched it, but I think it's not that unpopular here
Wait until season 3, it's cconfusing as fuck
I'd like to thank the French for
*Oh shit, what do I thank the French for
The Borbons
No, that cannot be it
Wine
Rioja is better
Eeeh
They left
After a while
Fuck
We'll have to go with Portugal
I'd like to thank Portugal for their towels, I guess
Now really, I don't live near neighbouring countries, so I can't really answer
Although I would like to hear from Galician people how good their relation with Portugal is, I guess there must be a lot of cooperation in some aspects that are probably wholesome
Portuguese brothers, you are cool, and had been cool with us for the most part of our history
I would like to thank Andorra for helping with the taxes ;)
Thank you Andorra for the low taxes and skii slopes
We can thank France for they help against ETA, for accepting over 400
000 people during and after the Spanish Civil War, and for accepting over 200
000 Spanish people trying to earn they life nowadays in their country
We can thank France for showing us how to strike
Amén.
> We can thank France for they help against ETA
After being a shelter for many many years
Those 400
000 were interned into labor (slave) camps with very bad conditions and treated like shit
>thanks to the communists, socialists, anarchists and democrats of all countries who came to Spain to fight fascism
Which included many French people, to be fair
They just were not endorsed by the French government officially
It's not about the quality, afaik, but more about the price
Apparently they are substantially cheaper in Portugal, so people living near the border go there to buy them
Popular ones here are Casera, used for tinto de verano and other fizzy drinks, KAS which is like lemon and orange Fanta, and Aquarius which people drink mostly for stomach upset or to rehydrate after exercise
I think they have Aquarius in some other countries too but could be wrong
I would say a lot of regions have their own
In Galicia at parties we usually drink a mix with a local red wine that is so acid that you have to mix it with soda sugar water and you drink it from small ceramic bowls
Kas (and Bitter Kas), although nowadays it's not as popular as it was years ago
An orange flavoured soda called Kas (owned by Pepsico)
I'd say:
* Kas: pretty much the same thing as Fanta, available in two flavors, orange and lemon
People usually mix it with alcohol though
* Casera: they started selling plain soda but their soda is available in lots of different flavors now
* Trina: a fruit flavored drink which is popular amongst those who don't really like fizzy drinks, it's actually based off the original recipe which was also used for the French Orangina
* Mirinda: it was very popular in the 50s/60s but nowadays it's available in many flavors and it's hard to find it in Spain
Aquarius is an international beverage with origin in Japan and itsi part of the Coca-Cola company unlike kas and casera that even if you may find them abroad, casera is sold in south America, they're Spanish
You forget Trina(ranjus) which  is popular among people who don't like fizzy beverages
Ah KAS, the perfect companion for alcoholic beverages, way better than Fanta or god forbid it, Schweppes
Also in the Canary Islands you have this gum-like drink Clipper
But never seen "non alcoholic, unique drinks" in every region
I'd say La Casera (sugared soda) is the most famous singular one in Spain, and Kas
Also the direct rival of Fanta in Spain, Trina, which brands itself as having more juice
We've got ACE juices and chinotto (called Bitter Kas) in Spain too
it's actually based off the original recipe of the French Orangina, which was made by a guy from Valencia
Had no idea Trina was Spanish, I thought they had it everywhere
It's really good
I get it from vending machines sometimes when taking the train
Completely agree, I absolutely hate this change
I find it very annoying, and would love to disable it
My computer is in english, so there are no autotranslations, but on my phone, I have it set to Spanish (because Siri, but that’s a discussion for another time)
You never quite know what is going on
E: siri and phone are set to same language for consistency
No point in having the phone half way between languages
Yes
I understand why it's a thing, but why can't it be disabled
I actually discovered an [incredible japanese youtuber] thanks to this, because I was able to read the title of the video in English, but I don't like it for the most part
I don't hate it as much as everybody else does, tho
Oh, sorry
I didn’t explain myself
Mea culpa
When I use the map, I prefer getting oral directions
However, if you have the phone set to English, it completely mangles up the Spanish names to a ludicrous degree
(Both Apple Maps and Google Maps are guilty of this, fyi)
Since, once again, I prefer hearing instructions then reading them (in a high speed metal casket
), and spending time deciphering what the hell the assistant said is a good way to miss your exit, as we say in Spanish: blanco y en botella, I set the phone to Spanish
As for why Siri in Spanish: consistency; though it does lead to facepalm moments with my laptop, as it’s still in English, but Siri’s language is synchronized everywhere, so
yeah
Also-also, since my phone is essentially an extension of my mind, I find myself thinking more in Spanish, which I find peculiar
This is great, thanks
They are in english to me because of the automatic translation, I think, because it translates to Spanish if I use spanish youtube instead of GB, which is the one I use
Look at the comment the maker pins at the top, the name of the channel to me appears as "kiwami japan" but in the comment it is in japanese
Maybe I'm wrong tho
I don't think the situation is easy here
We can joke about it, we also have that running joke of "esto con Franco no pasaba" (this wouldn't happen with Franco) but you'd have to be careful in order to make it land .On a serious approach, there's still a lot of division between "The two Spains" and any discussion that brings Franco up will likely lead to a heated argument
There's also a lot of controversy any time a political decision involving Franco is adopted
For example, the recent exhumation of Franco's body was really controversial
There's also a lot of controversy with changing the name of streets and avenues, even with looking for the unfound bodies from the civil War
Apology for Francoism is currently not a crime, but a notable amount of people would be for its criminalisation and it's somewhat likely it will be in the near future
Not tabu , but you arent gonna start a conversation with a people that you dont know asking what they think abaut Franco
Also we are so radicalised that you had to be truly carefull
In the toodler schools our kids sing about Franco having an ass white and cleaning it with bleach at the rhythm pf our anthem, not taboo at all
Unfortunately we didn't have a cut from the past (our king was appointed by Franco) so fascism still runs rampant and we still have several streets with names of either prominent fascists or fascists institutions
Generally speaking, still unpopular to speak about it
I was born in the 80s, (Franco died in the 70s) and I feel that the democratic parties that came after the dictatorship failed to create a conciliatory environment between the detractors and the related to the regime
Waving a Spanish flag or feeling "proud" of your nation colours is frown upon and you'll be tagged as far right extremist and a Franco's sympathiser
Democratic rights in Spain are still very weak and we still carry some remains of the dictatorship disguised as democracy
We have the same kind of jokes in spain
We say, with franco, this wouldnt happen
If coronavirus hits spain, with franco, this wouldnt happen
If we win the world cup, with franco this wouldnt happen
If somebody that you like or that you dont wins an election
With franco this wouldnt happen
Uh I find rare in my social circles to openly defend Franco
>Apology for Francoism
Apology means to publicly express to be sorry about something in English, while in Spanish a very similar word (apología) means to publicly express approval for something
OP is using the second definition
Just clarifying as most people in the sub won't understand this
For me, I appreciate Franco for essentially protecting us from war in WWII
The Republic would have cost us an annexation by Germany and even more lives lost
It makes me kinda sad
I keep telling myself that we need a couple more generations to forgive and forget but the political parties and the media are not helping
> in my social circles
Key expression
Unfortunately there are still a non negligible number of people who support the regime, and you can see it especially in the supporters of VOX, most are at the very least blind to the biggest flaws of the regime
It's rare to have people outright defend Franco but not people who have more "neutral" positions that border the parody of extreme centrism
For example "at least he saved us from communism", "the republicans were just as bad", "it's the past and we should just forget about it" or "it's the past and we have to respect it and move on". It doesn't help that the mainstream political right wing was founded by the moderate faction of the regime in favour of democratisation, so I guess they constantly have to find excuses as to why the party founders were Francoists before the transition
And that applies to the right-wing media or to their electorate
I live in a traditionally conservative Region and you won't really find a lot of open apologist apart from some radicalised idiots
However, a lot of people have this "well, the past is in the past" "both sides were bad" kind of discourse
And I find a lot of people that even go a little further with this "Francoism was bad because it was a dictatorship but
he created SS, I lived well, Republic was very bad, he rebuilt the country
" kind of discourse, full of half truths or direct false statements
It seems to be two Spains for everything: respect for Franco vs fuck him, right vs left, monarchy vs republic, Catholicism vs secular, liberalism vs socialism, covid lockdown is destroying our economy vs stay at home, against Basque Country or Catalonia independence vs supporters of it, even when it comes to Real Madrid vs Barça there is always a side to take despite you are fan of another team
The funny thing is lately people categorize others based on your thoughts about one of these topics and assume you are a puppet without your own opinion and judgement capacity and you have to be aligned with one segment in everything
[Yes, basically]  It's a literary expression that describes the division between different ideologies in Spain
Some authors talk about three main divisions: right vs left; catholicism vs secularism; nationalism vs regionalisms
The Civil War had a very ideological component, and the aftermath had a strong repression against the defeated side
A lot of republican or leftists had to exile or were imprisoned or killed
Due to this events there's a big polarization between left and right in our country still today, and discussing different points of view in a rational and calm way is sometimes difficult
Not always, apology also has other meanings
Apology: a reasoned argument or writing in justification of something, typically a theory or religious doctrine
The republic probably wouldn't get involved in the war until the latest stages of it, why would they defend those powers who didn't help Spain at all
Officially no
Off the records there's probably some nostalgic in the party still, but I'd say they drift further away from Franco every generation
Also, years ago Vox (far right) wasn't important so if you were a Francoist nostalgic your only real option was PP
Now if you are a Francoist nostalgic you have Vox so I guess there are less francoists in PP now
kinda
not really, as recently they've separated themselves more from the far right
I'd assume it's all about the circles you move in
In some it would be 100% unacceptable, in others I'd be no big deal
Same here in Spain with Franco tbh
&#x200B;
Edit: I'm talking about the jokes, not the fascist nostalgia lol
Time goes way too fast
The end of WWII was 76 years ago
That's a very good insight
I think there is no way to undo 40 years of control over education, culture, religion, politics and the law in a few weeks
When Franco died and the Constitution was written, we basically went to sleep one night as a dictatorship and woke up a democracy
That doesn't work
For example, high-ranking Francoist judges, policemen, mayors, politicians, public servants
all of them stayed in their posts
That's bound to have ripples
Our first democratically elected president, hailed as a hero of democracy and after whom Madrid International Airport is named, was literally the secretary-general of Franco's single party (Falange)
You are absolutely right
Mostof the first democratic politicians were already politicians before the regime change, so it's really no big surprise how it was conducted
Spaniard here
You are very on point here
Glad that you know or recent history with that depth
>they were members of Opus Dei
There's the problem
>the Catholics were actively searched for to be killed
Not really, keep in mind that most Spaniards were Catholics at this time
The Catholic priests on the other hand
It was a general sentiment among the anarchists and communists in the Popular Front that antagonising the Catholic Church was a way of fighting against oppression
Which to be fair, it kinda was, as the church in this time was still very powerful and influencial in Spain, and it was widely regarded as incredibly corrupt (which, again, it kinda was, as mostly everyone with the slightest amount of power in Spain at the time)
Obviously though, killing priests and burning churches did nothing to favor the working class, but it was a fairly common thing in the initial revolution that surged to fight the coup in its early stages
It's also important to note that, paradogically, these Anarchist and Communist revolutions were also crucial in defending the Republic in 1936, as the Government's power was extremely limited and some key areas like Catalunya were heavily reliant on the revolutionary mililtias to defend themselves against the fascist for several months after the war started
well yeah, the fact that he accepted the bribes is all to it im just glad that we stayed out of the war
But what i’m saying, not to glorify franco he wasn’t the best of a human being, the republic would have gotten us into the war and it would’ve been far worse for spanish lives
I think one of the roots of the problem is the Transición. Which was about the best thing we could get at the time to restore democracy without a bloodshed, but still incredibly bad in a lot of ways
No, not at all, only the extremist far right
Even Vox (far right) doesn't present itself as the heir of Franco and doesn't directly praise Francoism (though they indirectly do, and we all know they are quite sympathetic with him)
PP (conservative) was actually founded by Manuel Fraga, a Francoist official, but they don't like being associated with Francoism at all
If you use this "PP is the heir of Francoism" argument they will quickly fight it
However, I think they often fail in openly antagonizing Francoism, e.g. they oftenly don't vote for changing street names or other actions condemning the dictatorship (for different reasons, but the outcome is usually the same)
Not publicly but they are
The most conservative but not far right party, Partido Popular, was transformed from Alianza Popular, a party founded by a former Franco ministry, Manuel Fraga
The thing is, they do this kind of stuff
They say they are not supporters of Franco and they don't have Francoist policies (they are liberal, Franco was autarchic), but when someone propose the changing of a statue or a street they look for some twisted argument to get away like "we can't erase History" "this person that will replace the street name was even worse because blablabla" etc
Or sometimes they simply go the abstention route
So I wouldn't call them Francoist or nostalgics but you know
they are kind of passive towards it
PP is a failure in Basque Country and Catalonia indeed, but probably it's because there are conservative alternatives
In Galicia it's pretty successful however, maybe it's because nationalism isn't that strong there
However I'm not that sure about their politics because I'm not from there, so I'm basically speculating
Spanish, as long as it's Spanish of Spain
I usually play in English if the game was originally made or conceived in that language, because translators tend to be faulty in two ways: 1) in genres like fantasy we don't always have equivalents for the whole mythology, so they use approximations that might lead to confusion in the story; and 2) since Spanish usually has longer words and phrases than English, when translating menus and labels they might have to use related but not really exact alternatives just to make them fit on the screen
I always play in my language unless the translation is very bad
English always and subtitles in English
I prefer spanish when the translation is good, but due to specifics of spanish, sometimes is difficult
I play all video games in Spanish
I live in the USA and those things are small pieces that bring me home
Also, if we want companies to localize and translate contents they need to feel the need for it
People from countries like Sweden
If you don’t protect your language and demand everything to be in your language, it is going to be endangered soon
I've become used to being forced to play certain games in English, but I preffer Spanish dub as long as its not horrible
Blizzard does an excellent job with localization for instance, and a Spanish publisher called FX Interactive did an outstanding job too
In Spanish they're called Tendo and Nendo
Which I love
Spanish translation of the game is outstanding
Anyway, in that case the original is in Japanese, so you're losing stuff either way
I haven't seen a lot of video games translated into latin american spanish
It's always on TV shows or films, but never video games
edit: too much spanglish
It's interesting because with movies and series I always default to English
But with videogames I do play in Spanish mostly
With the exception of Paradox's games becasue the translation is lackluster,  to say the least
Here in the Basque Country, we see people from the countryside as the strong rough neighbors who lift 200kg stones every day, fight wolves, live in those enormous houses and speak an inteligible Basque
When people from the rest of Spain stereotype us (from the cities) they use the same ones
SOME people from major cities make really rude remarks about the rest of the country already, let alone the "hicks" and "goatf\*\*\*rs" from rural areas
guess it depends
People from rural areas are way more conservative too, while generally speaking urban areas are more pogressive
Here in Spain, a lot of urban people think we are are rednecks, and in Galicia, they think we are cocaine addicts and goatfuckers, while they think that people from Basque Country are Spain's russians
Yet they come here on vacations, and they stand out A LOT, they dress like they think we dress, coming like they own the place
In their defense, everyone thinks they're assholes
I live in rural Galicia and can confirm that there's more than one cocaine addict goat fucker
Thought it is true that cocaine is more prevalent in the cities
True
Friend of mine went to Colombia, and got busted in the airport with a 1kg cocaine brick, and now is in a colombian prison in fuck knows where and he got himself a phone to tell everyone where he was
Do you feel that the languages you already speak are not "enough"?
When I couldn't speak English I used to think, "if English speakers do not feel the need to learn languages, then neither will I —  for I will speak English plus Spanish".
But since I am able to speak English, I have been feeling that it is not enough
Have you also felt the same
I can speak 4 languages and a bit of a 5th, I love the process of learning a language but I am too pefectionist
I can’t allow myself to learn more lengauges because I would want to spend many hours a day with grammar books
I need to focus on my career
I really want next summer to come so I can study the C2 level of German, that’s my level of craziness for languages
I had that feeling long ago, when i was young
i took classes of chinese, french and German at the same time
That's when i learned keeping Up a language recquires a lot of effort and contact
In the end i forgot everything i had learned
I just didn't practice enough
However I still think about It
Now i have a more practical approach
I want to live abroad, so when i decide where i'll learn the language with gusto
That doesn't mean someone can't learn a language without that push, of course they can
It just means that i've found keeping Up the language to be the hardest part for me and so i give it priority
One of the reasons why I feel it is not enough is because I somewhat feel *trapped*, boldly speaking
For example, if I were to move to other country (that is in the EU), I could only move to Ireland and Malta knowing only English
So I thought about what language to learn and got to the conclusion that it'll be French
Apart from  France being my neighbour country, I decided to learn it because of all the culture and the literature it has
I love reading, so if I knew French I could read French novels in their language and reach to content that I couldn't be able only speaking Spanish and English
>And when I get angry, I usually curse/think in Spanish
It makes sense
I think I only need to say that I am from Spain, so
As of today in Madrid, YES
I measured [32cm on the handrail of my balcony] this morning
I believe this is the most snow in the history of Madrid, and it’s still snowing
Edit: I realize this is completely out of context because I missed the word _lanterns_ . Facepalm
Double edit, since we’ve already gone down that path, here’s some more pics from [a walk around Madrid today]
I'm 33 years old and in all those years I've seen snow twice in my hometown
I hope this answers your question
Here in Spain the majority of population doesn't experience snow often
I didn't know about these lamps
The country, generally speaking, isn't prepared for snow storms
I won't have the pleasure
I live in the coast of Granada, there is no snow here
Seems like you've seen the news of Madrid having 30cm snow, it's the big news here now
It's more common to have snow in the mountains, regardless of latitude (even in the Teide volcano, in Tenerife, and also Sierra Nevada (lit
: snowy mountains)), and in the northern half of the peninsula
Haha exactly
Well, most shops are closed, there’s 0 traffic, even around the city center, and people are walking around drinking beers literally in the middle of the streets
The city is completely unprepared for this, which isn’t surprising because at least to my knowledge, this has never happened before
I know they are snow plowing the main highways, but the streets in the city are still completely covered in snow
Busses and taxis aren’t running today, it would be impossible to order from Uber eats for example, but the metro (subway) is still running
The public seems to love it, it’s such a novelty
I saw so many snow men out on my walk, so many parents pulling their kids down the street in sleds, and everyone seemed to be in a pretty joyful mood about it
I heard a lot of people saying things like “this is incredible
Yeah it is lucky it happened during the weekend
The city is already weakened by covid and something like this during the week would bring the city to its knees
at least it’s semi temporary but it’s supposed to be below -10 on Monday and Tuesday night so I guess it will all turn to ice
Lockdowns in Madrid right now depends on which neighborhood you’re in, my neighborhood along with _most_ of the rest of the city isn’t locked down [this website] has a map
It didn't explode, but 4 nukes fell in Spain during WW2, by accident, plutonium is still on the land and Spain has requested since then to USA to remove it
The UK, my adoptive country
What can I say
The thought of leaving you later this year makes me tear up
Portugal is so beautiful and Portuguese people are so lovely
Underrated country
Our brothers from another mother, we have so much to learn from you
Italy, also a brother from another mother, visiting you is like visiting a warm, quirky grandma that won't let me go until she's sure I've eaten enough
I feel at home in Italy
**Portugal,** I know it might seem like we don't care about you and usually act like the we're the only ones in the peninsula, but you are our brothers and we think you are really cool
**Italy**, our other brothers, you have a beautiful country and even though we like to brag about our food, yours is equally fantastic
**France,** yes
we think you are alright despite all our battles in sports
Google translate told me you just called my grandmother a bicycle cause everybody rides on it
I'm going down there and stealing your cod, caralho
Despite our mutual jokes I defend Portugal over any country in every conversation
We really think you are the coolest neighbros any country could ever ask for
The historical friendship between our countries is renewed every year in the Eurovision contest
For real though, even though you use way too many vowels for us to understand what you're saying we are fairly sure that you guys are nice
I love Portugal, I really do
Having lived all my life in Spain, I have only really heard bad things about France but never Portugal
I am actually considering moving there some day
From Spain
You're welcome, you need good vitamins to grow strong
Thank you Austria for being such a nice and beautiful country, the nature you have is impressive and your cities take your breath away, and you have an exciting medieval history
Dear Portugal,
We couldn't ever ask for a friendlier neighbor
We sound loud and annoying because every time we visit you, we are in complete awe
I wish we could learn more about Portuguese history and customs in our classes to get to know you better as it's, sadly, vastly disregarded
We envy you in lots of things and we always talk about how we should improve the same way you are doing
Sincerely, Iberian bro
Yeah, we know
After living in the UK for some time I've come to know your typical hooligans and I've learnt to discern them from the polite and nice British (easy to diferentiate them honestly)
We also have AH here but  luckily they tend to stay in our country
By the way beers aren't enough, turism is regretfully destroying my country while getting a few people rich but that's not your fault
The feeling goes both ways fratello mio
You got yourself a deal
In the meantime we are saying this we are moving the border stones a couple km to the West
Oh no
Had no idea
The thing is, we all are mostly nice people, and we envy you a lot
Portugal has had an awesome development and every time your country appear on our news we sigh deeply, daydreaming how could we do the same if we weren't ashamed of out politicians all the time
Southern Spain too, many more we could expect I guess
The thing is your style of pizza in Chicago I'm sure it's fucking amazing but we do an abomination of it
Same way Chinese food or kebabs are awful in most European countries and when you try the real deal it's delicious
I love drinking milk, particularly cold from the fridge in summer
So refreshing and filling
I can relate with you
I love drinking milk too
I drink minimum two glasses a day
People think is strange
Not because I drink milk but because I prefer just pure white cold milk instead of milk with chocolate or anything in it
I only have milk in my tea or coffee
Or cereal on the rare occasion I have cereal for breakfast
Used to love it when I was a kid, though
Milk in Spain isn’t great for drinking, IMO
I hate drinking just milk, milk with chocolate all the way, but just and only milk, yikes no
Im not a dairy guy in general
Cheese grossed me out, except on pizza
Yogurt and creamy things are not for me either
I’ll take a splash of milk in my coffee and that’s about it
Wait, wait, this is interesting
What kind of anise
A liquor
Please elaborate
I have anise seeds
I will make this tonight
Thank you for the recipe
EDIT: Formatting
There's a lot of ways to say that something is very far away
I'm not sure if there's something that specifically means in the middle of nowhere
Some expressions that I can think of (and literal translations) are:
Está en el culo del mundo (It's in the butt of the world)
En el quinto pino (In the fifth pine) This one has an origin story
Está a tomar por culo/a tomar vientos (It's to take it in the butt/ to take winds)
Donde dios perdió el mechero (Where god lost his lighter)
I'll edit if I can think of something more
We have many expressions but my favourite it's en el quinto pinto(in the fifth pine), could also be a tomar por culo which it translates weirdly as, something like where ypu take the ass, it doesn't really make much more sense in spanish but translated it's even worse
"Where Jesus lost the lighter" is a fun one used here
In Spanish we say _a tomar por culo_.. i guess the equivalent in English is “in the ass end of nowhere”
You can also say _donde Cristo perdió su mechero_ (where Jesus lost his lighter) why he lost his lighter, instead of his sandles, like in English, I don’t know
but you can also say “where Jesus lost his sandles” and that works too
In the Canary Islands I've heard "está en Cancún"
Which is "it's in Cancún" (a city in Mexico)
"Donde Cristo perdió el mechero"
Meaning Where Jesus Christ lost the lighter
It's obvious he didn't smoke but we use this sentence
Irse a Cuenca (Going to Cuenca)
Irse al quinto pino (Going to the fifth pine tree)
Irse a tomar por culo (Going to get assfucked)
It’s the same in Spanish _a tomar por culo_
Also, "en el quinto coño" (in the fifth cunt)
The less polite version of "En el quinto pino".
I heard all those except the Dios perdió el mechero
I also heard a lot "in Cuba" to refer yo somehting far, and "Where christ lost his sandals"/Donde Cristo perdió las sandlias, which is hilarious
Also Conchinina, corresponding to more or less Vietnam
>Donde dios perdió el mechero (Where god lost his lighter)
I never heard of that before
But I've heard of "Donde Napoleón perdió el gorro" (Where Napoleon lost his hat)
Edit: there's also "Estar alejado de la mano de Dios" (To be far away from God's hand)
I know an older expression that I still use: está en Sebastopol (it's in Sevastopol)
Sevastopol is an Ukrainian city
Along with Cochinchina and Pernambuco are old expressions used with real places on them
A bit outdated, but I have also heard, and I use it often because I like it "Está en Pernambuco" ("It's in Pernambuco", a region in Brazil)
Now that I think about it, I know about that mainly through Ibáñez's comics
I don't know if he coined the expression himself or only made more popular something that already existed
The most common I've heard are "está en Parla" = "it's in Parla" in Comunidad de Madrid
And "a tomar por culo de aquí" = I don't know how to translate it but it isn't very polite
One I've heard in the Canary Islands is "está en Cancún"
> I heard all those except the Dios perdió el mechero
I know it as *donde Cristo perdió el mechero* rather
I always thought it was "Donde Cristo perdió el gorro" intead of Napoleon
I have heard a different version of this one, " Donde Napoleón se cansó de andar " (where Napoleón got tired of walking)
"Vete a Parla" (Go to Parla) or "A mamarla a Parla" (Go to Parla to suck) is definitely an used expression here in Madrid (meaning f\*ck off)
I’ve always heard _donde Cristo perdió su mechero_
Why Jesus had a lighter
I don’t know
Precisely because he was a child slave living in a fucking desert planet where you had a deadly sandstorm almost every day
Id hate sand too
Besides, he is right: sand IS rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere
My case is close to yours
Family intern, working on ER (in spain doesent exist EM specialization, and family physicians are the ones who work in ER)
Also with aunto-inmune desease taking anti-TNF biological meds
In my hospital we work with surgical masks and no protective glasses unless we are facing high suspected case
For that cases we had to wear the full EPI with ffp2 masks, and that kits start to be in lack of stock
I have two partners already infected isolated in their homes, one is pregnant
Im afraid ill catch it very soon, my ER is a chaos, sustainable at the moment, but a chaos
Hahaha I guess we share same desease, with same treatment, same speciality and i guess also we are close each other, bc i work in Pontevedra (Galicia)
Lets see what will happen next days, but looks pretty bad
Good luck Irmao, Boa sorte para ti tamén!
We also eat snails lol
The inquisition
I don't know why is It called the spanish inquisition if even Liechstenstein killed more people than us
OP in Portugal the torero doesn't fight to the death, I think that's the reason your bullfighting is not so famous
I am not entirely famliar with the Inquisition but I recently read they weren't as bloody as our modern picture tends to depict them
Apparently their actions on "heretics" were pretty lenient, **obviously** in relation to the savagery of the period
I think it said it was mostly taxes and decreased privileges, people were always given the chance to "repent" and convert before stronger measures were taken, and killing people would only be done in extreme cases were the person wouldn't budge in their convictions
I'm obviously not trying to defend the fucking Inquisition lol, but to put it into perspective, witch burning in central Europe, and the whole Catholic/Protestant cleansing was way more brutal and extreme than the crimes of the Spanish Inquisition
Inquisition:
> According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three-century duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed (~2
7% of all cases)
Witch hunts:
> The classical period of witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America took place in the Early Modern period or about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 100,000 executions, with the most recent estimate at 40,000
Those chocolate things you put on your toasts are actually very nice
Same here
Do we
Nope, you're infamous for creating and controlling for centuries the triangular slave trade routes
In the south though
Heh heh heh
*saddens as ww2 flash backs happen*
In the middle too
I think it's possible that they don't talk that much about it because afaik the English themselves brought their slaves to North America
But most of the African slaves in the Spanish Americas were sold by the Portuguese and I think any Spaniard who knows a bit about history knows that
In the north too
I guess it would also be too expensive to switch to metric and having to change everything from road signs and billboards to scales
Even then, it personally gets on my nerves that the main Western cultural producer is also the only one who doesn't use metric (why do I have to google what 6 feet means in metres or how much kg 80 pounds are whenever I read an American book or watch an American series
Lazy translators who don't bother to pass them to metric don't help)
It's just a pet peeve of mine, but still
In the East too
I don't know about other European cities, but here in Spain it's not that rare to live in a 10-storey building
Our cities may not have huge CBDs, but they're quite dense already
Here in Spain we have those laws too
Listos o no ¡allá voy
Though if you mean when playing hide and seek, when "it" has stopped counting then you usually shout: "Ronda ronda, quien no se haya escondido que se esconda"
It translates as "Ronda ronda, whoever hasn't hidden go hide" It loses it's rhyme :(
"¡Listos o no, allá voy
" A literal translation
Listo o no, ¡allá voy
First time I've ever heard that sentence
Where I live we just shouted "Y CIEN
" (and a hundred) really loud
Also, you can translate "ronda" to "rounds" as in patrol rounds, which I think makes sense in the context of hide and seek
Where I live we say "Preparado o no, allá voy".
Same
And the person counting would skip numbers, like ... 55, 56, 57 and 100
Where I live we say
"Quien no se haya escondido, tiempo ha tenido"
This Is the real one
Not at all, it makes communication much easier if we both try to adapt our vocabulary
Spanish vocabulary can be really different depending on the country
Accents are different
I don't like it much when people from regions with *seseo* (American Spanish speakers and Southern Spanish speakers, who use the sound S for Z too) try to use *distinción*.
Distinción is standard Spanish from Spain, where Z and S are pronounced differently, but non native speakers of this variety always get the sounds wrong and it's a bit annoying
It makes it seem like they don't know which one is which and that they probably have bad orthography regarding those two
It's not really that bad, just a bit unnerving
I wouldn't mind either way, I used to consume tons of Latin American media so I know some slang from pretty much everywhere
I would not mind if they use my words or their own
Actually if they use their own I could learn something and we could have a laugh when we start to misunderstand each other on silly things haha
Talking about spanish
It's not that big of a deal, each place has it's own way of speaking
People from South América make fun of the way we refer to other people, while we make fun of their accent
no i dont care
it can be dificult sometimes but its fine
It's really weird when I hear a latino talking Spanish, but since both side of the ocean are connected with Internet I'm getting used to it
As an Andalusian person, when I was growing up I would be bothered because of this s/z exchange
Specially in my home town Cadiz is quite common for people to mix it in both directions (Z --> S and S --> Z) and as in my family we have "neutral" accent, I used to be very confused with this z/s thing as a child
Sometimes this accent (and probably others) make your native language seem like stolen, like they are not using your toy as it deserves, but I came to terms with this feeling and now I am actually in love with how maleable languages can be and how beautiful it is the bond created by sharing your mother tongue language
They do the same to spaniards anyways
Wow, today I learned
I had no idea fake Spanish people were a thing
There are Spanish people that do this here, though, mostly people from the south, so some may not be that fake haha
It always seemed like a silly thing to do in my opinion
Seseo is just as beautiful as distinción and failing at distinción may make people notice you even more
I dunno
My best friend (Andaluz) basically forced me to start differentiating because he thought it sounded bad otherwise
I'm very comfortable either way: I speak with seseo to family and with differentiation to everyone else
Well, your teacher probably shouldn't be teaching much then
I've heard Mexicans have a lot of trouble with their X too, because some foreign people will insist on pronouncing it always as an X instead of using a J for the right words
They're just regional variations, each country has their own and none of them is wrong
Americans learned the to pronounce the "z" wrong
Spanish comes from Spain, the rest of the countries learned it (wrong)
Spaniards wsre more focused into getting the gold from America rather than teachimg Spanish properly
Here a common struggle for students of Spanish
Spanish really is SUPER hard lol like I am a native speaker from Spain but trying to explain the grammar rules and sintaxis to non speakers just baffles me
I’m glad I learned English is much easier in my opinion
Yeah, English verbs are definitely easier
English pronunciation is quite hard, though, there's a lot of sounds that are written differently depending on the word
And there aren't really that many rules about it that you can learn
You basically have to memorize each word
Oh, sure, jokes are fine
It's just there's Spanish speakers that actually mean that stuff, and it doesn't show much knowledge about the topic
You got then an important milestone there
Haha
A hard one when you’re learning, at least for my friend was: “Pon lo que te sobre en el sobre sobre la mesa”
It is like why
Haha
Franco did it to have the same schedule as the third reich and it just never got changed back
The reality is that i think we like it
It's fucked up but we love that at 9:00pm the sun still shines in summer
we are outdoorsy and we enjoy that
but yeah our schedule is fucked up
Coincidentally, my great grandfather (born before Franco's dictatorship) used to say he got up at 5 am with the sun, and that now we were lazy and woke up late
It probably has more to do with the change of time than lazyness, as time changed, people weren't going to get up at 5 am and wait 2 hours for the sun to come up and work the farm in the dark
I always thought they really did get up super-early, but 5 am was the equivalent of 7 am
Anyway, as i've always lived like this it's weird to go to other countries where people have different timetables
I'm not sure what time you have lunch in Portugal, when i went we ate at home, but in Spain we have lunch at 2pm the earliest, and it's odd to adapt to eating at 1pm
The only thing I truly dislike about Portugal is the remaining classism
And the lack of Lemon Fanta, but that's a completely different conversation
I live in Galicia and I totally agree
It's so weird when in June there's still daylight at about 10
30 pm, but the sun does not rise until 7 am
We should be a couple hours behind
The problem is, we're so used to this now, we have developed some habits (late meals, sleeping, and social habits) so changing is difficult
I think you probably know this but Spain's timezone got changed by dictator Franco just to be in sync with the axis
Because we are used to it now, changing it again would bring a lot of problems in the everyday life
I love my 11
00 pm summer daylight on the West coast
it's fun to go to class in winter, it's still nightime/sunrise outside lmao
Only for like twenty minutes at most but it still catches my attention every time
I can't get used to that
Especially in places like Galicia
To be honest, when you eat outside and have a great lunch time and the weather is just perfect, warm with a soft breeze, you really feel in the mood to lay down and do nothing
World: I don't understand why everyone thinks all Spaniards take a siesta, hahaha
Personally, neither I nor anyone around me sleeps siesta
I don't want to say that nobody takes a siesta either
Many people do it occasionally in summer when at 15:00 pm and +35° you can only sleep or die (electricity here is very, very expensive, air conditioning is not always an option hahaha)
Also students in times of intensive study, or workers with split hours who need to renew their energy (it is very common that the working day is from 9:00-14:00 with two or three hours to eat at home with the family and return to work at 16:00 or 17:00 and keep working until 20:00 p.m.)
So for the people who do it, the nap is a matter of survival
It is not late if you use the sun as a reference, it just says a different number in the clock
Not as late but later than most yeah
We have a pretty fucked up schedule
Which is super nice for weekends and summer but terrible for weekdays
And absolutely, the timezone affects our habbits
Spanish winter is the kind of wet cold to get in your bones, at least on the West Coast
How is it in Ireland
Well, during the day we have a massive lunch a and at least me I sleep like at 16:00 for like an hour or two
It’s not necessarily hot we can take high 30s jaja
People from northern/central europe are aways so worried about going to sleep wuth a full stimach and i don't understand why haha
It must be some grandma legend stuff
Dinners here tend to be light so idk we are used to it
And people go to sleep at 23:30-12
So yeah
[Fries toast
You don't say a thing about the important issue, the Lemon Fanta
Yeah, that's right
The sun is usually coming up at 8
30-9 in winter, so it feels so much sooner
Yes
As you can see in this [chart] our schedule is not that out of the ordinary, just the numbers in the clock are shifted
23:30 more or less
Our schedule is fucked up tbh
Most people work until 7 so everything runs late
On weekends and summer it's nice though
But then When we party is like we start at 12:00-5:00 and that's sooo late
> What is weird to me is how long your lunch break is
Instead of it having 2 hours make it one hour and be home one hour earlier, seems the better option to me honestly
Yes
This is the real oddity in our schedule that is actually related to our culture
I hate it, but I understand why we have it
Lunch is the most important meal of the day for us, schools close at that hour and parents go pick up their children
Many people commute home just to eat, a problem is that if you can't, you have to wait that extra time because your workplace gets closed
Breakfast is really light here: Coffee, orange juice and maybe some toast with some olive oil and crusshed tomatto on it
That's it
The big meal is lunch
In Spain the correction fluid is called "tipex" because of the name of the brand "tipp-ex".
An edible candy on a stick is called "Chupa chups" because of the brand of the same name (in English is called lollipop)
Mnay are shared with English but others come from Spanish brands or foreign brands that are more popular here
-Nocilla, which is kinda like our Nutella
-Kleenex for paper tissues
-Coca-Cola for all colas
-Polo (Spanidh brand) for all popsicles
-Termo (Thermo)
-Frisbi (Frisbee)
-Aspirina (Aspirine)
-Jacuzzi for all hot tubs
-Ping-pong for table tennis
-Post-it for adhesive notes
-Pladur for plasterboards in construction
Tipp-ex is also used in Spain
tempo is almost never used in austria so i got very confused when i first heard a northern neighbor say it :)) usually i would say kleenex but i think that comes from my spanish side
otherwise just taschentuch
sad Nesquik noises
schwedenbomben xD
Gomina es una marca
Me siento engañado
Following the same example, in Spanish we use the word “cometa” for both “kite” and “comet”.
In spanish we have a few
In the 90% of the cases one of the meaning is "penis
Not really two meanings, but the word "cojones" (men balls)  in spanish has a shitload of different meanings depending on what word is preceded of succeeded by
There is a nice text on this (in spanish) by Perez-reverte, one of the best Spanish writers,
But it's *un cometa* (a comet) vs *una cometa* (a kite)
Tiene nombres mil, tiene nombres mil, tiene nombres mil, el miembro viril
r/Hornyjail ?
I once went to UK and there was a Spaniard frying some sausages in the middle of the street with a mini-grill
(It was near one of the main bridges, but can't remember which one)
When I went to see the Alhambra for the first time, I saw three different tourists in the Palacios Nazaríes touching the [plaster walls] like it was nothing
I spoke up about it to let them know it's not ok
I was surprised how blatant it was because they would start touching the walls right in front of everyone, even security monitors
Tourists eating oranges from the ornamental trees in Spanish towns, particularly Sevilla
They are not for eating as their bitter mouths discover a second after the fact
Tbf this is not a tourist-only issue
Many people are stupid like that on a regular basis
Just a couple of days ago a couple of ~50 years old men were in line for the bus just before me and as soon as they paid the driver they walked 3 steps and stopped literally in the middle of the corridor blocking anybody coming after them
And they knew I and other people were in line after them
I "politely" pointed the obvious with a "sir" and one of them obliviously apologized and moved aside
I can sort-of read French but if you speak it to me it's impossible
The spelling is there but the noises, like you said, are too different
canyo not
We call "Las provincias" for everything outside Barcelona and Madrid
In Spain we call it "el extrarradio" (the outskirts) but it is used for territories outside the center of the country, not just limited to the capital
It is derogatory: "de provincias".. from the provinces
Tho Barcelona equals Madrid in this case and it's not "province". As this makes reference to a more rural-not big city
Outside those big cities
It is
Same in Spain, "provincianos" is used by the people of Madrid to talk about the rest of the country
The stereotype of smug assholes is also the same
Never heard of that and I live in Madrid
I don't think in Spain it is really that common to group all the country except Madrid in a single statement
You mostly hear people talk about levante, the cantabric/North, the South, the meseta, the peninsula
I've never heard that, but then again I don't live in any of those cities so maybe that's why
In fact, I think if someone talked to me about "las provincias" I would have no freaking clue what they were talking about lol
I'd say it's not actually the same
We wouldn't call someone from San sebastian provinciano
I think it's less about the capital and more about a Big city
That way Barcelona is not included and "metropolitan" cities neither
Its mostly used for what is Generally perceived as small or "backwards" places
I think there's also a level of contrast
my aragonese friend would call anyone from anywhere in Aragon but  Zaragoza provinciano
I have a stepbrother in Extremadura and for him Plasencia, his home city, marks the limit on what's provinciano
I think Its more a somewhat peyorative term for "Camp folk" or anyone living in a smaller city than you
Barcelona is a big city
So does not apply to it
The term is used mainly towards people from small towns, no one would say that people from Barcelona are "provincianos".
Well, the attitude towards Barcelona and Cataluña (the region where Barcelona is) tends to be different but because of the whole independence issue there
Still, it tends to be a negative perception, although "provincianos" can be the people from Cataluña that are not from Barcelona
of course not everyone, but believe me I know people who wouldn't hesitate in calling someone from San Sebastián "provinciano"...it doesn't have any logic but it's not me who needs that explained
I think that's less the case nowadays but i may be wrong
I hope it's the less case as well, and it's just a small group that makes lots of noise you know
It happened to me in every country I've gone to, I think lol
The best one was in the UK, during an exchange
Our teacher was English, but she knew Spanish and we had no idea for at least the first 3-4 days
It was very funny when she said something in Spanish for the first time
It was shocking, and everyone started to freak out about what they may have said in front of her
Specially those who knew they said something mean about her xd
Such a double edge sword speaking openly about stuff when you think they won't understand you
It also happened to me with cashiers or baristas (? It was at a Starbucks, and I don't know how to call the people making the coffee) in Dublin, Frankfort and Toronto
Those moments were mostly cool, unlike the UK one that was embarrassing xd
I saw your user flag with my yellow screen night light activated and thought: *Austria
Isn't that Spain
Haha, what a bunch of bs
(Pun absolutely intended)
Spain is the same tbh
It is basically in our dna to shit on our country
The thing is, most people are only aware about the life they're living and focus on the shitty things
I grew up in Spain and I fucking hated it and was dreaming of moving to a more civilized place with better job opportunities
Well, after living 10 years in Germany, I'm often complaining about weather, food, language barriers, humour, etc and fantasizing about the life I had next to the Mediterranean
When I'm "all namaste" I think that each place has something to offer and we should enjoy it as is
but that doesn't happen every day
It's tradition at this point  But if you are an outsider and talk shit about this country prepare yourself
Both
By the way, in Catalan "God" and "10" are the same word: "Deu"
We shit on god, diez (ten), a whore/golden whore, the sea/salty sea, milk, your/our fucking mother, your/our fucking skull, your fucking dead (relatives), etc
Your imagination is the limit
Oh I know I know
I wasn't talking about you, just in general
I think in Spain you can wear whatever you want in some cities, but in others people are really posh
People are expected to wear nice clothes in public in general, so they may judge you a bit negatively if you don't fit in at all
Spaniard in London here
I think in general people don't dress that differently from people in, say, Madrid (another big capital), but there are differences, of course
I think you can find super well-dressed people in London, in two different ways: the elegant, posh ones, and the original, interesting ones
But then, depending on which area of London you are in, things change
There are areas where you see more of the sweatpants, hoodies, caps and gold chains kind of style, and other areas where everyone dresses really posh, but in a very uninteresting, uniform way
When it comes to going out, it also depends on the area
There's the hipster areas, the alternative areas, the areas where you see all those scantily clad girls in sub zero temperatures, with a ton of make up on, etc
I think these last ones stand out a lot because this is specifically a UK/Ireland phenomenon, as far as my experience in Europe goes, and there are many of them
But it's certainly not how everyone dresses
I do feel that there are more of the sweatpants, hoodies, etc
kind in the UK, compared to Spain
In Spain, there is this thing where people from some small towns try really hard to "dress well" (or their idea of what dressing well is) every day, for every ocassion
I feel this is the same in Italy as well, but my experience is limited
However, my opinion is that they sometimes overdo it in a "cheap" kind of way that immediately gives away they are from a small town (not that being from a small town is bad in any way
I agree with you, Dutch dress amazingly well
I cannot say the same about the Germans though
Oh yes, especially in Tübingen, white shirts are kind of an indicator of fraternities/ "Burschenschaft", which is very right leaning organisations or they assumed that you majored in economics, who sometimes are a bunch of bricks (not to stereotyp, but I study with them I know what I am talking about)
The perfume or aftershave thing at least for me is something I can't do
I hate them as they give me terrible headaches
I sometimes smell the person ten minutes after they left
To feel *uncomfortablely colorful* is a thing and I discovered it the first time I went to Germany
You don't need a Passport, you can just cross with your country ID, also there's no land frontier, so they're not going to ask for that ID
Yes you can travel freely inside the Schengen zone
There is no physical border and no passport control
If you have a EU passport, you can also legally live and work in the other EU countries without needed any sort of Visa, which is pretty dope
I'm French by I lived for a few years in the UK (before Brexit) and now I live in Spain
You still have to deal with bureaucracy and paperwork, but you are free to live where you want
That was a game changer
It feels so good to travel to another country and just keep the internet, it may sound stupid, but it make me feel "closer" to other EU countries
spanish language has around 4k words from arab language
some of them coming not from just words but from gramma, for example the femenine "the" (al or a) from arab it is now directly embebed in the word
ie: albaricoque - apricot; aceituna - olive
i know this could not be surprising but to me just looks beatiful, dont know why
My favorite in spanish is CHUMINO
Which is a very colloquial way to name the pussy/cunt
Apparently it comes from back in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the port of Malaga was one of the busiest and where many English ships arrived to load and unload
Crossing a street from their usual exercise rooms, the prostitutes would come out to wait for them at the port and when they sighted a boat they “received” the crew lifting their skirts
Over time, the authorities began to persecute this practice and the girls who were waiting in the port had to find ways to hide their welcome to the ships about to dock
Meanwhile on the ships, the English sailors accustomed to greeting with their skirts raised shouted to the ladies "SHOW ME NOW
". So in Spain "Showmenow" became in "Chumino" and now is a very popular word of our vocabulary
I love that this happens between the spanish languages:
Galician:  Pavo
Euskera:  Indioilar (Indian rooster)
Catalan: Gall d'indi (Indian rooster)
Spanish: Pavo (it is also the name of the Peacock (Pavo Real), so it probably comes from there)
Edit: The Euskera one was wrong and it seems that also the Galician one
DIEEE GOOOGLEEEEEE YOUR TRANSLATOR SUCKS
Edit2: Ok, so I don't know why, but google translate is not able to translate pavo from Spanish to a lot of languages, I've been checking and in a lot fo cases he decides to translate "Pavo" as "Turkey \[in the specific language\]", it's like the translator is first translating to English and then to the other language (this seems like the most logical answer)
So for example Spanish-Finnish =  Turkki, Spanish-Turkish =  Türkiye, etc
So sorry about the misinformation
> Spanish: Pavo (it is also the name of the Peacock (Pavo Real), so it probably comes from there)
It's actually the other way around
The original *pavo* is the *pavo real* (peacock)
After the *pavo* (turkey) was introduced they renamed the original *pavo* to *pavo real* because that's the "real" turkey
It's a bit counter intuitive because they renamed the original instead of the new one
But I'd say it's because the new one became more popular because it could be eaten, so they renamed the original, albeit less popular one
In some LatAm countries, it's called brasier, if it wasn't enough
What you are saying is right, but are you sure about the "real" part
For me pavo real mean "Royal peacock", not "real peacock".
Oh, sorry, you're right
I didn't knew the Basque one so I used google translate and it's giving the wrong answer
I will edit it
That's a common misconception because it's easy to assume *real* means royal
It makes sense right
Peacocks are flashy, elegant, royal
But no, it was named *real* as in "real" (*verdadero*) for the reasons I explained
Just research for a bit and you'll find what I say is true
I'd say one of the regional languages
Probably catalán as most of the Eastern coast either speak it or use a similar language/dialect
Followed by Basque and then Gallego
In Spain it must be french
When you reach secondary school (at 11, it's like 7th grade) you have to choose another language besides english, and french is the most popular one because people think it would be easier than others like german
If you mean native speakers
I honestly have no idea
I guess excluding all the other official languages (catalan, basque, gallego
) it would be French as a foreign language because it was learnt in school in the past, over english; and as native language maybe Romanian or *Arabic* as Romanians and Moroccans are the biggest immigrant groups in Spain
Here Spain
Oh this question is hard
especially for us but that makes the answer much more interesting
First off we have to get clear what you Meam by second language
As i see there are two ways of interpreting this:
1) you're asking us to ignore the mother tongue
2) you're asking us to ignore the most used tongue
That distinction IS IMPORTANT in our case
So lets go with 1) according to the INE (national estadistic institute) the most common second language amongst people between 18 and 64 is english
with a whopping 40% of speakers . Which means they're roughly counting everyone Who knows how to "defend" themselves
I'm telling this because they also assume 14% of people can speak french which puts It in first possition
This is almost as ludicruous as the 40% thing
which means that i'm going to ignore french though It has a higher percentage of "speakers" because of the abismal quality of the speakers they're counting
According to the study spain's most common second language (understood as not-the-mother-tongue and ignoring the previously satated "overstatement" in the study) is
SPANISH with 9
1% of the speakers
Confused
Well, Spain has about 5 million inmigrants and many don't have spanish as their native tongue
Furthermore there's catalan with around 5 million native speakers
which translates to 5 million second tongue spanish speakers
To that you have to add gallician and euskera native speakers
That's a lot of people
2) i Won't do it
this would be hell to Search for
because as far as i know we don't take that viewpoint in statistics
It may be french
but i would still bet for catalan
There's some people Who have just taken out the first language of the country and talked about the second
Spain's largest second language would be
no surprise catalan
BUT if you want the simpler answer more in tune  with the rest
french
it's by far the most taught language apart from english and the official and cofficial languages of Spain
Almost nobody talks It right but many know some basics
I for one studied french for 5 years and couldn't mantain even the simplest of conversations
I did French as extra language, still, I know nothing about French
The first one sure
The second one might be true but its much Closer that you make It seem
There are around 5 million non native catalan speakers
english IS harder to count as most census are seriously overstating our english but i wouldn't say less than 10% of our population which is 4 million (when excluding Catalonia)
It all depends on  what level of profficiency you're setting the bar at
I was about to say this
There's about 5 million native catalan speakers alone
and they all speak spanish (i think It was 98%)
well, yeah
it's true that I was counting only the languages that are not native from one's country (like catalan, basque, gallego
), but if we count them it would be catalán, yes
it depends on the school that they let you choose italian or not, and they are a minority
I personaly can speak some italian thanks to apps like duolingo, and surely if I did an erasmus in Italy I could learn it much better, I guess it's the same for the spaniards that you know
I'm curious about something (as I see that you are from Catalonia): isn't spanish and catalan "at the same level"? I mean that even if you choose to speak catalan as much as you can, don't you still need to speak and read spanish often
Making it both your "first language".
I mean for example talking to friends not from Catalonia of reading through mobile apps, in the street
I there's about 5 million native catalan speakers whose second language is spanish
There's also 5 million non-native catalan speakers but if you add all the inmigrants in the country Who have learned spanish i'd say spain's largest second language is well
spanish
That's a bit twisted, don't you think
I think by second language he meant anything but the native tongue
If not the whole thing gets really murky really fast
how do you count large inmigrant groups which now speak spanish
their language is now second
The language they speak with their family
how do you get statistics about how much catalan a person speaks in their day to day
And where do you put the boundary
Almost all them speaks spanish as a first language and then the regional as a second
Maybe not in the towns of Catalonia and Baleares
I am valencian and my first language is spanish
Ive been in Baleares, Basque Country and Galicia and I barely heard other language than spanish
We all know the basics
But that's it
Stuff like excel or anything fancy that's not changing colour to letters or fort size on word is a mystery
We had some courses at university and people struggled a lot
Yet all of the French people I know could make you a proper excel file about whatever
probably more than previous generations
But most people just use the computer as facebook machine or even the ones using it as a LoL machine dont really know much a lot of the time
Or just use smartphone and see their attention-span drop to minimums as they scroll through social media and whatsapp
Lol it's cool to get your kids on board with your hobbies, they may share them with you and it can be a cool experience for them, but to force them to do it to such an extent will probably just make them hate the game and despise you when you force them to play it
Very popular
Until the start of the pandemic there were talks to legalize the selling of weed
For now you can only have them legally via shady smokers clubs and by self cultivation
Id say almost everyone of Young age has smoked sometime in their lives, so very popular
Relatively popular among young people, I smoked a few times, a lot of young people have at least tried it, and I know people who consume regularly
My parents told me they both smoked weed when they were young too
Among older people it's rarer, though
I have a couple of relatives in their 50s I know smoke but that's it
Not my country, but in Germany there’s Jannik (that should be the standard because of the name coming from Jan Niklas) but there are endless versions such as Yannik, Yannick, Janick, etc
I find it so confusing, specially when you get a Jannik -ish client and have to write his name down
This also happens with Lukas/Lucas/Luka/Luca, Markus/Marcus and almost every name that contains a C or a K.
No, because Spanish it's written as it sounds
What we DO have are some "Karens" naming their kids with English names but writting them as Spanish names
Examples:
Ethan = Izan
Ryan = Rayan
Dylan = Dilan
I've seen people legally called Maikel here aswell, theres probably people with mispelled "Jonathan" or "Jenniffer"
There are definitely some name variations
I've seen Ainoa/Ainhoa, Helena/Elena, Elia/Elía just to name a few
I guess that's why Philip II of Macedon was assassinated, he named his son Alex
After reading your edit OP, I think we should create the flair "Please excuse my English" haha
I would say native speakers mix up those words more than non native speakers
Please English my excuse
I went from Spain to Ireland at your age during the peak of the crisis 8 years ago
First thing to bear in mind: there are hundreds like you there, which means you are not special for being an Italian young man looking for new horizons, it won't help you to find a job if you focus on that characteristic
Don't mention your condition unless they ask you explicitely, you better show how being in another country is nothing to be proud/ashamed of, just a normal thing for someone like you
Focus on your true skills and let language aside, most people focus on their multilingual capacity and, as I said, that is far too common in Ireland and UK as these countries are overcrowded by European inmigrants, specially from the South and East
Second advice, take your time to have fun and enjoy the experience
My first year in Ireland was terrible because I was stressed out by not finding a good job, only shitty ones, and feeling bad about expending my salary on beers and trips
Going out in Ireland is super expensive if you compare it to Spain so you have to do it differently, much more house parties and less pubs
My second year I started doing more things and I made more friends and this eventually helped me finding a good job
Good luck
I applaud you for moving to a new country, it's gonna be a great challenging experience
As many other people have said, you'll find what you are running from in many other countries, including Ireland
It's fine to want to go, but  try **to not be bitter about your home country**. Italy has a lot to offer and I hope one day you'll be able to see it
I'm French and I move to London, UK after my studies to be with my SO
I really enjoyed it, I could find a job relatively easily, and I was able to change sector without too much trouble (moving to tech)
The UK is far from perfect, but I found it was easy to fit, in at least in London, the bureaucracy is really easy to handle, and I liked the work culture
The country is beautiful ans has a lot to offer
And being payed in a British pound made visiting other country seemingly really affordable
But it's a place where if you lose your job you're completely fucked, and it's impossible to ever buy a place
Now with Brexit, it's a door that's closed for a lot of young unqualified Europeans
Then a few years later, we moved to Spain, looking for better weather and a more latin lifestyle
We found job easily (having a few more years of experience), and we both agree that our living conditions are much better here
Even though we originally earned less, our purchasing power was higher
Now I work for a remote company and it's even more enjoyable
I feel really lucky, I know Spain has a garbage economy and with Covid it's getting worse
Accommodation is expensive compare to salaries in bigger cities and the bureaucracy is a nightmare
I love the people, the language(s), the food, the Mediterranean weather, the landscapes
If you live in Madrid or Barcelona, it's really easy to integrate as a foreigner
There is no ideal condition, only compromises, and the more you spend time in a place, the more you will lose your rose-tinted glasses
I can't see myself going back to France at the moment
I feel like things are getting worse there, but when I take a step back, I also know that's it's a beautiful rich country with a solid social security system
I moved from Spain to Scotland 5 years ago and my experience so far has been positive
My reasons to move were quite similar to yours, lower salary, higher house prices, high rent, high unemployment
I started on a job for the first 3 years, then moved to a better-paid job for another 2 years and this year started to work independently achieving financial stability that didn´t get in Spain in 10 years since I graduated
I Live in a nice house near the coast, with stunning outdoor walks close to me and people has been nice and welcoming since day 1
I only regret not coming before
Obviously, I miss my family and friends, but Spain is only over 2 hours by flight and pre-covid very affordable trip
As someone mentioned before, enjoy your life
I have encountered numerous immigrants that want to save as much money as possible to come back to their countries or start some project and they live in the cheapest flat, eating beans and potatoes every day and not doing anything fun never ever because can´t spend money
Obviously, they hated the country, the people, their jobs and never realized is not the country they hated, but their lives
I'm currently living in Estonia but I'm planning to come back once I finish my master
Imagine wanting not to be able to do this
/*cries in UK*/
I actually moved to Cork during my second year and eventually came back to Spain
I liked Cork much more than Dublin in every sense
I eventually came back to Spain when the crisis went over
Even though I hope I'll never need to migrate again, I don't regret anything about my years in Ireland and I always encourage young people to do the same
You mean [this] right
It's called vía férrea (iron way/track) or línea ferrea (iron line) or ferrocarril (iron lane) but people usually says "vías del tren" (train's tracks)
And ferrocarril
Even being correct, it's true that people always say only "via" or "via del tren".
Yo estaba to confundio pensando que era algo que solo los yanquis tienen lol
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
"Via del tren" (singular) has way less results
En España también, para referirse al objeto en concreto (por ejemplo, "no te acerques a las vías")
Pero cuando se refiere uno a la red en general se suele usar ferrocarril
I wasn't talking about plural/singular, just about "via ferrea"
The inside of Spain is very empty
There are still signs of civilisation but you could literally spend hours driving into never-ending landscapes and not seeing a single car
There are ghost towns too
Small villages of less than 20 houses all empty
Edit: if you want to live as an hermit there is no way you would be able as said in the comment under mine
As I've said you might be able to live in the Pyrénées with relatively few neighbours or even in a single house in the wilderness
But there's always a road or a nearby village and most of the place is protected (and don't even think about starting a fire)
You can still get lost exploring the mountains
Living like a hermit is practically impossible
Population density may be a factor but not a final one
Spain is more sparsely populated, especially non-coastal areas except Madrid, but you won't find what OP says unless if you count national parks, *maybe*.
It is indeed empty but completely unsuitable to live as a hermit as OP asked
A lot of it is private farms or hunting grounds so you would be trespassing
Ghost towns are out of the question too because people are fiercely protective of their properties even if it is a pile of rubble nobody has lived in for 80 years
And then there's the national parks, some of which do offer more chances to get lost, but since it is forbidden to camp in them except for very specific areas --and unless you find a spot that is far enough from walking trails-- it is quite likely you would be discovered and arrested in a short time
I clearly missed the part of living as an hermit
There is no way it could work
I've seen a few houses in the Pyrénées but that's as close as you can get
You can live as an hermit
There's still some cenobium here and there and I know positively that there are hermits in Mallorca (one of them died recently)
What you can't live as is as a squatter
Amazing character
It's not at all
It's about how population density is distributed, not about the total population density
Russia has places meeting OP's scenario not because of its 8 people/km^2 but because it has huge areas that are uninhabitable or with really harsh conditions
There's a self-sustained little town in the middle of the Sierra de Ayllón, it's called "Fraguas". It occupies a town previously destroyed by Franco forces for use as a training / target practice area
I've visited and it's pretty cool, they've reconstructed some of the houses and built new ones, they have crops and solar panels, and even a beer factory
They are being prosecuted since it's a protected area but it's just an area where autoctonous oak trees were replaced with pine for lumber
They've been replanting oak and don't do much ecological damage
They even have a reinforced house to offer resistance if they try to forcefully evict them
I think it's a pretty cool effort and it's the closest to living as a hermit I could come up with
Yeah you totally can, there is a [webpage] where you can buy entire abandoned villages and stuff
There are some stories going around about some friends and their families buying a ghost town, rebuilding it and living there from the agriculture and livestock
I didn't consider the possibility of having enough money for that, given that OP mentioned bushmen
I mean, buying a full town ain't cheap, even completely abandoned and ruined ones (nobody gives up a property for nothing in this country, even if it is an unsellable toxic dump)
But I guess being loaded and living like a hermit are not incompatible things
I'm completely unable to find the news article in English because these are usually regional news and I only know a few cases within Catalunya (which is already a small sample, and the news are in catalan)
I found two examples:
-A town called Esblada, they almost bought the town but had some problems with the bank the day before buying it
This is what I was refering to, I thought they made it in the end but I was wrong
They had a really ambitious project though
-Another town called Solanell, which is being bought and reconstructed slowly as they have to contact every owner of every house to buy them and reconstruct them
These project had to bring water and electricity there too but it is going fairly well
They have built an inn and they intend to give each house to every person in the cooperative that is buying the town so there won't be any speculation going on
In fact the people in the cooperative seem to already have some connection with the town (the town they where born in etc
[This article] explains it fairly well but I cannot find anything in english
It's in Catalan so you may be able to translate it using google translate
You could probably buy a single dilapidated house for less than 10k. Keep in mind on that price range you would most likely have to tear it down and build a new one, so you would need to add the cost of the construction
Also, it is quite likely you would not have access to modern utilities (water, electricity, internet) so that's even more extra expenses to make it livable
All in all it is probably much easier and cheaper to buy a house or a farm in a very small but still inhabited town
Our previous head of state, King Juan Carlos I, was born in Rome
It depends on the country
But our head of state, our king, has more foreign than Spanish blood, his father's family was French and his mother's Greek
No one would care
P.S: Except the republicans
In Spain the press has been sinking for a while, and the last right-wing government pretty much put the last nail in the coffin, as President Rajoy basically refused to be accountable and answered only the questions he liked (à la Trump)
El País was and still is the most important journal, but its credibility is nowhere near where it was
Nobody expects them to be really critical of politicians or the government because, well, they haven't.
I would say the closest answer to your question would be El Jueves (the Thursday)
Let me elaborate
This is a satirical magazine similar to Charlie Hebdo, published on Wednesdays by the way, were they draw cartoons of politicians and make fun of them
Seems innocent enough, but you can't imagine the shitstorms we get whenever they publish a cover with the royal family on it
They did the crown prince doing her wife doggystyle, both naked; they did the former king passing down a huge turd to his son (at the time of the real life coronation), etc
They may not ever cause the fall down of a politician, but the magazine really shows you how much hidden power the crown still holds and how large is the divide between them and the rest of society,and they got into trouble for it
The editor basically fired most of those working on it and they had to buy the rights and start their own business (as fr as I remember, it was a while ago)
I hope this sufficiently answers the question  if I have the time I'll post another example from TV later, as a reply
Cheers
Let's say that the 2 most important newspapers in spain ABC and El Pais are more comprehensive with the right than with the left
None, TV is fully bought by the leftists (the government even gave them 15 million € 10 days ago), and most newspapers are bought as well
The third paper of record El Mundo is somewhat right-tending though
ABC I think can go either way but is right-ish in the economics portal while El País is somewhat left-tending
^Also ^happy ^cake ^day
We have eldiario
es that is clearly left-wing, they were the ones that discovered the corruption with the master's degrees, etc
that lead to the resignation of Cifuentes
It's just an electronic paper, but it counts
Since when El Pais is a right wing newspaper
Another matter is when PRISA group didn't save PSOE's image back then, but they have never supported the right either
Having said that, nowadays the main left media group in Spain is Mediapro (LaSexta etc
Las entrevistas de Risto Mejide son ejemplos buenísimos de la inclinación de las periodistas y los medios de comunicación en España.
Es una vergüenza el socialismo en España.
Hombre inda que esta todo el dia ahi de izquierdas no es
Sorry but La Sexta belongs to A3Media, not Mediapro
They are not a left channel the same way Mediapro isn't a left media group
Some of the journalist you may know working there, yeah they are very lefties
We don't really have long time alliances but the Irish people and us always supported each other AFAIK
They're the only guys in Europe who didn't have a war with as in countries fighting
Germany, never fought against us alone, has fought on our side a ton of times, and against us only twice as part as a coalition
Which is a lot considering we have fought France, the UK and the Netherlands in more than 15 wars each
Last time we helped Germany it was in WW2, luckily for us we just had finished our civil war so the country was destroyed and we couldn't get in the war with full support, only volunteers went to fight for Germany, 47
000 volunteers to be exact
Some of them to restore their honor (kind of), some for money and some to fight communism
Not Lithuania
> Cant answer for us, because obvious
Not to me
Could you say who it is and why
Probably because they didn't even exist as a country haha
It never was a *soverign* country, that's what I meant
therefore they didn't have a say of who they would go to war with or support them or whatever
Yes, lots
To my despair
Lately the predominant one has the word STAFF
Staff for who
The President
The Mayor
All of us
I will have a beer here, in the subway

He means that that's the number written on Roman numbers
Usually light-hearted and meant to make people feel good, but I think it's common to be sarcastic too
The most common jokes are dialogue-based ones that take a paragraph of storytelling to get to the punchline
You see this often in Whatsapp chain messages but also in person
Spanish humour is only politically correct these days
You are supposed to punch up
It's just disgusting, you can't make a joke about anything in public for fear of offending someone

One of the vets of my dogs is from Croatia
He is fluent in Spanish and he's got the darkest sense of humour I have seen in ages
I had a dog who had some kind of tumor in her tail, so this vet had to cut off the tail
My dog slept that night at the clinic, she was old and needed constant care
So next day I go to pick her, it was a Friday
I ask the vet, "Do you think we can have a barbacue at home on Sunday
" meaning would my dog be OK even if the house is fulll of people
He answered, "I am so sorry, but her tail is already in the biological hazardous waste bin".
I really love your input, thank you
Aka El pana Juan
Not from Europe, but this one's a classic
[Japanese politician passionate apology]
Not so bad but a few weeks ago the president of the Community of Madrid freak out in an interview
She has been determined to build a hospital in record time (Madrid can't be less than China) and the interviewer asked her how many health care workers they were going to hire for the new hospital
The president slipped up to say that they were going to take doctors away from hospitals already in operation and bring them to the new hospital instead of hiring new ones
The interviewer, very surprised, asks her if she has understood correctly and they are going to take doctors from the hospitals that are already at the limit of their possibilities because of the Covid, and that is when the president realizes that she has screwed up and everything goes to hell
She takes her hands to her ears as if she wanted to be swallowed by the earth, starts moving nervously, repeat the same things over and over again and concludes proclaiming categorically "you don't ask a president things like that".
The hospital is already open and, yes, they have taken doctors from other hospitals, cost overrun of 46 million euros (97 million instead of 52 million) and on top of that it is unfinished, its basically a [very large industrial building with beds] no privacy for patients and no operating rooms
Here is an illustrative [picture] of the peak moment and, if you are interested in practicing Spanish, [here is the video]
God, that WAS cringe
Poor old man, he just couldn't hear anything :(
There's also Andrea Levy in that videocall at the Asamblea de Madrid
I think she must have been drunk:
why Madrid
why did you do that
Murcia doesn’t exist (:
The "Worldmap" of Bilbao
Miquel Montoro
If you are Spanish you know who this kid is
if you don’t prepare for the best time of your life
Wait I've seen the guy on TV, when he played for Real Madrid
Has he been put down
[Jordi Hurtado] is an immortal being that hasn't changed a bit since the dawn of time
In Catalonia we have the same running joke, but Andorra declares war against Catalonia, we surrender and become independent

Neither does Teruel, it's suspicious that they insist that much on it by making a fucking politic party called Teruel Existe, or Teruel exists
Se vende Ford fiesta del 2009 que folla solo

Well, they are in the government now so they may exist
But I don’t see Murcia in the government
"Mapamundi de Bilbao", showing the world as Bilbao's centered surroundings
It's an inside joke about  the alleged basque's tendency for exaggeration
So why the hell did she end up as the president of the European Comission
Maybe he homeschooled them

Explain it to me please
Pues eso
Yes, I do
Mostly Ireland's because I have a personal interest on it, I am going to move there in a few years
Besides Ireland, I get informed a bit on what is happening on big and influential countries (US, France, etc
I also keep an eye on EU news
Not always, only when there is something to pay attention
For example, never put an eye on Azerbaijan until the last months
Yes
And actually the CDU event has been one of the major political news of the day here
Honestly, not really
I only follow US politics a bit when there's elections, and I used to follow UK politics during Brexit
I think we have enough shit on our plate, yet I put even more
When I had decided that I was not going to stay in Spain -  mainly due to the laboral market situation - I started to think what country I would like to live in when I finish my career
I got informed about a lot of countries (France, Netherlands, UK
) and I really liked Ireland
As much as one can learn of a country and its people from the outside, I loved it
A great plus is that I already speak the language
So that makes it easier to - apart from moving to the country without needing to learn a new language - to interact with Irish people through Internet (for example through Ireland's subreddit) and therefore being able to experience some degree of *Irishness* even before I move there
Also, I think that - even within our differences - we Spaniards and Irish are somewhat similar
There are all kinds of Irish and Spanish people, of course, but we both are known internationally for being very friendly people and for knowing how to have a great deal of craic
My impression has been overall great
The thing that I am most *upset* - to say it boldly - about is how the housing crisis is being dealed with
I do not know if I have the right or am sufficiently informed to give my opinion about it as someone who has not experienced it in first person, but I think that more can be done to improve the situation
Either Cork or Limerick, probably
I not that much into politics as to have an opinion made of the different political parties
I started to keep an eye on Irish news 6 months ago
I only know the party who's been in power since the last year's election
And I think they are doing well
To be honest, I am not a politics person
I am not even much into Spanish politics neither
I know the basics of every political party to be able to understand what's happening and that's all
Murcia
You never know what sort of crazy things they're up to down there, and there's no witnesses to tell it
On a more serious note, in any run down district of any big city there are sketchy parts
You've got some "poblados" (settlements) that are close to be slums where there is a heavy drug trafficking problem
Then there are parts of Spain completely empty where villages and towns, although they appear on the map, they've been abandoned for decades and there's no one left except for some old people
Some people with issues live isolated and can be scary if encountered alone
Like, conspiranoid survival prepper stalker kind, I've met a couple and they are the type of people that would shoot a couple of campers
Belchite, it's a village where in the Spanish Civil War, got destroyed, about 5000 died in the village, today it was rebuilt but some metres away there is still the old destroyed village

We all love Murcia, those are just our running gags
I understand the Murcianos who are fed up, though
very popular
most kids in rural and suburban areas drink by the age of 15
Unfortunately common and becoming a serious problem
I wonder how many more 14 year-olds in a comma we need to collectively wake up
About the same thing that you said
Most people start at around 16 in my experience, getting their drinks from the guy that looks the oldest in the group
I wonder, how popular are “botellones” these days
Are they still a thing, or have police curbed them
63 different parties received votes during the 2019 general elections
Of which 16 managed to get representatives in the Congreso de los diputados
Most are regionalist parties, others are historical parties that no longer have that much power
The rest is probably parties with a very specific interest like maybe PACMA which fights for animal rights, so this kind of parties don't usually get representation because bigger parties already have policies regarding those topics
Here we have 5 important national parties and a lot of more local parties
the "main" parties went from 2 in the 2000's to 5 in the 2010's
i think thats a good thing, more alternatives and more parties to represent people's ideas
but on the other hand our voting system benefits the bigger parties, and punishes the small ones, specially if they are spread out throughout the country
So theres a tendency to do "useful vote" and vote for the big party instead of the one that actually aligns with you
Adding to this, the main parties (from right to left Vox, PP, PSOE and Podemos; "far" right, right, left "far" left respectively) shit a lot on each other but they act very similarly and it doesn't feel like there's a choice, specially for the left
Demonstrated corruption in the main 2 parties (PSOE and PP) doesn't really help with the apathy voters feel
Edit: now that I remember, there has also been a bunch of proven corruption cases in Vox, the worst one was about a marxist party in Iran helping fund their campaign in the Andalusian local elections (because fuck ideals, the far left funding foreign reactionaries)
Podemos has now an ongoing investigation, but since this is not the first time they're accused of something and all cases have been dropped because there was 0 evidence, it's safe to say that the accusers pulled it out of their ass
We'll see if it's true
I think it's very funny that Cs didn't even make it on that list
Which is obvious
But still funny
Albert deserved it
You can't just create a """centrist""" party exclusively to shit on Catalonia and expect the voters to not realize
"""Socialdemocrats""", lol
Liberals are annoying
Vox is exactly like the Republican party on social issues (minimal gun control, Christian values, anti-immigration rhethoric), but economically I feel like they're slightly corporatist (fascist) instead of capitalist
The Popular Party (PP) is socially conservative, but not as much as the Republican party, and they're also capitalists
I'd say they're slightly further right than the Democrats
They're the main right-wing party
The Socialist Party or Spanish Socialist Worker's Party (PSOE) is economically slightly leftist, but still capitalist
They're somewhere in between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but they swing around right and left
They're the historical left-wing party and they used to be marxist until right after they won their first election in the 80s. It would have been very awkward to have Central Europe surrounded by socialist republics lol
They're also socially progressive, like the democrats
Podemos used to be anti-capitalist a few years ago, now it's what would happen if Bernie Sanders founded a party but was a coward and didn't actually get anything done
They're as socially progressive as the Socialist Party, and their ideology is generally "extremist" socialdemocracy and eurocommunism (which practically functions like socialdemocracy)
Their talking points are tangently marxist, but their policies are only marginally more left-wing than those of the Socialist Party
Right now the government is composed of a Socialist Party president and 2 vice presidents, and a vice president from Podemos
Most of the ministers are from the Socialist Party except for 2 or 3 from the Communist Party, which isn't actually communist and it's also in Podemos
I would say that the Republicans have an obvious equivalent here, Vox, but the Democrats are harder to "translate". I guess they'd be considered centrists, between the PP and the PSOE
They are economically very close to the PP but socially they'd share most opinions with the Socialist Party
I live in an area of Madrid with pretty much exclusively small hole in the wall restaurants and bars owned by immigrants
Lately I have been eating out, or getting take away a lot more- nearly every day of the week, partially because I’ve been extremely busy but also because I know a lot of these places are suffering these days
The people over at r/personalfinance would probably chew me out for eating out so much, but I am happy to support the little holes in the wall that are going through tough times
I’ve quickly become on personal terms with the staff at 4-5 places near my house, and I tip as often as I can
I travel a lot (not so much lately), and one waitress, when asking me about a recent trip, asked me if I could bring her a fridge magnet the next time I go somewhere- so now it’s become a regular thing and I’ve brought her 4 or 5 fridge magnets from all around Europe
Warms my heart to interact on a personal level with local businesses
I'm still a member of the mountain and climbing club of my hometown even though nowadays I mostly go on my own means and material and less often
I've never suspended my membership to my scout's group even when I couldn't attend
Same goes to my town's musical society, I will always pay membership even if I'm not currently playing in the band
I always pay the union monthly fee
My union does not receive funding from the state and mutual aid between workers is essential
They saved my skin, I'll save anyone's.

Hello, Spanish Ornitological Society donor here
What you are doing is very cute
Madrileño(a) ;) .. in my neighborhood, a lot of South Americans- mainly Colombians, Peruvians, and Ecuadorians
But all around the city you’ll find people from most parts of the world
There are neighborhoods with high Chinese populations, in fact they own most of the small convenience stores here, to the point where the colloquial term for that type of store is a ‘Chino’ (not here to debate the rights and wrongs of that), there areas with lots of Indians, various African nationalities
depending on where you are, Madrid can be quite multi cultural
Depending on how blunt you want to put it:
Venga vale
Bueeeeno
(Ya) Está bien
¡Suficiente
¡Hasta aquí (hemos llegado)
It would be "Buen punto" which literally translates to Good point, but it's mostly used as fair enough
I feel like those examples are kind of passive-aggressive
"Fair enough" is like "yeah i guess you have a point". *Venga vale* and *Está bien* are the most accurate, but the others are a bit mad and exasperated
The tone does most of it though, you're right on that
The expression I would most likely use would be *También es verdad*, which translates to "(i guess) that's right".
I'm going with "no te falta razón" (You don't lack a point)
I joke with a friend of mine that it's *justo justo*
There's indeed no literal translation because that would be "suficientemente justo" and nobody says that
But there's definitely ways to express that feeling of "okay okay let's go on" or "yeah okay I don't agree but okay".
Vale would work too, but I feel like it's a pretty neutral word, and it's mostly the tone that you use that can paint it differently
That's why I wanted to give more examples
That's the thing about language though
Every language can express everything
Just not necessarily as easily or with the same tools
Si tiramos de dichos (sayings), me quedo con: Para ti la perra gorda
Man, I use también es verdad constantly
Yeah, it's hard to come up with the expressions we use all the time right
Kinda weird
Probably when one person is trying to convince you about something and you just tell him "okay, whatever, you won, I dont want to argue more".
2 names max (unless you are from the monarchy) and 2 family names the first family name if your father and the first family name of your mother (or viceversa)
Women do not change their family names when they marry
&#x200B;
If you do not have the spanish nationality you are allowed to give your baby all the names your country allows (but if that baby later get the spanish nationality he would lose all the extra names)
Spanish names:
First name + A middle name if you get one + Father's surname + Mother's surname
The women get to keep their surnames, AND recently it became legal to have the mother's name as the first surname
In Spain, people have a first name, an optional middle name and two last names
The first last name is the father's, and the second is the mother's. Middle names often come before the first name, it really just depends on which you get called, which one is shorter or more recognisable
For example, my dad's name is Joaquín Silverio
Everyone calls him Silverio (or Silver, for short), and that's probably because both his dad and grandad were also named Joaquín. It was just easier to know who they're talking about if they called him Silverio
There are also a ton of two-word names
If someone's name is José Antonio, you can't really call them José nor Antonio (even if those two are names separately)
It's just José Antonio
Both goes for José María (male name) and María José (female name
Two incredibly common two-word names over here
You can basically put José, María or "del Carmen" around any name and it probably exists lol
As a fun fact, my name is Alba, vanilla Alba, and I know a girl named Alba María del Carmen
It's just how it goes
* One or two first names
* First surname (inherited from the first surname of the father)
* Second surname (inherited from the first surname of the mother)
Nothing to do with the monarchy the thing with the string of names
They have the ordinary one or two given names, as they should appear on the civil registry
The string of names are baptismal names, only appearing on church records
My mom have 3 names and they re shown in all their official documents
The thing is that she hates her first name and she has tried to remover it several times and has not been allowed to do it
Technically we have a list of surnames dating back to the invention of surnames since your first surname is the first surname of your dad, the second is the first of your mum, your third is the second of your dad, the fourth is the second of your mum and so on
I was born in Belgium and I got the 2 surnames of my dad xd, had to change it some years ago so I had my moms
That's really interesting
So the father's name is put after Mariya, in a female form
So if Mariya was a guy, it'd be "Mariya Petro Moroz"? There's probably a suffix for males, would it maybe be " Mariya Petrovich Moroz"? I'm really only guessing
and Picasso full name was  "Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso"
But law was changed (early 80s if I remember correctly) and you can't do that anymore
Is not a middle name exactly, but a composed name: Jose Antonio, my name, is composed by the names Jose and Antonio
The problem is that there are many situations in which a form is not filled out, but the ID card is used or it is mandatory that the data you provide matches the data on the card
For example, when we go to the hospital we use a card, she once missed her turn to visit a specialist because when they called her in the waiting room they used her first name, and she didn't realize they were calling her
She has tried to change it, but the civil registry will not allow her to do so because it is considered to be an insignificant change that can harm others
Bureaucracy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Would love to adopt that system
Blew my mind more than it should've lol, thanks for explaining
Legal Name: Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso
Baptismal name:Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Crispiniano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso
Here is the baptismal certificate at least a photo
I have not found the other one, but this is an "official" source
I would have died about 17 times so far
Married to a Navy soldier/officer (depending on my skill) and tending to the kids and the farm
It's basically what every woman in my family did until 1950
Either tiling the fields or killing/dying in the very bloody south American independence war in the name of the worst king Spain ever had
Probs just a fisherman in the Mediterranean with some downlived aspirations of becoming a pirate with my own Buckaneer
Assuming I've survived the Henoch–Schönlein purpura in my childhood (which would were recently described, in 1802), due to my family name ("de Vega") and for as long as I know, I would had lived in Madrid
Which due to my age, I probably would had participated in the Dos de Mayo uprising in 1808 (with no doubt) and eventually would participated in Peninsular War (or Guerra de Independencia Española)
Assuming I had survived both Dos de Mayo uprising and Peninsular War, and due my family history, I'd probably try to live as a painter reflecting scenes from war
Due to the restoration of absolutism in 1814, the feeling of the upcoming hispanoamerican independence uprisings, and unknowing the upcoming restoration of Spanish Constitution of 1812 in 1820, I would probably tried to move to Puerto Rico or Cuba
Caribbean sea always called my attention
Probably a priest or farmer who died fighting in the independence war
I would have died at birth (they had to do an emergency c section to save me)
If somehow I'd survive that, I would have died for sure at 8 months old when I had pneumonia
In my case, I would have been dead by the age of 3
A nasty case of a flu
How come
Don't want to ruin your day, but surviving seven childbirths
That sounds unlikely
I get sick all the time
I am literally typing this while waiting for my turn at the clinic
Yeah, he didn't earned the nickname "the criminal" for nothing
Lol
Get well, fellow stranger
Don't forget famine and epidemics were widespread during that time due to bad harvests and the Napoleonic wars so I'm afraid you'd be very dead
Thank you
Liberal democracies should back each other, especially when their freedom it's under threat by an undemocratic and powerful regime
Having lived in Taiwan, I can only but support their fight to have the right to be out of the shadow of China
Absolutely
I think the EU as a whole should recognize the ROC
That Taiwan is not China we all know that, we're just afraid of the response from the PRC, which is a stupid reasoning not to support a legitimate demcratic State
Taiwan has a legitimate democracy and other western democracies should indeed be siding with them instead of with PRC (by siding, I mean recognizing its independence and making the international relations that already exist with the country be official, not siding with Taiwan on the pretension that the whole continental China belongs to the government of the POC lol)
Well as Taiwan is actually democratic why i wouldnt support it, that kind of agrements benefitiate both so no problems
Yes
I hope the EU and its member state would stand against China and in favor of Taiwan self determination
There was this hope that as China get richer it would embrace democracy, but it's clearly not happening, and it's now a modern imperial power with aggressive regional ambition
We should stand with Taiwan, and support other liberal democracies
Those saying they fear offending Chine realize the more you give to China, the more power they have over you
Import substitution is a joke of a policy, look at Argentina if you want to know where that gets you
We should try to stop Chinese IP theft and currency manipulation, but ignoring comparative advantage and going backwards from a service, information and highly specialised manufacturing economy towards one of low skill mass production is a moronic populist move that would just cause poverty
I agree
Taiwan's stance on One-China policy is very complex, really
Whereas Mainland is pretty clear on the issue, Taiwan isn't so much, and every political party has its own view
All of my Taiwanese friends (they are all in the age between 20-25) have told me they don't believe in One-China, the don't even approve being called Chinese and prefer to be called Taiwanese, and they think international recognition won't ever come from holding such a policy
On the other hand, China won't negotiate unless all parties come into the debate agreeing that unification of some sort is the way to go
So yeah, the majority of Taiwan would need to unite in holding one view in orther for the western countries in the EU and America to even think about Taiwan's recognition
And that view has to be precisely that of seeking out recognition, which probably will come sooner or later (as it's the trend amongst youger voters)
Maybe they need to keep their political independence and form a some kind of Asian Union where Taiwan and PRC can co-exist with freedom of movement for their citizens
That would definitely be the ideal outcome
Edit: i just don't know whether Taiwan or China would be down for it
Definitely seems more like an option China would like rather than Taiwan's favorite
It's similar to the Hong Kong case
Here the name isn't Santa Claus, it's Papá Noel but he is good ole Saint Nick
What I hear the most is that he lives in the North Pole
Bonus Fact: Christmas is just for children, but on Epiphany (Jan 6th) is when you get big presents like a bike, or in my case it was a PS3 back in 2009
It's said that they're brought by the Three Wise Kings
Punch his beard off
Maybe Santa has an apartment in Torremolinos, who knows
Well, they think the same about Spain
They get surprised there's snow and all
Even in the south some regions are quite cold in winter with below zero
It isn't a documentary, but [Tom Scott has a 3 minute video about it]
The Spanish army built a submarine that cannot float
100% quality
Don’t get me wrong, if the requirements were something to be down the sea, they nailed it but I don’t know if that is really functional if there are going to be soldiers inside :)
My uni still has some computers with XP
Technically, it floated, but once submerged, there was no certainty it would float back
From 440M per boat to 550M after being realistic, and then 1000M per boat
Great:
Also don’t forget the time when FNMT (the entity that prints money on Spain) tried to have their SSL certificates accepted by Firefox
It took them nearly a decade
r/DataHoarder added an extra zero
Wait, floppy disks
My uni still has XP running older emulations of windows
Mine has a humongous windows 10 gaming laptop (the best at the time) hooked to the bloody radiology machines
Windows 7 is quality
Windows XP is almost the same on functionality, but has an interface that makes everything so much difficult
I forts read it the other way and thought that helicopters not shooting at tanks not flying was OK
Reality hit me a bit late
It’s Spain
If he is friend of, family of someone important I’m pretty sure he did not get fired
A billion actually, and now it works
Hahhah, it must have been crowded to use
On computer science, actually
Many programs are fucking relics, so they only work in older systems (I especially remember one that was discontinued on 2010)
Half life came out 8 years ago
You can play anything on that laptop
The word "sobremesa". It is when you have already finished your meal but you are still sitting at the table talking with your companions
It is common to do that in Spain, so a perfect translation in English will come handy if it were
Does “trivial” fit into that same meaning
In spanish there's the word 'modorra' for that
I think it might be used in other similar contexts but mainly for that
>it's funny that in Spain you hang out with friends after eating, in Germany we just have dessert
The sobremesa is after the dessert, it's just staying at the table talking when you are finished eating (it's not going to another place)
>Be the change you want to see
Just don't follow me
None in particular but I honestly hate what regional governments of our eastern mediterranean regions have allowed in their coasts
You have entire sections of the mediterranean from barcelona downwards looking like this (  )
Just blocks and blocks of ugly samey looking houses
They just rode the wave of tourism and made it bigger with cheap architecture, making so many beautiful cities uglier
It's worse in the big cities' suburbs IMO
If I remember that building correctly, it's not ugly per se, it's just totally out of place in the Parisian landscape
I wouldn't call it ugly, rather Cyberpunk-y
After seein the monster citties that surround our bigger towns i'd say they are as ugly
Tbh not all the mediterranean is like that
The balearic islands are a paradise (if you ever want to go)
And also the northern coast is nothing like that and the andalucian coast has managed it way better
Yes, sadly
At least it's optional, but, at least during primary (primaria) we have the option to chose either religion or well anything else
I remember asking my teacher, when I was 8 yo, "If god created the earth, who created the rest of the planets"
She had no answer lol
We got that same scam in Spain as well through Francisco Franco
Apart from what you explained related to education, the catholic institutions don't pay taxes at all (even if they are a private university or other business making profit) and they can register any property under their name, stealing hundreds of historic buildings
tell him that in germany you cant say you dont like germany because there is no free speech
Link to the snickers story
We apparently stare as well
Barcelona: second most populated city, great industrial and tech hub, history deeply related to Spain's struggles, and it would ruffle the feathers of both Spanish and Catalan nationalists, which is always a plus
I don't think I'd move it
Madrid is the closest one to the center of the country and all the highways are already designed that way
Oviedo was once the capital city of a little kingdom that ended conquering first the Iberian Peninsula and then half of the world
It would be a good option
Barcelona would not be an option for most Spaniards due to political and historical reasons
It would make way more sense Sevilla, Valladolid, León, Santiago de Compostela, Zaragoza or even Valencia if you were going for something different to the obvious alternative to Madrid that is Toledo
>and it would ruffle the feathers of both Spanish and Catalan nationalists, which is always a plus
You have my support
The capital of Spain should switch every certain years
The country is so diverse and centrifugal, that every region should take the lead and responsibility from time to time, stopping the foolish and poisonous Capital versus Provinces dynamic
Toledo would definitely be better than Barcelona
Barcelona is a bad option due to geography
Capitals work better when they are in the center of the country, making everything more connected
Not toledo :( its too beautiful to move big offices and banks there
In the center like Brasilia, Madrid, Riga, Minsk, Brussels, Ciudad de México, Santiago de Chile, Bogotá, San José, Dodoma, Abuya, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kiev, Tirana, Ankara, Bagdad, Adis Abeba, Norsultan (Astana)
Yeah, because it's quite convininent for the country as a whole that the capital is located in the center
Specially in the past, when traveling was not as easy as today
I still think Strasbourg should be the capital, as it was originally planned
It already holds a good chunk of the EU's institutions (including the European Parliament), it has the whole symbolism about Franco-German relations, and it's way more pretty than Brussels
It's the historical reason why some countries have their capital in the center
We are the least or one of the least important countries
Weak economy, high unemployment, tourism dependant, people only comes here to get drunk and sunburnt for cheap, we are the trashcan of Europe
And when we need help, European tax havens complain
I'd say a great place for tourism (@Germany, UK), inversions and retirement, as well as food and overall gastronomy, culture (ole mi flamenco), and also a great place for food (mainly fruits and vegetables) and labourer exportation
We are also a decent economy and a potential place for maritime trade
&#x200B;
p.s it'd be a great plot twist if this was made as an exam on whether we should be expeled from the EU
To be honest I'm hoping for the greek philosophy to make a comeback
Man it'd be awesome
What we definitely do not need is entitled politicians
We still got our fair share even after the UK left
Hey, we appreciate you by how you are, not by who you are
You're alone at imperialistic politics in europe too
I searched it a few days ago, only about 20% of your population wanted to join the EU
May I ask what do you think that's the main reason of this
I feel like this is the best possible answer to this question
Without the EU none of these countries would have enough power to affect world politics and economics at the level we do now
I see people complaining about their country being a big contributor to the EU, but most of them are from small countries that wouldn't stand a chance against bigger nations if it wasn't for the EU
Unity is strength
We’re also a huge food and wine producer
Don’t underestimate the value in that respect
And while a large part of the economy is tourism based, hopefully the pandemic will start to shift that into more sustainable industries
Personally, I’d like to see a big push into renewable energy for export - not just energy production but factories building equipment for renewable energy production
Like Spain, we're so similar, the peninsular brothers
Yeah and india have a bigger economy than the UK and that doesnt mean anything
For a 50M population country we're as relevant as a 10M country
Really
With 20-25% of unemployment, seasonal and low quality jobs related to tourism and now with the covid that caused a lack of tourism and businesses closing en masse we are the 4th strongest economy
Yeah, we export more then the 50% of our food production and farmers can't cover the expenses most of the times, climate change will make water a valuable resource so we (and Europe) will be fucked when that starts to fail too
And some years ago Malaga had the biggest production of solar panels, and almost all industries closed because it was not sustainable because China produced more and cheaper
It's "rebirthing" now, but idk, China beat us once it will probably do it twice
Money causes the long term memory to not work
So it's impossible to learn from our failures (or at least for the people in charge)
It's a aytonomous territory from the Kingdom of Denmark
Do you think it's unlikely for y'all to join us in the future
It’s also disappointing that desalination plants are not a bigger thing here
Yeah, desalination plants are like batteries and grafene, they are always announcing great advances and applications but they never materialize
Some years ago I saw a documentary about a process for desalination plants that cut the costs of producing water greatly (like a 80% or 90%) yet it seems nobody thought about actually doing it
Droughts are common in Spain and every year are longer, idk what are we waiting for to invest I+D+I for desalination plants (probably when we empty the natural aquifers and is too late)
I think some of the population would be against it if they actually tried to use it
Look at the Canary Islands, everybody hates tap water there, even though it's what makes the islands able to sustain their population and produce food
It won't happen until the droughts become too bad to reject it
The only downside I see are waiting times (when it comes to surgeries)
You can be waiting for weeks or months if it is something that can wait
But it is just because they usually give priority to severe diseases
If it is something severe, for example appendicitis, they get you to surgery at the moment
So that's fine by me
My sister had cancer (osteosarcoma with metastasis in the lungs), and they treated her (surgeries and chemotherapy) immediately when they knew what she had
When it comes to appointments with your assigned doctor (we call it "médico de familia; family's doctor), you do not have to wait much, a day or a couple; a week at maximum, from my experience
But if it is something that cannot wait (or you just simply want it seen immediately), you can go to Emergencies and they'll treat you there (a lot of people do that)
The only thing that can happen if you go to Emergencies for something that is not an emergency is that they will tell you "Do you know that this is not an emergency, right
Next time get an appointment, now sit there and wait to your turn".
Slightly higher taxes, and, overall longer waiting queues
I'd rather that 1000000 times over having to sell my house to pay the bills though
I've lived in two countries with free healthcare but different culture/ level of service
To me, one of the downsides can be that people take it for "granted" and will go to the doctor for absolutely everything: colds, flu,  throat hurts, because it's been too long without a blood test and want to check everything is OK
don't get me wrong I wouldn't change free healthcare for anything and things can get picked up faster and easily if everybody goes to the doctor soon but it's not going to be sustainable long term if people keeps behaving like this
There's a level of entitlement of "doctors have to do better"; they just don't realise how lucky they are - many people don't even know you need to pay for healthcare in other countries
I've got a friend that is a doctor and she has avoided her sister taking her nephew to the doctor at least 15 times for very minor completely normal illnesses
Is not really free, I mean
I can go to the hospital or my PG and I will not receive a bill to pay, but it's paid by everyone through taxes, like education, roads, etc
That's what taxes are for
In Spain
Long waiting times to a doctor that seems not to care about you and seems to want to get you out of his office as fast as possible
It's not uncommon to wait a month for a doctor which will tell you to do a test in a month, a month afterwards you'll discuss the results and repeat
I went both through public and private healthcare, and what took the public sector approximately 5 months to do, the private doctor needed a day and 80 bucks
Granted, it wasn't urgent, but still
Depends on the healthcare system tbh
I feel like having some sort of public healthcare is always beter than not, but there's downsides to this
Public administrations are notably inefficient, that's why some countries have alternative systems, like private, non for profit hospitals with public insurance, or "guaranteed insurance" (i.e. you have to get your own insurance but if you can't, the government will fund it)
Waiting times can be long for some things, which sucks, but they try to prioritize important things
Another big advantage of having a public system is that private insurance has to compete with this public system, so they have to keep prices reasonable
All have some upsides and downsides, but I don't really see the upside of purely private healthcare systems
Honestly I struggled to see any
Yes you pay for it in taxes, but in exchange you and everyone you know (who lives here) has access to healthcare for free at the point of use
In Spain you may have to wait, but you can have a really affordable private insurance (like 50 euros/month) and get access to private healthcare network as well
Could people cut the "iT's NoT fReE iT's TaX pAyEd" bullshit
Do you even say "iT's NoT fReE iT's  pAyEd By ThE oWnEr WhO tAkEs MoNeY fRoM cUsToMeRs" when you are given free stuff
>But if it is something that cannot wait (or you just simply want it seen immediately), you can go to Emergencies and they'll treat you there (a lot of people do that)
That's the reason they are always full because people go for some shit that isn't an emergency
I think it's also important to point out that, besides the public healthcare system, there are private hospitals and clinics too, in case someone is in a hurry for something non urgent, or if they prefer to have a fancier hospital room
This private healthcare network is of course cheaper than in other countries where they don't compete with a public network
You couldn't be more clueless
Until you actually got sick and have to pay 300k for 3 nights in the hospital
Waiting for non severe issues does not make sense in a private system - ideally you'd be able to have a system that can treat a guy with a bullet in his stomach AND remove your tonsils at the same time
Public systems are slower as the cost of going to the doctor does not directly impact those that do go to the doctor - turns out people just visit the doctor more often if they don't have to pay
Private systems are self regulating in the sense that both people try not to go to the doctor if they feel they don't have to - and as the system gets strained by capacity it expands (as it is then making more money and realizes it would be able to make even more if it expanded)
Personally I'm fine with having mixed systems - a public one for those that need it and can't afford a private one, and private healthcare for those willing to pay more so they don't have to wait
It's like that in most EU countries afaik
I know this isn't universal, but where I live we have a local clinic (centro de salud) for a population of 30k even though there's supposed to be a clinic per 10k people
The autonomous government won't build another one even though the city council has been demmanding one for like 10 years
The regular services of the clinic are completely saturated all the time and if you want an appointment for your general practitioner (médico de familia) you have to wait over a week
If you have something like a bronchitis or a pharingitis you could be cured by that time if you had received treatment, but if you haven't it might get worse
So for things like that everyone in town goes to the emergency services in the same clinic, which funnily enough are never saturated
The doctors know this and accept it because otherwise they wouldn't be able to treat everyone properly
This wasn't always like that, tho
For example when I was a child I could get an appointment for the next day
I went to the practitioner once with a stomach ache thinking it would be gastroenteritis and it turned out to be apendicitis, but it was fine because I only waited a day
I couldn't do that today
I pay like 40 euros/month for private health insurance
I assume an american one is exponentially more expensive and cover way less
Yeah, you are right in that
> was very lucky to be treated immediately
Well, she was treated immediately when they knew what was going on with her
The tumor had a lot of time to develop unnoticed
They had to cut off her arm (the tumor was near the shoulder) and even then they did not know if she was gonna make it
Fortunately, they got her into an experimental treatment and she recovered eventually
She's alright now
> horrified about the low quality of Spanish Healthcare
> clearly sick people waiting for hours without help and oxygen masks in the wait room
I've never seen that in any of the hospitals I've been
The same thing happens in Spain with the PP
They never say it but when they get to power in autonomous regions (since healthcare is decentralised) they start cutting down fund
Once the healthcare services are in shambles they start saying that it's because public healthcare is inefficient, so they start introducing copayments, semi-privatising clinics and hospitals and promoting private healthcare
>it turned out to be apendicitis, but it was fine because I only waited a day
I couldn't do that today
My sister had appendicitis, she waitwd a few hours until going to emergencies, the doctors spent too much time diagnosing her because she had strong gasses along with it and the diagnosis was being meddled, and it almost got mortal, but they manage to operate her in time
I know that it's case by case, but it surprises me that you were able to wait a day, when my sister, had she waited until 19:00 instead of going to the doctor at 17:00, she would've died
> someone comes first no matter what
Only if you don't have a healthcare system with enough capacity - which will always be the case for public systems (the sole fact that you add capacity makes people use healthcare services more often)
In Spain we buy eggs unrefrigerated and then we put them into the fridge at home cause so haha
Some hospitals in Spain have the color code system
Hungarian, no doubt
Have you seen the length of the words
Euskera
From vasque country in spain
No one knows  where that thing comes from, and it's the most difficult thing ever
English
It always bothers me how word pronunciations are more dependent on the word itself than in its letters
The Spanish civil war, the preamble of the WWII, it is very interesting
The Cromwell regime
It's something I know almost nothing about
the idea of the English being in a republic fascinates me
Why is it shameful that I don't know about it
I lived a whole year in Ireland and they have
"pretty strong" views about Cromwell
For a similar reason I'll one day get into the troubles
I'm building up the courage
Don't worry in Spain they don't teach us about the civil war neither
France between Charlemagne and Joan of Arc, and again between the Battle of Pavia and Louis XIV
Just that they were bogged by internal conflicts preventing them from dominating the continent with their population that dwarfed every other country at the time
Also/particularly, what was the deal with the Cathars and later the Huguenots
Sweden's invasion of Poland is another
Well, almost anything Scandinavia, really
The Spanish Civil War, in a few lazy words:
Population votes, Republic wins
We kick the monarchy out of our country
We enjoy a few years of Republic
The military goes "nope, me no likey". They declare a military coup d'etat
The war starts
More than 500,000 people die, many of them were civilians
The Republicans surrender after almost 3 years of hunger, misery and fear
Franco becomes a dictator for 34 f*cking years and imposes monarchy back in our country after his death in 1975
The french politics in the interwar period
Generally the hystory of the balcan zone specially in the midle ages
The history of north europe pre northern war (excluding the 30 years war and how sweden was involve in it)
how was the crisis that lead to the fall of the byzantine empire
&#x200B;
And probably i will say more
I don't have a clue about the Yugoslav Wars, and I even don't know why, because I was quite aware of what was happening in the Gulf War, which was immediately before
Sadly, really is
The 30 years war is pretty interesting but im ashame that i only have some spanish information and almost nothing in english to pass you
The thing is the Spanish civil war was a prelude to the WWII and ended just before the other started so it got quickly forgotten
It goes from 1936 to 1939 and it was the Republican side who were the rightful Spanish government against the insurgents, the so-called National side who were fascists
The Republicans got help from Russia and  communist and socialist volunteers from other countries such as the  USA (the Abraham Lincoln batallion) whereas the Nationals got help from the Nazi Germany
It's very famous the Guernica painting which depicts the bombing of Guernica by the Nazi Condor Legion and it was one of the first aerial bombings, the Nazis used Spain as a testing area
After the war Spain got so devastated that we couldn't participate in WWII (we would have been Nazi allies after Franco's victory) and therefore we didn't partake of the Marshall Plan getting us behind most European countries
Franco's dictatorship lasted until his death in 1975
Yes and when people thing abaut the great war they only have the image of the western front of the Somme, never from the batles of Isonzo the balkan front or the eastern fron wich are in my opinion even more interesting
well not the best source
its like leraning medicine watching a film abaut a doctor
I mean
you're forgiven
The 30 years war was absolute chaos
There's a point when you don't even know which mercenaries are which
It's in the curriculum
yeah this is how a bad teacher will explain this, totally sided for that conflict
The republicans who fought against the fascist in Spain get exiled to France where they joined to fight against Hitler troops and participate actively to liberate Paris, they were the first to enter there and liberate it (this division is called "La novena/La nueve" "The ninth") and this is sad because once the axis lost the war in Europe, this republicans guys hope to end the fascism at all invading Spain with the allies but it never occurred and they live outside Spain all his lives, almost till the death of Franco (1975), it is sad because in France they remember this heroes but in Spain not because the fascist regime basically  wipe out their memories
Spanish civil war is, in my opinion, the saddest thing happened in Spain because today you can hear the echoes and rivalries of the war, it is normal that people, politically talking, argue using the civil war in his arguments
This is a little pill of Spanish and Europe's history, if you are interested you can search about La Novena, very interesting history
Yeah of course, all the important battles and the repercussion in a neutral point of view
also how the nationalist band pass from just wanting to have a republic orientated to the righ wing and ended supporting a dictatorship,
Wich is something most people dont know
there is a film abaut that called "Mientras dure la Guerra" from the perspective of the spanish writer Miguel de Unamuno
Paul Preston is a British historian specialised in the Spanish Civil war, he is regarded as one of the main academic authorities on it, in case you are interested
2 things to mention
The italians where the ones that give even more support than the germans specially in the ground forces the l3/33 was the secon tank more common in the conflict
Second the nationalist wherent fascist at the begining but after the events of the alcazar de Toledo Franco assumes control of the Nationalist side and then yes then they are fascist
It's shameful that I don't know about it
also you have mercenary companies changing sides constantly
i remember a case in wich they promise a mercenary to pay him to change sides only to get time for the coming troops
i would expect that it been related to the 80 years war you will have a better knowledge abaut it
I know i already explained in another reply how its part of the curriculum but how mostly you never reach it, but maybe its just my experience and of those people ive asked
It's just conviniently left to the end of history semester and at least in my experience (and all the people I've asked) you never really get to see it
Usually there's enough time to reach the s. XIX century and that's it, it's really unusual to get to 1936 in class, and if the teacher  somehow manages he is going to be short on time and won't be able to propearly teach it
yes, there are still fight abaut that so most teacher dont teach you abaut it or teach you from the perspective this side good and this side bad
Would you please give us the other side view
All my family was pro-Nationalists yet they are still unable to formulate a decent argument in favor of their position beyond "Republicans were bad people".
yes but as all the sequels is worse than the original
True to both, forgot about the Italians :)
>yes then they are fascist
Fascistoid\*. Franco wasn't an ideologist like JA Primo de Rivera (who also wasn't exactly fascist, but created falangism inspired by fascism) and his mentor Millán Astray, but he found very convenient to steal and distort PdR's image to justify and glorify his personal cult
the thing is that with the policy of giving weapond to the population the anarchist and communist take advantage and start the revolution
in a very sketchy way
yeah when i was doing a work abaut ir you realise that you also have nations lik
greece,portugal,luxemburg, albania,montenegro, greece,japan ...........
> its part of the curriculum but how mostly you never reach it
Exactly my experience
I wanted to kill my history teacher
Same experience
The CV was glossed over because by the time you get to it there are barely any days left in the school year
However, a teacher of mine told me that it can sometimes kind of be done on purpose because people still feel strongly about it and if students went back home and told their parents what they are being taught at school, parents might not be happy about it
In my school there were some grandchildren of people who were involved with the regime to different degrees, or who simply supported it, so the school definitely didn't want to upset them and lose their students/clients
A pronatiolist will mention the asturias rebelion and the thing called red terror to criminalice the other side, specially the argument abaut the "El terror Rojo" in the asturias rebelion to criminalice the other side, also will talk abaut they where supported by Stalin and talk abaut the popular front as almost a pupet of the ussr like if spain has the same status as countries like poland has in the warsaw pact
A objective person will start talking abaut the carlist wars so you have some background
will talk abaut the conflicts of the left and righ then they will proceed to explain how a movement that started wanting a righ wing repulic ended supporting a fascist dictatorship
Although the falange is the fascist party in spain the beginning of the term fascism comes from Musolini wich takes the term from the roman symbol of the Fasces the kind of axe make by a bunch of stacks and a blade wich you can see as symbol of the guardia civil (but for other reasons dont related to fascism)
But honestly that period is very convulse so i prefer to say less then say something wrong
Are you serious
Who started the revolution
Its probably not his fault if its somethibg so systemathic don't blame the teacher
What happened was that there were certain groups that saw war as the means of reaching the revolution and dedicated themselves to this, coming to face each other, the most famous confrontation being that of Barcelona where communist and republican anarchists faced each other
link to the wikipedia page in Spanish
I'm sorry I can't be more precise but with this you should be able to search for the article in English (if there is one) but I prefer to say little than to say something wrong
You're right at pointing that out, but
We finished with the DISASTER OF 98
Everything else was self studied
There IS a systemic problem
However, I believe that as a teacher you can either fight it or let it be
and my history teacher was definetely from the second group
That's not the same that you said in your prior comment, that they started the revolution
I know about the conflicts within the Republican side but they didn't start any revolution in Spain, that was all the "Nationals".
Yes i also noticed you mostly have enough time to reach to the disaster of 98
I don't know how was your teacher, but as in wishing to be in the future a histoey teacher i don't want to blame them for something thwy probably have no control over
lol at least reach the second republic mother of god
I guess its because the most recent topics are still polemic and fresh wounds, they need to be teached but the people who decide what must be teached would prefer to avoid it
maybe i spress myself wrong so im sorry
I hope that whole situation is solved by the time you become a teacher
In fairness it has to be increadibly frustrating not to have enough time
year
After
Year
It must wear you down
I'm just frustrated because
I'm not going to rant about selectividad here, but dear god did I hate the way the exams were made up
I just wished my history teacher had warned us about it the way our literature teacher did
In Spain it depends on the region but where I live classes start at 8:15 am, every hour lasts 55 minutes, there are 6 hours with a 20minute break after every two hours, this is the school day from what would be 7th grade up to 12th
(this was in Spain)
At 8:40 I would meet my friend in front of the school and skip first period to have a cup of coffee with him
After that I would go back and zone out until recess
At recess we would have a beer in the bar beside the school (aptly named "the library") and return to school where I would spend the rest of the day writing short stories in my notebook
I didn't do very well in highschool
Get up at 6:45, wash my face, dress up, take breakfast, go walking to my school, start at 7:55, each class is 55 minutes, we do 2 classes, 25 min break, 2 classes, 20 min break, and 3 or 2 more hours of class, depending on the day
My school days were like this:
Start at 9:00 end at 14:00
30 Minute break at 12:00 for breakfast
5 different classes each day
the first 2 last for one hour, the rest 50 minutes
No breaks between lessons
School starts around 8:30 (mine started at 8:40)
Class lasts 50 minutes with 5 minute pause for teachers and students to go to class and the toilet .
At 11
20 there's a 30 minute break for snacks
School finishes at 14
30 and you have lunch then
&#x200B;
In primary school, in my catholic school we had class from 9 to 13
30, we had lunch at home or at school in the cantine, and we went back at 15
30 to 17
I think now, at least my old school changed it so that all the class is in the morning
I had 1-hour classes divided in two parts from 8:00 to 11:00 and from 11:30 to 14:30
No breaks between classes but a longer break from 11:00 to 11:30 where you usually had a sandwich or some kind of snack to keep you alive until lunch time
I always had 5 minutes between classes
That way you had time to get to your class if it was in another room
I guess this is another very important different bit: in Spain each class is assigned a classroom at the start of the academic year
At least in my experience
You never change classrooms unless it's a special subject like PE or music or art class
The whole classroom changing thing I only saw in American movies and always thought it was funny
Where I study it's more like between classes the time the teacher takes to get to your class is kinda like free time
I ment between PE and art and stuff
I went to highschool in Spain
In 1601 king philip III suddenly ordered the capital be moved to Valladolid
In 1606 it went back to Madrid
Basically it was a HUGE urbanistic complot of his advisor
He bought houses in valladolid, then convinced the king to move the capital, sold them to the crown, bought properties in Madrid, and
you know the drill
This guy moved the capital to be rich-er
He also took bribes
The merchants and financiers of Valladolid paid the Duke of Lerma 50,000 ducats if he had the royal court move to Valladolid
Fast-forward five years, and the financiers of Madrid offered the Duke of Lerma 200,000 ducats if the royal court came back to Madrid
as someone that lives in Valladolid i knew this but im happy to see the story of the only other city that has been a capital of Spain asides from Madrid
Also he bough more houses in Madrid to do the same method
That's the most Belgian thing I've ever heard
**Of course he did**. He was investigated for corruption (probably framed by his political rivals, among them his own son) but he escaped the verdict by becoming a cardenal
It has to be Fallas for me, the festivity to welcome spring
Every month of March, València transforms into this place of pure joy that I cannot even begin to describe
It starts to get a little warm and the sun is so bright, everyone is on the streets, eating churros, hanging out with their friends or relatives, touring the city around watching the [fallas] (huge monuments that we burn on the 19th)
People arrange lunch with their friends and we eat paella under the sun and drink and laugh, and at night time there are dj booths next to every falla and we drink and dance all night
The whole month of march feels like summer and spring all together, everybody is so happy and the whole city is just blooming with joy and people
It's been two years without fallas now, we really miss them
Per cert, feliç Sant Jordi
In Galicia, for me it's Magosto (chestnut festival)
It's celebrated in autumn, and in my village people get together to roast chestnuts and eat together
It's feels like the last time people can get together before the winter sets in and things go quiet, a kind of farewell, until we see each other on the other side
In Madrid, probably San Isidro: music and food everywhere in the older parts of the city, nice weather (it's in mid-May), activities day and night, etc
It's a great way to welcome the sun
I'm from Valencia and my favourite day is [La Gran Nit de Juliol] The great night of July
It is a night in July where you
have plenty of free concerts around the city, the museums are open until late and there are fireworks
It is not as well known as the Fallas but the last few years, before the Covid, it has been great
Some people in Catalonia celebrate both too but I prefer St Jordi because I looooove books :)
Well, I hope you can come back and visit from time to time for St George's day
I used to live in a building in front of Las Vistillas Gardens
I could literally walk outside my door during San Isidro and be in the middle of one of the biggest parties in the city
That was unbeatable
I really miss pre-covid times Spain
Oh yes, I've been to a couple concerts in the river (next to the Palau) in the last summers but I didn't know there were so many activities
I'll keep an eye out for when they start doing it again once it's safe
Well, for all intents and purposes Christmas in Spain lasts 3 weeks, with several landmarks:
* 22nd December - Christmas lottery day
It's not an official festivity but it's undoubtedly part of the celebrations
In the morning the students of the San Ildefonso school draw the numbers of the Christmas lottery, wich is the biggest of the year and popularly known as "el Gordo" (the fat one)
It is kind of traditional to turn on the TV or the radio to hear the rythmical calling of the numbers and know which parts of the country get the prizes
* 24th December - Christmas Eve dinner
For most people this is the main event, when family gathers to have a feast (and I mean it literally, we usually have way too much food)
The King makes a speech right before dinner which will be dissected the following day to extenuation
Old-school Catholics attend a traditional midnight mass
When there's not a plague around, younger people might go out and party instead
* 25th December - Christmas Day lunch
While far less important than the previous dinner, it has also become quite normal to gather with extended family or friends on the 25th to have a more-special-than-usual lunch
The influence of the US has also brought us Santa Claus, who leaves small presents for children, and sometimes for adults that cannot meet on the 6th of January
* 28th December - Innocents Day
This is the Spanish equivalente of April Fools Day
Back in the day even the public TV news joined in the fun and made funny fake reports
Nowadays pranks and jokes seem mostly confined to the Internet, and a special TV program where famous people fool other famous people for charity
* 31st December - New Years Eve
The second biggest event, and sometimes the biggest if for some reason you couldn't make it to Christmas Eve
Depending on your age, financial status, or personal costums, you might have another feast with family or friends, you might party all night long, or you might book a dinner and dance package in a hotel or club
Quirky tradition of the night: instead of counting down loudly, we eat a grape with each of the twelve tolls of the bell at midnight, and then we wish each other a happy new year with our mouths full of mush
* 5th and 6th of January - The Three Kings
On the afternoon of the 5th the Three Kings parade on floats in most towns and cities, often accompanied by Santa Claus, unauthorized Disney characters, relevant local institutions, advertising companies, and others
Candy are thrown out to the public from the floats, sometimes with lethal force
The presents the Magi leave are then handed and open on the 6th
In Catalonia we have one more day in December, the 26th which is Sant Esteve (Saint Stephen's day) and it's celebrated eating canelons for lunch, kind of like the 25th
It's the equivalent of Boxing day
[canelons (cannelloni) ]
Additional info (I'm catalan so mainly it's gonna be info from my region):
• 24th/25th of December: in Catalonia we hit a Christmas decorated log called [Tió de Nadal] with sticks so it shits some presents or candy
It has small legs, a face and Catalonia 's traditional hat called "barretina" glued on top of it
Many schools and kids activities celebrate the Tió before the Christmas break starts, even in swimming classes where you'll hit the Tió with one of those flotation noodles
Defenders of Tió will hate on people who have their gifts brought by Santa Claus
• 26th of December: in some areas we celebrate Saint Stephen's day in which we eat (usually homemade) canelons
These are stuffed with the ground remaining meat from the "escudella", "carn d'olla", turkey, and other leftover ingredients of the previous days
Many families will meet on this day if they couldn't celebrate the 24th or 25th together
• 27th of December: my birthday
Not a national holiday, but it should be
• 31st of December: You will not be able to send a text or make a phone call for a few minutes after 00:00 hits, since we flood all social media with happy new year texts and calls
It doesn't matter if you haven't talked to someone for years, you'll probably get a text from them
Most people just hit the "send to all" button and get over with it
Kids and people who don't like grapes eat Lacasitos, which are similar to M&Ms
Also the ER of hospitals get a lot of cases of people who choked with the grapes
You'll give hugs and kisses on the cheek to everyone in the room, not just one kiss on the mouth with your special person
• 1st of January: some religious people go to mass, Spain's national television broadcasts the Vienna New Year's Concert in the morning (so if you went partying the night before and you live with your parents you'll probably wake up listening to it and it will fuck with your hangover)
You either eat a nice lunch or leftovers from the previous days
Also many people go to the beach and have the first swim of the year, some of them with Santa hats or fully dressed
Middle aged people will not stop joking about they haven't showered since last year
Young people who went partying will probably smell like they haven't showered in a year
Some people will still be partying until the 2nd of January
• 5th of January: Spanish grandmas will fight you to get the candy thrown in the parade, literally
I've seen them push, hit you with a purse, and step on other people's hands when they reach for candy on the floor
Some people put umbrellas upside down to get the candy (it's frowned upon though, and people will confront you)
People carry ladders to the streets so their kids/themselves have a better view of the parade
Balconies on the streets the parade goes through are rented for the same reason, at expensive prices
Kids will go home and count the candy, separate it, and then brag how much they got
• 6th of January: national "we had to take the batteries from all electronics in the house so kids could play" day
Some kid will unplug their grandma from the breathing machine just so they can use the PS5
• 7th-8th of January: kids usually get the 7th off from school so they can keep playing with the new toys, and on the first day of school the little kids bring one toy to school to show it off and play with their friends
Not sure this is still done
• 31st of January: people will start to question whether or not they should throw the Christmas tree away
The 26th of December here in Mallorca is called Segona Festa or “second party”, where you usually gather with your family for lunch or dinner
And you have the Caga Tió... lol
Practically all Spaniards eat the grapes with the midnight bells on the 31
Yeah,  but that's the 24th
Depends on the area, everyone I know celebrates it on la Nit de Nadal
I'm gonna add this to the comment
What we do in my family (I'm still 18 so still a thing for me :P ) is being with one side of the family in Christmas Eve (my father's) and with the other (my mother's) in New Years Eve and the Three King's day, January the 6th
Not this year obviously though
Yes, that's true
In another comment I said that TIL that it can be the 24th or the 25th, I always thought that it was the 24th for everyone
I just learned that Caga tió is celebrated on Christmas eve and the 25th
Where I'm from it's always the 24th
I'm guessing you didn't knew either and I'm your area it's the 25th
Christmas day celebration is widespread nowadays in Catalonia
[caga tió (catalan) ]
Ahhhhh that makes sense
I don't think so, in my family we've always celebrated it the 24th, always
You're just making assumptions
That's a bold statement with nothing to prove it
As I told you, I didn't now that others celebrated it the 25th so we both learned something today
Bon Nadal
No, just by the sight no, could be a Portuguese or Italian or even French
By I would instantly recognize my buddies by the speech volume
Spaniard living in the UK
I can spot other Spaniards from miles away
In fact, I don't need to see them, just hear them
As for a face I would instantly recognize as Spanish: [here]
Now that I've been living here for 3 years, I'd say the average UK bloke is, depending on age,
* old: short, fat with a bear belly and skinny arms and legs, bold, pink colour of skin and face
* young: all with the same haircut where the sides and back are almost down to zero and there's a "step", no gradual transition to the hair on the top
I wonder why on earth this horrible hairstyle is so damn common
Pretty sure that’s my ex
He was 7ft 1 from The Hague
I have friends that look mexicans, jewish, arabs, others instead seem pure blood castillians (not to tall but wide shoulders), some could look italian, french, portuguese or whatever, and then there is the ones who look north European if it wasnt because im not really tall i could look more british german, or for some even slav than spanish, specially friends from the south and tourist zones always tell me so
Yeah, I've been to Portugal a lot and we all look pretty similar
You probably have less redheads though; we have a few of those in the north, but I've never seen any in Portugal
¡Grande Pepe Viyuela
Jajajaja
Wow, wouldn't have thought that hairstyle was so common in UK
I think [he] has very common catalan features AND haircut
He's an actor, he usually plays comedy:
And fake tan, so much fake tan
When I left the UK a female English coworker bought me fake tan, I've never used it
[like this woman ]
That guy looks like he could be from any Mediterranean country, to be honest
I know, he's from Girona, but still his features are very common in Catalonia
I don't know why you think such small distance will make people look different, honestly
I mean, it's mainly used by chavs and certain groups
There are many sensible women there who don't use it but it's far too common to ignore it
Spain is overall quite touristy, but I guess the big cities (Barcelona and Madrid) and the islands (Canary and Balearic) are the ones that have (or used to have given the current situation) the most tourism
However all of the coastal towns/cities (Valencia, Alicante, Cadiz
) also host a lot of the domestic tourism
Magaluf
It's sad that the tourists normally go to the ugliest part of the island
I'm from Spain and I think Barcelona is the most visited area
The other ones also visited are some cities of the community of Valencia (Alicante, Valencia etc) and Madrid is also visited
I have a friend living in Brussels and she took me to Bruges and Ghent and they're both lovely
I mean, Bruges is a UNESCO world heritage site and if I recall correctly it's one of the best preserved medieval places and its the most visited Belgian city so
Chocolate, my friend
It's like mixing Venice and Bavaria
And not as expensive as the Netherlands
I would definitely say Barcelona for oversee tourists and the islands for european tourists
Madrid is the capital and as that it of course also recieves tons of tourists, but Barcelona is just so crowded of Asian and American tourists to another level
But of course, all of the South and East coast also gets the attention, and the North (Camino de Santiago) isn´t unpopular either
I think you are forgetting la Costa del Sol: Málaga, Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Mijas and Marbella are totally saturated every summer, plus there is a lot of retired people who are here the whole year, from UK, Belgium, Germany
Yes, it is hard to say when the entire country is just extremely touristy I guess hahaha, but this year I’ve seen a rise in tourism to places like the northern coasts, or some less touristy coastal towns, just covid things
Benidorm here has been already colonized by germans and British people, and so is Mallorca aswell
I know that it's all about weather, but I don't understand why apparently not many tourists visit the north
Our north (Santander, Basque Country, Asturias, Galicia,...) is absolutely astonishing and beautiful
Surprisingly, Madrid hosted almost 1
700
000 more tourists than Barcelona in [2018] (talking cities, not regions: Madrid 9
716
708, Barcelona 8
045
642)
But this data takes into account both domestic and foreign tourists
Madrid triples the domestic tourist cipher of Barcelona, but Barcelona recieves the most tourist from outside the country
In [2019] and 2020, Madrid repeated as the most visited city in Spain in total numbers
When considering only international tourists, Barcelona continues to be first in both years
It's a nice town, but I'd never say the best place in Spain
There are better beaches or prettier towns in Andalucía
Yes, US states are generally known
Perhaps the not so famous ones you do not know where to put them in the map, but you know they are US's states
Yeah, we know the states by name (don't ask US to name them all)
We Don't know where they are though
If you ask a random guy in the streets where kentucky or ohio IS in a map, he'll just point somewhere in the middle
I'd like to add that powerful sounding names of native american origin like Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wyoming
are instantly recognised as american
It's like saying "I'm from Chongqing, a province in China". Well, no shit
I, personally, know the name of (almost) all the states just by watching them on series, films, videogames, or just talking with people from the US, (with the exception of Washington, I just discovered it was called like that today lmao)
I can even point [some of them] in a map, mainly the most famous ones, the coastal ones, and some of them I had reasons to know (mainly because I like overall American history) for example I liked Minnesota Timberwolves back in the day, Misisipi, or Kentucky (and, of course, those that used to belong to the empire, such as California or Florida
P.S If you want to try the test for yourself you can find it [here] :)
Yes, pretty common to know the names of all (or almost all) US states
You have to understand that half the movies/tv shows we watch are american, your country does a lot of cultural exports and you always talk a lot about states
I dont know all i would just recignice names but axide the virginias florida california new york and others with very recognicable forms as texas but most of them no
but we all know that puerto rico want into usa
It’s also the only us state capital without a McDonald’s
I think most people would recognize many names as American States, even if they're not able to name themselves off the top of their heads
Most people that consume a lot of American media, which is, well, most people, would know that places such as Oregon, Massachussets, Kansas, Virginia, Michigan or Ohio are American states if they hear the names
> save perhaps New York
You may believe New York's capital is New York, but it's actually Albany
Albuquerque, New Mexico also takes the name from a Spanish town, but it's Albu**r**querque, Extremadura
I guess names drift as time goes on
>As the average includes senile old farts who believe aggricukturee is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized, and that we need back franco to bring back virtue in the country and reform the decadent yiuth
Nah, have you seen a population density map of Spain
We Don't have aggrikultors any more
That section of the population IS so small and so far away from the rest they have very little impact in the shape of the country
Bring back Franco isn't that popular either
though i've Heard old people saying they lived better under Franco
So all in all we don't have so many "old farts". Actually vox (our far right wing party) IS going for the youth
>is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized,
And i've never Heard that
If you only count where people actually live, Spain IS higher than the netherlands in population density
we just have vast expanses of almost nothing
Roughly two hungaries with only 7 million people
We're much more cosmopolitan that we may appear
And I always understand CA as Canada
Yeah, that's what I mean
I feel it's a fair distinction to make
People do recognize many of the states, even if they can't list them themselvs
Yeah, our morons are just different
The stardard only admits 2 letters for country
US for USA, CA for Canada, CH for Switzerland and so on
No es lo mismo una pelota vieja que una vieja en pelotas
An old ball is not the same as a naked old woman
I don't think Spanish allows that thing to happen
Arabic seems really tough
Without any doubt Japanese
It’s complexity gets to a point of simple being absurd
If we are talking about European languages, probably any non-Indo-European language or the grammatical complexity of German would be the hardest
Also Polish is completely unpronounceable
I've only tried to learn English and German, and I speak natively Spanish and Catalan
I'd say in order from easiest to hardest (trying to be objective) are: English, Spanish, Catalan, German
Kudos to Estonian
You thought the 4 German cases were hard
Try with the 14 cases in Estonian
(maybe it was 16, I'm not so sure anymore)
Basque, no doubt
Being able to speak both languages (Spanish is my mother tongue, but I've been living in Germany for almost 4 years now) I would say it is easier to learn the basic of Spanish, but it is way harder to become proficient in Spanish than it is in German
IMO up to B1 Spanish is easier, up to C1 German is easier
Fuck yes
Of course, I'm feeling very lucky even tough Spain is not the best place in Europe
But there are 7500 million people in this world and I'm pretty sure 6800 million have it worse, so I'm lucky to be in the top10%
I’m extremely glad I’m european
I mean an EU citizen
Yes, even if sometimes i'd wish there were even more conveniences
I don't feel like a socialist, but I love all the consumer/worker/life protections that we have in Europe
It feels like we have most of the freedom that Americans enjoy but with a lot of rules/protections so that we all can enjoy life
I agree
They don't track who voted what, but they do track who votes, you could vote twice if they didn't. At least they do here in Spain, dunno about other countries
Is it in school when you lads have your first contact with the Irish language or is it common at home for parents to teach their children a few words
We know our government is far too incompetent to keep secrets from us
And even if they were we are far too apathetic
Some people tend to believe that, the fire of the "Windsor Tower" (a building in Madrid) was intentionally started by someone
You can look for more information on the Internet, but basically, it burned at the last hours of the evening (almost night), there were no victims and the official report said that it was started by a cigarette
I personally believe in that it was made intentionally
Some years ago it wasn't that obvious, but it has been recently discovered that some big companies were trying to destroy documents, and so they did it "cleanly", with no victims, and everything seemed like an accident
As a joke we say galicia/murcia (parts of spain) doesn't exist
Don't know how extended over Spain is though
> Velvet revolution was not a peoples uprising but actually a planned  power transfer
That one is actually interesting, since a lot of people  that came to power after the revolution were on very prominent places of  power or knowledge in the old regime while the "political" faces of the  regime get deposited
But I just think that those are the type of  morally flexible shitstains that would flourish in any regime
And yes
I  mean our curent prime minister, our current president and our previous  president
Yeah, I mean, those things always happen to an extent
The politicians come and go, the bureaucracy is eternal
Happened with the Nazis in Germany (many of whom ended up as policemen or Bundeswehr officers after the war, etc
), happened to us in Spain, etc
It's just nigh-impossible to to remove the whole administrative apparatus of a State and start anew, you need to keep some people who know how to run things (even if you guillotine everyone above them), and then more often than not they will stay in power or gain further power
Yeah, those are always very funny xD Like, Cervantes, Columbus, etc
were all Catalan and the evil Castilian government rewrote the history books to cheat the world into believing otherwise
It makes you wonder, if the Castilian/Spanish government is so powerful to play a 500-year con on the whole world, why don't they just use their omnipotence to crush those pesky Catalan rebels xD
For the other side of the coin, there's a fair bunch of people who reallyl belive that Mr
Soros is trying to break Catalonia away from Spain, for whatever reason
In fact, if I google "soros" the second auto-complete option (after his name) is Spanish for "Soros is breaking Spain" xD Oh, and of course, he is also orchestrating the arrival of trillions of black muslims, because of course he is
And in Spain Soros wants to make Catalonia independent, promote LGBT+ degeneracy and so much more
My God, the dude is EVERYWHERE
She completed the immortality event chain, that's why she's still around
That sounds pretty complicated
maybe there should be a state department or a ministry
yeah, a Ministry of Magic to deal with that
I actually haven't heard a lot about Soros in our far right, the boogeyman is usually some shadowy cabal of Catalans, Chavistas or feminists
Remember, rule number one of the Internet is that no matter how bonkers, someone still believes it xD See the Google results for "soros rompiendo españa" if you'd like (I tried linking it, but Reddit doesn't like search result links)
Vox and the people in their orbit do mention him every so often
For example, see [here] They don't mention him as commonly as in many other countries, granted
Yes
I'm Spanish, and Spain didn't participate in WW2
But when the Spanish Civil War started, my great-grandfather decided to move to Germany to avoid going to war and being killed by the opposite band
Unfortunately WW2 started, so he was forced to fight in it
He never returned to Spain because he started a new life in Germany, so we don't know anything about what he lived in WW2
Pretty amazing in Catalan and Spanish, but usually not as complete as the English one obviously
Fun fact: the Catalan Wikipedia was the third one to be created after the English and the German ones, and the second edition that started publishing articles (apparently the German one was created earlier but it took a while until they started releasing posts)
I don't really enjoy the Spanish one
For most general topics that are very good in English, the Spanish counterpart reads either as a mediocre translation or as written by a high-schooler, a teenager fan or a computer-illiterate manager
People look at me like I were crazy when I state this opinion, but frankly, I've read a lot all of my life and I can't shake the feeling that it's subpar in general
Of course there are some high-quality pages, but they're scarcer to the point that Spanish Wikipedia is my last resort, or for Spanish topics where the depth of info is better, no matter the writing quality
I use Wikipedia in Spanish, is really great, but I saw that the design is different in French and English
I'd say it's pretty good on number of articles, but it sometimes severely lacks references or the ones that are provided are shitty
I prefer to use the English wikipedia
The Spanish one have plenty of articles translated with google translator, while others are very badly written
Maybe I am wrong but I think I saw somewhere that catalan Wikipedia has more articles than the Spanish one lol
You're right
With the exception of articles about Spanish stuff, most articles are really bad, it's like you said, most of them are bad translations from the English one and always with less text, like if they got tired translating half-way
honestly the wikipedia shouldnt be the source of anything
better go to specialist pages in english or spanish (or other language if you know mor)
there is something wrong with the slovakian one
also a lot of lack in terms of information in a lot of subjects
It was true at some point, but not anymore by a long shot (1,671,748 vs 675,472):  It's still pretty amazing considering the number of speakers of both languages
Definitel, so crazy, thanks for the data check
Yes, it's what most people drink, and it's safe to drink basically everywhere in the country, although some prefer bottled water
It's true bottled water usually tastes a bit better but I don't think it's worth the effort of spending more money in water and having to bring 2-3 litres per day per person of water from a store
Even when I visit the Mediterranean area (where water is known to taste pretty badly) I just drank tap water
I got used to the taste after a couple of days anyway
When I used to live in Valencia (Spain) which is a Mediterranean city I never ever would drink from the tap
Even when the water is perfectly safe and drinkable the content of minerals (mostly calcium) made it taste like hell
Not even adding flavour works
Only a expensive domestic water softener makes it bearable
Other parts of Spain as Madrid has an amazing water with great taste, but usually south and east coast cities does not
Now I live in Scotland and I always drink from the tap, my hair as well looks amazing here
It depends on the area
In Barcelona I'll never drink from the tap since I don't like the taste, but I know people who do (my dad) and say it's fine
I know in other areas it's usual to do so and in rural towns people bring large bottles and use public fountains to get drinking water
But you won't get tap water in restaurants or bars, it's always bottled water (or at least I've never been in one that serves it)
*And then there's the people from Madrid*. They will tell anyone that their tap water is amazing and will fight you to death if you say it sucks
They're the won't-shut-up-about-it vegans of tap water
If you don't use chlorine, then how is your water kept safe
Ozone
You found the only waiter that wouldn't give you water; practically anywhere they'll happily give you a glass of water if you ask them kindly, even if you didn't buy anything haha
I think you're correct, the law says that all restaurants, bars, night clubs and such are forced to offer bottled water and (if I'm not mistaken) tap water
It might have to do with charging tourists even more
Selling water to hordes of thirsty northern european tourists must be really profitable
The huge public budget we have to allocate to [pensions] and retirement
Its literally a ponzi scheme, the new retirees are already making way less money than the old ones, and the next ones will get even less
The people theorically paying for their own retirement with taxes today are guaranteed to get nearly nothing back
Most retirees have more income than people aged 20 to 34
I would say that the politicians are ultimeteley and irredimeably incompetent but you asked for things Europe doesnt know
It's funny because my experience was the opposite
I lived there a few years ago and I was absolutely amazed by how buses and trams were consistently on schedule down to the minute
Except once that I had to take a night bus line for the airport and it just didn't show up
But I think it was my fault in the sense that it was probably a special line that worked differently and I just disregarded that
But I did meet a Polish guy earlier this year and he indeed told me Wrocław is kind of known for public transport unreliability
Perhaps it's just gone to shit these literal past years because that's really not the experience I had
This is lowkey fascinating and hilarious
Sadly true
(I "live" in Granada)
XD I live there only when I have university classes I AM ALIVE
Probably just in Spain
The market is huge
In Spain is really easy to get a job as English teacher
I mean with some qualification, but being english speaker make things easy
It's sad, I could have gone for way longer but then Wroclaw appeared :'v
Bochum
Germany was getting more difficult by the second, without them I think I would've gotten much farther
Edit: there's 6 cities I don't know: 3 Germans, 2 Romanians and 1 polish
Ah, it was an important city, historically
Back in the day, Spain was the combination of Castille and Aragon at its core (I don't want to open a can of worms here, but perhaps think of England/Scotland or summat)
Castille's power became centred on Madrid after some time being iterant or in Toledo, and Aragon's was somewhat split between Zaragoza and Barcelona
Zaragoza (also known in English as Saragossa) was where Aragon had its origins, and where its kings were crowned, so it was sort of a historic capital of Aragon
However, Barcelona became more important within the Crown of Aragon as it was the actual power centre and economic powerhouse, eclipsing Zaragoza as time went on
Zaragoza nowadays is the capital of the autonomous community of Aragon
All but four
That's impressive
Well, taking into account more people have failed with Germany than poland I wouldn't read too much into it
I knew all but one of the polish cities
I didn't know 3 German cities
Except the Germans almost noone has heard of Duisburg, Bochum, Wuppertal and Bielefeld
Oh, vaguely
I wouldn't say I know enough
Those 2 Romanian cities are there so noone gets to the end
They guard the exit
>Łódź
So it's like a dog barking
They bark guau, so not very similar
Yeah, it's pronounced ˈɡwau̯...tbh it's not very similar
That's because you haven't seen:
**GÜISQUI**
Ps: yeah, it only shares **two letters** with the original word
Lol, never saw it spelled that way although it's probably the correct way to do so in Spanish
Do t try to learn everything at once, it's a simple language with some very complicated nuances
We write 5 vowels, we pronounce 5 vowels
There is little ambiguity here, so try to pronounce them correctly and don't close them too much
Open your mouth as you speak
We have phonemes which are new or difficult for most foreign speakers, and even those who learn Spanish fluently usually never get used to them, so I would say try to practice and refine your strong - rr and - z early
H does not exist, don't let it distract you
Spanish is simpler than most languages in almost every grammatic aspect except for verbs
We have some of the most complicated verb conjugations, but they don't have cases
You can manage with just a few, and there is a very clear order of frecuency (pretérito perfecto compuesto > pretérito perfecto simple > subjuntivo >>>> futuro de subjuntivo)
Note that for speaking correctly you'll end up having to deal with most of them, but trying to get the whole table for every verb from the get go is a pain in the ass
We swear a lot and it's no big deal
Por favor Y gracias will improve almost any sentence you say
Also, there's a difference between Tú and Usted, and it's completely different from American Spanish, try to not mix them up
Lastly, there is a big difference between ser and estar
It is very clear for native speakers and almost impossible to explain using logic, but it's something you will struggle with
Think of it as a nice philosophic puzzle
Is the essence of the being changed fundamentally
Ser
If it's transitory  estar
IDK, this should be mostly a matter of practice, like genres
Also, open your question marks (¿?) or your writing will be mediocre
Most of all, have fun
The Spanish love to see others learn their language, and you'll get lots of jokes and cool useless word from your friends
Learn the nouns with the article so you won’t miss the gender
And for English speakers learn that the verb _to be_ becomes two verbs in Spanish _ser_ and _estar_
For the gender it is really foreign when someone uses the wrong gender in the article like in city _ciudad_ You should learn it as a whole not as a word
So you learn _la ciudad_ “the city” and not _ciudad_ “city” this will help you a lot because it’s feminine in Spanish
In Spanish there’s a rule (which hopefully will help)
if the last syllable contains an “a” 99% will be feminine if it contains an “o” 99% will be masculine
There are some words like “motorbike” _moto_ that has an “o” but is feminine or _cava_ (the drink) which is masculine but this cases and the following one are minimal
Then you have the mix of both, you have “the sea” _el mar_ or _la mar_ this one is tricky, if you refer to the sea as a water body or geographically you will use _el mar_ if you refer to anything related to any activity you can perform there (swimming, fishing, etc) you will use _la mar_
About the verb _to be_:
In English you can say: _he is good_ which depending on context will say that he behaves good or that he is feeling good
In Spanish you will use _él está bien_ to say he is feeling good and you will use _él es bueno_ to say he behaves good
Both are translated as “He is good”
The most difficult part is probably tenses
We have around 10 tenses for the past in different configurations
Depending on the region you're in some are used and some are archaic
Generally composite tenses (haber+ participle) will be understood by everyone and it's less words to learn
Spanish has a ton of exceptions in ortography and grammar, but most of it follows some rules
If you learn the rules you are out of much truble
And try to speak as much as you can
We're all very happy to help you to learn Castellano
It’s feminine is Spanish as well: _la ciudad_
In Spanish there’s a rule, if the last syllable contains an “a” 99% will be feminine if it contains an “o” 99% will be masculine
There are some words like “motorbike” _moto_ that has an “o” but is feminine or _cava_ (the drink) which is masculine
On top of that you have “the sea” _el mar_ or _la mar_ this one is tricky, if you refer to the sea as a water body or geographically you will use _el mar_ if you refer to anything related to any activity you can perform there (swimming, fishing, etc) you will use _la mar_
Edit: I think I should add this comment as an answer as well
Not a great deal, but your accent will always be distinguishable
Because you're not used to it
When we learn English, you'd be surprised how many sound we have to adjust to, and many never do
But I think it's cool that human language has so many possibilities
It's noticeably hard for a Spanish to pronounce a word starting with several consonants, like stop
It's hard not to say "estop", and it's something you will notice most of us struggle with
Your h sound mixes up with our strong J, so I know many people that pronounce a very strong How or Horse, etc
We also don't distinguish b and v, so that's a new thing to get used to, and the soft s was particularly difficult for me (although I can't remember if it's important in English, I had to learn it for German)
That's all I can think of, off the top of my head
Oh, that's very interesting
I never thought u would be a difficult letter, but I admit it is a a bit of an extreme mouth position
The contrary is true for us: when we start out tye closest we can say is 'do llu like
' (as an English J sound)
In hollywood movies all european countries are blue
All our languages have singular and plural forms, and we all use the metric system, we all have had monarchies at one point or another
I mean,in Spain the WWs didn't exactly happen on our soil,but to say we remained unscratched would be a lie
We didn't participate in WW2, but we have had some many wars between each other that your point still holds
I mean, we've been fighting between us since the first civilizations were formed, it's a miracle that we are doing something together now
That would be awesome, but I don't think that would happen any time soon
Don't worry, you're not alone in this
Not the north, they were too busy axing people while europeans built something big
Same, i love ESC, and i was so sad about this year's "thing". We're now in 2021 season now
Happy cake day
Yeah, young people in Spain is mostly atheist
I guess that we have that in common, for what I know most European countries  are evolving to that
Yeah but it didn't even happen nor did we participate but we ended up as or even in worse condition than participating countries
Now it is Luxembourgs turn
The EU feels safe
\- When you leave the door open: "Do you think we are in the Franco era
" (If you don't know, Franco was a spanish dictator in the XX century and thieves feared him
There's also a popular saying: "In Franco era you could go out for hours leaving the door open and nothing would happen")
\- In closed mouth, flies don't get in (In spanish it's: "En boca cerrada no entran moscas")
\- If you say "I'm bored" some mothers may say: "Then eat a donkey" (In spanish "I'm bored" is traduced as "me aburro", and "Then eat a donkey" is traduced as "Pués cómete un burro". It's a spanish rhyme)
And much more than actually i can't even remember
Not exclusive of Spanish mothers, but a common one among small children who pick their noses is  asking if they are searching for oil
I am spanish andm y dad used to tell me this:
If you are cold go to your uncles underpants
you ask your parents for money and they respond:
"Do you think we are the Bank of Spain
when they think you haven't eat enough, it is typically said:
"Do you want me to fry you an egg
If you play with Fire you'll pee on
In Spain we say "close the door or the cat will escape", even if you don't have a cat
Not technically my country, but involved:
Until recently, it was legal to kill Basque people (from the Basque country) in Iceland
[Source]
the word "donut" is a registered trademark by Panrico Donuts(tm), so companies like "dunkin donuts" had to rename to operate in the spanish market (Dunkin coffee in this case)
the word "corona" (crown in spanish) is also registered, so the beer Corona is called "coronita" (Small crown) here
[heres a bunch of town-specific laws too if you want a chuckle]
I wouldn't want to walk on a stone street with high heels either, in fear that the heel would get stuck between the stones
What defines something as a bathroom
Not every bathroom has a bath, or a shower, or a toilet, or a sink
Mostly
Spanish is phonetically consistent, but has a few letters which sound the same
"ge" and "gi" sound the same as "je" and "ji", for example
Also, the h is completely silent and is sometimes found in the middle of a word, like in "zanahoria". So that can lead to mistakes as well
I'm Spanish, so yes, I can actually spell all (or almost all) words just hearing them one single time
Not quite, no
You can know how a word is pronounced by its spelling, but not the other way around, as there's a few letters that are pronounced the same
*b* and *v* (yeah, we pronounce them the same in Spanish), *y* and *ll*, and there's *h* which has no sound, *g* followed by *e* and *i* is pronounced like *j*. There's a few other letters with the same pronunciation, but those usually have rules so you can know when to write each (*c* and *z*)
In any case, a lot of words can be spelled from hearing them, as there's also a bunch of rules that determine spelling
Yes, in Spanish everything is written as it sounds, in fact if I just create a word right now that no spaniard has ever heard, everyone would pronounce it the same way
Mostly, yes
One of the few good things about German language, it is usually spelled how you say it
Please, don't mind if I make some changes to make it more correct:
Tragé el puto baso al lavabajías de mierda y me comí una zanaória cojonuda y un calabacin que te cagas con licor café.
Tienes nivel V2
My dad calls it ‘su oficina’ (his office)
I usually say "el trono" (the throne)
If it's dirty we say "el tigre", the tiger, because of the smell
El trono (the throne)
Sala de pensar (Thinking room)
El señor Roca (Mr
Roca), Roca is a common brand of bathroom equipment and furniture
The Rock, because there's this very famous brand of toilets called "Roca" (Rock in english)
"El cagodromo" - The *shit-o-drome*
Trono (Throne)
The same here in spain
something long or something with ñ
ñoñeria
or esternocleidomastoideo
El perro de San Roque no tiene rabo porque Ramón Ramírez se lo ha robado
It's a tong twister but I always enjoy seeing foreigners trying to pronounce the hard r.
I've heard that our combination of "sz" sound is difficult for foreigners
So maybe words like "piscina" or "ascender" would do
This only works with European Spanish though
I also had a Dutch friend who had problems with words like "arbitrariamente", "condescendientemente" (sc/sz bonus) or "inconstitucionalmente".
He took revenge by making me pronounce the "having sex in the kitchen" sentence someone already mentioned in the comments lol
Also long ass words like desoxirribonucleico, esternocleidomastoideo or supercalifragilisticoespialidoso, I guess
Or tongue twisters like "Tres tristes tigres comen trigo en un trigal". Especially if you have trouble rolling your R's.
I don't try to make them say anything, there's enough fun whenever they try to say anything with an R, like the word *raro* (weird)
Oh, we have a similar one:
Tres tristes tigres comían trigo en un trigal
Un tigre, dos tigres, tres tigres
It's pretty hard to say when you're drunk, even as a native speaker, because it alternates very similar sounds (tre, tri, ti)
I always go for something with 'rr' and with 'll'
>Eichhörnchen
from someone learning german - came here to say this
v and b has the same sound in spanish (although some people try to diferenciate them)
Or a h
I think that's why he said it haha
lol sorry
&#x200B;
i fell vilified
\- Tío (literally uncle)
\- Hermano (brother)
\- Colega (mate)
You can also find by regions:
\- Socio (partner, but platonical)
\- Tronco (trunk, log), typical in Madrid
\- Quillo/Illo (from *chiquillo*, kid), in Andalusia
Bonus track: *pisha* for boys and *shosho* for girls, in Cádiz, literally meaning dick and pussy
Maybe "compá" is what west sicilians from Palermo say, but in Catania people use to say "mbare" (also coming from "compare")
And let me address that "compare" comes directly from the spanish influence, since "compadre" means basically "friend".
I'm from Asturias, in the north
I almost exclusively use *tío* (lit
"uncle", but another meaning would be "dude")
I use *macho* (lit
"male") a few times, and I've seen it used
Apart from that, I guess I've heard *hermano* (lit
"brother")
Macho (male) is very common in Madrid as well, probably the most common after tío.
and add Acho/Acha for us folks in Murcia
Also every single insult that exists in the Spanish language
Nano in Valencia
>\- Quillo/Illo (from chiquillo, kid), in Andalusia
>Bonus track: pisha for boys and shosho for girls, in Cádiz, literally meaning dick and pussy
But those are not a term for friends, you use them with everybody, unknow people too (the same for tio)
I do like to use tronco and tronca, basically means tree log
I Aragón (mostly Zaragoza) we use "co" (from chico) as a vocative i.e "¿Co amigo que haces
It's regarded as a very working class/uncultured expression though, even if everyone uses it from time to time
Edit: Maño/a is also very common to refer to a friend, it's literally just the demonym of Zaragoza
Fill de puta for extra points
I often say Hola gilipollas to my friends
I mean I've never seen anyone say hi with that
Ieee fill
de putaaa
That is also used a lot where I live
That's similar to silly, used often between couples and really close friends
We have the same story in Spain but It happens in granada
So Saint Nick is a guiri
interesting
It happens in Cordoba, in Medina Azahara
I don't really agree with this meaning, but this is copied from wikipedia:
*Guiri (pronounced [ˈɡiɾi]) is a colloquial Spanish slur used in Spain applied to foreign tourists, particularly from countries in northern Europe or the Anglosphere
Many people don't really use it as a slur as we don't really see anything peyorative in the word or about being a foreigner, but some cities have tourist problems so it can be a slur depending on the context (not as horroble as the d, r, f or n words though)
To me it would mean "tourist from other (usually northern Europe or the Anglosphere) who looks and acts like the stereotype and falls into tourist traps". And well, I look like a guiri to most Spanish people, so it has become my nickname too
A tourist from another country
That's the secret: we call you guys guiris
but we are also guiris
Here every town and city has its local festival or fair, and I dare say that practically all of them celebrate it with fireworks, usually a show is organized on the last day of the festival
The best known bcs its love of gunpowder and fire is the Fallas in Valencia, although I don't know if the [mascletá] can be considered fireworks (they are more like firecrackers
It is also quite common to see them at other celebrations such as weddings, birthdays or I don't know, for those who like fireworks any excuse is good
In recent years, the number of people who do not want fireworks because of the damage they cause to autistic people and animals (dogs basically, because we already have cities with [more dogs than children] has increased, so they may end up being restricted in some way in the future
Fallas in Valencia, they make a giant statues and then they set them on fire, and in a nitgh in that celebration we make "La nit del foc" (from valencian/catalan "the night of the fire") where they use a lot of fireworks and it is incredible, we have also the mascletá but in that case it is used firecrackes
10/10 i would recommend it
I used to go to Alicante in Saint johns night and the thing is HUGE
Fire crackers all day and then the mascletá. It's INCREADIBLE
Though i suppose It can get really tiring if you have a pet
I would not consider mascletà as proper fireworks (although I really love it, even more than fireworks) but during fallas you have mascletà every evening at 14:00 and also [fireworks show] every night at 00:00 (except last night when we have the big one: la nit del foc, at 1:30)
Something also interesting that is done with fireworks in a few villages on their festivities are the [toros de fuego]
I'm not an expert, but i'll try to explain what they do
The main part are the paper mache giant sculptures/ monuments
They're marked by judges, and they win prizes, the BEST, the most original, etc
During at least a few days there's firecrackets continuously, fireworks at night and bonfires by the beach
It's total Madness
It all ends with a Big procession where all but the BEST sculpture are burned to the ground:
>little scary
Yeah, i went as a kid and It scared the shit out of me
By the third time you're a bit more used to It
King Alfonso XIII of Spain wrote the script for three porn movies
Well, I have two stories
One is the story of how the USA dropped a fucking nuclear bomb in the Palomares beach (Almería) in1966 and dictator Franco sent one of his ministers to Bath there and show the people how safe it was which was a continuous joke among Spaniards because we knew it wasn't so
Even now there's still a great deal of radiation (and people dying) on that area and the USA didn't do shit to clean it
The other story, and much older, is the Esquilache riots, in the XVIII century the Spanish Minister the Marqués of Esquilache decided that long capes and broad hats must be banned to favour facial recognition of thugs and criminals and people was so against it that the rioted
It went so bad that the king had to move from Madrid to Aranjuez and he sent the army
In the end they had to convince people to use short capes the French way telling them that it was more fashionable and that the executioners were the ones wearing long capes and with this silly solution he barely scaped the insurrection
Goya painted his "motín de Esquilache" to reference that stupid moment in our history
The time Murcia wanted to become an American State
France: yo, Spain, we really want to invade Portugal, is it cool of we cut through
Spain: yeah, no worries bro
It's not like Napoleon is slowly conquering all of Europe are anything
France: *invades Spain*
Spain: *surprised Pikachu face*
All the Borbones have great stories about pornography and "sinful" lifestyle, so I'm not surprised at all
Alfonso XIII was a man who saw the oportunity and took it, he embraced the technology with open arms
Also, one of his ministers (the good old Romanones) produced porn films in Paris and brought them to Spain
Was that the king that arrived in Spain, and after he saw the fucking mess we had here he just said "Fuck this shit" and left
Wait what
Are they on porn hub
I have to watch these
I see your ship, and raise [an entire navy
By the way, we called the armada "the invincible"
Yeah, royal inbreeding was bad
I also heard that people were mad at the ban of long capes because at the time Madrid didn't have a sewer system and it smelled terrible so people used the capes to cover their nose
I couldn't find any source in English, so here's one in Spanish:
No, they didn't. They were close to reach a solution but in the end there wasn't a signed agreement between both governments (the Spanish government at that time was only in functions) and then came Trump and everything got stopped
I haven't heard about that but it's possible
Thanks for sharing
[Long answer]
Short answer: Cartagena was under a 6 month siege by the Spanish central government and sent a letter to Ullises S. Grant proposing that Cartagena became a similar thing to Gibraltar
Obviouly it never happened
For what I can read, there might be more
The article says those are the only ones conserved
When you go ro live to another EU country you are like and have to be treated like a national of the country you are living  now, same rights, same duties, same benefits, same taxes
Barriers:
Language
Have no fucking idea about what paperwork is needed, specially taxes hahahah
I am a spanish living in slovakia, all was fucking alien to me for almost 1 year hahahaha
I moved to the UK back in the good old days when it was still part of the EU
Hopped on a plane, got here, rented a flat with a couple of friends and applied for a social security number (very easy to do)
That's it
For healthcare, here you have to register with your local General Practice (GP)
Again, very easy process
Each country has their own version of a sc number or resident ID, with different names, and different processes
Same for registering for healthcare, the process varies
But essentially, you just need to tell the government "hey, I live here now", and that's pretty much it
That doesn't mean they can kick you out, though
Each country has their own rules and can deport you if you don't meet certain criteria
I think in the UK it was something like "if you don't have a job after a number of months and you don't have savings, you're out". But I think they rarely enforced it
It's not a political or administrative issue anyways
Nobody in Spain ever called "La armada invencible" like that (that name is product of British propaganda) its official name was "La grande y felicísima armada" (the great and the most happy armada)
but but the flag with the erin harp
my live was a lie
Wait what
Really
Yeah, I know because ETA used that little island for contraband
Why was Sweden planning that
What was the potential gain
The city of Zamora in Spain has 61
000 inhabitants in 150km^2 and most of their streets are practically deserted in winter
Rovaniemi must be like a ghost town
The second name is still more tragic
>Later he got German citizenship, lost the Czechoslovak one and collaborated with Hitler to support his brand
That boat sunk fast
some of them where languages that where obsorbed by a mayor languages in the development of the kingdoms such as astur-leones ended been destroyed and integrated in castille
I know what you are referring to, there's some people like that for sure, but sometimes when I really don't understand what they are saying to me in Catalan they tend to believe that it's because I'm a bigot when in reality even if it's only a couple of letters it's difficult to understand, especially if it's spoken and not written since the pronunciation makes it harder
I know Galician and people sometimes really don't understand things when it varies less from Spanish than Catalan, I thought it was stupid too but then I realized it was easier for me because I was raised with it
If you know both Spanish and Catalan you might be able to understand something an Italian says because of the shared root, but not all of it
It's true that Spanish and Catalan are closer together, but that doesn't negate my argument
What I'm trying to say is, some people are idiots and do it on purpose, but Catalan is a different language, you can't expect people to understand you every time
Also, you are really really exaggerating by saying it's roughly half of the population
I learned about the color watching the EuroBasket
Just like as a kid learned Orange was for Netherlands in the World Cup
So that means the New Zealand is the lead producer of kiwis, interesting
I confirm
U think wales wins, 600 IS a lot of castles, and i say that coming from spain
We have a loooot of castles
well im from castille so i had any interest in learning catalan when i dont think of going there for non expecific reasons
LMAO this is like the tiny island denmark and canada fight for each few months haha
I guess the main difference is how you define cities
We wouldn't consider the houses scattered in the woods as part of the city
They would be part of other municipalities
Even "funnier" when you know that in 1942 Franco changed the time GMT+0 in Spain for GMT+1 to please Hitler
well the origin is a legend but they adopted the flag not so long after
Yeah, but strangely enough it's not that simple
Which time do you prefer better, winter time or summer time
Because winter IS standard time
Summer IS even more misaligned
I mean why cant we fight all war like this
Haha
it should be when it was french becouse fishing can be very regulated depending the autonomous goverment of the zone
well the military always love to do plans just for having them in case you need them
Is it just that
well its just 100 years later in documents so its not that long
i was expecting more 150 years
Yeah, it would be better, but
What about the memes
Haha
Seriously though imagine all world wars sending their best drinkers in a fight
The one that handles that better gets the land or whatever the f they are drinking for
No wars, no suffering, no pain no dramas, just a goos time like the one you're having for an island haha
No I was wondering whether Urge is just julmust marketed differently
Har aldrig haft den, ska prova köpa ett par flaskor från ICA nästa gång :)
Har du förslag på märken eller är de lika varandra
Jag ska kolla då :) Vilket är minst sött
Är spansk/egyptisk fast jag bor här och försöker träna min svenska så ofta jag kan hehe
[The 1 and 2 cent coins] were initially introduced to ensure that the transition to the euro was not used as an excuse by retailers to heavily round up prices
However, due to the cost of maintaining a circulation of low-value coins by business and the mints, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands round prices to the nearest five cents (Swedish rounding) if paying by cash, while producing only a handful of those coins for collectors, rather than general circulation
Despite this, the coins are still legal tender and produced outside these states, so if customers with one-cent coins minted elsewhere wish to pay with them, they may
The Nederlandse Bank calculated it would save $36 million a year by not using the smaller coins
Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to retailers' desire for €1
99 prices, which appear more attractive to the consumer than €2
00 (psychological pricing)
According to a Eurobarometer survey of EU citizens, 64% across the Eurozone want their removal with prices rounded; with over 70% in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia
Only Portugal and Latvia had a plurality in favour of retaining the coins (49% against removal, 45–46% in favour)
Source: Wikipedia
The argument for keeping them is to have exact prices, removing the possibility of sketchy rounding etc
What if we just express money in ⅒ increments so that prices would be like 3,2€ instead of 3,20€? That way there aren't any rounding issues and we can get rid of the 1, 2, and 5 cent coins
Psychological pricing strategy ;)
It depends heavily on the country
In Germany or Spain is less common than in Estonia or Finland
That term simply does not exist here
Nobody knows what they are, the only info we have about them comes from american tv shows or movies
We are not so widespread, but this comment and many below it are sorely misinformed
There are at least 500 active scouting groups in Spain, in several different organizations
We are much closer to the swiss/European model others have discussed, but because Spanish cities don't usually have widespread access to nature, we are quite limited in our ability to camp and do survival activities
In my experience we get around 6-7 trips to the countryside per year, including the 10-15 day summer camp
And yes, the public is extremely unaware of our existance, which is a pity, honestly
A random person in Spain can probably tell you more about American boy/girl scouts than about local scouts (which are always mixed)
Edit: If you're curious to see the distribution and density of scout groups, I found [this map] I'm not sure if it's comprehensive but I think it's interesting to see
Yes, I don't think something similar exists in Spain
One of my best friends was a Scout (first as a kid and later as a leader) and I know two other people that were scouts as well (not related to my friend)
I never was a Scout myself but my friend always talk good thinks about Scouts, and it seems is very similar to the other European Scout experience
A fun group for kids(boys and girls together), to encourage friendship, cooperation, and other good values
They have been traditionally confronted against Juniors group (not sure if is a thing outside Spain but they are definitely catholic related)
I can just tell them apart because scouts use to have a green scarf and juniors had it yellow)
Now I live in the UK and I have a Scout group in front of my home, and as far as I can tell they are as well a group of kids with mentors of 15-20 yo having fun, singing songs and wandering around
I'm 40+ now
I grew up in the city of València and I had plenty of friends in the Boy Scouts when I was a kid
Dunno if them don't exist anymore in Spain, but the term of course existed and wasn't really that rare a few decades ago
Wow, I didn't knew there are scouts in Spain
Where are you from
Is a common thing in your region
I live in Madrid and never heard anyone being a scout
Summer camps at most
I had no idea that scouts existed in Spain, I didn't even know they existed in Europe
I'm very surprised right now hahaha
I reckon there must be some of them, but I have never met anyone who is a scout
And if you ask someone in Spain whats a scout, they'll tell you thinhs about the ordinary amwrican movie scout
I reckon there must be some of them, but I have never met anyone who is a scout
And if you ask someone in Spain whats a scout, they'll tell you thinhs about the ordinary american movie scout
Well, what part of Spain are u from
Keep in mind that I live in a city, but the basque country has a lot of mountains and rural places to go
As an ex-scout for 15 years here I completely agree
They definitely exist and in certain places like Aragon and Valencia have reasonable public presence, but maybe still too little
Really
Well, Im basque, so that might be the reason I've never heard of such groups
Yes, a few groups exist, but as somebody said before, our groups here are really small and I didnt even know these groups existed in so many places
I thought that they only existed in the US, like collectingmedals and camping in the woods
I'm from andalusia, so probably up there you do have it easier finding a nice prairie, hahah
[20
000 Catalan scouts according to Wikipedia] For sure not as popular as the "esplais", but still
[Euskal Eskaut Gia Elkartea]
Apparently there's a [large tradition of scouts in the Basque Country] even if they're not that popular nowadays
Well, in countries with very few scouts (Spain for example) most young people only know about US scouts
Its a pity that they dont know where they came from
Well, I'm no scout, but it is indeed really easy to find a nice place to go hiking
Some remaining civil war bunkers, the Gorbea
Quite a nice place, although the times I have been on holiday I've gone to Huesca, near the Pyrenees
A ton of places to go and hike
My favorite one was a lake in the middle of a mountain
It was beautiful, and the water was nice
I even bathed in it
It was a glaciar lake, so it was clean water
Tha Basque Country is indeed a beautiful place
You have great cities, like Bilbao and San Sebastián, a ton of rural areas, mountains
It is a great place to do rural tourism or go to the beach
Oh, I didnt know
Guess youre right
Well, it makes sense given the amount of rural areas here
No, heat isnt the problem
You see a lot of people hiking near the pyrennees, near the border with France
I am from Spain and can assure you that most of the people here know what scouts are
I’m not saying they are massively popular but im sure a vast majority of us know they exist in Spain too
I personally know some people who were scouts when they were little
Well, most spanish people dont know a lot about foreign countries
Thats 1 reason for the low count of Spanish people in reddit
Add that to the fact that the English you're taught in school is pathetic
I am currently on level C1 in my English academy, and on school we've just began with B1
I think pretty much anyone you ask would say they have heard of it
Perhaps it’s not as popular as it is in other parts in Europe but I mean, it’s common knowledge
Are there any Roman ruins in your country
If so, are they well preserved
Italy or course has a lions share of ruins from the Roman era
Countries like Romania, Germany, Georgia, the U.K. and others that had parts of their territory under Roman control at some point must have some Roman sites as well, I’m assuming
Yes there are
Some are better preserved than others
A lot, for example: most of asfalt roads lie on top of roman roads
My city was founded by Romans
Country: Spain

[This song] by Radio Futura
It's extremely 80s and was like a meme with how popular it was
I'm not really ashamed because a lot of people liked it but listening to it at a party or something nowadays would be weird
It's about taking a girl out to dance but it turning into a really lame date where she pretty much uses the guy to get expensive food and drinks and doesn't pay much attention to him
The chorus is a bunch of metaphorical/hyperbolic rumors about the girl that they probably wish they'd taken seriously
I would never confess I enjoy any song from Camela but I know the lyrics of some songs from the beginning to the end
[Nunca debí enamorarme - Camela] or any other song by this duo
I'm particularly in love with this version feat Taburete
The typical songs that we all make fun of because is cheese and exaggerated, worthy of the best Turkish soap opera
but EVERYONE knows the lyrics and when you listen to them you're immediately transported back to your childhood, to your town's festivities, getting into the bumper cars or going all-out dancing with a few extra drinks at the carpa municipal
"Por qué te empeñas en seguir amandomeeeEEEEEEEEEE
I listen to this song on my way to work almost every day, and it was what made me start enjoying the proclaimers' music
so good
I just post practically the same  but about "nunca debí enamorarme"!  They re definitely our national guilty pleasure JAJA
Our cuisine \[Spain\] is awesome
&#x200B;
But I'd like to give a shoutout to Portuguese cuisine, which doesn't usually get as much publicity as Spanish, French or Italian, but it's just as a good
Chorizo is not an ingredient of Valencian paella
F**k you [Jaime Oliver]
100% of the people in my country agree that " all this was field before" (todo esto antes era campo)
That despite the bad economical and working situation, there’s no country that has a better quality of life than Spain
I don’t think anyone who has lived abroad wouldn’t agree on this
Spain: Rice with things isn’t Paella (This mainly apply to people from la ‘Comunitat Valenciana’)
Also about pineapple on pizza
Unas tapícas to buenas se follan a más de la mitad de la cocina europea
It isn't, but when you compare it to Italian or Spanish food
You don't need to be italian to find that disgusting
No offense
Ja, as a Spaniard I find this awful too, and I’m sure everyone in Spain would think the same :/ my German ex ate them with ketchup, disgusting
No, it’s good, find another thing
Un poco innecesaria la crudeza, pero sí, una de lmis cosas favoritas en mi ciudad es la feria de la tapa jajaja
Okay, you do you(?)
Italy and Spain shake their collective heads in dissapointment
I didn't even know that was a thing
I don't know man, chapata is pretty great
Still, that's only a fifth
Then you just hate the Spanish restaurants and hotels you visited
I totally get it, lots of them are tourist traps, next time check with locals first
Even Reddit is filled with people eager to help
Man you just ate at a couple bad places and think that Spanish cuisine in its whole it's horrible
I'm sure your country just like every country in the world has shit restaurants and tourist traps too
Oh ok
Lived in Dublin for a few months
I went lots of times to the same cafe, and chatted a little with the same waiter each time
Once I didn't have any cash so I paid by card
He asked for my ID and after reading it he said to me in spanish: "that last name has to be spaniard". He was from Spain too
So, it took more than a few minutes
But normally we spot the spaniard sooner
I can even recognize a Spaniard 5 meters away from me
It's like a super power
Hearing the voice, the accent, the way to interact is completely different, from others countries, so it's easy
Yes, I was in Venice and a couple came to me and asked in English if I could take a picture of them, I did and then when they thanked me and they were leaving I overheard them speaking my language
Another story, this one embarrasing to be honest
I had a German girlfriend for a while, we met here in Mallorca while she was on holidays and then I visited her and she introduced me to her family and friends
One night we were having a dinner with some friends and one of them asked me what I thought about germans tourists in Mallorca and I said well, germans get often drunk but at least they're civilized and they don't break urban furniture, jump over parked cars, jump off balconies, and get too crazy on the streets like brits do
He was british, I didn't know, holy fuck poor guy, I felt pretty bad, his first impression of me must have been awful xD
Ah oui oui mec
It would be diffcult for me to spot you as English, because they are usually very polite
Sure
But I suppose it was a funnier way to approach it :)
There are a few things that are written as they would be in Spanish, instead of how a native speaker would say them colloquially:
>I went lots of times
Colloquially one would say something like “I used to go to this cafe all the time” or “I used to frequent this cafe” or “I would normally go to this one cafe
” There’s quite a few different ways to say this
>chatted a little with the same waiter each time
“And would usually chat with this one waiter
>once I didn’t have any cash
“One time I didn’t have any cash” or some people would say “this one time
>he asked for my ID and after reading it
“He asked for my ID, and after looking at it
It’s worth noting that nothing here is incorrect, some of it just seems a bit more textbook than colloquial, but there are 1000 different ways to say or phrase everything
As u/odajoana pointed out, omitting the I that goes with “I lived” is technically not grammatically correct but a lot of people would say it without the I. Such as “went to the store the other day and bought a potato” or “was at work the other day and had to stay late” or “lived in Dublin for 3 years before moving to Paris
” Especially if you’re going on to tell a story which takes place in the setting discussed in the first sentence, saying it this way is not uncommon
All of what you all have noted is totally true, my English is not the best and I appreciate all of it as it is a way to improve !
Not in Spain
As in most places in Europe deliveries have to be made in person and signed (or, now that we avoid any contact, you need to give your name and ID number), they can't just be dropped in your door nilly-willy
If the package came through the public post and you're not home you will get a notification slip so you can pick it up from your nearest office
If it's a private shipping company you can ask for a new delivery, pick it up from their office or warehouse (edit: or a drop point in an associated store), or request to have it delivered to a neighbour or nearby business you trust
If you live in a big enough city there might be Amazon lockers or similar but those are far less common
I've just taken the Three Wise Men presents from my parents home's porch into it after three hours outside because it's starting to rain
Before the porch there's a fence, but the door is open and the house is in the main avenue of the town
We wouldn't trust doing this in a bigger city, though
Never seen that but on Reddit xD
Packages are given personally or, in case you are not at home, in the post office and you have to go get it
They never leave a package at your door
Well in Spain I used to not have problems but here in London and to be specific, Finsbury Park, package life expectancy is very short
The delivery service won’t care if it has to be signed
They will drop it there literally in the middle of the street
This
Most of the time they deliver a package and nobody is home they either deliver it to a oficial delivery point (usually an officially approved business) or in some cases even a neighbor
Luckily, so far we've never have had a package stolen, mostly because of that, and because we live in a 'closed' community of neighbors in a building of 10 residences
I live in a house in Spain
If I'm not home, they just drop the package over the fence
If they need my ID or name, they call me over the phone
I never had a package stolen anyway
Oh, sorry
I knew there was a willy there but I wasn't entirely sure where
It makes sense it's at the front
"They just drop the package over the fence"- that's the key point
Here houses have fences, the "front yards" aren't just open like in the US
She's the most accurate example to give to all those who nowadays believe that having a woman as PM will imply further women's empowerment
In fact, Thatcher's policies were quite the opposite to women's empowerment, especially for working class women
Where did I say all the power must be left to men
Because I can't find it
I just mentioned the fact that a women ruling a country doesn't necessarily mean any change for the better, especially if that women is hurtful to other women and cracks down on their rights
Next time read carefully and think twice before typing so that you don't come up with a fallacy as an answer
Albacete
We actually have a saying about it: Albacete, shit and leave

Andalucia has some of the most beautiful cities on Earth, and then there's Algeciras
Blandest: Madrid, most boring: Milan, soulless: London
*Note: I havent visited all that many
Also they have wonderful landmarks, just coexisting with less wondurful city spaces
I strongly agree
this was my first thought before I clicked on this thread
Britons and elders from the rest of Spain
Literally the worst place in all of Spain
I've heard good things about Montenegro though
What places are worth visiting, if not the capital
I've heard so many extremely opposite thoughts on Sofia and Bulgaria in general I'm confused
Well, MK hosts the longest (not largest) mall in Europe (and previously in the world)

Speaking of Serbia
How do you recommend Belgrade or Novi Sad for 3 weeks in January
Also how different is the country compared to the UE (I've never left the UE), in terms of safety, etc
Never got to see it open but probably you are right
Thank you so much
How's the nightlife
Does it have a young atmosphere
Are there frequent meetups
(travellers, expats, language exchange meetups
I will say the letter "ñ" in Spanish
It is not an "n" with an accent, but a letter for itself
It makes an huge difference:
- Tengo 20 años = I am 20 years old
- Tengo 20 anos = I have 20 anuses
As you see, there's a lot of difference
Another important thing in Spanish are accents (á, é, í, ó, ú, ü), they also change the meaning a lot in nouns
But as your post asks about letters, I will skip this part
Are the first two sentences pronounced any differently
Cuantos anos tienes
Me gusta el helado en cono - I like the ice cream over a cone
Me gusta el helado en coño - I like the ice cream over a pussy
N is not Ñ
Now that I count them, five
I went last year to Chernobyl and swam in a lake with dolphins of two heads
I think that has something to do
Wow
They are very similar
Moreso if we add the fact that the letter "ñ" was born as the abbreviation of "nn".
The same in Spanish, though with the accent pointing to the right
And "papa", besides the meaning of Pope, is also slang for potato in some places
I can't express with words how much I relate to this
Lol that must lead to some interesting conversations
The "~" was actually a small "n" that slowly got flattened over the centuries
You should know that there's an European order (I'm not sure if it's just an advice or a "law")  regarding the price of the ECTS (the European way of measuring hours of teaching)
It says that extra-European citizens (non-European in this case) are bound to pay the 100 % of the total prize of one ECTS, while a European are bound to pay quite less depending on the city
I know for sure that, in Spain, an extra-European student has to pay like x4 times more than an European one has to
Precisely, in France, some months ago there's been some controversy because "they should do the same" (according to some European institutions), but fortunately France is not doing it yet
You should look it up before make a decision, because the most of the European people are not aware of this
I know this because I used to work helping people to enroll in a Spanish university
Not free in Spain but pretty affordable
It goes from 800 euros in Andalusia, to 2000 a year in Catalonia
In Spain it can go from 600€ per year to like 2300€, but it tends to be in the 1000€-2000€ range
Also when you fail a class, it increases its cost substantially the following year (and it increases even more the third time you take it, to like over twice the original price)
In Spain in most regions it is usually 1200€ per year for Spaniards
Excluding accomodation, transportation, etc
Catalonia and Madrid are closer to 2000€ and Andalusia has a universal 700€ fee
But our salaries are similar to Portugal so there's that
I have been looking for this regulations in the universities in Andalusia, that I am more familiar with, and haven't found different tuition fees or any mention of price differences for non-Europeans
Maybe is just in Madrid or Cataluña?
Actually, I don’t know, since I think Andalousian universities are free for everyone now
But what I can say it’s the most of the time this fee for non-EU is likely hidden in order to get more people to apply for it
Coffee and pastries, at a coffee shop
Good wine and good cheese
Food, in general, is pretty cheap
And Spain, in general, is pretty cheap to live in (depending on the area, of course, I live in Catalonia)
Fresh fruits and vegetables (food overall is decently priced)
Whenever I leave Spain, I realize how cheap they are in here
Olive oil definitely
Probably fish as well
And vegetables
Coffee (about 1,20€ for a cup) . I ordered a cup of coffee in Paris and nearly had a stroke when I saw the bill
Alcohol and drugs
Fruit is very cheap especially in Andalucía as well as certain vegetables
We export a lot of produce to northern countries
I can buy a crate full of tomatoes in summer for like 4€ and freeze enough puré to last all year
Good olive oil, good ham, good wine
Payed 6€ for a coffee in Paris once
They are way cheaper in Spain (40-60 cents)
Probably the french ones are better
>Hence we host all your stag parties, where you barf and piss on our streets
Living in a town on the Spanish coast, this is pretty relatable
We definitely do
You're invited to come
It depends on what country you compare it with
Compared to Western Europe, it's probably cheaper (except Portugal, I think they have similar prices to us)
If you compare it with most Central/Eastern Europe, it certainly isn't.
> only place I have been able to find cheaper wine in regular supermarkets was Moldova
Wines can be very cheap in Spain supermarkets
Cheap wines range from 1 to 3 euros
Don Simon is usually around 1,50 in most supermarkets
But there are Don Simon "imitations" (wine in carton) that are sold with the supermarket label (dia, hacendado, alcampo, etc
) usually at 1$ and often cheaper than that
But wines in carton like that are mostly used for cooking (wine is used often in Spanish cooking)
It is rarely drunk alone xD
It is good for kalimotxo because Coke is stronger in flavour
But it is not even good for a basic "tinto de verano" with lemon soda xD
I like the sound when I’m in bed
yes a lot, best thing to fall asleep
There's a Spanish cheese called "queso de tetilla", which translates to "small tit cheese", as its shape resembles a breast
In Spanish it would be:
Hola, me llamo Juan
Un placer conocerte / Encantado de conocerte
¿De dónde eres
\- Hi, (I) call myself John
A pleasure know-you/ Charmed to know-you
¿Of where are (you)
Hola me llamo Juan, es un placer conocerte
¿De donde eres
Hello, I call myself John, its a pleasure to meet you
From where are you
Trying to keep the meaning of each word in both translations, the result is not that bad
>Hola, mi nombre es John/Juan, eso es un placer conocer tú. ¿Dónde eres tú de
>Hi, my name is John, that is a pleasure meet you
Where from are you
I also tried google translating each word and back
> Hola, mi nombre es Juan, eso es uno placer a reunirse tú. ¿Dónde son tú desde
> Hi, me name it is John, that it is one pleasure to get together you
Where they are you since
Hola, me llamo John, es un placer conocerte
De donde vienes
Hello, to me I call John, is a pleasure to meet you
From where you come
ARRIBA ESPAÑA!!!!
Up Spain
wouldn't the 'me llamo Juan' part translate directly as:
me I call John
Turkish can be hard with all the affixes, but it is a very regular language with no irregular verbs, so it has some easy parts
We have that in Spanish :P
Not really, the verb is llamarse, it's reflexive, so it's something I do on myself
Hmm, the problem is it's not a separate word, is a part of the verb marking it's reflexive aspect, so I translated it as 1 word, but I guess you could say it would be then "(I) myself call John"
Yeah that’s what I got from the topic which is why I posted my comment above
Brown bears, the Mediterranean/European Black Widow, scorpions and some venomous snakes, mostly vipers, can be extremely dangerous if you encounter them
But it's rare
Statistically, boars and wasps are probably more dangerous
Pedro Sánchez
Vipers, bears, wolves, boars
and maybe bugs that carry illnesses like ticks
How can the common snake be more dangerous than that tiger
Finally the comment I was expecting to come up
Appreciate
Okay, that sounds really funny
In Spain the PM works as the President in the US
(It's actually named President of Government, not prime minister but English media go after the British standards for naming)
Over him is the king, but obviously he is just a figurehead
In Spain our president is really more of a Prime Minister, but Franco called that position President and we still call it president for whatever reason
I never paid much attention to it
But in a daily basis you can always see the EU flag in public buildings along with the one of the country and of the Autonomous Community (in my case Andalusia)
There are also EU flags in some turnarounds
I'll not fly it above all because we Spaniards don't usually fly flags
You'll almost exclusively only see people flying Spanish flags in some houses/apartments when the national football team is going to play
Besides that, it's pretty rare
No not at all but to represent this better
I didnt knew that there was a europe day
Actually since last years it's been common to see Spanish (or Catalan) flags hanging from balconies but it's a sign for others, some Spanish people are worried about what it means and others are proud of it
In Spain it's, at least, controversial to fly a flag
I wouldn't fly a flag, I support Europe but I don't support what a flag means in Spain
I'm obliged to ask:
Why you Germans are the most "European nationalistic" of all Europe
Every German thing I see advertised always say "Made in Europe", "#1 in Europe", "European tech".
People in Spain use flags to attack other people
The Spanish flag for example, for some people, has negative connotations because they see it as a reminder of the dictatorship, and is employed by the right wing when they protest against things like abortion, LGTB rights, Catalonia
Nobody flew flags in Spain until 4 years ago or so
There was not a single flag on the streets / balconies until Catalans started hanging the flags of Catalan independence on their balconies as a mean to protest and show their pride
Those who were anti-independence took that as an offence and so they started hanging the Spanish flag in opposition, as if to saying "no, that is not going to happen, you are and will always be Spain". And that's how the Game of Flags started in Spain and now they're a very controversial issue
Flags have always been seen as an extreme nationalist symbol in Spain anyway, but in recent years it's gotten worse
Usually the Spanish flag is used by far right parties like a symbol against those who "lost" the Civil War
Today that flag doesn't represent all Spanish people
It's a shitty situation
My poor mother, who doesn't give a shit about politics, hung the Spanish flag on the door of her house when we won the World Cup in 2010
She loves to decorate the house for any occasion, no matter how insignificant it may be, and when your national team wins, it's normal to put up the damn flag
My father made a special stand for it because where they live it's usually windy, so she decided not to take it down (plus we had quite a few sporting successes at that time, which was her main reason for hanging the flag)
Now her house is "the house of the flag" and she has received more than one comment like "ah, that's your house
Why do you have that flag
Do you want to be called facha (fascist)
The flag is still there because she likes it, she doesn't want to waste the support my father gave her and she doesn't feel like giving in to anyone's pressures
She usually hangs other flags, but not the European flag because she doesn't know there is EU day lol
>she has received more than one comment like "ah, that's your house
Why  do you have that flag
Do you want to be called facha (fascist)
I'm from Madrid and if you ask that question to someone with the flag you'll get a very aggressive answer
Some time ago I tried to get a United Federation of Planets flag to hang from  my balcony but they were too expensive just to troll neighbors
A good one from this year: Mientras dure la guerra
(As long as this war continues)
It's about the life of Unamuno during the Civil War, including his famous speech to a bunch of fascists, when he was almost lynched and had to be saved by Franco's wife
It's basically about a conservative man who realizes that fascism is more dangerous than it seems
The speech makes the whole movie worth it, it's awesome
I think it's in wikiquote too
Here's the trailer:
- *Celda 211*. It's about a prison riot and it's brutal but amazing
- *Mar adentro*. Total drama
Based on a true story about euthanasia
- *Isla Mínima*. Basically Spanish True Detective
- *El laberinto del fauno* (Pan's Labyrinth)
You probably know this one already
- *Los santos inocentes*. Based on a novel
It's already 40 years old but it's great
Total drama too
La piel que habito - The skin i live in
"Ay Carmela" A tragic comedy about the civil war
The name is a famous antifascist song (watch the movie or not, but the song is great
Any Almodovar movie, but his best movies are probably "Volver" and "The Bad education".
Torrente
The 5 of them
Campeones
For spanish cinema, I would say:
-El Espíritu de la Colmena (Víctor Erice, 1973)
Unanimously best spanish film in history
-Arrebato (Iván Zulueta, 1979)
Highly recommended cult film
-Blancanieves (Pablo Berger, 2012)
Must-seen masterpiece of this century
-Magical Girl (Carlos Vermut, 2014)
Representative film of the new wave some spanish filmmakers have been exploring in the last decade
* Viridiana
* Blancanieves (2012)
* Quién te cantará
* Magical Girl
* Dolor y Gloria
* Pan's Labyrinth
Amazing movie
Great recommendation
My favorite movie
I watch it every year
So sad and wholesome
I would add Viridiana
A masterpiece of Buñuel criticizing naive Christian charity and in favour of progress
*Tesis* as well for a great thriller, although it's quite a hard watch
I remember watching *Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios*, but I don't remember if I liked it or not, but I do remember there were funny moments, and as we have recommended only dramas or thrillers, maybe this will do for something in the field of comedy, although having been nominated for an oscar many people will probably know about it
*AzulOscuroCasiNegro* is a bit more indie and modern, about a homosexual descovering his sexuality
*Balada triste de trompeta* is quite madness but incredibly good
However, without a doubt, the one I'd recommend the most, and fills the role of comedy, is *Amanece que no es poco*, which is an absurd comedy film about a litle agricultural town deep in Spain with very peculiar inhabitants
*Tarde para la vida* is great as well
Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso
Do you want to kill him
Whoever is reading this, Torrente is basically spanish shitposting
But watch it
I would reccomend you "Airbag", or any Álex De la Iglesia film ("El Día de la Bestia", "La Comunidad", "Balada Triste de Trompeta", "El Bar")
Another recent comedy I enjoyed a lot was "Abracadabra" by Pablo Berger
Spanish movies are all about drama
Your friends are summer children
We all should push the UK to help it literally leave europe if brexits succeeds
Vatican
US take out the aliens, we take out the predators
> Also European women raiding Mount Athos would be fun to watch
Yes please
Do they have a border guard or something
Somebody gotta steal the stolen water
There's a difference between a private propierty not open to the public and a whole peninsula
Angela, without a doubt, even if she is too conservative to me
Angela Merkel for sure
She could be more pro LGBT etc, but in terms of economics, she is doing a great work, we just need to see how well German economy is going
It doesn't matter what I choose because that leader would become corrupt after a while being around our parties
The person doesn't matter, it's the country that is completly rotten
I think anyone who isn't Orbán or the Polish PM (sorry, don't know the name) would be if not an upgrade, a sidegrade
And not just as an alternative to Sánchez, but to any of the leaders of the more prominent parties
They're all so bad
We in Spain trying to get rid of the monarchy while this fella wants to reinstitute it in Italy
Hey, the English are not going to lend their Queen to you, they are too in love with her, but you can take ours
> We don’t need more division in our society, it’s bad enough as it is
A little offtopic, but how's that
It seems pretty stable from the outside (especially when comparing to UK, the US and such)
I like Gezellig, that's a word that many languages lack, it's not exactly cozy
It's just Gezellig
From Spanish, I like the speed mostly, live in the UK and English is so slow
Also I'd say the huge variety of slang, British English is quite rich on that too
The speed and the thousands of slang words and ways of pronouncing words depending where you are from
The words/expressions we use to cuss, I just find them extremely funny
Ima add some history here
We have an equivalent to "asshole" which is *gilipollas*. That word contains our equivalent to "dick", *polla*. The word doesn't have a literal meaning regarding the dick, it's just the word
But AS IT TURNS OUT, it does mean something
In the 18th century there was a guy whose last name was Gil
He was a poor bourgueois and wanted to marry his two girls to the aristocracy
SO he dressed them up in beautiful dresses and taught them walking and manners, but the poor girls were so incredibly tight in these tiny dresses they couldn't even walk, so they walked in small steps and with stiff bodies, which people connected to how a chicken would walk
People just mocked Mr
Gil, he was a kinda ridiculous man and he spent loads of time showing off his poor kids in the rich neighborhood
Spanish for "chicken" is *pollo*, and it doesn't work in femenine (you get *polla*, which is "dick"), but people started to call his girls *pollas* as in female chickens
So when they saw them walking down the street, they said "Look, Mr
Gil and his dicks(pollas)", which translates to "El Sr
Gil y sus pollas". That got contracted until becoming the word *gilipollas
Massive use of subjunctive: Spanish has entered the chat
Real equality
Blood sausage (made with blood, rice, onion, leek and spices)
It's common in many countries I think but still considered disgusting by many tourists
In Spain we eat rice with sweet milk, it's like creamy we also add it cinammon or a biscuit
My family also love eating boiled snails with salt
In Galicia they eat any kind of sea food they are specially good at crustaceans like percebes, octopus, goose barnacles, lamprey in its blood, also in the north i think specially basques eat bby eels like if they were noodles
In the north of Castille we also eat blood sausages, fried hard bread, the bull tail, his testicles, ear pigs,tripe stew
In Catalonia they make calçots which is like grilled green onions or similar, i don't know which kind of vegetable it is really
I don't know were is from but my father loves pasta with squid ink and ink, i guess comes from Galicia because they also eat squid with ink
Bull tail, it's delicious but I understand the pro-animal arguments behind it
We have stew of tripes as well
We call tem *callos*, which is the same name we use for feet callus and that makes it even more disgusting
To give the whole thing more structure
Actually having tasted the riceless version (thos one was french) i preffer it with it
It is the filler
It gives structure to the sausage
There are some that are just onions or leek
it is for many people
I foind the broth of callos really good but I can't with the texture of teh callo itself
It's the one from Burgos that uses rice
Here in León we don't use rice in ours
Belgian food is good, tho
I'm studying in Burgos, here they have maybe the most famous morcilla ( the blood sausage), im not an exoert on it but i think they don't use any rice just blood, i ve heard in Leon they are traditionally made with rice so i guess we have many regional recipes
In my experience as a foreigner this feels true, and sadly most of this issues are a global trend
We've seen a demential increase in inequality as well, and the complete destruction of the labour movement and its accomplishments is going strong
París has more rainy days by far, I don't know if it is true but I heard that Disney didn't take it into account when deciding the location of disneyland in Europe and regretted it
Very common when written, but less common when talking
I mean, people use it, but "Vale" is still more prominent
Very common and widespread
Even my parents (in their fifties) and my college professors use it as a regular word
It's not common in speech, you'd normally use "vale" or "va", but it's not unheard of either
In written form it's a bit more common, often written as okay/okey/oki as "ok" is sometimes considered a bit curt, especially if written on it's own
Here in Spain is not  usually used in a normal conversation, we use "Vale" instead (it has more or less the same meaning)
However, a lot of people write "Ok" or "Okay" while texting
Very common
It’s usual to hear people saying “Ok” as “Vale” in Spanish, which means approval
Also at the beginning of a sentence: “Okay, voy a...”
I would say the opposite, it is used almost as much as the Spanish equivalent (vale)
Maybe the difference comes for our age-gap or less likely the place
I'm from Valencia (East Spain)
Ok can mean "bien" (good) when used as an adverb (*It was ok*), while ok as an interjection can mean "vale" (*Ok, I'll call you later*)
I buy that we use those expressions in a written way, but if I hear someone verbalizing oki, I denounce him to the Inquisition
Que cute ni que pollas xD
I was going to say that it is common to see it written (in messaging apps for example) but I think when we talk we keep using more the word "vale".
I'm from Madrid, nobody uses "ok", it'd sound ridiculous
I'd dare to say it's the standard reply when messaging, even for old people (60+ yo)
Well, here in valencia and murcia we do use it
I'm from Barcelona
"Ok" is everywhere, but when messaging it's like the default response
In spanish the same, "fin de semana"
I’d inform them that they’d have less than 20 years to sort their affairs and hightail it to LatAm, unless they want to die in war, or be executed
Kill the guy with the moustache
If the person was visiting from 1931, this is exactly what I would say as well
And while both of you are rightfully overwhelmed, a pissed man pukes in the background
And that will stay as it is now
So don't be moving the border during the night to reconquer it bit by bit again please
Shit, you got me with your over-complicated spelling
i would say that the history of Sweden or Portugal
I had always be amace that a country with that low population could form an empire that was that dangerous and had an active participation in important wars of Europe when almost all the countries around them wants to kill them (i identify with this one)
Also Portugal history seems pretty interesting, they where a countrie with one of the best navies and a good merchant structure that is often forgotten, also how they gain their independence from ""Spain"" multiple times
i talk abaut what we study, and honestly we study very litle abaut Portugal wich i think its a shame
and its a shame becouse specially that, becouse Portugal has many interesting things
That's certainly weird
well one of that we achieve it
almost 100 years so its not that bad
La Ciutat de las Arts y les Ciencies in Valencia has been used in multiple scifi tv shows and movies
The most recent one that I remember is the Season 3 of Westworld (it's the Delos HQ), the buildings were also used in Doctor Who, V, Tomorrowland, etc
Right now:
\- City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia
\- AZCA neighbourhood and CTBA in Madrid, looking forward to *Operación Chamartín* in the future
All three aligned to the main road of Madrid, the *Paseo de la Castellana*. Also, the [PAU de Carabanchel] features some interesting modern residential building designs
\- Distrito 22@ in Poble Nou neighbourhood, Barcelona
\- [Expo 92] in Seville
The finantial centers of madrid and barcelona probably
Although if i had to choose like one place it may be the ciudad de las artes y las ciencias (city of arts and sciences of valencia) because all tgose buildings are very futuristy looking
I'm pretty impressed by those pics
Definitely planning a trip to Hamburg as soon as this shitty health crisis ends
Also the buildings designed by Calatrava, like the [mall in Oviedo] or [the bridge in Bilbao] . They haven't aged well, though, as far as I know
That was going to be my reply too, although it is not a whole city, just a concrete place of a city
>La Ciutat de las Arts y les Ciencies in Valencia
That was what came first to mind but just to add some others:
Ciudad de la cultura in Santiago de Compostela
Centro cultural internacional Oscar niemeyer in Avilés
Correct me if I’m wrong, but in Azerbaijan I’m convinced it’s Qax
Both in Denmark and in Norway there are towns called "Å"
In the island of Lanzarote there is a small village called "Ye" and in Spain I don't think it gets any shorter than that
I've tried all the languages (speaking Catalan and Spanish) and I was surprised to be able to understand all of them
The most difficult was the Italian one, but because most of it was the argument of a DC comic book about "White Lantern" and it was very confusing at first
I could understand all of it anyway
Portuguese and French were also ok, one talking about an stadium, the other about a theater play
Finally, the Romanian one was surprisingly very easy to understand, at some points it felt like reading Catalan, it talked about some local movie called Felicia
Spaniard from Mallorca (I speak both Catalan and Spanish):
Romanian and French, I (think I) understand about 40-60% of the words, and it's enough to get the idea but I'm not sure if it means what I think it means
Italian and Portuguese, I understand about 70-80% of the words (maybe even more in Portuguese, like 85-95%) and I'm pretty confident in getting the overall meaning of the paragraph
Nice, all of you forgot about Galician
You are not invited for tea at my place anymore
*(Spaniard from Galicia)*
Spanish, Portuguese and French (I got an easy one) I understood all what was said
The French one I had to read it slowly
Then comes Catalan which I only ever hear and never read
It looks like a Spanish 7th grader's French homework that he did in 5 min
I understood everything but it took some re-read
Italian
I opened two and I could get the general idea but there where some words I couldn't figure out
Romanian
I understood nothing
I recognized some words but not enough to get the context of the paragraph without the photos and word in other languages of the article
My mother tongue is Spanish and I can understand Italian, Catalan and Portuguese, the French not
I only had problems with Romanian
Others I got 80-90% and deduced the rest by context
* French: could understand mostly everything
The article was about a scientist so a lot of similar words between both languages
* Italian: same
It was bout endometriosis so not a hard one
* Portuguese:  Lithuanian flag
Understod it easily
* Romanian: understood around 30-40%. It was about the Hubble telescope
* Catalan: 100% understood it
I'm not Catalonian but I'm kinda familiar with the language anyway
* Galician: Santiago de Compostela's cathedral, couldn't be more appropriate
100% understood it too
tl;dr: Understood easily most of them except for Romanian
&#x200B;
EDIT: I've studied three years of latin, three of French, and one of Italian
So that probably helped with it
I opened the Romanian article and could understand the basic outline of the article
It was about Anne Frank and a book containing her diary entries
The image portrayed an edition published in June 25th, I don't remember the year
Then it went on about dates and the content of the book, which is written in Portuguese (I think) and disserts about entries in Frank's diary
Pretty proud, Romanian is a cool language
Edit: misspelled language :(
Spaniard that moved to barcelona relatively recently here:
French: A musician, I can understand soooome things
It'd be an effort to make a word by word translation but I can understand the meaning of sentences
Italian: Another musician, I can pick out words here and there, but I have a harder time figuring out how whole sentences go
Portuguese: The easiest one by far, listening to protuguese speech still goes way past my head though
Romanian: The Y element in the periodic table, feels like half-way between french and italian to me
Catalan: A french town, I'd say easier than protuguese, although
I have been living in Barcelona for a couple months now
I intend to learn the language eventually but it's hard to balance learning Catalonian, then learning other more practical languages, studying for certifications in my career path, and actually working
Galician: Definitely also very close to spanish, if Catalan is half-way between Spanish and French, Galician is halfway between Spanish and Portuguese or so
The page is about a team of handball in Cantabria
&#x200B;
So honestly
If I were to order the languages by how easy they are to understand for me, I'd go Galician > Catalan > Portuguese > French > Romanian > Italian
FRENCH: Noah Bernardo Jr
Is the drummer from POD and second causin of the lead singer
He is also friends with the WWE super star Rey Mysterio
My wife is Chinese and her Spanish is not that great
We took a trip to Paris for a weekend and she was amazed that I could understand everything
I could understand basically all of them, it's weird, I don't know all the words but I still get the message and instead of reading it on that language badly, I just read it as if it was spanish on the go
Weird
I spent a fair amount of time clicking the "random page" until I got tired, I was on the page of some random skyscraper, so I went to the "skyscraper" page
Catalan: Perfectly understood, expected
French: 90% Understood
My French is very rusty and was never very good to begin with, but it's easier to understand written and I can geuss the meaning of many things due to context
Portuguese: Perfectly understood, expected
It's harder spoken, but written it's really similar to Spanish
Italian: I'd say 90% as well, but in general I understand much more Italian than French
Romanian: No clue
Maybe an isolated word
Latin: More or less 50%, I can reasonably understand what it's about
I'm from Galicia, so I understand perfectly Galician, Spanish and Portuguese
Catalan and Italian were easy to understand, but French
Of course, I can understand what it tries to say, but there are some words that are really different from other romance languages
Portuguese, Galician and Catalan: Very easy to understand, almost like reading Spanish with different spelling, especially for the first two
French: This one doesn't count since I learned it as a kid
Italian: I don't really understand the structure of individual phrases, but can sort of pick up the meaning of each one, so I get a general idea of what they mean through a couple of words of vocabulary
Romanian: it's a 50/50, I either understand the sentence rather well, or I would have understood it much better if it was in dutch lol
Half my family is Spanish and the other half is Italian/Canadian
One time my Zia Maria from Rome came to visit and her and my Spanish mother had full on conversations in their respective languages
With Spanish and Catalan, French must have been pretty easy
From what I understand Catalan is closer to French than Spanish
That's interesting, for me it's quite the contrary
I understand fine French, Italian or Portuguese but I have a very harsh time trying to make sense of Romanian
Maybe your knowledge of Catalan helps you more with that language
Argamasa means mortar and by extension a paste that glues two stones
I did the other way around
I understood about 50% but I had a difficult one about an oil company
I understood loose words, and knew the context but wasn't enough to understand it completely
Same happens to me with French
I guess the pronunciation of the two languages is too different
I find it funny how Spanish comes easily for most Romanians but Romanian seems hard for most Spanish speakers (except Catalonians, they find Romanian easy too)
Yes, knowing Catalan helps with French, but just with reading it, the French accent is too complex and different from the rest of the family, so it's almost impossible for me to really understand a conversation in French
Also Catalan helps with the understanding of the other romance languages too, for example it has a lot of common words with Italian that are not shared with Spanish, so at the end you can understand a little more of the text/conversation
Also as a side note (I'm not and expert) but I really think that Catalan is more similar than Italian than Spanish or French
I think that this morning I've been just lucky with the random entry, I've just tried it again now, and yeah, I can understand a lot of it, but this entry has a lot more of slavic words, and that's a no-no for me
LMAO probably opened Argamasilla, a small town south of Ciudad Real
>Gallego: a former province of portugal,
lmao
I always heard that Spanish was very easy to understand for Italians
Much easier than Italian for Spaniards
I wonder why it's like that
Anyway, in my own experience, I was always able to communicate with Italians both speaking our respective languages
I actually know a Romanian girl named after a character from a Telenovela
Never would have thought of that hahaha
"Baggins" is translated as "Bolsón" in Spanish, which means big bag
"Bag End" is translated as "Bolsón Cerrado", which means Closed bag
"Bard" is translated as "Bardo". Some of the hobbit surnames, the ones that refer to actual things are translated too: "Brandybuck" is translated as "Brandigamo".
The river Brandywine is called "Brandivino".
I actually prefer that they decided to translate all of these things, I think the way it's done mantains the feeling of familiarity and if they had keep the english ones it would have sound very foreign for the Shire, which it is a place that you are supposed to identify with
EDIT: Just adding another translation:
"Bywater", one of the villages near Hobbiton is translated as "Delagua".
Just to point out that Tolkien was a control freak and he personally supervised the translation to the names himself to Spanish, French and German, and probably some other languages
He wanted it that way because the names have some significance in being properly understood, and the characters are not speaking English to begin with in his fictional world
I'm not sure about this, La Comarca is the translation of The Shire
Hobbiton is just a village inside of the Shire
And in Spanish it is called Hobbiton aswell
I feel devastated
I visited Notre-Dame a year ago and I got so many beautiful memories from that
Notre-Dame is part of our global heritage
It's a tragedy for all of us
They might rebuild the damaged parts, but it's never gonna be the same thing
It can be rebuild, no one lost their lives, so it's not that bad
>	It’s actually forbidden in Germany to honk over inconveniences, it is strictly reserved for dangerous situations
Same in Spain
Nobody gives a fuck
I bet they also honked at you for taking roundabouts properly
That's cool
As Spanish I don't think that Madrid is particularly hated by Spanish people (Im Basque so I might be wrong)
With all the respect, british people have a lot of reasons to hate London
I don't blame them
I don't hear anyone hating on Madrid except maybe Barca fans (in a playful way)
Most people have visited Madrid before and I get the sense that it's generally liked
I think Lisboa is more hated than O Porto in portugal
Many Lithuanians told me that there's a bit of a battle between Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania
I don't think people dislike Barcelona besides the usual nationalist conflict
As some other pointed out, Madrid as a city gets a lot more hate
However, there is probably a greater (or at least louder ATM) degree of hate against anything Spanish nationalists perceive as "pro independent" or catalan - symbolic
So there is football hate, hate against the people, and even a hot hate for the language, shared among many of the regions in the Eastern part
I hope I helped you get a bit of a broader picture
Mmm
I would put the people of Madrid as right wingers
I would put Valencia but yeah
Might be
I mean, your ruler is the pope
The current one would be a benevolent dictator situation, so depending on how you view it, it might even be an improvement ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
Many people live in French towns near the Swiss border and comute to work in Switzerland
Swiss earnings with French expenses
In 2018, following the final verdict of the [Gürtel Case] which condemned the ruling People's Party to pay a fine for benefiting from the scheme, the opposing party PSOE registered a [vote of no confidence] in Congress
On the 1st of June 2018, the vote became the first successful one in the modern History of Spain, replacing the then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy with our current one, Pedro Sánchez
I wouldn't say quitting a month before elections is "collapse"
More like an electoral maneuver
I seriously doubt they would do that half term
In spain it happened in 2018 because the governing party was decleared a criminal organization by the judge bacause of corruption
Infamous suits better IMHO
Kids start learning English in school at 6-8 yo and stop at 16 or 18 yo, so it's kind of granted, but the level is quite low
Also, in regions with their own language (Galicia, Basque Country, Catalonia, Valencia, etc
) they also learn the regional language, so they have trilingual education
pretty impressive if you can speak english in spain
we are literally known for our terrible language skills
but the boomer generation was taught french in school so that’s still quite common
a lot of people speak french but no english because of this
Here we are still struggling to learn english
many have tried, but very few could use it on a fluid conversation
Nice-to-have asset that most people don't have
Although amongst people below 35 years old is kind of common to speak English (kind of common = 15-30% of the population)
Not really
It's more common for young people to speak English but it's not taken for granted
Some old people may speak a rusty French
I just wanted to confess that everytime I see a commenter with the UK flair I read it with The Closer Look's voice and accent and everything
same in spanish
They don't stop learning at 16-18 yo, at 16-18 yo it stops being mandatory to learn it, as you can change it for other classes, at least where I study
I'm sorry, pardon
WDYM italian people in rural zones barely speak Italian
I do get how, like in rural spanish zones, many will have a strong accent and will make common mistakes, which are due to poor/insufficient education
But even with that I wouldn't say they "can barely speak spanish" lmao
Yeah if you have an interest for English you'll probably find ways to continue your education, either through classes or consuming english/american media, but many people would just stop learning as soon as it stops being mandatory
yeah but only for a couple of years at a low level
We end mandatory education at 16, with a A2 level of English I believe, but if you wanna go to college you'll take another 2 years of education which grant you a B1
However, in practise most people will have trouble understanding spoken english, even if they speak slow and vocalize a lot
We'd have to take an extra interest and either have the money to take external classes or consume english/american media
My class did go to Ireland this one year, we were 16, and we were divided in groups of 2-3 to go live in a native family's house for the week
It was so bad
There were groups who didn't speak AT ALL with the family, apart from "Hi, thank you, good morning, I'm leaving". A friend of mine did ask the lady for a literal "DRYER MACHINE". She meant a hair dryer, the lady was so confused, and my friend ended up going to bed with her hair wet
Public education is still lagging in most aspect
yeah, they're excellent in getting people to science ans arts, but lacking in the matter of everyone knowing how to use a second language
The English level of most Spaniards is basically knowing a few words that they mash together with the typical structure of a Spanish sentence and pronounced exclusively with sounds found in Spanish plus one or two overly forced English consonants thrown in along the way
As you might imagine, going from 15 vowels and around 30 consonants to 5 vowels and under 20 consonants, knowing that only a small percentage of those phonemes are shared between both languages, does not work out very well
Same in Spanish: 'inglés macarrónico'.
Can confirm, the closest thing to a mandatory foreign language we get besides English is the option to learn French in highschool (at least in mine, but I think it was a trilingual school so
Same
Many old people in Spain spent decades working in France, like my own grandparents and some of my friends'. But I'm yet to meet someone who did so in Portugal
Funny how we're literally shoulder to shoulder and we have so little interaction
Where I study there are two types of class, bilingual and normal, in bilingual you have some classes like math in English and another class in French,like PE, if you are keep going to bilingual classes you will keep studying English
That's really interesting
I went to a pretty average high-school and we had the same situation
Same, never got the option to take Portuguese in highschool
Unless you're told to or given permission I'd say that'd be considered rude, yes
I like that the French have a culture of intellectualism
Be it philosophy or arts, I feel like the common French person is expected to have their own formed opinions about them, which creates a country where a higher form of discourse is possible
Portugal is so similar to my region of Spain (Galicia) and our languages have a common origin much closer than latin so we have a similar culture and can have conversation in our own native language
For France, its the food
a spaniard cant understand a portuguese therefore theres no mutual intelligibility and they are not the same language
Theres 89% lexical similarity between the two, but its probably around the same with Dutch & English
well i think most spanish cant really understand spoken portuguese at all
written down its much easier obviously
I'd say so, but i'd still consider a lot of the culture to be shared with Spain, specially when you visit other countries and see the huge culture difference compared to the "general" spanish culture
Probably
Obviously most of us feel closer to another spaniard than a brit or french, but some of us also feel closer to portugal than to Spain
Yes from the Galician Nationalist Bloc, but its really small right now
Peaked in the 90's
Either Albert Rivera or Inés Arrimadas
Everyone i know Hates them regardless of politics
The fucking thief we have for King
His father passed him the crown because of a corruption/love scandal and now during the pandemic there's been a shitstorm surrounding the family again
Those Bourbons never get sick of bankrupting Spain, so they must be kept out at all costs
Please NOT
NOT more politicians
our economy can no longer feed more parasites
You gave us the Boubons
It is already a tradition for you
Send them all here, then let me in and close the border forever
Aren't they just United Russia's puppet at this point
OK, but it has to be more than they embezzle
I mean, what's one more, right
Nononono, even for money, we can't accommodate any more politicians
I tell you a sad story: when I was in high school (14-15 years old) I had a teacher who was really worried about my classmates' lack of motivation to study
More or less half of my classmates aspired only to "work as a builder, you earn a lot of money and you don't have to study".Then, the crisis of 2008 came and the real estate bubble exploded
Do you know what all those useless bullies who just finished their compulsory education are working on now
THEY ARE POLITICIANS, everyone who hasn't found a job has joined a political party
(exaggerating in andalusian)
send help/hope/common sense/structural reform project of the economy
We already have our own Le Pens and Macrons
And we don't want more
Tye gender rule you mention is not applicable since I know
There are unisex names, for example Muriel
The Spanish rule that really friends my gears is one was dismissed a couple decades ago
No foreign names allowed
For example, I know a guy, English ascendants, is called Jon
Why
Jon is basque
John is foreigner thus forbidden
Ah, forget to mention guanche names, from canary islands
Anyone can tell me if chachiraxi is a male name or not
Chaxiraxi, Sibisse, Rayco, Xerach, Agoney
I live in Germany even tho I'm Spanish and became a father three months ago
I thought it would be cool to name my son after me (I'm named after my father too) so he would be "my name" III
Turns out it wasn't allowed so we gave him another name
Are Álex and Pau legally names
Pau is legal for a boy's name but I can image that you wouldn't be allowed to name a girl Pau and would have to go with Paula, same with Álex for both genders
Even though the administration may be lenient
I kinda like this naming rules it keeps the thing fairly simple and doesn't allow parents to experiment to much with a childs name
I would like to name my daughter “Drop table c_an_registro”
But I bet they won’t let me
Lol in the family of the boyfriend of my sister there are like 6 Jesus so no we dont have that here
(it seems like a tradition to them to call the first son Jesus dont ask me why)
Wait you're saying you can't name your kid after yourself
Yes, I registered my children in the Spanish consulate in San Francisco and they have to follow Spanish rules
So if I chose a ridiculous name for them in the USA, Spain would have made me choose a different one
Happily I knew and we chose normal names
In Spain, nowadays, you can name your child with foreign names, or even invented ones
But you must follow the rules
For example, Andrea is a girl's name in Spain and a boy's name in Italy
If Italian parents living in Spain want to register a baby boy name Andrea they will be asked to add another name to clarify it is a boy for example José Andrea
My father and his siblings have all three given names but all very Catholic and traditional ones so I guess that’s how they avoided the only two given names rule
If the actual surname is Messi, of course you can name your son Lionel
What you cannot do is to use Lionel Messi as given names: so not a chance to a see a Lionel Messi Pérez López or something like that
Pau, in Catalan, can be translated as Pablo (Paul) and Paz (Peace)
Both are very popular names in Spanish
Pau, for girls, is not short for Paula
I have always thought it is very creepy to name your child after their dead sibling
Yep, and as a teacher in the USA one thing that I hate the most is students getting angry because you misspell or mispronounce their names
Sorry, it's not my fault that there are 50 Kayla, Keily, Kaelya, Kaylea, Caitlyn, Caylin, variations
Yes, it is, it was explained on other comment, but the part I find interesting is that some are non gendered, and the others are unknown out of this specific region
But they are permitted in all the country, so it is possible to find a man called Chachiraxi (female name) in continental Spain because the officer didn't knew
Or a woman in Canary Island called Ganix, which is a basque male name
Also, Jose Maria is a male name and Maria Jose a female name
So Ganix Sibisse should be a male name, but Sibisse Ganix a female name
Who approves this
Who knows that
(One basque, one from canary islands)
My man
I know guys called Muriel
Myself am almost named Muriel, it is admitted as a male name
Or at least it was when I was born
Oooh no in chinese you have to carefully take into account the meaning of the characters
Very interesting
I meant if they are truly legal or if the administration just doesn't care
They not exclusive for one gender so they are technically against the law
try to explain to the police that it is your real name and that its pronunce Albin
Famous in 80s Spain too
Yep, English or creative names are very trashy in Spain
Wth
Obviously because Hebrew is as common in Catalunya as Cátala
I thought foreign names were not considered so they shouldn’t take it as foreign name when it means something in one of the two official languages
I'm sure most people from Spain will say [Museo del Prado] but to me it's either [Guggenheim Bilbao] or [MACBA (Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art) ]
I guess it depends on whetever you like more modern stuff or not
All of those are excellent however, very well maintained
I really enjoy modern art and the [Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía] (even better than MACBA, despite myself being from Barcelona and how stupid the Reina Sofía's name I think it is), but compared to Museo del Prado there's simply no competition
I would say no
However in my family we use English for that
I live in Madrid, so you might (maybe
) get more interesting answers from the bilingual regions of the country
I remember using it in Christmas when discussing about the presents
My stepfather used English and then french
I use english with my sister to prevent my mother from understanding
No we usually know more language than them but as a side note i dont speak french very well so my sister and mother that speaks french pretty well tend to speak in french in front of me to annoy me
Shit i need to recover my french lessons
It helps and we appreciate the effort even if it's very basic
I wouldn't mind at all
In fact I would be charmed, just try your best
That said among tourists, English (if they try to speak spanish) really do have a way of butchering our language
I think it's not their fault, their vowels just sound really strange in spanish and it translates into a very particular form of speech, which is hard to understand
Anyway it will always be seen as a plus, especially if we don't associate Spanish with your country
Oh, and if we talk too fast ask us to slow down, I wouldn't mind and it can really help
I feel good to see that someone wants to lear my language expecially if he/she its from our big brothers in the north
But you will also find people that will just make jokes on you and laugh on your face
All of u sound drunk af, except italians and Portuguese but the rest
My brother has been living in Norway for a couple of years and speaks Norwegian fluently
He gets so annoyed when Norwegians answer him in English because he looks "very Spaniard".
I'm always like 'moi, puhutko englanti
' Because even though 90% of the time they do, I'm used to moi-ying but don't want to jump from it straight to English
>where an old fellow demanded me to speak Catalan
Hahahahahaha
Not all Catalans are like that **AT ALL** you just found an idiot
You can find th anywhere
jajaja lol well the things there are special but i think that some people are nice to a broken spanish becouse we are know for our broken english
He uses it at work and has no problems, it is more when talking to strangers when he finds this problems
But I know there is no bad intention, but they just want to help him
Btw, Norway is such a cool country, and the few Norwegians I know are shy but lovely
50% of Catalans have Spanish as their native language
I don't want to get into a Discussion
You can check it in surveys made by Catalonia
Anyway, by this time almost everyone in Europe knows Catalan exists
>espanish
Accurate accent
>espanish
I see you're a man of culture
Probably so goes to show you how good my Finnish is
FML
Happy to hear
Well in spain there are diferent dialects and also you had to take into acount the american dialects so we are use to hear words that dont match with the rule in our zone
At least this is what i want to say
Nor good nor bad imo
I'm not arguing politics, I think you are
I brought to the table a fact backed by linguistics and estatistical surveys and you brought one backed by the constitution
The same one which considers valentian a language
and not a dialect of Catalan, against linguists consensus
As you can see I agree that Politics muddles the truth
However, my argument isn't political in the slightest, it's a number, and it's not a baseless afirmation
I'm not sure because it has been so many years
but IIRC the difficulty wasn't in not pronouncing "s" as "es", but to appreciate the difference in first place
Once you realise they're different sounds, if you keep saying "es" it's just due to laziness
No you are right
It is I who sucks
I'm not arguing
well, at least I'm trying not to
but you called my arguments baseless and political
I agree that Catalan is an official language of Catalonia as should everyone, because as you pointed out it is
it's also native to the region
And yeah, In that way it's native to catalonia
You're right
I just wanted to share a fact which I thought was relevant
Spanish is widespread in Catalonia even as a first tongue
As a Catalan has already said in this post: Catalan survival is in part dependant on non native speakers, which isn't a bad thing at all(We see this situation elsewhere, like in Belarus where the most spoken language is Russian, or Ireland where Irish is mostly and sadly an anecdote)
I think that's not the impression Catalonia gives the rest of the world, thus I wanted to share the number
It particularly struck me when I read about it
I though it was way more extended as a native tongue
But you're right this is getting a bit out of hand
I'll stop messaging, bye
According to Victoria Beckham, Spain smell like garlic
I don't think so
Victoria Beckham said Spain smells like garlic
Some people here didn't like what she said but I think they took it the wrong way since garlic smell is awesome
And ya, we have almost a bar per each 5 habitants so kinda makes sense
This makes me sad
Garlic smells amazing, I don’t see the problem
Garlic in olive oil, I'd choose this smell no matter what any random lady thinks of it
I would say holm oak, pine, ham and bread
Please, excuse my ignorance, I'm not trying to hurt any feelings
I knew some Germans who said kebab was from Germany, invented by Turkish inmigrants but they consider it German
I have always thought that it was from Turkey but I'm not really sure and they may be mistaken
I haven't been in Turkey yet to try your food that I've heard is amazing so I have little idea about kebabs in Turkey
B... But french fries are found all over the world
First time in London the airport smelled like hamburger in a really good way, I mean, I'm hungry just remembering it
Amazing and detailed explanation
Thank you very much
Siempre que vienen mis compañeros mexicanos a España, les invitan a toneladas de cerveza y hamburguesas pero me gustaría que les dieran jamón del bueno
El jamón bueno suele ser de entrante, sólo y acompañado con vino por ejemplo
También está bueno en pan tostado con aceite de oliva, un poco de ajo y tomate triturado
You just feel it in the villages
I'm from Aragon, one of the "oldest" regions in Spain, one of the "oldest" countries and you really see that even in the cities there are only old people
but if you hang out with your classmates and friends you might just don't realize
i live in a 20k town, the population is slowly decreasing year by year, young people flee to places with more opportunities, its all old people on the street (now not even that lol) and its a bit depressing
i saw some stat that thousands of villages were becoming unpopulated in Spain
I live in a region of Spain that has the same population density as Siberia, and we continue losing habitants
The government doesn't do anything and I'm sure my town will disapear in a hundred of years
The population is basically eldery people and studiants move to other cities to study at their universities, although we have one
On the good side, people from big cities come to our region to disconect with their busy lives and we have amazing natural monuments
I wish it was my case, at least we would have cheap houses, but in my case the town is getting bigger and more expensive while there is more competitivity to find jobs and the unemployment is raising now, with this crisis we will have 1 year with no jobs since we live off tourism so hopefully a lot of people will go back to their countries or native towns
I'll let you know when I can leave my house to see
Interesting
I get that you're talking about your town but France is one of the fastest growing countries in the EU, along with Ireland
Or any village in Spain
All the population is concentrated around Madrid, Barcelona, and the coast, where all the industry is
The middle of Spain is losing people (except Madrid)
I just realised now with the lockdown how many old people live in my neighbourhood
Before i saw more younger people because they were working, but now it's all old people + a few younger families
And my village only has retired people, and younger generations who go in the summer, but mainly old people
It shouldn't be legalized
Simply: it's a drug and I'm not in favor of drugs, any kind of them (medical issues apart)
I am totally in favour
Here, in Spain, almost everyone under 30 smokes weed or hash, be it daily or just at parties
We're also dealing with the mafia in Algeciras which has gotten a bit out of hand
On the economic side of it, I think we really need a new industry that can absorb the jobless farmers and give them a job
Also, our climate is perfect for cannabis and we could be one of the biggest producers in the world which would bring lots of money thanks to exports and taxation
I think there's way more positives to it than negatives and we could benefit from it more than we do from alcohol or tobacco anyway
Maybe we should ask why don't we prohibite tobacco and alcohol instead of legalizing more drugs
There are no soft drugs, all of them are dangerous and can destroy lives and community
EDIT: I expressed myself very badly
Check out below for an explanation (maybe you disagree anyways, but it is better explained)
Because those arguments are not really important
The only argument that should be of importance is personal freedom
Why the government should dictate what can I consume
There are more dangerous and harmful activities that are perfectly legal
As long as you're not harming others, you should be free even if you want to chop your leg
Why is pathetic
Why do you judge that people so harshly
Man, it's impossible to enjoy anything without someone else being annoyed by it when it has nothing to do with them
In order to not be an hypocrite, I imagine that you judge equally people on bars waiting in line to get a beer
I can be addictive, but in the same way of gambling or video games
Not like alcohol or heroine, which are physically very addictive, and if you're an addict you could die going suddenly sober
"Almost everyone", what a brave thought :D
I'd say that a good amount of people consume weed in Spain, it's very common, but not the norm
For me, the best argument for legalisation is personal freedom, I don't care about crime or economics, although those can be good points to convince the more backwards minds
Why should the government tell me what plant can I have or consume
At the very least, let me grow, carry or consume in peace
I'm not even asking for business selling it
Yes, and I wouldn't be bothered if it turns illegal too
Well, I said everyone under 30 has smoked at least once or if they are out, partying, and they get offered a joint, they usually take it
It's not even about personal freedom, I understand your point and I agree with it but it would be easier to convince those that are against by stating the economical benefits of its legalization
Medicines are not legal
The police didn't come to my house knocking to seize my lorazepan and I've never been searched and fined for carrying paracetamol
Guns are very dangerous and can be used to easily kill a large amount of people
But I'm all in favor for recreational use in safe environment as currently happens at least in my country
You can own a gun and use it on a shooting range, but licenses have strict requisites
I should be free to reasonably "harm myself" if that makes me happy
For example, eating in McDonalds every weekend
I'll happily pay my taxes to help others even if they have a bad diet or they want to drink alcohol
If I were such a cheap-ass should I be in favor of monitoring everything everyone does to make sure they don't take risk, so my taxes are lower
Should we ban football because here everybody plays it and it's a high injury activity
And we're not taking into account that very much like alcohol, cannabis can be consumed responsibly not making any long term harm with a moderate use
Which is how most people I know uses it
I remember thinking with like 10 years that portugal was just another region of spain
As a child I used to think that Germany and Italy were the same place, they're not even that close in name in spanish (Alemania and Italia)
As a child in the mid 90s I thought Baja California was part of the USA, Sinai was part of Israel, and Chechnya was an independent country
Also, every encyclopedia and dictionary in my parents house was bought in 1990 so it took a while to learn what the USSR was and that it was not around anymore
And regarding history, when I was a child the adults would talk all the time about "the war" meaning the civil war, but the movies would use "the war" to mean WW2, and nobody would explain anything
So I had a vague idea that there was one big ass European war in the early 20th century and that Spain was a combatant
When people talked about how Brits drive on the left I figured they drove primarily on the left side of the right lane, and didn't know why everybody made such a fuss about that
The idea of driving on the left lane was inconceivable to me
Also, I thought Charlemagne and Alexander the Great (Carlomagno and Alejandro Magno in Spanish) were the same person, and I was very confused as to why they changed the first part constantly
That's what right-wingers actually believe
Literally i was like "but why doesn't the weather man talks about pourtugal
Yeah, but I wasn't aware of that, to me Sinai just sounded like Biblical stuff and Israel did not register as a 'new' country
I found it more aesthetically pleasant
Baja in one side, Florida in the other
Besides, everytime something said America California would come next, so how could some part of California not be in the same country
The first time I saw a "disembodied" map of the US I was almost as disturbed as seeing an acquitance missing one arm
I first encountered the word Prussia in a childrens encyclopedia and instantly assumed it was a typo
Yes
Oh yeah, 3rd joke out of 4
Next is apache helicopter
Or "you criticise society yet you're part of it"?
Wait, is it "nazis were socialists, antifascists are fascist"?
The nationalism in Latin American schools is ridiculous
In the early Bruguera comics they used  to avoid references to the Spanish Civil War in order to prevent issues with the Francoist censorship
Whenever old people (like the "Abuelo Cebolleta") talked about *The War*, they used to talk specifically about distant wars, and the Franco-Prussian War was one of the favorites because it has nothing to do with the Civil War, but there is a *Franco* in the name
Of course, there are other references about Prussia in M&F, usually someone sitting on a Pickelhaube or stuff like that
Mister L. is the Superintendente Vicente, or el Súper
Bakterius is Profesor Bacterio and Ophelia is Ofelia haha
Tiffy I guess is Irma
The blonde super hot girl, right
That character is apocryphal, anyway
For some amount of time, Ibáñez wasn't the one doing the comics, Irma is a character from that time
But thanks to that the films had Irma
A small price to pay for salvation
Seville, Paris, Florence, Budapest, Istanbul
Here's an alternative:
Lisbon, London, Berlin, stockholm, St Petersburg
Another alternative:
Barcelona, Brussels, Rome, Viena, Krakow
And Another:
Madrid, Edinburgh, Napoli, Copenhagen, Prague
But really, the one that makes most sense to me IS:
London-paris-berlin-budapest-istanbul
All amazing cities i can Talk for and pretty much in a line
Feel free to change Budapest for vienna if you're feeling classy or prague if you want a fairytail (i just can't Talk for those because i haven't seen them
yet)
Lisbon-Seville (yeah seville is much more beautiful than barcelona or madrid)-paris- Rome- Amsterdam
Barcelona, Paris, Rome, Vienna and Athens
All of them are beautiful and have history
They all have airports, as far as I know, so traveling from one to the next would be easier
They're also all on the mainland, so with enough time, it would be possible to drive to each of them and see the countryside on the way
They tend to have good weather too
Anyway, there's a lot of cities in Europe that are just as good as those ones, so it's just my personal preference
Using just train literally removes from the equation south Europe and you would just visit the most homogeneous parts of Europe
I guess
Catunambú is my favorite
A lot of bars and cafes have it and it's by far the best of the commonly available coffees here
Their regular beans (not torrefacto) have a lovely light roast to them that gives a smooth and mild flavor and lots of oils
I describe it as kind of floral
It seems like dark roasts are all the rage lately, especially with the Starbucks coffees, but I really do prefer a medium-light roast
No burnt or bitter notes
Since it's roasted in Sevilla it's reasonably fresh when I buy whole beans which is a big plus
Not same-day but same-month
I used to live in Hawaii, where there are lots of small coffee farms growing some of the best, and also most expensive (Kona Coffee) in the world
It's a bit fruiter than your average coffee, but it's been years since I drank it so I'm struggling to remember all the details, other than that it was excellent
In my normal life, I go frequently to a little cafe in Madrid called [Mision Cafe] They serve [Hola Coffee] a small local roaster from Madrid
Spanish coffee is typically quite bitter, since they roast the beans with sugar - a byproduct of the days when coffee was in short supply, they used to cut it with extra sugar to increase the weight
I have tried a lot of high end cafes around Spain, Europe, and Australia (surprisingly snobby about their coffee) and this is on par with the best cafes I've found elsewhere, I'm sure it's due to both the skill of the baristas and the quality of the coffee
If you're ever in Madrid, give it a try
They also have the BEST napolitana (pan au chocolat) I've had anywhere on the planet
disclaimer: I don't work for them, just a fan ;)
Well I just broke with my French girlfriend
With the virus going on, we won't be able to see each other until the next year, so we decided to stop it
Dating someone from another country is a great experience
It's different and exotic
Even if you have the same things in common, the cultural factor means that it will be differences
Communication might be a problem
But it's part of the experience
You won't have trouble trying to explain something no matter how bad you are in the language you use
English is usually the way to go, but it has the feeling of whatever language the other person speaks
The words and the way of speaking use in his/her country will be translated in English making conversations very "colourful".
It doesn't feel the same as dating someone from your own country
And once you try, you won't want to go back
It's something that can't be explained easily as it has too many small details that make it special
I dated a german girl for 2 years
Sometimes I regret breaking up since it's the person I've connected more with but it was very complicated
First of all because when we were with her friends and family I wasn't able to interact because I didn't know German and I didnt' like that they felt forced to speak English, same happened with my family and friends, plus some of them aren't even fluent in English
We also had the problem of where to live, we visited each other, one month she'd come, one month I'd go to Germany, it was cheap with Ryanair but it didn't feel like a true relationship
Finally we broke up and I miss her sometimes but life is hard and full of obstacles, you have to keep moving
Sobremesa is a magical word that links family lunch with dinner
In Spanish year and anus are pronounced and written very similar, Año(Year) Ano(Anus) and to top if off natives don't really know how to pronounce the letter ñ, which makes for hilarious conversations "Yo tengo 20 anos" I have 20 anus
A teacher of mine once heard a British girl in a bar ordering an "ensalada de polla" When trying to say "ensalada de pollo" Which means chicken salad, instead she said something like "dick salad"
A friend of mine was learning Spanish (English Native), and whenever he messed up he would say “Estoy embarazado” meaning to say he was embarrassed
Not knowing of course that he was instead saying he was pregnant
When you try to say año (year), but because you can't find the Spanish n, you say ano (butthole)
Basically yeah
In Spanish (estás comiendo/comes) and French (tu est en train de manger/tu manges) as well
The most haunted place in Spain is a small town called Belchite
During the spanish civil war (1936-1939) there was a horrific battle in Belchite that destroyed most of the town, leaving only skeletons of the houses
It is said you can record cacophonies and hear voices at night
Oh and, while the ruins still remain, a huge part of the town was rebuilt and there's people who live there
There is a [really creepy palace] in the centre of Madrid that was built over the ruins of a burned convent and seems to be empty most of the time
Legend says every now and then you can hear inhuman screams if you get close enough
Nuevo Belchite is next to the ruins, tho
It wasn't rebuilt
The ruins were left by the Francoists as a remainder of the war
It's also said that Satanic groups go there to do their rituals as it's a place where many people died, but I doubt it since it's kinda touristy and rght next to the new houses of Nuevo Belchite
Wow, that's the shitties wiki article I've ever seen about something that's actually important lol
I didn't know that, but thanks for the info
Every place where a lot of people dies is considered haunted
I'm reading the comments and
I lived in the UK for two years and I was constantly saying "fuck" and "fucking", even at work and stuff
fuck
Don't you mean no one would give a fuck
In Spanish only vowels can form a single letter word
Consonants need a vowel, so only two letters at least if so
There are:
A (to)
Y/e (and)
O/u (or)
In Galician is mostly the same
Only vowels
A (the, to)
Á (to the)
E  ( and)
É (he is)
O (the)
Ó (to the)
U (where
usually used only as u-lo: where is)
a (to)
o,u (or)
y, e (and)
*a =* to
*e =* and (if the next word begins with hi- or i-)
y = and
*o* = or
*u* = or (if the next word begins with ho- or o-)
A (to), y (and), e (and when followed by a word starting with I), o (or), u (or when followed by a word starting with o)
y (and), a (to)
Yes
y, o, a.
Spanish is quite similar:
a - to
y - and
o - or (when the following word doesn't start by "o")
u - or (when the following word starts by "o")
FYI in spanish we say "es" (is) and "ellos" (the, plural masculine), so those doesn't count here
Cómo explicas "c mamo"?
You've got u, but you forgot e.
Hahaha, first time I see it
Mexican slang
Mostly as "q tal", and q is not a word
C mamo jjkajsjajja
In Spanish /e/ is like /y/ but when the next word starts with /i/, to avoid repeating the sound
So you would say "Pedro y Pablo", but "Pedro e Ignacio".
That means in Spanish every vowel *sound* can be a word just by itself
Pretty cool
Totally right
I'm ashamed I forgot it
Not i
I was sick some months ago xD
Maybe I was not paying attention xD
I meant counting "y" as "i". Focusing on the sound of the vowel
I personally don't see it as rude, but discussing salaries feels kinda intimate, like discussing your sex life or your relationship problems
So asking an acquantance detailed questions about money feels invasive (you can ask more open-ended questions if you are tactful)
My dad, my siblings and I discuss these issues quite openly (we have to be a bit more indirect with our mom though), and also with our friends
But a lot of people don't like discussing money
My parent's generation was all about "how can cousin Jorge afford that Mercedes
", you know, judging too much, and tended to be more private about their income and wealth
Younger people are generally a bit more open (among friends)
I'd say it depends on the situation
There's cases where you might talk about work and mentioning your wage makes sense
Mentioning out of nowhere *might* be considered rude, same for asking for it for no reason
And it goes without saying that bragging about your wage is pretty rude
People do not talk often about their wages, which I think is bad for workers
Knowing how much your colleagues or other people earn gives you the idea about how much should you earn, and if you are earning less than that, demanding it
This secretism makes employees earn less than they deserve
Completely agree with you
we produce lots of both
I'd say the standard are the green ones but then there are so many subdivisions and types I dont even know
I think people don't know olives are black or green depending on the moment they get picked from the trees and processed
olives get darker when they are riper so you get green olives if you pick them before they are ripe and black olives if you pick them when they are ripe
then they get even darker when they get processed
I only see black olives in pizza
Green olives are everywhere in Spain
As it's already been said, green olives are the most common here
However my favorite by far are some purple, reddish bitter olives
They are pickled, and are always made "crushing" them, they are cracked but still have the pit
I don't know their variety or even if they are common anywhere else, but they make me crazy
Since stuffed olives have also been discussed, a regional (i think) delicacy are "[kimbos] or "aceitunas follás" (fucked olives)
They are stuffed with a small pickle (the most common ones here, cornichons) and the flavors fit so well together
I love pickles and fermented foods, and olives are definitely a gateway
That's sounds interesting
Never thought about olives with almond
The two typical fillings here are anchovies and red or hot pepper
Not true
Black and green are almost equally popular
There are tons of varieties here in Spain with different flavours and you can get either color in any supermarket
Yes, they are actually the most common type of stuffed olives in Spain (and probably Portugal)
The flavour is not too strong though, it is a kinda marinated salty anchovie paste
It doesn't taste to raw or fresh fish
These are my favourite, I hate dealing with the olive's pit
And if it's with the pit I love the gordal variety, yum
Bilingualism is a common practice
Spain has several languages with legal and co-official status in specific communities:
* Basque, co-official in the Basque Country and northern Navarre
* Catalan, co-official in Catalonia and in the Balearic Islands
* Valencian (variety of Catalan), co-official in the Valencian Community
* Galician, co-official in Galicia
They are widespread enough to have daily newspapers and significant book publishing and media presence in those communities
In the cases of Catalan and Galician, they are the main languages used by the Catalan and Galician regional governments and local administrations
A number of citizens in these areas consider their regional language as their primary language and Spanish as secondary
In Spain there is a main language (Spanish) and then 3 other "big" languages (Catalan, Euskera, Galician) and a lot of not so spread languages
Everyone understand Spanish, 100%, but some have lost some fluency while speaking since they don't use it very often
In my case I learnt Catalan as my mother tongue and I started learning Spanish through TV, movies, music, etc
Then when you're 4 years old you start taking at least 4 hours a week of Spanish at school and at 8 years old you're fluent (mostly because of TV and movies, not gonna lie)
Nowadays Spanish is more used on the streets than when I was young, I was born in 1987 and NOBODY spoke Spanish on the streets back then when I was a kid, nowadays maybe 30% of the population speaks Spanish since we recieved a lot of inmigration from other countries that obviously learn Spanish instead of Catalan (and latin americans have it as their native language) and from the rest of Spain
in my region of spain most people are fluent in both languages we have, Galician and Spanish, but also because they are closely related
You also need galician for government positions in galicia, catalan for catalonya, basque in basque country
just a basic exam tho i think
In galician schools some teachers speak spanish and others galician
Education:
The galician and the castillian teachers have to speak those respective language in their classes, but outside of that its free choice for the teachers
I assume its the same way in basque country and catalonya
You start getting galician as soon as you get castillian classes at school
and everyone can understand each other fine speaking spanish throughout spain ofc, hell we can even have basic conversations with portuguese people if we ask them to slow down
(Spain)
For Spain it is kind of difficult to give a single answer
As others have pointed out some autonomous communities have their own official language alongside with Spanish
It is taught in school, and a basic knowledge of it is necessary for running for office or work as a public servant
Their actual use is a much more complicated matter
It depends on lots of things: roots (immigrant or not), who you use to hang out with, political affiliation, area, social position and many more that also can be specific to that region
My experience is limited to Navarra and Valencia, but I'll only talk about the latter since I don't speak Basque
Valencian is the name given to the Catalan dialects spoken there
There is a deep rooted and very complex identity conflict concerning this topic, so I won't make things worse, you can look it up
As for the use of the language, I would say its days are numbered
Yes, it is taught in schools, and required to access the regional administration
But unless you were born and raised in a Valencian-speaking family in a town were it is actively used by the majority, chances you will actually use it are slim
Valencia (city), which concentrates most of the population and economic development has been deprived of the language since the start of the 20th century, with this phenomenon intensifying drastically during the dictatorship(s), so immigrants from other parts of Spain didn't have any incentives to learn it or use it and elites abandoned it's use so the social role models were Spanish monolinguals
Most of Valencian spoken in the city is actually "reintroduced". Also many people complain that it is necessary to access public jobs (I mean, what did you expect), but the exam (I took it) is a total joke and many public servants rarely know how to speak it
Add to this the fact that during the first years of democracy valencians inherited a terrible division between full Catalan independence including Valencia as part the same nation (Fuster) or closeted fascist and other right wingers advocating for keeping Valencia free from anything that had something to do with Catalunya, but actually siding almost always with centralist spanish nationalist rhetoric and you've got the current situation
Only time will tell, but sadly I see it disappearing in a couple generations
It might not be the same but in Spain there are many secondary languages
Usually people can speak both of them or at least understand them
Spanish is more widespread in big cities while rural areas tend to use secondary languages as their main
In the case of Valencia, as I've already mentioned before, people switch constantly between Spanish and valencian
You might speak mainly Spanish with some friends while valencian with others
If someone talks to you in one language you reply with the same one
There are of course people that don't follow social etiquette and will only speak in the secondary language even if you don't understand it but thankfully they are a small minority
The chances of this happening increases in places like catalonia for example, where they use it much more and the language policy is stricter
In a nutshell Spanish is the language that people use for everything but secondary languages are more usen for socialising and interacting with the culture
Edit: We all start learning it at school
Some subjects are in the secondary language
Once you go further from primary education it starts decreasing as your studies improve
As the concepts you learn become more complex and specific subjects slowly focus on Spanish
Usually one year you might have one subject in valencian and the next year its in Spanish
The closest you are from finishing your studies the less valencian you will see until you will only learn it on one subject (which is valencian studies)
You can also do proficiency exams just like you do for any other language
Despite sounding quite useless as it is worthless once you move away from the region, it can give you an advantage if you want to work in the public sector
Isn't Balear a recognised variety of Catalan like Valencian
Kids do (because at school at least 30% of the hours are in those languages, and often more than 70% of the hours are in catalan where I live, so they have no choice), but adults don't, they just speak Spanish because it's enough
The use of the language outside of the school depends on the person, I had a colombian girlfriend 10 years ago, she moved to Spain when she was 13 and at 15 she spoke perfect catalan, no accent, just like a native, her brother, on the other hand, only 1 year older, and I've never seen him speaking Catalan, he understands the language but he doesn't use it
Of course each school/institution can choose how the language will be applied
Also Basque country and catalonia integrate the language more on the studies as they have stronger language policies
Studying on a public or private place also tends to affect, with public schools having more focus on the secondary language than private ones
I wrote based on my experience which might now be very accurate regarding other regions
Thanks for the insight
Any romance language is easier for me since for a lot of words I have 2 roots
Example: "To want" in Spanish is "querer", in Catalan "voler". I have both roots so when I read italian "volere" or in french "vouloir" I know the meaning of the word while another spaniard that only speaks Spanish would have troubles understanding it
It's not hard to read and understand the overall meaning of a text written in a romance language, listening and understanding what you hear is a complete different thing though
French is harder than Italian or Portuguese for me, but it's true that French has a lot more in common with Catalan than with Spanish
The problem with french is that it's not written as it sounds, and when they speak, they do it so fast, but if they speak slowly and clearly you can notice that catalan is very similar
They used to when I was a kid, but nowadays parents drive their kids even if they live in the same street where the school is
Stupid paranoia
Depends on the city and even the neighbourhood
I didn't take the metro to the city center alone until I was 15 myself, but I can see 12-13 year olds there alone too
Not any more
In the 90s, when I was a kid, we went everywhere alone from a very young age, even to the beach, which can be potentially dangerous
A few decades of famous cases of missing or murdered children have instilled in society a fear of leaving kids alone
Now it makes parents look irresponsible, in my opinion overprotecting our children is not good either and makes them spend more time at home because they can only go out when their parents or grandparents have time to go out with them
Spain: it obviously depends on where you live
I grew up in Madrid and started going to school on my own from 11-12 years old approx (1998-99)
It was either a 30min walk or a 15min bus ride
I could go down to the park and play around my neighbourhood without parents at 10 years old
However, whenever we visited the village my family are from, I could be out on my own from age 8 or so
Everybody knows you there, very little danger aside from cars, and there aren't that many as in the city
Spain has a lot of different contexts
But, I used to walk to the bus stop to wait to the school bus since I was 6 yo
Everyone did
Damn, I wish I had a helicopter parent
Not everywhere though
I think that's more or less limited to Catholic schools were parents live farther from the school and go to work to the area
Maybe some people do that but lots of children walk by themselves
>drive their kids even if they live in the same street where the school is
That only happens if they're going to work immediately after so they drope the kid in their way
I think in cities is normal once they are 12 or 13
In small villages they usually start way early
I agree
I went alone to the bus stop since I was 6, and I used to play alone with other kids in the street since I am
Always
Of course, adults was watching over us, but not necessarily all the parents at anytime
I don't think walking your small kid to school is overprotectiveness
Specially because of the traffic
Children are allowed to go around 10-11 years old and usually do it in groups
At least in my city
There are some schools near my college so I see them everyday
What I noticed is a trend of parents leaving their child by car before going to work or because they live a bit far away
They're very annoying and always end up creating a traffic jam of sorts around schools because they all have to leave the kid at the door like if they couldn't walk 2 minutes
This specially happens in private schools
Well, as a Spanish-Catalan speaker, I can understand only a few words in Latin (maybe up to 600-700
), and most words and sentences from Medieval Spanish (1200-1500)(sample text from [here]
Now, I've been looking for a few minutes for Arcaic Spanish (time is being debated, from 800-1000(?), to 1200) texts and I haven't found any sample text, sadly
I've read it's poorly documented, so that's not cool
The fact that I speak Catalan is important, because this language has been more traditional with Latin, compared to Spanish
Same with Spanish
Our languages are not THAT old, during the time of Al-Andalus they didn't even exist and they were actually born during the "Reconquista" from other languages that descended from Latin
In Spanish there are some that most of Spanish speakers do even when they are already quite fluent
Right off the bat, I can think of:
"People is" instead of "People are"
"Lose the train/bus" instead of "Miss the train/bus"
"Dream with" instead "Dream about"
"How is/are he/she/they" instead of "How he/she/they is/are"
I am sure there are others
We also make/do photos (*hacer fotos*), while you can take/get a photo too in Spanish (*sacar una foto*)
Same in spanish here it's "actualmente"
Yeah, I think we're on the same boat
Our word for it is *divertido* (*divertida* if it's a female word)
My teachers hated when we said "those are mineS" in Spanish you say esos son mios
Another one is the whole person vs people thing that  I still can't get right
Similar thing in Spanish, but slightly different
I used to make that same mistake quite often when I first started learning English, but I didn't quite understand why, since in Spanish we use a neutral possessive for both  "his/her" (su hermana, su hermano)
BUT when the subject or the complement are in plural, it is clearer: if the subject is plural, but the complement is singular, the possessive remains singular, whereas when the subject is singular and the complement is plural, the possessive becomes plural (sus), showing that the possessive does indeed need to agree with the complement, and not the subject
English has it backwards :p
It is even clearer when using "hers" and "his". In this case, it is obvious that what matters in Spanish is the complement
_Sacar una foto_ would translate directly as to take *out* a photo, wouldn’t it
The direct translation of the English _take_ a photo would be *tomar* una foto, which I have never heard
I'd say *sacar* is more like take out
I assume it comes from the old polaroid-like cameras
Would you consider the sentence "the police is trying to find the perpetrator" incorrect
Ok, thanks :)
Spending 40 minutes talking with someone in english online only to realize that he is spanish and never speak to him again
This happened about ten years ago when I was in Dublin visiting a friend for a week
My friend was working, so I took my time to explore the city on my own
It was lunch time one day, and I had eaten at typical Irish places the days before, so I decided to just go to an Italian restaurant for a change
I saw the waiter, and he looked like a freaking red haired Harry Potter with an Irish accent
While I was reading the menu, I noticed that all that the dish names were in Italian, and I contemplated three options to place my order:
* to use a Italian accent for the names of the dishes
* to guess how Irish people say the Italian dishes with the risk of ridicule
* to follow the usual Spanish pronunciation of Italian dishes and hope for the best
Finally, I decided to go for a (unintentionally bad) Italian pronunciation
After all, the waiter worked at an Italian restaurant and he should be able to understand me
I started to say what I wanted to order when the waiter interrupted me:
* *Espera, espera, espera
¿Eres español
* (wait, wait, wait
Are you Spanish
* Sí... ¿Tú también, no
(yes, you too, right
* *Sí, soy de Galicia, si quieres dime qué quieres en español y ya está* (Yes, I'm from Galicia, you can just tell me what you want in Spanish if you prefer)
He was very helpful and he didn't make me feel bad about my misunderstanding, in fact we both laughed
Why do foreigners like the macarena so much
That song hasn't been played in a Spanish party in several decades
It's like granny music here hahaha
>Give joy to your body Macarena
(meaning that she has to keep dancing gracefully, I guess)
>Your body is made to be given joy Macarena
(basically that she's hot)
>Give joy to your body Macarena
>Heeeeey Macarena Aha
I think that sums it up
If you want a full translation tell me
I'm bored and it's always good to practise translating texts
even if it's the Macarena
Yes, it's a mild sexual reference
I'd say al least 80% Spanish songs have mild indirect sexual references like that one, maybe more
Thanks, I'll do
Here we have a national ID and if you make your diligence it can work to make bureocracy online
[Here is a picture of the latest model]
Most curious thing is that i has the parents' names in the back
Yes, and it's pretty useful since you can travel wherever you want in Europe without anything else than your ID
It says your name, city of birth, day of birth, gender, address, signature, father and mother's name and your identification number
It looks like this:  [
In Spain we have a "DNI" (Documento Nacional de Identidad/ National Identity Document)
On it is the info of where on Spain were you born, your full name and birth date as well as a number followed by a letter which can be used to determine the veracity of the number
And Spain
I'm always a bit creeped out by how important your personal number is, yet it only has one random character
Like, if you upload a picture of your birthday, anyone instantly knows 95% of your personal number
Am I mistaken
Do people in Sweden worry about this
[Here is the non cropped version
So I don't know if the Canary Islands are just weird but I've never seen one of those, everyone just uses that big old green residencia paper
No, parents' names it's something that basically never appears on forms
The exceptions I know are the family booklet and your education booklets from primary and secondary education
That has to go with special discounts for travels of the islands
In Spain we must carry two surnames, one from the mother's family and one from the father's family
Cool
Thanks for the comprehensive answer
Not true, I'm in uni and I have to fill at least 2 forms with my parents' names per year
I guess it depends on which forms
I had never had to fill in my parent's names in any forms, let alone in university, where the forms I filled in had the regular stuff: name, surnames, full adress, DNI number, the usual things
IIRC: Seville, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid
As a trivia, Barcelona got a bigger population than Madrid in the 1930s.
For Spain It would be: Seville, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid and Madrid
In 1900 Barcelona had almost the same population as Madrid (and It would surpass It for a few years) and lisbon was just behind Seville in 1600 ( and would greatly surpass In following years until the independence of Portugal)
The rest were pretty clear cut
Madrid has been the biggest one for the longest time
Granada or Sevilla may have been bigger during the XIV-XV centuries
That looks like a tonguetwister
He, we also had Naples in the top ones
If we are including Lisbon we should probably check Naples, Milan, Ghent
as well
I thought it was Flensborg, are you sure
Yeah, naples would beat seville in the 1600 by a lot
Good point
I have no idea
DF had less than half million people in 1895
I wouldn't say I speak English well, but it's going to be easier if you watch and read content you like
Don't read and watch for the sake of reading and watching, you'll learn in the process
You're on the right path now, don't worry
I learned the basics at school, but 80% of my knowledge comes from watching subtitled shows and movies
At some point I realized I wasn't even reading the subtitles and was able to understand everything
I was sent to a bilingüal school since i was 3 and was mostly fluente by 6-7
To mantain certain level y stay on Reddit and try to watch shows in english
My school pushed languages hard so we started at 3 yr old
I started English lessons when I was eight, at school
When I was 17 and 18 years old I also had a secondary English subject called Practical English, which was focused on improving speaking, listening and conversational skills
In my third year at university I made a German erasmus friend who came to my class and we usually communicated in English with each other
I improved my reading and writing skills a lot since i use social media in English (mainly YouTube and Reddit)
Also through memes
I'm Spain it's possible as well, I think it's called the Seneca program so you can do both an Erasmus and a Seneca
It've only known people from Canary islands doing it to spend a year in the mainland though
That's because your uni puts English as the required language to apply instead of Greek and people think that they can expect English lectures
In Athens is the same
People could stop going, but I guess that Greece and Cyprus are still attractive in spring
I've never seen any option in Greece when I had to choose my destination, which personally is strange
I expected Greece to be a great place for Erasmus
Sure, but the thing is that most universities *require* you to have at least B1 of the language of teaching to even apply
Universities in Greece and Cyprus seem to have chosen not to require Greek in order to get more exchange students, which is fine as long as the student knows it and want that, as you said
I cant really tell italians or portuguese from average spaniards
I can kinda tell that if somebody is really pale they might be nordic or british or that if they are blonde they're prboably not from southern europe
It can be difficult but after living for some time in Poland I distinguish Polish features (eye shape, for example) quite easily
Surprisingly, yes
I think its really easy to spot people from countries such as Germany, the Uk, Belgium, Nt, and even some balcanic countries
Same goes for Spaniards in another country
Last time I visited Edinburgh castle the only thing I heard was a group of Spaniards yelling super loud
One of them was crying because reasons
I live in a tourist town
You can see the British and northern europeans from a mile away
With French, spanish and Italian i can't tell the difference
General idea: you can't. However there's cultural cues, do they have a deuter backpack
Do they wear sandals with socks
How do they sound
Do they move their hands a lot
How tall are they
There's not a simple rule, it comes from experience
There's so much appearance variation in many European country, you'd be lost without culture
For example, you may picture a spaniard as dark haired, dark eyed and short, but
it's not gonna work,  because we have plenty of blue eyed, blonde, tall gals and pals
Same goes with Italy and Portugal
Sometimes
It is mostly the combination of clothes, mannerisms and then looks, but it is mostly based around stereotypes
Some people already mentioned Dutch cause in average they are much taller in comparison to other countries
Some might say, they are preparing for the rising sea levels ;) French people tend to have in more often curly or wavy hair and have a pretty elegant style
In general I never try to assume
We use the same trick here, bonus points if they are heavily sunburned
Loud with dark hair, dark eyes and litre sized beer, those are spanish
Yeah the difficult part comes when you have to set them apart
Without language it's much trickier than one would think
> I cant really tell italians or portuguese from average spaniards
Came to say this
Of course this is a game I play when visiting other places, but Italians and Portuguese are indiscernible from the average Spaniard to me
They get me every time
Same with southern france
I feel attacked when it's said that Spaniards are loud but
it's just true
A look
An English friend once told me how easy is to spot the Spaniard in a pub
All you have to do is search for the loudest, fastest speaker of the room
Leonardo de Caprio has German roots and Austrian and Germans, depending on the region can have a very similar phenotype
But I think I know what you mean, a lot of Austrians have pretty full cheeks
In my experience Austrians are already a bit darker than Germans
Where I come from, few people have blond hair
For example my dad sometimes gets mistaken for a Croatian in the summer
Austria is a bit of a special case, cause we are a melting pot for a lot of different heritages
I think the most defined types come from the mountain valleys, which were pretty isolated for a long time
Reduce your meat consumption to a couple of times per week and use reusable containers and bags
Try to buy things that are made to last, and take good care of them
Don't buy things you don't need
Those are the basics, I think
Some of my favorites that may not have an exact equivalent:
- "A buenas horas, mangas verdes" literally "in good time, green sleeves".  It is used when something or someone arrives so late that it is no longer useful
It refers to the "police" of the 15th century, who dressed in green and used to arrive late (funny)
- "Poner una pica en Flandes", "to take a long spear to Flandes" (I don't know if that's the right name in Dutch),  is an expression used to indicate that something very complicated and expensive has been done and it is also a milestone
As you can imagine it has its origin in the war with the Netherlands, because sending the Tercios there was very expensive and difficult
It is used less and less, but this type of phrases with a historical background, I love it
My own favourite in Spanish: "nunca digas de este agua no beberé ni este cura no es mi padre", which translates as "never say from this water shan't I drink or this priest is not my father"
In Spain we have "matar moscas a cañonazos" (to kill flies with canon shots) that basically means that something is an overkill
I don't know if this one is already been said but there's this Spanish one that always amuses me:
"No tengo el chocho para farolillos"
Literally: 'My pussy isn't ready for little lanterns'
What it means is "I'm not in the mood for (your) bullshit"
In English Flanders
In Dutch Vlaanderen
In Spain, for heavy rains we say "caen chuzos de punta" (there are lances falling tip first")
In Spain it is similar: "Don't make a mountain out of a grain of sand"
We have hablando del rey de Roma (por la puerta asoma), talking about the king of rome (thought the door he comes) the last part isn't usually said as it isn't really necessary to understand it
Really
I've never heard of it
Where do you use it
I use "llueve a cántaros", which literally means "it rains like pitchers"
In Galicia we say it quite a lot
It also developed into the verb "chuzar". A chuzo was a short lance used in the navy, and in Madrid it was carried by the serenos
I've heard it plenty of times in Catalonia and València, although I doubt it's original from there
So cool
Maybe I'm too young to know, but at least I know what the serenos were
Maybe I'm just too young
The Royal Spanish Academy ( [RAE] ) is an organization composed of experts (academics, writters, journalists, scientists) that study how the language is actuakky being spoken
how real people speak it
There is one in every single spanish speaking country and they all come together as equals every few years and make the dictionary together
it is muuuuuch more democratic than oxford deciding they are the best at english and people saying "ok yeah I guess". That's why spanish is such a clean language, it gets updated every few years
In my country Galicia we have the [Real Academia Galega] :\^)
We have the Real Academia Española (Royal Spanish Academy) which is the institution that publishes the official dictionary
In my region we have the Ofizina de Lengua Aragonesa, which tries to ensure that the aragonese language (the romanic language closest to disappear, very similar to catalan) doesn't disappear
You manage just fine but tbh your spelling and pronuntiation rules could use some experts and solid rulings hahaha
Hahahahaha, exactly
>On a more practical level, who would do the ruling
Who is an expert
The academics are self apointed
The RAE is not controled by any gobernment
there are 54 academics and when one resigns or dies some names are brought up (scientists, writters, proffesors, etc) and they just vote
And nobody does the ruling of anything
They are just notaries of the language
they observe how the language is being spoken and written and change the rules based on how people are actually speaking
Their motto is "Cleans it fixes it and gives it splendor", it being the language
they remove hte useless shit and they implement the new shit
There's one of these in every single spanish speaking country and every few years they all come together and make the new version of the dictionary
it's far more democratic than just a bunch of universities deciding they are the best at english and people going "yeah ok i guess".
This system allows for a lot of dynamism and also keeps the language coherent for every speaker of it
a lawyer from buenos aires uses the same vocabulary as one from Barcelona
And at the same time, dialects are obviously respected
"Limpia, fija y da esplendor"
I think Covid19 is a disease, not a virus
Not French related but once a tourist told me very surprised that they didn’t know that Spanish was spoken in Europe
I know
Dos cerveceras por favor lets go Benidorm
What parts of Flanders have French speakers
Same in Spain, English speaking countries and culture are referred to as anglo-saxons for some reason
But wouldn't they be part of the Brussels-Capital region rather than Flanders
I'm very traditional when it comes to listening to music
I would usually put flamenco when I'm reading and sometimes I like to put "pasodoble" (the music they play during the corridas, interesting to hear)
I'm from Aragon and our traditional music is called "la Jota", I honestly don't like it but well
Spanish rock and punk scene was roaring throughout the 80s and 90s, and some are still around with some other newer ones
If you're into that kind of music take a look at some bands like Kortatu, Cicatriz, Eskorbuto, Barricada, Reincidentes, Commando 9mm, Vómito, RIP, Soziedad Alkoholika, Baron Rojo, Rosendo, MCD, La Polla Records, Ska-P, Arpaviejas, Segismundo Toxicómano, Animales Muertos, Non Servium, and many others are great
Rap is not my genre of choice most of the time but something like Violadores del Verso, it's pretty good imo
Of all traditional music to be found in Spain, Galician/Asturian is awesome, many styles are similar to what you encounter in Brittany for example but with different scales
We've got amazing interpreters of Medieval/Renaissance music
Check out Jordi Savall or Capella de Ministrers
Superb
Manuel de Falla, Amor Brujo ️ I love this guitar arrangement by Paco de Lucía
Rap scene from the 90's

A predictable one, but Madrid vs Barcelona for football and politics
Its almost a batle royale but with zones aliance
but for my city Valladolid our rivals would be Leon
that castilian independentist from the comunity
I am not Irish myself, but I know there's a rivalry between Dublin and Cork
Of course everyone knows that Cork is the real capital of Ireland
In my expierence the capital of Gran Canaria Island, Las Palmas, and the capital of Tenerife Island, Santa Cruz
Both cities also have support by the second largest in the other ones island, La Laguna in Tenerife supports the Las Palmas football team while Telde in Gran Canaria has many fans of 'Tete', the Tenerife team
I know they might be bigger rivalries but this one is the one I have seen closer, there's also Vigo vs Coruña or Vigo vs Pontevedra and of course Barcelona and Madrid
Also Zaragoza and Huesca, but they aren't that famous so I think this is just a thing in Aragon
honestly i always love to read something abaut Italy and say
dude, you could be talking abaut my country
Reading the rest of the post, it is clear that in Europe the excessive centralisation in national capitals is generating a wave of hatred towards them from the rest of the country, and for similar reasons
Food for thought
In Toy Story 3, Buzz Lightyear starts speaking Spanish
In the Spanish dub he speaks Spanish with Andalusian accent, which is a nice detail
Yes, for example, Sebastian ( the crab/lobster from the little mermaid) that originally has Jamaican accent, for our version his accent is Cuban
Not really, Castilian Spanish dubs tend to destroy all the accents of all movies, there's some exceptions but as a norm characters don't have accents
Sometimes if the character is obviously foreign they keep the typical french or russian accent, but that's it
In Spanish dubs, characters often lose their accents
It's one of the many reasons I'm not a fan of dubs
The Little Mermaid was Disney's last movie to be premiered in Spain without a Spanish dub
They made a Spanish dub years later and they kept Sebastian's Cuban accent
Do Shrek and Donkey have different accents in English
In the Spanish dub all characters have standard accents except the Puss in Boots, who in English has a Spanish accent as he was dubbed by Antonio Banderas (who is Spanish, even if this version of the Puss in Boots was inspired by El Zorro, who's a Mexican character but was played by Banderas) and in Spanish has a thick Andalusian accent (Banderas is Andalusian)
Really
I didn't know that, I always watched all anime in Catalan, and with the Catalan dubbing Kero sounds normal
The Catalan regional TV had tons and tons of anime back then
I'm so used to the Catalan dubs of old anime that I also can't stand the Spanish ones in general
I'm not used to them
Edit: I just watched the castilian dub of Kero, WTF hahaha
I've watched videos from Latin experts and they say the classical Latin in the show is actually pretty good for most of the actors
Yeah the Spanish sub for anime does some weird shit sometimes
If I recall correctly in One Piece, [Usop had his name changed to Usuff and was suposed to be Arabic]
We do
But I think it depends on your definition of dialect
I read someone on this post say that a dialect needs a different grammar and word spelling
If that's the case, then I wonder what grammar differences some of our dialects have
We have a lot of dialects in Spain alone but they're more regional than local with some exceptions like Andalusia
There isn't a single Andalusian accent and we can't even consider "Andalusian" a dialect itself but rather a group of them
In Central and Northern Spain the accent is basically the same (although people from other regions claim they can tell differences) but there are different expressions and names for the same things
In regions with their own languages, Spanish is very influenced by whatever dialect of the other language the person speak and by how much they're exposed to it (native speaker or learnt it at school)
I dunno, Spain differs between regions but there isn't much of a change from town to town, but britain does have a lot of variety with the local accents
In Spain there's a huge dialectal variety
I'm from Catalonia (where there are also many dialects) and I have problems when understanding people from Extremadura or Andalusia
In Spain it's practically that, especially in the towns and villages, everyone of them has at least one special word that none other use
In Spain the younger people use a lot of region-specific dialects of Spanish
Theres dialects of Spanish in andalucia, theres dialects in catalonya where they speak inadvertenly put catalan words when they speak spanish
same in galicia, where they dont have compound verbs so they never use them and also use some galician words in Spanish
Can Flemish people understand the Dutch from the Netherlands
I'd say Argentinian does have enough properties to be a dialect
Yes there are
Andalusia, Murcia, Extremadura or Canary Islands speak their own dialect
Golden rule:
If it has its own grammar -> it’s a language
If it doesn’t but it has differences -> it’s a dialect
Accents are part of what makes a regional dialect
There is no line separating the two
Grammatical, phonetical and ortographical traits are all part of dialectal variation
If that different accent is particular to you, it would be part of your idiolect
If it were a family thing, it would be part of the familect
If it is common among one group of people, not exclusively constrained geographically, it would be part of a sociolect
If your pronunciation is different than the standard dialect used in media, you are indeed speaking another dialect
Some dialects are closer together than others in the dialectal continuum, but that doesn't mean they are to be ignored or underclassified
Phonetic differences aren't any lesser than ortographic differences (they actually tend to arise much earlier and determine the latter)
It is very infrequent for a population to be segmented enough to develop a specific accent without also developing some other linguistic particularities, such as lexical differences or new grammar constructions
So I think your distinction is pretty moot
You are using a definition of dialect that is very withdrawn from what linguists actually define as dialects; there is no golden rule that says it isn't a dialect until the spelling is different or the grammar changes
Phonetic and lexical deviations are actually much more common than a change in formal grammar, and especially ortography, since these are often crystallized by institutional enforcement
No linguist would tell you to not pay attention to phonetic changes until they make their way to the written form
One of the first things you learn in linguistics is that the difference between accent/dialect/language is primarily political rather than linguistic
Depending on the grade of acceptance, the common understanding of the word accent/dialect, and the linguistical image that the ones in power want to present, variants are moved from one group to the other
There you have China calling their different languages dialects, unintelligible to a speaker of a different one, while in Spain Andalusian is considered a dialect even though the difference are mainly in phonetics and it is mostly intelligible by other speakers
This is one of those cases where the words has so vastly different meanings depending on where you were born, that trying to pinpoint exactly one definition for each of them is a waste of time
Mutual intelligibility is a feature people try to use to distinguish between [languages and dialects] (this video also has a segment on "accents vs dialects" so I recommend you check it out)
You are saying if there is enough mutual intelligibility they aren't dialects at all
The truth is, an accent is just an imprecise and biased way of talking about the most noticeable nonstandard features of dialects while ignoring their linguistic complexity
As I said before, it's unlikely that an accent will develop without some other particularities
African-American Vernacular English has entirely original grammar and spelling features, but people still call it "blaccent".
Not saying you are biased, of course
You didn't invent the word "accent". We're used to looking at the wealthy dialect and setting it as the standard, and looking at everything else as an oddity and sort of lesser
Linguists try to approach language objectively and just observe, that's why they don't try to distinguish between "true" dialects and "just accents". They analyse the differences, big or small, and describe them
The name they happen to give to these differences is dialectal variation
There are some things, like etymology, reconstruction and written records, that can tell us when languages were born, and what they were born out of
These can tell us Catalan sprouted independently out of Latin, so it's definitely its own language
Many other factors determine language status, mostly, politics
While what I just stated is incontrovertible fact, for decades Catalan, Galician, Euskera and others were outlawed and considered by virtually everyone to be illegitimate dialects, if not outright inventions
Asturleonese is a language from the north of Spain that has been suppressed and ignored to virtual extinction, and many people believe it to just be a dialect to this day, which thanks to factors mentioned above we know is not true
Moldavia insists on calling their language Moldavian instead of Romanian, Valencia calls their dialect of Catalan Valencian and considers it a different language
Czechia and Slovakia too, etc
There is a common saying that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy, i.e. institutional power often leaves actual languages unrecognized and recognizes things that are not really their own languages as such, for non-scientific reasons
There is no fine line between an accent and a dialect, and neither is there between a dialect and a language
[Check this out]
Yeah, that's totally legit
As I said, linguistics seeks to observe language, rather than to determine right and wrong ways to use it, so I'm not about to go and say there is only one true meaning to "dialect".
In this case, we're talking about a specialised meaning and a colloquial one
But they aren't neat categories, for example, I wonder if you would consider the Netherlands to have as many dialects as OP does in their assessment, given that grammar and spelling variations are not necessarily the most commmon in these regional varieties
I think OP was using "dialect" in a broader way that aligns closer with the scientific criteria than with your colloquial usage, but it was still in an informal, non-specialized context
In other words, the lines between "accents" "dialects" and "languages" are very fuzzy even in informal context
I try to pitch the scientific/linguistic criteria whenever possible because I think it's a healthier way of thinking about language
For example, in Spain people from wealthy central areas like Madrid and Castille claim to have "no accent" while Andalusians are stereotyped to have a single, very thick accent seen as "hickspeak" so to say (a feeling that is documented all the way back to the 1500s)
Andalusian Spanish is actually [very complex] each region has distinct phonetics with their own cultural connotations (morphological and grammatical ones as well)
Accents *do* tend to evolve beyond superficial phonetics, that's why I think making regional variants out to be just accents might make us complicit in the erasure and stigmatization of nonstandard speech, which is class politics rather than language
The "Spanish Flu" probably originated in France
Since Spain was not censoring their press, unlike France, United States, Germany or UK, there was plenty of news about the influenza
The other countries started calling Spanish Flu and hiding the effects on their own population
You know, to keep morale high while you are dying from dehydration and malnourishment
Spaniards are blamed for wars in America while in real life the american tribes hated each other and wanted to kill each other way before the spaniards arrived
Spaniards only helped one side or another
*Latin America*: it should rather be called  "Hispanic America", but because our beloved Frenchies, with the help of their jelous partners in crime, Anglos and Dutchies, that term became popular and the latter got replaced
The goal of this was to overshadow and belittle Spain's leading role in the colonization and development of the Americas
*Spain-owned overseas territories were like British colonies*: no, the various territories located in the Americas, Africa and East Asia were all fully integral parts of Spain at the time, much like Castile or Aragon were, and weren't aimed at land exploitation or trade solely, unlike Great Britain or the Netherlands did with theirs
*Spain's slavery policy*: Spain rarely, if ever, involved in African slave smuggling unlike the English, the Dutch and the Portuguese
The Spanish abuses on America
Spain was the first one into create laws for native Americans protection, native slavery was banned, just black slaves were allowed, they had the same rights as a Spanish from Spain
Colombus went to jail for his brutal abuses
Spaniards created hospitals and collages in America for natives and mestizos
Yes, they used to don't care a lot about it, yes it wasn't exactly the same to live in Spain than in America but at least we weren't Brits French or Belgians and did genocidio
Please, Cortes conquered the Incan empire with just 300man
Also the inquisicion killed less people in Spain than the inquisiton on Germany France or England that also existed
Also the Americans blame us for kill all the Indians for California,  pretty ironic
Also, the Inquisition, another French invention
Damn it, France
What have we done to you
I don't think Spaniards think in Belgium when they mention Brussels and the EU
I think there are even Spaniards that don't know in which country is Brussels
The so known Black Legend, my friend
The jealous betraying merciless pirates (English and Dutchies mainly) have always been trying to belittle Spain in every aspect; its work in the Americas, its leading role there and in fields like the arts, alchemy, seafaring, astronomy, etc
at the time which were all crucial for human progress and without which modern science wouldn't be the same, etc
Also, as much as these pricks deny it, the Catholic Church did play a vital role in the colonization of the Americas as well as in its societal development (literacy of native population, creation for the first time of a proper grammar for Native-American languages and codification of those into the Latin alphabet
So yeah, definitely Spain isn't as bad as Hollywood and their Globalist Anglo friends make it to be
Brussels has become a synonim for EU
But we don't blame you
I believe England was way more "persuasive"... You can't even compare the extermination of north american natives and latin american native
And the only proof needed is the color of the skin, the facial features of the average north american (pure european until 50 years ago when they started to recieve inmigration from latam) and the average latinamerican, mixed and with a lot of american natives
Yeah I know, but a lot of people blames spaniards too and also the films does about the Spaniards and never about English French, etc
Yeah, Spanish empire is viewed as a brutal and dumb bunch of people, yeah I know what the Black legend is, but we can't fall in the white legend, that also exists
Well I doubt there are other countries out there with 'Galician language and literature' as a compulsory subject in some high schools
Alternative to religion (Alternativa a la religión)
I have friends from other countries in Europe that did have a Religion subject and, for those who don't want to take it, there are others to choose and some of them are interesting
In Spain we had this subject where we did literally nothing: no books, no exams, no homework, no content
Just spend an hour doing whatever you want while the teacher reads the newspaper
We do it in Spain
In the humanities path you have "history of art" as an optative subject, my brother did it
And in the tecnological path you do technical drawing too
We have them both, but arranged differently, in fact, just yesterday I had a dibujo técnico exam
In Spain Latin and Greek are taught in the bachillerato de humanidades (one of the 5 paths you can choose for 16-18 years)
In Spain we have Latin in Humanities (High school) and you can choose greek too
I did Latin and honestly it's very useful when learning other romance languages
What kind of projects and experiences
Sounds very cool, wish we had had such a subject
Instead, our final year trip (4 days to Paris) got cancelled becase most teachers didn’t want to go without being paid for the whole hours and not only 8 xdddd
I have some better subjects:
* 7th grade: "Interdisciplinary Proyect". It was such a filler, we mostly read studying guides and/or did other subjects homeworks
* 8th grade: "Education for the citizens"(? "Educación para la ciudadanía")
About human rights, feminism, ecology, laws, etc
* 11th grade: "Science for the Contemporary World". A little bit of general science
Iirc we had a lot of food related classes, to eat better, try to be healthier and "greener" in general
This was like 10 years ago
If you change it to catalan or Basque literature it's the same
But it's an optative subject in the humanities path in Catalonia . I took it
God this is so accurate
I was in alternative to religion as well and we didn't even have a teacher, we were free to do anything
Oh, when I was in high school it was mandatory for humanities (and easily the most time-consuming subject) and optional for arts
Same in Spain
My mother had mandatory sewing classes
At Science for the Contemporary World, we mostly did  Physics about the Universe
the teacher was our Physics teacher and very freak about the Universe so
I guess every teacher chose what to do in that shitty subject
I had almost forgotten it
Is it optative in high school
I thought these kind of subjects were always obligatory in their own regions
Maybe in the prior education system
My brother did  the old bachiller but I was one of the first doing the LOMCE
Spain is famous for changing the education system every few years :/
Yes
I'm pretty sure there aren't on the program anymore and maybe it was an Autonomy thing
I had a Bio teacher
I got lucky because my class was 95% humanities and socials plus me and my two buddies that did technology so the teacher was chill because most of the classroom hadn't had any science in some time
Yes, it is
You have catalan as a language subject just like Spanish or English but the catalan literature is an optative subject
Maybe
It might also depend on the autonomous community
I did it in Castilla La-Mancha but it might be different in Madrid or Andalucia
For us it was this subject for which you don’t really study and get a 10 (of course, if you are to some point interested in Science and have at least some brain cells xD)
It was multiple choice and very essy
Ooh that's sad :( we have language and literature inside the same subject
Well, I studied in Catalonia but I think subjects aren't changed
Are you older than 38
That's around when they changed the older education plan
This was more recent
Iirc 7th grade was 2011
Why
I don't think that's sad actually you can focus more on the subject, it's more specific, if you're keen on it because that's all you'll do the whole year
nah I'm 28
I did the last year the LOE (I think it was the last year at least) was active
Idk I think you can understand better a language through its literature as well
And it's never a bad thing to learn the culture around you
Then it's the education plan after mine
Yes but If you do 2 subjects in one you won't go as deep on both subjects as you would if you devide them
Edit: Spain
The closest thing we have to that is Irun/Hendaia (Basque Country)
Also Vilar formoso (Portugal) and Línea de la Concepción/Gibraltar (UK) might be some examples
But nothing quite like some Benelux cities
Le Perthus is a little Catalan mountain town divided between France and Spain after the Spanish kings ceded the parts of Catalonia north of the Pyrenees in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659
The main street serves as the "physical" border
Dantxarinea (Spain) and Dancharia (France) is a small village in the Navarrese border so I guess that it was divided as a result of the division of the former kingdom of Navarre between France and Spain in the 16th century
There are no more divided towns that I know of
Borders between Portugal and, subsequently, the kingdom of León, the Crown of Castile and Spain have barely changed and if they have (like Olivenza/Olivença) they were redone taking towns into account
The same thing goes for the majority of towns in the border with France
What is very common is "sister" towns appearing is strategic parts of the borders like La Línea next to Gibraltar, or towns separated by a river that became a border like Hendaya and Irun or Tuy and Valença.
Not that many
at least that I know of
Being a peninsula we don't really share that much border like in mainland Europe, so there's only two borderes where "border towns" could happen: France and Portugal
Geography makes it harder for the first case, but after a quick look at the map there seem to be a couple of very small merged villages in the Pyrenees
Irún/Hendaya in the Basque Country could be considered the same town, only separated by a small river
In the case of Portugal geography wouldn't be a problem, however, there really isn't that many border towns
I only found a few small villages on the map
There's also the border with Morocco with our cities Ceuta and Melilla but they're not border towns with any Moroccan counterpart
Yeah theres a few in the Spain-France border
I've been in the basque one
Jeeze
imagine living in that town before the EU/Schengen Area
I assume they had some sort of special immigration considerations
In a trip before the corona I crossed from Slovenia to Italy through Gorizia in bus and there was a super long police check
We were stopped for like 45 minutes, which sucked
Is that normal
What's the deal
I didn't expect such a control whithin the EU
Yeah I didn't notice crossing the border
The stop was a regular city stop to pick/drop people up/off at the bus station/stop, but there was a Carabinieri car which ran that long, annoying passport/ID check
Actually I luckily cut it close but the panic didn't start yet
It was only a few days after that, just when I got back home, that the panic started when the outbreak was reported in Northern Italy
Btw how are you guys holding out in Slovenia
I was in Ljubljana and Bled
Total lockdown
Yeah what's the deal with the red water
Is it boat oil
Algae
He is respected as one of the strongest and most influential figures in the history of Europe
At the same time, he betrayed us and invaded us (along with many other places), and he turned his own country into a despotic regime again
So he's seen as an ambitious and ruthless ruler, as are many other historic strongmen
In Spain he’s seen as a person who was a great military leader and he organized a good state in France, however, he’s also seen as a despotic madman who conquered, pillaged, raped, and anihilated his way through Europe, especially Spain, where he’s remembered as the person who the brave civilians fought back against for our independence and made us create modern guerrilla warfare to fight his troops and the Mamelukes
Thanks to him, or thanks to the hatred we had to him we developed our first liberal constitution and we were first really united us as a nation
Nothing about The slavery
I read sometimes Ago that after you got the independence from Spain and the USA was the new "owner" your president came to the funeral of the spanish King and told that he regreted to support the independence because the americans betrayed you and Spain didnt
I don't know a lot
You were a colony and then you got independence in the late 1800's. I reckon we killed a lot of people in your country
I do know that the British came afterwards, and purged Spanish speakers, but only because I was curious about the relatively low numbers of Spanish speakers given the colonial past, and did some research
Can confirm
I know we were at war with "Flandes" and it was our territory before but I had no idea it was so important for y'all
Nah, the eastern front is where it really was at, the western front was a gentlemen Battle, you won that shit not the english or the USA
Yeah, in Spain he's a complex figure
On one hand he betrayed us and ruthlesly conquered us
But on the other, he exiled arguably the worst king in our history, and the independence war against France gave us our first constitution and reinforced the sense of national identity (at least in Madrid, where Independence war stuff is everywhere)
Spain accepted it and it didnt go well for them neither napoleon
The average Spaniard's knowledge about the Philippines is "oh yeah ,we had that too".
Yeah, and it started a civil war in Spain , so so
I've always felt a sort of pity for him because of the end of his life story
Exiled to an island, manages to return, garner troop support out of sheer popularity and seize power for 100 days, and then exiled to an island much further away until he died
Such a humiliating end for a once mighty emperor
I have a strong sense of admiration for him
Sometimes I think what Spain would be like had we not won against France
Sure, no independence, but no Fernando VII or Isabel II either, possibly not Carlist wars
who knows, it's fun to imagine
It would be interesting if you try some of the romance languages like French or Spanish, since English is a german language but with a lot of romance vocabulary
French: [French]
Spanish: [Spanish]
Yes
Any sweatpants, and old, baggy clothes from before I lost a weight
Same
We don't have a song, but we have a saying, that It says: "Todo buen Español debe mear mirando hacia Inglaterra", which translates to: "Every good Spaniard has to piss watching to England". It's a very old saying that originated when we were always fighting eachother
Sorry but what is that because most people don't understand
I mean, your anthem is literally a military marching song about fighting invaders
OMG I've been waiting for this all my life
HOI4: I like to play as a Spain for quite obvious reasons, win the civil war and then join maybe the allies, the axis or the commies, and try to hold against the others until american reinforcements arrive, try it as a challenge, it's fun (if I'm inspired I also go for the Mercadona anarchism world conquest thanks to the best mod ever created)
Also, as a tip (please dont get mad boys
NO NOT OLIVENÇA AGAIN PLS) the first thing I do as soon as I finish the civil war is annex Portugal
Spain early sucks and those factories, territory and overseas are basically free and really useful
I also like playing with France, the Uk, Italy, Greece and for some weird reason almost all Balkan countries
As for other games, I also like CK2-3
Again, my main is Spain, but this time is not for obvious reasons, but because they have one of the funniest games
Just try Urraca and fuck and assassinate your way to all three kingdoms, and then try to win the reconquista
The HRM and biz is cool to play with
I haven't done a lot of runs yet in CK (II and III) and EUIV, but I went for Spain in my first games and it's really fun
In Crusader Kings I usually go for the Kingdom of Galicia in 1066 because that's where I'm from and it's a fun game to struggle against your brothers of Castille and Leon while trying to get as much territory as possible in the Reconquista ASAP so you can overpower them or plot against them so you can inherit or even conquer their Kingdoms
I've also played a couple games with vikings and I obviously started my first games in Ireland (AKA Tutorial Island)
In EUIV Spain is also very fun, rushing colonization is basically like painting the map and it gives you a ton of money, once you have all of America (North and South and the Caribbean), Australia and half the Pacific and Africa you're just too OP for other to deals with you, I just ended up eating Italy, France and even started advancing east towards the Balkans against Poland-Lithuania, which got extremely big in my game
I was planning on backstabbing Austria (my allies) and probably conquering China, but I changed my PC and didn't backup the games so :'(. I've also played as Portugal (painting the map as well) and played for a couple hundred years or so as England, but I never really got that hooked in that one
In Hearts of Iron I do have more experience though
I first went to play the big countries, Germany and USSR (hope the latter gets a rework soon) and basically learnt how to play with them
Then I played with some smaller countries and realised I have no idea how to actually play lol
I'd say the Spanish Civil War is a great tutorial and it's extremely fun
I played with Spain a lot of times and loved what they did in La Resistance with it, I sometimes even started a game with no intention of playing past 1938-39 just for the civil war
It's painfully slow now, but it used to be a great way to learn how to move your army in a more flexible frontline (there were literally not enough troops to cover it before the rework) and make advances and encirclements
Nowdays it's just another war but in a smaller scale, and the focuses are pretty awesome, especially if you know the actual history behind it
So far I've played with Germany, the USSR, Spain, France, Italy, USA, Japan, Portugal and UK
It's a game I really love and strongly recommend to anyone who actually has the time to dive into it and slowly get a hold of the extremely complex mechanics of land warfare
In naval all you have to know unless you're playing with UK or the USA is submarines go BRRRRRR
I have mostly played Crusader Kings, although quite extensively
Still suck at it so I usually play "easier" early game countries
- Irish Earldoms - Easy peasy and is always cool to unite the whole of Ireland
- Kingdom of Navarra or Asturias (Spain) - I'm from Navarra so is quite fun to play around places you know
Plus Reconquista
- Lombardy or Tuscany (Italy) - I think they have a quite interesting early game
You can try to unite Italy and reform the Roman Empire
- Norse Jarldoms - Easy to grab large pieces of land from other nordic territories
Love to play as Sweden in more modern history strategy games like Total War Empire, so creating the kingdom tends to be my first target
CKII: I tend to go with smaller countries or duchies and escalate from that position
The most memorable games I've play were Navarre, Brittany, Scotland and Croatia
In this last one I failed to take control over Hungary, but it was fun
I play the one with the skill/habilities/whatever that fits my gameplay style or tastes
On Civ V I always pick Catherine the Great
I always try to keep Portugal as a friend and ally for obvious reasons, as Spain
It's true at some point during the colonization period you have to take over otherwise they become a too strong competitor
But I feel bad about wiping Portugal off the face of the Earth so I try to get a personal union or, although less happy about it, forced vassalization
I've never played Portugal but I'd love to, and I'd totally murder Spain and have a Portuguese Iberia instead
To avoid a civil war in hoi4 Portugal try to have good stability
It’s one of the best countries to play imo
Hey man I like you
I also try to do that with Spain (hoi)
You gotta try it, its a nice fun challenge
Funny, I like to play as France and try to hold the germans haha
What I usually do is war early on to get rid of the alliance with England and maybe get some of the provinces and then let them colonize for a couple centuries before conquering them
It's free real state
The Pyrenees make it kinda manageable
You either go all in with the Allies' support and try to rush through France (and probably lose hundreds of thousands) or accept the standstill in the mountains and focus on getting Africa back from Vichy
I always enjoy a good war against the Allies and getting Gibraltar back though lol
If you're bored you can always go for the reconquest back america because memes
Just be fascist or commie, bring some ships and take brazil, the rest of countries are free to take\*
\*As long as US is not guaranteeing them
Ummm
Spain's got older kingdoms inside of it but as a whole Portugal is older so
I like to think of it as three young brothers, Castille, Portugal and Aragon
Then Castille ate Aragon and then ate Potugal, but then barfed Portugal because it made it's tummy feel sick
I'm starting to think this is not the best metaphor
Gargantilla del Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago, with 44 letters
Spain: Gargantilla del Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago (44 chars)
How do you guys pronounce the parts with the "wszczcyzn"?
Villarcayo de Merindad de Castilla la Vieja, with 43 comes close
But that's a municipality, aren't gargantilla de lozoya and Pinilla de Buitrago two towns
I've found Colinas del Campo de Martín Moro Toledano with 35 letters
Don't know whats the criteria but i'll leave It here just in case
Much more epic name to be fair
No, it's the name of a town
[here]
Wow, got it
Thanks for explaining it
It does have a nice ring to it
and here IS the sign from when you leave one of the towns
A municipality can include several towns
It is  officially the town with the longest name
It was 2 towns but they got united as one with one council
It's something quite common and sometimes they keep the original names
In my in laws town they did it even if they changed the name 40 years ago
Entre 1920 y 2001 el municipio se llamó Gargantilla de Lozoya, hasta que cambió su nombre por Gargantilla de Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago
By the way municipality is usually used as synonymous of town/city
It can have more than one but that's not the case
Ok, my bad
Then the sign must be outdated
If you mean a city abroad, I'm supposed to go to Ghent, Belgium, to do my Erasmus this September
I still don't know if I'm going to as I delayed the decision after the exams
It'll be harder to look for accomodation by then, but I hope I have more information
If I don't, I don't really want to risk going just to be stuck at my apartment with online lessons so I'll probably reduce the Erasmus to the last semester and probably try to apply for the next year's first semester in the same place
Or maybe leave the entire erasmus for the next year
I don't know
In Europe I want to visit Rejkjavik, out of Europe I want to visit Hong Kong
I'd been wanting to take the train from Madrid to Bordeaux, staying at a couple stops along the way
I love trains and I love wine so it's like an ideal vacation for me
Never heard of it
What's the flex program
Geneva
Sport cars everywhere
Bankers and ads about watches and luxury items
Everyone wearing expensive suits
Monaco
Full of expensive car shops and expensive cars
I saw several Rolls-Royce cars and Bentleys and so on during like a 5 minute stroll
But Nice was also really posh
I live in Marbella, Spain
Luxury tourism is huge here, specially from Central/Northern Europe, Russia and the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa), so I am used to see weird license plates in rather expensive cars
The rarest I've encountered is a Dubai license plate, which really colourful and beautiful was very different from other ones I've seen from the MENA region, such as Morocco and Saudi Arabia, which are the most common
Link: [
A New Zealand plate in Zaragoza
I almost ran a red light staring at it
Arroba in Spanish
It's an old measurement equivalent to 11,502 kg
(Edit: 25,3575694 lbs)
It's an *arroba*. The symbol itself has been traditionally used in commerce to represent the unit of mass of the same name
@ = Arroba
Which is a way of saying amphora (ánfora) and was formerly a measure of weight represented by the same symbol
#TIL that it is called "at" in many languages lol
Why had I never thought about how @ would be called in other languages
La letra que roba
AFAIK arroba is the only name for the symbol
Yep, usually in this order:
* Portugal
* France
* Italy
* Any other EU country
* Whoever is playing against England
Spanish here
Usually underdogs like Croatia, Wales, Iceland, etc
I can't avoid to cheer for the underdogs
I like to cheer for Portugal, Italy or Netherlands if there is not a better option
I cheer the team that plays against France, England or Germany too
In southern Europe, we cheer **against** our neighbour countries
The farther a country is, the more we encourage it
If we're eliminated I root for the Portuguese team in the Euro Cup and Argentina in the World Cup
I feel patriotic for more than one country even
Tho I'm spannish/brittish i'll cheer for the croats and the poles or basicaly any underdog
I tend to cheer for Germany after Spain
I don't really know why
Simply, I don't cheer for any other country, I simply don't care if they win or lose
Ooh, but we do cheer for Portugal
We like you
It’s just protocol, nothing else
You can dislike us, but that doesn’t mean we won’t love you :)
Why are you so mean
How amazingly rowdy the London nightlife is
Every night
No matter where we went
We saw fights
Also, cocaine
It seemed as common as alcohol at times, even at like bbqs hahaha
When I visited in Britain, i was surprised at how little people cared for cuisine
Even parents cared very little for cooking, and young families would barely know how to cook anything
THe standards for food were extremelly low compared to the ones in Spain
Also it was surprising to me how there wasnt a  mid-day break for lunch but I now realize its Spain thats special in that regard
I went one year to Ireland (studied abroad)
boys only schools, how Green everything is all year round, how long the Sky can be covered in clouds, how much the irish LOVE their native Sports, how few gaeilge irish people can actually speak, how the police IS (virtually) unarmed, how there are no birds bigger than a seagull whatsoever, how many small birds there are, how repetitive irish food really IS, those 1 kg crisp bags, how flat everything was, gravy dust, bogs, how nice is Dublin, how crazy IS Dublin in St Patricks, how sporty irish students are, how few gingers there are (yeah, you're stereotype is Ginger)
Those from the top of my head, i was very Young and It was a long time ago,
In Ireland for 3 years, they seem to love cold wet wind
crazy people
I miss them (the people, not the wind, I hated the wind)
what time did they start to work
because here he start 8-9 and at 10:30 we usually go breakfast and this would be very shocking for me too, plus my stomach is partially closed to eat some type of food at 10:30am
That sounds a lot like Madrid, somehow I didn't expect It from Germany
>I don't think I've used cash in Finland for a good 8 years now
I think we're a bit behind
I use cash constantly, last time a few hours ago
Domestic violence is not particularly worse than in other countries, it is just that it has become a very important issue in Spanish society
We are trying to take it seriously
The slap thing is true
I live in the USA which is similar to the UK in terms of international cuisine
The thing is that countries like Spain or Italy have a "system" of cooking and eating that allows for nutritious food at an affordable price
My wife also complains about how most Spanish recipes follow the same basis and the lack of variety in supermarkets
I've lived in Cork for 3 years and I miss their restaurants
They weren't cheap but they were good as fck
People said Cork restaurants have a lot of French influence while using local products, that's what makes them so good
Their politeness ends when they enter a pub haha
See that's the thing
I assume coke is common here in spain (we rsnk high) but never in like a bbq or with friends
I remember once going to a bar in Lisboa with my aunt one summer we travelled together, she asked for a coffee with ice and the bartender automatically said "Ah, Spanish
". I was just a kid and thought it was a bit magic that he knew that fast
In hindsight, it could have also been the accent
Do you eat something else before going to bed or is dinner your last meal
Because if a normal person goes to bed at 11pm that is 5 hours without having eaten anything, I can't sleep with my stomach empty
>I find eating before 8 super strange too
Yeah, eating at 7:30
Sounds alien
We need a fisrt hand account about Spain, i think It Will Sit comfortably between the two
>My wife also complains about how most Spanish recipes follow the same basis and the lack of variety in supermarkets
How so
Genuinely curious
I really don't know much about day to day cooking in the US, so it's a bit hard to compare
What do they eat
What does spanish day to day food look like to them
and you don't have breakfast with your coworkers
Yeah, if they're loud and eating late, they're either portuguese, spanish or italian
Portuguese- sound russian
Italian- move a lot their hands
You can also spot an italian from their clothes and a German for their backpack
Never thought of It that way, but it's true
in Spain supermarkets are thought to make spanish food
There's a lot of variation to the method but the ideas repeat, it's definetely not as varied as having japanese and Indian cooking on your sleave
However i have to ask, do english people actually cook so much variety
Or do you only find It on restaurants
Because when i was in Ireland the diversity plumitted to almost 0, and my impression has always been that english people don't care much for cooking
In Spain going out to eat at a restaurant IS way less common, even takeout food doesn't seem as prevalent as in other places
If you could go a bit deeper on what patterns you see repeating in spanish cooking i would LOVE It
Para ella hay muy pocas cosas y faltan productos que son normales en los supermercados de EEUU porque hay tantos inmigrantes de todos los países del mundo
La mayoría de las recetas españolas si lo piensas están basadas en el sofrito o en pucheros de algún tipo y a veces es un poco repetitivo
En mi opinión las ventajas de la cocina española es que necesita frigos menos llenos de cosas, salsas que usas muy poco y botes de conservas
Eso y la gestión de la alacena
Digamos que mi mujer y yo, pero sobre todo ella, hace la compra en función de las recetas que vamos a cocinar y a veces por cualquier razón no cocinamos y entonces hay cosas que se echan a perder
Sin embargo, tengo la impresión que en la cocina española, salvo que vayas a hacer algo especial la compra es siempre muy similar: verduras, fruta, pollo, queso, yogur, pescado
Creo que la falta de este sistema que menciono es una pequeña parte de los factores que contribuyen a la obesidad
I met a guy who worked at a restaurant called Orso and told me that, there is like a chain of restaurants there that have all this French inspired cuisine
I remember a lot of French people living in Cork so it didn't suprised me
At what time do you dinner
You must be starving by 6pm
Tiene sentido, es verdad que la estructura del sofrito y el puchero se repite mucho
Aunque lo cierto es que parece más bien que es un problema de los sitios con gastronomía bien arragaida, es decir en china, según la región también encontrarás sabores muy similares y técnicas muy parecidas, en Japón igual, así como en Perú o en México
Al final una gastronomía tiene que tener algo que la defina
Las recetas se han ido desarrollando alrededor de un núcleo de ingredientes y técnicas y por tanto al cabo de un tiempo se puede hacer repetitiva
Pero lo cierto es que dentro de las gastronomías mundiales nunca me ha parecido que la española fuera especialmente repetitiva
I mean, no one can beat Romania at being the latín black sheep
In short: TAX HAVENS
I know that some have left the official list of havens in recent years, but different countries are constantly entering and leaving that list depending on whether or not they get agreements that allow them to pretend that they are not
For me, the worst thing is that they feed certain nationalisms that aspire to become tax havens and get rich at the expense of the impoverishment of other countries
I love them, I think decentralization is way better than full centralization, and redundancy, contrary to what some people might think, is positive
I wish there were more small states and kingdoms all over europe
I'm Catalan so I love Andorra and they're like cousins to us
I go there every year usually and honestly with all the current politics in Catalonia I think many people look up to them as an example of a future independence
I've been to Vatican City and I really enjoyed my visit, its a curious and interesting little "city".
Regretfully I don't know much about the other microstates
Sometimes I wonder how they can get their wealth from, most of them are tax havens though so it's a plus
I dont get Luxembourg
My in-laws live in France but work in Geneva, so they are pretty close to the border
They have two phones each one, a French one and a Swiss one
Visiting them mean to turn off my data plan and only turning it on when I want to look up something but checking the current network company first
This situation made me realize how man-made and arbitrary borders are
In Andorra the presidency is shared between the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell (Catalonia /so far Spain)
It's a 50%.
US trying to force a war to the limit
Always good to be reelected as President
&#x200B;
If Iran would've killed a US general, tomorrow there would be fire on Teheran
The guy was a terrorist and didn't deserve better
But assassinating him is a dumb idea (and an act of war from the US
) that will only escalate things in the middle East
Iran doesn't want war with the US, they know they won't gain anything from it
But they can retaliate against Saudi Arabia, Israel, or even closing the Ormuz strait
In summary, the US caused it but the ones paying the price will probably be their allies
That Trump's reelection prospects must be really dire if he has to
resort to outright war with Iran to garner support
I just hope Macron, Merkel and other European leaders make a firm stand against this
Even if Suleimani had indeed been leading the embassy attacks and planning to go after other US assets this hardly justifies such a reckless and inflamatory action
EDIT: after looking up a bit about the man it seems he did indeed deserve to be killed, but again, this was a reckless move that only poured gasoline to the region
Let's be real, this will be just another Gulf War
I hope
It's an error
Europe wants none if this wouldn't be surprised if we bought their oil
Usa is a kid with guns
Dangerous and erratic
On one hand you have the option of killing a man responsible for thousands of deaths in Iraq and Syria
On the other hand you have the option of killing that man and risk inflamating the region and causing more thousands of deaths
There's really no good option here, but I'd say it would have been better not to kill Suleimani, even if he deserved it
As much as he deserved to be killed, I just don't see any good outcome coming out of this (for the people in the Middle East; we know Trump will surely capitalize on it for the coming elections)
Maybe, but blowing up one of the top dogs in the Middle East with an air strike doesn't sound like a smart move if what you want is that Iran stops attacking your assets and extending their influence, let alone stabilizing the place
I doubt anybody wants war, neither Washington nor Teheran
Maybe Iran retaliates attacking objectives in Saudi Arabia or intervening further in Iraq, with the maximum being closing the Hormuz Strait
high oil prices winners:
USA, Russia, Arabia
&#x200B;
Losers:
China, Europe
I think OP meant Iran doesn't operate *against* Europe
I mean, if we were honest many state organizations could be considered as terrorist organizations
Almost every intelligence organization would belong on that list
"BUT I WANT BIG BOOM-BOOM
" Trump, probably
Arabia would win in the long term, plus the destruction of his long time shia foe
(Actually, Arabia has been dumping oil prices for some time now and is doing fine)
Russia would win with the rising prices anyway as Europe would have no alternative market
Morocco
They've already done it (even though last time it was just a rock in the middle of the sea), and there are still some unresolved border issues
Morocco
I'm in Barcelona, so, Spain
The amount of "Russia"s in this thread is astonishing
Spain
What no no we don’t....
Can we agree to trade lisbon for i dont know maybe Catalonia
Totally not
Anyway how are your air forces
Asking for a friend
Long as you respect our tapas we are fine bros
Russia being invaded by Russia sounds like a civil war to me
Still there, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but certainly not bad enough to warrant an invasion
Brexit has smoothed things up a bit for now
We would be the invaders in that case
ಠ_ಠ
We are watching you
We are experts on that
At least this time they aren't emus
And we have a counter counter attack its called pee the tagus river
There’s nothing you can do to stop it from flowing into your country
They are our main source of income during summer, so they have a higher price
Even we are trying and we didn't even joined the war
*1385 vietnam flashbacks intensifies*
Truce break and best cb should do it
Yes, we have “bares” (“bar” in singular) where you usually can have cheap food or “tapas”, really common here AFAIK, specially around university areas where they have really cheap beer
In Spain there are menu restaurants, with a fix price of 10-12€ and a full meal
They only serve menus and they are a mix of traditional, cheap food and basic food like macaroni or soup
I guess that's a typo, but I love the idea of a giant monster full of cheese and bechamel sauce
I didn't know that, but I love it
There's that old [Spanish song] about that woman who cheats on her boyfriend with two of his friends and wants to go to New York to cheat some more
You might not have heard it though
"Que tinguem sort". It's a song written in Catalan, not even in Spanish
But it's a beautiful song,  a really beautiful song with a beautiful meaning
[La canción del velero]
One of the advantages of having a global language with a worldwide music industry is that music in our language can be pretty famous everywhere
On the other side, sometimes things like Despacito happen and you can't even get away from it during your holidays abroad
Was looking for someone recommending Alligatoah, thank you sir
I was shown Du Bist Schön at my german course and since then I've been learning the lyrics
It's amazing
In Spanish he speaks completely normal, no accent and 100% correct spelling
Yes
I am a native Spanish speaker and I found it very weird as I read the books in German, since in Spanish Hagrid speaks completely normal
In middle school I was chosen for the school board as a student representative
I spent 4 years lobbying for lockers, but those are unheard of in Spain (also: budget)
Editorial companies really push their agenda and you get around 10 books a year, usually having to carry at least 5 a day + notebooks and other material
Note these books are very heavy, so I was carrying the order of 10-15+ kg with a height of 130 cm and a weight of 40-50 kg myself
Luckily the way was short, but I struggled with back problems for years until I finished compulsory education
To my knowledge, later students got their books split in smaller tomes, so they could carry only 1/3 of the pages to school, and to be fair for a couple years we got a very thoughtful teacher who established a system wherein we each got a little bit of shelf-space in the classroom cabinet, but yeah, I consider books and material carrying one of the many systemic problems in Spanish education
I've never went to a school with lockers
In my current highschool we have lockers, which appear to only be symbolic because nobody uses them
Why
Because they have no lock, no code, no padlock
Anyone can open it by twisting the thing
Every single corridor is lined with these dead lockers
I don't know either
My HS had acquired lockers when I was in \~2 year (12-13yo) since the alternative was carting around 10 Kg+ bags all over the place (yes, only the essential books for the day)
They were for rent, though, and my parents didn't believe in them, so
Obligatory "Kids these days have it so easy" xD
I'd've loved to have had books in fascicles, my bag would have been soooooooo much lighter
I didn't realise how that makes me look, hahaha
But really, it's great that kids these days have it easier
My backpack was inhumane
> I didn't realise how that makes me look, hahaha
It helps if I cherrypicked a single sentence from your two paragraphs hahahahahah
I just realised that a few years ago, when I did a week of the Camino, I carried ***less*** weight (8Kg) on my back than an average day of highschool (10-13 Kg)
FOR A WEEK ON THE ROAD
Absolutely ridiculous
Yes
I do frequent hiking/camping and my full backpack for 15 days with water and some food was only slightly heavier than the school one
Besides, those backpacks are much more comfortable and better suited for heavy weights
School backpacks are usually very uncomfortable on the shoulders for me
millions = millones
billions = miles de millones (thousands of millions)
trillions = billones
quadrillions = miles de billones
And so on
In Spanish it's as in German, millones, millardos, billones, billardos, trillones, trillardos, etc
But the -ardo ones are barely used so it's more common to use "mil millones" (a thousand millions) than "un millardo" (a millard)
10³=mil
10⁶=millón
10⁹=mil millones
10¹²=billón
10¹⁵=mil billones
10¹⁸=trillón
million = millón
billion = mil millones (“one thousand millions”)
trillion = billón
Same in Spanish
["Millardo"] exists for "miles de millones" like close words in other languages in this post
Also "billardo" for a thousand billions and "trillardo" for a thousand trillions (from the same article)
Absolutely nobody uses "millardo", though, unless maybe in some specific scientific context, although I have never heard it uttered
You only use "millardo" when explaining that word actually exists lol
I know the word exists, but I literally haven't heard or seen it used even once
You always see "mil millones".
I heard it on a gameplay though
Was it from a Spaniard
Yes, MayorceteGaming
On this gameplay:
I just realised it is the game itself that uses the word "millardo".
A friend of mine lives in the town of Alcalá de Henares (  )
This place is old
Talking various preroman sites old
And the thing is this friend lives in the city center and was making some work in the garage and they torn down a wall and suddenly they were in the catacombs, that used to be the late roman-early medieval streets
So fucking cool
I read all three Metro books and I thought Metro-2 was just an inside lore thing
Interesting
Didn't know about it
Is ithe book canon
I'll probably read it, then
Usually people would say: Weather, Gastronomy (paella, tapas and much more),  Wine, History and Culture, Parties (sangria), Flamenco (Olé),  Soccer and sports in general (Nadal, Alonso, Gasol, Marc Marquez, Carolina Marin
Also, the fact that more people speak Spanish than English
It's the second-most widely spoken language in the world (after Mandarin Chinese), with 400 million native speakers, and official status in a staggering 21 countries, spanning South, Central and North America, as well as Africa and Europe
Also, unfortunately Bullfights, but thankfully it's slowly disappearing
And I would like to add some unknown things:
We are the third country with the most World Heritage sites behind Italy and China
There is a bar for every 169 inhabitants, the highest average in the European Union
We are leaders in organ donation
We are top-3 most visited countries (with France and USA)
Spain is the first country in the world in terms of acceptance of homosexuality, only 6% of the population believes that it is "morally unacceptable
We are at the forefront of Europe in cocaine use
We invented the mop, the stapler, the lollipop, the submarine, the cable car, the foosball
We are one of the European countries with the lowest suicide rate
We win in bars per capita, this is a good one
Our constant Infighting
Oh and beaches too
High quality infrastructures
We have one of the largest high speed train systems in the world, with trains reaching the highest speeds in Europe
And Madrid has one of the largest metro systems as well
We are one of the world leaders on super-fast broadband availability
Motorways/freeways are mostly free and well cared
Importing of olive oil, the second most visited country, and the country that once conquered a huge part of the world (and there is still discussion about it)
And also confusing with Mexicans
Great public Healthcare, I guess
Oh, and also we are in top 3 olive oil producers/exporters
They guy who invented the mop patented it and became very rich
I love Basque, but a lot of languages have no known relatives around the world
For example Korean has more speakers and it is considered an isolated language too
And a lot of smaller languages, too
Tbh, me too
That's what Charles I of Spain said Like 300 years before the british Empire was a thing :)
The rave scene started in the UK though, and the concept of "superstar DJs" like Paul Oakenfold
I can name many current DJs and producers from UK like Third Party, Gareth Emery, Carl Cox or Above and Beyond
No, we don't.
No, it's rare but I usually do it
Here we say it to the bus driver when we enter
Not in Spain
You are not alowed to exit to the front so no way you can say anything to the driver
But we do say hello or goodmorning or whatever when we enter
I don't know about anywhere else, but for general public transport in Madrid you don't. Mostly because there's a second door in the middle, where you get off the bus, and then obviously, you're too far away
Same, although plenty of people say nothing even at the entrance
Well, not everybody, but some people does
Especially in smaller towns or when the bus is almost empty
I'm from a small town and no one says anything because you disembark through the rear door
Me, a Spaniard, watching some English, Welsh, and Irish people arguing about the correct and polite term to mention the two islands in the north of France
\[insert the stonks meme man with "cultur" in it\]
Usually I'd support them taking the anti-capitalist side, but in this case they're anything but that when it comes to their actual business
They take an absurd amount of money selling virtual items to people who get hooked on their games, especially Hearthstone
People spend thousands on that game
So fuck them for that
It will look veary bleak on blizzard's part when china eventualy changes, but we can only hope
I know it will have no real effects (Blizzard will definitely win more money thanks to their decision than they'll lose from any boycott from western players), but I'm not going to buy any Activision-Blizzard games if they don't change their stance
A shame as I wanted the new Call of Duty, but eh, I have a lot of games to play anyway
I understand, but in my case for example I was in doubt of joining wow classic and now I just dont
So for many people just made their decision easier
Fuck any totalitarian party*. There are democratic communist parties and the CCP isn't even communist
Why this is the first time I read this
Please make a post about this
I understand the sense but sorry, I honestly cringed
There are
It has never been applied, for sure, and it may never happen, but theoretically in democratic communism the establishment of the new system is progressive and through democratic means and the economy is controlled through democratic decisions as well, not by an unlected bureaucracy
Not saying I support that or that it's feasible, just that there are people who support those things and also multiparty democracy with full rights and guarantees
I'm not talking about Cold War EE communist regimes nor their nostalgics
It is to prevent hackers from deleting accounts, and has been implemented way before the China thing many years ago
But I do agree that I wouldnt trust neither Activision to have my face ID seeing how easy they fall for leak attacks
But surely we should differentiate between people who support that and people who support Stalinism or Maoism, shouldn't we
>Not saying that I support it or tht it's even feasible
Did you miss the part of supporting democracy with full rights and guarantees
Democratic communists and socialists aren't people just waiting to be voted to establish dictatorship
I thought we were talking about totalitarianism vs democracy, not about economic success
Portugal and Spain
Portugal looks like a face and Spain is its hair making the Iberian Peninsula a head
If we go farther France is a neck and Italy is a claw making Europe look like a human faced T-rex
Spain is a toilet
I always think of the Yucatan peninsula as the largest continental dick
I love that we form a face looking to the side
Well, if we add Portugal ;)
Every EU country positon is the same: "no, don't do it, that is not good
" but tbh on a more national level people and the government just don't fucking care about yet another war on that region
It's a fucking landgrab
One day the world will look on Yemen and Syria the way it looks on 1930s Spain and Czechoslovakia
Everyone is being a dick lately .
Just the same here,  I tried to think about it deeply
Yet the genocide of kurds should not be tolerated by Europe and something must be done, but what
I bet you are fun at parties, huh
I was just stating the complete lack of interest europe in general (and spain in particular) with the constant conflicts that part of the world has
It's sad but it's just a fact, very few peoole care
Because they won't be an agreement
Pissed enough so the givernments will agree to send troups or do actually useful about it
I just Doubt it, man
We can be angry for a week but we won't care for much longer and if we did we wouldn't hesitate on doing what's needed
I know when they aren't native speakers because I understand them
When someone is speaking a second language they speak slower and clearer
Easy rule
If somebody uses 3 vocals at the same time and uses lazy consonants
Boom, native
Example: æxcüese me sïer, äre you frœm England
Unless it is highly predominant the O, so there is a chance to be oirish
Example, hoy, moyt, hoy yo dooin'
Side note, if there is no T, probably English
Yes because everyone has accents when they speak
If English is a second language there is usually an accent and/or phrase rhythm and tone that stands out in varying degrees
Absolutely, we can even detect where they are from
And we can detect the English speakers accent too
Even if their accent in English is really good, there are a few ones I think I can identify: Spanish, Italian, French and Greek tend to be the most obvious, maybe German and Dutch too
Beyond that, I can only tell whether they are Nordic or Easter European, but I can't pinpoint the exact country, and for some reason I mix up Polish and Russian accents in English
I am Spanish, living in the UK and working in an international environment
Oh, and after 10 years in the UK I can identify some regional accents too: Brummie, Scouse, Scottish (but can't tell Glaswegian from Edinburgh or anywhere else), Landan, Manchester, Sommerset
It's fun trying to guess, it's like a game
Depends on where they're from
People from some places have stronger accents, for instance Spaniards, Italians and Greeks are usually easy to recognize, so are the French
For others I can usually tell they're foreign, but not where they're from
Of course there's always exceptions, people without the local accent
For instance, from what I've been told I have a "foreign" accent in English, but not the typical Spanish accent
And some people manage to fully get rid of their accents, usually by living in an English speaking country for a long enough time
It depends on how good they are, obvious examples with 2 of our politicians:
Pablo Iglesias, it's obvious he's not a native speaker: [
Ivan Espinosa, if I didn't know he's spaniard, I'd have thought he's an English native speaker: [
Those are extreme examples, of course, if someone sits in the middle I'm not sure if I'd know if he's a native speaker or not
Let me introduce you the Greeks
They have the exact same accent as Spaniards in English
I'm ashamed to say I have spoken Spanish to many Greeks because I was 100% sure they were Spaniards after I hear their English
In writing, one thing that gives away Germans is when they let slip "until" instead of "by". As in, "I need this until 3 PM" meaning "by 3 PM". I've seen Germans with an otherwise excellent command of English, written and spoken, do this
Why is it
I imagine you use the same German word for both
Just that
Double consonants does the music and and hand movements, the dance
It is an artsy way
I've been four time in Rome and the difference is not exactly subtle, but it is not difficult to adapt the pronunciation and speak a proper Italian, with accent
But yes, Spanish version of lo schiaccianoci is 'lo eschiakianochi', no rythm
Everybody cringes HARD at their own country's accent
But don't feel forced to switch back, faking a good accent is the first step to actually acquiring it
"Morder el polvo" (bite the dust) has in my experience the connotation of failing big at something, or being humiliated (you cannot sink lower), more than of dying (of course it might come from that, but I haven't seen that use) . For example, before a game: "we will make them bite the dust/Les haremos morder el polvo".
Alternativas: Estirar la pata/To stretch your leg
Irse al otro barrio/To go to the other neighborhood
Espicharla/(not sure how to translate this
Your dick falls off
Diñarla
Cascar[la]/To crack
For being dead already: Estar criando malvas/To be gardening mallow flowers
In Spanish "Moder el polvo"(bite the dust) is used when someone is defeated and humiliated
Is not used with the sense of death or is related to dying
&#x200B;
We say "estirar la pata" (Stretch/tense the leg
Also "pata" is non-human leg a human leg is called "pierna") or "irse al otro barrio" (go to other neighborhood) or "está descansando con los gusanos" (he/she is resting with the worms) or "está criando malvas" (growing mallow flowers) when someone die
Nothing, that expression does not exist in spanish, or if translated, it is an unnatural translation of the english version
Edit: since people are giving other examples, there is «estirar la pata», that means stretch the leg
We have "morder el polvo" - biting the dust - probably a transliteration from English, but usually people dont "bite", but "stretch their leg" instead - "Estirar la pata" - referring to rigor mortis
The best one for me: "irse al corral de los quietos" which roughly trasnlated as "going to the farmyard of the quiet ones". It's not funny translated, but whatever
Sería más como "going to the farmyard of the still ones", "quiet" sería de los silenciosos
yeah that's true
It means both quiet and still as I understand it
Our mealtimes
Lunch around 14:00
Dinner around 22:00
&#x200B;
Also, stores (not big chains) close at lunch time
Everybody is eating, is like +40 ºC outside, nobody is going to go out and buy stuff, plus it's not safe work under those conditions (think about construction workers or farmers, office work have a more "standard" timetable since they have AC) No reason to be open
Probably the "pass the bucket" culture
Its not as bad as in China, but a lot of people like to "pass the bucket" of a problem to a different person
Its what happens with lazy government workers a lot, that keep "bouncing" you from place to place
In spain whe have a thing called “persianas”, best Arab import you guys should check it out
Just came from another post and here It IS
One defining trait of Spain might be our playing cards
The more universally mainstream IS the french deck but in spain you'll usually see the spanish deck
It's not unique though, they also have them in Italy
Except for tuscany
for some reason
The last three Cars have special names "sota" "caballo" (Horse) and "rey"(King) [spanish deck]
This is both hilarious and sad
Basque is pretty similar in the sense that 80 is 20x4 or 40 is 20x2
It took me a while even to understand what you were saying
WHY DO YOU COUNT LIKE THAT IT'S DIABOLIC
Admired by citizens of other countries I must say
The late mealtimes are not only unique inside Europe, I think that we are weird on this matter all over the world
Anyway, I want  to take advantage of this to send a message to all our European friends & colleagues
Please, stop setting meeting at 14:00pm, please stop #DoItForSpain
Another unique thing might be our unusually long workdays and the absurd time we get for lunch break
I've been told It comes from mashing together morning and afternoon Jobs into one
For example my aunt works roughly from 9:30-7:00 but god save the 2 HOURS  lunch break
Most people actually leave the office to eat
we just Don't quite get the Sandwich lunch of the english
(For those curious, we also eat heavy dinners though normally lighter than the lunch)
Are you sure you're not Spanish
You cannot write Spain without pain
I think in Morocco they have our mealtimes
But in spain it would be more like 14:00 to 18:00 around where I used to live
Maybe because of the sun hours, we have same time zone but way more in the West so sun for us is stronger on different hours than yours
Yeah but in Spain if you eat at 12:00 you'll get some suspicious/funny looks
2 for lunch in spain IS even a bit early
Specially in summer
Most people eat between 2 and 3
And if you're working you can even eat at 4
idk, maybe
> which is because of tourists and trade etc
No, it's because Franco wanted to have the same time zone as his friend Hitler
Yeah, usually at 7:00 or 8:00
The lunch is a proper meal, not just a sandwich
>Siesta
Siesta is like sangria, not really a thing between spaniards
I'm spanish
don't compete with a portuguese on cod
you'll loose
If there's one thing they know how to cook IS bacalhau
And
>most production of salted cod (bacalao) is in Northern Europe (Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands)
Don't we eat THAT
Iceland and norway add Up to roughly 6 million and we (Portugal and Spain) add Up to 56
i'm sure cod IS a vital part of their cuisine but even taking into account (this measure IS taken from all fish spexies, couldnt find one for cod) we consume half the fish per capita we still consume almost 5 times more fish
and the portuguese LOVE their cod
production doesn't NECESARILY mean consumption
i just found an article that claims that Spain IS the biggest consumer of cod in the world
and i would bet we eat way less cod per capita than Portugal
Cod IS a religion there
We share some parts of our history, such as industrializing very late in our history (china did it even later than us)
So for example in China they keep pre-industrial era midday breaks, similar to our lunch breaks
Its not always a siesta but the workday is split in two, the morning shift and afternoon shift
"Sandwiches" are for breakfast
Dinner is something lighter than the lunch but it can be warm too
It's a lunch break
The story IS pretty funny because It shows how wrong the whole "siesta" stereotype IS (not that It didn't exist, It was a thing
until It wasn't)
We spanish work long workdays, we're talking from 9 to 19 but we have a huge "lunch break" in the middle (2 HOURS) and It just doesn't make sense NOW
however Spain wasn't always the same
About 70 years ago we were just escaping from a brutal civil War, most people were dirt poor (my grandparent worked since he was 14 and his mother was imprisoned for smuggling) and had two Jobs to compensate for the meeger salaries ....one in the morning and one in the afternoon
with time we got accostumed to this framework and when we started having one work instead of two the dirt was already settled on our strange workday
it's long and with a huge pause because it's really two
glued together
Yeah, 40 hours a week IS the legal barrier here
However many people work more especially in private companies
there's the "tradition" of not leaving office until the Boss leaves Office
thus my aunt normally gets home for late dinner 9:30-10:00
In reality most people work more than 40 hours a week it's just not counted that way
About a year ago they implemented a system of filing to avoid these "extra-hours" to no avail, people file out when the workday "ends" and then continue working
they also file in at given hours instead of when they start working
>However, then my shoe broke during the lunch break and I had no chance but to sit it out
And yeah
sorry about that
Excuse me, how do I get that flag
Surprisingly close to the situation in Spain, except for the dialect thing
Basque country
They don't speak a knoen language, have weird genetics
For geographic regions overall the canary islands, they are very far
There's an island which has a language of only whistles, and they have a quite interesting history, and an accent that sounds more Latinamerican than anything else
I would say Murcia
Despite having regions with different languages, in Murcia they speak the same language 99% of people speak, but it doesn't seems like it
They don't even have a dialect I would say, it is just a very strong accent
Everyone I've ever met from Murcia was a weird, but fun person
Everyone
Catalonia and the Vasc Country
Murcia
The Basque Country
Just the language makes them the odd one, not being related to any other in the world
Every map of Spain shows a region in the southeastern coast called "Murcia".
It actually doesn't exist, it's like an imaginary place where no one has ever been to, but everyone uses as a point of reference for what's weird or impossible
Quite the phenomenon
Vasque Country
They have their own language and we still don't know it's roots
It's the oddest one, I would say
In Spain there are two odd regions: Vasque Country and Extremadura
Vasque Country's own language is Euskera, one of the few Mediterranean languages that doesn't come from Latin: Euskera is a celtic language that has been talked since the Prerromanic period
Extremadura is a big rural region with a very little population, and living there is like burying yourself socially, as even the Internet doesn't work well
To be fair, we have a lot of weird regions in Spain
Also Basques are the Spanish equivalent of Russians, because their main stereotype is that they overdo and oversize everything
Also, they never fuck
Edit: [Spanish memes about Basques
] They are in Spanish, but you get the idea with the images
Wait how does having people from all over the place (ex Yugoslavia) translate into a stronger regional identity
Teruel
Apparently, it exists now
How many Basques are needed to change a lightbulb
Five, one holds the lightbulb and the other four spin the house
It's creative, I'll give you that

Leonardo Dantés
Tamara AKA Ambar AKA Yurena
&#x200B;
I refuse to search them on youtube and its recomendation algorithms
We have some of those as well but from bigger reality shows and better video production, even if the music is as shitty
[For example]
wtf really
jajaja
Nope her videos became famous because she was famous in Spain
Used to be a big star in children TV shows and everyone loved to laugh at how far she had fallen
Ah so it's the Bulgarian equivalent to reggaeton
I wish it was
My mother used to say "Kids will have sex anyway, I prefer them to do it safely under my roof than on a dark alley or a car in the streets".
That said of course you closed the door and tried to be quiet, but my parents knew perfectly what we were doing and there was no problem
It's generally ok to have your SO stay for the night from time to time, as long as it's a more or less serious relationship
People aren't loud in general, even if they live alone, as far as I know
It's very rare to hear your neighbors through the walls at night, in general
Our walls are made of bricks, we don't usually use wood for building houses, or anything else in general, so noise doesn't travel that easily
Also, most people that are very active sexually or want to be autonomous tend to prefer to rent a room in a shared apartment with people of a similar age range (it's cheap and their parents are not going to be around)
This is super common for college students, especially if they're studying in a different city from the one they come from
Since we have proper scholarships, people with low income doesn't have to pay tuition and some get some extra money to cover part of their expenses during the year, so they spend it on the rent
They're not loans, they don't have to return them in any way, but they do need to pass most of their subjects to keep being eligible for the scholarship the next year
While we generally have smaller houses, the living space is way better distributed than in a house with several floors
We also tend to manage our storage space way better that people from the USA, from what I've seen
People never really share bedrooms unless they're a couple or really small kids
Most families have at least 3 bedrooms in their house (income doesn't make much of a difference in this, since most apartments here are built that way), and usually less than 3 kids
Same in Spain, and my family tends to also scream across the house or announce before going into a closed room
Roughly the same for Spain, but "conservative" parents may not allow it not* because of religion but "respecting your family". Most of us just wait to have our parents out of home to sneak in
Maybe that's why we have many motels and 2-star hotels (hostales) everywhere
I swear I've heard that exact phrase before because all my friends commented once that this was exactly what their parents told them all
The Kingdom Council
Do you know the council in Game of Thrones
Well, that's it
It was created in 1552 by the emperor Charles V. Nowadays it's formed by former ministers and presidents
The council is asked by the Government about laws and important issues to give its opinion (in a technical way, not political)
It's  usually considered a way to give money to retired politicians
or a good way to share their expertise
>- Sea-Airport Cuxhaven / Nordholz GmbH: We have an airport without a flight plan that is just barely in use and fund it with 8 million Euros ...
Sounds like Spain to me
Yes
That one
The one who controlled half Europe
Charles V probably copied that from Burgundy for each of his realms
It doesn't have lyrics so it's kinda shitty
You'll be killed for singing the Spanish national anthem, tho
You would be speechless
well
it has no lyrics, and the melody is pretty mediocre, so
I don't like it
We (all) should learn of the DDR's anthem, that song gives me tingles every time I listen to it
An anthem with no lyrics is absurd
It should have lyrics
It should have lyrics
It's a boring military march with no lyrics I feel no attachment to
We should've got back the Himno de Riego after Francoism
It isn't realy a republican anthem, it's a constitutionalist anthem that was the anthem during the Liberal Triennium and the two republics
It has a very Marseillaise feel about fighting to defend the motherland's freedom and it came from the people
It wasn't a march handpicked by a king 250 years ago
Feel like pure shit I just want the [Himno de Riego] back
It's the best, you don't even have to learn the lyrics
Well there are only two versions you can sing
The fun but very disrespectful version, or Riego’s hymn (which is the republican hymn, so you can see the problem with that)
At some point in the future, I’d love to have a hymn that isn’t a military march, and actually had words to it
But all things considered, I’d have to wait quite a while for that
At least it has easy lyrics
LOLOLOLO
But it's the same anthem that we had in the 1st Spanish Republic but without lyrics, so that makes it a good anthem for me
And in the other hand, I wouldn't like some patriotic lyrics in the Spanish anthem
See that´s why ours doesnt have any lyrics and we just scream LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOOLOLOLO
Yeah it was a joke
I live in Euskadi so you know, if you wear something Spain related here you'll get some weird looks
As long as I never have to sing or hear again the Marta Sánchez version I'm okay with it
That song still haunts me
Anyone that's proud of being Spanish or wears something with the Spanish flag gets called fascist, racist and everyone assumes that you're an intolerant extreme right voter
Just for showing the Spanish flag yes
Vuelvo a casa, a mi amada tierra
***shivers violently***
That's just simply not true
Just look at the news
Yeah but you're saying it like there isn't a reason for that
I literally haven't said anything, mostly because I think it's a complex issue for people who probably are not up to the news here
I'll have to write the Bible to explain every side and perspective the problem has
I can agree on that but just know that if someone calls you a facist either they're a extreme leftist or they're right
No one should call you facist for liking your country
Agree completely but nowadays it seems like everyone is so mad and full of hate that we no longer tolerate each other anymore
Probably I see it this way because I live in Euskadi and you surely know that issue is specially problematic here
I'm not sure about san Marino, but i think i've seen a liechtensteiner around and there's an andorran too
The thing i love in this sobreddit it is there is a lot of different cultures
Yeah i stuck for the community
This is the nicest most quirky sub i've seen in reddit
Everyone IS there to help, respectfull, attentive
People are here to enjoy and learn
I really LOVE that
This man, absolutely this
I remember there was a liechtensteiner because someone just randomly asked him about how his country was
It was one of the first things i remember from this sub
In late summer/early fall maybe six to ten
In winter four or five
4 or so
Most people in Spain have one of the [multiple Nocilla collectible glass containers] that Nocilla comes in
they’ve been around forever
Paelleras maybe
&#x200B;
A paella specific pan
[Persianas]  I don't know if it's true or not, but as far as I know in northern Europe you don't have these kinds of blinds, without which we Spaniards can't live hehehe
old people like to put statues of christ on the cross or of saints and have a lot of ceramics at home, they might also have pictures from weddings from the family, or from the [first communion] of the kids
Also [palillos] hand fans
that's pretty accurate
They are relatively common in Spain
I've been in a lot of houses with one (and of course they are in every bar)
"This thing" is a finnish invention
Everybody have one of these here
A danish butter cookies container filled with sewing supplies
&#x200B;
Fun fact, "Pryca" (supermarket chain) does not exist anymore, closed in 2000
They are super common in Spain and Portugal too
Funnily enough not in France despite inventing them
I've always been weirded out by those in movies
Never seen one in Europe
why mold would grow there
>Almost, except for Portugal I don't remember any other country where bidets are present in more than 90% of households
Spain
He meant that the name of the pan is paella
All the houses I know have one
Maybe the places you went were too new or tourist oriented
well, TIL
I always called the pan paellera
and paella is the food
It is mandatory in Spain
The project has to be aproved with at least one "whole" bathroom
"Whole" includes bidet
in dutch PLATYPUS is calles Vogel-Beck-Dier = Bird-beak-animal
simmilarly Lignin (stuff that makes trees hard) is houtstoff = woodstuff
We call it «fris fris» becuase of the sound it makes
Reminds of jeux vidéo, instead of vidéo jeux
It’s the same in Spainish “hacer caca” / “hacer pipi”
The Spanish word for ladybug can also mean 'gay'
We call them zebra crossings in Spanish too
Grammar*.
Also in Spanish and catalan, but it's not that much defined in some cases
I'm English we are taught the specific order they should be given, in Spanish I think there's not a specific universal order, but it still exists
For example, "la gran y veloz avioneta" is ok, but "la veloz y gran avioneta" sounds weird
I agree with you completely
I have seen, and written too, entire paragraphs in Spanish that consist of only a long, complex, and convoluted sentence that, however, sounds completely logical to the native Spanish speaker, more used to compound sentences than the average English speaker, that prefers the more "start and stop", so to speak, structure of their language
In Spanish it's considered I correct and hardly seen in written form, but somewhat usual in spoken language in some regions
And in Spain we had Gabriel Rufián bringing [a printer] and at a different point [a pair of handcuffs] He is like that, the parliament's buffoon
The printer was about the illegal referendum in Catalonia
The regional law that called for the referendum violated about half a dozen laws both in form and in content, so the referendum was disallowed, etc
Rufián, being Rufián, took the printer to the Parliament to explain that the Catalans could print the ballots themselves ("with this humble republican Samsung printer" he said)
As for the handcuffs, he used them in November 2017 just as props to say "I wish one day Mariano Rajoy will wear this".
He's from a Catalan separatist party, I find it a bit more unlikely than those examples
Rufián is an MP for Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, a Catalan nationalist party that in Congress only gets some 4-5 MPs, so it is not going to happen
In Spanish it's "have sex", but then we also have "make the love", so
In Spanish we have sex but we make THE love
We are more romantic and we have sex (tener sexo), but we do/make love (hacer el amor)
The have sex "tener sexo" is probably one of the worst recent additions to Spanish from English
It sounds horrible
I’d say “practicar sexo” is more popular
Is it an English loan-word/-expression
I thought it was Spanish proper, as in "tener relaciones sexuales" ----> "tener sexo". While you can say "mantener relaciones sexuales" but not "mantener sexo". But I agree it sounds awful xD
Idealmente
"Tener relaciones sexuales" is fine, that's what a ginecologist would say
"Tener sexo" is a literal translation from English
But to be fair, we have no elegant word for "follar".
> "Tener sexo" is a literal translation from English
Hum, I am not entirely convinced, but maybe you are right
I have tried to search for an etimology on Google but nothing comes up
>But to be fair, we have no elegant word for "follar".
Yeah, that's the real problem here xD
&#x200B;
I have found instances as far back as 1975 in some Spanish [corpora] I don't think it's an English imitation
But if it is it's well settled in common usage already
They're seen as flowers, you can sometimes find some baked goods with poppy seeds, but they're not that common
So if you ask a Spaniard about poppies, the thing they'll be thinking about is the flower, mostly because there's a point of the year where they seem to be growing everywhere
For us they're just [pretty flowers that grow on the fields] People like to take selfies and pictures on them
We don't really do anything else with them, as far as I know, they just come and go with the seasons, they're part of the landscape
I guess some breads might have poppy seeds along with many other seeds, but I don't know for sure
First as a flower, then as source of opium and lastly as a condiment
We Don't use poppy Seeds that much, you might find them in some pastries, but it's pretty weird
However, I've Heard we're the top 1 legal exporter of opiates
We have fields upon fields of poppies from Madrid to Valencia
So why do we associated It to the flower
in spring they are EVERYWHERE
In the train rails, in your garden, in between the cobblestones of your street, in the fields, in between the rocks
Just in Madrid i think we have 3 or 4 different species
Oh, cool, I didn't know that
I just googled this out of curiosity and apparently Spain is one of the biggest producers of legal opium in Europe, so I guess we do have that variety as well
You were right about the one in the fields being *Papaver rhoeas*.
I also found out that some people here use this wild variety for salads and tea, just the petals, which apparently don't have enough concentration of psychotropics to do much to people
It's interesting, because I had always thought they were dangerous for the human body
We have the black novels about detectives and crimes, and pink for romantic novels
In journalism we have pink press for gossip and yellow press for media using eye-catching and even fake headlines for increased sales instead of well-researched news and articles
Salmon press is the economy and finances sections on newspapers (because is the color of the paper used for those sections)
I always heard the economic pages in newspapers referred as "salmon pages" (btw that reminds me of yellow pages phonebook and I wonder if in other countries they also have a phone guide with yellow pages
) but never as salmon press, however I searched it up and apparently it's actually called like that, TIL
The Spanish company is called *Páginas Amarillas* (yellow pages) as well
The part for businesses and service advertisements is yellow, and the part for private landlines is white (Páginas Blancas), but most people don't put their private landlines on the phonebook anymore, because it makes you vulnerable to scams
Also, most people has switched to the internet nowadays, and so has the Páginas Amarillas company
Idk if this counts but in spanish there’s a game where you talk normal but with only using one vowel
Like for example: I saw a blue car
Vi un coche azul (normal)
Va an cacha azal (only using the a vowel)
In Spanish my father told me about a language game about repeating every syllable but adding a p, like this:
Instead of saying "Gilipollas" (which is something similar to dumbass)
You had to say "Gipilipipopollaspas" repeating the last syllable and adding a p.
It's actually very difficult to talk like that but my father could, just gotta practice
Does it really exist
I always thought it was something made up in The Simpsons' dub to Castilian Spanish
I've never heard of this before
I've never heard of it before
We could really have done without Franco, the spanish dictator who started spain’s only civil war in 1936
He led to social and economical repercussions that lasted decades
Stop spending gold like crazy and actually worrying about Dutch people might have avoided the disastrous defeat against the Netherlands
Also if the people were a little smarter and religion didn't play such an important role in Spain, I would be happy with Napoleon winning in Spain, or the Spanish winning and the king accepts the constitution
It would have helped prevent the slow downfall that our country had and could have prevented many conflicts
If we hadn't fucked up, Spain and Portugal would've probably remained united under the house of Austria, and the Iberian peninsula would've mostly ruled the world
All of South America, most of North America, Africa's coastline, the Philippines, a bit of India, the south of Italy, Sicily and The Netherlands
And whatever else we could've had next
Definitely the civil war
I wonder how our country might be now if some right wing generals hadn't decided to fuck things up for 40 years
Instead we got Franco people in our highest courts and the Franco family is a freaking Noble House
A continuous event or a single event
If it was a continuous event it would be the inflation of the gold and silver brought back from America to Spain, wich left the kingdom of spain almost as quickly as it entered, while the actual kingdom's economy and agriculture didnt have much efforts of improvement
If it was a single event, it would be the Treaty of Utrech
Ignoring unforeseeable consequences, I wish the civil war had ended differently
Putting my own political opinions aside, I feel that we had a late start into the modern era due to the lack of democracy until the late 70s.
Probably would make the empire's colonies management better
That the Civil War didin't start
We may have entered the World War, but we wouldn't have had a dictatorship
Exactly what I was going to write
What I wanted to say or alternatively not prevent the drowning that almost occurred in his childhood
I think without Franco there would have been no civil war
I wish he hadn’t risen to power
I never said that's what I wanted
If I could change something, it would be that, because it's the best thing I could think of  that:
A) Didn't relate to our last civil war, because that's too easy
B) Made the biggest impact to our current world
Think for a moment of how different the world would've been
The USA would probably not exist
I don't want to have colonies
In fact, even if what I gave as an example were to be real, I'm pretty sure they'd eventually become independent
As they should
But I can see howmy original comment could be interpreted that way
fair, then just not having that war but along with it i guess comes the dictatorship
People is usually completely unaware of this so most British and Spaniards might tell you "no, we walk either side" but I use to go to the UK because of work and I wondered why I was continuously almost bumping into people in those kind of encounters in the office while in Spain that just flows naturally (for me)
also if I spent more than usual in the UK, I was finding my moves more rough back in Spain so I became conscious of this as well and yes
Spaniards tend to walk on the right side and British tend to walk on the left side
Also I found that London is completely mixed in this regard so it might be harder to observe there than in other parts of the UK
Probably they receive much more international visitors in their offices there so "unconscious rules" have adapted to that
Not written on stone but repeated enough times for not being a coincidence
The [Don Quixote] books are a brutal satire of the [wandering knight archetipe] which was very popular in Europe at the time
Aside from that, the closest thing to gunslingers we ever had in this country were the [bandoleros] (brigands) , which, even though had actually existed for a long time in one form or another (a famous earlier one is mentioned in Don Quixote), reached their peak in the XIX century after the [wars against the French invasion] Their character was greatly romanticised partly due to the overlap between actual criminals and the guerrilla warriors that fought the Napoleonic troops, and also because they were seen as rebels against the [often despotic governments] that followed
There were songs and poems dedicated to them, and in the 70s there was even a TV show about the adventures of a group of bandits lead by Curro Jimenez, who was based on a [real-life brigand]
In Spain it would be a Knight or a mercenary in the middle ages
Or both, as El Cid was
Great answer for Spain
It might be useful to add a comment here about the more general archetype of the homeless wanderer that uses wit and deception to try unsuccesfully to go up the social ladder, and by chance or intentionally helps fellow people from the lower classes of society
The Lazarillo de Tormes novel or El Buscon by Quevedo are first examples of this
There is also the wandering sword for hire type from the renaissance like Capitán Alatriste and Íñigo Montoya from "the princess bride". I think that's more stereotypically Spanish
Yup - just to add on, this genre is called picaresca, because this kind of person is called "pícaro", which could be translated as "naughty" "rogue" or "rascal".
Uh, I thought every country in the European continent (America aswell) write them when referring to centuries
You use 17th instead of XVII
Oh, I'm happy to hear that :)
AFAIK is the most translated book in the world behind The Bible
>I wonder about the Spanish Conquistador
It is not a thing in Spain
In Spain we could say that we had our Wild West during the Reconquista, in the border of the Duero
It was a land of no one
Both the Christians and the Moors did skirmishes in that terrain, or even getting into each other's territories to loot and even kill the people who was living there
So I think that is what best fits
I don't know
I have just found out they exist xd
The modern version are the [Spanish Maquis] who fought against the dictatorship
Those navajas were used by bandoleros, outlaws that stole from the rich
The were quite a thing in Andalucía (South of Spain)
There are many legends and songs about them
Hollywood even made a movie with Charlton Heston as the Cid and Sophia Loren as Julieta (his wife)
But most of the story is not real History
He was more a mercenary than a crusader against the Moors
I would say the same, yes
>why would we translate roman numerals for when we have numbers
Ask you king, Carl XVI Gustaf, he is not called Carl 16 Gustaf after all
Really
I have never seen written centuries as "siglo 3" or "siglo 17" it even hurts seeing it
That's true, indeed
I mean it's not that it's hard, but I agree with the American
It's pretty unnecessary, just an old tradition that's stuck around
We have some regulates prices for electricity, and recently some price regulation for mask and hidroalcoholic gel
The prices of the physical books in Spain are untouchable
The price is what is set by the manufacturer and you cannot run promotions or anything like that to "protect the industry". In my opinion this have a negative impact on the industry and customers
When Churchill sentenced us to 30 years of fascist tyranny because oranges grown with slave labor are cheaper
>  Roosevelt slept through the whole meeting
I´ve read somewhere that Roosevelt was ~~somehow sick (some even say Spanish Flu) and he had high fever and other sympthoms~~ which made him unable to focus on the conference, resulting in his decision taking being pretty much null
If true or not, we will never know
*EDIT: missed up with end of 1st World War and Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt was just old*
I´ve read somewhere that Roosevelt ~~was somehow sick (some even say Spanish Flu) and he had high fever and other sympthoms which made him unable to focus on the conference~~, resulting in his decision taking being pretty much null
If true or not, we will never know
*EDIT: missed up with end of 1st World War and Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt was just old*
That doesn't make sense, Spanish flu refers to the 1918 pandemic
Roosevelt was just in very poor health by February 1945, he would die just two months later
>we had our own war and our own fascists
Welp, they had already handed our asses back
But we definitely had more important matters to take care of, like a draconian fascist regime with a bomb-proof leader
Oh my god, I completely messed up
Thanks for clarifying
Roosevelt was probably just old and not in best shape
True
But it's a shame, what a wasted opportunity to give Franco a premature end at Nuremberg
Or maybe it'd make the allies lose, who knows
Any country other than Italy and Greece unemployment rates
I guess from the the UK, allowing its members to do a referendum for independence without getting our ass kicked
The working life of Norway
The efficiency and seriousness of the German Government, man the Spanish government is the least efficient thing there is
The bravery of the French to fight back when government/corporations/elites step on our rights or achievements
Urban planning of the Nordics (SPACING BETWEEN BUILDINGS), I hate how everything in Spain is built so close together when most of the country is empty
Dense =\= cramped

6% I see, not bad
Actually it's Catalonia but yep :(
Solution: Just abolish politics
Ancap gang
Corrupt politicians get rid of decent people not decent people get rid of corrupt politicians nono
I don't know if it's necessary
Europe already has more forest land that before the Industrial Revolution
Maybe we should focus on protecting what we have from fores and recovering what we lose now
Haven't they stopped doing that
Cubalibre
Now seriously, there are several and depends on the region:
\- [Pacharán]
\- [Licor 43]
\- Licor de café (Coffee liqueur)
\- [Orujo]
\- [Ron miel] (Honey rum)
We have so many
Aguardiente (Firewater) - Strong liquor made from fermented juice, grain or vegetables
Anis - Liquor made from anisette
Licor Cafe (Cofffee liquor) - Sweet chocolatey-like liquor from north-west Spain
When I went to Budapest I bought Unicum for my boyfriend
It really is an acquired taste
And the bottles look very nice
That's right
I just came to add [this map] in case anyone wants to know more
They are more regional than national
But we have a fuck ton of regional ones
I didn't know that either
I know most countries have their own gin and whisky though
Do you think English is hard
This question is obviously geared towards non-native speakers, but every answer is welcomed
I've seen this trend on the internet of native English speakers who think English is hard
It's not that I speak many languages, only English and Spanish, and I studied a little bit of French in high school, but I think English is quite comfortably on the easier side
Spelling is all over the place and reeeally inconsistent, but leaving that aside I can't find much else that is actually difficult
Verbs are simple, sentence structure is straightforward, there are no cases, no tones, the alphabet is simple
What do you think
English is definitely the easiest
No gendered articles, no bended verbs, oh and no separate form just to express feelings
As you might notice, I have a kind of love/hate relationship with Spanish since I have to learn it for school
I think it depends to which language are you comparing it and which is your native tongue
I agree which you that spelling is obviously the hardest part, but you eventually learn it
Being a student of Japanese I can say that English is pretty easy
I might be biased because I'm a fluent English speaker, but I don't think it's the worst
Sure, writing is really weird, but English doesn't have genders nor does it have 7 different endings for verbs based on who you're talking to, which can also changed based on the tense
Overall, I think it's pretty tame
I've tried to learn English and German and English is way easier to learn
I think it's stupid that writing has nothing to do with how it's pronounced
SO more stupid than really hard
That of course plays a part
When I was in high school I listened to music in English, watched all kind of media in English, from random YT videos to Top Gear, played games in English
For French I had to go out of my way to find content, which I never did, by the way
I was about to reply, from the inbox, that I wass surprised that you found Spanish easier
Then I clicked and saw your flair
Yeah, that's what I meant
I had to do it, but I never did
Not "I never found it" but "I never, or almost never, actually tried to do it".
Yeah, I was reading twitter earlier regarding the passing of Paulo Gonçalves and I understood everything easily
I imagine that if I had the interest, I could learn the phonetics with a little bit of time and with that I could at least get people to understand what I'm saying in Portugal
People explaining how they bankrupted because they sprained an ankle
There's a lot of MLM in EUrope as well
At least in my country I remember it being covered in TV shows of investigative journalism and the news a couple of times so I guess it's important enough to be talked about by mainstream media
Oh, MLMs are also in europe
Specially herbalife
They also (try to)  recruit people through job offers
Why do you assume everyone outside the US learn british english
Yep nobody likes superheros in enlightened europe
That was normal when I was that age
I still see it normal
Portuguese insecure nationalism is hilarious
Movies, Tv shows, music, videogames, other forums
Also I think some countries teach american english in school, just like in the US they teach mostly mexican spanish
BTW american english is as legitimate as the british one, and the most spoken

More the "ortugal is older and more unified than Spain and we beaten in wars multiple times having a Portuguese soldier to 5 or 10 Spaniards" thing that portuguese users like to say every single time spanish protuguese relations are discussed
"facts" like folktales of a baker woman beating 10 spanish soldiers lol
The one I can think of is Beijing
In Spanish, the most accepted way to say it is "Pekín" and a person from Beijing is "pekinés", not "beijinés". If you say Beijing people will likely understand you, but our Language Academy recommends saying Pekín.
Apparently this difference is due to the different system used for the transcription of the Chinese alphabet to the Latin alphabet
I don't know if Peking is also used in English, I only heard Beijing
Other cities are quite similar or literal transcriptions like "London/Londres, Rome/Roma, Seville/Sevilla, New York/Nueva York, Cape Town/Ciudad del Cabo
English Channel = Canal de la Mancha
Falklands = Malvinas
Cornualles = Cornwall
Lovaina = Leuven
Amberes = Antwerp
La Haya = Den Hagg
Colonia = Köln
Copenhague = København
But the true winner is
Bolduque = 's-Hertogenbosch
It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize 'Antwerp' and 'Amberes' are the same city
In Spanish a lot of cities' names are changed so that they're pronounceable, like Aachen is Aquisgrán (that's a weird one) Moskvá (moscow) is Moscú, Bruxelles is Bruselas, Edimburgh is Edimburog, Köln is Colonia, Warsaw is Varsovia, Krakow is Cracovia
and a long long etc
An as a final curiosity, most Dutch/Flemish important big cities are still called by the names they had back when they were Spain
Like Maastricht is Mastrique and Leuven/Louvain is Lovaina
Brugge/Bruges is Brujas,  Lüttich/Liège is Lieja
And so on
I usually get confused with Geneva/Genève/Genf (Ginebra in Spanish) and Genoa (Génova in Spanish) because the name of the Swiss city in English and French is very similar to the name in Spanish of the Italian city
So if I read or play a videogame that speaks about Geneva, I must do an effort to not confuse it with Genoa
Same in Spanish: Varsovia
Yeah there are some Dutch and Belgian cities where there is a name in Spanish for them, thanks Charles V I guess
- Groningen = Groninga
- Nigmejen = Nimega
Wait until you google Bolduque
Oh talking about Warsaw you just reminded me of Wroclaw
In Spanish it's called "Breslavia".
> 's-Hertogenbosch
I guess the answer is "history", but how did that happen
In Spanish, the Thames is el Támesis
Funny thing is in Spanish is "Bolonia", not "Boloña"
Minga is pee pee in Spanish lol
I use maps
me because it's way better with offline stuff
But that's just me, not my country
(Spain)
In Spain CNIG/IGN (our National geographical studies institute) has two tools [Iberpix] and [Signa]
However, they are mainly used for cadastral consults and GIS data sourcing rather than for the regular citizen to move around
Our most popular hiking maps app, [Oruxmaps] and Wikiloc source data from there
We used to have two or three different mapping services, but Google Maps was way better at the time so they took the whole cake
Not really
However, people tend to use local apps to plan their public transport journeys instead of Citymapper or Moovit, although they also have Spanish cities
[Example]
When you are from a country where the name of the country starts with a different letter in your language than in English you have the same problem, the country list are usually a mess so even with the webpage in Spanish sometimes Spain is in the S written with E in the Spanish webside, sometimes in the S written with S, sometimes it's in the E written with S in an English website, it's always a mistery
Probably because in Spanish americans are called 'estadounidenses' (also 'americanos')
I understand them, it is not nice that one country uses the name of the whole continent only for themselves
Inglaterra se usa un montón. Reino Unido también bastante
Gran Bretaña diría que es lo que menos se usa, aunque sí se dice mucho "británico/a".
Post Data: Para traducir "usually" es más natural decir "normalmente" o "habitualmente" que "usualmente".
Me alegro mucho :)  Sigue practicando y cada día será más fácil
¿Has leído algún libro ya
Si lees un libro que conozcas bien, seguramente aprendas mucho
Wow really
In Spain it gets shortened as UE all the time
Interesting, what part of Spain are you from
I've only ever seen in written UE but never said that way
I'm from Madrid, but I did mean written
It depends
Is it peninsular Spanish or south american Spanish
In Spain they didn't respect the spelling and changed the song
So you basically get a song with letters that don't relate to the lyrics
In south america they say "Well in english it's said fun so
" and they spell it with F for "familia". U for "unión" and N as in "don't stop having fun anywhere".
Not all of us do, trust me
I don't think it's fixed and it depends on the teacher
I learned how to write in cursive first, then when I was around 9-10 switched to printed-like and nobody cared, then when I was 12-13 a teacher made us write in cursive again because "every time you lift the pen from the paper, it's a 0
1 second of life you're losing".
Now I write in cursive if it's notes to myself, and print-like if I know other people are going to read it
We learnt cursive and I also find crazy that some people don't start learning with it
Although a lot of people tend to mix cursive and printed
I still write everything on cursive
They teach first in uppercase printed-like and then in lowercase cursive
But that is only how they teach
The teachers generally doesn't care about the writting style afterwards, so people can write one way, the other, or in a mix of both (which I think is the most common case)
In elementary school we learn cursive until ~11 years
Then it's your choice
I don't even remember how I was taught to write at school
I join sometimes some letters, but I never join other letters
A supposedly good paella at the center of Madrid
British owned and staffed companies providing outrageous expensive services for British locals in souther Spain / Costa del Sol
Real examples: installing a TV antenna por 800 euros instead of 200
3 AC installations for 3500 euros instead of 2000, et cetera
Maybe overpriced stuff
However we do have some kind of touristic reputation and most people will not try to scam you
Doesn't mean it never happens but I've never seen or heard anything
Probably all the bad stuff happens at Barcelona
However as someone who is studying tourism in València listen to my wise words:
If you want to eat paella bear something in mind
A paella takes time
A good restaurant will ask you to make a reservation or to wait a few hours if you want one
If they don't do that and they give you one straight away, it's not a good paella
Most of the places already have paellas cooked and they will sell you that (they cook them all in the morning and just sell them at any time)
Always ask how long it will take
Anything less than 30 minutes or even an hour is not "fresh paella".
Great post, very useful
I guess the main problem in Spain is pickpocketing, so put your phone/wallet in a safe place and keep your attention on it them when you're in the subway or in a crowded place
Most people in Spain never touch others when walking, so it would be a good idea to check your pockets if someone ever bumps into you
In Madrid or Barcelona you have to watch out for people in motorcycles, because there has been an increase of people stealing bags/purses from their bikes recently
There are other scams made for tourists, mostly related to the lack of knowledge of our language (places advertising *zumo de naranja* for 2€ and asking for 5€ for orange juice, that is, the same thing)
As long as you stick to official tour guides you're probably safe though
Oh, and avoid taxis in Madrid
They're legal and safe, but they tend to pick the "scenic route" (taking the longest route so they can charge you extra)
They're fine in most of the other cities, as far as I've seen
Also, don't accept flowers or any trinkets from people on the street
They will come back for payment, although you can certainly refuse and give it back to them (or leave it on the floor if they won't take it back)
I've paid a 9€ pint in Paris, I think that one is universal XD
It's possible, you just have to find a restaurant in more hidden streets that aren't right next to the main sights
Well, I don't know this for certain, but I think my country takes care of my healthcare even when I'm travelling to other countries
It does in France and Portugal at least, but I'm not sure about countries outside the EU
Yes, I have the card
I suspected it wouldn't work outside the EU
It's a shame
I'll have to check my home insurance, maybe I'll be lucky and it would be included
Thanks for the tip
Well, I checked it out and it only covers the EU countries and a few other European ones
I do have to pay private healthcare if I go outside of Europe, if that gives you any consolation
One of the best tapas in my opinion is galician style octopus
Bed of potatoes, the sliced up octopus and lots of smoked paprika and olive oil
If ypu don't cook it propperly tho eating octopus is like chewing on a rubber ball
I didn’t even know this was controversial lol it’s super common in Spain
I don't think it is any weirder than any other kind of fish or seafood
The only thing I find gross is eating raw oysters, which, ironically, is something many Americans love
Different cultural beats, I guess
There are very common in Spain, but I don't eat aliens (including sea cockroaches, even if they are quite prestigious in my area)
On the other hand, a friend of mine used to do some research with octopuses and he always told how amazingly intelligent they are
When I asked him how could he then eat them, he answered "I eat them to get their powers
It's a very common dish in Northern Spain
It's fabulous served at galician style
I don't think it is disgusting but they are very intelligent creatures and I feel sad for them
I had them as a kid
But I've been vegetarian for almost a decade now, and it does obviously repulse me
One of the best things in this world: "Pulpo a la gallega".
Literally just had [octopus for dinner] its a pretty common dish in my region and i love it
I wholeheartedly agree
[Pulpo a la gallega]
I’ve tried it dozens of times when I ate animals, and I have never understood why it’s so loved and overpriced
Without paprika it wouldn’t have any flavour
Just like seafood
Any good squid or cuttlefish is way better than octopus
But raw oysters aren’t something alien to Spanish food culture at all
in fact it’s the way they are usually eaten in Galicia, raw with some lemon juice perhaps and a glass of Albariño nearby, aren’t they
Fried rings
I think you may be reffering to squid
Eat your fears
Own them
Squids are about as intelligent as octopuses
We call it pulpo a la gallega but yeah it's amazing :)
Yeah, it's cool, I love polvo a feira (octopus ala galician)
Those eucalyptus forests are previously burnt forests, they planted eucalyptus because they grow fast but they aren't good for the land nor they are the original trees
They are completely different products
I don't think you can compsre them
They are just both cephalopods
And i disagree
Good octopus has a very nice texture and great sweet taste
Not bland at all in my opinion
Same hahaha I never understood why is so loved
Yes, octopus and calamari are different
In Spain we eat a lot of both
They are not alien but they are only a common dish in very specific areas, mostly in the north (where you can eat them shortly after being caught), whereas you can find octopus basically everywhere in Spain --whether it's properly cooked or not it's a different story
Similarly, I like snails in sauce but I understand it's a very localised dish not everybody has tasted, and it sounds disgusting if you didn't grew up with it like I did
Don't you have octopus in your sea
If you don't maybe that's why
>they planted eucalyptus because they grow fast
They plant eucalyptus to make paper
it's a huge deal in Galicia
They are planted for paper
Well, not for me
I don’t think they have a taste, at all
The texture is just meh
and my family loves them, I have tried them at many different restaurants that were supposed to have great octopus
Don’t get me wrong, I could eat octopus if I was hungry and wouldn’t have anything else
It’s not that I don’t like it
It’s just flavourless: even the boiled potatoes under the pulpo have more flavour
I see your point, but I’m pretty sure that eating alive oysters is actually even more uncommon and niche in other oyster producing countries
Look at France or China, for example, they tend to be cooked
Same for the USA, eating seafood there is proportionally way more unusual and specific of certain locations there than in Spain
I’m quite sure that the average USA citizen is way more hesitant to eat raw oysters than the average Spaniard
Snails in sauce
So good
You're right, every summer they do
No need, it's Galicia
They pour the petrol
Eucalyptus are used to make paper because they grow fast
I'm not sure but they may be forbidden, Euskadi has always took really well care of its forests
That happens pretty much everywhere
Average there refers to the amount of seafood per capita that someone eats
Perhaps it wasn’t the best expression, but what I meant is that the amount of seafood eaten per capita in the USA is way below than in Spain, so knowing this figure and the idiosyncrasy of both places, if you pick a random Spaniard and a random USA citizen, the former is more likely to be comfortable eating raw oysters than the latter
I may be wrong though
Spain eats a LOT of Fish, 56
2 pounds per year per capita (The US is at 16
That's probably because even in Madrid, which IS 300km away, we eat It regularly
Fish has been carried for centuries to the interior
There's traditional cod dishes all around Spain, even 200km inland
in the coast they eat fish  non stop
In the interior we eat It very often
Yes but in summer temperatures are higher and it rains less
>And if you look at this map,
I find It hard to read though, as It doesn't take into account population
Most dark spots are just there bacause if inmense cities like los Angeles
Can you find which state has more consumption per capita (no Hawaii included)
>Oh, one more thing: In some interior states, like Wisconsin, fresh-water fish is regularly consumed, especially on Fridays
But that's not seafood, so it doesn't count
In Spain we Don't eat much fresh water fish
In The northern plateau it's more traditional, but most of the country sticks to saltwater
>The center of the US is over 2,000km from the ocean
Yeah, but in Europe 300km IS quite far
Bern (switzerland) IS roughly that far away from the coastline
Found out the spanish figures
Though
they're on spanish, so i'll just lay my thoughts on them
Basically the consumption IS very even along the territory with a peak of 28
64 kg per capita and a low of 19
04 kg in the peninsula
The outlier IS actually a set of islands
The canaries, somewhat ironically, have the lowest consumption per capita at 15
72 kg
So in conclusion, there DOESN'T seem to be a strong correlation between being near the coast and eating fish and seafood
In fact castilla y León a landlocked region IS second only to Galicia, while Andalucía, murcia and Valencia are all coastal and bellow average
Funnily enough, there seems to be a north/south divide with more consumption in the north, even in non coastal regions like Aragon and Castille and Leon
Edit: i looked a bit into It, and the coastal northeast, the region which eats more seafood in the US IS at 9kg per year
As i said, we eat a LOT of seafood
It used to be the town of Lepe but I don’t know if it is anymore
All of them
We have a lot of funny stereotypes for every region
The most common are probably the Basque country for brute force, Catalonia for being cheap and Madrid for bad tourists (*domingueros*)
I’ll say Murcia (it doesn’t exist)
Murcia
In Spain is Murcia
What the fuck is that
Spreading disinformation
I see
I lived there as a student for 6 months so idk how valid my opinion is but I thi k that the US offers a great job market and real good money if you study certain things but I would not move there, why
I just hate the "every man for himself" mentality in work
I hate the every man for himself in society
Nobody gives a crap about poor people
But my main reson is that life in the citties is just uncomfortable
I litterally needed a car to go to get cash to an atm
Public transport is a nightmare
I liked the people and the food and how vibrant the whole country is but i swear to god i was miserable when i had to take the car for fucking everyrhing
No, because of the Educational (getting loans in order to go to college doesn't seem right) and Healthcare system
Also I wouldn't be comfortable knowing that anyone can have a gun
If I had to move to another country because of unemployment or something like this it'd be an european country, Denmark or Germany most likely
If I became rich or I got an American girlfriend I'd make an exception
No and basically because of the same reasons already stated: impossibly expensive healthcare system, expensive universities that leave you in crippling debt, quite bleak vacations and worker rights
Also the fact that US americans tend to be quite US-centric and there’s a lot of ignorance regarding the rest of the world
Of course you have other wonderful qualities, concepts and life standards that are great but this would be my list of no-nos
Depends on which state and which job I’d have, given that US is probably an amazing place to live if you have a high income
Right now I am a university student and I won't need a loan because university is free
Guns are heavily regulated and the only school shootings I know about are the ones in the international news
When I have children, they will be able to walk to school alone the same way I did and the school won't lack funding or teachers
Once the US might have been the land of hopes and dreams, but for me this is long gone
International news showed me the harsh realities many people live in, like not being able to afford insulin or working three jobs at the same time
This could never happen to me in Austria or Germany
To be (brutally) honest, I don't think I would like living in the US, especially after joining Reddit
I mean, I understand that people tend to be their worst when they're anonymous users online, but I've seen a lot of bigotry, religious intolerance and passive-agressive attitudes from the users of the US in general
I'm not saying all US users are like that, but I think theres a trend
It's also a less safer country than mine and it offers me a lot less advantages when it comes to healthcare or public education
I do love some aspects of the North American culture, like movies, music, books or other parts of your cultural production, but it's not enough to make me want to live there, not in the long term
I could consider staying there for a couple of months to improve my English, but I think Canada, Ireland or any other english speaking country that I can think of would be better for me and can help me improve my language skills just the same
Edit: I'd like to add the xenophobia/racism factor too
People from my extended family has lived there for a while for work (engineering and high salary jobs) and they experienced racism for being Spanish (especially in airports or crossing the border to Mexico) almost in a daily basis
They look European, so I'd say it was more about xenophobia than racism, but it was still fucked up
After reading other comments, I think this one is going to be the uppopular opinion
I would like to live there, probably not my whole life but a few years
I think my opinion is biased because I'm software engineer and in USA you can have great jobs and career progression in that field
&#x200B;
Probably I won't live there because the inmigration policy that as far as I know is extremely difficult to get in but to be fair I know nothing about it
Information would be appreciate haha
if you mean like forever i wouldnt do it
Too many religous people, bad health care, too many fats, too much self centered, i dont like the work culture or the city desings etc etc
I wouldn't feel very comfortable knowing every person I see could have a gun
>people jumped out of their cars trying to get her
This is true
the comunity values for these kinds of stuff are unseen in europe
or like when everything is covered in snow and every neighbour picks a shovel
that's all great
&#x200B;
i was refering more to how self centered everyone is
to the level that nobody will question their friends life decission
And even in the workplace
IDK maybe it's just not the country for me
&#x200B;
And i lived in michigan
I'd been to Portugal many times
Life is nice there, just like in most countries of the EU
Not sure what you expect to prove by saying that
Spain is full of extroverts too :)
Not all states allow that, as far as I know
I'm curious, don't you feel attracted to other European countries  where you could have one too and be probably closer to your relatives
Well, you must have encountered weird Spanish people then XD
Italian people seem to be quite friendly too, in my experience, although maybe it is because Spanish and Italian people tend to have some mild sense on having a kindred spirit
>Since the 2015 ruling of the Supreme Court, all states
Oh, that's great
I'm happy that they finally fixed that
In Spain every mum and dad will tell you every little detail about pregnancy, maternity and solve every doubt you may or may not have
Socially is view as something natural and beautiful so it isn't a taboo
Churros/porras with chocolate
God I'd kill for some right now
^(Edito, a todos los que hablábais de comida antes de que comiese, que os den por c, me he hecho unas croquetas DPM)
unas croquetitas
Macarrones con chorizo too
Döner is the best confort food
Can confirm you do
As a foreigner being invited to a small town near Košice (don't remember the name sorry, well don't remember much to be honest) I was constantly offered slivovice, becherovka, Tatratea
after LUNCH
It was Sunday, just a regular one, and everybody wanted to get the foreigner wasted those little rascals
Please man I haven't eat yet have some mercy
I just ate that today, God they were delicious
Then imagine eating them in the middle of the night, being half drunk hahahahaha
(I can understand you don't like them, have you tried it w/out sugar
Here in my region in Andalucía, churros are not so sweet
We don't add sugar
Un cachopo me estoy haciendo yo :)
Los cachopos están riquísimos, qué bien saben comer en esa zona
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
• Netherlands -> Países Bajos
Literally means "low countries".
• Germany -> Alemania
Being the same because German in Spanish is "Alemán".
• Belarus -> Bielorrusia
• Switzerland -> Suiza
• Latvia -> Letonia
• Sweden -> Suecia
• Iceland -> Islandia
That's curious because it means "Island land".
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
Germany  - Alemania (from the alamani people, probably french influence)
Sweden / Swizterland - Suecia / Suiza (some people get these confused :DD)
Netherlands - Paises Bajos (Low countries)
Latvia - Letonia
Iceland and Greenland: Lose the meaning completelly to just Islandia and Groenlandia, wich dont sound anything like Ice or Green in Spanish
Islandia just sounds like "Island land" if anything
UK: We often just generalize "England" or "English people" when talking about UK as a whole
I think this happens in Italy too
We also call people from USA "Estadounidenses" (Unitedstatians) as "America" reffers to the whole continent here
Beijing - Pekín (not a country but i think its odd)
We used to call the area of southern vietnam [Conchinchina] and we have a saying that if something is very far away its in Conchinchina, but i doubt most people know the real origin of that word as an actual geographical region
Also during the Spanish civil war we called the I-16 aircraft "Mosca" (fly) because of the letters in the crates where its parts came ( Москва́ , Moscow)
I wouldn't say "Hiszpania" is different than Spain/España. It's literally the same etymology
In fact, of all those you mentioned, all of them have the same etymology/direct translation except Germany
Although I concede Węgry does sound really different, but in the end, it's a cognate of "Hungary".
Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe that uses the "deutsch" root like you  (D in German = T in nordic languages)
All Spanish cities have a bar (not related to each other) named "La oficina" (the office), so you can say you're at the office when you're drinking
There’s a hair salon in Luxembourg called ‘Ryan Hair’. Same colour scheme too
In Spain, the word "Arte" un the end, that means art and also is the ending referring "do to you"
Example:
soap store - enjabonarte
Advisory - aconsejarte
Parfum - perfumarte
Food - alimentarte
It was fashion some years ago
Too pretentious for my taste
I know of at least two bars in different cities called "Nottingham Prisa"
In some restaurants (specially in touristic areas) they charge fish and expensive meats (sirloin, etc
) by its weight
It's actually kinda shady tactic that some places do and is easy to fall for it if your a tourist
By law it has to be clearly estated in the menu
It happened to me in Asturias, Northern Spain
If i had to chose one it'd probably be the "Cantar de mío Cid" an epic and the first serious piece of literature in spanish
There are many other poetic works but i'd say this is the one
Probably "Poderoso caballero es don Dinero", by Francisco de Quevedo
Not quite a national poem, but it is the one most people can get behind as it is equal parts saddening and descriptive
I came here to comment on others, but i don't find anyone talking about the Kalevipoeg or Lacplesis and i don't know if i'm wrong and those aren't the national epic of Estonia and Latvia
In spanish literature Cantar de mio Cid
In valencian literature Tirant lo Blanch
Valencian literature is amazing and back in the day it was a huge deal (The Golden Age of Valencia)
>If i had to chose one it'd probably be the "Cantar de mío Cid"
I was about to say the same
I'll be that guy and say that's only for traditionally Castilian Spain (not the story, the poem and it's style)
Why not Cantar de mio Cid
I would rather say the Sigismund monologue in "La vida es sueño" by Calderón de la Barca
Me too, found a translation to spanish and i keep it like a treasure :D
i support this one more but probably becouse im from castille
Too honourable, not bleak enough
The last monologue of Sigismund is probably the most brilliant piece of drama ever written in Spanish
it was translated to spanish some years ago and got me a copy, i really like it :D
I had studied it and im not even german
Where i live we have an army of cats and many boars
let me tell you, being pursuit by a boar IS not fun
On a lighter note we also have rabbits and dears though they keep out of the resiential areas
We also see a couple of foxes every year and a few squirrels
There are lots of Birds of course and amongst them the iberian magpie ...which thrives in our town and almost nowhere else on Earth
that's what happens when you live by the campo (it's not the BEST translation, but lets go with  forest)
Only cats, birds and lizards
AND FUCKING HUGE ASIAN WASP THEY'VE COME TO KILL US ALL THE TOWN IS FULL OF THEM THIS YEAR WHAT THE FUCK
And don't forget they make holes through metalic fences so they're really hard to control
My aunt once hit a monstruous boar with the car, the boar just shruded off the hit and run away, but It left a pretty dent on the car
As someone who lives in Qatar, I won’t say too much on this because
you know
freedom of speech isn’t a right here
But yeah I agree with most people in this comment section
I hope there's a Corona outbreak exclusively confined to Qatar the month before the World Cup
Yeah it’s okay
I actually moved here with my parents when I was 8
They moved here due to financial incentives (high salaries, no income taxes)
However I am graduating high school this year and will move back to Europe
It's because they are boring and bland
I almost cried of laghter when a dutch friend told me the national dish was fucking smashed potatoes with vegetables in it and a bit of salt
I just always seems that norhtern cuisines are too simple and boring and without any spice
There are of course exceptions and a roasted whatever is always nice but there is no variation
Because Spain and Italy are kings when it comes to flavour
OP said southern european, not souther asian
Spanish food is basically the opposite
See, when i think about northern europe i was refering more to central europe (poland germany, netherlands, etc)
Ofc i hadn't thought about food growth in finland
And I still think about it as bland
Very little variation
No coulour, few spice
Idk maybe i'm just spoiled since spanish food is so varied
That's cool
But sauce it up a little bit
A finnish friend made me try it and sold it as like the best thing since fire hahahaha
It wasn't that bad, honestly
Not even close
Those are mashed potstoes
Spanish omelette is made bu frying the potatoes and onions and then mixing them with eggs and then cook it a little bit to shape it
It's rich and sweet and salty
Simple yet good
I think that's it
We've historically had access to a lot of things the Northern Europeans simply didn't. Specially in Spain where Arabs brought a lot of then exotic stuff like rice or saffron (hence paella among other things)
Or in the Balkans where they hd a lot of contact with Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine because of trade and later the Ottoman period
Also I'd say our food has way more carb (cereals, rice
) than Northern Europe's.
Yeah i like the stpry
And it makes sense with the potatoes and all that
Well i fuess it's a matter of opinion but a tortilla should not be bland
Only bland tortillas are bland
Try putting more salt
The first one is tortilla
The socind one is herecy (spanish inquisition intensiefies)
"Sacro Imperio Romano Germanico"
Usually call "El sacro Imperio"
(Sacred(Holy)-empire-roman-germanic)
(The Sacred (Holy) Empire)
In Spanish is the same as in Turkish when you translate it to English:
- *Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico* (Holy Roman Germanic Empire)
Sacto Imperio romano germánico
Here you have it
Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico
It sounds really cool
maybe as the romans had a lot of liks with the zone they consider that it was more relevant part of the name than the others
Would you say it's "usually" called *El Sacro Imperio*? I would say the most common way is *El Sacro Imperio Romano*, only omitting the *Germánico* part
Another note is that while *sacro* does mean "holy", the typical way to say "holy" in Spanish is *sagrado*.
I would say "el Sacro Imperio Romano" is more popular
na its better this way
now the people know that in Spain and in Portugal we call the HRE the same way
Sacro and Sagrado are the same in spanish, different addaptations of latin
Sacro is usually in "cult" contexts, while sagrado was the evolution of the latin word
Santo (Holy) is however different
And being Spanish catholic as fuck, we also have Sacrosanto, which is like Holy Sacred
Feels like an RPG item prefix, but essentially means that something is holy and sacred
For the first part i had see more the "El sacro imperio" than "El sacro imperio romano" but it will probably depend on the zone, and "sacro" is a quite hard word to define but i had search it in the RAE and is just a nother form of the adjective and its the same as "sagrado" so i will edit the post
too long to be used comonly in my opinion
TIL, never heard it english
The Real Academia Española is also trying to do it and failing
They can't add any fad word that is going to be forgotten next year
AFAIK the RAE only adapts their spelling to the spanish spelling norms - with hilarious results
They say that if there's an alternative in Spanish, you should use that
If there isn't, then you should used the adapted spelling
> They say that if there's an alternative in Spanish, you should use that
As it should be
Replacing words with no reason makes one looks stupid
It's natural that some foreign words replace "native" ones
Specially since speaking a second language is so widespread
It's happened before with words from other languages
In the 19th century it happened with French because that was the influential language at the time
Now it happens with English
I'm of the opinion that rules should adapt to speakers, not the other way around
sensitive/sensible
In Spanish "sensitive" means "sensible" and "sensible" traslates as "sensato".
You can't imagine the faces I get with clients every time a tell them their dogs tummy feels sensible
I teach English in Spain and they always jet ‘chicken’ and ‘kitchen’ mixed up
It’s so cute when they say they had a kitchen sandwich for lunch
When spanish people starts learning Spanish we tend to believe after means before and before means after
It's probably because before in spanish is antes, which looks pretty much like after
"In" and "on" I mix them a lot
Also translating subjuntive from Spanish to English
I always have a horrible time with prepositions in English
To be based on / off of
Take something *from* somewhere / *off of* somewhere
I was tought you can't have two prepositions together and then to hear /off of/ everywhere
The same for me
It's the same word in Spanish also, aislar
It was for me
In the same vein, assist/attend screw with me hard
For those who don't know, *to attend* = *asistir*.
To pull an Uno reverse card, I mindlessly said "atender a las clases" because of English influence
A lot of constipated students, then
Poland is very catholic so makes kinda sense
In Spain, and I think in the rest of the world as well, is the favorite pope of everyone
In Spain probabily Andrés Iniesta or Rafa Nadal
Antonio Banderas
Especially here in Málaga where I live, his hometown
Same in Spain
They are uncommon in Spain
Maybe the climate change deniers are more common than others, but still a minority
Not in Spain, AFAIK
There's propaganda and extreme beliefs, like in any other country –for example, people claiming that we lived better under Franco's dictatorship
But I haven't really felt any anti-science movement
Climate change deniers, for sure
Homeopathy must be a thing as I've seen several signs advertising "homeopathic doctors". Antivaxx are also a thing
Don't know about flat earthers but I'm sure there are a few as we have all of the others
No antivaxx at all
No flat-Earth believers at all
There are some climate change deniers though
We have a few CC deniers
For instance, [Federico Jiménez Losantos] a right-wing radio personality with a decent amount of followers, denies anthropogenic climate change
Not really, at least not with any noticeable presence
People who defend those arguments are just idolatrous of America who try to follow every trend thoughtlessly
Denying climate change would be to looking at a graph and say "That line is really not going up, is an optical illusion"
I had never heard about that, just searched it & wow
While it's true that we are still far from anti-science propaganda (like anti-vax people, flat earthers or homeopathy), there are some politicians that either ignore of flat out deny the problem of climate change
I'm not gonna throw names, but only a few parties are advocating for green policies, & a lot are not paying any attention to the issue
Anyways, this is something we'll see in these next elections
The war happened 80 years ago, 95% of the european population we have today was not even alive, and most of the people who was actually alive by then weren't even aware of what was happening because they were too young
So most europeans are over it already
At least in Western Europe I'd say we get along pretty well nowadays
The thing that has most effect on foreign relations nowadays is Brexit, and I wouldn't say it changes too much our perception of either Europe nor UK
As a spaniard, I think that neither of them have any effect on our country's foreign relations currently
However our own Civil War has still an effect in our country's interiors affairs and in everything that happens nowadays
Is there hate towards germans and/or russians nowadays there in Poland
Most of the people who fought that war is dead already or they were too young to remember
Little bit more complicated than that
Franco's regime influence can be noticed countrywide for sure, culturally and politically
Of course in Cataluña and País Vasco is noticed in a different way than in Madrid, Castilla or Andalucía (national pride vs reaction against nation)
What I mean about the Civil War influence is the division between republicans and nationalist people, still very strong
Actually the only time we spanish people agree the country has been united in the last decades  was in the recent period of success in football, winning two Euros and the World Cup in four years
Everybody supporting Spain in the streets and enjoying
The magic of sports
I really get confused in /r/relationship_advice and some others like these
It's like things there are so different that I can't relate at all
Like dating multiple people to see which one you want to be with, or moving in with someone after a month (or six), or 19 years old married and having kids
Such negativity against age difference in relationships too, it seems everyone there has to be with someone that is just their age or 2 more 2 less, and if not is bad/weird
I come from a culture where people start having kids in their early to mid 30, and most people don't move out of their parents home until then (or if they can get a job, since Spain has a huge problem with people getting jobs), and moving in with someone here is like a super huge step, and it's just not done in one month, or 6
If some friend did that I would be worried
Also age difference is not like super important
It only gets weird if you are with someone 20 years older, and in some case (my sisters) it's not even that big deal
People just accept it and move on
Also here being married at 19 is considered like teen marriage or something because you are not really considered an adult, even if you legally are
But these years, your late teens/ twenties are supposed to be about partying, going to college and trying things, traveling
Like, when my troublesome cousin got a woman pregnant at 18 at my family was really hush hush about it because some of them (specially my grandma) were ashamed
But the majority would feel very sorry for someone having kids in their late teens/early twenties because it is seen as losing your youth with kids
My cousin was really sorry about it, that's for sure
And if you are with someone, even a potential someone, you are not seeing other people
They would be mad
I would be mad
It would be seen as playing with someone
And the dating culture here doesn't exist as such
We don't go on dates, or date people like they do
We just hang with people and it just happens
Or Tinder I guess
But you don't do that programming on a date with the specifics of it being romantic
You just ask to hang on with someone to do stuff
I am not saying what things are better here, only that they are so so so different that their relationship advice is not relatable to me at all
Also I read /r/talesfromyourserver and these, and things here are really different too, since here no one tips, and it's not like waiters earn a lot of money
They also don't talk to people or do nothing except serve your food
If you want you leave some leftover coins, but that is all
Also you don't tip you hairdresser either, or the taxi driver (TAXIS HERE ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE
) or anyone i guess
There is no tipping culture, so when I read about it it's strange, but it also shows me that things are different in different part of the world
Specially USA since is so USA-centric
And there's so much drama
I feel the same that you
But to be honest, I have never believed that internet is a good place to ask personal advice
It's a double edged sword
It gives us access to people with a wide variety of experiences, but also to a lot of noise, lies and people whose authenticity can't be confirmed
It's the same with any kind of information
I this case you don't have even the variety element, since there is a dominant cultural filter
For personal advice, I prefer people I can trust, either friends, partners or professionals, depending on the case
On the other hand, I like to follow some of those subreddits out of anthropological curiosity
They are a great window to certain American cultural manierisms
I actually don't, but I do feel frustration sometimes, like when people go ballistic in the downvoting of a simple mistake or when some proven and documented facts of History are overlooked to fit silly agendas
I come here for the fun and the laughs and I am in the geek side of the spectrum, so this place is like a little paradise to me
Lots of subs to investigate, some subs to carefully avoid
Do you
What would change that
It may be so, but if you got to these subs all the posts are made by really young people, and a lot are married and with kids
Not saying is a general thing there, just in that sub
I am not trying to offend anyone
I just wonder how they do it
I mean, here when people start seeing each other are in that honeymoon stage and messaging each other all day **rolls eyes**, and if there were more than one person you could literally spend all day messaging people
Or maybe people here are just too needy and want all the attention
LMAO
Seeing it in Reddit is pretty normal
Just look at those subs and you will see
Let me add r/touchthafishy , please
Curiosity is a legitimate reason
I actually think I become a bit more passive aggressive and annoying
In the mood of "I don't give a fuck about anything" when I think in reality I'm really a shy guy who can get easily nervous
Idk if it counts as changing personality, but I find it harder to express anger and frustration in English than in Spanish, mostly because cursing in English feels so weak
I can't swear comfortably in english so its harder for me to get angry
I am way more polite in english than spanish
I feel it's easier to curse and I think I have less inhibitions when I change languages
Igen
Spanish government has created a ton of jobs as beach security
Basically people that remind you to wear a mask and keep the beach civil
They make about 2000€/month
Not to say that it isn't hard work
It's just good salary
Same here in Spain, and I guess everywhere as it not a pleasant job
I had a familiar that worked as a garbage truck driver here in Spain and he got 500
000 pts every month (about 3
000 €, and it was after taxes) when the national average were 100
000 pts (about 600 € after taxes), that was about 30 years ago
He worked all night and he switched for a "normal" job in order to not have to sleep all day and work at night
Nowadays the difference between the average national salary and the garbage truck driver is not as big as it was before
I think standing in 40 degree sun for 8 hours straight wouldn't be so enjoyable
I was at the beach yesterday
They just wander along the beach and let people know when they are too close
No parasol, just a hat
I didn't see a clipboard
Madrid - busy, tons of pedestrians and parkways, art and museums, nightlife, great metro system
Barcelona - built up, lavish hotels and shopping, distinct neighborhoods, also great metro plus trams
Málaga - tourists, beach resorts, major airport and seaport which means cruise ships
Sevilla - flamenco, foods most associated with Spain, gothic cathedral, only one metro line but there's also a streetcar
Granada - Alhambra, arabic architecture and art, hills, cobblestone bridges, narrow streets, impossible to drive downtown, you're going to walk a lot
I might add more later
You made me laugh
I have been in Ostrava as erasmus but spent several weekends in Kraków, Katowice and Wroclaw
Very good memories, a lot of "hooligans" as you say but no problem as long as you drink enough to get respect
Oviedo: partying with cyder
>Galway: \[...\] Spaniards
Could you explain this one
Hey, leave Palma out of this
Maybe former Yugoslavian countries
That's all
No further expansion unless Norway or Iceland change their mind
the later 30 years were mainly economic integration, comon laws
the next 30 years I expect to see deeper integration on military and diplomatic fields
The last steps to secure a no-war Europe
The brexiteers won't see that and this will be part of the reason why the UK will rejoin
The UK: We are going to leave and become a third country
The EU: *Treats the UK as a third country*
The UK: *Pikachu face* You are a bully
I think the key in a federation is that "we're one but we're not the same"
We don't need to be the same to be in the same country
I think we need a common foreign policy in order to be considered a confederation
Once that's a thing the EU would pretty much look like a single country from outside its borders, not matter how decentralized it's internally
You can ask the same question about Spain: why do we speak a Romance language instead of a Visigothic one
The explanation is the same exact one that was given in this post about France: the ruling class were a minority of invaders, but the majority of the population spoke Vulgar Latin
Same thing if you extend it to the 700-year Muslim period: they were the ruling class and, although there was a certain degree of mixture, the common people were of native Roman/Iberian origin, culture and language
I think if you think about spain you could find the answer to your question
Why do spaniards speak spanish and not arabic
Interestingly enough, in England the opposite happened: the Celtic and Latin speaking subjects ended up adopting the Germanic languages of their Angle, Saxon and Jute rulers
Similarly, in Muslim Iberia people at first spoke a Romance language inffluenced by Arab but in time they ended up adopting the Arab of their rulers
I guess that in this last case it was easy because people would learn Arab in their communities' mosques and there was a period of bilingualism
Portugal did have colonies well into the 20th century
Spain had a few with much lesser importance both economically and culturally
I'm definitely interested in what difference there are in Portuguese opinions about Angola and Mozambique depending on age
- Basque country (Basque names are easy to identify, even if someone can name his child a Basque name without being from there):
- First names: Iñaki, Mikel, Ander, Julen Aitor, Andoni, Antxon, Gorka, Iker
/Ainhoa, Amaia, Irati, Izaskun
- Last names: Goikoetxea, Etxeberria, Iraizoz, Odriozola
- Galicia:
- First names: Iago, Brais, Xoel
/Uxia, Naia, Diana, Icía...
- Last names: I can't think of a lot of Galician surnames
Bouxo, Loureiro, Bergantiños
- Catalonia/Balearic Islands/Valencia (I can't differentiate between these three regions, maybe someone from there can enlighten more):
- First names: Joan, Jordi, Oriol, Josep, Xavi, Carles, Sergi, Eric, Marc, Pol, Pau
/Carme, Dolors, Joana
- Last names: Puig, Ferrer, Serra, Bosch, Forcadell
Those are relatively easy, but I have no idea about the rest of Spain
There are some first names I can link to Canary Islands like Aday, Yeray or Yurena but they are pretty extended
Also, in Murcia and South Alicante there are some very common surnames with Catalan origins, like Verdú, Puigcerver or Cánovas, that I usually link to this zone
About the rest of Spanish names and surnames, I don't think I would be able to link them to any particular zone
Specially from the basque country are the easier but not all
here you have a list
There's hundreds of surnames in my country that straight up reveal where one is from
I would say the most blunt factor is language
If you have a Spanish surname you could be from anywhere in Spain, but if your surname is in Galician, Catalan or Basque, the options narrow
For instance Smith in Spanish would be Herrero, in Catalan it is Ferrer, in Galician it is Ferreiro
(I don't know about Basque, as it is not a Latin language and it is very different from the rest)
Once you've discarded the minoritarian languages and obviously the toponims (that is, the surnames that are just the name of a city or a mountain, in which case it is pretty obvious), and therefore their respective regions, you are probably left with a bunch of Pérez, Martínez, García, López and Hernández
You have absolutely no way to know where these people come from
There's many other surnames that you can guess, for instance, those that sound Arab are most likely from the south of Spain, where the Moors lived for longer than in the rest of the peninsula, between the 8th and the 15th century
Arab surnames sometimes start with Al-, like Alcántara, Almonacid, Almeida, Alcaide
But if you're not a Spaniard, I believe this is the furthest you can dive into the surnames thing
As for Spaniards, they'll most likely recognise regional surnames
My first name is of Catalan-descent, but it ONLY exists in my 3,000 inhabitants village in the Valencian Community
People in the neighbouring villages have their "autochthonous" surnames too, so if someone at my university has a surname such as Aparici, Magraner or Girbés, I'll immediately suspect they might be from my village's region
My second surname is very obviously Catalan too, so people know for certain I'm from the East of Spain, more specifically from València; it is also from Jewish ancestry and my mother's village used to be a Jewish village many centuries ago, so there's a lot of us with the same surname in the same region
Yeah
Here's very easy to tell if someone is from the Basque Country or a Catalan speaking region from their last name alone
While the same is true about Galicia, I'd say Spanish last names are very extended so it's harder to find purely Galician ones
People having Spanish first names but last names in the local language is also really common
It depends on the region and the parent's preference
For example, Julia Etxebarria Gómez (Spa+Bas+Spa) or Jordi Sánchez Pujol are names you can totally see (Cat+Spa+Cat)
Also Basque first names are somewhat popular outside the Basque Country even if you're not Basque
I guess because they sound cool and unique
As of other regions, I'd agree only the Canary Island have some weird names that you would never hear in other places
But last names are always Spanish
I don't know if there's even local last names
The rest of Spain is pretty uniform, I'd say
I'd like to add the typical last names from the province of Álava, normally composed of a patronymic and a place: López de Mendoza, López de Ayala, Díaz de Mendívil, Ortiz de Zárate, Ruiz de Aguirre
Just a thing, Naia is quite common in Catalonia nowadays and I think it's origin can be Greek or Basque where it is extremely common
Nowadays it is getting more difficult to supose someone's place of birth by its name
Agreed
Names and surnames of Basque, Galician and Catalan origin are easy to spot, but the rest not so much (at least for me
If you take the Spanish surnames and change the "J" (it doesn't exist) for an "X" chances are you end up with a Galician name
Another useful trick is changing "H" for "F".
> Catalonia/Balearic Islands/Valencia
Those are more Catalan than anything
In Mallorca for characteristic names you'll find suff like Tomeu, Xisco, Toni or Tomeu /Catalina, Margalida
There are many particular surnames: Quetglas, Rotger, Rullán, Llabrés, Amengual, Adrover, Salom
That I haven't seen outside
Then there's the noble surnames: Dameto, Zaforteza, Cotoner, Oleza, Ferrer de Sant Jordi
And the "jewish surnames": Aguiló, Bonnín, Cortès, Forteza, Fuster, Martí, Miró, Picó, Piña, Pomar, Segura, Tarongí, Valentí, Valleriola, Valls
(Many have non-jewish variants outside tho)
And in Ibiza everyone is called Torres, Costa, Marí, Tur or Escandell
Wow there are Tatars in Lithuania
There are still plenty of José Maria's being born
Naia is also greek, hence my comment
But it exists in other languages such as Hawaiian or Arabic
So hardly Basque only
It's in Greek too but with a different meaning, though
Haven’t lived in South Africa for 23 years
Been in Spain for three years now and hoping to never leave - it’s such a great country
I have left France in 2014, then lived in London, UK for a few years and really enjoyed it
Left London in 2018 and now I live in Barcelona, Spain, and I really like it
Spain worked out well for us, got jobs quickly and easily
Now my partner and I both work for remote companies so we feel privileged
We both spoke Spanish beforehand, the people are nice, the lifestyle is great, and the country is dope
Catalunya has a nice coastline (I like diving) and beautiful hills and mountains further inland
I do like Catalan culture, language and identity
I'm from not too far across the border and I feel pretty close to the local culture
The only pain point is the nonsensical bureaucracy
Getting the paperwork in order is a pain in the ass, especially compared to the UK
Not planning to go back to France any time soon
I might move there in the far future but that's not planned at the moment
It's nearby and I can visit often
Kenyan moved to Spain 4 almost 5 years ago, I go back at least once every two years to visit family
I do plan on going back but not to live
My story is a bit weird, i was born in Andorra, moved to Italy when i was 2 years old and then moved again from Italy to the USA when i was 13 years old, i currently live in Andorra and i love It here, i dont want to move out and i definetely dont want to live in Italy or the US again
Molta força! You can always come back home :)
Catalonia (or Spain) is a great place to live as long as you have a good job, it has everything you need to be happy: good weather, good food and friendly people
I lived 2 years in England and I made very good friends there but I had everything at home, I "had" to come back
Indeed
Malaga is just like Cape Town in that regard
Wine is arguably better in Spain, though
Left SA middle of ‘97
Moved to Bahrain
Lived there for around a year and a half, then lived in Qatar for 6 months for a project
Back to Bahrain for around 6 months and then to the U.K. Lived there for 17 years
Post Brexit we sold the house, I shut my business and moved here
The long way - we lived in the U.K. (got an offer and a work permit) for long enough to get a British passport and moved as EU citizens
Absolutely
We really wanted to live in the EU
Brexit broke our hearts because we had a great life there
Left a lot of friends behind but some visit
I’m working freelance now, but not in Spain - I work at the EC in Brussels
Children
We wanted them to have the opportunity to live and work in the EU
Growing up in SA meant 90% of travel required a visa prior to travelling
But Norwegians still enjoy FoM, no
The most important part for us
> Ah ok
Anyone can apply for a job in the EU though, whether you are a citizen of the EU, or the US, or India
But its obviously a bit easier living in the EU
A lot easier
Work permits are expensive
> Yes
My South African husband tried for a few years talking me into moving to the UK (way before Brexit was a thing)
He never succeeded, so we are still in Norway
Wise choice (in both husband and staying) :)
Bakamonoga, doitsu no kagaku wa sekai ichi
Neuken in de keuken
Not me but I have to mention it, a guy I met told me one of the few sentences he knew in Spanish was "Saca tus manos de mi pene, por favor".
My ex girlfriend’s brother taught me *Ich pinkle im stehen* and told me to say it to a group of my girlfriends friends
Anata wa suteki desu
It would be "*no tengo dinero*", but what were they teaching you in Spanish class
You have to add a little: “soy una puta muy* estúpida” is the literal translation :)
ColaCao - Powdered cocoa drink
And of course the food
when you spend a few weeks abroad and see some food from Spain its like you're back home, specially if its well done
Those look rather cool
It sounds to me like the lake scene of "Call me by your name"
A kiwi that knows Spain better than locals
[I like this video about Galicia]
This vlogger has a bunch of videos in general about Spain
This Guy IS amazing
Me too
Es el sindrome de españita, todos hablamos mal de ella pero todos la echamos de menos
I can't even remember the name
"Do it for your lover" perhaps
TLTR: Manel Navarro's do it for your lover
Never Chiki Chiki
A foolish Spanish man would say Chiki Chiki:
Chiki Chiki was a joke, it's a Spanish comedian that was sent thanks to a massive voting
That means Spain made a little light-hearted joke, we all laughed about it, and it was funny
The lyrics are stupid but at least they reference some situation from Spain like "Juan Carlos le dice ¿por qué no te callas
"It's basically a bunch of Spanish memes from the time
It was always good to be laughed at, but it was the intention
At least it showed we know how to make fun of ourselves and we have a sense of humour
Manel Navarro's "Do it for your lover" is however, the worst by far in my opinion
- I couldn't care less about Eurovision, but there are some people that do
Well, guess what, Spanish TV said their votes didn't matter (people voted for a different singer to go) and sent Manel Navarro and his awful song anyway
- Eurovision could be a way to show your culture and promote your country
Well, the song had nothing to do with Spain, it's not a Spanish genre and it's not about Spain
- At least you can have some good singers and nice visuals
No way, the dance was dull, the atmosphere was bland and the singing was terrible to the point it left a horrible voice crack (the only thing worth saving)
It's only good to be laughed at
but it wasn't the intention
"Do it for your lover". We wanted to get 0 points because the guy was awful but Portugal had to give us some
Hmm
All but the Chiqui Chiqui, that shit hit hard
Special mention to that guy who had a voice crack
Not the worse, but the most ridiculous
I honestly think that in 2003 your country got zero points due to the Iraq war
Eurovision is heavily impacted by politics
When I went to work to Poland my boss showed me that song, it was so funny and I felt some much second-hand embarrassment at the same time
Doohtjhooo it for your loooover
Damn you Portugal, why did you give us 5 points
We were so close to 0
> that was sent thanks to a massive voting
Our very own Chiki McChikiface
The best part is that Chiki Chiki won the vote in Spain to go to Eurovision thanks to a campaign by an online forum similar to 4Chan
It was then that Spain decided to change the way the voting system worked
I couldn't say which was worse, Manel or "[Que me quiten lo bailao] from 2011
Both are a joke, poor Manel was the punchline to a bunch of shitty songs, with the final off-key climax
We don't want to win Eurovision, it's clear that what we like is Eurodrama
Eurovision 2019, that couple that seemed to want to kill themselves
What was that
Do it for your lovaaaaaaaaa
Manel Navarro was the worst
With all my love I agree
not only that, he also was chosen by RTVE even when the audience chose another singer
Yeah
I don't feel proud of chikilicuatre, at all
Spanish broadcasting did something similar, they got pissed and organised a jury that bypassed the people's choice
It's pretty sad, it's just a silly circus, let the people have their fun at least
The problem is that Spanish national television doesn't take participation in Eurovision seriously and those of us who like the show are fed up with it
They don't realise that it is part of our image as a country and they send any kind of bullshit without investing seriously or considering the candidatures with professionalism
Chiki Chiki was a joke that started in a late night that ended up as something that can be interpreted as an act of protest: if RTVE is not going to take the festival seriously, we will vote to send the most absurd entry we can
I wish we had something like Melodifestivalen or Sanremo
I personally feel much more proud of Chiki Chiki than of the next twelve that have come after it
PD: To no one's surprise, this year we're sending another piece of shit
I SHIT shits more interesting than the two songs that have been proposed for this year
In fact, the melody is almost a satire of Daddy Yankee's Gasolina
They even had to change it a little bit because it was identical I think
Even worse,  Chiki Chiki was bad on purpose
Ok, I had the memory of being quite ok but now I have heard and
yeah, it wasn't politics
Iberian bros
Guys, WE WANTED A ZERO
We love you but we wanted zero
If you cannot win lose big
Agree to disagree
Pointless, apparently
Nope, officially Spain didn't fight in any of the two world wars
I think it's mainly a British thing though
No, the soviet invasion of finland
Which Finland lost, but the soviets lost a lot of soldiers
The Spaniard comes here too
That isn't unique to Germany though
Here I would say that Galicia is closer to northern Portugal than to Andalusia, for example
I wish we did use the short version *Chequia* because it's more practical tham verbose *República Checa*. But for some reason the younger generation has been taught to call it the former so now using *Chequia* sounds a bit weird
Yes
1its shorter
2 it helps us to save time
Like in Spanish: “Chechenia”
A lot of countries do it this way
For instance not everyone in Malaysia is Malay or not everyone in Laos is Lao
I guess the country just ends up being named after the largest or more influential geographical area or people group and that's the logic to it
Not too crazy :)
Aesthetically any of these two:
[The II Republic of Spain] flag has to be one of the best in Spanish History
IT'S GOT PURPLE FFS
I think the best is La Cruz de Brogoña (I don't know how to put the link, sorry)
Burgundy cross
That flag is so strong and beautiful
I liked more my flag when it had some purple
"My country"
I would go with the flag of the kingdom of Galicia since the middle ages
Might be too religious with the chalice and one cross for each province, but I like it
Castilla y León [flag]
[Asturias flag and the Castille & Leon flag] would look really unique compared to modern flags
I'm obviously talking about the visual taste, not the ideological one: the one used during the fascist regime of Franco and the Aspes de Borgoña (the flag of the Spanish empire and the conservative "carlista" movement)
I'm in love with the Cantabria labarum but it's historicity is disputed at best:
I think the best "Cruz de Borgoña" is the one with the [two headed eagle]
And the crown is substituted by a castle
If Spain becomes a republic some day the only thing I would want to keep the same would be the flag colours, I just don't like the purple addition
If i'm not wrong we have "celos" for jealousy and "envidia" for envy
"Envidia" is envy, and "celos" is jealousy
I think they almost have the same meaning, although one is more appropriate to use in different contexts than the other
This happens to a lot of Spanish words
Well
That's a tough question
So there's **roughly** 7 languages in the country I would personally consider: Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque, aranes, aragones, asturleones and Arabic
Spanish has **roughly** 14 dialects in the country (pretty few for our size and geography) [here is a map]
Catalan has **roughly** 8 dialects in the country
[here is a map]
Galician has **very roughly** three dialectal groups, with who knows how many dialects
**Roughly** 42
[source]
Basque has **officially** 5 dialects,  Though historically almost each town had its own dialect
[here is a map]
Aranes **I think** has only 1 dialect in Spain
Though it may have in France, if occitan is somehow still alive after french normalisation
Aragones has 4 **dialectal groups
** and **roughly
** 12 **dialects
** [here is the wiki]
Asturleones has 3 **dialectal groups** and **roughly** 12 dialects
[here is a map]
Arabic has 1 dialect in Spain, in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla
So all in all
8 languages and 40-98 *dialects*.
Edit: However the level of intelegibility varies a lot
The Basque dialects are almost languages of their own
Spanish in comparisson is **very** tame with its dialects
That's probably because there was a great effort done by the crown to estandardize Spanish
and also impose it in non native territory
That has ironically prevented other languages from doing the same
I think that's why the likes of Basque or asturleones have such astonishing variety for their respective sizes
Spanish
Only in Spain, one per valley
Spain has three official languages, apart from Spanish: Catalan, Basque and Galician
Then you have Valencian (some say it's a language, some say it's a dialect from Catalan), Asturianu which is a dialect from Latin (not from Spanish) I think
Then we have Aragonese, Extremeño, Andaluz and Murcian (I think all of them are considered dialects) and there are a lot of different dialects that I'm probably forgetting
I think it may be due to historic reasons
After Rome, Spain was very dislocated into different kingdoms and small counties, and a lot of centuries had to pass until there was a real union between those different territories
That may have led to those differences but I'm not certain
well yes
having take almost a whole continent gives you a lot of variety
There are more languages, like the Caló or Fala
They just don't have the same protection because of political and historical reasons
Here Gaelic refers to Scottish Gaelic, not Irish
How is it even possible with such a huge extension of land
Well, Franco's dictatorship tried it here  with regional languages and it didn't work
So it's still impressive in a weird way
Wow, that really shows their character, huh
Lol, Spanish has many dialects and Spain has many languages, everyone wants to kill others just for that
We have more than 10 dialects only in Spain and I'm not even talking about Catalan or other regional languages, it's impressive what they have achieved
Edited
Dublin (Ireland) usually attracts a lot of IT workers
I would also say that
it also has an increadible amount of connections, a large population very nearby, a strategic location, KLM HQ and Delta hub
Apart from that it's in the same country as the largest port in Europe (and second
In the world)
In other words, if you travel by plane a bit you're bound to end up in schiphol
I went there 3 times before visiting Amsterdam
It's usually called Pfizer vaccine, and sometimes you'll see the full name of Pfizer-BioNTech
Only 8 (spanish, portuguese, catalan, french, italian, english, russian, german)
Oh i forgot that merci was exported, so romanian and hungarian aswell
Edit: apparently hungarians don't use merci
spanish, galician, portuguese, french, italian, english, german, slovak, ukrainian, russian
Romanian, Spanish, Catalonian, Asturian (although it’s not considered an official language, so idk if it counts), English, French, German
Gracias, Obrigado, Thank you, Merci, Tak, Aitäh, Eskerrik asko, Grazie, Spasiba, Danke,  Dziękuję Ci, Ačiū
Edit: Had to check the spelling of the last two
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Catalan, German, English, French, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic
Spanish, Galician, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish
Not many, now that I count them
Spanish, English, Swedish, German, Portuguese, French, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian (Danish
Idk these three languages are dialects hehe), Russian
Spanish, Galician, Portuguese, French, English, Italian, German, Russian and Danish
West to east:
Obrigado
Gracias
Thank you
Merci
Gracie
Danke
Dzenkuije (I can say it but not write it)
Spanish, Basque, English, French, Portuguese, Italian, German and Polish
Oh my bad, when i went there i used it
I did as the guide said .
Not much
In Castillan it’s “gracias” and in Asturian it’s “gracies”
...non, now it's just a Matter of time
So, IS merci hungarian
>Merci can be a nickname for someone called Mercédesz
Hey here it's Merche, nickname for Mercedes
Thanks for your wisdom, dear Magyar
There's this Spanish fashion brand called "Desigual" that decided that to release [this campaign] for Spring and Mother's Day
Basically, a model dancing around while dressing up to go out, trying a fake pregnant belly and then poking condoms
The slogan
"You decide", way too similar to pro-choice abortion slogans
Everyone hated that ad lol
Anti-feminists claim that this was today's left way of thinking: putting women's desires over men's rights and whatnot
Feminists, the ones that the ad supposedly aimed at, said that it gave a frivolous image of women as man-eaters and completely missed the point of feminism
Fake wokeness at its finest
Obviously, they ended up pulling the ad
Rich chinese people
Ships, docks a ton of sea transport and commerce
Micro state that all it's city, extremely expensive, adored by some for how good they do or have implemented something that gets a headline, but at the same time super strict country like banning gum or porn
At first glance it looks like a nice country but you look closer and it isn't.
money swamp
Those 3 buildngs that share a roof, the floating stadium and chewing gum ban
Small rich country south of Malaysia, had a minor role at the beginning of WW2 when it was occupied by the Japanese (from the British)
And that's pretty much all I know
Money and gum
My 2 friends from there
Also the fact that they were both gay and never would tell each other since it is not well accepted in their society
In Spain, a common female first name is "Dolores", which literally means "Pain". There is a famous song about a naughty girl named Dolores that doesnt want to be called Pain but Lola (which is a short for Dolores, but also Lolita), and claims she is the one that goes always alone in the night of Barcelona looking for fun
Here is the song:
"Auxilio" and "Socorro" (both of them mean literally "Help" and are the words you are supposed to shout when you are in serious trouble) are also female first names in Spain
My village is one of the last that celebrate a festivity called "os maios", held during May
It welcomes the spring and celebrates mother earth
It's a pre-roman festivity that was almost untouched by Christianity
People dance and sing traditional songs, called "coplas" around fake trees that are built with plants, flowers, eggs shells and fruits peels (like oranges or lemons) ([this is a traditional one] )
There are other cities on the north that celebrate this as well, but as far as I know is a festival that is dying
Everybody knows about the "Armada Invencible", how the king of Spain tried to conquer England and failed but there's much more to this story
It's portrayed as a huge fleet attacking an innocent country with fewer numbers
Actually Queen Elizabeth had been attacking the Spanish ships that came from the Americas for years and she had filled her pockets with the Spanish gold
That's how Drake got knighted, by the way
The Spanish army then sailed to England in 1588, it was a large fleet but by no means it was the largest who had ever tried to conquer England (which is often said) like the French fleet in 1544
England initially had less ships but the Queen recruited private ships surpassing the Spanish fleet in number
The weather scattered the ships and an accident decimated even more the Spanish fleet decreasing their power
In the end, as is already known, the English fleet won against the Spanish
What isn't told, though, is that just a year later, in 1589, the English with Francis Drake on the head did the opposite and tried to destroy the remaining Spanish fleet but instead it was a complete disaster and got their ass kicked
1/5 of the English men died, around 20k soldiers, doubling the losses that suffered the Spanish with the "Invincible Armada". This is known as the [English Armada]
**Cartagena, on the east coast of Spain, attempted to become a U.S. state, and the north americans missed the opportunity to have their own Gibraltar
How
In 1873, during the First Republic, the cantonal revolt took place in Spain
A canton would be an independent territory, and the cantonal movement could be considered federalist
The curious thing about this movement is not the idea of wanting a federated Spain, but the type of territories that wanted to become independent
We have better known cantons or independence movements such as Cartagena, Sevilla, Granada, Valencia, but there were also much smaller independence movements all over the country
For example, the town of Motril, which at that time had only 10-12k inhabitants, declared independence, although it only existed from July 22 to 25, 1873
F for Motril
Violent armed conflicts with the republican government broke out, especially in Cartagena, which **tried to become a US state** to get rid of government aggression (obviously they didn't succeed LOL)
Finally, in 1874 the republic went to shit and the monarchy was reinstated, ending a very intense year for the history of Spain
Don't know who were the best sailors, but there's no doubt that the English have always been better at marketing
I will not be the one to judge the conquistadores from today's point of view, but just as we can agree that the Romans came to plunder gold, lead, iron, copper and silver from the iberian peninsula and we don't call it roman gold, I think we can stop calling american gold as spanish gold
I didn't know the English Armada, very interesting, now I want to know more
Ehh, yes, the mother of my best friend in primary school was named Socorro and I once saw her in the distance in public and started shouting her name without thinking it twice
Of course I felt the stare of everybody in there asking themselves why a smiling kid with no apparent troubles was shouting for help
Everybody except Socorro, who didn't notice I was calling her
Auxiliadora is another name meaning helper, (usually shortened to Auxi)
Anyway these names do exist but are very infrequent and practically non-existent between younger generations
From what I've been told, they are named after different "virgins" and statues/idols of Virgin Mary
You have la Virgen de los Dolores, la Virgen del Valle, la Virgen del Camino, de la Soledad
So girls would literally be named Pain, Valley, Path, or Solitude
They're names from different Catholic virgins, and usually go with María before (i.e. María Dolores)
Yes :)
is pronounced exactly as it is written
you re welcome :)
Yes, true
There were many reasons to do it
They didn't risk a fleet just for the lols
They were provoked by the English
Idk if it's 'common' to have Socorro mixed with María, I only got to know that Socorro in my whole life and I was just a kid
But if I remember correctly, the Maria X or the José Y thing was a thing only because during the dictatorship (although it could well be a longer tradition) the government wouldn't register anybody without the name of a Saint, so if your parents wanted to use any name out of the list of saints, they had to append another first or second name from the list, and José and Maria were just the default ones
Nowadays you can use any name for your kids
Well, I'm going to be more precise and say that the second "LL" (Llu**LL**) is pronounced more like a long L, but you can't escape from the initial LL
The name "Socorro" comes from "Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro" or a Virgen María del Socorro
So I guess that is why he asked
Some are (like Maria Dolores) but Socorro is usually standalone
We'd just have to bring [Basque Pelota] back to the Olympics
There would be good competition, but I think that Spain would have a good chance
Nah, partying until late would be our sport
Spain enters the chat
I think you forgot about us
An example: "me cago en la puta madre que te pario" translates to "i shit on the whore mother that bore you"....that's spanish for "fuck you".
"Basketball without the US" should be a sport
Here they don't open another cashier even if the building is on fire
It's exasperating, especially compared to others like Mercadona where as soon as there are two people waiting they open a new one
Nah, but Argentinians would be the REAL champions, they would say: "Me cago en reputa vieja que te recontra pario" along with other creative insults like  tobogán de piojos if you are bald or cementerio de canelones if you are fat
1 to 15
they like those chances
I'd pay to see that
But It has to be the maggot cheese
Escaños en Blanco, it's a party against the current political climate and system
There's no representatives
You just vote them and they don't get their salary, they just never go to the Congress, hence the name (Escaños en Blanco translates to Empty Seats
Surprisingly there are still Carlist parties in Spain
Long story short: Ferdinand VII of Spain dies in 1833, leaving a daughter, Isabella
His wife, María Cristina, becomes Regent until Isabella comes of age
However, some consider that a woman should not be able to inherit the crown due to the Salic law, present in French royalty (the Bourbon house), but not in Spanish tradition (neither the Trastámara nor the Habsburg), so they rally around Carlos, younger brother of Ferdinand
After a civil war, Isabella's supporters control the country, she reigns, and her son eventually becomes King
She is the great-great-grandmother of the current King
Some 180 years after the beginning of Carlism, there are still some parties that consider our current King to be illegitimate and instead support the heir of the Infante Carlos
Why
Well don't ask me
It's true that there are ideological differences (Carlists were hardline catholics, ultra-nationalists and absolutists) but we're in the 21st century, so
Teruel Existe is a somewhat normal party but it was made to spread that Teruel (a “city” in Spain) exists
I support them
>[Partido del Karma democrático]
>Their goals are the use of humour, drugs and free love as a mean to solve the problems
You reminded me how fast life changes
When finally the UK decides to go on Its main leader may die
I wonder if that will change anything or not
I have carlists in my family, it is very easy to explain
There is no logic in a monarchist mind
They learned it from their  parents, and their parents from the grandparents and so on
It's like a football team; you sing the songs, wear the uniform, cheer with your team etc
Yeah, I think they are the ones I'm voting in the next elections
India I think
You know, you couldn't tell from maps because of the projection, but when I last checked, Sweden has like 2/3 the surfice of Spain
Yeah Portugal
It's not as small as Switzerland but it's not bad
I knew a few guys from mali in spain
Yup
I was certain Sweden was larger until I saw the numbers
Idk, it's something very subjective
But I think of Portugal like France or Spain but I don't think of in it the same way as Switzerland, Kosovo or Panamá
That sounds amazing, we need to have some here, because so far I haven't seen it
Not sure about specific trains
I've never seen one taking the AVE or Cercanías
However, in the UK, there's at least one per train
València
When you live in that city you learn to love it and hate it at the same time in the best possible way
So many things are wrong with it, but you don't want to leave at all
It's a close call between Salamanca and Toledo but I think I have to say Toledo
Former capital, beautifully preserved old center with buildings from a variety of major architectural eras, near several wine regions, direct connection to Madrid by train
I don't know that I would want to live there though since there are a lot of tourists year-round but it is very beautiful
For everyone who has been in Granada, it is difficult to find reasons to justify any other city in Spain is more beautiful
Foreigners and Spaniards oftenly agree in this point, which is not the same than saying it's the best city to live in
I am in love with Vitoria which is in País Vasco
One of the best places to party, see cultural sites, and Pinxos
Tourist-wise, I fell in love with Seville
Baroque and Modernism at its finest
Also it's flat, has lots of gardening and you can eat well
Quoting a famous song here in Spain, *Seville has a special colour*.
Oh boe
One gurl here almost went to jail for making memes over a dead francoist minister I think we have S tier shitpost here
Okay, since lot of you are asking
\-We have the guy that [got slapped] after trying to "prank" some random delivery guy
\-The ["holy shit dude I forgot to turn it on
"] guy
\-[Chicote] our own Ramsey
\-[Bald cepeda] a famous spanish musician that got photosoped bald for being a choosing beggar (paying in recognition)
\-[I don't even know how to translate this]
\-[For the rats
\-"[Nos hemos quedao sin cena] A must-have-meme in Christmas
\-["Nos hemos quedao sin cena"] paella edition
\-A lot of shitposting for "[aquí no hay quién viva]
And for the last, the best
The [first spanish astronaut] Carrero Blanco, a francoist minister that got killed during a bomb attack, and whose car flew over one entire 5 floor building
The best part is that, one girl got charged and [went to trials for making tweets] (read them, they are in national court trial)
After that everyone started making memes of that
&#x200B;
We suck at a lot of things, but most of our memes are pure gold
Terrible, spanish memes are about politics and celebrities, and Spanish people also see a lot of Latin American memes written with a bit of Spanglish sometimes and a lot of orthographic mistakes taken from Facebook groups made by 12 year old
Only a very few sometimes can be good and even become a English speaking meme too like the outstanding move meme
Some good Spanish memes can go to r/yo_elvr, the Spanish speaking me_irl
English speaking memes are way better
Our meme game is usually weak (aside from politics) but Spanish Twitter is wild
Spanish speaking memes are right there at the top with the English ones
It's the benefit of having a language with a huge amount of speakers: there's a lot of variety and exchange among many different countries
As good as Finnish or Polish memes might be, they can't compete with the amount of memes that Hispanics put out there and transcend to other languages (like "El risitas")
Some memes even have an indirect Spanish origin, like the distracted boyfriend meme, which comes from Spanish stock photos
The Hispanic meme scene isn't as big in reddit because we have our own communities, but there are still a lot of good things in Latin American subs and r/yo_elvr, r/LatinoPeopleTwitter and national subs like r/Mexico
spanish memes are all on recent political events
some girl almost got arrested for a meme of a dead dictator we had almost 100 years ago
the ones that aren’t political are just straight out stupid
english memes>
We really don't know where to stop, huh
LOVE these
PD: Nos han abandonado
:'(
You are going to be surprised, but he's not a meme here (i mean, we still laugh at it when we see it online, but we don't make things about him)
In fact, he's speaking spanish, and it's really weird when he's talking and there are captions in different languages haha
Was an option too, but I didn't want to flood the comment
Actually I'm gonna add it now, thanks for pointing it out
Our meme culture > Literally everything else
Nuestro humor es muy humor y mucho humor
>Nos han abandonado
:'(
A qué te refieres con esto
Any example
haha
I have a Chrome extension that converts units automatically to metric
Everything metric, if you're interested
I have just removed the recommended subreddits from my feed, no politics, no worldnews (cancer), that kind of stuff
And I try to clean my subreddit once in a while, so I actually only see content I really want to see, not something the algo want me to see
I follow the subs i want and unsubscribed from default bullshit
No, as other said, I only browse the subs I am subscribed to and I like
Some days ago I tried r/all and it was full of American stuff that I couldn't care less
It felt like Facebook, yikes
Also, I use Reddit from my phone with the app "Boost for Reddit" 99% of the time
I have never really liked Reddit in desktop
I dunno, call me youngling
Just out of curiosity, why is worldnews cancer
Yeah, it does that but I can live with it
Lots of clickbaity anxiety generating titles, lots of American stuff, Orange man this Orange man that
Since I removed it, my Reddit experience is a 7/10, 10/10 with rice
Really liked Mérida and its roman ruins
The latin class school trips were great
I can't imagine what it must've felt visiting a place like that as a child
I went to  Sachsenhausen last summer when I was in Berlin and we specifically picked the last day of the trip
It was such a depressing experience, but at the same time very necessary
We went with a guide and there were a couple of children with their families
Some were too young in my opinion
That being said, I've never saw Spanish children so quiet and attentive during a guided tour
Specific talks in school, biology class, parents and mostly, "the word of the street".
Parents and school
In Spain we are culturally very open with eachother
They gave us at 11-12 years
Agreed
Some important members of the Bagrationi dinasty, the former royal family of Georgia, used to live in Spain
Also, the presumptive heiress of the Russian Empire, Maria Vladimirovna, was born and raise in Spain too
I don't know if it can be called a "relation", but at the XIX century a region in Spain (Murcia) declared independence and started a war against the central Spanish government
They asked USA for help, asking the president to become (in some way) part of the states and use the American flag so the Spanish government could not attack and siege the city
More info can be found [here] in Spanish
Maybe the English Wikipedia has something too
Nicolás Maduro will blame any country for anything that happens there
The Canton of Cartagena was such a meme
They didn't have a red flag to fly over the city so they used an old ottoman flag they found
They also briefly considered declaring war on the German Empire because one of their ships was sunk in a skirmish with a German ship
Looks really quaint - and they make sure to tell all visitors about their [Finnish origin
I'm half Irish and half Spanish
Even if I feel a connection to Ireland and love Irish culture and history, I've lived in Spain all my life, and for all intents and purposes I'm a Spaniard
I don't speak English with an Irish accent, nevermind speaking Irish
I'm not up to date on Irish current events and politics, I just have general knowledge of what's going on, and what family members tell me, but that's it
If you asked me to choose in between my two countries, I'd have to choose Spain
Despite loving Ireland, I think it would be very hard for me to adapt if I wanted to live there long-term, and, I can't stand the weather lol
My father is from Spain, and my mother is half Norwegian half Irish/Scottish, I mainly identify with Spain since it’s my majority since my mother’s family is more spread out
I have three half Spanish, half German nephews in their twenties and they all consider themselves to be 100% Spanish
It's just they can speak German because their fathers happen to be German
I think two of them haven't even bothered to get their German nationality
Half English and half Spanish here
And my experience is basically the same
I would add that I enjoy a pretty nice hybrid culture
Like for example when it comes to food and all that
That's very interesting
I've read that accounts of the Irish outside of the pale made by marooned Spaniards from the Armada are valued a lot by historians as they give a lot of insight into the daily life of the people and their customs
Isabella and Ferdiand of Spain:
"Oh, man
The portugues control the african coastline to the india and we want the moneys too"
What
Who are you
A crazy captain that wants to go and see if he can find India
You want us to pay for everything
What
, The king of portugal, the most sensible nation in sea matters thought you were a crazy nutjob
Ok, here have three ships, what could go wrong
"Yeah, sure, let's allow this french dude march freely to Portugal
What's the worst thing that could happen
We all should do like in TV and never say hello or goodbye at the phone
Just speak ans say whatever we have to say
Well I didn't learn "Flugmaschine" from a teacher, rather my own search, but I realized no one uses it (except for me because I think  that word is cool as fuck)
Also my English teacher once said to me that "shut up" is a very rude way to say to someone that they need to keep it quiet
yeah I don't think that one is true
Waaait so you use the same pronoun to say "she sings" and "I kissed her" are both "lei"? In Spanish it would be "ella canta" and "la besé". I assumed Italian would work similarly
Then you have to say BS like "emparedado" and "cierra el pico".
We say «¿Qué tal
» here in Spain
"¿Qué tal
" is the standard greeting in Spain, sometimes followed by "¿Cómo estás?". It's like saying "How is it going
How are you
Pronto is "soon" in Spanish, which is not "make it quick" but could be understood as such in phrases like "vamos a terminar pronto/let's finish early"
That's exhausting
Personally, I've grown used to have less verbal interaction and gesture more, like nodding in acknowledgement instead of speaking a "Gracias".
I love this new power you just gave me
I just love germans, y'all are built differently <3
Pronto is "soon" in Spanish, so maybe it's not Italian after all
Is "l'" the contraction for "la" or for "lei"? Or is "lei" an indirect pronoun
For example, "le di un regalo" (I have her/him a gift)
«¿Qué tal
» is the shorter version of «¿Qué tal estás?», for me they both mean the same
I live in Madrid and here people use both versions, idk if it's a regional thing
What ThePedrolui said: "¿Qué tal
" is the shortened version of "¿Qué tal estás?" which means "How are you
"¿Cómo estás?" means "How are you
" too
Sometimes we use both, one after the other: "¿Qué tal
, ¿Cómo estás?" = "How is it going
How are you
Yes, it has basically the same meanings
We also have an extra meaning, when you meet someone and you say «¿Qué tal
», it means «How are you
Similarly in Spanish
Pronto = soon
To add to the confussion, "de pronto" means "suddenly" in Spanish from Spain
Valencia stays like that in English
But in French is "Valence" and I really love it
I like the names in Spanish but I don't like the names in English because they're literally just the neme in Spanish but pronunciated (?) wrong
Madrid - Mehdrieed
Barcelona -  Buarsselonna
Ibiza - Aivissa
I only like Donostia (technically it's not Donostia in Spanish, it's San Sebastián) because the pronunciation doesn't and Sevilla (Seville, pronounced "Sevil") because it's a similar name but with nicer pronunciation
I think "Sevilla" is OK but "Seville"? I hate the english translation
Also, i don't like the way english speakers pronounce "Toledo" and really like the way they say "Ibiza".
Mm TIL
At least in Spanish it's actually pronounced like the name
The spelling is "Sofía" just like the name
It's not wrong, it's just how the name was adapted in our language
We had to cancel it this year but I hope to see you around next year
Es que se escribe Sofía en español XD
Definitely Cuenca
When you don't know where, how or what, it is definitely in Cuenca
Everything around Madrid, Spain it's just Madrid + the Coast
Teruel or Soria
Most of central Spain could be included
Extremadura and any of the two Castiles
Castilla-La Mancha
It’s pretty much a bulls-eye with Madrid at the center and the coast at the rim, with everything else being pretty much in the middle of nowhere
Or you might say the middle of nowhere is actually in the middle of somewhere
Castille
What once used to be the most powerful european kingdom, now is a vast plain land with a few old people living there
pretty much all of inland spain except Madrid
Peple have been moving from there to the big cities for the last 2 centuries or so, so  its comparable to the Midwest in US
If you want to see truly desserted parts of Spain theres a [map]
Well, In Europe "the middle of nowhere" is smaller than in the US, but in Spain it would be probably Castilla La Mancha, Teruel or Soria
Extremadura and to a lesser extent Castilla-La Mancha
Not really, that's where we make people look to
Edit: but yeah, La Mancha and Extremadura qualify due to big towns and big lands in between
Teruel
The entire so-called [Spanish Lapland]
But yeah you say it because it's nowhere
like Teruel and Extremadura
But you could say la Gomera too
La España olvidada
Everything that hasn't coast or is Madrid
It's like an internal donut of nothingness
Literally
It was a big trend for people to move to from the inside of Spain full of emptiness and little towns to the big industrial cities
People tend to go back in holidays or weekends to see the family and relax
While there's plenty of programs to help save depopulated villages, in many cases its already too late
I've seen my own share of ghost towns
In a nutshell, eventually over time as people make their lifes in the city and the reasons to go back fade away, villages slowly dissapear
I would say in Spain the cycle is:
People from small towns -> bigger cities to study or work around the age of 20 +/- 2 years -> suburbs of bigger cities around early 30’s where there is more space to raise a family
Or in the case of some of my friends, move to the big city with possibilities, give up on city, move back to their parents house :(
This is true
However, thanks to the pandemic and companies opening to remote work, there has been a recent wave in the opposite direction, people moving from big cities to towns (I did)
As a native English speaker, I have never seen “a vibe” used in this context before
I kid you not when I say that once i saw a "beware haunted zone" sign in an abandoned village up a hill
I can't remember it
We were hiking around and a man pointed us in the direction
Now that I think of it he may have been a ghost
A moonbrella
When I worked close to Seattle, I read more than a few news articles about tourists in some parks taking pictures close to bear cubs
They made the news because Mama grizzly bear was always close, and  not very happy about it
How popular is rugby in your country
It seems like it’s most popular in the British Isles within Europe, adding France and perhaps Italy to the list
I was surprised to see it’s quite popular in Georgia
It's well known but not very popular
There are local clubs but apart from that I've never seen on TV a rugby match
Football outshines everything here
I've been playing for six years in Madrid
Not very popular but growing fast and it is moderately popular in some cities like Valladolid, and within the university students in Madrid
In my whole life I haven't heard of anyone that plays it
It has some people interested, but there isn't a huge national league
Europe is still a football centered continent
I had a Kiwi bid back in uni
Because if him I got into rugby
When I make it to NZ I have to watch a match at Eden Park
A rugby match and Six60 in Aotearoa
It’s definitely not popular in the U.S. in my opinion, but little by little more people are becoming aware of the sport
I saw a few Rugby 7s Championship matches in California in late February before COVID-19 started its world tour
I've met a few in Catalonia and Valencia, not sure if it's a local thing
Anyway, it's almost non-existent for the general public
There are some people playing in Asturias
The Uni even has their own team
But we're probably talking 100 people
And I've only heard about this because I happen to know two players
Otherwise
I wouldn't have
I buy UHT milk, so I only refrigerate it after I've opened it
As for eggs, yes, I refrigerate them too
It's not necessary but it keeps them from spoiling a week or two past the expiration date
Milk goes to the fridge whenever it's open at least once so it keeps fresh
(We usually buy brick packs of 6)
We always have our eggs refrigerated in Spain
I buy them non-refrigerated and keep the milk non-refrigerated unless opened and the eggs refrigerated
Chocolate out of the fridge
We buy pasteurised fresh milk so we have to put it in de fridge (because it's not uperized)
Sometimes we get it directly from the farms and if you don't boil it and put it in the fridge bacteria will make their work and you will obtain [something similar to yogurt] Some people here like it that way
Eggs don't go in the fridge and milk only goes in the fridge if the bottle is open
UHT Milk (the most common here in Spain and other parts of Europe) must be stored in the firdge once you open it (and must be consumed within one or two weeks), but until then I keep it out as  it takes a lot of space and can last in good conditions for months (in a fresh and dry place)
You might be used to fresh milk, which is sold already refrigerated and you must keep it refrigerated
Also you don't usually buy milk 6-packs as you would with UHT because it doesn't last for that long
Eggs in Europe are sold not-refrigerated, you can refrigerate they at home (I do so) as they last for longer, but once eggs are refrigerated you must strictly keep the cold chain
Basically the same for Spain
> standard fresh
Fresh is only standard in some countries
Here the standard is UHT
UHT is the the default and in many cases only option in Spanish supermarkets
I guess there might be historical reasons for it but I couldn't say
Now you can find "fresh" (pasteurised) milk in some places but it is still kind of a novelty
In Spain it is not common to have leftovers either, not only because portions are usually adequate and people try not to order too much, but also because the one thing that is actually frowned upon is not finishing your plate (for cultural reasons I can only especulate about)
I don't think it's ever been a problem to ask for a doggy bag but most people were not used to that
Nowadays takeout food is much more common and even normal restaurants offer some, so it's far less weird to take your leftovers home
I'm a bit taken aback by other spaniards saying is not common at all in Spain
I've done it my whole life, sometimes even being the waiter the one asking if I would like to take the rest home
It might be a Galician thing since a person said is mandatory by law here, but yeah, completely normal in my experience
Ps: Asking for a doggy bag if you go to each ribs (for the bones) is also quite common, even among older people, so i don't think it's something we implemented because of american movies
It's has been and still is unheard of in Spain
At least that's my experience
It would be ridiculous to try to take the remains of a tapa for obvious reasons
But it would also be a weird request for a regular dish, no matter how much you have left
The same here
It's a fairly new thing
I think it's a common thing in Southern Spain
In the Canary Islands the portions are massive
I had to teach myself to order properly
like, I can only do with a main and feel satisfied and full
The mentality of having and entrée, a main and dessert doesn't work here if you want to stay thin and healthy
I live in Catalonia and I've seen restaurants offering this to tourists, as it's well known it's an acceptable habit in other places
Not so common for locals, but I have no clue about the Canary Islands TBH
In some places the portions are not that adequate, I don't remember where exactly it was, but in a restaurant in Galicia with my girlfriend we ordered something like caldo for the both of us and they basically gave us a pot that could have fed 4 people at least
Obviously it was supposed to be only the first plate, so we didn't even eat half of it, the second was a bit more adequate, but still too much
Had a similar experience in Asturias with fabada, but that time I was so hungry I ate like an animal
I guess it depends on where
Here in the north it's quite common to have leftovers because the portions are relatively large
And yeah, it's normal to take it home, the waiter will usually ask whether you want to
Yeah, that's what I was going to say
I have taken leftovers home many times, especially pizza (there are some places where pizza can be huge), or with children
Obviously it depends on the food you are eating or the restaurant
Not really that common here in Madrid
I've seen it mostly when kids are involved
The general idea is that you ask for what you're going to eat, so if you don't finish "it's your fault" (???)
However as they said it's getting more common
I think there's a cultural divide somewhere In the north
In my experience, much closer to what the other commenter said
Unheard of some years ago, but became pretty common pretty quick and it is not unusual anymore
The last few years there's been talk about food waste it and people are starting to practice it
In big cities its become more normal and acceptable
Here in Andalusia it has become common in recent years
I do it sometimes and all restaurants has containers for it
But that's not a portion, they literally give you a whole pot so you can take as much or as little as you want instead of being served a generic amount
Nobody expects you to finish all of it, even though I'm pretty sure some people do or at least try
Asturias IS just on a different league
They serve as if you had one and a half stomachs
I've seen what I can only describe as monstrous cachopos
Forget the classic "for 2 people" you'd need a whole batallion to finish those
You seem to be a rational person, then
My friends in the north would be caught dead before leaving something in the plate
I went to a grill buffet with them and I was completely full half an hour before they stopped eating
I'm not entirely sure they are human
You are not expected to, of course (thanks God)
But the fact that you could eat it all is already quite baffling
I always wondered if they then serve what you do not eat from that pot to someone else or what happens after
Oh, no, I'm not one of the rational ones, that's my friends who leave food
I'll eat until I'm sick xD
Yeah
but that's not how it usually goes here
Rations are generally modest
If anything's left it's usually very little
Most times when someone asks for the leftovers it's down to kids, as they might not finish their food
Btw, That's how it generally works
There's plenty of exceptions
I've been served half a cow in Asturias (northern Spain)
However, you would just adapt and order less, rather than take the food home
There's also a culture of cooking your own food
Going out to a restaurant is seen as very especial
Smth you may do once a month (more or less)
There's also, at least here In Spain, a "scourge" associated with "not finishing your food". That's one other reason why kids are often the ones who don't finish
They haven't "learned" to order and eat "properly". So even if what you say makes total sense, it's contextualised by our take on food
>All through my upbringing i was told to think of the poor children in Africa when I didn't finish my plate
Same
[This one] it's QWERTY
&#x200B;
Adding more text so the post it's not deleted automatically without any kind of warning because it's to short, yes I'm making this post longer, just ignore this text
Well, could you find the differences
there are stuff like  the Ñ, the Ç and the ¡ ¿ symbols
QWERTY
With Spanish letter such as ñ and all the accents
When I have to write in French I use the Swiss keyboard (which is also QWERTY) because AZERTY or however is called it's just cursed
QWERTY but with the Ñ under the P and to the left of the L
QWERTY with acute and grave accent diacritics (`, the other isn't in my phone), ñ and ç
Same in Spanish
All of those characters are easy in the Spanish layout
Plus "ç", because of Catalan
Honestly, take the Spanish layout, add a "~" so you can write Portuguese, and boom, you have a Western Latin layout
Oh, yeah
We had some computers with Italian keayboards at my uni, don't ask me why, and at first I tought they were French because of the Ç.
Any particular reason why shift+letter doesn't get you the capital one
Is it because there are several accented letters in the same key
By the way, I realized that you can write letters like ã with the Spanish layout easily
Yeah, the Spanish one is good for all the Western Romance languages, or at least the major ones
Ouch
Then I don't see any advantage to your keyboard
You could migrate to ours and would probably have an easier time
Spain
Great Hispanic Emperor's and legions
I believe it was the IX Hispania
The iberian peninsula was the most romanized region in western europe besides the italic peninsula itself imo
The peoples quickly adopted roman language, culture, and roman names, to the point that all of the names of peasants recorded at the start of the Asturian kingdom were roman, and unlike the britons, they didnt just destroy everything and go back to iron age behavior when the roman empire fell
The 3 places I lived in with big Roman heritage took great care of it:
\- France (the motherland): tons of Roman stuff everywhere
I'm from the South and there is an infinity of well preserved "Arenes" (usually still used), aqueducts, bridge, path, and many cities have actually been founded by the Ancient greek or the Romans
\- Spain, same, tons of stuff everywhere
\- UK, England/Scotland was the very edge of the Roman Empire
The Museum of London has great content on London's Roman heritage
Not as much stuff as in more Southern nations, but until Hadrian wall, you can see a lot of stuff
Spain
Others have already commented on the linguistic, cultural and architectural influence
I want to emphasize that the legacy is still alive, Rome is still in the news every day
In my city, works began on a street in the old city and, as soon as they had begun to dig the ground, they found Roman walls used as foundations for the current houses, as well as other remains
Last month, some works in a hotel in the same city found other Roman ruins with objects
And this is something that is happening all over the country, we are constantly hearing about this kind of thing
1500 years and a few invasions later, every time we want to build something that involves a little digging, the past hits us in the face to remind us that we were Romans
And (now I'm going to generalize) people are happy about these discoveries, are proud of them and want them to be preserved, so I guess, deep down, we all feel a little bit Roman
You are right that the native customs did survive for quite a long time - this is because for a long time and in many places, there were parallel societies of Romans and Celtiberians, so there were holdouts of Celtiberian culture
Sheep herding is not very particular to Spain and is widespread globally so I don’t know if it’s any more “original Spanish” than the olive, which is cultivated all over the Mediterranean but seems to have originated in Italy according to current evidence
And many of the other things you mention are not relevant to modern society anymore
It’s hard to talk about these things because the history has been warped by nationalists from all sides, and also there is a generalised human desire that who were are today gets passed on in some form to posterity
So we want there to be traces of the Celtiberians in our culture
And maybe there are some, but there is scant evidence for it today
We know quite a lot about what spoken Latin sounded like and it was quite far from Romanian which has far more complex vowels
In terms of what it sounded like, about equal measure to Italian and Spanish, but several consonants were different (they had no sound equivalent to the English J or V for instance, the J was like a Y and the V like a U)
Lived two years in England, where to start
- Shaking hands with women when you meet them
That awkward phase when you see them again but you're not familiar enough with each other to hug them
- Awful eating habits - saw plenty of students pass on rice dishes with meat and vegetables for some fries, pizza and beans
FOR LUNCH
- Being absolutely wasted by 00
00, whereas that's normally when you leave the house in Spain
Also, how some English girls choose to wear very short and sleeveless dresses in January
- Also, the inane amount of make-up English women wear
It was astonishing, from a very young age too
- Ranking of schools
Immense pressure on teachers and departments
On a more positive note:
- Way more freedom in how to dress
Really stood out in sixth form and college
Many people chose more risky or alternative styles of clothing, and no-one bat an eye
I feel Spain is more conservative regarding this
- Bigger amount of vegetarians and vegans, also from a young age
- A significantly noticeable respect for public and personal space
People don't shout, push, have loud conversations on the phone, keep music to a minimum, avert eye contact if possible, but are also very polite and helpful if needed
As an extrovert I struggled with this at first, but it must be heaven for introverts
- A greater appreciation of local culture
It was easier to come across live music, art galleries and drama shows with lots of attendance
When people eat bad Paella in places that are not Valencia
And believe its a food from all of Spain
People shouting
Amsterdam-style coffee shops exist in Spain (well, not exactly)
There is a "loophole" thanks to which coffee shops are legal, or rather, alegal (but not ilegal)
Selling weed is illegal, but it is legal to grow for your own consumption
This means that you can set up a kind of "co-operative" that essentially works as a smokers' club
As long as you pay a membership (mine is a monthly one), you can go to your club and buy weed
In theory, you can only smoke it there
Since the weed is only sold internally to club members this is not considered as production with commercial purposes, it is grown for self consumption by the club members
All profits must be reinvested in the club - they work as non-for-profit organisations
The best part is that a lot of people have no idea these places exist
They can't advertise and normally you can only become a member through invitation by another member
From the outside, they look like empty commercial spaces
The weed and other derived products are more expensive than on the street, but there is a lot more variety and the quality is much, much better (there's quality weed on the street too, but it's harder to find)
Also, in these places they have music, boardgames, videogames, TVs, books
So you can spend your evening just chilling, playing some chess, or making new friends
S/O, ha
That’s a good one
"Te quiero"
"Te amo"
Although both mean "I love you", "Te amo" is much more meaningful
Whereas "Te quiero" can be said to friends and family too, "Te amo" is usually reserved for your SO
"SO, jajajajajajaja"
Translation:  "SO, hahahahahahaha"
Esa sensación cuando te das cuenta de que probablemente vas a morir virgen xD
Although "te amo" sounds very soap-opera-ish
I like to say "te adoro" (I cherish you), I love the sound of it
>Hit her with the tongue in the native I love you
>always works
Of course not
I'm left handed…
Well Franco stood in power until his dead, so
Obviously during his regime there was no democracy, not even ''fake elections'' and there was a brutal repression and social paranoia about communists, socialists and masonry  (Yes, the story tells that Franco tried to join a Mason group, they rejected him, and then he hated them so much lol)
Declare a war
Against ourselves
Being a traitor to the democratic republic and starting a civil war with half a million victims
Francisco franco
Thats not completely true, yes, he won the elections
An elections where the main opponents had been illegalized, imprisoned, murdered, had been exiled or were being coerced
So yeah, he won the elections, but a *democratic* election
Never
He betrayed all the monarchists that were in his side during the civil war, after promising them to restore the monarchy
And he kept all the power for himself for decades
To be honest I’m not sure you can blame any politician for Brexit
You guys voted out
I mean, he did restore the monarchy in 1947, it's just that he proclaimed himself "regent for life".
> the best the Nazis did in free and fair elections (despite voters being "nudged" by the SA) was only a bit more than one third of seats in the Reichstag
Which is still a fucking ton
This is funnysad (it has english subtitles)
&#x200B;
I wonder how a dane (or another tourist) would react after a stranger telling to use sunscreen at the beach
Yes, I read in class that in the Victorian Era having tuberculosis was seen as fashionable because it make the skin look paler and more fragile looking with the thin/ethereal enhanced look
Incredible how aesthetics and fashion standards can change with time
Did your skin ever got more used to the uv index down here, or you would have burnt the last day if you had been less careful just like the first day
Yeah, just google it
They also used things like arsenic as makeup to look paler
Yikes
In Spain we make jokes about each other's accents but I seriusly doubt anyone takes accents as something important
At the end of the day why should I care about how anyone talks as long as I understand them
Keep in mind Spain is a quite diverse country in the matter of accents and dialects
Each region has a different accent and some regions have even languages of their own such as Catalan, Gallego and Euskera
Murcian and andalusian accents are seen as a stigma, rest of Spain make fun of us, specially politicians and high class people
We make fun of each other
no one understand people from Galicia, Catalans speak like snobs, the Aragonese sound like farmers with diarrhoea and so on
As fellow Spaniards said, we mock a lot national accents
Andalucia (and some people from the Canary Islands) suffers the most from this
Andalusians have the known stereotypes of being lazy
Other accents live normally in peace
Now from my perspective, asian accents like Chinese are also mocked in a somewhat racist way but I would say that the general opinion has changed in their favor
(I don't want to say Spain is racist)
With Europeans we usually just make fun of the French:
***~~^(Una sena de picogteo)~~***
Latin America is so funny
Both sides are always in war regarding how to speak and both sides have stupid people
Except in the case of foreigner accents, there's xenophobe people in every country sadly
"We make jokes about each other's accents"
Can confirm, I live in Murcia
>In Spain we make jokes about each other's accents but I seriusly doubt anyone takes accents as something important
This is plainly and unfortunately untrue
Andalusian accent is still heavily stigmatized and looked down on
Add Extremadura too
But Galician accent is seen as uncultured, Catalan accent as effeminate, the accent from Madrid is posh, basque accent is coarse
If we Spaniards have a characteristic I would say it's to be assholes towards other Spaniards
My ex, who was from NRW (near Düsseldorf) would constantly make fun of Bavarian accent
and the accent from Cologne
it was so curious for me to see that Cologne does have a very different accent although it’s so near to Düsseldorf
I lived in a city with 200
000 inhabitants and its different boroughs had different accents some decades ago, that’s very surprising for me too
Not to speak about the German from elderly and the German from young people
I had a hard time in the hospital where I worked, and with some of the family members of my ex too
whereas I could speak perfectly with people aged 2 to 40
It’s not the accent that is considered lazy, it’s the people, different thing
And yeah, they sort of are more lazy than the rest but it’s mostly because of the heat so kinda understandable
What we think of the accent it’s that is fast, and not understandable
¿Murcia
¿Donde esta eso
Entre Teruel y Narnia supongo :)
> Catalan accent as effeminate
I have never heard this, for Galician I'd say people say it's rustic and that's not necesarily bad
Mexico with their "wey" "no mames" "la concha de tu madre" it's so true and stereotypical at the same time
I do and I'm catalan ;-)
Nah, Chilean immigrants are very uncommon in Spain (better economy than neighbors probably) and a lot of people don't recognize Chilean accent because we don't interact with Chileans often
We have more exposure to dialects from Argentina, Caribe, Colombia, Peru, etc
Argentinian is probably the most imitated one
But a lot of Spanish women find it sexy, lol
I’m catalan too and I’ve never heard of it
and I don’t think that the accent in Madrid is considered posh, it’s more of a *cuñao* accent :P
Nobody fucking cares
It's completely normal
Nope
It's uncommon but no one will pay any attention to you or judge you
I agree
I see a lot of people eating alone the "menu del día" in restaurants and bars for lunch and nobody cares
I understand that it would be weird in fancier restaurants, but in a McDonalds
That's why I eat normally man
If the judge considers you could flee then you're sent to preventive prison until trial
- It's a regional dish so maybe it's cheating, but [Murcian meat pies]  are amazing
It's a crusty pastry filled with meat, chorizo, egg and spices, and it's a very traditional dish that comes from medieval times
- Differen stews with [lentils]  [beans]  [chickpeas]  and many others
They are very traditional and nutritious, but I don't think they are usually linked to Spanish cuisine except for [fabada asturiana]  and [cocido madrileño]  and still I'm not sure if they are very well known
- [Broken eggs with iberic ham]
- [Bull's tail stew]
There's so many rice recipes apart from paella which are much better in my opinion
Arroz al horno "oven rice" is my favourite
Black rice with squid's ink is a also great
Really interesting, the same dish cooked with leftovers is called "Ropa vieja" also here, but it is made with legumes and meat
Wondering why is it given such unique name
There's a dish in Spain called "Ropa Vieja" made from leftovers
It is delicious
One of the best things I tried in the Netherlands
I would also add "Cargols a la llauna" (basically snails), from Catalonia
Either you hate them or you love them
Now I'm craving some fabes con almejas
What about asados
Not exactly unique, but it's crazy good
Of course, every spaniard knows what to eat in Segovia, but I think their existance is pretty unknown outside our country
Maybe you are referring to [torreznos]  they can be made from frying different parts of the pig's body, including the belly, and the [face]  The frontal part of the face is called "morro" and the cheeks are usually called "careta".
Snails are a rather common snack in bars in the south too
It is, once I checked it out and we extended torreznos everywhere we went
Funny enough in China they make a similar product (totally unrelated) but the Filipino version comes from us
[48] one of them in my hometown, [la llotja de la seda]
the Alhambra
The Alcazar
"Santiago de compostela"
Toledo
Burgos Cathedral
the number is
42 cultural
4 natural
2 mixed
and 4 are shared with Portugal or France
agh you guys have more and more
we had been in 3º place for years
Another one in my hometown,
We're third only after Italy and China
You could easily have three times that amount
>Zamość,
I went there and everyone kept asking me why
I liked It very much
>the Bizkaia Bridge
Been there, it's worth very much the visit
>Like the whole city
I mean the whole ancient city
It's still pretty big
Anything inside the walls of urban VIII
It's quite common
For example in Spain we have one about primeval beech forest which we share with 11 countries
In the adriatic i visited the same WHS 3 times, "Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar" in kotor, sibenik and zadar
Obviously It extends to Italy aswell
The debate if the potato omelette must have or not onion
It is more than anything a matter of taste, but it has divided Spaniards for generations
Our greatest debate is wether Spanish omelette has to be cooked with or without onions, also known as the incorrect and correct ways respectively
Also, we non-Valencians have tried for years to cook a paella deemed worthy by Valencians, so far without success
Spanish tortilla with or without onions is a reocurring one
There's a strong debate about what belongs and doesn't belong in a paella
Concebollismo o barbarie
Give me onion or give me death
People who like tortilla de patata without onion are just stupid, but I feel that this will eventually start another civil war
I'll bring preace between germans
Those are different dishes in Spain
Ensalada cateta: Potatoes, olives, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, tuna, onion, green pepper, vinegar and olive oil
Ensaladilla rusa (Olivier salad): Potatoes, peas, carrots, olives, tuna, hard boiled eggs, red pepper and mayonnaise
&#x200B;
Now you can make distinction too and stop the war
I can't believe you consider acceptable to put ketchup on pasta
my impression of Sweden as a civilized society is crumbling
Kvass is listed as an ingredient in the article you linked
My father from Madrid has sometimes been told that  his paella is as good as the best Valencian ones and I've grown up eating paella every time someone come to our house, so I kinda ended hating them
But when I went to Castellón (in the Valencian community) once and ate a paella there it was really similar to my father's
Cheese
In coffee
Are you okay neighbor
Im concerned
¡¡¡cereals first always
never pinneaple
there was even a meme here in spain with that while coronavirus striking hard
The meme was empty frozen pizza fridge on a market but pinneape pizzas hahahahaha
I'll give you a hint, not chorizo
this is so fucking true man hahahaha
fucking talibans
(for non spaniards, to call someone taliban in spain means to be extremist or really square minded)
There's none more blind than he who does not want to see
Onion makes spanish omelette worse
Onion usually makes everything worse for me because onion has a strong flavor and everything onion touches makes it tatse like just onion
Also, the real traditional spanish omelette is called TORTILLA DE PATATAS, not Tortilla de cebollas y patatas
Love you Austrian brother
Calla tonto
Problem is the texture
if u want it to be sweet just put sugar
Imagine not putting onion in your tortilla de patata
^This ^post ^was ^made ^by ^Cebolla ^Gang
Username checks out
Yes
I just did an image search and this is what i get
And even with asparragus
See
it's normal here, those are non-spicy peppers
I still had hope you could be saved, but I guess you're up to God now, or worse, the Italians
Imagine having good taste
^(The Sincebolla Gang^^TM will win this holy war)
In japan they put sake, (sugar) but obviously in the cooking process
u can do the same with normal sugar
Wow man, to know about "taliban ortografico" makes me feel amazed
If u cook wine it stays the sugar of the rice or the whatever wine u use
Hispania because Spain rhymes with pain
Thi is gonna sound wrong to you, but I really really wish the name changed to Espain
Most country names change a lot in translation, sometimes outrageously so, but they usually retain their first letter
I am used to thinking of spain as starting with E-, but usually when filling online info I have to check the list many times, unsure whether it will be listed among the countries starting with E- or with S-. It is very similar to the problem with USB drives, where you end up needing more attempts than necessary because of the insecurity
Also sometimes you will find things like Singapore, España, Swaziland
It is confusing
It is wrong
Please stop this
I actually like Germany (or Germania) and Alemania way better
I never really got the meaning of Deutschland at all
Was born in Germany btw, I'm both German and Spaniard
To avoid confusion
Maybe Magyaria since the -ia suffix is used for land
I actually love the name "Magyar", but you gotta admit the etymology for "Hungary" is also really cool (it comes from the Huns)
It's even worse in Spanish translations: you are Suiza and they are Suecia (and remember z and C sound exactly the same in those words)
I agree
The English spelling of Czechia is stupid
And Bohemia sounds much cooler too
Something that we can pronounce properly
That initial S is a pain in the ass
Another option is we get annexed by Portugal and become Iberia once again
I'd change it to "República Española" and enjoy videos of english speakers try to pronounce it
Even though no one uses it in Spanish the language is called "Neerlandés".
English spelling as a whole is just stupid sometimes
The fact that you write a word and then you just ~~invent~~ *make up* how to pronounce it tilts me in cases like this
Isn't the -nia prounced more like an "ñ"? (similar to English ca**ny**on)
100% agree but i would change it to tercera republica federal española xd
Von Vaters seite
You not having ties to the actual Huns doesn't necessarily mean the etymology of the word "Hungary" doesn't come from that name
Yes, it originally came from the Ungari nomads, but the "h" was preppended when they were confused with the Huns:
Por cierto, "invent" se usa cuando se refiere a inventos más bien
Normalmente en el sentido de inventarse algo, se usa "make up".
I mean, that's kind of a pointless point because "Czechia" literally equals "Bohemia". So "Czechia" is only one land in "Czechia" anyway
Many countries do it this way
The name of the country goes after the larger/more influential region/people group
Can relate
Now I can pronounce it if I try, but when I am speaking normally, my spanish accent comes back
Gracias
Supongo que se me ha pegado demasiado el slang, jaja
Not to be extremely picky, but I'm just curious about languages and phonology
Wouldn't you say that rather than -ña it'd be more like -ñja
Where *j* is a quick *i* (semivocalic *i*)
Oh YEAH
Nope, it doesn’t
Mit ein par Rechtschreib fehlern aber mit sprechen und verstehen habe keine probleme
Hab 7 Jahre in München gelebt
Yup I'm totally aware the Czech Republic is made up of historical Bohemia, Moravia and a tiny part of Silesia
Historial doesn't mean they don't exist today
I love french names, especially Adèle
But people would look at me super weird if I ever named my kids like that, instead of a spanish name
I would like to name my daughters as Hayley and Aoife but in Spain this could be a source of pronunciation issues haha
In spanish it would be like:
* Hayley: ailei (if they are really chavs) or Jeili (with a strong spanish "j" sound that I don't like in this name) and probably 90% of people would write it as Jeily
* Aoife: the chavs would say aoife if the read it, and if they hear how it sounds they would write Ifa (which is a supermaket in Spain)
I love a lot of Japanese names, and also some more Russian-ish like Natasha, which I absolutely love
But it would be very weird to name my kids like that here
I like the name Akesha, but I wouldn't name a kid that way
Yes, same here hahaha
Marina is a spanish nane too
Nah, It's not weird stuff
They're just talking about some poor kid that was named Son Goku da Silva
We definitely wear clothes with logos on them
HOWEVER, you friend might have perceived a big difference because people in the US (based on my own limited experience) wear them considerably more
In fact, it is something that caught my attention while I was there
I can wear a brand for their quality but if the logo is minimal I won’t choose that clothing
I’m not going to pay them to advertise them
As a Spaniard I can confirm people wear clothes with logos all the time
Might be less common than in the US (I have no idea), but you won't have to walk long until you see someone wearing something with a logo
I'm wearing a Columbia hoodie right now
It's not unusual to see, but I guess not that common like other brands
I'm sorry greeks, but Athens was a total shock
The city is
ugly in general (with notable exceptions) and i just didn't expect such a monstruosity of a city
However i ended up liking the city a lot not despite, but because of its "ugliness". somehow It just worked for me
I would go again no doubt
Beauty IS often overrated
That said you do project a very different image
France
I still have a mainly positive view of the country, but after following French politics, reading the history on things like nuclear tests and cooperation with U.S. imperialism, learning that it's basically the anti-vaccine capital of the world (per capita), and seeing some of the messed up stuff French multinationals get away with (again after I started following the news more closely), it isn't the magical place it once was in my mind
Despite losing that rosy perspective, I still want to travel France by train someday to visit its cities, see its history, meet its people, and especially explore its rich wine heritage
A lot of the things I love about Spain also apply to France so I could never hate it
I used to love the UK, since I visited it when I was like 16
The calmness compared to here, the weather (I love rain
yup
) the architecture, some parts of their culture and many other things made me fall in love with it to the point I was even planning on moving there someday, at least temporarily
Aaaaaaand then some of them ( ^(not all okay
)) thought they were still a great empire and  the people of other nations were taking their jobs, their fishes ,their women or whatever the fuck the were thinking, and then did a backflip and fall headlong to the ground
In the process betraying their brothers for about 73 years and losing a lot of things that made them Great in the first place
Just by thinking about it saddens me
Athens is like that kind of people that are rather ugly but have a charming personality that makes you fall in love
> Parisian clubs' problem with overpricing
This doesn't only happen in Paris haha
Have you Heard about the [Paris syndrome]
I'm sorry my friend but more than compliments is the biggest pile of tourist stereotypes I've read in a long time
Specifically I can't believe that the compliment for Spain, of all the things you could choose, is for bullfighting, I can even understand that you admire the courage of the bullfighters, but that the first thing that comes to your mind about Spain is that, is a defeat for us
These shows of animal brutality are fortunately in danger of extinction, prohibited in many parts of the country, and las corridas are mostly attended by a very specific type of person (right-wing, traditionalists and nationalists)
Its a minority tradition, not at all representative of today's Spain, and I am sure that most of us dont find it a compliment
You could have praised the paella which is also a great stereotype but at least it really tastes good
Edit: And I appreciate your intention to give a positive vision of each country, only I think that the example has not been good at all
idk how french restaurants works, but in Spain the kitchen only works during lunch and dinner times, if you want to eat at 12:00 or dinner at 20:00 you'll have a hard time in Spain
>It's just 4 million people packed together in grey apartments
Yeah that was the part that surprised me most, you don't Imagine how Big the city actually is until you get there
>(although the metro system us quite clean and organized)
Yeah
Though they did rob us at the metro
>Do they really project a different image
One friend of mine wanted nothing more than visiting Athens
So i would say they do, especially outside travelers
>like I felt the same when I visited Berlin,
Funny, i've been to Berlín and i felt the same, and i did like it more
Berlin isn't beautifull, but it's not as ugly as Athens
I would say it's just average, not really beautifull, not unwholy ugly
That's why i didn't write about It
Also their image isn't so romanticized
You kind of expect that Berlin is not beautifull but It is interesting
Madrid isn't beautifull either, there's beautifull chunks but i would rate the city along Berlin
However if you search "Madrid travel" you'll be way less mislead that if you search "Athens travel". I think it's because you have the acropolis to show and with some quick editing the Grey ugly boxes are out of sight
Search "Athens travel" in Google
Now, Imagine you didn't know how Athens IS
Kind of hard to tell how It is from the photos, isn't It
they only show Plaka and several ruins
That's the problem
However  i did find ONE photo which shows a bit more
>like being in a ghost city,
I don't know, it can be a bit creepy but It wasn't that bad
There's nothing like [Chiatura] Georgia
That's a Ghost city
Check out the [Paris syndrome]
I'd say it's because UK (and France and Germany) are political powers
And the UK is also a cultural power too (I've never heard of Australian or South African film industry, for example)
Its
more like the fact that (some, of course) of you put some fishes over several decades of cooperation, shared culture, commerce
Its just nothing personal, like feeling attacked, its something more like if a friend with whom we've live together for several decades just leaves because they treat him better somewhere else, except there's no somewhere else, and, as I said, that deeply saddens me
>Also Berlin is the only capital city in the world that is a net drain, our GDP would increase by like 0
2 percent or whatever without it
You're kidding
You're CAPITAL IS poorer than the rest of the country
> It's important to contribute to the spread of tourism in Greece to places other than Mykonos, Santorini, Athens and Crete, imo
Yeah, i Think so too
That Focus on the south IS really a pain
personally i liked better your forests in the north
However that's not all, the combinations are misleading
They Talk Athens and show the acropolis, then they show Santorini, until Athens looks in your mind all White and blue bellow the acropolis
I think i haven't seen one photo of Athens (from an agency) which wasn't awfully romanticized
In the case of Athens it's just worse because in some parts it's kind of a shithole
>Is 12
00 not lunch time in Spain
No, by far
I would say the Most common hour IS 14:00
When i ate at 12:30 in uni people looked at me as if i was alien
Dinner at 20:00 in a restaurant
pretty soon too
As he said you might run into problems
In Spain I've never seen or heard of a single building sharing  washing machines
I knew the concept from American shows/movies, but I thought it was just from US
These last 4-5 years I've seen some laundry places being open all over Barcelona, they're mostly used by immigrants, my guess is that landlords with cheap flats don't bother to put a washing machine anymore, but who knows, the general rule is still to have your own machine
In Madrid too
I thought it was because of the air-bnb boom
Washing machines are expensive and if you're going to have 10-15 groups of people per month in your apartment, it's only natural someone would fuck it up, so it's best not to have one and make them rely on laundry places
I'm thinking about sitcoms like Friends, Big bang theory
Scenes in the laundry room are common
I imagine, one for 20 families is not enough
Yeah you're probably right, your theory also makes sense
At least in Barcelona most of this kind of stuff is located at the center, thing is that both inmigration and airbnb can be found there, so it overlaps
Spanish wasn't mention in the post, but I'll explain them a bit just in case someone is interested:
—Termination in - ez: This termination means "Son of". So "López" means "son of Lope". And "Rodríguez" means "Son of Rodrigo"
—Surname with "de la", "del" or -es termination:  This means the place where the person is from
This kind of names are hereditary, nowadays no one makes himself a name
One famous example is "Don Quixote de la Mancha (Don Quixote of La Mancha)
But that surname is pretty rare, more common examples are "de la Rubia", "del Prado (of the meadow)", "montañés (of the mountains)"
There are other kinds of surnames in Spanish but I don't know what logic they follow
In Spanish the ending -ez is like the ending -son in English
Dominguez - Son of Domingo
Gutierrez - Son of Guti
Álvarez - Son of Álvaro
Fernandez - Son of Fernando
In Spanish many surnames end with - ez, Hernández, Martínez, Rodríguez, etc
It means son of Hernan, son of Martín, son of Rodrigo, of course now a days is no longer the name of your father but something you inherited but is cool
Also we keep the last names of both father and mother, we only really use the first 2, the first one of your father, the first one of your mother, but technically you could just keep going back and adding more and it will be accurate, i think i only know 4 of my surnames but if i sitted down with my parents we could keep going until who know how many, the order goes like this, first surname (your father one, inherited from his), then your mother(inherited from his father), then you could also add your father second surname(the one given by his mother), and same with surname of ypur mother's mother, and yeah keep doing that going back generations as much as you want
Also some of us have religious surnames like, iglesias(church), monje(priest), etc
Those were given back in the day to child without parents who were didn't have any other surname, we also have many surnames about profesions, it comes from you having some ancestor who worked on that, we also have people who has surnames which are just the name of a place, like Soria, Valencia, etc
I'm not really sure but i think those come from jewish who converted to chrsitianism, and of course we also have aristocrats surnames
Spanish -ez meaning song of
like: Pérez, Jimenez, Álvarez, Gutierrez, Gonzalez and so on
First off, i can't help you with those, if you want a spanish name i'll help you with it
However i love that you're taking your time to make the names make sense
So i wish you luck on your project
> Peréz
That'd be *Pérez* actually
-az also means "Son of" like one of my surnames, which is Díaz means "Son of Dio"
I actually know someone with that name
Not really, I would prefer to speak in my native language but thanks to the English language I can communicate with a lot of people over the world and learn a language is a good mind training
Yes, i want to share content in Spanish, one of the most spoken languages in the world, but still i can't do it outside spanish specific sites
&#x200B;
I'm almost biligual in english, but there is a lot of content in spanish that deserves credit
No, because I'm spaniard
Our language is also so important, so I don't really have a reason to be annoyed by that
Not at all
In fact, I love it
Apart from the fact that I think English is a beautiful and relatively easy to learn language (I’m not as good as in Spanish, but still I can have a conversation), it “forced me” (in a good way) to learn the language, and so that way I discovered that I enjoy learning and speaking several languages (now I am learning French)
Also if there was no universal language I wouldn’t be able to communicate, for example, with a German
If anything I'm grateful it is
On today's globalism, there is a need for a dominant language, be it English, Esperanto, or whatever
English is really easy to learn, its grammar is simple, it's easy to dominate on a day-to-day basis, and well, phonetics is hell but it's not like I have to actually speak it regularly so who cares
The fact that I'm a native speaker of the second/third most spoken language doesn't hurt either
No, it's easy to learn, specially the basics
It'd be way worse if we'd have to learn French or German
Yeah definitely
I kinda also feel bad abut, especially older, people who couldn't or didn't learn English, since it's really important
I for one like It better(America english)
Yeah, but most of the other options (french, german, spanish, italian or russian) are hard to start with and hard to master
English has a ton of words from latin roots and a lot from germanic roots, that makes it the perfect language for all western europeans to learn
Well thankfully some people can learn even when they're older but some people just can't. In Spain a lot of people have problems not knowing English, and we're a very touristic country
It's because they are lazy or because they don't care, it's just really hard
Europeans: No
Morocco: Yes, and we're being too good to them
France, Andorra and Portugal: Nah, we are bros
Gibraltar: Not really
That being said, a tax haven being adjacent to the poorest municipality in all of Spain is no mere coincidence
Morocco: **This one i find worrisome** and i'd be willing to bet their expansionist rhetoric is going to spark a major diplomatic issue in the next few years
Nope
I mean France invaded Spain a couple-three times in in the XIX century, but we good since they don't have kings or wannabe emperors anymore
As Morocco modernizes, it stays an absolute monarchy (I think) and they have tried some territorial shenanigans in the past
Also they push around their neighbours in Western Sahara, etc
So yea, living in the southern coast of Spain, Morocco is my most threatening neighbour
Then of course, the most threatening country for us, period, is the U. S., which has several military bases agreed by Franco and now we're stuck with them
Dear God, don't jynx it

"The Papal States want to know your location
I don't think you understand what protectorate means
I use more catalan than spanish on a daily basis
I can speak Asturian fluently, as almost everybody in my fathers' family
The family of my mother is also asturian but they are from the capital of the region (Oviedo) so they don't speak too much
Asturian is a language placed between Old Castillian and Gallego, in the mountains in northern Spain
I'm Galician, though I'm a *neofalante* (someone whose mother language wasn't Galician but who began to speak it regularly in adulthood)
While Galician is relatively healthier than other minority languages (around half of the population speaks it as its main language, compared to 30% of the Basques, and almost everybody knows it), it's suffering a heavy decline in usage among the younger generations (only a quarter of the children population has it as its first language)
This varies between the countryside and small towns, where it's still widely spoken, and bigger towns and cities, where Spanish is the main language you'll hear, though it isn't rare to see someone speaking Galician
I do speak Spanish and Basque (I am from the Basque country)
I also speak English, some french a very little Danish
I speak Galician, as basically everyone in Galicia speaks Galician, especially in rural areas
Valencian (or catalán depending who you ask), its pretty much compulsory at school
You learn it until you end highschool
It's common to hear it all around the region
Spanish is used more
However everybody knows how to speak it and it is used normally by people from smaller towns, with your family or with a particular friend or group
You can talk in Spanish to someone and switch to valencian to speak to the person next to it if you know they use it as the primary language
Switching back and forth from Spanish to valencian and the other way around is extremely common and it's not seen as a bad thing to switch if the other person replies differently
Speaking valencian when the other person doesn't know and not changing is seen as something very rude however
Dude, it's good
That's some really interesting insight on minority languages in the US
To sum up, I use catalan at work and with most of my friends
If I go to a restaurant or a shop, I usually notice what language the staff use among themselves and go with that
If I had to adress a total stranger i'd probably use spanish first, but idk why sometimes you can just tell if they're from here
Sounds complicated explained like this but in reality i just go with the flow and what the other person prefers
I'd say the majority of catalan speakers are bilingual, so yes :)
It's hard to say
The tendency of the last decades is bad, fewer speakers each year, but current government in Asturias supports some kind of "officialization" and making it compulsatory in schools and public administration
I personally have mixed feelings about it, I want it to survive but not forcing people to it
One big issue is Asturias is a montainous place and the language varies a lot from one valley to the other, in just 150 km we have 5 or 6 "local variants" with their own vocabulary and accent
I am from central Asturias and for me western Asturian sounds almost as Galego, while easter one sounds somehow like Old Castilian
We also have accents in local places as Siero, Langreo or Mieres, and in other places outside Asturias as Laciana or Bierzo (Leonés)
The thing is they have "unified" the language, it is used a lot in local TV but sounds really fake and forced for us traditional speakers
It's very strange to hear (posh) people from Oviedo using it in that strange mixed way and almost telling the rest of us how to speak it properly, it's a non sense
But I guess that is better than than just let it die
Edit: spelling
They are fairly similar (partly due to both being part of the Western Iberian Romance family, and partly because of centuries of contact and imposition of Spanish over Galician has made the latter adopt some Spanish vocabulary), though Galician is closer to Portuguese (given that they both come from medieval Galaico-Portuguese), to the point that some linguists argue that Galician is actually a dialect of Portuguese (or Portuguese a dialect of Galician :P)
Depends
My mother is non-basqur and speaks Basque, but because she is a public employee and he gets bonuses for speaking Basque
But most people non-basque people won't learn it unless for professional reasons
Differently to catalonian, which is very easy to learn for a Spanish speaking people as both are very close language, Basque is completely different to Spanish, so it's difficult to learn
Yeah, my mother speaks Spanish and learned Portuguese and she understands almost perfectly oral Galician
We had some cool languages here in the south
In adittion to Andalusí Arabic we had "mozarabic", the language descendant of latin spoken by christians that lived in Al-Andalus
Both language died centuries ago, but at least they left some substratum in Andalusian Spanish
Totally right
I know morocco is one of the most moderate when it comes to Shariah Law, and that for the most part, north africa is much safer than latinamerica or even north america in some cases
I also know Egypt is the most populated arab country
and that some parts of north africa arent as dry as people tend to think, and seem similar to southern spain
Well on Spain we study the geography and a bit of history, specially about the Muslim occupation (I'm not sure if it's the right word), its contributions to our culture and the "Reconquista" when the Catholic Kings conquered the land back
Lately, there is some beligerant take on it, specially on Morocco, since they seem to test the limit of our borders (Moroccan army claiming more land and defying Canary Islands water jurisdiction)
Also there was a scandal about arabs saying something about conquering Iberian Peninsula again and Spaniards didn't like that a bit, so it boosted a bit the far-right movement
The average spaniard doesn't dislike northern africa, some of them go there on holidays, but honestly we don't know much about you apart from international media
Even though we're literally 14 Km away, we know fuck all about them, except for Morocco
Sometimes we even forget which one's the country next to it, Algeria, which is ridiculous considering it's literally across our south eastern edge
I know absolutely nothing of Algeria, other than France has many immigrants from there
In fact, I'm not too confident the average Spaniard could even tell you the name of the country
All we know is Morocco
We do have tight relationships from Morocco and many of us like to travel there, some to buy cheap immitation/counterfeit goods, usually clothes
We also know them for their crafts, like leather, fabrics, tiles, lamps, carpets
and some people appreciate and buy them
The cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which I remind you, are in North Africa, have extremely close ties with Morocco since it's literally on their doorstep and half or over half of the population is of Moroccan origin
The most common last name in them is Mohammed, so go figure
Other than that, we don't really have close contact with them other than what comes up in the international news or some issue about our countries' trade relationships or whatever
And well, there's a decent population of Moroccan immigrants: they usually run bazars (convenience stores) and many teenagers and young adults, along with South Saharan immigrants (actually they're usually the majority), come in pateras (small boats) smuggled in by mafias across the strait which is usually a very dangerous journey
Also, frequently we have waves of immigrants rushing over Ceuta's or Melilla's fence (yes, we have a "wall", like Trump's) or even through the main control points
Usually this involves a clash with police and people get hurt
Sometimes they get through, sometimes they don't.
We also have a huge issue with drug smugglers crossing from their side to our side, many drug dealers are of Moroccan origin (for obvious geographical reasons) and there's a bit of a debate on whether Morocco is "letting" them cross
I've heard they're pretty tough on drug control, but also that their police force is more prone to corruption, so mafias just bribe them to let them smuggle (drugs or people) over to Spain
All hash comes from there, everybody knows it
We've also had "armed" conflicts with Morocco on territorial disputes, mainly the [Perejil Island incident] but it's always pretty much meaningless clashes
I think fishing disputes as well
Oh, also, a lot of food comes from Morocco, like vegetable, melons, fish, shrimps
For me based on my experience, people from Morroco (specially berbers) are quite nice
I spend 9 days in the country and had a good experience
I know nothing about Algeria except for one taxi driver in Belgium that explained me how corrupt was the government
Tunisia is weird for me
I always wanted to visit it
I love its history and its supposed to be the best democracy in the region
However (I don't want to generalise, take this with a grain of salt) either on the news or on TV shows, they are always mentioned as problematic
Almost like it's stereotypical
I know mostly about Morocco, specially about their culture and story, not that much about the current politics
There's a lot of Moroccans here
We share a lot of story and even a land frontier, I guess that we're probably the European country that knows more about Maghreb
I know just the history that concern my country or my interest
Especially the things abaut moroco becouse what has affect them has affect us specially during the "Reconquista" and also the time in wich Spain had colonies in Africa and how Moroco retake the Spanish sahara and we give near all of north moroco (except Ceuta and Melilla)
I've been a couple of times to Morocco and our histories were intertwined for a long time, so I know a bit about their country's history and general nowadays affairs
Especially those that include Spain in some manner
Algeria is in contrast way more exotic
I know we had historic presence there, but very little more
I've heard about the Algerian war for independence against France, how France thought of Algeria as a part of France itself, and how that was very problematic afterwards
Lybia is uncharted territory, I know they're on a (triple
) civil war, that the French are in and that it used to be an Italian colony
Tunisia, I've been there, but sincerely I know very little about
I know Cartago was based there, I know they have one of the most moderate Islamic parties in the world
I know they were a French colony and
little more
Egypt I know a bit more, basically because of its importance in world history
So as you can see, the more eastern the less I know about
It also applies in the southern direction
I know next to nothing about Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan
Yeah, I may add Portugal
However I think France and Spain really take the cake
France because of the colonies and us because we still have a border with them+ we have a lot of history with Morocco
I think Spain, especially the south is quite connected with the north of Africa, mostly Morroco
We share a lot of gastronomy, culture, a lot of Morrocan and Sahara people lives in Spain
I know a lot of people that have been on holidays in Morroco or Tunisia and has to discover the country (not all-inclusive resorts)
Politically we all know how our Monarchy has always had a good relationship with Morrocan monarchy, so I would say most of Spaniards known at least that Morroco is a Monarchy, that Sahara is in conflict with Morroco and was once part of Spain
Lately I have noticed news about their armies and the danger some countries represent to us
I guess it's just political propaganda but I think there is an increasing tension /fear
We also know the "Reconquista" mostly forced people to convert to Christianity but they kept living in Spain so in fact our cultural and genetical roots are bond
Algeria is known as the country where our natural gas comes from lol
We used to own Oran, and there was a small Spanish colony in Algeria in the French administration era
Francoist Spain hid some OAS prosecuted terrorists
>Also you can find runic inscriptions in Hagia Sofia, Istanbul
I've seen them, I have to say it's cool af
Only improved upon by the fact that dandolo is somehow buried in the church, which I don't understand in any measure
And to think that more than half of Spain was a Caliphate for a 700 years
Edit: making up dates
[On African Romance]
>Spain so in fact our cultural and genetical roots are bond
Not really, when the moors were expelled they were expelled for real
The 800 years of ocuparion by the moors left no genetical traces in Spain
>The genetic data revealed that no significant African component remained in the genetic legacy of the population of the southern Iberian Peninsula compared to other Iberian and European populations, despite North African people living in the region for almost 800 years
The people with most north african DNA are the Galicians
Well, I'm not an expert in History nor genetics, I said what I said because it's what I have studied and because I know and I've seen lot of people that look alike North African people
Anyway, about the links you posted, the genetic study from Nature is focused in 146 people from Granada, Malaga, and Almeria, I wouldn't say it's a large abnd mixed enough measure but anyway the same article says there is a 8%-10% North African genetic influence in the south and around 20% in the north, I wouldn't say they were expelled, that's a lot of people and there were people too when they invaded the peninsula so, again, a lot of people mixed, they weren't replaced
About the ABC article, well, we all know that newspaper and its ideology so I expect it to be biased
The article talks about another study with another results from the previous genetic study
It says Galicia has the higher similarity with North Africans with an 11%, quite different from the other article's 20%.
I also don't understand why the newspaper talks about it in an amazed way, I mean, I have friends from Galicia and they look like North Africans, as their families and people from their villages
I only trust science, I don't trust biased articles or faulty studies so I don't think those 2 articles are enough to affirm they were expelled in the Reconquista, at least not all of them
Lol, it seems people do not like scientific (and objetive) papers
Well it makes sense that the genetic variation would be east to west because of the reconquista
We even have the same evidence with language, but somehow I didn't expect it
That out of Cadiz, Málaga and Asturias the closest ones are Asturias and Cadiz just seems so weird
That qualifies France as "north african empire"
146 people, and start going back in time 500 years
1 person has 2 parents, 4 grandfathers, 16 great fathers, etc
it may look small but they have hundreds and thousands of ancestors
And is Nature, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world
The other, is also a scientific study, the newspaper ideology is not relevant neither
I for one do
I was about to say the exact same
It's a common misconception that iberia and the Maghreb share much ancestry
when in fact they don't.
Well, it's usually told that the expulsion was either christian propaganda or temporal since people previously expulsed returned and just lied about their origins
Well, today science says they werevreally expelled and didn't returned
Yes but can't be sure their ancestors are from Granada or Almería, so they aren't relevant
Nature is prestigious and I don't doubt it's true what it says, I'm just saying it's just an study that we can't extrapolate to the whole country
The ideology is important as the writer interpretation of the data may be biased
10% of genetic similarity is a lot
Is too little
What's to be expected
What about other countries
The writer interprets it as little while 1 in ten people has root with North Africa is not a small number
Also Nature's article doubles the quantity from the one from Oxford so it seem there isn't enough data to get to any conclusion
So a north african empire colonized Indochina
> 10% of genetic similarity is a lot
Is too little
Is not higher compared to other european countries
>What's to be expected
Well, since they lived here for 800 it was logical to asume it would be way more, as they also say
also
> We are aware that 146 individuals is a small sample size for 3 provinces
Reduced sample sizes in population and evolutionary studies may underscore the allelic frequencies of certain alleles, underestimating the number of alleles that aredetected33,34
However, studies that have compared different samples sizes have revealed that, after increasing sample size, newly detected alleles are rare34
In this case, nearly all alleles represented in the allelic ladder are represented in the population and all alleles have frequencies that are similar to those in nearby populations
A bigger samble won't change the study much others studiess (referenced) say, when it comes to genetics
The Independence War (against Napoleon)
It was guerrilla warfare so it kinda makes sense, it would be like that one Assassins Creed game set in the 13 colonies
A game set in Al-Andalus or reconquista period in general would be cool too
If I didn't say the expansion and unification of the early Andalusian Caliphate by Abd Al Raman the 1st (who, remember, survived a coup that killed his entire royal family and crossed a continent until he reached the farthest tip of his empire, reclaimed it and helped it become one of the most advanced kingdoms of Europe), I would be wrong
Edit: emirate
It wouldn't become a full-fledged caliphate until 2 centuries later
- 1750 or 1810 Cadiz (colonies trade monopoly/Peninsular War)
- 1550 Seville (colonies trade monopoly)
- 1000 AD Cordoba (Just before Caliphate's fall)
- 1917 Barcelona or Madrid (general strikes)
Also Havana or Manila 1895 (independence movements before Spanish-American War) could be good
For Spain i'd say the middle ages, when christians, jews and moors lived alongside each other, it would be fun to see the different architecture styles in the different neighbourhoods
Other than that maybe Al-Andalus or el Califato de Córdoba would be rad
- Second punic war and Roman invasion (we would be the good guys)
- El Cid related era (medieval Spain and reconquista, really interesting period)
No good or bad guys
- Conquest of América
Bad guys
- Empire or Charles V and/Philip II and their infinite wars, could be centered on the Netherlands (we would be the bad guys)
- War of Spanish succesion
No good or bad guys
- Spanish Independece War against Napoleon
Good guys
There's a lot of obvious answers, la Reconquista during middle ages, the independence of the American colonies or other colonial periods in america, africa or asia, etc
But I'll love an Assasins Creed about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Anarquist Assassin's vs fascist (and maybe some communist) Templars
It would be great, but it's to recent and political to be a reality, they just don't want to mess with this kind of XX century stuff, unless it's WW2 or Cold War, then it's ok because the Nazis/Russians are always the baddies
1936 Spanish civil war
Endless memes would come from that and lots of juicy posts on r/spain

I though they meant chonis and canis but paletos makes more sense
I'm from "rural" Spain and we sometimes call the urbanites paletos because they have no idea how life is "out here".
The word that is equivalent to British Chav is cani or choni
Paleto is a different story
Example:
Yes, but a chav and a gopnik is nothing like a redneck or a paleto, and a lot like a cani
Well, chungo is an adjective, "un barrio chungo" is a dangerous neighborhood, "un tio chungo" is a dangerous guy
We went on a day trip to a little village with the school when we were like 12 and a friend said: "look guys, a cow
Like the ones in the book" hahah
Andalusia is very, VERY rural and it's a region famous for its low education rates but andalusia is not a word we use to offend anyone
In the 70s, "melodic music" like Italy (Nino Bravo comes to mind), rumba vallecana (flamenco+Cuban rumba, descending from Catalan rumba which was popular in the 60s. It shares topics with trap and rap, like poverty and . Los Chichos, Los Chunguitos) and some rock-pop too (Los Pecos)
In the 80s, the Movida Madrileña will rise up inspired from British new wave (Mecano, Alaska, Radio Futura, Los Secretos, Nacha Pop
) and rock (Hombres G, Loquillo
I would say glam-rock/synth-pop here in Spain
La Movida was the only artistic movement created in Spain in the 20th century, a a explosion of talent repressed during the dictatorship and released after Franco's death in the Transition
It was specially remarkable in the music area
I can have a normal conversation with Portuguese, however i do not understand the Italians
I'm fluent in English and Spanish so:
Italian: if you speak a bit slower I can pick up on 85% of what you're saying, reading is also not too bad
Portuguese: I can understand it less than Italian, but I can pick up on every other sentence (ish), reading in Portuguese is slightly easier than Italian
French: Spanish only really helps with the odd word, it's actually the French I was taught in school that helps me more
Spanish here
I can understand very well the Portuguese, Italian and Catalan
The French is different, I can understand some words but I can't have a fluent conversation as I can have with Italians and Portugueses
I've been in Italy and Portugal and I have had short conversations speaking in spanish and they answering me in italian and portugese
It was easier with italian than with portuguese but we still made it work
With french is absolutely impossible, I can only understand it a little bit when is written
Portuguese: I can understand completely written Portuguese, I can barely understand a 35% of spoken Portuguese
Italian: I can understand 65% of written Italian, I can understand a 50% of spoken Italian
French: 40% Written, 20% Spoken
Catalan: 50% Written, 25% Spoken
Romanian: I can't understand nothing of it
It seems weird
I think I will understand even more of Dutch, probably because my knowledge of English
Written, pretty well
Spoken, not so much
Portuguese: I can understand it with 0 problems, im from Galicia which helps a lot
Italian: 50/50 or less
French: I dont even bother to understand It, a whole another world
I can understand Portuguese and Italian if they are written
The pronunciation is very different
Italian: written 80%, oral 60%
Portuguese: written 85% oral 50%
Catalan (with some exposure): written 95% oral 75%
Galician (with some exposure): written 95% oral 60%
Romanian: written 50% oral 40%
French: I speak it, otherwise I think written 50% oral 30%
I'm a translator, so I may not be the average observer
I can translate from Galician and Catalan pretty confidently despite having no training in those languages
What
Is all the opposite for me
Catalan is very similar to spanish
Most people from don't have trouble understanding it
When I hear Portuguese I don't understand it that much
But written I can get everything
In Italian is the same, although I understand them a bit more
Idk which one is closer, I guess it must be Portuguese
Italian didn't get the influence Arab gave us during their 800 years occupation
I can understand a lot of Brazilian Portuguese
But Iberian Portuguese is a lot harder to understand despite me being from Spain
the   [Garrote] a strangling device
Disease
Bullets
in the spring of 1936 alone there was over 300 politics-related assassinations
Fusilation
A good old balcony
We set them up strategically to kill our targets and it's mostly effective
You build them and then you just have to wait until the victim becomes British, young, drunk/drugged and happens to run towards it and jump *accidentally* in the general direction of a pool
It's a masterpiece
And balconing nowadays
too soon
Well that’s positively unpleasant
after the civil war it was used very few times but yeah it was there
I mean, they don’t *have* to be complete idiots on balconies
It’s more like an “unplanned unmanned assisted suicide device”, or UUAS device for short :)
“Smartest”
Europeans can't hurt you

Now sleep, my ChILd, slEeP
For Spain It depends on the region as Spanish is not the only official language
In Valencia for example school is in both Spanish and Catalan (% depends on school but 40-60 more or less)
For English our region once introduced a plan to have all public schools make the 3 language system
1/3 of all classes in Spanish, 1/3 Catalan and 1/3 English
It horribly failed because the English level of teachers was/is not good enough for teaching subjects in it
And that pretty much translates to all of Spain
Bilingual schools in foreign languages are mostly only private and more of the higher end of pay
Legally all people learn spanish and english, in zone where there is another official language, it varies, but they tend to know the regional language
But for english let's say not that much people can use it fluently
We have classes in Spanish and valencian
Each year we used to change the language of some subjects
Which was a bad idea as in subjects like biology I knew half the names of stuff in valencian and the other half in Spanish
We have English at school but it's a joke
Some places have French or German but it tends to be not compulsory so the people that choose them are more motivated and the teachers are good
I think there are many highschools that want to transition into a bilingual education but they are not ready to do it
As you said, the level of English is pretty bad in teachers
But I live in Madrid and many people i know have studied in a bilingual highschool
I studied in a bilingual school but I didn't do English, I did French (about 50% of my classe were in French) which is not as common
So introducing english is an "attack". Great
Heh
I don't know what's that
_sweats nervously_
Hello there, if we talk about them existing, out of the 17 regions we have at least 4 have a noticeable separatist movement, Catalonia, Basque country, Galicia, and maybe Andalusia and Valencian community or baleares have a very small one
But I think currently none of these movements are viable, at least in the moment as around 50% of local population supports literal independence in the strongest movement, we will see in the future tho, it's a daily topic in Spain, as we say only Spain can destroy herself
We have a weirdly large amount, but Catalonia is the one that most people have heard of
And honestly, I don’t think they’re going to be able to gain their independence any time soon
The two big ones are Catalonia and the Basque Country, with smaller ones in basically every autonomous community
Support for both of the large ones is under 50% in each of their respective regions, but it's close, so in a decade or a few we might see either of them or both becoming independent
well from what i can gather catalonyan independentists are pro-europe but europe doesnt want unstability and having even more countries to manage, plus for EU to position themselves supporting any independence movement would undermine the unity that EU seeks and most importantly, the country where that independentist movement is from would lose all trust in the EU
2, Basque country and Catalonia, They wouln't join the EU
Literally every autonomous community in Spain has separatist movements
It's quite complex, they come in all types of shapes and colours
Basque country has a movement
It used to be backed by ETA (aka terrorists) but now it's peaceful and not as strong anymore, I think
Even Andalucía has its own (very little, mostly unknown) independence movement
Yes, we do, I voted for them nor because I want independence from Spain, it's just how this country work, you have to make noise to be listened by madrid
They do, but it's not very strong
The Catalan one is the strongest now, then the Basque
The rest follow at a considerable distance
> their own economy, wich would be bigger and better if they didn't divide it with Spain
This reason makes no sense
Every country has a richer region that would be better off if it didn't have to send taxes to the poorer regions
At least theoretically, because once you factor in how things like trade would affect the economy, it's not so clear, but let's ignore that for the sake of argument
There are many self-identified leftists that support the rich paying more taxes yet don't want Catalonia to pay taxes to Extremadura
I think that's clearly a contradiction
I'm not sure if that your case, of course
In general, I'm in favour of them getting independence if they so desire, but not at any cost
It must be carefully planned and agreed upon, otherwise we would end up with brexit times ten levels of shitshow
But I think it benefits no one, all aspects of Catalonian culture are respected and promoted nowadays, independence wouldn't affect that whatsoever, and I think it's pretty stupid, in this day and age, to go around creating new borders and amplifying our differences instead of getting together and cooperate
It's not a problem to you but you also have Catalan independentism in your territory
>Abkhazia, on the other hand, was probably supposed to be a premier Black Sea tourism spot as it once was during USSR
That moment when you support a breakaway state in order to get some nice beach front
*Looks worringly to Germany and the Balearic Islands
I mean, all I said was that it used to be backed by ETA, which is true
Not that it was originated by ETA or that ETA was all there is to it
But your comment was far more informative than mine, so thank you for that
You wouldn't believe the amount of propaganda Spanish nationalism has put into linking both, and how well it's worked
He meant peaceful
Pacífico in Spanish -> Peaceful in English but mistaken with Pacific because of the similarity
> So and what about Spain joining Portugal under the Portuguese government, would you like that
Under a government that functioned like the Spanish government does
Sure, it wouldn't be a Portuguese government anymore, though, it would be an Iberian government, because Spain recognized different nationalities in the Constitution and said nationalities have great autonomy
Everyone does, Spain is de facto a federal state
> Are you sure
The Catalans voted for Carles Puigdemont and he was forced to step down, and that is happening again with Quim Torra, but he is refusing to step down, isn't that oppression
He was forced to step down because he made illegal things
There are plenty of separatists, many much more radical than Puidgemont, in several parliaments of Spain, including the national parliament
> And image if France annexed Spain, would you like to pay taxes to them
France is generally richer than Spain, but if there is a region that needs it, I already do through the European Union
And yes, I'd be in favour of expanding that
Same as with Portugal, if the government respects the culture of the minorities and it's not a situation of repression or dominance, I'm all for it
> Spain annexed Catalonia, Catalonia off course doesn't want to pay anything to they invaders and oppressors
Spain did not annex Catalonia
The Crowns of Castile and Aragon entered a personal union and, over time, merged into the same country, called Spain, that has gone through a lot of different governments and ideologies
The "Kingdom of Catalonia and Aragon" never existed, it was the "Crown of Aragon", which included a lot of feudal entities, including the Kingdom of Aragon, the County of Barcelona or the Kingdom of Valencia
Personal unions aren't annexations, far from it
Indeed, the crowns were merged in the 18th century
The Catalans were not sllightly more oppressed under Franco, they were very oppressed, and they aren't know
> Name them
He only did a referendum to see what the people want
So, he used public resources to do something that was outside his powers
That doesn't sound very legal to me
I'm not going to pretend that Madrid's management of the issue hasn't been a shitshow, but separatists are no different, especially PDC, which seems to be willing to throw the rest of us under the proverbial fascist bus if it befits them
ERC is showing that at least they care about the bigger picture and for that they have my respect
> He used Catalan resources to show something most Catalans wanted to be shown, he only made what the people wanted
And if the people wanted to crack down on separatist leaders
I don't think a PP, for example, leader of Catalonia should be able to ban the use of Catalan, through referendum or not
Laws are there to protect the rights of everyone, you can't ignore them just because you feel that more or less the majority of the population wants something
Yeah, laws can change
But not because the executive power wills so, laws have to be changed by the legislative power under their own rules
The Catalan parliament needs a 2/3 majority to change the Statute of Autonomy, it doesn't make any sense to attempt to declare independence when they can't even change that according to their own rules
That depends on what you consider upgrade or downgrade, but in any case that's irrlevant to my point
"Raven" and "crow", we only have "cuervo".
On the other hand, we have "buho" and "lechuza" where they only have "owl"
Wife and handcuffs are both esposa
Yeah, I find this difference pretty annoying in both cases
Also, "cake" and "pie" are both "tarta".
Existe también ponzoña. Aunque es una palabra ya antigua y en desuso (o eso creo)
Phonetics don't help
Is the book read or red
Correct
We do use prefixes to refer to this daytime nouns to avoid confusion, as in english
Example: if you want to say you'll do or have done something in the morning, it's "por la mañana" (during the morning), "esta mañana" (this morning), or soneyying similar
If you want to talk about tomorrow you just say it as a self explaining noun: "Lo haré+mañana" (I'll do it+tomorrow)
Do you have separate words for hunting birds like eaqle, different falcons too
If they dark and look similar, they are cuervos
I checked and it's a word used in Mexico for some owls
Don't remember hearing of it before
However is normal, they have a lot of vocabulary different from the spanish of Spain, like saltamontes and chapulin
TIL
Never have heard corneja before, thanks for the info
This is where the fun begins
Brits must be a bit confused about the gifts you give
In Spanish novio/novia can mean just going out formally (usually) to how you are right before you're officially married
So it can be a casual teen relation, or a fully developed couple right before marriage with 10 years of relation on their backs
Ditto spain
We need Romania and Portugal to confirm Latin languages agree
I know
I meant that it sounded like the basic colour, and looked like the other tense
Why create this confusion
Note that spanish is bad at this too , I'm not saying English is worse
Falconiformes (look like falcons) include those 3 words too: Águila, Halcón, and Buitre respectively
Plus many native ones and the names are more often about size than about actual evolution paths
>This is for me a mantra
I've heard so many times that thing about people learning languages only through video games or partly through video games
It does not work like that
Sure, you might have become better at it, learnt many words and idioms, your pronunciation and listening skills might have gotten better
But in order for you to improve in those areas effectively you need to study the basis of the language and get a proper immersion
Grammar books, classes, traveling, language exchanges and a years of practice
Had you not done that before playing games, you would not have been able to understand a thing
You won't become proficient with it either
>Learning through video games, music and media is just a ressource, a bit of help, but not a proper method
That being said I'm glad it has helped you that much
I identify with my city when I'm in another city of the same region, and I identify with my region when I'm in another region of Spain, if that makes any sense
I once heard a quote of someone along those lines, but I couldn't remember it
My region
The basque region is very different from the rest of Spain
My nation
I love the city were I was born and raised (Valencia) but my parents and grandparents are from all over Spain
So we never spoke valencian even tho we understand it, we never liked Fallas too much or never fell super tied to any valencian traditions other than paella for lunch on saturdays
My city always comes first
I have a deep sense of belonging to my land, the Mediterranean sea, my language and my culture
I consider myself a Spaniard too, but the truth is that there are so many different cultures and traditions in Spain that I can't feel a connection with the whole country, I don't think I know my country as well as to consider all of it a part of me
I'd say I'm Asturian, then European, then Spanish, but I identify as all three
City and region over country all the way
I can hardly identify as a Spaniard, although there's an undeniable strong cultural tie
But even in the event of considering Catalonia a nation, I still identify more deeply with my city and region
In this order:
Granada (city/province)
Spanish (Country)
Andalusian (region)
European
Mostly castillian but as that includes la mancha i would say that im from Valladolid then from spain then from a spanish talking country then from southern europe and then from europe, then as a member of the human specie fuck that alien
Most of the times I identify as Galician
Unless I'm not in Spain, in that case I'll identify as Spaniard, but if they ask where in Spain then I'll identify as Galician again lol
Edit: and if I am in a visiting a different city or town in Galicia, I'll just identify as being from my city
As being Galician in Galicia is kind of redundant, same way as being Spaniard in Spain is xd
It's funny that in my experience depending on what region a person is from they'll identify with their region or with the province/city in the region
For example I've heard many times "I'm from Galicia" (region) but you'll never hear anybody from Andalucía (region) say they're from Andalucía, they'll always say the province
Same with the Canary or Balearic islands, they'll usually say what specific island they're from
I still haven't quite gotten which regions favor which response and it obviously depends on the person but it's something I've noticed
Overall however I'd say people tend to answer with the province rather than the region
And the city if they're from a capital or major one
As a Spanish, is something like that
Barcelona and Girona usually don't have any good relationship, unless there comes Aragon to talk about borders, vall d'Aran, stolen sacred art during the war on yr
1036-9 and so on
Then they show the shield wall
Later on, they are again argueing
Huge regions will favor province over small or uniprovincial regions
Andalucía and the 2 Castillas are huge, so they will just say Toledo or Granada instead
Adding up to this, you won't hear a guy from Ponferrada say they're from León, so it gets even more complicated when "shire\* identity" comes into play
\* (for lack of a better translation to Comarca)
in a lot of countries is usually all against the capital (then all against all)
i find that in castilla and leon the ones that tend to say castilla are the one from the "capital" valladolid the rest no, special mention to Leon
I've found the "opposite" in the Canary Islands IME
They will remark they're Canarian first and later the island they come from
It might have to do with the fact that many people outside the archipielago don't really have a mental image for every single island, unless it's Gran Canaria or Tenerife, who usually say "Tenerife" or "Las Palmas".
i would translate county as condado wich is not exactly the same at least in my view
A family friend had a very nice house in a village nearby
It was on a very tall mountain and we went every Sunday to BBQ (Argentinian family lol) and hike
I loved those hikes and the dogs that man had
He had a car accident a few years back and passed away, I still think of him
I loved drawing, playing on my brand new pink DSLite and playing with my cat, Emi
She's a grown up cat now and very healthy, for those concerned about cats dying on this comment
For extracurriculars, I did English and swimming, I did martial arts too
I read a lot and my dad was always buying me new books that I started reading as soon as we left the bookshop and were all read the day after
When summer came I'd go to the beach everyday and swim and build sand castles
I loved watching movies with my parents, who never hesitated to watch the appropriate "grown-up" stuff with me
We also built puzzles, my favorite puzzle is a Klimt painting that is now framed in my bedroom
I also went for walks with my mom around town (a beautiful seaside Catalan town) and played around with my friends
Once a month we made it a point to go to Barcelona and have Starbucks and walk around and go shopping or to museums or art exhibits
I had an awesome childhood
I used to play with my toys at home on my own
Also watched some TV but not a lot, nor being a fan of any TV series
Growing up in South Africa, my favourite game was called ‘kleilat’.
Basically, we’d head to the local stream where there was a good clay bank and willow trees
You’d get a nice long piece of willow, a handful of clay then got added to the end and you’d launch it at someone on the opposite bank
Ended up with loads of bruises but it was great fun
"Queue" not because is hard but because I never remember how is pronounced
&#x200B;
also words with b/v. In Spanish they are pronounced the same (even when latin was the language of the peninsula, "Beati Hispani quibus vivere bibere est". Lucky Spanish for whom living is drinking)
Literature
Sometimes that word just feels like a tongue twister to pronounce
Edit: and if I try to pronounce it several times in a row, it just becomes a weird amalgamation of a non sensical mess of weird sounding sylabells
"Collaborativelly". I need to look at a fixed point and concentrate to say it well on my first try
As a result, most times I say it well but I look quite dramatic
For me the impossible one is "definitely"
I see 5 syllables but I'm supposed to say it in just 2 or 3
Impossible to my mind
There's no English sounds I particularily struggle with, and I'd say my pronunciation of words in general is decent (although there's surely a ton of words I mispronounce even slightly because English pronunciation is weird)
But what I really struggle with when speaking is vowels in general
It's not that I can't pronounce them, but I'm used to have only 5 vowel sounds like in Spanish, and I just confuse them relatively often
For instance, say I'm trying to pronounce "cup" and I might pronounce it like "cap", usually I just realize instantly and say the word again correctly
It's just something I notice I do quite often when speaking with my non-Spanish friends
Those are difficult for me because they are the same words in Spanish and my mind goes to the default set up
Sometimes they sound the same for me  when spoken fast
Worcestershire Sauce
"Gewfwend", "lichualy" and "weldwide" are waaaaaay easier for me to spell
People think that coming from a country in which we roll our Rs it would be easier for us to spell these words, but our Rs are never surrounded by other consonants and then followed by even more Rs
You just taught me how to say it
Nah, in Spanish is easy, ardilla
&#x200B;
Kiwi (not kibi, please, dont be my yaya)
For me it's not about the words itself, it is more about similar words: cup, cap; Beer, bear, beard, bird, bare (...)
I just say "line".
I have internalized the v sound and I have no problem with now, I did when I started speaking English
However I still have problems with the vowels when they are not the Spanish sounds like in bus or focus, those are “a” sound but holy molly I get weird a’s.
Also the y and ll sounds
pfff
li cher chuer
Aprox
Rural rur
ok I see what you did there
My English friends usually struggle with the Spanish words: piscina and fascismo
Apparently the s and th sound together are tricky
Yeah, but my brain keep saying "there are too many vowels to be just Q"
Exactly hahaha It's the ch sound that makes it hard
In school are thought British English, so I'm much more familiar with the English accent than the American one
I honestly like the pronounciation a lot (my favorite accents are Australian and English)
It's just that when I say it, sometimes it just feels like I'm having a stroke lol
I love the non pronounciation of "r" in English
It's pretty much the reason why Australian is my favorite accent
It makes pronouncing some words much more easier
Like those last two words, you just make the "o" in "more" longer and forget about "re", and the "ie" longer and forget about the "r" in "easier".
I have lived in the UK and honestly, the people who go out just to get pissed are more than in other places
It's the same people who then go to Spain and do exactly the same tbh
I haven't find this kind of people in such large numbers in other European countries, maybe in Eastern Europe
I was thinking in Russia mostly but I'm not sure either, that's why I said maybe
It makes sense then if it happens inside your home you won't have this kind of conflicts
Argentina, maybe it is quite obvious but our society and theirs share common problems, mentality and way of life
Montenegro and Andalucía both have a reputation of being lazy and be all day sleeping, so there is that
But Im myself im castillian and i don't really know with what compare it
My hometown was sometimes called spanish finland because its cold as fuck and we get good school grades but that's all
I keep getting surprised by how similar Cuba is when compared to other Latin American countries
From spellings to attitudes and ways of life
It cannot be the extra 100 years of colony because Puerto Rico feels more different, and the Philippines may be other planet
You'd think being semi-locked away after a communist revolution and a economic blockade would change that but
nope
I wonder if it's exactly that
They got rid of obscenely high/colonial legacy wealth disparity, and had the same slide from omnipresent Catholicism to apathetic Atheism as us while avoiding the Evangelical surge elsewhere in Latin America
Also while they have their anticolonial and independence heroes they aren't as anal and in-your-face hispanophobes as others can be
I am from Spain and I said exactly that when I visited Australia
This is true
>I can bet that people in Spain still vote depending on whether their ancestors were republican or monarchist
You would win that bet, 100% true
You don't know if your granfather was republican because they haven't foubd the body yet
Well, to an untrained ear, Portuguese can sound Russian
I'm going to say the [Cíes Islands] I've gone there a couple of times, one of my favourite places
[The beach of Rodas] in there was chosen by the Guardian in 2007 as the best in the world
As for unic I would say it's between [la pedriza] [Guadarrama mountain range national park] or [the beech forest of montejo]
The first is basically what it means, bundle of rocks
It's the one of the largest granitic ranges in europe
I used to live near
in my town there was a rock the size of a house no one had cared (or could afford) to move
The second looks like any mountain range but due to its altitude isolation (a mountain range separating two plateaus) it has plenty of endemisms and rare species
There's 1680 species in the park, many of which are normally found at higher latitudes
The third might look unimpressive if you come from central Europe but that's one of the southernmost beech forests in Europe and the world
Just 4° north of the world record holder in Sicily
And tbh beech forest are **glorious** in autumn
That's absolutely stunning
Reminds me a bit of Cuenca's "[Haunted City] (don't get too excited, it's just weird rocks)
I went there a few years ago and hiked up to the top where you could see the lighthouse
Absolutely stunning
I was surprised how white and powdery the sand was on the beaches
A good friend of mine lives in a small town on the coast up there (Bueu) and we’ve taken his dad’s boat and circled the islands a few times as well
Man, Galicia is a special place, can’t wait till I can go again
I thought they were called spaghetti westerns  when they were shot in Italy and chorizo westerns when they were shot in Spain
Shhh, we're trying to cheer him/her up
I have the exact same classes and at the same hour except for one subjet where the teacher is just sending powerpoints with his voice
My university has an special app for them to use integrated in the online classroom we already had
I dont kniw what is that zoom app
We only use skpe and google meet
High school here, we do about 5 weekly hours of video class, usually with zoom, google meet or Jitsi Meet
We also get about 15h of weekly homework to do, but in my school we haven't got many homework
I’m in highscool in Spain, we only use google meet, google classroom, google drive and so on
It works fine and it’s included in the G suite fee
The only issue I’ve had is that it didn’t have a grid view feature, it needed a chrome extension
I think it does include it now tho
Discord and Google Classroom
Discord because it's free and everyone had it already, and with the text channels and voice chats came in handy
At the end only like 4 of 25 in class assist to VCs where the teachers explain stuff
You don't have to either anyway really
At the start they tried to enforce it but they quickly stopped because they knew they wouldn't win
Some teachers also tried Google Meet instead of Discord but again, almost nobody joins
Our teachers have been very lax with the lessons, schedules and due times for stuff
They also don't feel like working much, I feel, haha, so it's a win win for everyone
I'm a vocational education teacher and my wife teaches a subject at the Uni
We're both using Meet because of that exact reason
Your wife is a keeper
Since the lockdown began only 2 out of 5 teachers have actually been teaching at my Uni, and we have to do the exams in the same conditions as before
We have:

In Spain we have a bunch of those:
Malcocinados: badly cooked
Seno: an formal way of saying tit
Adiós: bye
Poo: recently renamed to Po without the locals approval
In Galicia they have Villapene (penis village)
I think we won lol
I'd like to add:

The Queen's bathroom
The Queen's pee area
Whatever, you get the idea)
Espera (Wait)

There's also a river called Polla (dick) that flows into river Ebro
Not a village, but I think it's worth mentioning lmao
And Berga
Also Guarromán, the dirty superhero
There's also a city in Asturias called Entrepeñas that in Asturian is called Entrepenes (Between penises)
Just 15 people live there
For us it's probably the [Tenerife Airport Disaster] which is the deadliest aviation accident to date
583 dead, 61 wounded
It's pretty well known, but the summary is that a pilot tried to take off without clearance, hitting an aircraft that was leaving the runway
The [Santiago de Compostela derailment] in 2013 is pretty well known, a train derailed due to it doubling the speed limit
79 people died, 139 were injured
However, that one is far from the worst train accident in Spain, [which was in 1944] when it's estimated 500 people died in a train accident
Exact number isn't known as the Franco regime covered it up (estimations range between 200 and 800)
While it was due to a brake failure, this was due to the very poor maintenance state of the trains, so I think it fits your question as well
That man might be indirectly responsible for WW1, WW2 and all the conflicts surrounding the Cold War lol
The first one that came to mind was a train accident as well, because it was "recent", in 2013: [Santiago de Compostela derailment] 79 people died because the train was at twice the speed on a curve and it was all the driver's fault
I can't imagine the feeling of guilt on the guy but
it *was* his fault
But I think the actual worse accident was the [Los Rodeos airport crash] in 1977, the deadliest accident in aviation ever with 583 deceased
Two planes crashed as they attempted takeoff when the pilot in one of the planes mistakenly thought the landing stop was clear for takeoff when it was not
A Sweden the largest city of the world :)
Well a shade of that happened: he was not sentenced to death but to life in prison and he died only a few weeks before the end of the war in 1918
By that time Serbia was occupied and had lost 1/3 of its population
I think they askdd him how he felt and he said he didn't care
He was depressive and off his medication
Whoever allowed him to fly also fucked up
Besides, he was only the copilot so the entire crisis could have been averted if the pilot had not taken a bathroom break (or, if plane doors had not been made invulnerable in the aftermath of 9/11)
Sweden is the largest CITY of the world (he meant country probably)
Oh, I remember studying that case in my engineering class
By size (extension) will be the larger
Those are just set phrases and idioms, they don't imply a belief anymore
However, people seem to get more religious when they get old, specially women
Fear,  uncertainty, and despair are allies to religion
Not necesarilly
We mostly mourn more in the sense that we're present to help the family of the deceased
Not really, I've never seen someone young talking about this stuff, it's usually older people that gets religious when someone die, but they were already realigios in private
A lot of old people here believe in some kind of god but they never go to church, so the only moment where they talk about it is at a funeral
Why especially women and in what way
In my experience it's kind of been the other way around
The older women I know are more pragmatic and seem to accept that they won't be here much longer
If they were religious before, they continue to be so at the same level
On the other hand, the guys are getting a bit more "anxious" to put it that way, and dialling up their religious sentiment to get over that anxiety
My grandfather has become insufferable (I'm saying this with love) and brings up god and heaven in every conversation, no matter what the conversation is about, lol
It's a crime how underappreciated this show is
I mean
, it's no available for streaming and it's usually a played channel tv show, if at all
Maybe in the US the show is well known but in Spain most have never heard of it
How are you so pale
Don't you guys have the hot weather and the sun shining
Or the, "Paella flamenco toros futbol oleole", and if you're an American with a lack of knowledge on geography, the "taco sombrero cholo"
The most wtf situation happened in the US:
\-And where are you from
\-I'm from Spain
\-But you look caucasian \[confused face\]
I didn't know how to react after a few seconds I said "Well, Spain is part of Europe so I guess it's normal, right
Canada:Is it cold
Spain: is it sunny
The answer to both is yes
The only foreign country I visited is England (London)  people that asked about my nationality were Spanish or had lived in Spain so they just started speaking Spanish
Barca, Barça, FC Barcelona, Messi
Oléeee, paella, toros, flamencoo, fiesta
I've been to Paris
I wouldn't want to live there either
I got that one too
Also from an American
The thing I hate most about myself is that I've got a natural tan
And that means that I look like what people think we look like
So if I ever go abroad, and say that I'm from Spain, people will think that we actually look as tanned as I look
And if that's not enough, half of my family is British
Which makes it all more confusing
Wait, why puta madre
"What
I thought Spain was in Mexico
" after flying for 15 hours to get here
I remember an interview to a spanish soccer player (Albiol) during the Euro 2008
The journalist asked him why would he visit Austria if weren't because of the eurocup
He answered: "To see the kangaroos". Really embarrassing
Eef yee could cheenge yer feet wooja
Why wouldn't you
But that's less than half of all French people right
I had a boss from Paris once and, being Canadian, Quebec came up
He said their accent sounds nasally and whiney and he said something In a mocking voice in French as if to imitate them
I'm from Vancouver so I have no idea what he said
And it was only 1 person, it's not like it happened to me with every american I met, I just said that because I found it funny
To this day I still don't know if he thought that Spain was in latin America or he said that because I have blue/grey eyes and light brown hair and I don't look like the stereotypical spaniard (something like Antonio Banderas, to name one)
Very very rarely, every 10 years or more
Nope
I live in the south
Doesn't snow here
No, and I'm not disappointed or anything cuz, you know, I live in Valencia (Spain) and It would be very very wired if I had a white Christmas
Btw, to day we have had 19 degrees Celsius
Asturias here
It snowed in the mountains, but where I live (200 m altitude) it hasn't yet
Not a single snowflake, and I live in Galicia, the "cold" part of Spain
Like 3 days here in Bratislava, what a shame brat
Reporting from Madrid, 3 days ago or so it snowed in the mountains nearby (Cotos, Sierra de Guadarrama for the Madrileños who read this) as it rained this week
Madrid is 650m above sea level, mountains are like 1000-1500m.
It won't snow here in Madrid anymore, last snow in the city was like 5 years ago at least
It was fairly popular, but today mostly it's relegated to crappy tv channels just because they have the license and some commercial in morning programs for housewives
It's not popular at all, not even with old people
I don't understand where they get the money to exist in 2020
I would like to add we have a problem with TV fortune-tellers, too many stealing money at too many 'innocent' people
I will say this  one
Robert's Capa The Falling  Soldier
We have a lot I can't choose, maybe franco and hitler idk
To add to this, also one of the most iconic photos from the civil war:
[Marina Ginestà on top of the Hotel Colón in Barcelona]
(Note: the Wikipedia article on her is a good read, she was a Republican journalist and translator for a Soviet newspaper's correspondent, and she didn't actually fight per se)
[The first Spanish astronaut should also make it to the list]
Yep
Saw it all over the place when I was in Berlin
Isnt that picture from a movie though
I do not think anyone filmed the real explosion
Idk, it doesn't look the same to me
He did took inspiration from Mussolini, didn't he
And Liechtenstein
As a Spanish I never cared about nationalistic rhetoric but I always wanted Gibraltar to comply with taxes, alcohol and tobacco prices so they could make Schengen a reality for Gibraltar too
Sealand is officially part of Britain and doesn't exist as a recognised sovereign state, tho
I could be listening to Romanian for hours
I like french and the Argentinian variation of my own language
I love Italian
They kinda sing speaking
For women italian, french or spanish with argentinian accent
For men italian
Portuguese and Catalan are two of my favourite latin languages
To me Irish and Quechua are the most beautiful, I can't say why but I love them
I am from the Basque Country and I am very impressed someone so far away played that song to you
That's incredible
Thank you
You may like this group
I find it beautiful the way they sing
[Huntza]
I've always liked [this one] although I understand 0% of what she's singing
For a non-speaker's ears there's not that much difference
Enserio, podría estar escuchando a un argentino/a hablar todo el día sin parar y no me importaría
No te estás enterando campeón. Para ti y para mi obviamente las diferencias son obvias
**Para alguien que no habla nada de español** esas diferencias fonéticas simplemente no son lo suficiente diferentes como para darse cuenta de que son variedades distintas
A ver si leemos bien en vez de salir a la ofensiva a la primera de cambio
No diría italiana, como tal, pero mola mucho jajajaja
Quizás algo canaria a lo mejor
Jajajaja pues puede ser, habría que buscar de dónde viene el acento
Charles V of Germany and I of Spain was more german than spanish
Felipe V duke of Anjou was indeed French
Amadeo I of Savoy wich was elected as monarch when the glorius revolution
Carlos III lived a lot in Naples
In the time of al-andalus some of the caliphs where from Africa especially the almohads or the almoravids
A few times these ones are the ones that come to mind:
Charles I: born in Gante
Philip V: born in France
Joseph Bonaparte: born in Corsica
Amadeo of Savoy: born in Turin
[We've had a prime minister born in the Philipines]
I think Amadeo could had been a good monarch if the spanish allowed him
Savoy was pretty liberal with all of the unification at least as far as i know
I forgot about Charles IV
He came from Naples, right
well also the french and spanish ocupation as well as the austrian one could count
> In the time of al-andalus some of the caliphs where from Africa especially the almohads or the almoravids
But those all ruled from Marrakech
Well the last almoravids ended up in Mallorca (the Banu Ghaniya)
well if i remember righ the Servian monarchy was couped due to their tendency to Austria before ww1
Please correct me if im wrong
well i should had say HRE but in spanish its calle
"Carlos I de España y V de Alemania"
(Charles I of Spain and V of Germany"
im sorry and i apologice
well due to the treaty the king of France cant be also the king of Spain
well excluding the iberian muslim kingdoms i would still consider it as i would consider grece part of the otoman empire when it was under they control and the otomans ruling grece
but its just a point of view
thats a good reason to dont count them honestly
I just say that due to his mention of the "trend" of having german monarch but thats truly interesting
As a spaniard I've taken it as this:
Born in your historic territory: not foreign
Born elsewhere: foreign
Otherwise we would have to enumerate all the kings of Spain and that would be less interesting
Basically, where they considered foreign at the time
that would had cause another war indeed and if the treaty its not valid i want naples back lol
A History teacher in secondary school, 15/16 years old, said in class that the UK betrayed Belgium during WWI
I didn't say anything but I facepalmed heavily
A couple of years before, the Math teacher said that an object standing over something is only stable if the center of gravity is exactly on the same vertical axis as the geometrical baricenter of the base of said object
I said that was not possible, that it was enough for the center of mass to be over the base, not necessarily over the baricenter, or for example a table would tip over as soon as anything is put on it
The teacher did some mental gymnastics to argue his point but there was no way on Earth to convince him
No civilization appeared in warm climates
Just a little correction: it's Crete in English
Correct me like a dumbass teacher if I'm wrong, but I think democracy does absolutely come from Greek: demos (people, folk) and kratos (power)
Power of the people
Do you celebrate the 6th of January
Here (Spain) today is The Three Wise Men's day, día de Reyes
The day prior there is a big parade at night in wich the 3 Kings and their "assistants" trow candy at cildren and as a kid is really fun
At night you leave cookies and a beverage for the Kings and water and vegetables for their camels, and leave yor clean shoes under the tree
The morning of 6th is the day children open their Christmas presents, placed  strategically next to their shoes, family gathers together and we eat Roscón de Reyes- orange blossom water sweet bread/ pastry shaped as a ring decorated with colorful candied fruits and almonds simulating a crown
Inside the baker hides a ceramic figurine or coin that if you find in your portion it is said to bring good luck and a bean that if you find you have to pay the Roscón. It is great and yummy
Father Christmas is slowly gaining terrain, though
Never expected haha so cool
So it's a wich taking part on a christian hollyday
Wow so cool
Yes, here parades weren't a big thing this year due to Covid too
Lol, in Spain it's OK to say it for an additional week as a lot of people is on leave from the office this week
Spanish Christmas season lasts 3 weeks, the week of Xmas (25/12), the week of new year and the week of the kings (6/1)
Most people usually take at least one week off from work and people in some workplaces take turns to not close, but some lucky ones take all three weeks (I.e. Teachers and students mostly)
Well, Santa Claus is finnish after all, so it makes sense
Why just only in some states
Are they traditionally Christian regions
Haha the cheap cardboard crown is a thing here too
Oooh, it seems sad to work in the last day of Christmas :(
Sup neighbor
I freaking love bacalhau à Brás. All bacalhau really
That's a really cool souvenir
So wholesome
How is that possible
Don't you have a pastry called Gallete des Rois
Makes sense haha
Hahaha I don't even know how I know this exists
Spain here
To be honest, nothing comes to my mind
The only time I remember now when I say, "Oh, shit
Here we go again" is when a headline appears saying "Juan Carlos is being investigated for
*P. D.: Why the NHS gets overwhelmed during winters
Flu
The usual news now are: it's very cold outside
In summer: it's very hot outside
I think the classic discussion about the Three Wise Men (The three Kings in Spanish) parades and if Baltazar should be a black man or any black faced guy is ok for the job fits here
Also the former king of Spain birthday is 6th of January, which made that day all about royalty
And it's the beginning of the winter sales, so it's handy to analyse the annual inflation
- It is cold in winter, the horror
- 1 mm snow causes traffic stops along mountain roads, snow plows are ready
People trapped in their cars cry they left their comfy homes because they wanted to see the snow but not like this
- Do kids these days get too much toys for Christmas
Are they good for them
- Is this year's Three Wise Men ride proof of the Left's war on Christmas
Uuh the only one that comes to my mind is this one from Bécquer:
"¿Qué es poesía? ¿Y tú me lo preguntas
Poesía… eres tú"
("What is poetry
And you ask it to me
Poetry
is you")
And a common sentence that I think is used by many people who don't even know the author (Pablo Neruda):
"Me gusta cuando callas porque estás como ausente"
("I like it when you shut up because you're like absent")
Without any doubt "Caminante no hay camino, se hace camino al andar" by Antonio Machado
It means something like "Walker, there's no path, the path is done when you walk"
O la canción del pirata:
"Con cien cañones por banda, viento en popa marinero"
What came to my mind was: "En tierra, en sombra, en polvo en nada" from Luis de Góngora (into soil, into shade, into dust, into nothing) the poem IS about a beautifull women Who eventually will loose everything that makes her pretty
Others: "volverán las oscuras golondrinas en tu balcón sus nidos a colgar" from Bécquer (the dark swallows Will in your balcony hung their nests) (the translation IS pretty awkward because the order of the sentence is: Will the dark swallows in your balcony hung their nest)
And: "polvo serán, mas polvo enamorado" Francisco de Quevedo (dust they'll be, though dust in love)
Really good
I was thinking in that poem too
Films based in Spain are full of stereotypes, romanticising many aspects of our culture, so it's kind of hard to find a good movie that represents us
I'm from Barcelona so they usually show the best parts of the city and nothing more
I think a good portrayal of Barcelona was in l[l'auberge espagnole ] spagnole
I'd say the problem relies on the fact* that while international cinema relies on Spanish stereotypes, Spanish cinema relies on regional and/or socioeconomic stereotypes or little to non-existent depictions of the locations
> that place where some dictator or bad guy has a secret bank account and the good guys need to close it down
Well, our former king (that is now living in Emirates so he won't face justice in case is required) had an account there for money laundering and most of our corrupt polititians too, so maybe is a real issue and not a Hollywood myth
Yes, we have Paella y flamenco as well
Olé!
Can't believe you just forgot the siesta
And "Money Heist".
Yeah, that doesn't count but I haven't watched it and it looks fun
Thanks
If you're studying in Barcelona (UB) as an exchange student catalan IS a footnote
That's not realistic
Otherwise study somewhere else like in UAB
You know you are swimming in pools of stolen money RIGHT NOW, not 70 years ago, don't you
Have you lived with foreign students in Barcelona
It's a movie about students living in Barcelona and it shows parts of Barcelona that aren't shown in other foreign movies
It has a realistic portrayal of it
Honestly if you expect real live in Barcelona from a catalan living here I guess you can watch any Catalan soap opera
They're talking about  something else
I bet your social benefits are higher than the highest salary I've ever had
I rather see you were touchy about the inner works of your country instead of people pointing at them
Oh, yeah, the courts of all the rest of the world are filled with those "literally no proof", but whatever
Apparently the Swiss press is as *discreet* as the Swiss banks
Cost of living is higher because you are rich

"I won't assume that every Spaniard is still bemoaning the passing of Franco because I'm not a complete fucking moron
That doesn't happen because he's been dead for 45 years, unlike your criminal bank industry
If you identify yourself with your banks, that's up to you
I didn't point who stole the money any time
I had to post that article in English because it literally is in other 5 languages and none of them is spoken in Switzerland:

Throw yourself out of a balcony
It's disrespectful for the Hotel employees that have to clean and the police that has to fill all the paperwork
Don't assume we like bullfighting, specially in the cities
Vast majority of young people despise every tradition related to cruelty with animals
Don't jump off balconies
Get close to a balcony
Specially British tourists
Damn senseless Finnish laws
Yeah, there's a common opinion in Spain that bullfighting would be nice and everything if it just didn't involved torturing and killing an animal
Lots of people would be ok with just "dodging" the bull and stuff like that, without all the violence involved
It was created in Roma
> Our beer has a bit more alcohol than in some other places
I imagine this plays a huge part
People who don't know a lot about beer think that if they have X amount at home they can have X amount in Belgium and it should be the same, right
No, not right
Pretty wrong, indeed
And England
So what
It's an italian dish
Cheap but pretty furniture and some cool food
Very popular here for young people
Also the vegan meatballs are kinda famous between vegans/vegetarians
Has the image of cheap furniture but they actually have low and high-end furniture
The high-end furniture is usually of good value for the price because of standardisation and volume
Traditional shops sometimes have better products and will generally provide a better service, and they might look more expensive but the price usually includes home delivery and assembly
Now again
you don't always need delivery and assembly
Also it's a great place to get ideas
Very good restaurant and food, I love the sour cream chips
Cheap and modern furniture, usually young couples
Then you have Leroy Merlin, Bricomart, Bauhaus etc
which caters another type of people
But not long lasting, at all
Even if the designs are kinda  cute I would never get an ikea kitchen if I wanted to have it for a long time, maybe some bookcase
When we furnished our house I only got ikea in the attic and one toilet
My Ikea bathroom furniture had problems with the humidity after just 2 years
Edit:wow all the "hurt"people cause I complained about ikea's quality
Man you need to chill, you don't own the business
It isn't personal
Cheap furniture is always bad, IKEA also have more expensive stuff
I don't know, I guess that it also depends on the product
The thing is ikea isn't even that cheap anymore so if you're going for a more expensive furniture go to a decent place
If you want to have a proper kitchen you go for a kitchen furniture business such as Santos, Aroca or Inko in Spain or go directly to small local shops
Kinda weird to know that as there's another IKEA in Seville, maybe they think it's cheaper in Portugal
Yeah sure, but people don't go to IKEA to do the kitchen, usually it's used to buy some desk, shelves, wardroves, etc
and it's really useful for students or young people that are renting a shitty flat, then when leaving the flat you can abandon the poor IKEA furniture there
If you have bought a flat/house then it's normal if you want to buy some better stuff
Actually lots of people go to IKEA to do their kitchen, just read all the "hurt" messages to my prior message ;)
That explains it all haha
oh, I guess I'm wrong, I've never used IKEA that way
For us catalonia and nationalism
Politics in general can get out of control
> I saw people trying to argue Japan was "Western" due to (among other reasons) their similar culture
Here's the thing: "Western culture"/"Western civilization"/"the West" is a veeeeery slippery concept, which can be applied in many variants
Japan is not culturally Western, but I would definitely say they are Western *politically* speaking
Latin America is totally Western from a political and cultural point of view, but if we are discussing geopolitics then "the West" is usually USA + Europe + ANZAC
And so on and so forth
Same with Russia, etc
So, I don't think this person was necessarily wrong, depending how they were framing their point
It's just hard to pinpoint "the West" accurately and it very much depends on what are you focusing in
(Incidentally, the same happens with "Eastern Europe"... do you mean geographically, politically, economically, culturally, ethnically, etc
Wow
Such a brave take on redditdotcom
Oops, sorry, I meant to summarize "Australia, New Zealand and Canada".
Yeah, in terms of global developed that's also a useful way of dividing things
Oh my god, you are the new Jesus
I bet you also think that Black panther was "just" ok
Someone should erect a monument to you
Probably best, yeah, I always read ANZAC in my mind as "Australia, New Zealand And Canada", hence my confusion and mistake xD
All hail the Messiah of Free Thought and Independence
There's a shared base in Rota that Spain uses for ships as well
Technically it is Spain's and we're just letting them use it, so I think if they ever told them to gtfo they would have to oblige
I don't like that it's there since I don't agree with most U.S. intervention in the middle East, but it's not of high importance to me
I'd much rather have NATO bases for joint NTO operations rather than US bases
in spain we call it "Embutido" but apart from this you also have some like "morcilla" ¿blood sausage
ok in english this sounds like a bad recipe for hallowen
>The Dutch, Italian, French and Swiss will never agree on which one makes the best
Spain enters the chat
Yeah
not necessarily applicable to all Europe
Here in Spain we have great water, but much of the south and eastern coast has horrible one
In spanish we say charcutería or chacinería, romance conexion
it dont finish to feel well
well you would be forgotte ones like this [
well in reality all the blood sausages
As a spaniard you have my eternal gratitude
Happy spanish sounds
now seriusly im quite tired that people only know us for paella
where have you been in Spain
I guess levante, water there is not good, is drinkable but too hard
Funny thing I learned a while back
We taught them that
The "fish frying" business (very common in southern Spain) was introduced by the sefardi comunity (Spanish Jews) to England
In fact, you can trace a surprising amount of fish frying down to the Iberian peninsula, from the US to Japan
Probably most famous internationally (at least seems to be very popular in food related subreddits) is manchego, which is a cured sheep cheese
Also, cabrales which is a STRONG blue cheese
Torta del Casar is a very creamy (you usually eat it over bread) but strong tasting cheese
Queso de Burgos is basically milk that you can eat instead of drink
But there any many, many others: it looks like almost every village here has it's own kind of cheese
Manchego (Castilla la Mancha) is the most famous and it's great, Cabrales (Asturias) if you like roquefort-like stuff also a weird suggestion is Mató (Catalonia) is eaten with honey as a dessert
Also other suggestions, Queso de Mahón (Menorca), Torta del Casar (Extremadura), Queso de Tetilla (Galicia), Idiazábal (Navarra)
There's a lot of good cheese here, Spain is like really bad at the internalization of our own products
We also have great wine, bread, olive oil, beer, etc
but all our products are always hidden behind the ones from another European country or sold as products of this country (a lot of Italian branded olive oils are actually from Spain)
I don't know, Spain being Spain I guess
I would say the most surprising would be torta del casar
It's a creamy, strong cheese
Think Munster but even more creamy
Then you have the blue cheeses in the north
Everyone here talking about Cabrales, but *"in my opinion** gamoneu reigns supreme
They go from more alike to Roquefort style to Gorgonzola
Then you have manchego cheeses, which I'm sure you know
They're sheep cheese (though I've seen cow), they vary a lot depending on the age (think how a young gouda has nothing to do with an old one)
So choose wisely
Then there's many more
You'll just have to find them out, from idiazabal to mahon
One of the great pleasures of Spain is just going to a region and tasting their cheeses
Check this page out if you want a bit more detail
Cabrales   [
its a tipe of blue cheese quite famous in spain
well the diferencies of climate and sheer sice help
Don't know about France, but here in spain
We have remarkably similar sweets
I've eaten them in Morocco and the flavours did ring a bell
>Same with fish
We live on an island surrounded by excellent fishing waters but we don't eat the fish, we sell it
(Or we did pre Brexit)
Yeah
Why though
We eat tons of fish here
Even in the interior
And we don't even have much fish left nowadays
Every time you hear the "EU" and "Fishing" Spain is there somewhere
Do you really have Spanish restaurants
How are they
(Shudders in fear)
yes but it doesnt englobe all the meats
They're pretty similar to a set of Spanish traditional sweets
>but isnt that common in other european countries too
Not really
Hungarian food isn't particularly spicy on the world stage but most countries in Europe are  spicy adverse
Probably, now that I think about it many fish eating countries are notably mountainous
Hmm interesting, I'll need a closer inspection
Do you know any by name, most have the menus online
This was
more interesting
The first you've got to know is that tapas isn't the norm in Spain at all, we eat in restaurants
However there is a strong tendency to "modernize" classics, especially when talking about starters or tapas
This restaurant follows that idea
some of the time
That means there's some reaaaaaallly weird stuff going on, like "hake wrapped in jamón with Spanish lentils" which will cause (at the very least) a coginitive dissonance in any Spaniard
There's also an extended use of harissa
which isn't used in Spain, and butter bean hummus, which I have never seen (though it may exist and butter bean is in fact typical of Valencia and fricking delicious)
There's also very non Spanish dishes (no way how you look at them) like chargrilled sweet potato
I would say it's a weird combination of Spanish "restaurant
" And "international" "tapas bar"...but it's pretty confusing
Though this is actually closer to what a Spanish restaurant might look like
A few classics (though with a bit more taste in my opinion) and a few novelties, often using foreign ingredients, or new techniques
It's kind of the opposite question
The UK has tons of variety, that's not common at all in Europe
It's actually pretty on point
Of course there is some funky stuff, but it's ok
Funny to see the combination of dishes
You wouldn't get a menu like that anywhere on Spain, it's a weird mix from everywhere and anywhere
there's some very homemad-y stuff like empanadillas, next to southern classics like "pescaíto frito" and northern deserts like Tarta de Santiago
I wouldn't say it mimics a Spanish restaurant as much as it mimics Spanish cooking along the territory
It's a strange scene
Spain here
I live in a city of 150k, used to be one that closed, we have Polish products in a shop that says it's Russian
And yes because I'm half Polish and can't live without my Pierogi
Yep, and since we discovered it my dziadzio doesn't have to send us as much things, only pierogis
No, they are very uncommon
And I don't think the average Spaniard know the name of any Polish product xD
There are some supermarket chains like Lidl or department stores like El Corte Inglés that have sections of international food that change once in a while so I guess that they might've had some Polish stuff at one moment
But it's not usual and I haven't seen any specialised store either
Maybe in bigger cities
What I have seen are stores of groceries from different Latino countries, from Morocco and from China with some extra stuff from other East Asian countries
Spain here
I am not aware of what polish groceries are
Never seen any marketed as such
Edit: I do not live in a big city though
Maybe you can find some in Madrid or Barcelona
But I've never heard of such thing
Eastern european countries and everything around the USSR & CCCP, I think that the main reason is that I've never been properly taught about it
Everything is always about France, England, some Italy and Germany, then for the XX century everything is always explained frome the USA perspective and the East is mostly ignored (not only Eastern Europe, also Asia)
So as an adult I find fascinating everything related to this because it feels new and different
Lately I'm also really interested in the story of China, it's a fascinating country
Austria and Armenia
From our history ive learnt we are stupid, and we have hard heads, our people have specialized througth history in killing between brothers, and partying over no reason
Shanghai's history for me
Yeeees, China story is completely ignored and even despised by most western people and it's great
I also find Japan and specially China very interesting with all the different dinasties but come on, European history from the collapse of the Roman Empire until pretty much First World War is the most complicated and convoluted thing ever
There´s so many wars followed by peace treaties with parties shifting sides, that it´s hard to follow
I study in Japan now and had once a class of History in IR where mostly it was European IR until the 20th Century and my asian classmate said once "compared to European history, Chinas once was at least understandable"
> our people have specialized througth history in killing between brothers, and partying over no reason
Ahh, that explains why we're nowadays so good at it
> and partying over no reason
U need a reason for that
Back in high school, it was embarrassing learning how much of a mess the 19th century was for the country
It also explains a lot of our current situation
It´s important to talk about the WWs for sure but you don´t focus on the whole Habsburg dinasty that much then
They were pretty much one of the big powerhouses for hundreds of years
In Spain we talk a lot about it as Spain and Austria had the same Habsburg dinastic line for quite a while until the succession war in 1701
800,000 years ago
I want to know who ate Gran Dolina Kid and if they seasoned him
i would travel to 1885 and try to save the live of Alfonso XII a king that was beloved by the people and seems as one of the good kings against his song alfonso XIII wich was a truly bad king
That or maybe try to make Luis Amadeo of Savoy remain as a king
Year 1000 BC
Visit the Tartessians before the Roman conquest and find out if the stories the Greeks and Romans told about them are true
Id like to see what the aztec or inca empires looked like
around 1000 during the Ummayad period of the Cordoba caliphate
I would make a trip to see the differences between the christian kingdoms and the caliphate and how they used to interact
It's Movida Madrileña in the 80's for me
About the same thing but the country just came out of a decades long dictatorship and people went completely crazy with everything
As i had regarded he was a liberal and a progresive king wich its what i think that Spain needed as it was a country that was lacking behind Europe
also his main oposition was eighter becouse he was a king or becouse he was elected
Apart from the carlist and republicans the liberals supported him a lot, imagine that they tried to convince him to stay but as he said «Ah, per Bacco, io non capisco niente
Siamo una gabbia di pazzi — No entiendo nada, esto es una jaula de locos-I don't understand anything, this is a crazy cage ».
i know russia (if that counts as europe) and would probably recognize the british one, but not much else really
I know the Spanish anthem (who wouldn’t) and I also know part of the Italian and German, as well as the Marseillaise off by heart, it’s just so badass sounding
God save the queen too
Man, I can recognise a few if I listen to them (English, French, Italian)but can we all agree that Russia's is by far the coolest anthem
I feel like fighting for mother Russia just by listening to it
I don't know the lyrics since the languages are different, but when I hear them I know where are they from
My favorite one is the russian anthem
I don't follow any sport, so I'm not exposed to anthems
You also gotta know the Spanish lyrics
> I can hum
My man, everybody can do this with the spanish one, even us spaniards
The reason is that spanish anthem has no lyrics hehehe
Spain had anthem with lyrics during the dictatorship but it was changed when it ended because it's a fascist anthem
I’d say everyone knows the words to the spanish anthem xD
Yes I know it's patriotic, but here in Spain (sadly) patriotism was a synonym of fascism since they used the flag and the anthem to glorify it
Maybe it's sad, maybe it's ridiculous, but nowadays thinking about having a patrotic lyrics reminds us the dictatorship
The Spanish anthem officially has no lyrics
That’s why I said everyone knows the words
The Spanish anthem officially has no lyrics
That’s why I said everyone knows the lyrics
That's why I said it's sad
I wish patriotism wasn't seen as fascism in Spain, and I wish people didn't use it to attack each other
But that's what we have after almost 40 years of fascism, the wounds are still open
The wounds may still be open to most resentful Leftists, Communists and Separatists, but the great majority of Spaniards thankfully got past that a long time ago
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the leftists, communist and independentistas were the most affected people during the civil war and the dictatorship
Instead of learning of our mistakes, the rightist keep attacking to that groups
As long as the right continues to use nationalism to do harm, I will continue to feel weird with patriotic symbols
What wealth
It has to be Karlos Arguiñano's cookery show
It has switched networks a few times, but his programme has been on air for 25 years, 5 days a week if I am not mistaken
It took me a day to understand andalusian accent in seville
Not im my country and even though it's not really the question, i can't unserstand dominican spanish,It just sounds foreign
All the Spanish accents are understandable between each other, so no
It struck me to know that some English-speaking people could not be able to understand between each other because of their accents
I was startled because that doesn't happen in Spanish
I guess it is because Spanish is a completely phonetic language and has a very consistent pronuntiation system
But there is always the case that you can not understand a person, not for their accent but because they do not pronounce properly or have a very lazy spelling
To this day I'm convinced certain parts of Andalucia don't speak Spanish
I would say very thick (maybe rural
) accents from: Galicia, Andalucía & Catalonia can be the hardest to understand
funnily enough when I lived in Ireland, it was Dublin's Northside accent that really got me
I had problems with some areas of Andalucía. I understood but it was harder than usual or I had to ask the person to repeat the sentece
I am from Madrid and I genuinely cannot understand some people from Córdoba or Jaén (not the capitals but the villages around)
Pretty much like with italian and portuguese, i I never learned catalonian nor galician but can understand about 70% of it
Madrid outskirts: when I was a child it was common to have 3-4 days of snow a year, sometimes more
I don't remember now the last time I saw snow on the ground
However, it's common in the mountains and the north
Where I live, in Málaga, in the south of Spain it snow 0 days of 365
Depends
At the mountains every year for many days
A day each two years, if we only count when the snow can settle
Spain
It really depends on the region and altitude but lets say generally speaking and focusing on cities like ... once or twice every two or three years in random 50% areas of the country specially towards the inner region (not coast)
Here they are well accepted, unless exceptions
I've seen medics, policemans, lawyers
with piercings and covered with tattoos
In Spain is the same as you mention for Germany, 2
288,28€.
Also, something that confuses some people is that we use billion as a million of millions, rather than the British billion, which is a thousand millions
when i was a child i was taught to use ' as decimal
3'141592
200'0003
it was in the 80'
we use the german mode 1
200,55€ (so comas for decimal separator)
It is always confusing though
I still get confused sometimes with the billion and billion
I’ve seen a lot of people write it like this tho 2
288’28€ or 2 288’28€. A lot of people use ‘ as ,
Never seen anyone use . tho
Current recommendations from the RAE is to use spaces to separate the thousands
This is to avoid confusion with the fact that some Spanish-speaking countries use dots as decimal separator, and some use commas as decimal separator
So both are currently considered valid
I like our billion, from a mathematical point of view It just makes more sense
I can almost forget that we don't call 1000 ten hundred
Not used in Spain, but the dot is the norm in some other spanish speaking countries
Millón (million)
Mil millones (thousand millions)
Billón (billion)
Mil billones (thousand billions)
Well
if you want to minimize the amount of words you have to "invent" to Code the name of a number (and still mantain base ten) It would go 10, 100, 10000, 100000000, ...
The same way, It makes sense for a mathematician to name 1
000
000 times a 1
000
000 a billion, It saves "number names".
In fact the BEST way to do It would be base 2, as done with computers
With 10 number names which IS what we need to get to 9 you could go Up to  512, without ever having to do like the romans
Of course from a day to day point of view this IS an absurd point, there's no reason to minimize the number of words needed
But again
if you want a down to earth argument ask AN engineer
This IS a student rambling
(Spain)
As some other Spanish redditors commented, it is often seen as the default mainly among the younger generation, while middle aged people may identify as religious but most don't practice at all except maybe taking part in some ceremonies
Of course old people tend to be more into it
I have to say however that in my experience, even though suffering public rejection is fortunately unheard of nowadays except in some hardcore religious groups, you can expect some degree of it in very socially conservative environments (in my town of origin not all but many people won't regard you in a good way if you skipped an important mass while being in town for example)
In bigger towns and cities nobody cares one bit, people are more open and accepting
The are not view good or bad, Spain follows a culture of live and let live so basically no one really cares about religious beliefs of neighbours or fellow countrymen
Spain has a huge amount of irreligion or atheists over 14 million people (30
3% of the population as of January 2020) while Spain is mostly catholic, practicing is falling really quick
Two decades ago used to be around 75% of the population and now is around 42%
It depends
Most religious people here aren't really that religious (believing in God but going to church only in holyday days)
There's still church going people and then we have devoted people
If you told any of these you are an atheist it is most likely that the first type will get angry with you (and probably call you a communist)
The second type is usually more comprehensive (yet not always)
atheist are always anoying over here
they are like ultra religious people, just anoying and uncomfortable to talk to
agnostics are fine tho, just like moderate believers
Well in Spain by law you can burn down a restaurant if they bring you Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola when you actually ordered Coca-Cola, so here things are more serious about cola brands than religion
Dude wtf no, they don't try to shove their beliefs down people's trougts
I don't think there's any difference between religious and atheists
Normally, they celebrate the holidays cause they see it as part of culture and tradition
This is not true
Atheists may come as annoying or bad to really religous people, often catholics that are from other generations
But right now, and in the younger generations, atheists live a normal live as everyone else, and don't really brag about being an atheist or confront other people for not being it
What surprises me is that from the information that I have gotten in the internet, and some studies, in Spain around 70% of people are Catholic
Although you don't even notice
many do try
it's as anoying talking to a militant atheist as it is to a militan religious person
Sure, but I really don't know many, from ether side
Our previous prime minister (Mariano Rajoy )was a walking joke, when he got lost in a sentence he would say absurd things
These are one of my favourites:
*Holding a glass of milk* "¡VIVA EL VINO
(LONG LIVE THE WINE
* At an election rally* "Es el vecino el que elige al alcalde y es el alcalde el que quiere que sean los vecinos el alcalde"
(It is the neighbor who chooses the mayor and it is the mayor who wants the neighbors to be the mayor)
*In the parlament, refering to the leader of Podemos, a left-wing political party*
"Cuanto peor mejor para todos y cuanto peor para todos mejor, mejor para mí el suyo, beneficio político"
(The worse, the better for all, and the worse for all, the better, the better for me, yours, political benefit)
It is the hell of Spanish syntax
Manita arriba for the translations
* "Somos sentimientos y tenemos seres humanos" ("We are feelings and we have human beings")
* "Tenemos que fabricar máquinas que nos permitan seguir fabricando máquinas porque lo que nunca va a hacer una máquina es fabricar máquinas" ("We have to fabricate machines that let us continue fabricating machines because what a machine will never do is fabricate more machines")
* "Me gusta Cataluña, me gustan sus gentes, \[...\], son emprendedores, hacen cosas, exportan" ("I like Catalonia, I like its peoples, \[...\], they are entrepenurial, they do things, they export")
* "La cerámica de Talavera no es cosa menor, dicho de otra manera, es cosa mayor" ("Ceramics from Talavare are not a minor things, to put it in another manner, they are a major thing")
* "It's very difficult todo esto" ("It's very difficult all of this")
* "España es una gran nación y los españoles muy españoles y mucho español" ("Spain is a great nation, and the Spaniards very Spanish and much Spanish")
* "Esto no es como el agua del cielo que cae sin que se sepa muy bien por qué" ("This is not like the rain from the sky which falls without anyone really knowing why")

The wild thing is that apparently he was a pretty good orator in Parliament back when he was leader of the opposition (pre-2012), it was only (mostly) after becoming PM that he began doing these things
The toll of leadership, I guess xD
And my personal favourite:
He voted against the national budgets proposed by himself
Here you can get in trouble for sending threats or trying to revolt against the king but not being able to joke about him sounds awful, sorry turkbros
It was more the way he said it that sounded more absurd, in Spanish syntax the phrase is quite messy and lacks meaning
Thank you there
He did multiple fucks up anyway, so
kind of counts lol
Well at least you can point the stupidity of it
There is no "-sh" in Spanish (oh, the irony), except for the former PM Rajoy
In spanish i had heard 2 ways one with the t ond one without the t
in english ii would say with the s instead of the sh
I say both, tbh
I know it's supposed to be pronounced with a -sh- but sometimes I forget and just use -s-.
Weeeell in some parts of Andalucía "ch" is pronounced "sh". But yeah no "sh" sound in standard Spanish
That's sh-, not -sh
Also, it exists even in my dialect, not an Argentine exclusive
That's sh-, not -sh
I'm from the Canary Islands in Spain
We generally have it a bit better than some other overseas territories in other countries due to how much tourism we get
I'd say most of the younger generations keep in touch with the mainland but if you go to smaller communities they tend to feel more isolated
The majority of people feel European due to our relative closeness to the continent and the fact that we never really had any other ruler besides Spain for 500 years
There's plenty of local news here in Tenerife especially when it comes to radio or newspapers, I can't say for any of the other islands
But often when watching news on TV you could feel a bit disconnected from a robbery that has happened 500 km away in a town you've never heard of
As for relatives, most are in Ireland
However most people I know have atleast one close relative that lives in the mainland
I live in the United States and the other day a Mexican guy was fixing something in my house
I switched to Spanish and he suddenly was like "where are you from
" "Do you speak Spanish in Spain
" To which I answered, "seems like it"
Hahahahah, sounds about right
However my family are actually Irish, only my mum wanted to escape the shitty weather
Play your cards right and we can be relatively close to 3 continents ;)
Nah my family is actually Irish, just my mum decided to move to Tenerife
Python, Go and C++ so I won't have any problem in the future finding jobs
Korean, French and Iberian
Such a shame Iberian is almost completely lost, it is impossible to learn it with the knowledge we have today
I have a long list of languages I want to learn, to be honest
The ones which should be useful to communicate with as many people as possible (and that have business value, for example) would be Chinese, German and possibly French
The latter two would greatly help me move across Europe
An extra boost to my English would be nice, too
The ones I like would be Swedish, Icelandic, Japanese
And I'd love to learn Russian or Polish, or even Finnish
Old languages like Latin, Goth, Old Norse, Celt dialects, Iberian, etc
would be cool too though
Probably French, I've never been really good at it
Also German and Chinese
I would never learn Chinese in any other way, it looks too hard to read to even try
Russian, Mandarin chinese and Basque
Russian because it's very useful in the ex-soviet countries and can be used in very different countries
Mandarin because China is gaining weight and influence in the world, plus I really like China
Basque because it is something that I always wanted to learn but I feel it's too difficult and not useful in my situation, as I live far fron the Basque Country
If one day I move to the Basque Country or Navarra I'm pretty sure I will learn it
Europeans: German, russian and french
I migt be learning German soon either way, because i want to study there and russian and french are great for travel
I once Saw a russian, a montenegrin and a Czech talking no problem with each other and that just feels crazy to me
I also really like how russian and german sound
All included: mandarin, french, german
Mandarin just for the sake of understanding 1
3 "billion" people, plus i want to explore china one day of these and It might come usefull
French would just be great, if you Talk french and english you can kind of get by in Africa as a whole (with some exceptions) and that would be amazing
if I got to keep the ones I already speak, I would probably choose German and Russian, which I've been thinking about studying
Not sure about the 3rd, maybe Dutch or Arabic
Mandarin because of the huge amount of speakers, Japanese so I can read untranslated LN (yes I'm a fucking weeb) and basque just to flex
German, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese
- German: useful language to know in Europe, can allow me to work there more easily as well
- Chinese: China is one of the most powerful countries in the world, and it keeps growing
Adding to this, the language is very difficult so to be able to speak it without having to learn would be a huge advantage
- Japanese: Uhh, yeah, I like Japan, I'm kind of a weeb
And the language is not easy either
I considered picking French, which I've started studying recently, but as a Spaniard it's an easy language to learn so I can do that on my own
But do I lose the ones I already know
If I'm still able to speak the ones I know (Catalan, Spanish, English) I'd learn German, Chinese, Japanese
If I have to choose only 3: Catalan, Spanish and English
>also makes Italian somewhat understandable
I can vouch for that
the written form is really similar and the pronunciation isn't crazy like with portuguese or french
I can at least make sense of some slowly talked italian and the written form is way easier
This reminds me I actually tried to find resources to learn at least a bit of our Iberian language, but found none of it
It's a shame it disappeared so harshly that nowadays there is close to zero information about it
Celtiberian and the different celtic dialects of the north/north-east would be great too
I just wish we knew as much about our native tonges as other countries in Europe do (for example, there seems to be much more information about gaulish languages, even though those became extinct too)
Maybe Goth would be interesting too
If I remember well, northern Spain was the last place (or at least one of them) outside of Eastern Europe were this germanic language was still spoken
If I had to go for a pre-Roman language, I'd probably choose tartésico
I also want to learn “sort of Iberian”, but in my case it would be the Spanish languages that I don’t know as well as Portuguese:
+Euskera
+Galician
+Portuguese
Catalán/Valencian and Castilian Spanish I already know, so those are the main languages I’ve got left
Yep, it was spoken in the east of the peninsula before the romans came
If I remember correctly in the west you had Tartessian and Lusitanian
This [website] has all the info we know about pre-roman languages (is not much though)
In the case of Iberian we know how to pronounce it and read it, but the meaning is completely lost
There is a "Rosetta stone" (Arquitrabe de Sagunto) with an inscription in Latin and its (supossedly) translation in Iberian, but it is broken and a lot of the information is lost
We can only hope that someday we find something similar to finally learn the language
Yeah tartéstico would be really cool too, the tartessian civilization is really interesting
Yes, the problem with portuguese IS pronunciation
Italian IS Close enough so that we understand most words and the pronunciation IS pretty straightforward, so even though portuguese IS Closer It ends Up being HARDER to understand
I guess that in the end Latin fused with all the languages of that era and we ended up with the million languages we have in the peninsula, but yeah it would be nice to know the original languages
At midnight no people outside of the pub at the terrace or just hanging around, everyone in, doors close and smoking is allowed (kinda)
So neighbours don't complain
If they serve you beer bottles instead of glasses, don't bring them back to the bar when you're done, they're a sign of status and seniority
It isn't an unwritten rule if nobody follows it
Man those are the best :)
I thought regulations regarding pubs would be laxer up there given the big culture present
Where I'm from it's normal for establishments to stay open well into the next day's early morning (3-4am or even until later)
ask the barman
Otherwise they're going to think you're stealing
Barcelona citizen here so I'll speak about my city only
They're everywhere in the centre of the city, specially in the whole Plaça Catalunya-Las Ramblas-Barceloneta area, and they wear huge firearms
Since 2020 has been a weird year I haven't seen them that much, mostly because there isn't any tourism so I'm guessing that the risk of having a terrorist attack has been reduced
Also, a lot of cops are dressed as civilians in that area but they still carry guns with them
In the rest of the city you can see the heavily armed ones sometimes, but it's not as common
All the police I have seen were armed with hand-arms
I have even seen traffic police with G36s.
In the Basque country where I live, It's pretty common, and has always been
Since there was this terrorist organization ETA and a many violent protests on the streets, police was very common and most of times heavily armed
It all went calm after in 2010 ETA was finally dissolved and people began focusing more on Catalonia
However this year with covid restrictions been  skipped, you won't go outside without seeing a couple of police cars
I have lived in several cities of Spain and the usual equipment is a pistol
Traffic agents may not carry it within the city
Heavier weapons (submachine guns or shotguns) are usually seen only if there is a terrorism alarm
When ETA still existed you could see heavy guns guarding the entrance of some official buildings too
That's pretty much just Madrid or Barcelona
In the rest of the country, policemen of whatever force carry a "just" handgun
It's unthinkable for me that a policeman wouldn't carry a weapon, like it seems to happen in other countries
You could see an increase in their numbers and start seeing rifles when the risk of terrorist attacks was through the roof
Now you see many more patrol cars because of covid, trying to enforce all the measures
In Alicante I've only really noticed them in the airport, not around the city
Definitely not in towns (as far as I can tell)
They carry heavy arms only when they are looking for a specific, dangerous criminal
They get you when you run out of luck
That's funny because the only place I've seen regular police with heavy firearms, other than in special deployments, is in the UK
Here in Donosti havs been some confrontation between youngsters doing botellón and ertzaintzas armed with rubber ball guns, remembering the good old days when kale borroka was a thing, garbage containers set in fire and policemen formed in squad
You see, half of the cars around La Línea carry a ton of hashish
Oceania, and America is one continent that has three subcontinents: North, Central and South America, being CA what's between Mexico and South America
Five continents, just as the five olympic rings represent the five continents of the world since 1920
We don't care for Antartica cause they are not good at sports over there
Zealandia was considered a full fledged continent like one or two years ago, so it is not taught, and most data is not updated
The seven-continent model is usually taught in most English-speaking countries including the United States, United Kingdom[38] and Australia,[39] and also in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and parts of Western Europe
The six-continent combined-Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan
The six-continent combined-America model is often used in Latin America,[40] Greece,[23] and countries that speak Romance languages
The United Nations[24] and in the Olympic Charter[25] in its description of the Olympic flag derived the five-continent model from the combined-America model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited
Can confirm
I tend to still use the word America to refer to the US in spanish and they always give me the "But you're american".
I won't forget that Canadian girl that was mad at me when she asked me whether I had been to Canada and I answered I had never been to America
Earth Has a New Continent Called 'Zealandia', Study Reveals
But according to a new study of Earth's crust, there's a seventh geologic continent called 'Zealandia', and it has been hiding under our figurative noses for millennia
The 11 researchers behind the study argue that New Zealand and New Caledonia aren't merely an island chain
Instead, they're both part of a single, 4
9-million-square kilometre (1
89 million-square-mile) slab of continental crust that's distinct from Australia
"This is not a sudden discovery but a gradual realisation; as recently as 10 years ago we would not have had the accumulated data or confidence in interpretation to write this paper,"
Since yor comment was a mere link it was hidden by the automod so I can't reply to it
>‘The importance of Zealandia is not so much that there is now a case for a formerly little-known continent, but that by virtue of its being thinned and submerged, but not shredded into microcontinents, it is a new and useful continental end member
’ This view is reiterated in the conclusion to the paper, ‘Zealandia is not a collection of partially submerged continental fragments \[as was inferred for Pacifica\] but is a coherent 4
9 Mkm2 continent
This is from your pdf, it says what I said, Zealandia is a continent
and this was on the news recently
It didn't ceased to exists (as you say) it was discovered that exists
Mexico is in North America
North America has USA, Canada and Mexico
Was pretty bad
But it got better with time
It's still not very bike friendly but at least the Dutch can manage now
In my city it's horrible, there aren't that many bike lanes and many of the ones that exist exclusive aa lanes for biked are abandoned
Bur many bike lanes are on the road itself, so you either move out of the way to let cars pass or live with the fact that you're inconveniencing someone
I know my city infrastructure is complicated to adapt as most streets are narrow but the unattended lanes just shows there isn't much interest anyway
We eat
a lot and talk
while eating
We mostly eat
There's always some drama but mostly it's just a pretty chill reunion
Got a big family so we split the time with my father's family and my mother's family
I usually hang out more with my father's family, but for Christmas or special occasions we hang out with my mother's family as it's pretty big
My family gatherings are just my parents and me now (they're divorced but they have a good relationship and hang out often), so there's not much
The "larger" family gatherings were not even that large, that'd be my parents, 4 grandparents, my uncle and his SO (and me)
It's just
Talking
Nothing interesting goes down

Pictured me surprised
Didn't know it was still such a big deal
He was from the Republic of Genova, but he is a very important figure in Spain's history, that's why I listed him
There are many regions in Spain with their own Columbus' origin story, taken with different levels of seriousness
I should have included Estanislao Figueras as well, just for his very famous phrase during a cabinet meeting:
"Gentlemen, I'll be frank you with you
I have fucking had it with us all
" (Caballeros, voy a serles franco
Estoy hasta los cojones de todos nosotros)
It's very well known that he was from the Republic of Genova, but he is definitely an important figure in the history of Spain, that's why I listed him
There are many regions in Spain with their own Columbus' origin story, taken with different levels of seriousness
But everyone knows that the official history at least says he's genoese XD
He was Italian (Genoan, to be more precise), but he is definitely a historical figure in Spain
“Gentlemen, I can’t take it anymore
I’ll be honest with you
I’m bloody tired of all of us”
I think it would be a more accurate translation
But for a president it was kinda a strong statement
But I didn’t know about while I knew the quote
Clarification for foreigners: we do study it but not to the point of learning the names of inquisitors
Torquemada is the most famous one (and the only one I personally know) but I wouldn't say everyone knows him
I wanted to add a very strong swear word to match the strong "cojones" used by Figueras
Fair enough then
Are the Brit tourist in your country also jumping from the balconies and dying
Is quite common in Spain, specially in summer and in places like Magaluf or Salou
Are the balconies existing in Britain
&#x200B;
This is the thrid case in **this week
&#x200B;
Normally they are getting drunk and trying to jump from the balcony to the pool of the hotel, sometimes with fatal consecuences
&#x200B;
Lloyd Milen said  "Brits don't typically have balconies in their homes, so they're not used to it
" .
&#x200B;
Is it the case
Is it common in your country
In  Spain is so common that it has his own name: "balconing"
_Cries in living in Mallorca and all the balconing news every week in regional TV_
Do you realize that if somehow Spain is at war against UK, the only thing we have to do to defeat them is move the pools a metre away
Edit: typo
Funny to find this topic because a friend of mine just sent me yesterday  [
In spain we have a spanenglish verb for that    balconing
>"Brits don't typically have balconies in their homes, so they're not used to it
Gracias, edito
WTF I love bar owners now
In Spanish we usually treat it more like a noun:
"Murió haciendo balconing" = "He died doing balconing";
"El balconing es muy peligroso" = "Balconing is very dangerous".
I think it's not a a beautiful sounding leanguage and I like my nother tongue way more
For example, if I explain my feelings in english, I feel completely detached from what I'm saying
I use it almost all my day
It's a clusterfuck of made up rules that don't reinforce each other, and pronunciation can be anything
Still get a lot of productivity of it, but i enjoy using my native spanish more
Spaniard here: there are five vowel sounds in our language
The Latin alphabet has 5 vowels : a, e, i, o, and u. I guess you can see what's my main complain about using English
I enjoy It
It's grown on me ever since I lived in Ireland
In the future I would like to gain a native accent and level C2
Many here are pointing out that English has a huge vocabulary
While that's true, some languages like spanish can easily compete
That's probably why english has never stricken me as particularly vocabulary rich
I have a deep respect and appreciation for my mother tongue, so, even though I love English, Spanish will always have a prime place in my heart
English pronunciation is anarchic
I use it as a tool
I don't know about you, but I don't like my tools to be anarchic
It is more flexible than spanish
But spanish sounds more powerful
> Our spelling is a lot more consistent (even if not obvious at first if you don't know the rules)
This
I always hear people saying that French is more inconsistent in its spelling/pronunciation than English, but that is not true
Yeah, French has stuck with its historical spelling, and three vowels are pronounced as one, but the sound of those three vowels does not change
If you see those three vowel combination, you'll know how to exactly pronounce it; whilst this is not possible in English because one letter, or combination of them, can be pronounced in a lot of different ways
Just a little rant xD
There are other languages with an unnecessary amount of vowel sounds but they thought "hey, maybe we should write them as ä, à, â, å... Ya, that should do the job". Meanwhile you guys went: "I bet I'll know how to do it when i see it, fuck it".
Tell that to the French speakers
Spanish name\*, it literally means "mercies", the plural form of mercy
Try Portuguese or danish
It sounds like they're required to say the word but they're too tired to care, so the ending is a fluke
Well, the initial outbreak "started" near my municipality and now we have outbreaks here too, soo I'm not really confident in going back to school
If anyone is wandering, I'm from the south of the comunidad de Madrid
I live in Bratislava, pretty safe here for my boy at the kindergarten
In the words of one of the country's largest civil servants' unions: "[schools do not have enough staff, protocols, or resources to implement the Early Response Plan to the Covid19 designed by the Ministry of Health] In short, a plan exists but it seems impossible that it will be implemented by September (which is when the schools should be reopened)
This is totally credible according to our experience of past months (in April they were supposed to give financial aid to the self-employed workers to survive the lockdown and there is still people who have not received it
They also talk about the fact that the systems to be able to give classes online have not been improved, so the situation in this sense remains as chaotic and uneven as it was during the lockdown
Considering that classrooms in most of Spain were already overcrowded before all this madness, to this day I have no confidence that this will work and I am worried about several members of my family who are teachers (and of course worried about the children
I think the best humoristic quotes are from M. Rajoy
Some of his best quotes are:
•"I like Catalonia, I like it's people
They do things"
•"We are feelings and we have human beings"
•"Is the citizen the one who chooses the mayor and is the mayor who wants to be the citizens, the mayor"
•"Spain it's a great nation and the spaniards very spanish and a lot spanish"
•"You think before talking or you talk after thinking
•"ETA (a terrorist group) is a great nation
Spain, sorry it's a great nation"
•"The worst the better for everyone and the worst for everyone the better, the better for me  the yours political benefit"
Yes, he was our president
Julius Caesar once said: “Beati Hispani quibus bibere vivere est
” wich means "blissful are the Spanish, for whom drinking is living"
Well, Mariano Rajoy has sort of humoristic quotes
Our former PM, Mariano Rajoy, was famous for his weird quotes, like:
"The spanish, very spanish and a lot of spanish",
"When Worse, better for everyone, and when better, for everyone, Worse, for me, and yours, political benefit",
"It's the neighbors who choose the mayor, and it's the mayor Who wants the neighbors to be the mayor",
"Because after year 14, comes year 15",
"Talavera's ceramics aren't a minor thing, said differently, they are a Major thing",
"One thing is being solidary and other one is being It for nothing in return",
"We are feelings and we have human beings",
"It's very difficult todo esto",
"¿Do you think before speaking or speak after thinking
"I said i would lower taxes but i am raising them"
"Be like me, don't get into politics" - Francisco Franco
Well, I mean, she's right
- A glass is a glass and a dish is a dish
- We are feelings and have human beings
- It's the neighbor the one who chooses the mayor, and it's the mayor the one who want to be the neighbors the mayor
- ETA is a great nation
- I like Catalonia, I like its people, they are hardworking, they do things
- Glory to the wine
(while drinking milk)
- You see, something remarkable has happened to me
I wrote down some notes, but I can't read my own handwriting (during a radio talk)
Of course we have, they are in Spanish obviously but here you go:
One of my favourites is: "We are feelings and we have human beings"
Not even him knows what he was trying to say
Not to good
I'm sorry
I know they have beautiful mountains and that they learn spanish really really fast
Damn it, I was gonna make the same joke
Quoting the username of the guy you're responding to
That's a power move and I respect it
Romania, as well as other countries that have significant inmigration in Spain, tend to have the reputation that these people have generally speaking, which is not that great at this point
Meaning that the average Spaniard ignores almost everything else about the actual Romania, sorry, we are very self absorbed
The same way that in many southamerican countries Spaniards used (or even today) to be seen as hardworking but somewhat dull people, because of the waves of humble, uneducated and starving  people that left Spain looking for a better life on the early and mid 20th century (many of them from my region, Galicia)
In Costa Rica they even have "Gallego" (Galician) as a derogatory term for dull people, out of xenophobia and ignorance
Same as in Spain regarding Romania because of the Romanian gypsies
For me, Romania is just Bucharest, Ceausescu and his palace, Transilvania legends and Gica Hagi
I don't know much about it's landscape or culture
I think for us it is the least known of our latin/romance family, and a country still to be discovered as a travel destination
Unfortunately your people are treated really bad there, and I apologize for that also
Ah there's nothing we can do against that
Or maybe yes, idk
I think the racism against Romanians in Spain has more to do with the country they come from (and obviously the amount of immigration) than from any association with gypsies
Basically because there are a lot of gypsies themselves with their fair share of racial discrimination, but I would say these two are distinct
There might be but it's too hot right now and I'm going to go to sleep until it's cooler
Night night
> I mean originally it was xenophobia, but now we do it because tradition
I feel the same, I don't think "gallego" is necessarily offesnive nowadays
I'd say it's got more to do with unfair association with crime
Im from the north of Spain, from the province of Soria, we ain't mediterranean at all and sadly i've never had the chance to travel outside of Spain but i always felt like italians and portuguese are close to us and quite similar, romanian speakers, well they are already a different thing, amd french speakers
Well i don't really feel them closer to us than a german or a british, but honestly i may not be the more objective when talking about France
I am from Northern Spain and somehow I feel more related to the Atlantic or Celtic Europe than to the Mediterranean Area
Even when our languages are so different the landscapes, food or cultural traditions are very familiar to me
I think it's more of a historical/geographical thing
So for example most spaniards feel close to italians
But it's more of a Southern thing in both countries
Galicia IS much Closer to Portugal and overall both northern Spain and Italy have closer ties with France
It might seem it's a linguistic link but then there's Romania which shares very little culturally with the rest of romance speaking countries
In the other hand there's malta, they speak semitic and they're among the closest countries to Italy
In the end language doesn't have an overarching influence in culture
However it's a nice way to broaden nationalistic claims
that's why serbian, Bosnian and Croatian are "different" languages despite all being the same, or why languages get forbidden again and again
They're a tangible and clear difference in a world where culture is often gradual
So to add Up: most times countries which share similar languages are Close not because of the language but because of common history, or proximity, which develops into cultural ties (we use the same deck of cards as Italy, canelones are a regional Dish in Catalonia, malta eats timpana, and greece baklava)
Many times similar enviroment upbring similar customs, like cider culture in northern Spain and certain parts of the UK
Finally, language can be used to broaden cultural differences and that's made language a target of nationalism (and even centralism), which has "created" new languages (Urdu vs Hindi) as well as destroy them (the BEST example i could think of is the US, though many countries have tried It with different levels of succes
Spain has tried to kill it's languages for a loooong time and during the franco regime shit hit the fan, essentially forbiding use outside the home)
Portugal = Spain = Italy
France and Romania
Well
Yes, in fact I think the language is the only thing that makes us different, otherwise, I wouldn't feel closer to someone from Madrid than to someone from Rome
He doesn't sound like the most unbiased source
Do you feel any link to the Canarians
Is "uma hora menos en Açores" a thing
The Brazilians I've met in Spain don't feel different than Colombians or Venezuelans, for instance
I'm from Asturias hehe
The same thing happened to me while visiting London, I felt the landscapes in the countryside were like my home region, just less mountainous
In Madrid it's a complete different history, it is dry and sunny even when is cold
>I'm wondering: do you fellow Andalusians feel more connected to us Algarvians/people from Alentejo (Alentejians, I guess) than people in the northern Spanish provinces
I live by the very border, and no
I've crossed the border hundreds, if not thousands of times, and I don't get accustomed to how obvious are the differences in such a short trip
It's not that the difference is that huge, but the border makes them more abrupt than the gradual continuum you find when travelling all over Spain
I live in Valencia, so I would say the Cathedral of Santa María or the Silk Market
Either the [Farola] building at the center of town or the [city hall]
Yes, I live in a very irrelevant city
I'm don't live in a town, but the nearest one has part of an old medieval wall (with tower included which is used as a tourism agency) and  around it it conserves a lot of the original street layout
A famous castle, built in 1579 (during the rule Philip II of Spain)  over the remaining of a watchtower to fight the Barbary pirates
Nowadays I think more people think of the arts and science area
Well, currently yes, I would say that the arts and science area is more remarkable
its a small city with only 20k population in Galicia (northwest Spain)
you can find way better ones to visit like [Santiago] in there
The Spanish word for hammer is "martillo".
I guess it's subjective how bad-ass a word may sound to people
I don't know of other languages, I only speak English and Spanish and a bit of French (which I don't know what the word for "hammer" is)
In spanish it dont have that sense of power is just "Martillo" wich is pretty boring and standart
I had always feel that hammer is better specially warhammer
[Click to hear "martillo".]
Martell in catalan
Martell is how we say it in Catalan and martillo in Spanish
It sounds exactly like [Spanish for "they crash"] You don't get much more metal than that lol
In Catalan it's also very similar
'Martell'. It's pronounced more like 'mart-ey'.
Still it's a very little *marto*
I'd say "martillo" sounds pretty hard, I think it's harder than "hammer".
This one wins it for me
Finnish is a very cool language
In Spanish Carles Martel is called Carlos Martel, without translating the last name
I guess Carlos Martillo doesn't have the same ring
Martillear in Spanish, exactly same meaning
Is the "ll" always pronounced as -y in Catalan when it comes after a consonant
Depends if you still live with your parents or not
At 25 me and all my friends were already working but some of us were  living alone and some still at their parents
Us would save little to none while the others would obviously save way more
I'd say the average salary was between 1500 to 2000 at the time so I'd save around 200 or so living alone
I was living in London at 25, renting with my partner in a shared flat
I was saving around 400-500 GBP / month which was around 20-25% of my take-home pay
I'll be glad if I make 1000€ after finishing my master's degree
Same here and that's why Italy and Spain have one of the lowest birth rates in the world
What
Average
In Spain
Are we talking about the same Spain here
Or you mean average between you and your group of friends
As a Spaniard I feel this
You'll be glad if you find a payed job in Spain
This is something super important that we have to fix
We won't be able to pay our parents' pensions otherwise, but I've yet to see a single political party, from the left or the right, adress the issue
And there are people that don't want immigrants, smh
I joke to my friends that they better have at least two kids lol
Thank you for your comment, I was feeling poor
The French 25's in that comment is like the Spanish 30's (for an engineer)
That's because our economy has structural problems
Most businesses are too small to provide well paid jobs and if you check the average wage by sector in Spain, most people work in the sectors with the lowest average wages (mostly shops and bars)
In order to solve this, we need investments, especially in regions like Extremadura or Castille-La Mancha, which have left behind
But that takes long, we would see the results in 15 or 20 years, too complicated for our short-term mentality
Yeah, although that's another problem on its own
Covid has shown that we can't rely on tourism to sustain a big chunk of the economy
This doesn't have an easy solution, Spain has had a budget deficit and a lot of unemployment practically since the 19th century
Spain could become the Silicon Valley of Europe if only people realized we need big businesses to create wealth BEFORE we can have a complete welfare state
We got pretty good infrastructure and we were one of the first countries in Europe with 4G coverage, if we invested in the technological sector we could grant wealth and plenty of jobs
I think they will eventually develop a culture close to the original one of the people of that place
The North people will die of heat and dehydration and the south of people will die of cold and overhydration
Andalucia would want independence
A lot of southerners freezing to death because they don't have winter coats
Northerners not knowing how the air conditioner works
Then Catalonia will have finally lemons
(And Murcia will want to indepence themselves)
So, a disaster of biblical proportions
The main conflict would be *mini* vs *cachi*
Just imagine, Murcia independent again
No, but suddenly Spaniards are ok with letting Cataluña go
The near 1 litre plastic cups are usually called "minis" in the Center and South of Spain and cachis in several northern regions
There are more names besides those two, but they are the ones I'm the most familiar with, and I was just joking
Prueba sin la tilde, tal vez sea eso
In a couple o years
How are they called at your area
I find this issue oddly interesting
It's not accepted but it's really common among young people (both men and women) during parties
I have to admit I have done it many times and I am sure most Spanish would say the same thing
It's disgusting because it smells really bad and it's unhealthy for the people living in the area
Plus it usually happens on summer and the dry and hot air doesn't help
Just pee anywhere but like away from people no one really cares
Pero dnd vives me meo
On a night out in Spain everyone does it
>"No, it's fine bro, as long as your dick isn't showing people won't care if they see you doing it
Yeah well people do care, they won't say anything because people don't care enough to say something to 3 young guys probably drunk, risking being beaten up, but they care
I too though people didn't care when I was younger until I received a bucked of freezing water upon my head while peeing in the wall of a residential building
nunca has estado en un botellón?
Si bro, pero mear en la calle no es pa tanto lol ayer mee en la estacion y meh
I like mine al dente, but I don't judge
Except when I see people putting oil in the water
I do, but my wife doesn't so I never get to eat it lol
I like pasta in almost every way but ya, I prefer al dente
Viva Italia
I do this sometimes and a friend saw me once and looked at me like I was the worst monster to ever live
Tbh I have done this too with spaghetti while I wait the water to star boiling
Yo lo hago siempre
Mientras espero a que el agua hierva me voy tomando algun espagueti crudito
Supposedly they put oil to stop the pasta from sticking (which doesn't work either)
I've read somewhere that it can prevent the pasta from properly absorbing water, making it cook unevenly
It can even stop the sauce from properly sticking to the pasta
So it has 0 benefits, and some potential drawbacks
It's a big no
We don't sleep siesta often
Like, except retired people and some children, and overworked people falling asleep on the couch when they arrive home
Also, it's not always sunny/hot, we aren't the Sahara desert, it's quite cold/fresh all the year on many places
Add that we don't attend parties/traditions so often and aren't as lazy as people say, and we aren't eating stereotypical food (paella/tortilla/churros
) everyday
Eco friendly
Does conscription apply to women
Come on, you've got to hold your homie's hand once in a while bro
Most people I know sleep siesta if they have time for it
>if they have time for it
Exactly
I mean, it depends on who you ask
I'm a student, and sometimes people are so stressed that they take long naps weekly or even daily
Not everyone in my family sleeps "siestas", but a lot of them do if we have like an Sunday family meeting (after a big, three-course meal) or if their work schedule allows them to
We do eat dinner between 20:00 and 22:00, but we tend to go to sleep at around 00:00, though 2 am would still be seen as a normal, if rather late, hour ot go to bed, especially if you come home late or aren't a sleepy person
Crimes against humanity
Too strong flavour, it chokes any other flavour of the pizza
Just eat bread with ketchup, for that purpose
When I learned about spelling bees I was quite surprised
As you already know, in Spanish the concept would be pretty absurd
There are some weird words and some homophones, but the  spelling is pretty straightforward
In fact, reading is supposed to be obvious except for a FEW  exceptions, like psicólogo
I remember the exact moment It occurred me I would never be able to learn English spelling completely
I had been living in Ireland for a while and I had to read the word vineyard in class
I assumed it was pronounced vine-yard, because it made Sense
Why
English WHY
I know about them thanks to Disney Channel
As a kid I was confused because the shows were  dubbed in Spanish so I was like "this is really easy, why do they have these competitions
". It didn't occurred to me that the original show was in English xD so they started to make more sense when I grew up
It is not a big thing in Spain, but it does exist
I only heard it once during 3rd or 4th of secondary school (ESO) and at least my region has a "Concurso regional de ortografía" which translates to a regional spelling bee competition
As you say, Spanish is ridicously easy in that matter, so it has no merits being able to spell words correctly
I know about them from watching American movies and TV, as I’m sure many Spaniards do, but no, we don’t have them in Spain
As you well guessed, Spanish is a language where things are mostly written the way they are pronounced, so these contests wouldn’t make much sense
Sure, there are some weird spelling rules and people do make spelling mistakes, but the words where this happens are not enough to justify a whole contest about it
When I was a kid and I watched a spelling bee scene on a movie (dubbed) I was always a bit confused, since I could see the characters who were supposed to be the “smart kid” struggling, and I thought it looked so easy
Now that I know English, I understand
Yeah no, Spanish is spelled phonetically so there is no such thing as spelling bees
it blew my mind when I realized they were a thing in English
Actually, there’s a Spelling Bee in Spain
It’s called “Concurso Hispanoamericano de Ortografía” (Hispanoamerican Ortography Contest)
In 2017, I was the Valencian Community representant for this tournament, and there’s a representant for each of the 19 regions, and there’s a representant from the Instituto Cervantes (kinda like a Spanish international school); it’s organized by the Ministry of Education
It consists basically in writing down sentences with words you haven’t really heard and are very rarely used, or maybe foreign words adapted to the Spanish spelling rules (e.g. writing “zum” instead of “zoom”, or even “güisqui” instead of “whiskey”)
I ended up 4th :)
We do in Catalan, we had a prior TV program about it (el gran dictat) and currently we have "Pica Lletres".
As far as I know it doesn't exist in Spanish because it's very easy to spell words (we pronounce it as we write it) except for some words with h, v/b or j/g.
Never did, when i heard it happened in the US and the UK it was new to me
Same here in Spain
The only challenge spelling bee would have is knowing if the word has S/C or J/G
Let's remember that USA is the origin of shows like Cupcake Wars or Forged in Fire (sorry I don't know if these are the original names)
Its a country where they promote competitiveness and make a competition out of everything, even if it's knife forging or cupcake decorating
Stressful, isn't it
We do :)
En castellano, la Fundéu y el ministerio de Educación hacen el concurso hispanoamericano de ortografía; si quedas primero, te dan 1000€; yo fui por la Comunidad Valenciana y sí que había palabras chungas que no tenías ni idea de cómo escribir solo de oídas
I always found funny that because Spanish is a romance language some of those obscure loan words are surprisingly obvious to us
When I lived in Ireland my classmates would ask me how some words were spelled
Then I would ask them how to say water tap or how to spell borough
Oh no
very specific examples of words that most people will never heard or use in their lives
My statement is shatered into pieces
I'll be crying over that corner
Also, s/z is not an issue if you speak properly
To practical effects it IS the same
You write it as you pronounce it and the other way around, therefore it's useless to have a spelling bee
That wasn't my point, but how easily you turn anything into a competition (I really couldn't believe there was a show with judges judging people forging knives lol)
And I don't think it's a bad thing either, I'm just surprised because in my country we don't have such a competitive spirit
Right now the most watched competitive show on our TV is an island where they compete to see who can last the longest without fucking someone other than their partner or something like that
We have a few but it wouldn't be that easy for you
Basically because of the RAE (royal academy of the Spanish language)
The RAE an institution whose primary focus is to protect the Spanish tongue
They don't like complicated spelling (they had a feud with Mexico for years over the letter X)
Many words are instead  transcribed to Spanish pronunciation
Sometimes with hilarious results, like GÜISQUI
Guess which word is that
A spelling contest of english loanwords with RAE spelling could be tricky
"Wrong, it's CEDERRÓN"
Hahahaha, I would surely loosely
I'm against spelling GÜISQUI and JONRÁN on principle
We elect the deputies from each province to represent us in the Congress of deputies, each of them is from a political party, and then they choose the president of the government
closed lists
you vote for a list
the next head of the new government is in that list
people from that list vote for the next head of the new government
new government
its not that proportional
regionalist parties see their suppor increases than countries that go for all the countrie in number of votes per representative
Hahahaha
61 MPs -> 30 Ministers
Basically every 2 MPs get a Ministry
To (somewhat) fix that you only need to put a national threshold
You need to have, say, 2% of the total of national votes to even be able to get a seat
Then you can get your seat for some provinces
This wouldn't affect big parties like ERC or PNV but the ones that only have 1 seat would struggle
Imho all this 1-2 seat parties are way to many
Same goes for our king
He also sign laws and can choose not to do so
Iirc the law just goes back to parliment and gets approved there, the Senate has the same problem: laws need to be signed by them but if they don't they just go back to the lower chamber and get approved there
The system is kinda broken hahaha
There is no pressure because if there was there'd be mass suicides given our country's economy
In Spain young people often live with their parents until late 20s or early 30s, and it's not uncommon for unmarried people or without partner to live with their parents even after that
It used to be, nowadays our families are happy just with us surviving all we have to face
I think it is about Spain, and pretty accurate
**Andalucía:** You know the stereotypes about Spain in general
Well, is those but more intense
**Extremadura:** Mostly empty wasteland filled with inbred people
**Castilla-La mancha:** No one lives there
And a lot of Don Quijote jokes
**Madrid:** Narcissistic assholes
**Castilla y León:** Mostly empty wasteland filled with conservative people
**Murcia:** *This place does not exist, do not keep asking questions, you would not like what is in such place
**Valencia:** The land of paella, currently under Guiri occupation
**Baleares:** Currently under Guiri occupation
**Catalonia:** Greedy assholes
**Aragón:** A mostly empty land in which everyone acts like Paco Martinez Soria
**Navarra:** Doesn't have any
**Basque Country:** Superhuman beings that speak in an impossible to comprehend tongue
**Asturias:** Where Spain came from, very proud of it
**La rioja:** Wine
**Cantabria:** PRAISE LORD REVILLA, GOD EMPEROR, KING IN THE NORTH, LORD OF SOBAOS AND PROTECTOR OF THE ATLANTIC
**Galicia:** Shithole full of rain, bagpipes, conservatives, drugs, and people that refuse to give straight answers to questions
**Canarias:** A tropical place that never shows up in maps and has people with really weird names
**Ceuta** and **Melilla:** Full of muslim people
* Galicians: Naive farmers
* Andalucians: Lazy and extrovert
* Basques: Brutes and terrorists
* Catalans: Greedy
* Madrid: Proud & arrogant
Andalucía: lazy
Backwards crazy about bullfighting and religion
Catalonia: nationalist assholes who think they're better than the rest and hate Madrid
Madrid: posh assholes who think they're better than the rest and hate Catalonia
Valencia: pyromaniacs who make the only true paella
Galicia: gray skies, green land, seafood
This is where Gallicians are raised
Once they're grown they emigrate to Madrid and spent 24/7 speaking to everybody about Galicia
Castille and Leon: Conservative people
Basque country: super strong neanderthals who make awesome food and speak the black tongue of Mordor
It's a mystery how they reproduce since basque girls never let you get laid with them
Probably spores
Castilla La Mancha: depopulated wasteland which very rural manners and way of speaking
Have a hidden humorists factory
Canary Islands: brown but beautiful people that speak like Caribbeans and only eat bananas
Murcia: They speak the absolutely most bloody horrible version of Spanish (trough Puerto Rico and Republica Dominicana are strong contenders)
If their way of speaking was a horse, it should be shot down
Except in Cartagena
Aragon: Strong willed and stubborn
They speak funny putting stress on every sillabe (ZÁRÁGÓZÁ)
Asturias: Green
This is our reserve to start a new reconquista in case the arabs come again
Navarre: basically like basques
They created the San Fermin conspiracy to get entertained seeing guiris get killed by bulls
Cantabria: Green
Castillians who think they aren't castillians
La Rioja: wine
Extremadura: roman ruins, iberian pigs and nothing else
Balearic Islands: this is where we grow Germans
Navarre is basically Basque but they aren’t actually aliens
Me has matado con lo de Paco Martínez Soria, cabrón.
Valencians also go crazy at the sight of fire
>Mallorca: Actually germany
Hmmmm
Andalucia is still the best region
Yes
But is not really part of the standard Basque stereotype
British be warned
What's this Murcia you talk about
For some reason, they are both cheap and well made, so it's typical for spanish tourists to load on towels over there
They dissolved already, and we Basques are not proud of it
Murwhat
What's it like to travel for hundreds and thousands of miles and still see everybody speaking the same language, and the same restaurant franchises
Basically the same (but opposite)
If you are close enough to a border, it is nice to easily practice another language, get groceries you cannot find easily at home (or the same, at a lower price)
And overall you see that people from a different country are not that different after all
(at least in non-pandemic times)
It's great
You don't realise you're in another country until you hear the people speaking or have to read a few signs
I did my Erasmus in Belgium
Went to the Netherlands a few times to see some friends, went to Germany for the Christmas markets, to Paris and Luxembourg
I'm from Spain which is a big country and we only have Portugal and France which are a bit far from my hometown
So I never appreciated that opportunity until this happened
From where I currently live (Madrid) Guarda, Portugal is about 4h driving, and Baiona, France is about 5h. Capital city hopping isn’t all that viable: Lisbon is 6ish hours, Paris is 12ish hours, Andorra la Vella is 6ish hours, and Gibraltar another 6ish hours away
It isn’t much for US standards, but it’s enough for it to not be something you do on the daily for cheap gas or something
One of my best friends lives really close to the border between Spain and Portugal, on the Spanish side
Both countries have different time zones so she will often go to the shops in Portugal if in Spain they have closed for the day
She gets bread from a bakery in Portugal, goes to the dentist in Portugal and gets all the Portuguese channels on TV
She says it's lots easier now she doesn't need to keep different currencies in her house
I have visited often and it's pretty great but I often forget to change the language if we go to a shop or café.
Yes I guess we do compare to other country
I'm from the South of France and we always went on holiday to Spain
When I was a kid I had a week-long school trip to Rome
We had exchange student from the UK
Even as a broke student I was able to go to the Netherlands by car and camp in Amsterdam with friends
Or travel to Ibiza one summer
That's pretty cool
Or go on a roadtrip to some cool music festival a few countries away
It was still 20 hours driving so not sure it qualifies as "nearby".
As an adult I often travel abroad for holidays or to visit friends and family
Well Spain is a special case, we're not only big (for Europe) but also quite isolated
If you're in Zurich you can drive in less than two hours to 5 countries
If you are in Madrid
zero is the answer
I would say it takes about 6h for the average spaniard to get to France by car
If you live in Girona you're lucky, if you live in Huelva
you're in for 10h.
Most people take an airplane to go anywhere other than Portugal or the french pyrinees
That said, planes are absolutely great
Tickets are dirt cheap and flights very short
I used to travel to Europe about 3/4 times a year
Any low cost traveller knows the city of Bergamo, you can go there for 20€ from basically anywhere in the EU
We had trips to Morocco, Iceland, Italy, France, UK, Munich, Portugal and more it was really cool
>100km gets me to one neighbouring country, 200km to another three countries, 400km to two more and 600km to two-three more
For comparison:
100km gets me to zero neighbouring countries, 200 km to another zero countries, 400km to two more and 600 km to three more (counting Andorra and Gibraltar)
I lived once 20 minutes away from the Netherlands and my ex introduced me to cheap dutch outlets and vanilla vla <3
Absolutely every single Spanish house has [windows shutters] and I just can't understand how this is not a universal thing
No curtain, no matter how thick it is, can give the light, thermal, and acoustic isolation these shutters give
Maybe fans
The ones with the fabric screen and wooden frame
Not that we use it every day everywhere in Spain, but in the summer it comes in handy, and I think every Spanish family has at least one in some drawer
Persianas
Window blinds but heavier and they block the sun really well
They aren't very common outside Spain or Italy
A [holder for the jamon ] and a [specific knife for it]
[Paellera
I've had toasters like that for decades now
It's pretty uncommon in Spain, but my wife got one years ago and we found it so useful we've replaced it every time it's broken
The Norwegian cheese slicers are common here, but pretty sure you won't find them in every household
Conversely I thought that can opener was a universal thing
In Spain, by law, a house must have windows shutters
>instead of putting it in the trash where it may Stef to smell
Maybe you see so few of these in Europe because of the different plumbing
In Spain smelly trash is not a problem because trash is collected every single night
I was baffled when I learned this is not a common thing at all
Very common in Spain
The porrón is something we consider to be very Spanish, but it is so basic that it must exist in many other places
There in Catalonia and in the rest of the country also, in the whole spain we call it aceitera
In the night
That's funny, because I realised this was indeed not a common thing was the first time I went to Berlin
Something you can lift with two fingers or break with a punch is not meant as a security device, and they are meant to be used mostly at night, not to block sunlight
If you just want to remove some sunlight, we have curtains too
Both bidet and moka machinez are very common in every Spanish house
True
I think it's a Mediterranean thing, sunny places after all
It may be mandatory by law here to have a bidet too, they're everywhere
I recommend you to visit other countries, I have several boxes in my kitchen as everybody
I actually confused the porrón with la bota, ignore me
But yeah, it is used in the rest of Spain too, not just in Catalonia
Have you never seen it in other parts of Spain, or have you never been outside of your region
(maybe you are very young
> Glad you guys in Spain also make use of it
Lol
Sure they are
Total darkness and noise and temperature insulation
No, it isn't. It's just cultural
I just bought a new flat and they give you the option but it isn't mandatory
Definitely seem them outside of Catalonia but for the places where those can be useful (outside work) botas are definitely more common (less fragile, better cooling)
Many people can't sleep otherwise
I had a GF that had to put a towel covering the gap under the bedroom's door and even made me to put the mobile phone facing down the table because the notification LED lighting the ceiling would wake her
The term Hernitcraftlike comes from a YouTube series called Hermitcraft, it's a smp (survival multiplayer)
And it's composed by a few youtubers (iskall85, Grian, Docm77
So It would mean a survival multiplayer server
I would really love to see those recycling machines in supermarkets where you put in plastic bottles and get some money back
There's nothing like it in Spain if I'm not mistaken
A better bureaucracy, Spanish one sometimes sucks a lot
[These patterned sidewalks omnipresent in Portugal (and former colonies)]
Lived in Poznań for a year and now I terribly miss public transportation, buses and trams (loved the tram system)
You don't have night urban buses in here, at around 23 you have to take a taxi if you want to return home
And they're not cheap
And also bus schedules between cities are awful, and if you live in a city under 30k inhabitants, forget about train station and assume you'll have like a bus twice a day and not even in time
Oooh, the farm code in Germany, where people from the countryside leave pumpkins, eggs or whatever they produce leave the goods up for sale and people just pick them up and put the money on the mailbox
There used to be, back in the day :(
Edit: for glass, not for plastic
>here in germany where governmental retirement schemes pay so little that it's possible to work a fulltime job for 40+ years and still having to collect bottles during retirement,
Are you kiddin' me
The bidet in my former house was the fountain for the cats
In my current house, I removed it when I remade the bathroom
That' wasn't a thing in Spain until COVID
Cash payment were discouraged and everybody accepted this
Before this, I only used the debit car to pay for fuel (yummy discounts), but since then, the only cash I've used in a year is for the coin-op car washing machine
>You don't have night urban buses in here, at around 23 you have to take a taxi if you want to return home
Poznan Has 500000 inhabitants
In Madrid we also have night urban buses, where do you live in Spain
>also bus schedules between cities are awful
And terribly expensive
Exactly
I was shocked when I found out that one can buy tobacco at supermarkets in Germany, and I began questioning why one can buy alcohol at supermarkets in Spain
The Bottle Deposit Scheme in Germany is a mess
You need space at home yo leave the used bottles, remember to take them with you yo the supermarket, if you don’t have a car it’s absolutely tedious to carry them with you every time you go to the supermarket
And bottles with Pfand are more expensive, it’s not like if you got money from recycling your bottles: you hire their bottles
It’s far more convenient to recycle your plastic
Yeah, but's still a nice way to encourage recycling
I'm from Spain where pay to use bathrooms aren't usually a thing and I'm a bit torn on the issue
On the one hand I appreciate not having to pay just to pee here
But on the other hand I appreciate not needing a hazmat suit to use a public toilet like in other countries
>Did not expect to hear that about Athens tbh
have you been there
There's an important dissonance between Athens and what people think Athens is like
Well maybe it was a bad comparison
I live in Galicia, and not even Vigo has night bus
I find that a way worse solution than just encouraging card payment (and the more modern systems) everywhere
We too went through rationing after our civil war (and for many years after, honestly) and it didn't change our food culture to bland unsavoury food
I highly doubt that's the reason
Many countries went through that or worse
Also many countries use internal organs and cuts of meat and still get many savoury recipes, we use them [too]
We have showers down here, you know
Not that it's excusable, but Vigo is half the size of poznan
Maybe it's a bad comparison, I don't know the polish public transport system
Yes, in Germany
You shower every time you shit
Well
Of course it's a hyperbole :), but Athens gets really bad
way more than people expect
I think beans and toast are one of the least unsavoury food that you have there, honestly
You're talking about meat cuttings and offals which honestly can be used in delicious food
You also have potatoes, radish, parsnip, berries, etc
so it isn't as if you live in a  desert
I've tried your Sunday roast and it's amazing, you have enough to create good dishes
Anice stew doesn't need much
Do you have bowel issues
No, but I don't always shit at a convenient time for a shower
The city center has lots of narrow streets and some buildings are litterally like 500 years old and dont even have elevators lol
In Europe a building from 1880 is nothing special, please don't be offended, I just mean it's really common to have older ones
There are cathedrals from the 1200 and they're really incredible buildings good maintained
And also if it does happen the wall won't collapse like it was made of papier-maché
Lately, a lot
Specially from the left voting people
This happened in our regional elections this year
For the generals you can't vote a regional party becuase it would just split the vote and give PP more seats so people vote either Podemos or PSOE, albeit reluctantly
When the regional elections came around nobody voted for Podemos and PSOE is not even 2nd
Also back in the day, where the parliament just was 2 parties + regionalists and nationalists (where absolute majority was achievable for those 2 parties) you just voted to avoid having the other party in power, as there wasn't such ideological variety in the parliament
We have some really shitty left wing parties
I mean
there isn't that much variety now either
You have PSOE+UP or PP with either Cs or VOX
Where I live only PP or PSOE get seats and I won't risk my vote
People, that voted for them, say that with the other party it would have been worse
I'm not really sure
On one side the right likes money and closing restaurants and tourism wouldn't be great
On the other side they are more authoritarian so maybe they wouldn't be so opposed to lockdown
Note: the opposition will always be against what the government is doing, even if they probably would have done the same if they were in power
The Autonomies are the ones that did most of the heavy lifting during the pandemic and the colours of the local government didn't influence too much how it went
There are legal procedures that only central Gov can do and some Autonomies have practically begged that they needed a lockdown and Madrid said no, worst case is in one of their own Autonomies (governments are from the same party) that now has 400 to 450 of cumulative incidence
Easy
Healthcare is run by the regions, not the central government
So you can always say it was the opponent or another party who did it bad in their regions
To be fair, as the situation and measures was different in every region, results are varied
Partially because the government itself finances those election polls, but there are other reasons
You'd be surprised how fanatical spanish voters are, and how corrupt the system can be
Bullfighting in Spain is, luckily, getting more and more unpopular and I think it's bound to disappear or at least stay just as a tradition without the current cruelty (avoiding the bull, veronicas and that but not killing it slowly)
The same for every animal abusive local tradition like El Toro embolado, which I'm not sure if it's already prohibited tbh
Also, the population is getting less and less religious and some festivities are losing weight, like midnight mas on December 24th, or the different saints days and the saints in general
Others are still relevant but lost some importance due to foreign traditions spreading
For instance, a lot of people share presents on December 25th instead of traditional January 6th, people celebrate Halloween instead of November 1st, but those still hold relevance nonetheless
Almost all religious traditions related to Catholic saints are disappearing, unless they are accompanied by a feast day and are an excuse to get drunk
For example, last February 3rd was San Blas's day, who is a medical saint and his [bread rolls] are supposed to protect you from sore throats
This year it was my turn to buy a bread roll for my grandfather, and he told me that in the old days grandmothers used to take their grandchildren to buy bread very, very early in the morning and then go to the church to have the rolls blessed, tied with cotton threads
Then they would make necklaces out of those threads and wear them throughout the month of February to protect themselves from sore throats and colds
My mother remembers doing that as a child with her grandmother and I didn't even know that was the full tradition, nowadays it's the bakers who take the bread to be blessed in church (if they get to do it) and then sell it in the bakery and thats all
With a bit of luck, Toros
Already out, throwing a goat from the bell tower to celebrate something
It is turning out ok
Bullfighting in many areas of Spain has already disappeared and rightfully so
If it wasn't for the bunch of rich bull breeders with political contacts and huge public funding it would have desappeared everywhere decades ago except for a few places such as San Fermines
\> midnight mas on December 24th
I always find it full of people, but maybe it's because the Sibil·la concert we do in Mallorca
In Spain the "three wizard kings" traditionally brought  presents
Nowadays Christmas is slowly but surely gaining territory
However "kings day" is still pretty important in Spain
You'll see nativity scenes around the country and many kids get their "strong" presents the 6 of january as opposed to Christmas
My town is actually famous for its real size nativity scene
Edit: "three wizard kings" is what we say in Spanish (tres reyes magos)
In English it's the three wise men
It gets even more interesting when you do it with Italians because they start with the opposite cheek
Can't count the number of times I've kissed random Italians on the lips by mistake (while not being drunk)
I never heard of the pins tradition (it looks painful
) and I don't know if it has to do with San Antonio, but it is common to celebrate "your" saint's day, it's like celebrating your name day basically
As you said, it's a second birthday (usually without gifts) and mostly celebrated when there is more than one family member with the same name
I only found out as an adult that the kings are not actually wizards (magos), they are called Magos because they were Zoroastrians and Magi were the "class" these kings belonged to within the ranks of Zoroastrianism
Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
In English they call them The Three Wise Kings/Men
It didn't work well for us, did it
Legislation is always a step behind social changes
I think it was declared inmateiral world heritage by the UNESCO some years ago
>I only found out as an adult that the kings are not actually wizards (magos), they are called Magos because they were Zoroastrians and Magi were the "class" these kings belonged to within the ranks of Zoroastrianism
Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
That's fascinating
And I bet it is related
>In English they call them The Three Wise Kings/Men
I'll change it ;)
> Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
Yes, that is interesting
As you said Magi was the Persian Zoroastrian clergy
So as Greeks interacted a lot with Persians in history they took the word as a loanword
Later it would pass to Latin and we get nowadays Mago in Spanish
As Zoroastrian religion had a heavy imagery based on the sun and fire, over the time the word switched to be related to supernatural elements and we got mago /magia
Fun fact: when Al-Andalus was raided by vikings for the first time, Andalusí people called vikings "al-madjus" (the fire worshippers) because they were pagans and used lot of fire
This came too from Persian "magi".
Yeah, in Catalonia
I haven't seen one in my life, don't know how common it is
Real size
Nativities In Spain are usually miniatures
Like [this]
Thanks for the explanation
This is my town's ["monumental" Belen] for comparison
"I Danmark er jeg født" ("in Denmark I was born") is the no
1 patriotic song in Denmark
Some people (me included) think it should be the national anthem
The lyrics were written by famous writer H.C. Andersen
I will translate some of it:
> In Denmark I was born, it is my home
>There are my roots, there lies my world
>You Danish tongue, you are my mother's voice
>So sweet and blessed you reach my heart
>You fresh Danish beach
>Where ancient burial mounds
>Stand between apple farm and hops garden
>You're the one I love
>Denmark my fatherland
A fragment of the third verse also sums up the history of Denmark pretty well:
> You were once the ruler of the North
> You prayed in England, now they call you weak
>A small country, and yet around the world
>The song and hammering of the Danes can still be heard
In Catalan I would say that this s song is very well-known and loved:
[el cant dels ocells ] (the song of the birds)
And also [l'estaca] (the peg) with lyrics about Franco's dictatorship but nowadays used as an independence song
Basically it says that if we all fight for something we can achieve anything
The peg is something that keep us tied but if everyone pulls it will eventually fall down
For my country, (Spain), I would have to go with “concierto de Aranjuez” which is a classical composition heavily based on guitar, because I think it is internationally known as a Spanish composition and personally I feel like it represents musically our very diverse culture and landscapes
If I had to go for a “song” instead of a composition I would have to go with Mediterráneo by Serrat because of the same reasons but with the catch that it represents mostly the Mediterranean part of our culture which is not so influential on the rest of the country especially in the northwest
[This one
I'm from sapin]
"En livstid utan krig" then haha
Actually not a lie
just the opposite
The river Guadiana in southern Spain comes from ana (pre Roman for river)
Later, when Arabs invaded, they named it wadi Ana (wadi meaning river in Arabic)
So when you say "river Guadiana" you are literally saying "river river river"
"pueblo de islallana" (village of the flat island) also called the village of the 3 lies, as is isn't a village (legally it's another category), isn't a island, and isn't flat
Maybe not incorrectly but in Spain there are some weird names, like Ultramort (Ultradead)
The town is small but it is not a dead town
We also have Peratallada, which means "cut pear" or "slashed pear", but the place is not important for their pear-slashing culture (at least that I know)
Spanish explorers calles nevada like that because all the mountains with snow on winter
Also Santillana del Mar (Holy Flat from the Sea)
It's neither holy, nor flat, and it isn't by the sea
Oh yeah and Puertollano, the town of the 2 lies: not a port (puerto) as it's in the middle of the mountain in centre of Spain, and not flat (llano) for the same reason
not in al-andalus arabic ;)
&#x200B;
Actually almost every river in souther Spain start with wadi (Guad-)
There is no basis, period
National and regional languages will still be taught in schools, and there will still be a whole apparatus of public and private media, cultural institutions, etc
, that will promote those languages and cultures
For starters, what would the homogeneous language/culture be
People complain about the "4th Reich" and how Germany dominates Europe, but fail to realize that German speakers are less that 20% of the EU population
And they are the biggest language group
How are they going to impose their culture over the other 80%? How is any other, smaller, culture going to impose itself over the others
At the end of the day, there is no basis to believe that a federal Europe would harm our cultural and linguistic diversity
On the contrary, a European federal government that cared for, protected and promoted the national cultures (and it would to those things, be us, the citizens, would make sure of that) could be a great help to them
From unity comes strength, and you can do much more when you represented 500+ million people than when you represent 20
Case in point,[the EU is forcing streaming platforms to produce local content] which is surely good for our film industries
Does anyone think that, say, Portugal could enforce this regulation effectively on its own
>Therefore I wouldn't not like to pool my electoral power with them as they have very different interests to my own and may support laws which are not desired by my country
Tbf that happens inside every country too: the interests and decisions of certain regions can be detrimental or go against the will of others, just look at Brexit or the US elections, to name a couple
Well, catalan is an official language in Catalonia, (almost) all school is in catalan, if you want to get a job in the administration in Catalonia, you must know catalan, etc
Catalan is not in danger at all, or at least not more than it has been ever
It might not be promoted outside, but it's definitely protected inside Catalonia
As for culture, each region has its own holidays in which they celebrate their days, and on its own way
There are a few national days off, and then each autonomous community has its own own set of days off for that reason, so I don't think that it's specially in danger for that reason
It is true though that maybe some other minor languages like euskera or gallego etc are getting less use every generation
... except that regional languages are promoted and protected by their regional government, taught in the schools, and cultural productions in those languages is encouraged
You hear a lot of talk about how supposedly cultural minorities are mistreated in Spain, but, are there many European countries who can claim to have 5 official languages (with one or two more to probably soon come)
> One thing that could happen theoretically is that say 1 million swedes,  for some reason, relocates to estonia for example
And the same nr of  estonians to other countries
What is then left of estonia
The Estonian government would still be there and teach the children of those people Estonian, would demand knowledge of Estonian as a requisite for working for the administration, etc
In a couple of generations, you have a culture that, sure, hybridized with Swedish culture (if the influx of immigrants is a big % of local population), but is still recognizably Estonian
> Why do you hate you country so much that you want it to disapear as sovereign and have no longer power ?
For starters, because "national sovereignty" is a fucking lie
Please ask the Poles how national sovereignty worked for them in 1939
Or to the Belgians in 1914
Or to the German when they were partitioned after both World Wars
Or to your own country when Napoleon was deposed
Or to any of the Eastern Bloc countries, when the Soviet tanks came rolling in
Chile after Allende was elected, Iran after Mossadeq, etc
I can keep giving you examples if you want, by the way
No, "national sovereignty" is a lie that only only works for those who are strong enough to support that lie with hard power
If you are weak, those who are strong will respect your sovereignty only in so much as it fits with their objectives
If you are strong, then you can make yourself and your sovereignty respected, and force others to do what you would like
And I hate to break it to you, but: European countries, today, are weak
All of them
None have a fucking chance against the USA and China
And we all know the ways in which those two erode our sovereignty
So, it's either work to become stronger together and piece together our common sovereignty, or just disappear into the tomes of history as just another American pseudo-vassal
And by the way, I don't hate my country (I love my country and am proud of being part of it), just because I have different opinions on what its future should be than you have for yours
Thinking that only those who think like you love their country and everyone else hates it, is bullshit nationalism
> A vote with 40 million people, you have very more power than a vote with  500 million people who have not the same political interest as you
Don't worry, the [subsidiarity principle] comes to the rescue
Just as the French government doesn't decide upon your local garbage collection, the European Parliament won't either
Rather, the European Parliament will decide on those things which are so far detached from the citizens' day-to-day life that a lower representation ratio is acceptable
Things that don't affect you as directly mean that you can form broader and bigger political coalitions with others, and those coalitions will ensure your representation and your voice being heard
For example, in European foreign policy with respect to Russia, there are likely going to be 3 or 4 positions, at most
No matter what you think on the matter, you will find someone that supports that position
> Shouldn't the Constitution of the Weimar Republic prevented the takeover
The Weimar Republic had a lack of democratic culture and a lack of tools to protect their democracy (for examples, Hitler was able to easily suspend constitutional guarantees following the burning of the Reichstag)
They furthermore had to deal with the ascendance of fascism, which was even more dangerous then than it is now, because back then it was a new phenomenon and nobody knew what to do (well, within democratic bounds, that is
> The fact that 'currently the EU had a veneer of protecting national  culture' does not mean that once power is centralised that those  policies will remain eternal
Why do you trust the British government to protect your individual rights
It does now, and it has in the past, but why do you extend that to the future
Probably it's a combination of "I trust my democratic system and its protections", "I trust my fellow citizens not to stand that bullshit if it happened" and "I don't fully trust them, but recognize it is better than anything else".
Well, the same things apply here
With the added advantage that, since we would be building a new Constitution and government for the European Federation, we would have the chance to create a system that could assuage all our doubts and set up barriers to ensure those things are not breached
For example, write in the federal Constitutions that "the right of the member States to educate their children in their national language(s) shall never be infringed", that "the member States have a duty to safeguard their cultural and linguistic heritage for the future, and the federal government has a duty to aid them in it", that "the member States have a duty to have a public broadcaster in their national language(s), and invest X% of GDP in culture", etc
And then make those things into hard-coded parts of the Constitution, so that it is nearly impossible to change them
Hell, we could even have the recognition of the right of a member State to secede, as a last-resort measure if they feel the federal government is overstepping out of control
But at the end of the day, the best constitutional protection there exists is us, the citizens
So long as we truly believe that preserving our cultural diversity is important, we can make it happen
And I honestly think that would be the case
People care about their countries, regardless of their position on the European Project
So I would feel perfectly comfortable in trusting ourselves with that, along with some constitutional provisions
>It comes from a distrust of where things could go once that power is centralised, not how things are right now
I think a certain level of distrust on institutions/politicians is healthy, so long as you channel it into asking yourself "what can I do to improve the system to solve/mitigate that distrust". And as I said, I believe we perfectly could achieve that, just as the American Constitution managed to solve their own issues quite well, for example
Yes, of course
I think it should be done like it is right now with catalan
Every language should be mandatory in its region, just like now, and maybe make English co-oficial and make it like Spanish is in Catalonia now: we have a Spanish class 2 hours a week up to secondary education
But I think this is already a thing in most Europe, so it wouldn't be a problem
Of course we'd still have people trying to make those languages less relevant, but it can't be helped, there will always be people like that everywhere, sadly
Well, the post was talking about language, culture, literature etc
So I assumed you were talking about that
"Having a hard time" =/= "wanting independence". They can argue in favor of independence if they like, but they are NOT "having a hard time".
Sure, but again, I think you underestimate the capacity that a dominant culture has to assimilate others
Unless an overwhelming majority the population of Estonia is new immigrants, I don't see them displacing the local culture
Mixing with it, sure, but not displacing it
And honestly, that's good, since a culture that does not change over time is one that is dead
And if an overwhelming majority of the population of Estonia were new immigrants
well, sure, there might be some problems, but what's the chance of that happening all of a sudden, with no time to assimilate them
Like, sure, if I leave my house I might get run over by a car, but that doesn't stop me from going out to work/study
Same with this
Aww, thank you, I love you too <3
> Because we have a system which has been continuous for 400 years, mate
We are in the top few most politically stable countries in Europe
... and Brexit is showing precisely that
> I choose not to pool my democracy with countries which have only been  countries (let alone democracies) for a few decades
No thanks
That's your (elitist and arrogant) prerogative, for sure
> The EU is too much too soon for me
The EU is not changing to anything until the citizens decide to do so, but if you don't like its current state, sure
>  I don't trust the people who would be writing it that they would do so  with the protection of the interests of the individual nations
Why wouldn't you trust them
They would be citizens of those same countries, representing their citizens
They are not aliens sent by who knows what to destroy the European countries
They would be citizens not any different from the current MEPs or folks at Westminster
And they would be subject to the exact same democratic mandate of every other political representative, they wouldn't get to do whatever
So, really, why the distrust
> I'm glad we're out and good luck to the EU
Why, thank you, good luck to you with your "global Britain"!
But again, what are the chances of one million Swedish immigrants moving to Estonia
How would those immigrants live there, where would they work
And why can't that happen now
And why do you assume we would do nothing if that happened
Again, yes, we can set up the worst scenario possible and say "huh, how would you solve THAT
", but that is pointless because if you set up and unbelievably harsh scenario, then no shit that things would get bad
The only sane way of doing this kind of speculations is with reasonable and plausible, not arguing about what would happen if a million Swedes randomly moved to Estonia
"Well, if the world ended then that would surely fuck up your democratic system, so I think we should stay with feudalism"
> Compare that with what has happened in your country in the last 100 years and it seems little greater than a family squabble
I'm not saying the opposite xD God knows we are a mess of a country, but we take it with humor xD
> Are you stating there aren't dozens of constitutional matters that the  citizens of the EU would reject if put to popular vote
That's brave
No, I am stating that if we made a constitution from scratch today, the citizens would be decently happy
There would still be disagreements and compromises to be made, but ultimately there would be a nice thing coming out
Of course people don't like X or Y from their constitutions, but that's because political mentalities change with time, while (unreformed) constitutions don't. If we made a new one today, it would be closer to what we like today than the current constitution
> I don't believe the European Commission is solely interested in what the people of Europe want
You can choose to believe that (I personally think that Commission staffers have personal opinions of how things should be, like everyone else, but that's it), but the issue is that the Commission is not deciding anything, and never has
It is just the go-fetch-me of the Council, and little more
The Treaties only name her the "guardian of the Treaties", it has no other authority by itself
> Sylvio Berlesconi is just a citizen of his country
So is Viktor Orban
Both were democratically elected but not people *you personally* would like writing your Constitution
Sure, but you wouldn't (or I wouldn't, anyway) want Farage or Rees-Mogg writing the Constitution either
My point was that people in your country are not (generally) any more good or bad for Constitution-writing or democracy-keeping than those in other European countries
> The European Commission is not elected by the citizens of Europe
I have  very little doubt the people like Ursuala von der Leyen and JCJ will be  the types actually writing it
Again, for some reason you believe that a body with little real authority and power would be writing a Constitution in a fictional Convention, instead of elected representatives
And by the way, the College of Commissioners *is* elected
by the national governments
If you dislike that, and would like a more direct election, then I suggest you join the campaign of the European Movement, the European Federalists and others to have the Commission directly chosen by the European Parliament :)
> I just do not feel part of a European Demos
And that is entirely fair enough, and a perfectly valid reason for not wanting these things
Of course I feel different than you, but again, it is totally understandable and respectable
It is not a stupid question at all
In Spanish 90s usually people worked 9-14 and 5-8 or something like that, so there was full rest periods, but no free time
With the europeisation of the work schedules, is way more common to rush 8 hours straight and heat some food at lunch time
I personally prefer the European schedule, it unlocks the afternoons to develop hobbies and personal life
Sometimes yes, sometimes not
I’m a student and my official timetable starts at 8am and ends at 8 pm
There are free days but there are also days where you can’t even stop to lunch calmly
Workers in Spain complain about the split timetable: it is common that office and shop workers make a long pause at middays, and that makes that they work somewhere between 8am-6pm
People ask the government to regulate these horrible timetables so that people can spend time with their family, have free time, etc
Yes I have time for that but not so much for other things
I enjoy cooking in the evening so we always have a proper dinner with my girlfriend
For lunch I usually take 1h break and I either cook or eat leftovers (I make sure to cook more for that)
I also try to go to bed early but I live in Spain, and the curfew will be gone in a few days so we'll be back to the late life
I enjoy the late culture but I like to sleep
Since I started my remote job, I feel like I have much more time to enjoy the routine
I agree
Luckily this situation is changing in most office works
I had a job where I was working 8-13 & 16-19
It was hard, on mid-day I had time to go back home, make a good lunch, take a nap and go back
But that also means 4 displacements, two for going to work and two for leaving, means half an hour or two on the car
Per day
If you are 30 minutes afar from your job
And supposing that there is parking available
It does not adapt to city life at all
So that’s basically like revetlla de sant joan in the coast of Spain
We have the same tradition in the day of San Juán (Saint John)
It is actually an ancient pagan tradition that predates the saint name
Oh, I thought it was older
But it's on the 24th :(
Spain is really diverse so it's very difficult, if not impossible to say
Ceuta and Melilla seems like the most obvious answer since they are in continental Africa, but I haven't been there so I honestly don't know
Other than that, I don't think something like "normal" Spain exists
If we talk about extension, maybe one could say the north is more heterogeneous despite being smaller than the middle and southern regions in extension, but I feel like it's stretching it too much
If we talk about the stereotypical Spanish flamenco
olé, then Andalusian culture is the stereotypical Spain, but that's just the external image
I don't think there's such a thing like "normal" Spain, there's a huge diversity and that's one of the things that make this country beautiful, in my opinion
Canary Islands because they are in Africa and not Europe, therefore the climate is so different, and people's accents
Completely agree with you on everything
I agree
Spanish cities can have very different feels depending on the region but all feel very Spanish unlike maybe Ceuta and Melilla like you say
If anything there are some places like Perpignan or Bayonne that feel like they could be in Spain but only because they feel (and are) Catalan and Basque
I would say Cadíz definitely has a 'Latin/ Caribbean pirate town' vibe to it
I mean, I suppose that's because it's one of the oldest inhabited places in Spain, but still - I felt more like I was somewhere in Latin America or the Caribbean there
In fact, Cadíz has stood in for Havana in movies before, such as [Die Another Day]
That, or certain areas of the Canary Islands - those feel more Latin American to me as well
Madrid is ugly
Man, you need to visit Madrid again, it is fucking beautiful
>Maybe Barcelona the less Spanish because of how it's built
What do you mean
If you're referring to the squared street structure, there are many other cities and villages with the same pattern in Spain
You've visitied very few areas then lol
Cities and towns in every area have their distinct colour mainly because of the local stone or the tones of paint traditionally used in facades in the area
Idk, most Spanish towns and villages are white like this
>The size of Amsterdam however means that there is plenty of non-tourist city centre left, most notably De Pijp
Don't go around saying that too much or we tourists we'll find out about it and take it away from you like the rest of the centre
It means native population has stopped using their local language (Low Saxon) in favour of Standard German
Well, in Andalucía, not in the rest of Spain
To each their own, I guess
These ones are not fromAndalucia, yet the facades are painted white
Spanish absolutely should be
Mainly because learning other languages is hard
Because English is the lingua franca and most Europeans already speak it
I see no point in Spanish being the lingua franca when we already have English working fine
It'll be a waste of resources to put everyone to learn Spanish for replacing English
Plus points: We actually have one phonem per word
Minus points: Grammar
It should be Interlingua
Basically automatic to understand for Romance language speakers, probably it just takes a couple months to master it, and easy to learn for the rest
\-The UK is not part of the EU, no reason to maintain English
\-Super simple and consistent phonetics (it's almost one letter = one sound and that's all, no weird or random sounds, no clusters of silent letters, etc
the few exceptions remain consistent)
\-the áéíóú are not extra letters or have different pronunciation, the accent is there just to indicate the stressed syllabe
So learners have it easy to know how to say the words just reading them
\-Plenty of people already speak it outside Europe (even in the US there are plenty of speakers), so it's useful
\-Only one weird extra letter to learn (for no Spanish speakers) and that letter is just an abbreviature from latin (the scholars writing books abbreviatted the "nn" present in latin texts into "ñ")
I support languages where the spelling matches the pronunciation
**So you guys you can chose between  un caffè al mattino or vámonos de fiesta
Well in europe is a minor language with litle relevance so that is enough to say that it shoulnt be the european language
I would be fine with that
The phonology is almost the same as C
Spain Spanish
A lot easier to pronounce that French or English xD
And the soft d....
I still have nightmares about trying to pronounce the soft d.
Spanish from Spain is heavy in blasphemy too
One of the most common words is "hostia" (communion wafer) and expressions like "me cago en Dios" (I shit on God) are common
The selling point of Spanish is that our pronuntiation is straightforward, what you see is what you get, if you know how to read it you know how to pronounce it and we have the easiest vowels, just 5 of 'em
We even have grammar rules to let us know which syllables to stress, it's THAT easy
Mostly for us
French: the language with the most outdated and nonsensical spelling system after English
Makes sense
we don't even know how to conjugate verbs properly so we can't expect other europeans to learn
I was thinking “only 1% of the population speak it as the first language,” that _cant_ be right
then I remembered that the UK isn’t in the EU anymore
usually i only understand 100% to non native speakers hahahaha
Nah, if everyone learns Spanish, they can half-speak Portuguese and Italian
You don't have to
Most spanish speakers don't, they do the opposite
Half of Portugal lives in Luxembourg already so you'd have an advantage
(We want to keep the fun for ourselves)
Sure, but French outside of France was really only spoken by a small educated elite
Diplomats, nobles and scholars spoke it, peasants and workers just spoke their native language, French was useless to them
English is now taught in most school systems, and hundreds of millions of normal people have learnt it because of the economic opportunities it affords in a globalised economy and the spread of English language media
Yeah, better to be prepared
But I think that there is a difference now that back then there was not
English has been spreaded far more through the world than any other language has been before
And we are also far more connected
With this I am not saying that English is not going to be replaced eventually, but that is going to take a lot more time to happen so
If Latin stayed with a strong presence for a few centuries even after the fall of the Romans, with the poor communication between communities and the relatively small (compared to the magnitude of English today) number of people who could speak it and the low literacy; I personally think that English is not going to be replaced as the lingua franca in my lifetime
Moreover, in my view, the language has become a tool of international communication rather than a language that will fall when the superpower that made us start to speak it does so
But as you said, better to be prepared
Just in case
That's our politicians
You guys should revive your own language, is dying
And, well, Malta, the whole island, has the population of a city
It has no weight (and they also have Maltese) in this debate
Have everyone learn Basque, since it has no relatives at all in the world
It was a joke
were indeed not expected
"Hey guys, how about we let that french dude march here so he could take Portugal
Everything from 1700 to nowdays I'd say
What do you think about Napoleon invading Spain
It was a war of attrition that tied a lot of resources, for actually little gain since Spain was already fighting on his side

¿Nieva en La Concha
It has gone lower, but it's extremely rare around here
Yes, once in a while
We don't know where a surprising number of our cities names come from
For example, Madrid and Barcelona both have unknown etimology
However my favourite is this one
You know how the Abbasids dethroned the Umayyads in 750
Well shortly after (756) a blond guy found its way to iberia with an army stating he was the last Umayyad, Abd Al Rahman
He came to "inherit" Al Andalus and proclaim independence
The thing is
we don't really know for sure how the prince escaped or how he ended in iberia
In fact, we're not absolutely sure if he was really who he said he was
What we know is that he was a key figure in Spain's history
An amazing king without whom Spanish history can't be understood
Why the Muslims did not conquer the peninsula in its entirety and, moreover, they did not advance further north than the Duero River, which leaves enough space for the Christian kingdoms to have a good space with countryside, mines and forests to have resources to establish themselves
Also, the name Cedric exists only because Walter Scott misspelled Cerdic
honestly the myth for the flag is pretty standart i had heard several abaut, batle blood and then boom new coat of arms
also you could had been partners with the spanish empire if phillip II achieve to have a son with your queen that strange time
And the funny part is that most of his family was slaughtered by the Abbasid in a dinner very similar to the red wedding in Game of Thrones
The legend says that he was protected by his mother's Berber tribe in the Maghreb before going to Al-Andalus while the rest of the Ummayad in the middle East perished
So you say Scots-English-Romans instead of Rock-Paper-Scissors
>Why would the last Kharazmi Shah order the murders of the mongol caravan
,  don't caravans mean business
He thought it was a spy mission posing as a caravan, trying to prepare the ground for an invasion when the Mongols were done in China
So he nipped it, confident that the Mongols would be too distracted with the Chinese to react
Little did the fool know, the Mongols would invade Persia and China at the same time
>Why didn't Yazdgerd retreat the way The Bizantines did from the Arab  invasion
If the Arabs didn't succeed Iran would be very different,  perhaps Zoroastrian, having our own alphabet, being very distinct from  the rest of the middle east
Wait he didn't? Wasn't he killed by a thief in Afghanistan or something like that
And his son fled to China and became a nobleman there
Or you mean a more orderly retreat, setting up defensive lines somewhere
Some centuries before, Roman empire started conquering Hispania in 218 a.C and the didn't finish conquering the Basque  region until 19 a.C. It took two centuries
So that part of the country was always hard to conquer (reason why Basque language survived and other pre-roman languages didn't)
I guess they are some good mountains xD
As far as I remember, it means land of castles, curiously, the same as Castilla
This is bullshit
I went to public schools and there was much more time on the Muslim conquest and the Caliphate than the Visigoths and roughly the same as the Romans
And from everyone I've read until now, Andalusia gives them more time than other regions, not less
Probably
He was offered to have the white flag as his royal standard and keep the tricolore as the national flag, as a compromise, and he also said no
And when he died 10+ years later, an old drawing of a compromise tricolore with the Bourbon arms in the middle was found in his library
Most likely, he was open to accept the flag before 1871; in 1871, however, he didn't want to become king, but he didn't want to be the one to turn down the offer either, so he pushed the flag demand in order to force the government to turn him down and not the other way around
Well that explains everything
Yeah, tbh his life is ripe for a Hollywood movie
I can't believe he's been so ignored
From Syria, so not only Muslim but arab
As for his hair colour it's well documented
no, sorry jejeje
they didnt even reach that mountains, they didnt even conque the whole sub-plateau north
they didnt pass in that zone further than what is call "Sistema central"
The PM of a country with sea-going crocodiles, sharks, lionfish, ring octopuses, cube jellyfish, Steve Irwin-killing stingrays, went for a swim in the sea and never came back
It must been a Chinese sub
We are long due for a Spanish series on the Visigoths and the Caiphate
Unfortunately studios are reluctant to get in the Middle Ages and when they do they actually don't care for the history and just repeat tired tropes
I thought he was redheaded but maybe I'm confusing him with Tariq
"Land of the Goths" makes the most sense, it was one of the first places settled by the Visigoths and that they ruled the longest
Plus, the Franks coopting the local Gothic elites in the 8th century and allowing them to have their old Gothic laws in order to make a common front against the Muslims
Didn't your kings historically style themselves the king of the Swedes, Goths, and Vandals
Three crowns would be an ovious reference to that
I know Abd al rahman III had blonde redish hair
I couldn't find tariq's hair color
Abd Al Rahman I was blond I couldn't find any mention of redness
Was it Ostmark before Osterreich
Or the other way around
Most words in English that come from Latin sound really impressive for English natives
I tend to use those ones a lot because they're the ones more similar to the equivalent in my language, so they're really easy for me, while natives tend to think they're hard
I once ordered food in Hebrew, and the guys were shocked
I barely speak it, but apparently I’ve got a proper tel aviv accent
Another anecdote: was going to pick my tray from McDonald’s, but the worker dropped the Fanta and splashed a bit on me
She kept saying sorry and was very ashamed
I noticed that she was called Daciana and I said “Sunt bine sunt bine” (Romanian)
And she really got happy, but really really happy
And finally, at a coffee shop in London the waiter was called “Xavier Perello” (obviously Catalan), so I just said common expressions and he got really happy
As a Spaniard I hated phrasal verbs, because they are hard to memorize
So I usually learned a synonym
Some British people were surprised I knew some of them because they were considered too formal or technical for casual conversations
The point is the more formal or technical an English text is, the more Latin words are present
making easier to anyone whose native language is Spanish, Italian or Portuguese
*¡Que te folle un pez espada, con la punta bien afilada
(Get fucked by a sword fish, with the point well sharped
I have always found Celta's crest to be a bit dull
Maybe it's the colour scheme
From Spain I like [Albacete] and [Betis] signs
Definitely [this] (or something like that)
Generic and good vibes
I think it fits my city
Some soft Spanish guitar
Not something very energetic
A very relaxing melody
The kind of music you don't even notice its playing on the background
Nope, it's the background music what I wanted to post
Siesta time
Territorial stability :D
Siesta as worker right
no worries
Spain here, say bye bye to your record
2 years without a real government (no laws passed)+ 3rd year with 3rd elections, baby
I came here hoping that the top voted comment for Spain was not "siesta". I would propose other positive things we have and others might not know: live expectancy (2nd in the world behind Japan) or how positive or open we are
Glorious mi amigo
But you will miss on all the fun
Spanish hospitality
If you say "level of corruption" you're kinda implying there's some
You could add "or lack of thereof" to make it a little more clear
You're right but I'd say it still gets your message across better if what you're doing is discussing the high integrity swedes are regarded with
Idk it's not a big deal anyway lol
I'm not sure of the exact definition of "entitled" and have never heard of "helicopter parents"
Otherwise we have ***niños mimados / niño de mama*** \- pampered children / mommy's child
I lived 5 min walking from the Plaza de Toros de Sevilla and I have never been there
I used to be able to see the [Royal Palace of Madrid] from my old apartment (since moved to a slightly different area of the city) and I've never been inside
Of course I've been in the courtyard between the palace and the cathedral 1000 times, and walked in front of the palace through the gardens, but I've seen several other palaces around Europe, and I doubt the carpets, suits of armor, artwork on the walls and antique furniture are *that* different to make it worth waiting in line for
Maybe one day I'll go if I have a visitor who wants to see it
My ex lives less than 1 hour from Sierra Nevada's ski tracks and had never been skiing, which is specially weird because she's totally into rollerskating and extreme sports
I've always suspected she has some secret childhood trauma about skiing
Due to COVID lockdowns, I started to do some hiking in the forests and countryside around my hometown, and I've discovered a number of hidden small gems
This kind of stuff makes me think how inadvertently stubborn we can be
I live in Aranjuez (south of madrid) and I’ve never been to the palace, even tho its free on wednesdays
I live in Madrid, but never went to the royal palace
Ironically, I've been in in the royal pañace of more than 4 other countries, but not mine
Can confirm, I've never been to sagrada família either, it's just so turisty and at the same time so available that you just don't care
I've been to parc Güell a few times though, mostly to show it to outsider friends
That's the problem with Barcelona, I avoid it at all costs now and when I do I prefer to visit less touristic areas
I went for free two years ago
Sometimes they make a weird promotion/event where it's free (I think that you have to be from Barcelona's metropolitan area)
I don't remember the exact conditions but it was fast, no queues (you have a turn), 0€, it was nice
First time being there too in my life
I think that they do it in winter too, so there's tourist but not that many
But well now it's close anyway
Yeah, I meant the same, actually going in Sagrada Família
Of course I've been in the area and in front of it like a thousand times but I never paid to get in (there's a free day but gets incredibly crowded)
I have visited Parc Güell before they changed it (you didn't have to pay before)
Then maybe it's just with a DNI, I don't really remember the details, buy anyway it's the best way to visit if you're not a tourist
Spaniards do we have something for this that I'm not aware of or we don't at all
I'm from Spain and I also use one Mississippi, two M, etc
Your influence has been great so far
count from eleven hundred:
mil ciento uno (1101), mil cientgo dos(1102), mil ciento tres(1103)
(that is how I was taught how far a storm was, in seconds between lightning and thunder)
Nah, I count in seconds, somehow I learned the pause to make between numbers
Not in school but at home my parents taught me to count using thousands (mil uno, mil dos
Elephants, dear
1 elefante, 2 elefantes, 3 elefantes
I use Mississippi to count like in the USA, but I don’t know if that’s the majority here
I thought about it but then later I realized that I probably did it because of the song "Un elefante se balanceaba por la tela de un araña..." and so on
And I don't think that song was made for timing, but maybe I'm wrong
Yeah my mother taught me the Mississippi thing, but none of my friends knew that so idk
Well that could be a reasonable explanation, I never thought of it
I just tried it and it is quite accurate
Who knows
In Spain: Medicine, Mathematics, Physics, Computer science, dentistry to some degree, some engineerings, agriculture science
The worst: History of art, psychology, Spanish or English literature, education, sociology, or similar
Maths and Computer Science are very demanded right now
Other STEM degrees are also needed
Medicine or nursery have also good prospects
Well,i'm studying math and everyone is SO EAGER to tell me that it's a VERY usefull degree (i sincerely think they can't think of anything good about It Other than that), so i guess study math
The cut-off Mark has been rising like Foam the last couple of years and for the first time ever we're seeing recognition in Spain, a country with so much math legacy It could outweight half a nail
That's how the education system should work
Here we have It all mesed Up,
> wasting many years of your life to get a Masters in engineering if you don't give a shit about it and you suck at math
This IS SPAIN education system in a sentence
We have the same problem here in Spain, you'll have way more problems finding a job with some engineering degrees than with a plumber trade
Medicine and nursery are perfect to work abroad but here the situation in general isn't that good
Lots of temporary contracts that brings you uncertainty and economic insecurity
I would like to add statistics degree and actuarial science, I worked a few years in HR and recruiting these kind of profiles and they get a nice salary
Nice to know
I said that before that those degrees should be very selective and let in only elite students in fewer universities
We still need Historians of art as researchers, museum curators and such, but we don't need SO many
I love art but if I want to learn about it I can read books, watch documentaries or attend conferences
I remember being at the University of Granada and seeing History of Art classes with 200-300 students, makes no sense
Yes, but we don't need so many
There are 12000 unemployed psychologist in Spain
Sounds like hell, but im glad it all worked out
not in Spain, if you don't have a degree you can be the BEST in the world and still don't get the job
I knew a Guy Who had 25+ years of experience in his sector (IT related stuff) when he was cut down
He didn't have a degree
It took him 7 years to find a job
That's a good question
Most of those degrees are majority women, so it doesn't help them bridge the salary gap with men and female graduates have more unemployment and precarious working conditions, including working on things completely unrelated to their degrees
Medicine is also majority female but does not have that problem
Most of the high unemployment rate in Spain is because of the high proportion of school drop outs, nearly 40% of the workforce does not have any professional qualification
Spain has a very rigid and academic school system that does not provide solutions for students that are not suited for that kind of education, particularly makes from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
These students see there are work opportunities in the hospitality business, construction or agriculture and give up on studying
We also have in Spain a very high rate of student retention (repetition) that demotivate students and ends up being a disaster
The education system needs a total reform to provide individualized itineraries for students so they can achieve at least a basic professional qualification
Not everyone wants to be an academic, but as soon as you say that, a lot of people complain
There is also a lot to be done about businesses in Spain not wanting to spend anything in research and staff formation, they are very conservative and don't want to invest money in order to get more later
Well, the cronic unemployment of Spain IS very linked to the black market, a significant amount of people in spain work while "unemployed". Mostly in the agricultural sector
and the conditions of some of this "Jobs" are Really terrible
Search for Jornaleros if you want to know more
STEM
First to know IS that Spain has always sucked at science and math, they didn't have any type of reputation and It was even looked down upon
Most science majors ended Up as proffesors and the college system in Spain IS a semi-corrupt pudding, full of limpets Who Will retire when they're 85
However, there are a few science majors in the private sector
Math had It even worse
until a decade ago, math had a 5/14 as a cut-off Mark with about 80 students per year in the BEST colleges
that should tell you about how prestigious It was
Basically you studied math to become a teacher or a proffesor
This IS rapidly changing though, with math getting an umprecedented amount of attention, we have a 13/14 as cut-off Mark now
everyone is talking about math as the promissed land, but they've probably hardly ever meet a spanish mathematician
Engineering by contrast was pretty revered a couple of decades ago, so much so, that everyone got into engineering and after a couple of decades we had so many engineers they couldn't find any Jobs (yeah engineers were unemployed, yikes)
Today hardly anyone gets into engineering
it's a really hard degree and you have fierce job competition from every side
Technollogy has had a few nice decades and it's starting to take flight, with a miriad of students per year (lets Hope they don't end like engineers)
It also has a pretty good reputation
This IS also by far the degree i have less info about
So our E started soon and died, our T is promissing and Will probably implode under it's own weight, our S has a seemingly sane development with PLENTY of job opportunities
mainly out of spain, and our M was meager until 10 years ago and it's now exploding at forced marches
In conclussion, we have an uderdeveloped STEM, prone to explotions in popularity with very little lasting job demand for It
In words of my stepfather, we have now more forestal engineers in Spain that what We'll ever need again
In Spain choosing subjects outside of the scope of your degree is very strange
Most of the students in those courses, such as medieval art, or ancient art were History of Art undergrads
I don't think in the modern world universities have the same importance in spreading culture than they had even 40 years ago
Knowledge is more available and if you're curious there are many ways you can learn about things
If you want to do like in the USA where the first year of college is about the experience and trying different things that's fine, but spending so many resources in training history or art, or philosophy majors in a country like Spain with so much unemployment is not reasonable
Yeah, but we are dedicating public resources to hobbies
There are more things in life than what's practical, but there are ways to learn about something outside of the professional environment
Oh yeah, these are not medically trained and if they want to be clinical psychologist they need to do a master and some more testing
I agree with everything you said
I am entering my second year of college and I see so many people being unmotivated and putting leisure as a priority (partying all the time)
There's too many students and not nearly enough job opportunities that are worth it
Plus, a lot of people like myself need to go work / do internships abroad if they want any chance at success in their field
It's very sad
Yeah, but there's a Big difference between Spain and Germany, you have a work oriented education
For example it's not strange for a German to go into job training instead of college
in Spain it's still seen as a joke, something shamefull
Yo see this degrees as smth to do in your fifties, in Spain thats not how It works, few people ever go back to college
Art and history are full of people Who expect to live out of that degree, they study for profesional reasons
the thing IS there's no need for so many
Spain IS a country where knowledge IS venerated and practicality IS ignored
It's a Stark contrast with Germany where practicality IS always one of the goals to achieve
In Riofrio, Granada it is produced one of the best caviars in the World
>The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
You mean the *merienda*?
>The amount of rice we eat compared to other European countries and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
We cook rice like that too but we don't eat it as much as you guys
I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
>I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
Here it's an hour
>I think it kind of sucks but I suppose it's better that way in the long tern
When it was banned here people were PISSED, and it was the only thing everyone talked about
It was forgotten in no time, people got used to it and now when I go to a place where they allow to smoke (Like in some little town in the middle of nowhere where law enforcement turns a blind eye) I find it disgusting
That's very typical in Spain and it had to be regulated because of "overpicking" lol
We do that in Spain
I live in the uk now and whenever someone asks me how do you eat a particular thing, the answer is inevitably always “with bread”.
Even Chinese restaurants will offer bread and wine
You mean fried pig skin
In Spain we call them cortezas, they’re pretty common (we eat pretty much every part of the pig, nothing goes to waste)
In the uk they’re called pork scratchings, they’re a common pub snack
I can't tell you when was the last time I had soup
Okay, I don't particulary like it so I probably have less soup than the average Spaniard, but still
You mean within Europe, don't you
East Asian countries mist consume and produce it way more
Yeah, that’s how we do it in Spain too
We have those in Spain too, we call them garrapiñadas
Occasionally I’ve seen them made with hazelnuts too
In Spain it's merienda
Smoking outside is allowed
Smoking areas indoors were allowed for a brief amount of time, but it's been illegal for years
So like pork sashimi
we have it in Spain :D
Yup, raw pork is a no from me
You keep talking about the Inquisition and forget about how we collapsed native American civilizations and had a Fascist Dictatorship until 1975 okay
Andorra has been traditionally a hive of smugglers
During World War II they offered safe passage thru the mountains to jews fleeing occupied France, but once in the middle of the mountain they killed them and stole all their goods they carried
I'd say that is pretty well known at this point
Switzerland has much darker stuff though
Because no one considers Balkan countries innocent
Well, each of the 17 regions have autonomy
They have their own parliaments, enact their own laws, and have control over most of the matters: Education, Healthcare, Universities, Environment, Culture, Rural and Maritime matters, Industry, officiality of languages, regional infrastructure, some of them (Catalonia, Basque Country and Navarre) have their own police forces, Catalonia has control over its own prison system and Civil Law
There are matters that strictly belong to the State, though, like Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Energy Policy
Aragon, Valencia, Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia and the Balearic Islands also have their own Civil Law
The Canary Islands also have their own police force, while Galicia, Andalusia, Aragon and Valencia have autonomous units within the National Police
Welcome to the group
May I present our 17 Autonomous regions
We ocasionally call our system "asymmetric federalism".
We would have to fight back the invasion and win again
No Catalonian nor Basque nationalism probably
We would talk shit of the French government though
We'd be half invaded by the French, in the middle of taking Spain back
Well, definitely the Spanish economy would be better
Ah shit, here we go again (*grabs blunderbluss, grows awesome sideburns and hides in the mountains*)
Oh, no
That's how it all begin
Part of it (where I live) would be French, the rest would be a puppet state
Catalan independence problem would be France's problem
Well, it's a long story but basically Spain betrayed Portugal letting France go through spanish territory to invade Portugal and when France was already with his army inside Spain, they betrayed Spain and the spanish King was overthrown in an army coup
After that Spain fought back for a few years and finally won the war
I guess this was divine justice for our betrayal to Portugal xD Sorry bros, our king was an asshole
More like a cultural trait we share
We couldn't betray Portugal if we weren't allies, not even friendly neighbours
We were enemies with Portugal too
It was French-spain vs England-Portugal-Prussia
The last good Spanish leader died about 4 centuries ago, ita hard to do it worse
But we, as a society, are as bad as them
We've proved that during the last 45 years of democracy
Not only terrible monarchs, they were cowards and traitors
I cant believe a descendant of those pieces of shit sits on the spanish throne today
Well, I guess if you're comparing Spain to 90% of the world we're doing good, but compared to the rest of Europe we could do way better
Mate, I had an English teacher in highschool who wrote several times New York with a j. New Jork
New fucking Jork City
Granted it was not a bilingual school but you're doing alright, trust me our English education is based on repeating the verb to be and hope for the best
Yes, in Spain apricots, and most fruits, are eaten "raw" (I really don't know if that's the best word to describe it)
Sorry there must be a mistake
At 11:45
I look at my clock again
I went into the bar 15 minutes ago
After 4 bears
about anything I find near
Usually pizza
At 11:45 people just finished dinner
You still need some hours for getting drunk
I'm just not too imaginative
At 3AM kebab/shewarma (or kebab meat with fries and sauce)
If it is a special long night, then some churros at 8AM
I rush back home through the deserted streets in panic over a potential hefty fine
It's 45 minutes past curfew
I live in hell
Six *cubalibres* and it's 8 AM you say
I'm gonna go ahead and get some hot chocolate with *churros* with my friends before we all head to bed and sleep at least until 3PM
How so
You are served with "free" food with your beer in most decent places around here (it isn't the same in all of Spain)
Here in Andalucía every beer comes with a tapa, so if you are still hungry, just ask for a fifth beer, or maybe for a 1L jar which comes with a set of different tapas
Pfff dear god, should I change it
Or just leave it as it is
Let's be charitable, maybe 4 beers = 4 litronas
Surprisingly I'd say we too
Actually we sometimes eat some churros too
I always order it a bit bigger for the next day
I know I probably won't be in the mood to even put together some milk and biscuits/cereal
I do not know what is the most iconic of Spain, but these three are really famous:
— La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
— Plaza de España (Seville
It appeared in Star Wars II, it was Naboo)
—The Alhambra (Granada)
Just from Rome I'll take the Pantheon dome and the Colisseum, but Italy has so many buildings across the whole country that is hard to choose just one
If Freddie Mercury had wanted to buy my parliament building I would brag too
Being the background picture in many versions of Tetris helps
Not a building but if I had to choose a switz landmark I would say toblerone mountain .
Who would've thought that after all the shitty things we did to you, your iconic building would be built under the spanish monarchy
Could It be also Palácio da Pena
Edit: so apparently, the Belém tower was built way before Portugal was inherited by Phillip II
The construction finished in 1520, 7 years before the monarch was born
>Spain: Sagrada familia
Yeah
nope
it's kind of problematic
Spain has many cultural regions and giving the priviledge of "the country's building" to any of them would greatly upset the rest
No building can represent all
Even in the same autonomous community this could lead to problems
Castilla y León for example, there's the  catedral of burgos and the catedral of leon
let me explain
the rivalry between castilla and León IS so pronounced that there's no official capital
50 years into the democracy
This kind of thing repeats again and again even in the same provinces (for example Murcia, where there's a rivalry between Cartagena and Murcia, the city)
Sagrada familia IS specially a bad idea because it's very catalan from it's inception
Many will say It  should only represent Catalonia
If i had to choose La Alhambra IS a gorgeus place and (i think) waaaaaaay less problematic
It turns out the Elizabeth Tower is the same as the Big Ben:
As for the stave churches, I had never heard of them, but I've just googled it and I love them
Yeah, totally agree
Yeah, i've discussed several times this issue with my family and Friends
and we always get to this conclussion
That I did not know
>Palácio da Pena
I'm going to edit It, thanks
Huh, you're completely right
Do you want me to erase It, so nobody picks Up the false fact
>but more about what building foreigners first think of when they think about that country
I think not, read the question again
It's what people from the country think, not foreigners
It says:
What's the defining building of *your* country
Edit: Ok It can be read either way, didn't realize till now, that's a bit confusing
I would say the sagrada familia IS what most foreigners think of when talking Spain, but at the same time i wouldn't call It a defining building
So did I.
I'm probably moving away from the original question, but everything I'm reading seems so "alien" to me and I'm so jealous that I want to comment
Here it isn't very common to use a bike to move around, although it is a relevant sport, many people have road or mountain bikes and cycling clubs are very common
Cities have been trying for years to become more accessible to cyclists, but this is proving to be ineffective: bike-lanes either lead nowhere or share space with buses and taxis
In addition, there are no bike exams like in other european countries and, in general, there is no respect between drivers, cyclists and pedestrians (drivers+pedestrians vs
cyclists)
In addition, bikes are an object of desire for thieves: leaving your bike on the street, even with a chain, is in some places dangerous
When I moved to Granada to go to university I wanted to use a bike to move around the city and thus save money on transport
I left it in front of the supermarket, in a central area of the city, with a chain on, and in the half hour I was inside it was stolen lol
It was my first week in the city and everyone advised me not to buy another one
In 2017 the city council hired 1000 bikes for rent and basically most of them were stolen or victims of banditry and in 2018 the service stopped working
>Mountain bike
>The Netherlands
Barcelona resident here
It used to be like this, but fortunately things are changing fast
For this nice transition to happen, improvements in the bike-lanes infrastructure have been absolutely key
Bike thieves are still a problem everywhere, that's for sure
Regarding number of users, [not just Barcelona, but Madrid also seems to be another place where the numbers have grown drastically over the last years] Of course there's still a lot to be done, but I'm pretty sure there're more cities in Spain following the same trend
We're still far from places like Amsterdam or Copenhague, but the number of users are going up everyday and [COVID-19 seems to be helping a lot as of late]
Don't listen that guy, the meat thing is a big lie, also we treat dogs like a member of the family not like in other countries
Sounds more like a Western thing than something uniquely European
True, or just meat
All of them except from the Napoleon occupation I think
If we consider "free" to be living in some kind of constitutional democracy, the First Republic lasted from 1873 to 1874 before the monarchy was restored
The Second Republic lasted from 1931 to 1939 until it lost the civil war
The current constitution was ratified in 1978 after Franco's death and is in effect currently, although this time we still have a (very limited) monarchy
218bC - 476 aC part of the Roman Empire
476 - 711 Free
711 - 1492 conquered by the muslims (although by the year 1150 half Spain was already free and by 1300 90% of Spain was free)
1492-1808 Free
1808-1813 Napoleon's brother betrays and invades Spain
1813-2020 Free
Yeah exactly lol not occupied either but
"married" let's say
You can tell who controlled the country from within or from a foreign land though
During the Roman Empire, it was controlled from Rome
During the Muslim Invasion, it was controlled from Bagdad (at least until year 929 when Al-Andalus / Emirato de Córdoba declared their independence from Bagdad and became el califato de Córdoba instead)
During Napoleon's invasion it was controlled from Paris
The visigoths ruled from within, were born, raised, and died here, didn't pay taxes or anything else to anyone outside Iberia, the muslims had their leader in Bagdad until 929 when Abd ar-Rahman III proclaimed himself Caliph
The muslims were accepting orders and paying taxes to Bagdad
The spaniards during the Roman Empire did the same to Rome, and during the Napoleonic invasion did the same to Paris
Spanish kings nowadays don't, even if their lineage is french
But whatever, I'm tired of this discussion, if you want to believe that spaniards have been free since 1492 be my guest, and if you want to believe that they have been free since the roman empire I won't argue with that
Almost every single city in the UK
Idk why but i expected most of them to be beautiful since they were such a rich nation for centuries
Barcelona
Warsaw and pretty much anywhere in Poland aside from the hotel I stayed at since it just so happened to be one of the 10 locations around Europe where FIFA 13 was debuting ahead of release and Robert Lewandowski and a bunch of Borussia Dortmund players who I loved at the time there promoting it
Bruges
Glorified theme park
No soul to it  Long queues
Tourist traps wherever you look
Expensive
Small
Ghent was 100 times better
I hear a lot of people giving it a lot of shit but I actually liked it very much
I'm not a big fan of Paris either, but partly it might be because of bad experiences I had there (like getting lost and missing a train for example)
I've been to Paris twice, once when I was 10 and the second one when I was 20, my experience was much better the first time
I can’t say anything about the others, but I didn’t like Paris for other reasons
I knew it has changed over the years, not a problem for me, but I didn’t like the people, the unsafe feeling all around the city, the huge amount of shell games in the streets, etc
Technically "Big Ben" is only the bell inside the tower, which is named "Elizabeth Tower"
And imagine how disappointed someone would be arriving [not having realised it's being restored]
Everyone shits on Athens, but I really liked it when I was there
What other places do you recommend in Barcelona
I'm Spanish myself but believe it or not I've never been
I plan on going for a couple of weeks, perhaps more, depending on Airbnb prices
I've heard awesome stuff about it even though it's so touristy
Also lately there are many news about street thefts, some with violence, which gives me some doubts
I've only been in england and in big cities
Idk, i kinda expected more from a country with such heritage and empire and all
It's my fault i guess
Nope, is it nice
And i guess they weren't rebuil in the same way
Idk i just expected more
That's the word
Bland, boring, samey
Yes, totally
But idk, being the capital of a hugely rich empire I expected more
But that's just my fault
Oh, ok
I didn't know
What exactly consitutes the old city
El Raval and The Gothic Quarter
My (very raw) plans are to stay in Gràcia
I've heard it has a nice atmosphere
That's the Uk I was hoping yo see when i visitted tbh
Georgian style, maybe some medieval here and there
But i saw too much 60's architecture and ugly limitless brick terrace houses
None of those, but i get what you say
There very few nice looking new parts of cities yeah
Also i hate those thousands of red brick terrace houses haha
But that is just personal
I don't know
I just expected that a country like the UK wpuld have been more careful with their heritage but after a war that's what you get i guess
I understand that after a war the most important thing is to house the people but come on
Aren't there any new plans to rebuild all that stuff
I've been to london, bristol and sheffield(visitting a friend)
And yeah idk, i just expected more from a metropoli like london
Again, i liked it, i just thought it'd be nicer looking hahaha, but anyway i had a great time
Nobody would be surprised, everybody drinks cheap in Spain
That's why the streets of Madrid have become a rave of drunkard foreigners while we Spaniards are locked in our houses, unable to visit our own family because it is forbidden to go to the next province but for some reason it's perfectly fine to take a whole plane to vomit on our streets
You probably would get a "caña" (a 200ml tap beer)
It is between 1 to 2 euro depending on the part of Spain (maybe more in touristy places)
It's absolutely infuriating
[They're ignoring curfew] they're not wearing masks, they do not respect social distancing
They can do that in their countries too, they just don't want to face the legal consequences
They come here to do "ilegal" stuff that puts us all in danger, but it's not their country, so they don't care, they gather their shit and go back home without a single worry
In Spain, at least in my school, we talked mainly about Rome and Carthage, and briefly about ancient Greece
However and unfortunately, it was quite brief compared to modern history
IIRC, in high school we had like one chapter about Carthage an Rome, one about al-Andalus, and the rest was modern or contemporary history
Amazing empires and cultures like Sumerians, Parthians and Persians, China or India are not even mentioned
Not even Egypt I think
Cyrus, Xerxes, Dario
not even mentioned
And I'm not sure about Alexander
If you ask me, our curriculum is extremely flawed and ancient history is extremely underestimated
We did talk about ancient Jews and the tribes of Israel, but maybe it's because mine was a Catholic school
Ironic, we talk about Moses and Aaron but not about Egypt
Fenicians Ejiptians Greeks Romans Celts, Iberians, and the diferent people of the zone of Masopotamia
Romans greek egyptians aztecs incas mayans and some of mesopotamia
In religion class babylionians assyrians and persians are mentioned as well
None :'v
except for Romans Greeks, Egyptians and (a bit) Babylonians
Not the most original choice
History is underrated af in both my countries
Celts, Greeks, Romans
thats about it for basic education as far as i remember
others might be mentioned but not taught
More or less is the same in Spain, but add Carthago (Cartago Nova is the current Cartagena), with Hannibal crossing the Pirinees to attack Rome, and the Phoenicians (Málaga was founded by them, for instance)
And before all of them there was Tartessos, but we do not know about them
We did not study Asian cultures (China or India, for example)
Nowhere near that here
Rome is barely a couple weeks, maybe
ROME
For us, Rome is the base of our culture, language, law
More than a milennia of civilisation = 15 pages of content
Bravo
Absolutely, there was even classic lathin as an optional subject but no Greek
I remember having literally one page about Greece at school, and 0 at high school
We learned more about classic Greece in Philosophy than History
I see it actually changed a lot with LOGSE
We studied the Greeks, Romans and a bit of Egyptians, Babylonians etc at 6° EGB, which would be equivalent to 6° Primaria  age wise
Did they focus on Spanish history on the the years before 4° ESO
I know, it's amazing
I even think that your average Spaniard is able to name more Visigoths kings than Roman Emperors
And we had two of the best
I don't really understand it, al Andalus and Rome are probably the brightest part of our history, but we spend all the year with nineteenth century and Habsburgs
I really don't get it, maybe it's a way to make us feel more patriotic about Bourbons or something, I don't know
If I'm not mistaken, which I can be because it's been some years for me now:
2º ESO: one page about Greece, one page about Rome
3º ESO: I honestly can't remember
4º ESO: Universal History, but ancient times were nowhere to be seen
A lot of Illustration, French Revolution, nineteenth century revolutions, socialism, Russian Revolution WWI, WWII
1º BACH: More or less the same as 4º ESO I think
I remember because I had two different teachers but I think the curriculum was pretty similar
2º BACH: Good' ol' History of Spain for Selectividad
We call it "hache" and it's silent
Our letter J has the H sound, and we don't have J sound
In Spain, the letter H has no sound
For example: It's the same to say Hola (Hello) and Ola (Wave), the pronunciation is the same :)
I find it very curious that the opposite phenomenon happens in Spanish
Our "c" sounds like a "k", while the h softens the consonant (Ch, like the sound for "much" in English)
Edit: letter C actually has a lot of phonemes associated, so I removed vowels in the examples to avoid confusion
It's silent unless preceeded by a "C" like in its name, then its pronounced \[t͡ʃ\]
Actually in it's name you find both forms as the first one is silent
We do have the English J sound, in LL and Y, I think
I think J and Y sound a bit different, they don't have the same sound, but yes
We actually use “Ya” to say Yes in some especial situations which is pronounced like “Ja” in German
I have some preferences of course but I think every country has something worth visiting/experiencing
Belgium, I will never forgive them for embracing Spanish terrorist fugitives 20 years ago
Here we say la conchinchina, that is a place in soth-east Asia
We also have:
"Where Jesus gave the last shout"
"Where the wind u-turns to get back"
"On the fifth pine", sometimes made vulgar ("on the fifth cunt", and so on)
Apparently "[the fifth pine] was a lover's lane outside Madrid in the early 1700s.
"In the Cochinchina", which comes from the mid-19th century [invasion of Cochinchina]
Several involving "[the place] where Christ did X". The original was "where Christ shouted three times" in reference to a biblical passage but over time it became "where Christ **lost** X", and there are [several versions in Spain and Latin America] each with a different item: "where Christ lost his sandal", "where Christ lost his hat", "where Christ lost his lighter", even "where Christ lost his poncho" in the Andes
In Spain we say "en el quinto huevo/cojón", which means "on the fifth testicle".
En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme
In Spanish we sometimes say “eso está en Mordor” (that’s in Mordor) As default you are always in The Shire
Tombuctú in Spanish, same meaning
Other common choices include:
* [Pernambuco]
* El quinto pino (the fifth pinetree)
* Donde Cristo perdió el mechero (where Jesus lost his lighter)
* A tomar por culo (?)
Also: Honolulu and La quinta China (the fifth China)
The origin of "El quinto pino" is quite curious: in XVIII century, a series of pinetrees where planted in Madrid from el paseo del prado until nuevos ministerios (a pretty long distance) and people used them as a reference for meet ups (we meet at the first pinetree, or the second, and so forth) so the fifth pinetree was the furthest one
The lighter can be changed for some kind of shoe
A vulgar variation is *en el quinto coño* or *en la quinta polla*. In the fifth pussy or in the fifth dick
No, we don't haha
Yes, al Congo Belga
Estar en el Congo Belga sí lo decimos
I heard it before but the others are more frequent
No yeah, we participated in one of the wars
That's why we use it
El coño de la Bernarda,
población: 48 millones
*jaja
Nunca lo había escuchado
Porque eres persona joven
CoFFFFF
A guy asked me for directions to go to the guggenheim museum while being in a completely different city 300km away
At first i tried my hardest not to laugh but he then realised he had it mixed with the Niemeyer centre which was still in another town but 20 min away
We were having our traditional Basque festivity, in said festivity the city is visited by our Farmers that, normally, come with their Oxens as by culture, the oxen is a very respected animal here
Our bulls are very big and Oxens are even bigger and by bigger I mean those are some fucking beasts but gentle gigants at the same time so people from outside the basque country (including other parts of Spain) freak out when they find themselves face to face with two super buff bulls that weights up to a ton in the middle of a crowded street
That day (some years ago btw) there were a big concentration of international tourists and they all gathered around the oxens
There was a small group of germans/swiss or Austrians, theybwere accompained by another small group of Spanirds and they kept asking if they could touch them, when they were given a yes, they started peting our good ol' oxens and giving them food
Once their "i want to pet this dangerously looking animal" thirst was satisfied, one of them came back towards the oxens
He deadass slaped one of the oxens, turned towards his group and the spaniards and shouted:
*this bad boy can fit enough germans to invade Poland*
I laughed like the dumb basque I am, it was so random, I was so unprepared
When I was 18 I worked at the beach in my town in Catalonia, Spain
I had a couple from Madrid congratulate me on my flawless Spanish after learning that I was actually born in Catalonia and hadn't moved there recently as they thought
Thank you, I guess
I wish that were us
They probably wanted to get them from the (usually illegal) resale
An English guest at my hotel kept talking to me in Italian, even though I barely know two words of it and I always answered him in his own language
I would be even more bewildered if not for the fact it was not the first (or second, or third) time someone insisted on using the language of a country a thousand kilometers and one sea away from here
I hadn't heard of it, but I don't really watch the news a lot, I just visit an online newspaper
They had an article on it but I missed it
Yes but it wasn't an important event
In Spain you are allow to use violence for self defense in a proportional way and only when someones integrity is at risk
For example, if you get robbed and the thief runs away, you can't shoot him because no ones integrity is at risk
But if someone tries to rape you and you smash his head with a rock and the guy dies, then that is allowed because that saved your integrity and there was no other way you could have think of
If the guy doesn't die but it's knocked out and you continue hitting him until he dies, that is murder, even though it could be pardonated if you demonstrate you were too scared to stop hitting
At the end, it's up to the judge to determine if the violence used was proportional or not
Proportionality
That's it
You can't shot someone if he tries to attack you with his fist
That's murder, not self defense
This also applies to police
Even with a knife sometimes does not equal a gun
But it depends on the actual situation
yes, it's a difficult decision
I remember some news about someone killing another in self-defense stabbing him 20 times
It was difficult to demonstrate it was just self-defense without cruelty
I'm glad I'm not a judge, tough work
We do, it's called the [Guardia Civil] and it patrols in rural, certain suburban areas, and natural areas (except in the [Basque Country] [Navarre] and [Catalonia] where the autonomous police does) as well as in all highways, ports and airports
The [National Police Corps] operates in bigger urban areas and does passport control and issues IDs
General policing is also under the control of autonomous police in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre
Interesting
Spain's police system is the same as yours, no wonder we are neighbors
State Police (Policia Nacional) and Military Police (Guardia Civil)
Also, there is a third Corps named Policia Local
Think of it like a Sheriff or City Police
Guardia Civil is pretty much military police and some even sleeping barracks, but for the most part they work like normal police
They are assigned to rural areas and forestkeeping
Yes, as others mentioned, the Guardia Civil is a gendarmerie, a military police that mostly does civil policing
Then the Army have their own military police, BUT the Guardia Civil can also act as military police in missions abroad
We had to call the GNR when we were in Vila Real de Santo Antonio last summer
They were hot as f*ck
The word "ojalá" in Spanish that means "hopefully". Comes from "Oj Ala" or something similar in Arabic that means If Ala wants
The word "tiquismiquis", one of my favorite Spanish words that means picky or fastidious (especially for picky eaters) and that comes from the Latin "Tibi mihis" that means something like "yours mine" (like you have it your way, I have it mine".
The word "rebeca", to name a specific kind of cardigan (sweater) in Spain
The name came after the Alfred Hitchcock's movie "Rebecca" where its main character (Rebecca [Joan Fontaine]) wears one
The movie made it very popular in the 40s, so the people name it after her
"Estar alikindoi" in Málaga, Spain, means to be aware of something in order to be prepared to repeat it
It's from the times when British sailors employed people in the Spanish coast and they were always sayng "take a look and and do it".
futbol
at first when it cames the people use the english football
the RAE(the institution that regulates the language) propose to say balon pie (literall ball and foot)
the people said no and still using football
&#x200B;
so the RAE said "well you bastadrs, but at least we are gonna make it seem spanish"
and we write it as it sounds in spanish futbol
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
also a lot of words have strange origins from latin and conversions but are more complicated and technical than futbol
For Spanish I would add perro lazarillo for dogs that assist the blind, taken from the main character of [Lazarillo de Tormes]
are you sayin that when i wear a rebequita i wear somthing related with hitchcocks
Yes, don't know Arabic
The XIX century in Spain is total chaos
Tens of government changes, 6 different constitutions, tens of military coups
So we just simplify it a lot and choose the most important characteristics of each period
We have a very extensive content in history subjects now tht I think about it
It's very summarised and condensed to the most important bits and taught throughout different years
It includes:
-Different ages and characteristics of pre-history
-Basic things of the first civilisations (Egypt and Mesopotamia)
-General history of Ancient Greece
-Pre-Roman Iberian peoples
-General history of the Roman Empire
-Very summarised history of the Byzantine Empire during the Early Middle Ages
-Very summarised history of the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo
-Apparition and extension of Islam
-Muslim conquest of Iberia and history of Al-Andalus until the 11th century
-Apparition and evolution of the Northern Christian kingdoms until the 11th century
-Most active phase of the Reconquista both from the Christian and the Muslim side including main dates of conquests and which kingdom did what
This ends around 1250
-Late Middle Ages of the five Iberian kingdoms that had consolidated since 1250
This includes the Black Death, Aragonese conquests in the Mediterranean, the involvement of Castile and Portugal in the Hundred Years War, the bid for power between the nobility and the monarchy, peasants revolts, apparition of bourgeoisie as a powerful class, etc
-The Castilian and Catalan Civil Wars and the reign of the Catholic Kings
It includes the discovery expeditions of the Americas, with an introduction about the Portuguese discoveries
Up until then, only the most important kings are taught because there are too many with the different Christian and Muslim states
For example: Abderramán I of Cordoba, Abderramán III of Cordoba, Alfonso I of Portugal, Alfonso VI of León, Urraca I of León, Fernando III of Castile, Alfonso X the Wise of Castile, etc
Since Isabel and Fernando, all the reigns of every monarch are taught
-16th century: Reigns of the "Austrias mayores": Charles I (V) and Phillip II
It includes the conquest of the colonial empire in the Americas, the Reformation and the Dutch Revolts
-17th century: Reigns of the "Austrias menores": Phillip III, Phillip IV and Charles II
It includes the Thirty Years War and the different fights with France and England
-18th century: War of the Spanish Succession and reigns of the first Bourbons: Phillip V, Louis I, Ferdinand VI, Charles III and Charles IV
It includes the most important consequences of the Spanish involvement in the different European wars of succession
Now it's when it becomes tricky with contemporary history
-Revolutions: English Revolution (or Civil War) as a precedent, American Revolution, French Revolution
-Napoleonic empire, invasion of Spain, Iberian War and the constitution of 1813
-Summary of 19th century Europe: absolutist restoration, industrialization, liberal revolutions, unification of Germany and Italy, mention of the Crimean War and scramble for Africa
-Reign of Ferdinand VII with the absolutist restoration, the liberal triennium and the "dreadful decade".
-First Carlist War and reign of Isabel II
Establishment of constitutional monarchy, beginning of industrialization, different changes of government through coup d'état and their reforms and constitutions
-Glorious Revolution and the Democratic Six Years
Revolution and provisional government, reign of Amadeo I of Saboya, I Republic and fall of the regime (Cuban war, federalist and Carlist revolts)
-Second Bourbon Restoration: reign of Alfonso XII and regency of Maria Cristina, institutionally rigged democracy, industrialization and economic progress, colonialism in Morocco, independence wars of Cuba and Philippines (Disaster of the '98)
-Crisis of the Restoration regime: reign of Alfonso XIII, different crises and political conflicts (like the Tragic Week of Barcelona or the Disaster of Annual), failure of the system of rigging elections, coup d'état and pseudo-fascist dictatorship of Primo de Rivera
-WW1 and postwar period in Europe
Impact on neutral Spain
-End of the dictatorship and II Republic with all its turbulences
-Spanish Civil War and terror in both sides
-WW2 with a focus on the European theater
The Pacific theater is taught in like 3 pages with the atomic bomb and the rest is ignored
-Francoism: early (outright fascism, isolationism after the defeat of the Acis, autarchy, repression) and late (US alliance, technocratic government, opening to the world, authoritarian capitalism) periods
-Cold War
-Transition to democracy and '78 Constitution
-Creation of the EU and recent history until the 2000
Many of those lessons include sections about culture, art and society, too
Because it's so much content, it's usual that some final lessons each year aren't taught at all so many students have gaps
Spain, plan might get changed soon:
We had mixed world and spanish history classes where we studied architecture and art along history
One of the 3 trimesters was for geography (world or Spanish one)
TLDR is we had World and spanish history slowly and without repetition, giving a lot of value to art and such
Then you get a repeated and condensed class of Spanish history, no dates mentioned, the general ideas and concepts are mroe relevant
1st year: from early hominids, through prehistory, up to western roman empire fall
2nd year: through middle ages up to fall of Eastern roman empire
3rd year: was only geography iirc, but we apparently we had history and art up to the end of 17th century (I though we saw it on 2nd)
4rd year: we saw world history since 18th century
Didn't make it to WW2 tbh, we just said nazis and Stalin were bad and the class was a chaos
5th year (1st of bachillerato): nothing
6th year (2nd bachillerato): all spanish history condensed from prehistory to 1975 democracy
Only thing you get marks to enter to university
WW2 wasn't even mentioned, got like 1 line
No geography
Assyrians: look what a normie
America is a continent, United States of America is a country
Which is weird as hell
We don't use "the Asias" to refer to eurasia+Indoasian continental plate
They are a single continent now
And using America as a synonym of USA has been an error
Alienates the rest of the continent (or continents if we play geologist)
How would you call those people that live in America/"the Americas"?
African, European
American
Yeah, but how would you call the people living in that single landmass (ignoring Caribbean islands)
No, in most countries constitutions are over monatchs in hiersrchy
No because constitutions state very clearly the sovereignty of the country as an independent one
Castile and Aragon united with the Nueva Planta Decrees in the 1710s, not with the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand
Similarly to how the UK united with the Union Act, not when James VI of Scotland inherited England
At the age of 18 if you didn't have to retake any year of highschool
when you are 18 you anters university and it can long 3-5 years for normal career or up to 12 for medicine
This is the answer also in Spain
17/18 in Spain too
This gets little to no coverage even in Spain, so I dont really know what they´re up to
It should have more autonomy but if their point is having a different culture than the rest of Spain, the Basque have a better chance of getting independence
Honestly I don't think they will succeed in getting independence
They already got the attention of europe and the world and no real change happened
Don't get me wrong, many things happened in Catalonia (leaders in prison, protest in the streets…) but they need the support from other countries, politically and socially, and they didn't get it completely
Now with Covid-19 everyone has other issues to cover, even if the protest and pressure comes back it won't be a new thing and the momentum is long gone
well, the short version is that there's hasn't been much happening but politics showing their real faces and everything being confirmed
Long version:
This lasts months the political parties "pro-independence" (JxCAT and ER mainly) had showed in bright light that they care more about names and who does what that anything else (like, you know, the supposed independence) and the "lliristes" (the independentists that thought that everything was going to be smooth and rainbows because "we are in the right and Europe would not allow what is happening", "don't gove them the image they want
", "som gent de pau" mainly the ones that followed JxCAT, Puigdemont and associations like Assemblea) had started to realise it (the rest had known that since the beginning or since 2017
2018
) and everything is basically in Stand By
Among the independentist movement per se (as in: the people) the majority still supports the independence but know that at this moment we don't have the conditions to get it (as much as they/we want it there's nobody in the political power to be a leader and create what it has to be created to be an independent state and neither is someone there economically), this last part had reopened problems and divisions on it's own as the independentist movement is not an ideology in itself as it's just some common objective
All in all I think everything is going toward the left as new people (and a lot of them young) had started to take over, there's really a big difference between the older independentists (right and center) and the younger ones (leftists)
The olders are the ones that fit more in the stereotype (followers of Pujol in his time [nowadays no-one likes him], CiU voters, lliristes and all of that) while the youngers were the ones who participated in/take over Tsunami's action (not organizers, we all suspected since the beginning it was made from somewhere in ER) and Urquinaona's. All of that is stopped due to the inability to keep those things in the long run, principally
I could still say thing about this or that but as what is it I think it's long enough
The coronavirus happened xD
The PM was elected with catalan pro independency parties and "a negotiation" was agreed
(Negotiation being a sinonymous for just some meetings and the central government to offer a new autonomy status while denying an independency referendum
The catalan being pissed
but the pm already elected and everyone can play "is the other one fault" as negotiations fail and everyone is happy as their electorate is fine with no solution)
But not meetings yet (that were supposed to take place in March after the PM election in January) because of coronavirus
The current government has better relationship with them compared to when conservatives governed
So they don't declare independence or make illegal referendums right now
We have been busy with Covid too, but probably the independence situation will worsen again in a few months

More like they have finally realised something that every one saw a million years ago: that nationalists have never, ever, got the majority of the popular vote, that on this day and age there is no way that a region can rebel against the government of a European country, that the EU and the countries will never support a bunch of ultranationalists or any other kind of people defying the rule of the law in the heart of Europe, and that independence would mean the ruin for the region (see the three thousand companies, starting with the main banks and firms, that left catalonia during those weeks)
Hopefully one day people in catalonia will realise too that, much like trump or brexit, this too has been a fraud that only benefits the rich, used by the elite to hide the fact that catalan students have to pay on average twice as much as the other regions for university fees, that despite being the fourth richest region per capita it has one of the worst healthcare systems (by very far the most privatised, read: taxpayer's money for their friends) ...
Almost ten years ago the left protested all over the country
As a results of that, the leader of those protests is now the Spanish vice-president
Meanwhile, in catalonia, the fuck-the-poor regional government started waving the flag to hide its corruption and budget cuts, and here we are
Yeah but the Basque already have more autonomy than Catalonia, no need for them to seek independence
Just so you know what kind of people we are talking about, during the early days of the coronavirus that woman (puigdemonts minister of education, no less) made a extremely shitty joke on twitter (retweeted by puigdemont) , openly laughing at the people who were dying in Madrid, the region most affected in Spain (8500 deaths in Madrid, almost 6000 in catalonia) . I wonder if she still thinks that 6000 people dying in her region is something to laugh about
As a Spaniard, I wish the catalan nationalists were anything like the Scots, just a fraction as democratic, respectful, progressives and the luke
Instead, we have these regional presidents, vicepresidents and presidents of the regional Parliament saying, among many other things, and just in the last years, that:
-Spaniards are crazy, illiterate monsters
-catalans are genetically superior to Spaniards
-those who vote for non-nationalist parties (more than half of the voters) are not real catalans
-the leaders of the non-nationalist parties are pigs that should be exported to Madrid or Brussels
Again, this is just a fraction of what the ultranationalist leaders at the top of the regional government have said recently
I have never, ever heard anything remotely like that from the SNP, which seems to me to be a bunch of people who love Scotland more than they hate england, and not the other way around
We tried to invade Portugal, but catalonia was always part of either aragon or france so its not the same, besides, there are many people in catalonia that dont want independence, what would become of them
That right doesn't exist anywhere, though
Not in the UK, where it's the British parliament who decides if Scotland can vote
Not in Canada, where the supreme courted sentenced that Quebec could only vote with the federal government's permission
Not in the US, where the supreme Court, and more recently the Obama administration, made it very clear that the states have no right to independence
Not in Belgium, where about half the people in Flandes support secesion from a country in which all kind of referendums are illegal
Not in France, where the constitution forbids secession
Not in Germany, where the constitutional court sentenced a few years ago that the states have no right to independence
And not in your beautiful Italy either, where, like in Germany, the constitunal Court ruled a few years ago that the regions have no right to independence and that the referendum in the North was illegal
At least in Spain there is a legal possibility for the regions to secede
Sure, currently it's not exactly easy (it doesn't help that nationalists have never got 50% of the popular vote), but at least there is a legal way to do it
Because they were tricked by the bourguoise in the XIX century to believe they were better off alone
They essentially created an outside enemy so the workers wouldnt rebell against their masters
Just like every independentist movement in the 19th century in spain, but this movements (catalonian and basque independence) have endured until today, while others just disappeared
People there who want indepence have a pretty different culture
+the language isnt related at all to any european languages and its quite common in non-formal situations
Maybe illegal was  wrong word
I'm in favour of a Catalonian referendum voted only in Catalonia
But that one had no concensus in the Catalonia parliament with half of the parties against it
And in the day vote all anti independence citizens didn't vote because it was not considered a real one
So the results were heavily biased
A real one must be done some day, but the Catalan society must decide to do it and vote it (Spaniards doesn't matter)
You keep talking about Spain, as if it were your only enemy
Let me remind you that almost three years later still not a single country or international organisation of any kind have recognised anything
Let me remind you that the EU, the United nations, the US, China, Russia and every other major power, as well as the very symbolic Kosovo and Palestine, fully supported Madrid
Let me remind you that weeks before the illegal referendum the eu's main organization for democracy sent an official letter to Puigdemont, asking him to stop with his plan and obey the Spanish rule of law
Let me remind you that nationalists have lost all the six or seven cases at the European Court of human rights (with only one exception, when the court ruled against the European Parliament and Spain, and in favour of former vp junqueras
Days later, and following orders from Madrid, the European Parliament kicked him out of the Parliament
Not even a pyrrhic victory
Let me remind you that nationalists have never won the popular vote
You can blame Spain all you want, but the truth is that you are not fighting spain, but the catalan people, the EU and the entire international community, who, as this very thread shows, couldn't care less about your "oppression" . Good luck with that, my friend
Ok, I have a question
What do you do with the people that dont want independence
You force them out of their country
Specially if the percentage is like 60-40
Now that London knows that a referendum might be not as easy or favorable for England as it was several years ago, they're not letting Scotland vote
But you don't see the Scots breaking the law or disobeying judges
In Portugal regional parties are illegal
In Belgium (where about half the people in Flandes support independence) referendums of all kind are illegal, but you don't see they breaking the law
In Italy (where about half the people or far more than that support indpendende in some northern regions) referendums were declared illegal, but you don't see the far right Liga norte breaking the law
Something similar in France or Germany, whose laws make secession illegal under all circumstances
In general, since wwii, at least in the Western world, I don't think anyone has dared to disobey the courts (certainly not at such high level)
Now, let me tell you a little bit about these "Democrats" :
The draft of the catalan constitution for the new Republic said that "parties against the Republic and the constitution" (ie, pro-Spanish parties) would be illegal
Nationalists have never, ever won the popular vote, but yet they get the majority of the parliamentary seats (and thus the government) because they are the only of the 17 regions in Spain without their own electoral law, as the one they are using (the old Spanish law) hugely favours the rural, poorer, smaller, very nationalistic provinces of lleida and girona, over the unionist provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona (a vote in girona is more than twice as important as a vote in Barcelona)
Nationalist can pass their own law anytime they want to, but they don't have the majority, so between a "foreign" undemocratic law that gives them the power they don't deserve, and a truly democratic own law with which they would often lose the power, guess what these champions of democracy have been doing for decades
Several years ago, during the crisis, leftist activists hold a popular referendum on the streets asking people about the regional fuck-the-poor government's massive budget cuts
The nationalists sent the regional police to remove the ballot boxes, arguing that the referendum was illegal
When tens of thousands of people protested against the regional government's budget cuts in from of the parliament (before they were distracted by flags and nationalism to hide the corruption and the welfare system going to shit), the now regional president called it a "coup". Similarly, when thousands of (mostly leftist) people were peacefully protesting in one of the main squares in Barcelona, they were violently dissolved by the rwgional police so that barça fans and players could celebrate winning the champions league
Puigdemont and the rest of the nationalists (with the exception of a minor far left party) voted in the regional Parliament against the righ of Western Sahara and the kurds to independence, even though they are truly oppressed and being murdered by the thousands .
I could go on, but I guess that's enough
Anyway, these people couldn't care less about democracy
They are a bunch of Conservative, elitist, classist, ultranationalist, supremacist assholes who just want to enrich themselves (according to the regional government, about 60% of the wealthiest echelon support independence ; among the poorest, only 20%)
They are nothing but an even more xenophobic and totalitarian version of trump, who has never dared to disobey a judge (let alone the supreme Court) and has never called Democrats "pigs who should be exported out of the country" or accused more than half of the country (those who didn't vote for him) of "not being real Americans', like the top catalan leaders have done
They'd win
Catalans are Spaniards, they've never ever had their own territory
We either belonged to Spain or France
The situation isn't the same as in Scotland, at all
On the other hand I agree that we have a problem, created mostly by some parties to cover their spoliation over the last decades (I'm looking at you CiU no matter how many times you change your party name)
Until 10 years ago the talking about independence was residual but you start telling people that all their problems come from the lazy Spaniards and how we are superior a nv d more educated and
Rings a bell
Well, now we are and something needs to be done but don't get mistaken it's nothing like Scotland
It is sad, yes
I personally think Spain should have been a real federation after Franco, with states with more power
Like Germany
If Catalans could collect their own taxes (like Basques and Navarre can do for historical reasons) the situation would be better
PP (conservatives) fucked the situation when they blocked in the supreme tribunal the 2006 Catalonia Statute that had been voted in favour in referendum
They did it in 2010, and after that independism scalated
Wat
Bro, nationalists (jxcat, erc, cup) got 47
49% of the popular vote in 2017, and 42
62% in the national elections last November
That's not an opinion, it's just a fact
As for polls, the last CEO (made by the regional government) from last December, shows a 43
7% support for independence, and 47
9% against
The former number is even lower (about 30%, if I recall correctly, I can't find the poll on the phone right now) when the option for federalism is given
Again, that's data form the regional government itself
Secondly, only about 40% of the people voted on that shitty referendum (the nationalists, of course) so no wonder that you guys won an illegal election made by yourselves and for yourselves, lmao
And let's not forget that people from Madrid were able to vote 4 times (there are pictures of that), that people were voting on the street without any control, and that the whole thing was such a scam that even the 'international observers' paid by the regional government (which is illegal according to UN law, but who cares anyway) said that the result wasn't worth half a shit
Congratulations, you won one of the most useless, retarded elections ever
Finally, let's not forget that Spain has the same laws that every other country (actually, far more Liberal and permissive) , including a future catalan republic, whose constitution said that 'parties against the Republic or the constitution [e.g., pro-Spanish parties or organisations]' would be illegal
To be honest, our bros in Portugal have a similar law (regional parties are illegal, no matter how much they love the Republic), so you would not be alone, but please, spare us your speeches and sermons about democracy, because you don't give a fuck about it (just ask the leftist activists protesting against the regional government's budget cuts some years ago that had their ballot boxes removed by the regional police because, according to nationalists, 'the referendum was illegal')
That's the thing, Catalonia was never it's own kingdom or anything
Por esa regla de tres you most autonomous regions should also be independant, and most not even in their current form
Up until the 19th century calatuña was just another region, until the renaxença, which started as a cultural movement and was later converted to a political reason
There has to be a point where you can accept differences and yet still be the same
We could all be independant comunidades autónomas, and yet there's still differences between provinces, cities
Where would be the end of the hypothetical independence
The mentioned Statute is interesting because what happen with it shows a problem that Spain always has had, to avoid conflicts certain things/terms are intentionally vague so everyone can give it it's own interpretation and everyone is happy, reading about the Statute make some think it was a missed opportunity to have a real conversation and ditch euphemisms, now, reading that the participation to vote for it was at around 49% takes away some force of using it as an argument when it is mentioned as a cause for the current situation
Renaixença*
Man why are you answering me as if I was in favour of it
I vote for an independent Tabarnia, fuck it all
By the way, I love Spain even with all its flaws (just like Catalonia has many flaws too) we're part of it, we're a rich complex country and we should stay together
The independence would translate in riches for corrupt politicians and a lack of prosperity for the rest and getting out of the EU
There is no denying that the polls are very close, I never said otherwise
But it's not about the numbers, but the rule of the law that we have in Europe
If they want a referendum, instead of breaking their own laws and disobeying judges, they should go to the Spanish parliament (taking advantage that, unlike in most European countries, they have the right to exist and be there) and ask for a referendum
That's what the Scots did when they wanted to vote, and that's what the basque president did when he wanted to turn our region into some kind of Puerto Rico
Of course, we all know what the result will be, but that's how Europe works: EU law overrides national law, and national law overrides regional law
In any case, getting 45% of the popular vote, or even 99%, does not give you the right to break any law
Instead of doing whatever they want, they should start convincing the catalans about the wonders of independence
If they manage to convince enough people, it would a matter of time before they get what they want
IMHO, it's hard to blame the Spanish parliament for not kneeling to 4% of the national population, who are not a even a majority in their region
Sorry, i always confused the writing
Anyway, i figured you weren't pro independence, i was just adding more backround information
It's sad to see poeple being ropped politician's ideas (though that happens all the time)
Ribadeo was named after the place it was in "Ría del Eo (name of the river)/Estuary of the Eo" and that's pretty much it
~ Almuñécar/Sexi ~
Called Sexi by phoenicias and romans, the exact meaning is unknow
Called Almuñécar (al-munakkar) after the arab conquest, means fortress surrounded by mountains
Not my city, but is disappointed that the current name given to the people from the village is "sexitanos" and not "sexys". A missed opportunity
The first time Coruña appears in the historiographic registers (under the form Crunia) is in 1208, when King Alfonso IX of León decides to repopulate the village of Faro (which means lighthouse), and grants it all of the privileges and exemptions enjoyed by the cities that are under the Charter of Benavente
The name itself is a rather peculiar case as it appeared ex novo
The only prior reference is book IV of the Historia Turpini, where a number of populations conquered by Charlemagne in Gallaecia are mentioned, including a certain Crunia
Modern philologists consider that Crunia to be a mistake by the scribe, and that it should read Cauria
Málaga was originally a colony called Malaka (In punic: 𐤌𐤋𐤊𐤀, MLKʾ) , founded by phoenicians
But to be honest I have no clue what the name was supposed to mean
It was founded by the romans as *Palma* in conmemoration for the victory over the locals (As Palms were a symbol of victory)
After the fall of the roman empire the city was abandoned and when the arabs conquered the island they rebuild it and named it simply *Madina Mayurqa*, that means city of Mallorca
After the christian conquest they followed the arab pattern and called it *Mallorca/Mallorques*, *ciutat de Mallorca/Mallorques* or simply *Ciutat* (City)
In 1715 with the Bourbon forceful centralization it got its name of Palma back, maybe for classicism
Named after a Roman proconsul, Quinta Servilius Ceipio, who in 140 B.C. built a lighthouse at the mouth of the Guadalquivir to lead ships away from the Salmedina rock
The naming goes Ceipio > Turris Cæpionis (Ceipio's Tower) > Chipiona
The lighthouse was and still is very important
Throughout history many ships have sunk after hitting Salmedina and while no official expedition has been conducted, it's suspected that there's a lot of stuff down there from Roman times and onward
Many of the lost ships were carrying valuable cargo inland to Sevilla
It is called Royal City because it was founded anew by a king
Fuenlabrada
Fuente labrada
Powed fountain
I don't know if it's the correct word, it refers to a field where you have moved the dirt to plant things, so it's like you have done it to a fountain
San Lorenzo de el Escorial
San Lorenzo means st Laurent
You see there's a very important monastery of the same name which is in fact the reason this town exists at all
It was built by philip II of Spain after winning the battle of San Quintín which took place in, you guessed It, st Laurent's day
The monastery was built near the town of El escorial and so the name stuck, It literally means  Saint laurent of el Escorial
As for the "el Escorial" part nobody knows for sure
some say It comes from holm oaks, others darkness and others minning waste
It checks out, the place is dark, full of holm oaks and
well, i don't know about the third, It sounds similar though (escoria)
It was a roman legion camp, and it dropped a few letter, so it went from Legion to Leon
Madrid has a disputed etymology
The most accepted is that it comes from Latin "matrice" (water stream), later "mayra" and "magerit" in Arabic, turning into Madrid with the Castilian conquest
Another less popular theory says it comes from a Roman settlement called Mantua Carpetana, in honor of the current Italian city
While it's true that in the southwest of the city there are Roman ruins, we don't know for sure how big was the settlement, it's likely it was just a villa
Yeah it's important to note that León doesn't come from the word *león* (meaning lion) but Latin *legio* (meaning legion)
Although of course the lion is one of its symbols
To be fair the first thought I had was if it was linked to Falun Gong, I don't know which one could be worse haha
Finnish names just don't beat around the bush
In Spanish the verb is ronronear
In Spain, it depends on the university degree you want to do:
The Salamanca University is probably the most famous and prestigious since it's the oldest one, part of the three first universities of Europe
It's no longer a major school though
Attendance is quite low compared to others
It focuses on language and law/politics and is the authority on the Spanish language, same as Oxford is to English
Is La Sorbonne university good for social sciences
I'm asking because I'm an International Relations major, and I really would like to study in a french-speaking country
How does KTH usually rank
That's my uni
It's pretty recent compared to the other ones, but the quality of education is amazing
That being said, it's different from the other public universities because it lacks in certain areas
For example, the only science majors are engineering degrees
There's no philosophy or philology
I left the UPM to get here and I couldn't be happier
The system is tricky because of all the attendance/daily work, so it's like more like being in highschool
That was just what I was about to say
Definetly the best public university for social sciences
Also, it has very new and well kept facilities  (as it was founded in 1989) and it has the youngest teachers among all public universities
I live in Madrid -where the university is- and study in the UC3M, and I have to say -although this may be a relatively biased opinion- that the Carlos III University is considered to be the best public university here in the capital, especially in degrees like economics, law, international studies and other degrees along those lines
Hey I studied an engineering degree and two masters (one of them pretty techie and the other one not so much) at UC3M and I couldn't be any prouder of the uni
I still keep in contact with teachers from there and I even hangout with them once in a while
Great education, great facilities and great uni all around
Also I'm surprised the OP of the original comment didn't mention Politécnica of Madrid, of Barcelona and of Valencia
Tbh, in southern europe we habe been way too catholic for a long time so that kind of folklore is mostly dead
In northern spain some "celtic" folklore has survived and it's very similar from the basque country to galicia
Yeah, not really
There are traditional tales and stories and fables but that kind of like magical folklore is mostly non existant
As I said it survived in remote and rural areas, specially in the north
They exist, but most have been brought back so they are not "typical"
There you can see some examples
But as I've said, not really a huge thing
Nope
Some places have legends about ghosts and similar stuff, but nothing really unique to the culture, unless you count Virgin Mary showing up to random people at random places
I always forget about you guys ahahaha
So used to seen you inside the map of the ottoman empire
I was reffering to spain portugal and italy
Tiny country with very little historical influence
The relationship between spain and roman catholicism is much closer
Plus you can't base an 800 year war against islam without being a fanatic
Our patron saint is called Santiago matamoros ffs (that means Santiago the moor-killer)
What I'm trying to say is that pre-roman-celtic folklore kinda already died when hispania was conquered by the romans (it remained in some isolated places like the north) and also after that spain was one of the most integrated provinces on the (roman) empire since it was conquered early on so the change to christianity was very organic too
Then add the reconquista to that and there you have it, pre-roman folklore in very few places
It's not weird if you think about it that way, ireland was pretty untouched
*Shawshank Redemption*: "Andrés" would never have been sentenced to life in prison
Even in the 1940s. Well, I suppose he might still want to get out after doing 20 years, but there is certainly no way Brooks (Arroyos
) would have been imprisoned for c.60 years before getting paroled
*Twelve Angry Men*: We don't have public juries for most crimes and when we do they actually don't have to agree unanimously to give a verdict
So the movie would end with the guys walking out after 11 voted yes the first time
*Schindler's List:* No Holocaust here, not much Jews in the 20th century to begin with either
*Forrest Gump:* His mother wouldn't have to have sex to have him schooled because he would have been schooled by law at 6
However, he would probably drop out and take some apprentice job when he was 12
There is no way in hell that he would pass high school and college despite being a moron by playing football
I also can't imagine what could replace the Vietnam War experience
Maybe he can get deployed to Guinea with the army or the civil guard but the "crisis" there never got that violent
In fact there was only one dead in 1968 and he was a civilian
Pretty much every other popular American history event would have to be changed, but there is *Cuéntame* as proof that something in the same spirit can be done
If I were a vampire I would live in the nordics in winter and somewhere in the southern hemisphere in summer
>I used to think Los Angeles and San Francisco were pretty much neighbouring cities the way people in movies talk how they're close together, but according to google it's a 6 hour drive
\-Meh, this can't be right
*opens google maps*
\-Holy shit
It's like going from Madrid to the coast
>I wonder how other European people from larger countries experience that
A couple of thousands of turist drive every summer from Madrid to our little town to spend at least 2 weeks
It's a 6h drive and they only do it because they come with the whole household (complete families with multiple cars)
For a short trip (1-3 days) to Madrid we always take the plane but we are finally getting our High Speed Train next year (that's what we've been told)
Mind you
That doesn't make sense for America either
>a bad review on yelp
With the knowledge I have of my fellow countrymen I don't trust this kind of reviews
Why would I trust what someone thinks it's bad food or good service if I don't even know them
For someone's opinion to matter they need to be a) an expert or b) someone I know
The comic was set in a Inuit settlement instead of white, correct
You'd be surprised
And if they ask the number they'll also ask a shit ton of other data that is in the card so you'll have to steal the card to actually steal an identity
However by that point the card has likely been reported stolen already, and the police has your prints from when you made your first card at 14 or earlier, anyway
If many of them are positive I would think [this is what happened]
And if I see that they are Spaniards it's often «Best service ever
10/10
Will come back» or «2h waiting for table and 3h waiting for the food».
I don't really eat in a place that has hundreds of reviews because it's most likely a tourist trap or packed and I don't like neither
Nope
they will speak as they normally do but just avoid the strange words
In Valencia, if someone talks to you in valencian and you reply in Spanish they switch to Spanish instantly without any question or hesitation
It is very rude not to do it
In catalonia its supposed to be the same although by my experience and some others, they stick with catalan sometimes
Edit: right we're talking about dialects
Valencian and catalan can be or not be the same language depending on who you ask
Some words are different, which can be confusing but the real problem is the pronunciation
I struggle to understand catalan
And it's not something you can change
So at the end while we're supposed to understand each other, we can feel the difference and can be a bit difficult to communicate
I imagine that if someone realises they're speaking with a foreigner who's struggling to understand them, they'll try to speak clearer (clearer pronunciation, standard words instead of regional, etc
) as a natural and logical reaction
If they are asked to "speak proper Spanish" they'll slap you across the face because that is just rude
That's a lie, actors and TV hosts go to coaches to remove their accent (or otherwise they will not be hired, neutral Spanish is required to work on TV)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Very few are "allowed" to keep their accent on TV, like Paco Tous or Paz Padilla
The stabbing part made me chuckle
I can see it happening
Wtf is that language
I can only kind of guess what some words mean
Can you post the translation of that paragraph, please
Just to clarify, Catalan, Galician, Basque
are distinct languages, not dialects
I don't think you are saying they are not, and I imagine you've used inverted commas to refer to the Italian and German ones because they are arguably separate languages too (at least some)
There are diferences on working on a tv and walking in the street that a foreigner ask you where is the plaza mayor for example and when you are awnsering them been required to use a neutral accent
That's nothing that would happen in everyday life
They have to train their accent to be sure most people can understand them at a work aimed at millions of consumers (and even then many people don't watch Spanish movies just because on-stage recorded speech is not clear enough) or simply because they're playing a character that just doesn't feature their native accents
It is confusing, but no, they are different languages
I saw that post about Jewish Ladino too and was shocked that 1) I had never even heard of it, and 2) I could understand everything
Hahahaha, that is possible too, yes
What makes Catalan different than Balearic
Valencia
East Aragonese, Arani
Pirenaic Aragonese
Why are those not considered also languages
They share the same root
Maybe people need to learn to hear, because saying the accent is not understanable it's dumb and offensive
Catalan, Valencian and Balearic are all dialects of the same language
Pfff there are people in my town with an accent I can barely understand
There's nothing offensive in not understanding other people, what's offensive is to demand them to "speak properly like me". BTW, I don't speak with a "TV accent" at all
It depends on who you ask
And what if I tell you that there are studies that attributes basque to Iberian language
Where does fit the "iberian-romance" thing then
True
Also Aragonese language has plenty of variations, mentioned in another post
More or less, one or two per valley
In La França they speak also another variation mixed with Catalonian
But also there is not only one "Astur-Leones", afaik, there is one in Asturias, one in North Leon and other around Teleno
It was just a simplification
I ask linguists

Tax harmony
Try importing a used car to Spain
EU has a free market and you are allowed to buy foreign cars, but the reason it's difficult is because cars are not a normal item like food or clothing
Cars are very expensive items that have a lot of taxes associated to them and get used by criminals to launder money
Cars are also items that get registered to an owner and that require the owner to have insurance and regular checkups
It's only normal that when you import a car to Austria, you go through all the paperwork to make the car Austrian
The only way we could get rid of the extra paperwork is if the EU would use one EU-wide-system
I don't think this would happen any time soon as countries would lose their powers
I mean, I think it's a thing in more countries than it seems
I'm Spain, for example, it is a thing, but nobody does it
But I agree, it *should* be a thing everywhere
You're right, definitely [blue]
Totally
Latin and Germanic based, simple grammar, and intuitive word construction
Importing
Poorly worded by me
The used car market is small because people buy cars new and drive them until the car dies
So used cars are very expensive
Importing cars is a bureaucratic and costly nightmare
Uuuh
Empanadilla I guess
A small version of the empanada
Dough filled with almost anything savory and into the oven
Although I think the empanadilla can be fried too
But idk if those would be considered dumplings
I didn't even know what a dumpling was until I visited Poland
Quick question, what do you understand for a dumpling
because "anything with fillings wrapped in dough" describes both a beef Wellington and a strudel
I just looked It Up
they don't count
If you look on wikipedia our sections for dumplings IS increadibly short and pretty strange
I had never Heard of bolo de pote or cocido de pelotas till today
I Guess we just don't have well known dumplings
Empanadillas are listed as pies, i think along the line of english meat pies
And that feels kind of right
I don't even know how do you translate dumpling to Spanish
We don't have any traditional dumpling at all
We don't really have either (well, we have one example, boiled meatballs with breadcrumbs)
unless you consider fried stuff, then croquetas are a dumpling, and so are empanadillas and buñuelos
So does frying count
Pilota is very common in Catalonia during Christmas,  but I never imagined that it would be considered a dumpling
I mean it's meat with egg and flour
are then Croquetas dumplings too
It's not cocido de pelotas, in regular cocido (like the madrileño) you usually put big "meatballs" made from meat and breadcrumbs
Those are called "pelotas" and apparently count as dumplings
At least in Comunidad Valenciana, Cataluña and Madrid they are very common
I think they include them because they're boiled while croquetas are fried
Well, you could define It that way
but then you get some problems
A chocolate croissant IS suddenly a dumpling, but gnochi aren't, and neither are spätzle
Beef Wellington, meat pie, strudel, ensaimada, Apple pie, etc
they would all be dumplings
So you end up missing some clear ones and Including many dubious ones
Here IS my take:
I think the key aspect IS: boiling/steaming some type of dough with a roughly spherical shape, as opposed to noodles which are more elongated and thiner
You can make them with or without(again, spätzle and gnochi) filling
I searched for info in the wiki and the spanish edition of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen
However i think it's down to the culture and the definition IS a bit open
I mean the english wiki is way more open about the term
Funny, i'm from Madrid and i've never seen It, though my family IS from Castilla la Mancha, so that might be It
i'm from madrid too and have never heard of meatballs in cocido neither lol
it's definetely been too much time since i Saw them in a petty food war
>pan fried
I've Heard about this but i've never seen It
I think Gyozas are not pan fried if that's what you mean
They're steamed, that's why you add water to the pan
About the size limit
If you add it It works way better, i think because we think of dumplings as small
but it's still pretty arbitrary
Why would an empanadilla be a dumpling but a calzone miss out
And what happens with buñuelos
Or choux pastry
I don't think of them as dumplings
and then there's this:
....IS It a dumpling
Well i think that criteria is better, But there are dessert fillings
I've seen some sour cherry for Ukraine
You still ran into some problems with popovers or choux pastry and I've seen some monstruous dim sum in china
I STILL believe empanadillas (which i think in America are called empanadas) aren't dumplings
The consistency of the dough when fried IS too diferent to be a dumpling, not to Talk about making them in the oven
That's my opinion
Yeah
except empanadillas aren't boiled
The problem IS not the shape, it's the method of cooking
Pierogis are virtually equal in shape to empanadillas
But maybe i'm missing smth, i for one don't know of a single boiled empanadilla
Cooking method IS very important, the dough used to make strudel and spätzle IS almost the same ...you just add milk to the  latter one
and the end result IS quite different
I'd argue pierogi isn't an empanadilla
Yeah but the spanish wiki excludes frying from the list and in the english wiki empanadillas aren't even mentioned
>But they could be boiled, and then you'd have a dumpling like the ones you described
If they were boiled i would call them dumplings, but they're not
>Shape is the main difference between cultures, imo
Ravioli, which is the Italian reply, doesn't have a round shape, and that's just the traditional part of every place for what's the same cooking process: wrapping something
I added shape because if you consider spätzle and gnochi dumplings there's literally nothing else to save noodles from being dumplings
And you can wrap things in dough without It being a dumpling, strudel, beef Wellington
>Gnocchi, otoh, are considered dumplings in their English Wikipedia page
>Noodles can't be because they don't wrap the other food, which is the main idea imo
Gnochi don't have filling
And dumplings can get Big
>And then again, I still believe that what OP asks is what kind of completely wrapped in dough food is typical of other cultures, and not if they have exactly that kind of dumpling
I agree
The op said dumplings, but he/she really didn't mean exactly dumplings or at least he/she didn't look into what the Word means, which seems pretty debated
>Regarding the link, I don't think they call those big dumplings by the same name of the little ones anyway
I'll look into it
Do sincebollistas deserve human rights
You can also totally break apart Spain with Paella ingredients
Spanish omelette without onion of course
Also, those who prefer the Spanish omelette a bit raw or those who prefere it well done
I'll solve it for you guys: in Spain we call it "napolitana"
I'm not Italian, but I have to say that Panettones are way better, I love them
Panettone all the way
I don't think so, con cebolla ftw
Obviously not
I love raisins
And chocolate
salted chocolateraisins
Mixed with popcorn
If we can consider this a sport

Hey, the one you mentioned is an unoffical sport in south Spain

What is that country that you have a huge crush and maybe you don't even know way
In my case is the Czech Republic
I want to visit so bad, I've started learning the langueage, listening to Czech music and I can spend a lot of time wandering in StreetView through its streets, despite the fact I have no conection whatsoever to that country in particular
Ireland, for sure
Maybe it's the green landscape, blue sea and grey sky
Maybe it's the culture, its history (pre-Norman Ireland is particularly fascinating) and especially its music
It definitely isn't the beer, that's for sure
Greece
I love Greece so much and even tried to learn the language, I think it’s a beautiful country and I love their culture
I hope I get to visit one day
Norway
There's this huge spanish youtuber/streamer called Rubius who also happens to be half nowegian
I used to watch his videos as a kid, back in 2011/2012 and his vlogs when visiting his family in Norway made me fall in love with the country
The UK
The architecture, the landscapes, the music, the humor, the food (yes, the food
It also helps that I'm in love with a Brit (5 years together and counting)
Leaving soon after 10 years here but I know I'll be back sooner or later
I'm actually enjoying learning it
Čestina je těžčí než další jazyky, které jsem se naučil, ale mám cizí jazyky velmi rád. Také, je pro mě zajímavé, že čeština je úplně jiný, a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost
I hope I didn't do too bad, and I hope to keep learning about your country
I'm from Galicia and went I went to the South of England it felt more like home (at least nature wise) than most of the rest of my country, so I don't expect Brits to come here, as they mostly look for the hot and sunny weather
Funnily enough, there's a somewhat similar law in modern Spanish legislation (it's even a meme between law students)
\- Article 612 of the Civil Code: the owner of a swarm of bees shall have the right to chase it over other person's farm, compensating its possessor for any harm done
If the farm was enclosed, he will need the consent of the owner to enter it
And yeah, the Brehon laws in general are quite fascinating
Poor girl is going to get her British citizenship removed for saying such heresy
I've learned that every time you have different clauses you have to put them between commas, but maybe I understood it wrong
Could you tell me how you would say this so I can learn the more natural way to speak Czech
I would rather preffer not to need a passport
I don't care, the spanish passport is the 8th in the list of best passports in the world, it gives me access to 186 countries, and the best passport in Europe is the german which gives access to 188 countries, so not a big difference
I would definitely go for the EU one
I wouldn't mind an EU one, but I'd rather have a national passport
I am definitely pro-EU, I'm glad the EU exists and that we're a part of it, but if I have to choose I'm Spanish before European
Although I gotta say recent events are making me feel more European rather than Spanish, so my answer might change in a year from now

Good but in Spanish you need to start the exclamation with “¡”
Sorry I’m having a bad day
We don't have that song
After all, it's an English children's song, not a Spanish one, so why would we have it to begin with
Pobre joan petit :/ no sabia pas de la seva historia
Probably is because is a song that does not translate very well in Spanish, the words are so long that there is no way to fit it in the tunes
Head - Cabeza
Shoulders - Hombros
Knee - rodillas
Toes -  dedos de los pies
It's Spain is quite popular to teach during English class for kids
So essentially has became an educational song to learn some English
To be honest, I didn't know this song had a 'Spanish version'. Although that seems to be a direct translation of the English lyrics (not even and adaptation to try to keep the rhymes)
If anyone had heard it before, let me know :)
Never in my life have I heard that before, and it looks like an abomination
All of them
Many of them, but one particularly cringing is Cristina Cifuentes, former President of Madrid region
She was a high profile politician, with a promising career, soft right wing but very beligerant and outspoken
And then it was published on a newspaper that she got a Master's degree in a very fishy way, without any evidence of  her role and qualifications as a student
She declined to resign in a ver stubborn style and while waiting for a hearing/trial, the press got access to a security video of her stealing in a supermarket
She is out of politics for good
A lot and still few
Accurate
Even Adolfo Suarez
>So much suppressed history too
I'm not sure how it'll work its way out eventually
It won't. We are like that family that doesn't talk about their feelings
We suppress everything and carry on pretending like nothing happened while deep down we hate each other
Suárez exploited people's fear of going back to fascism to get elected
If not for the stealing in the supermarket, she would be still in politics
Shit doesn't hit the fan here for other politicians that did the same thing
Hvala
Piedra, papel, tijeras, so the usual rock, paper, scissors
By the way, do you have a Game called gunner
You can either shot, guard or reload
Guard protects against shot and you need a reload before a shot
It's played in turns like rock paper scissors
Here it's rock paper scissors too but there is a version including knife and trash bin
There's also another game used for the same purposes which is called "pares o nones" (even or odd)
Both players have to choose either odd or even and they show at the same time their hands with some fingers out
They count the fingers and check if the number of fingers is odd or even, the player which has chosen that result wins (or goes first at whatever they decided to)
We played it where I grew up in the US
You’d have to double tap your thighs and then either shoot, guard or reload and so on until someone got shot lol
Not really, but you can divide the Game in sections
And everybody calls them turns
It's not a version, but rather a different Game altogether
Yeah you're right
It only works if n(n-1)/2n is a whole number
so n must be odd
De-industralization due to the European Union
Our economic model is based on tourism and services
We became a party and vacation place for norther europeans at the same time we were losing almost all of our industry
One of the background reasons is in good weather areas people have less tendency to leave the area if the economy is not going good
Think for one second of this, you are offered the same job (same conditions) in a rainy town in northern europe and in a sunny one by the mediterranean (you are not from any of them)
Most people will choose the second one
This different behaviour impacts directly in the unemployment rate
In Spain a lot of young people are qualified for professional jobs in STEM but the economy is centered around the service and tourism industries so not that many Engineering or Science jobs aside from Mechanical or Civil Engineering jobs and basic IT telecommunications and customer service jobs
Want to be a Software Developer, a Chemical Engineer, or a high finance professional
You're gonna have to leave to another country
Some foreign companies don't value the Spanish workforce enough to create non-customer service/sales jobs in Spain for several reasons (e.g. very bad level of English in older Spaniards, no proficiency with technology, etc)
It's not an innovative economy, a lot of people work government jobs rated per hour where they're often just staring at screens trying to pass the time
Doesn't help that our social security is spiraling out of control bc of the generational gap
Politicians who focus more on power than changing things, I'm frustrated to see my country let experts and geniuses go and then open shitty hotels on the coast so that the drunks of the north come to do what they can't do in their country
It's just the fucking politicians
More tarrdellas and less puigdemont, more Pastor and less casado, more rubalcaba and less Sanchez
And now it's harder than ever, separatists no matter how much they say they only think about independence (it's legitimate) but this greatly reduces the actions of government, and the "Spanish centre right" is the equivalent of the European far right, and the government we have it's progressive so I don't expect many pacts
My opinion is that politicians have 70% blame for the current situation
Btw: EU made us dismantle part of our industry to enter the EU
The lack of industrialization throughout the countries combined with an ideology that predates what "successful" countries are doing now
Before the industrial era large plots of land for agriculture and nice weather were the way to wealth, now not so much
Now beautiful beaches together with nice weather are the way to a somewhat okay life standard for most people
all in all southern Europe is just kinda stuck between what used to be an amazing past and an uncertain future
&#x200B;
EDIT: corruption doesnt help either
1- Because stronger nations that are also part of the EU eat all the cake
Most policies and politics are designed to fulfill the necessities of Germany, France, Belgium
Most are not positive for southern European countries, but who cares right
2- Illegal immigration
I think it's obvious that Mediterranean countries received the majority of the wave of people coming to Europe illegally
We have to feed them, dress them, give them a place to sleep and live
Even if immigrants get distribute between some EU countries (not all, because we all now that Poland and Hungary never receive immigrants but the poor countries got to do it because if not we get a sanction)
This means that every year there are thousands of people coming here
More people = less jobs = more competitiveness = the few jobs that exist are shit because companies know they can do whatever they want and people will still need those jobs
3- Southern Europe has become a tourism paradise
That's cool, it means a lot of the GDP comes from services (hotels, restaurants, disco
) But now other industries are low developed there's almost no jobs available
Doctors, engineers move to other countries (UK, Germany, France) just to have an opportunity to work in what they studied for
4- Companies are pretty smart and they know how to get the best of the law without breaking it
For example here in Spain a company can make you a temporary contract for 6 months, then they can renovate it for another 6 months, and after that they have to make you a permanent contract (by law)
So they hire you for a year and then they fire you no matter how good you are so then don't have to make you a permanent employee and pay the medical insurance, holidays, days off, bonuses
then after a month or two they hire you again if you are lucky (so them don't have to make a permanent contract)
Aside from this, all about political situation is not helping at all
I won't go into details but politics are shit
> 4- Companies are pretty smart and they know how to get the best of the law without breaking it

The "picaresca" is common rule
Unemployment figures are high, but nowhere close to the official ones
It's just companies (and, to some extent, workers) trying to evade taxes
Spain is in the South and the description of @RedKrypton is amazingly impressive
Partially, they just said that operators and engineers had to earn the same as in Germany so the Spanish industry would not beat the German one by prices
In that moment in Spain even the president of goverment was earning less or average as a German engineer
We didn't have money to pay the standard, so they ditch the industry and with it 30% of the economy those days
The goverment then invested in agriculture a tourism and saved the face, but some places as Extremadura are really fucked because they have no tourism and no industry
Now the services sector (banking) is growing in main capitals like Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, so they atract investment and the remaining and new industries are set up around them, this build a syphon effect that attracts young educated people to this capitals making the rest of Spain literally empty of these professionals, so other industries are struggling and they don't have people, some professions even dissapearing
The money goes centralised to capitals so the country side is very poor while most people live there
This makes the perfect battle field for populism and the rise of the far-right
I could keep going but I think you can see the situation
Is the EU to be blamed
Absolutely not
The Spanish politicians are as they didn't reindustrialised the economy once Spain were able to do it and so far they didn't rise salaries neither, so we are in the situation they wanted but now they are worried about the far-right because that was not in the plan
Often there is a **huge** language barrier
A Portuguese moving to Germany means he will have to start learning German from scratch at >20 yrs old
You might be able to get by a bit with English, but often people from the southern countries don't speak English that well either
From what I have noticed with friends is that they will move when there is really no more place to go
Or when they have been stuck unemployed at their parent's home for many many years
Maybe it's to build more buildings for more tourism
Such beautiful islands are going to end up being the hotel of Europe :(
Don't worry mate, the topic is hot
Imagine having a degree and a master in engineering and be working at McDonals for years
Then you said that :)

I moved to London, but many are to attached to their families or actually have already children and it's too difficult to jump to other EU state
Thanks for the info (I didn't know it) ;)
I've just googled it and our National Statistics Institute says that the average monthly spending in food and non-alcoholic drinks was 142 €. Looks a bit low to me, I estimate I spend about 160 (not including eating out or ordering delivery food which accounts for 1-2 meals a week), but I guess that depends on the person
Accodring to Google, 70% of Spaniards spend between 150€ and 420€. The average seems to be 210€ (2525€/year)
From the OCU in 2015 the average cost of the grocery shopping (includes things that aren't food) is 415,5€ per month and you can spend up to 3
600€ more per year depending on where you live and shop
About 120€
That seems to be a lot compared to your average income
It's about the same in Spain
Nothing outright dumb but just understandable assumptions, like thinking all of Spain is a semi-arid plain while most of the north is extremelly forested
Well
This was beyond saying anything

Trump's speech is recognizable enough that I start reading stuff with his voice even if I've not been told it was something he said

Nope, and I'd support a further decentralization of the EU and reduction of EU powers over member states
This
My father has lived in Spain for 30 years and isn't allowed to vote whereas my aunt who hasn't lived here for nearly 50 years or my cousin who wasn't even born here can vote in the generals
Edit: For the people commenting that my father should get Spanish citizenship
He could do it easily enough but he would need to renounce his German citizenship it isn't worth it for the shitshow called the Spanish general election
I just think that you either say everybody can vote, people that are in some way blood related to someone that lived here decades or centuries ago and people that live here (for long periods) regardless of their citezenship, or you deny both groups their right to vote
then tell your father to get the cittizenship
he can
if he hasn't yet he's obviously not interested in participating on spanish politics

> Costruire castelli in aria (to build castels on air)
This exists in Spanish also ("Construir castillos en el aire")
I've even heard it in Catalan ("Construir castells en l'aire")
Both might come from the Italian one
According to this [source] (sorry, only in Spanish), it comes from the French and it exists in multiple languages, not just the Romance ones
I could get by in almost all Romance language countries but Romania and Italy would be a challenge
I don't know how far my German is going to get me in the Netherlands
Switzerland wouldn't be that hard but my French isn't the best and the German speaking Swiss can make if very hard to understand them
I guess I'd be able to communicate with italian and portuguese people, but other than that I'd need to switch to English
I could go to Italy and Portugal without speaking English and I am sure we would understand each other perfectly
With a Latin based language you can have a conversation in Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy (possibly Romania too)
Do you think France is easier than Italy
I got by in Italy just fine
I haven't been to France but I assume it would be harder
Yes
Everybody here says I'm going to do my Erasmus in Itlay because it's just like Spanish and then nobody passes the language test
I don't know, French and Romanian are way harder to understand than Portuguese and Italian for a spaniard
But maybe with short words and using the hands we could get to understand each other
You just start driving until you find out you're in another country

I like to have picters I took myself that remind me of cool places/moments, or sometimes customizer my phone with a theme from a videogame/show
So right now I have an ATLA lock screen and my home screen is a picture of a snowy lake in Sweden, from my Erasmus exchange
On my desktop screens I have pictures from a very cool sunset, one of them has a picture of some grapes growing in a vine covered in sunlight, and the other a misty hilltop bathed in shadows
[This for my phone, centered]
Phone: My dog locked and me and my fiancee when unlocked
PC: My dog
On my desktop and laptop: Windows 10 default background pre 1903 update, the one with more deep blue, I hate the new light blue one
Beer, chocolate, waffle, french fries, tintin, bad roads, no government most of the time, hazaard and Courtois, Brussels and the EU, Congo genocide
Ben L.G. Weyts, the N-VA flemish minister for animal welfare and a bunch of other things
How divided they actually are, politically speaking
I've heard in the last elections they had, half of the country voted far-right and the other half far-left
French fries
Nothing to be honest
Redhead big boob's with a moustache
I'm not sure why I have this picture
Oh come on
Portugal and France mostly
As a Spanish, Spain
The most joked country in Spain is Catalonia
We kinda have a love/hate relationship with France
Mostly hate
So yeah, they get shat on
Probably Spain itself (we see ourselves as a bad country) and the countries giving us tourists (Germany, France and Britain)
Or ourselves
I think is more about ourselves haha
Also British *balconers*
Agree
And before Murcia was popular, it was Andalusians and Lepe xDD
Teruel existe también
It was a prank, bro
Right now it says 17,7º, which is indeed chilly
Anything under 19º feels cold because we have a high humidity, and in this apartment we only get like and hour and a half of direct sun every day
I should turn on the heating but we have an old A/C that makes a lot of noise and consumes a lot of power, and it's not like I'm freezing anyway (that's what a good, thick cotton robe is for)
18,5°C in my living room
Something between 18°C and 20°C it's OK for me
20º
>what do you consider to be a cold room
Depends on what I am doing, what I am wearing
If I am sitting in front of my computer's screen, for many hours, less than 20º feels cold
24C. 19C and below I'd consider a little cold, 20C is ok
20,8C
I feel some disconfort so I just adjusted the thermostat to 23C (like 30 minutes before reading this
21,2 ºC according to the thermometer
Decent room temperature, I'd say anything under 20 is cold, 21-23 is ideal, 24 and more is hot
I aim for 21 ºC in my room in winter (not easy because we have some shitty storage heaters)
The rest of the house is probably at 18 at best, but I don't mind it much as I live alone and spend most of the day in my room anyway
Thermostats aren't very precise in general, and their location within the room also affects a lot to the measure
20-21 is ideal for me when I'm moving, but if I'm just watching tv I only feel confortable from 23
When I'm working in the desk I'm ok if it's 22-23
Wait, it is part of Schengen
Do you mean any european can go there to live and work without a visa
Yes but not because of Schengen, which is only about borderless travel
Me, a wanna-be Scandinavian, using these words
Same structure as in spanish, «vergüenza ajena».
I am curious, is there any reason for the use of those two nationalities
Seems a fun story
Can’t understand a thing but I can recognise a sort of Navy SEAL copypasta when I see one
Am I right
Lo sé, el comentario era más por hacer la gracia que por otra cosa
In the Canaries, very
You can go for a stroll or walk the dog at 2am easily
Before covid
Now there's a curfew from 11pm
In addition, I have many Latin American friends that when I asked what is what they like the most from Spain, the reply is how safe it is
In Murcia (460k) there are some very bad areas that you should certainly avoid
Mainly because of drug dealing, social marginality, and ethnic conflictivity, those places are indeed dangerous
Outside of those neighbourhoods the city is mostly safe
There's still a chance to get mugged but nothing special I guess
I have lived in Madrid for 6 years (in the central area, inside the M-30), and exceptuating a friend that's been pick pocketed, no incidents at all
I usually came home drunk as one can get at 4 am in the morning and nothing never happened to me
The neighbourhood in the outskirts probably are a different story, but I think most of the fame they have of being dangerous come from the 80s when they were actually dangerous
In my hometown (75k), also nothing happened, just being "mugged" by some gypsy children when I was like 13, but nothing serious
Now living in Coruña (230k), there is a curfew so I didn't really walked late at night but never felt unsafe at the city
Plus, the city is so dense that I think I've never been alone at street so far
When I did my Erasmus in Germany tho, I didn't feel unsafe and nothing happened to me, but the lack of light of some places was really disturbing to me, so it felt a little scary
I'm talking as a woman
I've never felt unsafe here in Spain (except in Barcelona, I'd never comeback there because of that anyway)
Where I live I've walked outside happily in the middle of the night with a bunch of girl friends, and none felt unsafe
And it's not even like I live in a rural place far away from everyone, I'm from the Canary Islands lol
Pretty walkable
One of the things that I've noticed is that abroad the streetlamps lighten just a small spot around them
Which leaves spots of darkness where you can't see what's in it
In Spain there are no dark spots
The light extends to all the street
So it's much better and safer to walk around
Since nightlife here is pretty normal, it can be very safe to walk at night
You can be unlucky of course, but it's not a risk to do it
Edit: The police patrols at night and they tend to move around the city so you feel extra safe
Are there any areas at all in Iceland where you could feel unsafe
I think most people would be scared in Barcelona
I'm a man who lives in Santa Coloma, next to BCN, and I prefer to not walk alone at home, at any moment that's dark
I do it anyway because my girl friends are even more afraid than me
Based on what some friends told me I wouldn't even walk alone at day
I don't know, I usually feel really safe in Barcelona, you just have to avoid specific neighborhoods, but even then
The only problem in BCN is if you're drunk and fall sleep, then you'll be 100% robbed
> In addition, I have many Latin American friends that when I asked what is what they like the most from Spain is how safe it is
I live in Barcelona, where according to some [comments here] is even considered dangerous
I know a lot of Latin American people and they all appreciate how safe the Barcelona metropolitan area feels to them
Oh, well I'll keep that in mind
When I went to London I felt pretty safe, but I guess as a tourist I see things differently
Shit
That was scary, it gave me goosebumps
Recently, I met a Spanish guy who lived in Northern Ireland 25 years ago (I did too for a year)
He was only 18yo and didn't speak much English
He had a written address on a piece of paper where he was meant to go
A proper punk guy (mohawk and all), which back in the day they were unfairly labeled as dangerous, approached him as he looked lost
Grabbed the piece of paper and told him to follow him
He walked him all the way to the address and say goodbye
that was all
It's a Barcelona problem, not a nation-wide one
Where I live it's pretty safe, but I've seen someone getting robbed in Barcelona
I'll never comeback, unless that problem's solved
I've felt far more unsafe in places like Alicante, València or Murcia, than in Barcelona
It has some bad areas, as every big city does
Good thing in Cartagena is that the bad zone, Lo campano, is on the outskirts and badly connected so you can't really get there by accident
In Murcia there are a couple dangerous zones in the middle of the town
I'd like to be mugged by a glacier then
Regarding the Icelandic standards of gettho looks xD I did experience a similar thing in the Netherlands, in Eindhoven
The area where I lived was kinda nice to me but then found out by the locals that it was considered a bit of middle/working class area
From your experience, which nationalities are most present among inmigrants in that area
That's a ghetto
Daaaamn
Robbed is too general of a phrase in English, was it a pickpocketing or mugging
I'm from Murcia capital and I've been several times in Alicante and I can say I've been at late hours of the night and didn't feel unsafe at all
Can't say a thing of Valencia though
Alicante or Murcia
Valencia I cam believe, but I always felt that Barcelona is the worst when it comes to that
Arguably some neighborhoods in Madrid too, but most is fine
Someone felt asleep waiting at the metro station and a group of people started taking their things
Idk if I'd define that as pickpocketing, but no one was threatened
Ah okay
Tbf getting robbed after falling asleep at the metro station would happen in the safest of cities
Oh yeah, I mean I've been personally lucky, but I know people who had gotten their phone pickpocketed, and I've seen news about
I'm just saying I feel uncomfortable and that I don't like it, not that Barcelona is the most dangerous place on earth
Not really
As everything in spain (and europe), it is a regional thing
If you want to go by stereotypes then yeah you could say the spanish guitar but other typical instruments are the bagpipes, the txistu (a 3 hole flute that sounds like the devil), the castannettes, nunut, etc,etc
In Galicia, it's definitely the Galician bagpipe
The pandeiro (a type of tambourine) is also quite typical
For the rest of Spain, the lute and the bandurria, on top of the obvious Spanish guitar
well the spanish guitar or the clasic guitar is quite closelly asociated with spain
Imho the [bandurria] could be the one, or at least more widespread than most
What do you mean "not really"? The standard/classical guitar is literally called [Spanish guitar]
As someone from Navarre, your Txistu description is spot on
That said, I would say Spanish guitar is a good example
Albéniz, Tárrega, Rodrigo
in galicia you will see that their instrument is the Galician bagpipe
Yep, the tunos are also fun when they play that hahaha
Yeah but that guitar doesn't apear in many other traditional music styles
Like you won't see a guitar in any gallician, basque, asturian, cantabrian or for that matter castillian music
I'd say the guitar could be the national instrent because we are known for it and peoole play the guitar
But it can also be discussed
I barely tolerate txistu just because i'm from bilbao hahaha
But yeah it is terrible
How can you not like the txistu
It makes me feel nostalgic whenever I hear txistu eta danbolina played by the same person
Those unforgettable Christmas moments
More than 1000 people were killed by the [1755 Lisbon earthquake] being a town of less than 2000 inhabitants at the time
Also, some of the crew of Columbus' first voyage to America were locals, and one of them allegedly was the first European ever to smoke tobacco, for which he was jailed
The battle of Vitoria in 1813, a major battle in the napoleonic wars were France got kicked out of the Iberian peninsula
The fact that in 1873 it declared independence and got it for a brief moment, we were able to even produce our own coin the "Duro cantonal"
IIRC my region also got independence around that time and even tried to ally the United States
I wouldn't now where to start, so much shit has happened in Madrid at this point that I don't think there's a most notable event
We have the [Centro Virtual Cervantes] or CVC, but I'm not sure if they're the ones managing the property rights of Cervantes's work, considering that his works are so old that they don't have copyright anymore
Author's rights expire in 70 or 80 years here, if I remember it correctly
Didnt he sell the licence for the game adaptation, not the IP itself
And from what i heard the problem was that he didnt think the games were going to be very successful so he asked for an upfront price instead of a % of earnings and then TW3 became wildly popular
"Pie" means foot in Spanish
And I have a H&M cap that says "PURE" on it because is the spanish version of the word purée and it always makes me smile
"Dick" (English) = "Dic" (Catalan) and it means "(to) say/tell" (1st person present tense)
One of my favourites has to be "constipado", which simply means that you have a cold (so nothing to do with bowel movements or lack thereof)
In Spain we use the word "Constipado" when someone has a cold, but some people think it translates to Constipation
Rape is a kind of fish in spanish
First that comes to mind is "actual" which means "current" as in right now, a pretty confusing "false friend" for many people in school (including me)
"Actually", is wrongfully used as "currently" many, many times
And "Rape" means angler fish
Interesting
what is the infinitive
In Spanish it’s _saltar_
Just be a decent person and try to blend in, by that I mean do as you see locals do
Also, many countries in Europe, specially in less touristic areas, are monolingual, so they speak their native language and that's it
Trying to learn some basics helps a lot, for example, some weeks ago I was in Germany with my parents, who only speak Spanish, and when I tried to speak some very basic German they were impressed and more eager to help
You may not be the best speaker, but people will appreciate the effort
On top of what they've said which is pretty much simple common sense, honestly, I'd say try not to look like the typical tourist, and I'm talking specifically about the clothing (but also about being oblivious and unaware of your surroundings)
We have have a word for these in Spanish: *guiri*; look it up
Talking specifically about warmer countries or warm season
Ditch cargo pants, knee-long pants in freaking November, socks & sandals combo, safari hats, sports caps, university/sports t-shirts or hoodies, sports shoes instead of regular shoes, trekking shoes, travelling backpack (or anything resembling the backpacker look), Hawaiian shirts, swimsuit or shirtless in the town center, high socks
Just wear jeans and t-shirt/shirt like everyone else does and try to blend in
To point the obvious, if you look like this you're just begging to get pickpicketed (places with high tourist density)
Also, don't get shitfaced drunk and jump off balconies
What do you mean
If you're actually interested in the local culture and languages you'll be very welcome wherever you go
use deodorant and shower regularly
you can be the most respectful guy out there but if you smell like a trash can then you're annoying people next to you at trains, restaurants, hostels, etc
you kiss me too much
I am spanish, she is ukrainian
I think everybody can figure out who said that
My colombian gf likes hot chocolate with cheese, which i find to be *a true aberration of nature
Besides that, spanish is weird, so we might dont be able to understand each other even if we are speaking the same language lol
They sell sweet popcorn in the cinemas here and it’s delicious
*yes*
*I feel you*
Chocolate a la taza y queso fresco
Same in Catalonia (although not in other Catalan-speaking regions like Valencia AFAIK): "dos quarts de tres" (two quarters of three)
Queso sin madurar
Con chocolate  encima sería parecido a queso con miel que es de lo mejor
That we are socialist and there's no freedom of speech At least we don't lock children in cells  u know
That we have wars all the time
*Oh wait
Not really a stereotype but
Many americans online seem to think that we don't exist or just assume we're American too
To be fair, there definitely are more Americans than Europeans online and I too simply assume I'm talking to someone from the US
That Europe is all the same and you can make stereotypes about the whole region somehow
There was a 5 bed house with large basement (with wine cellar) and swimming pool for sale in our area for €425K recently
Probably could’ve got it for €380-390K
In Almería, Spain you can get [this] a pretty nice apartment
Something like this with pool and garden
8100 sqft land
South Spain, like 15 min from the beach
I thought the op is American so he can compare with something s/he is familiar with
Avoid restaurants with menus in multiple languages, or with photos of a paella and sangria
Not authentic, and they rip you off
These are normally closer to monuments or landmarks, or along promenades in seaside towns
And if the menu is translated to English, the worse  the translation and design, the better the quality
And if the menu is translated to English, the worse  the translation and design, the better the quality
I dont know, in Spain is relatively common in any city where the menu is in spanish, regional language (basque/catalan/whatever) and english
Regarding the "empty steak" there is a certain cut from the sirloin called "vacío" (empty) in spanish
Maybe in portuguese it's the same
Same in Spanish, "diente de león".
Normalmente escribo en español y luego el traductor automático me lo traduce todo
EDIT: oh, it didn't work this time, I usually write in Spanish and the translator do the rest automatically
No, we just use English in the multicultural subs and other languages in the language-specific subs
I write in French on the r/France but English everywhere else
I write them in English directly
It's the main reason why I use Reddit, because it helps me improve my skills on informal English
That and the subs about cute pet videos haha
I just learnt English
I like to speak in english so for practice i have never chosen to translate
Except onders instead of subs, this sounds like how my siblings talk, as they spoke way less Dutch as children than me so they use English grammar with Dutch words
In your country, what's considered the first floor of a building
The one at street level or the next one
In Spain, the floor at street level is floor 0 (or *bajo*, literally "low" or "short"), and the next one is the first floor
What about your country
Barcelona has a lot of buildings where you have ground floor, then above it you have the principal or main floor and then the first floor
And in some cases it can be even more confusing with a "entresuelo" before the principal, so the second floor is actually the fourth
So delivery agencies usually ask for big packages "is the address a real n-th floor
". People looking for renting usually ask the same question, specially if the building has no elevator
Interesting
We also have the word *parterre* (from French, too) in Spanish, but it means garden or something like that
I have never been in a building like that, but honestly it doesn't surprise me
We're such a mess at everything
Principal is 1st floor
Entresuelo is mezzanine
Maybe those first floors where open to each other
One of the most revolutionary inventions of the 20^th century
The mop
The mop, the lolipop, the submarine and the astronaut suit
Marine corps
We are basically the best at inventing things by puting a stick to something that already exists
Don't know if it counts, but in Spain a lot of rivers/places start with Guada, which comes from Arabic and means "living water" or "current"
Some examples include:
Guadalajara
Guadalquivir
Guadarrama
Guadiana
Guadalete
Guadalaviar
Guadalupe
Etc
There are many places with names tht have a bland entomological origin but nowadays they don't sound that wya because those words aren't used anymore
For example, "extremadura" used to be a land in the "extreme" of a kingdom, so kinda like "borderland", but nowadays "Extremadura" is an specific region
Similarly, there are many towns called "Medina", which is city or town in Arab
Nobody uses "medina" or "extremadura" in their original general meaning anymore
There are also many towns and villages that have very straightforward names
Many are called things like Villa(something) of (river/region)
"Plaza de España"; technically all of them are
No, Guada comes from "wad", meaning current
"Wād al-ḥaŷara" (Guadalajara) means stone river, for example
Edit: So after briefly double checking, I think that wadi/wad actually means both river and valley (?) I'm not sure though
I see, that's probably it
I think using "wad" as the main word for river instead of "nahur" was a feature on Andalusi Arabic dialect
The Arabic dialect in Al-Andalus was close to Maghrebi Arabic but it developed his own features too
Most of the names I gave refer to rivers, it is also something I've always been told
When searching the origin for the prefix "Guada", most Spanish sites tend to agree that it comes from river/current/water in Arabic
A directive, every country will adapt it differently and internet will just ignore countries law since, let's be frank, most webpages only care to follow US laws
I let out a small little *fuck
* and then I continue with my life
It also comes down to how each member enforces the article and adapts itw own legislation to it just like any other EU directive
On the other hand, it's understandable and desirable that countries have the ability to adapt a generic directive to their own specific conditions
Meat+mushrooms+Margherita base is quite standard in most mainstream pizzerias
Dipping crust, I hope
Donerkebab pizza
Doner just means spinning, and refers to food cooked on a spinning stick
I'm drooling right now
Oversalted fries really benefit from some sugar/vinegar mix like ketchup
It's usually too fatty
A good way to end up with a stomach reminding you all night of it, if you are past your teens
Pros: Weather, food, nightlife, maaaaany things to do
Cons: Awful wages compared to other countries, politics has been a shitshow since forever, streets aren't as clean as I would like
Concebollismo o muerte
Agreed
Bonus if you live on a main Street in Barcelona or a tourist-only town
I have never found [this] kind of blinds for windows in Northern Europe
Why
You have a very changing light duration along the year, it's ideal for you
I just can't get it, first days up there to sleep always is an issue for me
Same point by point
Pros: beer paradise
The country responsible for Chimay, Rochefort, Triple Karmeliet and Westvleteren deserves a spot in my heart
Food is really good
Iberian brothers
Bilbao is one of a kind, the best city in Spain in my opinion
Yeah when I see these people I'd like to throw their faces on the street too
Dog shit however has gotten WAY better over the years
In my experience virtually all dog owners clean after their dogs
Onion should be on onion
Not really, just a lot of people that vote for the public benefits
Maybe you are right
Actually I am not sure if the differences with Italy are so big but compared to other countries like Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands etc I don't see Spain significantly more progressive than them
We even have a right wing party (Vox) on the rise that wants harden border controls and deport all illegal inmigrants
Younger people tend to be more progressive but since all this came in such a short time (compared to other countries) these views get really different when you talk to older people, or even get borderline fascist
Right wing parties new and old are feeding on this situation (and on pure hate campaigns) so the situation is actually worse every year
A few years back you wouldn't think people would be gloryfying the Spanish Empire, and nowadays you can find weirdos with the cross of burgundy military flag on their backpacks
I can't think of a name for it, but I think it was a common thing to "go to London" to have an abortion a few decades ago
Celestina or Curandera, I'd say
Celestina
Like "La Celestina"?
Oh wait lol, that's not what I wanted to say
I meant to say "Casamentera", as it is said that they would also practice abortions, apart from getting people married, but yeah, I'd say curandera is more accurate
This soviet song: [Полюшко-поле (Polyushka Polye / Oh fields my fields)] goosebumps
The Red Army Choir performance is the best and the most known, but any performance, [even this weird version from Helene Fischer] with some verses in english, is still amazing
Another one is the Portuguese popular song [Grândola Vila Morena] , related to the carnation Revolution (it was, in fact, broadcasted on radio \[it was banned by the  dictatorship\] as a signal to begin it)
Erika is an absolute banger ngl, Bella ciao too since la casa de papel, katyoshka too, the basis for the blue division song primavera
Didnt they end it because it wasnt as profitable anymore
1) [**The Palomares nuclear accident**] was a nuclear accident that occurred in the Spanish town of Palomares, belonging to the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora (Almería), on 17 January 1966
In the historical context of the Cold War, two United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft, a tanker plane and a B-52 strategic bomber collided in flight during a refuelling manoeuvre
This resulted in the detachment and fall of the four thermonuclear bombs carried by the B-52, as well as the death of seven of the eleven crew members of both aircraft
2) [**The Prestige oil spill**] occurred off the coast of Galicia, Spain, caused by the sinking of the 26 year old structurally deficient oil tanker MV Prestige in November 2002
The spill polluted thousands of kilometers of coastline and more than one thousand beaches on the Spanish, French and Portuguese coast, as well as causing great harm to the local fishing industry
The spill is the largest environmental disaster in the history of both Spain and Portugal
The amount of oil spilled was more than the Exxon Valdez incident and the toxicity considered higher, because of the higher water temperatures
3) [**The 2011 Lorca earthquake**] (Spanish: Terremoto de Lorca de 2011) was a moderate 5
1 Mw earthquake that occurred on 11 May 2011 causing significant localized damage in the Region of Murcia, Spain, and panic among locals, and displacing many from their homes
The [1962 Riadas del Vallés] (wikipedia in Spanish) are one of the most famous floodings in the history of Spain, between 600-1000 people died
It rained a lot and very suddenly after a period of drought, and since a lot of towns had built small houses made with cheap materials right next to the rivers everything was destroyed when the rivers overflowed
It affected a lot of buildings in Spain like churches and abyss
It was a huge fact in the History for us Spanish people too
Not one of the most famous, but one I remember reading about after my parents mentioned it when we walked past the place where it happened is [Los Alfaques disaster] in which 217 people died and 200+ were injured after a tanker truck exploded near a campsite
Warning: Google shows some disturbing NSFW pictures
Yeah
I always wondered why the stain glass of Plasencia's cathedral was so crappy
Turns out that the old one was destroyed during the earthquake
And the church of Granada
Really far from Lisbon
That's really far
Sangría and churros
I personally like both a lot but I don't think it's that common in a Spanish table
- Sangría is sometimes drank in the summer, but I'd say most people prefer to have an ice cold beer
- Churros or porras would be like a special sunday breakfast, but I don't think it's what a Spaniard would usually have for breakfast, specially the ones that have breakfast at home
They are both fairly popular, there's always people at churrerías, and people will indeed order sangria in a restaurant
But they are probably not your day to day option
Definitely "paella". In some regions is very usal but in the rest of the country it's something you once a year practically
in Madrid: Callos a la Madrileña. It's supposed to be our regional dish¹ but almost no one eats it regularly nowadays
Here you have a pic
It's basically a tripe stew
Many people are put off by the texture
Tbh I can't say I'm a fan
As for Spain
Foreigners go too hardcore on tapas restaurants and paella
We don't eat them that often². Same with sangria and churros
Sangria is pretty unpopular overall
Churros IS regarded as a treat
Paella and tapas (whole dinner) are regional
Elsewhere in the country you might eat them once or twice a year
But tell me some dishes you associate with us and I'll tell you how often we eat them
¹contested with cocido
²depending on the region
Yeah, what lots of people drink during summer is tinto de verano, which is red wine mixed with either lemon soda or sparkling water
I would say churros are more common than sangría. I've literally never witnessed anybody ordering sangría, it's always tinto de verano or beer
However churros is something you do occasionally as a fun Sunday plan or whatever
Like going for brunch
Completely agree, I acknowledge sangria as a typical Spanish drink, but I can count with my fingers the amount of times I've had it
Love it though
Tinto de verano is a cheaper version of sangria that is what people order here in summer
I totally agree about sangría. It's the kind of thing a teenager would drink briefly when they are just starting to drink alcohol
I don't remember ever going out with friends and someone ordering sangría, it's just not what we drink at all
I much prefer tinto de verano with Casera
I disagree somewhat about churros
At least in Madrid, it is the tradition to eat them for breakfast on the 1st of January (hangover cure), and people do eat them every now and then (not necessarily for breakfast), mostly in the winter
Spain and Italy united against spaghetti with meatballs and paella with chorizo
&#x200B;
because in other parts of spain we dont eat paella, we eat things with rice :)
If we count tapas, its very easy to eat paella weekly (as long as there is no global pandemic)
And eating "yellow rice with stuff" and calling it paella for short, is very common, I would say weekly/monthly in most parts of the country
IMO churros are only appropriate to have with your friends at 8 AM after partying all night
No way, Los Serrano
Please tell me you lived in Spain or something
If Los Serrano aired in Finnish TV I don't know what's real anymore
Just to clarify, it's Casera, not sparkling water (slightly different things)
Casera is the best
I like sangría and have drunk it often enough, but yeah, it's not that widespread
Beer is king
I prefer sangría mainly for its fruity flavor, but in that category tinto is better because it tastes less like alcohol
Sangría is better if you want more alcohol for your buck, of course
Churros are too heavy to eat as a dessert, considering that you have already eaten
They are usually eaten on their own at breakfast with a drink, most commonly dipped in hot chocolate
In my region they're also usually eaten in the middle of the afternoon in summer (19:00 or 20:00 pm), because there is a long time between lunch (14:00 or 15:00 pm) and dinner (22:00 pm or even later)
They are sold in paper cartridges, sprinkled with sugar, and you eat them as you walk along the promenade watching the sunset
Andalusian around here, in my family its tradition to have onion soup every year at Easter, and sometimes also at Christmas
Maybe it's something more southern or maybe not, because I don't know many people who have this tradition (mainly because they don't like that soup), but in my university canteens they used to put onion soup on the menu from time to time and also in the menu bar where I used to go to eat in my previous job
¯\_O_/¯
I'm from Valencia and I eat it in every family gathering
Ahora vivo en Inglaterra y no te vas a creer las veces que he visto mierda mezclada con arroz llamada 'paella' en las tiendas
I would say that the most common paella here is "mixta": rice, vegetables and chicken, rabbit, prawns and mussels
Then there is the traditional Valencian paella, which is prepared without seafood
Sometimes I've seen fish paella (monkfish instead of chicken and rabbit), but it's not very common
Great investment of tax-payer's money tbh
Gracias, buen yankee, por ayudarnos con la guerra contra el diablo
Hahaha, era todo un puto sueño de Resines
If you're ear rings (tinnitus
), someone is gossiping about you
If a black cat crosses the street in front of you, it's bad luck
If you don't want something bad that you just said happening, touch wood (any kind of wood)
If you're a bad kid, the Three Mage Kings (from the bible) will only bring you coal as a present on the 6th of January
If one of your teeth falls as a kid, the ratoncito Pérez (little mouse Pérez) will trade it for money
Don't open an umbrella inside the house
If you put your handbag on the floor, your money will go away (your finances will be bad)
Edit: I forgot my favourite one
If someone is sweeping the floor and they accidentally sweep over your feet with the broom, you won't get married
Oh, and if a bird shits on you, it's good luck ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
*Wearing some red garment on new year's eve brings good luck
(Specially underwear)
*If you rob a thief you have 100 years of good luck
*If you break a mirror the following 7 year will bring you bad luck
We have a bunch, some I know:
For bad luck:
* Walking under a ladder
* Breaking a mirror
* Making a toast with water
* Spilling salt
* Getting out of the bed with the left foot
* Being gift with a knife (when somebody gifts you a knife you are supposed to pay at least some cents so it's not a gift)
* Being looked at by a one eyed person
* Pointing at a pumpkin of supposed to kill that pumpkin
For good luck:
* Stepping on shit
* Rubbing a lottery ticket on a pregnant belly or on a humpback's hump
* Wearing red underwear for new year's eve
* Put something made of gold in your glass for new year's eve toast
* On st John's day night (June 23rd) we celebrate it traditionally in the beach, and you have to jump 3 waves
Also in Spain the day of bad luck is Tuesday 13th instead of friday 13th
Oranges in the morning are gold, in the afternoon they're silver and at night they kill you
&#x200B;
We say the same about olives
oof we got that one too
also i've heard that many old people here believe that if you're making funny faces and the wind changes, you'll be stuck with that face forever
&#x200B;
honestly wtf
I doubt there is a thief robbing spanish guide but perhaps we should first define what does good luck mean
I would say that the severity of the good luck you are given is proportional to how much did you steal and how much did the thief you roobed theft before
I know it's confusing, no one said being spanish was easy
We could also agree that if you rob a thief you are allowed to break an aprox of 14,3 mirrors
Always:
Literature - green
Maths - red
Geography/history - blue
Science - yellow
And the rest depends on the subjects and the years
Red for maths
Blue for Spanish
Green for sciences
Not folders, but notebooks:
Math - Yellow; Sciences/history - Green; Spanish - Red; Galician - blue; Second language - purple
Those are the basics for me
ooohh i got it, we used to do this in primary school but with notebooks
Now most of us use one folder for everything, but this is how we did it in our class:
math - red
spanish - yellow
biology/nature shit - green (obv)
english - dark blue
valencian (the language) - light blue
history/social shit - orange
&#x200B;
edit: and then a small nasty yellow one for religion, because no one cares about it
Red: mathematics
Orange: physical
Yellow: technology
Green: science
Blue: language
Purple: music
Pink: art
Brown: history, geography, social studies
- Math - blue
- Literature - red + orange (2 languages)
- English - yellow
- Physics - Purple
- Chemistry - Green
- "Technical drawing" - grey
- History - dark red/brown
- Computer science - plastic sheaths
- industrial tech - plastic sheaths
Edit: back in "bachillerato", and not folders but notebooks
Last time someone brought this on twitter we almost start another civil war
I think I'm gonna pass this one
I had 6 different colours twice so I used yellow for catalan/history, orange for spanish/philosophy, red for maths/technology, green for science/religion, light blue for english/P.E., dark blue for german/random stuff
It would've been a good idea to add a picture of what you meant haha
If it's [this] you're talking about, then I only recall using purple folders for music and art ([like this one] I don't know if it was because those were the ones they sold at the paper store we'd go to purchase most of my school material or because I used very few folders and those were sold individually
For anything else I'd buy packets of paper or one of those notebooks with holes and store them on my file folder thing, the one with the dangerous rings that could snap a finger in two
I don't remember which color I assigned to each subject on those separators
At one point I stopped using individual folders and I started using one of these:  [
Mine didn't have color tags
I never color-coded anything, it was random every year
Only people with OCD would do that
The main downside of living in Spain is alredy widely known: lack of jobs, which also makes wages lower due to this supply-demand thingy
Honestly I am quite surprised Germans and Brits complained about wages here
You may not be Norway but at least you aren't Southern Europe :(
Rooki numbers
18:02 here
It's nice enough but the sun has just started to get up so there's the downside
I was paid almost the double of what I could get in Spain for a not-really-that-qualified IT job in Slovakia
Two-thousand upwards salaries are hard to come by even in positions which require uni degrees (engineering
), because they have gotten us used to it with the recent crisis
Why bother paying a good salary when you got hundreds of fresh graduates willing to take the position at any cost
It’s already very depressing to see no sun at 18, I can’t imagine living up north
Honestly I would enjoy the sun raising 30-45 earlier
When I drive to school it looks like 2:00
I'd say a provincial capital like Granada
Even tho some autonomic capitals like Seville, Bilbao or Valencia are liked by the rest of the country, it seems like anybody else in their autonomous region hates them
Granada is a great smaller city, with a big student life, close to mountains and the sea, the mother fucking Alhambra, the Albaicin, etc
For Spain I would say Andalucía, the southest part of Europe
It is the region with the best weather, one of the best gastronomy (if not the best), nice people, cheaper than almost any other region in the country, and you can find whatever sort of entertainment you are looking for: there is fantastic beaches, historical tourism, hipster and trendy cities, snowy mountains, deserts regions, a lot of nature reserves
The foreign tourists choose Andalucía as the best part of the country as well
Maybe TOLEDO for Spain
Or Cordoba
Definitely none of the bigger regional capitals as everyone claims to be the best
I loved Ghent as well when I was there a couple of years ago
In fact I'm considering doing my Erasmus next year in a school that the University of Leuven has there
What's the reason
I don´t think it´s necessary hate, it´s just that Berlin and Munich are sooooo different that it´s normal for ones to just dislike the atmosphere of the other city
And politics also don´t help with that as there´s always the CDU-CSU rope pull
But being born in Munich it´s not like people hate Berlin, just most of the ones who go don´t like the vibes
Yep
I was about to say Granada
And maybe Asturias, Gijón has a very good reputation too (even though I can remember they hate Oviedo
Ill go for the Canary Islands
I've never heard anyone say anything bad about Valencia, the city
But everyone says Valencianos are cold and more stand-offish
While this hasn't been my personal experience with Valencianos, every time I bring up the fact that I want to move there, the first thing everyone says is "oh but what about the people there
Madrileños are so much nicer
" I wonder if that might just be classic Madrileño superiority though
That kinda makes me like it more lol
They do, i went to college in Gijón while my sister went to Oviedo and both cities had some hate that you could see on posters, grafittis and my sister even found a "puta Gijón" written in one of the tables in the university
From what i see in Gijón the hate comes from the fact that people  from Oviedo are posh, classist and consider themselves better than the rest of Asturias just because they are the capital and have "more culture" than the rest of us
Gotta say i kinda agree with Gijón on this one but since i've been living here a few years i might not be impartial
Yeah, but Bilbao is the city tht suffers the "capital hatred" syndrome, kinda like NYC in New York instead of Albany
Revilla isn't precisely impartial, is he
And with Asturias right next to Cantabria
Quien no conoce a Dios, a cualquier santo le reza
A lot of people in the Valencian Autonomous Community (Alicante, Castellón, etc) have some hate for Valencia often
And in addition to that
I've seen in other regions of Spain negative impressions about Valencia because corruption, "maletines", Rita or unsustainable tourism
Architecture
My school has made me used to loads of work and all-nighters so I won't worry about that lol
Yeah, this year filomena (a snow storm) completely collapsed the northern half of Spain
Madrid was hit specially hard, just because snow in Madrid is pretty rare
They got about half a meter of snow and everything collapsed
No garbage removal, roads closed, trees fallen,... They had to move my exams two weeks up ahead
I went a week later and my college was In shambles
My departments drawing room ceiling had collapsed under the snow
In my town, which regularly gets snow, everything was fine by day 2
I know I should do it in English, but most of the time I don't. I'm studying, so my teachers:
a) wouldn't understand it
b) would think I just copied the code from the internet
I guess once I'm a professional I'll do it in English all of the time
I do always write in English my code, README, comments
I also search errors and tutorials in English
Mostly spanish/catalan (in university)
English if it is meant to be professional code or public project, both for names and comments/documentation, otherwise it can be seen as unprofessional and can pose a challenge to proper understanding within international teams
However, I often try to duplicate documentation at least in Spanish (not only because it is my first language, it is also the second language in the world by native speakers so I guess it makes sense)
When the code and comments are for some small personal project or dumb tinkering then I end up mixing whatever goes through my head
I use both English and Spanish when I'm writing for myself, and for the most part switch to English only if I'm sharing the code
It helps that in my job 90% of my scripts are only going to be used by me lol
Is it easy learning Russian knowing Serbian
Thanks for the answer
By the way, I just realized how little I know about Eastern Europe history
What is their anti-union stance there
Do they fire people if they are found to be members of an union or something like that
Genuinely asking because doing these things in Spain at the very least is a guarantee of a permanent strike or even going to the judges (if the workers care that is)
In Spain about 50 years ago there was a lot of difference between sexes
There were single sex schools untill college
But nowadays almost all of schools are mixed schools and there is a lot of social context to go wit friends, from either sex, like going for a drink or coffee
So yes, absolutely
It's pretty normal, especially as you grow up
I'm in high school and I was surprised to see how while Spanish girls and boys socialize together and it's no big deal, our German exchange students would feel uncomfortable when doing anything with someone of the opposite sex
Of course, but its mostly that one wierd guy who everyone thinks is gay
Of course
If it's an unknown number:
¿Diga
Imperative of "to say", second person formal
Or ¿Si
(Yes
If it's a known person I talk like in a normal conversation face to face
Old people will awnser with their family name but young people will awnser just with a hellow or tell me
You'd say "¿sí?", which means "yes
", or "¿dígame
" more formally, meaning "tell me
The only correct way is "dígamelón", a combination of "tell me" and "melon"
How old you have to be to answer like that
+100 yo
My grandparents never answer like that
Im just 17 almost 18 lol
Technically in 1492, but it had been formed since the start of the Reconquista
More or less 528 years
That was a really productive year tho
Well, the name and the concept of Spain (Hispania) came from the romans, but officialy Spain was founded in 1479
10 years before, in 1469 Isabel de Castilla got married with Fernando de Aragon and in 1479, when they actually became in Queen of Castilla and King of Aragon, the unified the two kingdoms
In 1492 they completed the unification conquering Granada, the last area with muslims
The same year, the kings approved the trip of Cristobal Colon, who ended up finding America
That was a great century for us
It's complicated
The first time the government of Castilla and Aragon was unified was in 1479, when Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla married, unifying both crowns
But at this time it wasn't **a** country, each part had its own institutions and its own ruler
The first time there was a *king* of Castilla and Aragon was in 1516, Carlos I (Charles V in Germany), but again, the institutions were separated
Spain as a single government started in 1707, with the Nueva Planta decrees, imposed by Felipe V.
It's tough to say, because many argue Castille or even Asturias can also be considered a proto-Spain, so the answer would be years 1065 and 718 respectively
But that's just politically
I'd say the basis of Spanish identity goes as far back as the Romans, culturally, religiously and, mostly liguistically (obviously), so we could say it all started with the end of the Second Punic War in 201 BCE
I don't really see how could you consider Castile or Asturias to be "proto-Spain", that would be like Prussia or Brandenburg being "proto-Germany".
Drywalls in homes
I think that's not legal here, you can make a hole just punching it, it's definitely not safe
For everything else, you always use your car or always there is someone with a van or a smal truck (something this size
When you buy bulky items, the store will deliver it to your home and even install it
If I buy in Ikea I always check the size to be sure it will fit in my car, I haven't had any problems yet, if someday I need something bigger I'd rent a van or hire someone with a van
If it fits in my car, then the car
Otherwise delivery as it's usually cheap, or a friend's van
And if none of those work (his van isn't that large), we rent a large van
That's what she said
They are expensive cars that need a lot of gas (which is very expensive in comparison to USA, about 1
5 USD per litre, more than 6 per gallon)
So if you have money for that you end buying a BMW, Audi or any other highend sedan/SUV
weak walls, you'll see drywals used for offices and simmilar instalations, but not for homes
yeah, it's known as pladur (it's a name brand used for the stuff even if it's not for the branded one) here
It's used for workplaces, offices, that kind of stuff
Nobody wants a wall you can remove with a punch in their home here
I'm saying they are very easy to be broken
Here you won't find houses like that (I mean is very very uncommon, maybe someone liked and did it, or maybe a centuries old home restored) Here houses are made with bricks and cement, if it has beams like [this] they are probably decorative, not functional or part of the structure
I bought a home last year and before painting I embedded a big gutter in the wall with one big junction box in each extreme
Then I painted over it
I did this where the TV was supposed to go mostly for future use and you cannot see it unless you move the TV or the furniture underneath and remove the cover of the junction box
My forearm fits inside
So it's very convenient to run any kind of cable with any kind of connector within the wall
As someone who spent some time in NZ I was astonished by how British the country felt to me
I hope you at one point attempted the earth sandwich down there (NZ and Spain are exact antipodes)
I spent some time in Australia and I really wanted to go to NZ solely to drink a beer on the exact side of the planet from Madrid - Weber, NZ (a bit east of Palmerston North) for anyone interested
For the record
I never made it to NZ
Edit: along the lines of your original comment, I was surprised how NOT British Australia felt
I was expecting it to "feel" a bit more British but I felt more like I was in the USA - that goes for Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in my opinion
Yeah I think it really does come down to infrastructure - more suburbial type layouts where people live outside the city centers and you have to drive everywhere on freeways
Everything is much more spread out (and newer) than in the UK, which gives it a more American like feel
That would be unimaginable here, so we never learnt to cook in school
Never had it in Spain
My mother has taught me at home
And she did recently, when I was in my late teens
Why would they teach me earlier anyways
We don't have cooking classes at school and I honestly don't think it's necessary
It's the kind of things your parents should teach you
Same here
My school didn't have kitchen or canteen
To the point that I have some female friends that are *proud* of the fact that they can’t cook
Who cares that it’s a vital life skill
It’s not like you are going to move out of your parents’ house anytime soon, amiright
(people are weird sometimes)
To me what's weird is having cooking classes at school lol
Yeah but in Spain very few kids have lunch at school because classes end before lunch at 14-14:30
Only those whose parents get out of work later eat at school so in smaller ones there's no canteen
I mean, that does explain learning things like that earlier, but it doesn't explain why it's taught at school
I mean we can't complain, getting the citizenship her in Spain is hard as balls
But in my humble (and uninfomed) opinion people should pass a basic level exam on the country's main language and some culture
That's like the bare minimum
I'd like to hear some arguments against this
I think they should be able to speak fluently the language (It doesn’t matter the accent) and to have a basic knowledge about the country history
So, I’m totally against it
You should not be granted the citizenship if you don’t talk the main language across the country
Completely against, if you want to become Spanish, you must speak Spanish fluently, it's just logical, our national language is Spanish, so at least learn the national one, learn it
I think at least a decent level of proficiency should be required as part of the citizenship process
Although I would say it could vary quite a lot depending on the country and citizenship requirements
Here in Spain if you have no other connection to Spain (e.g. Spanish partner / relative) then you have to live here for 10 years to apply for citizenship
Given that amount of time before you can even apply for nationality, I think it's reasonable to expect a pretty good level of Spanish
The requirement however is a B1 level if I remember right which personally seems a little bit low
If the requirement were only 5 years of residency then I think it'd be perfectly fine, learning a language takes a long time and once you know a certain level it's more up to you how much you want to integrate yourself into the culture and how much effort you want to put in
Without the language pretty difficult to do anything here
im pretty sure that Spain requires applicants to take a Spanish history/culture exam at the Cervantes institute in Spanish when you apply for citizenship by descent
Italy has ahd a lot of diasporas and they think that giving the citizenship is good for they country (even wuth greatgranparents)
Here in spain you only get the nationality if you are son of a spaniard and for most vountries it requires 10 years of legal residency in spain
This
You are totally right
Well, i get it if they are retired people
It's good manners to learn the language but if we are being honest they are offered all the sevices in english so why bother
Yes, but it's as easy as the driving test
30 test type questions or so
One of the most plausible scenarios is requiring British immigrants to get a signed contract or ask for a special permission that demonstrates they are legally allowed to stay in the country for a certain period of time ( i guess that they can also elongate their stay by renovating their permits)
If they don't they'll probably get kicked out of the country immediately and they would need to apply directly from the UK, which means they are going to lose some solid ten years of their lives just to see a single sad spanish sunray again (i'm pretty sure the Spanish government will put a lot of burocratic obstacles to permissions sent directly from Britain)
I'm sure Spain will allow them to stay
they are old people passing their last years in Spain
They love spending their money here and we love it too
It's just free money
Mexico and Spain are different countries
If you would learnt about history you would know that, so you shouldn’t be granted the citizenship
In the cities most people speak Spanish, this regional languages are more a rural thing
Well some people refuse to speak spanish because of the nationalist feelings
When I was a child I went into a store in Salou (Catalonia) and the clerk refused to speak to me in spanish
but I think they might only do it with other spanish people
(Not everyone does this, only the assholes, and if you are a foreigner I think theyll speak with you in spanish, or english if they can) Never been to Euskadi so I dont know
Happens very rarely
The spanish diaspora is almost non-existant and the vast majority of them are from southamerica, so the language is not a problem
I like other accents, makes the whole thing richer
But in Reddit is really easy to find people who say that meaning it haha so without /s I cannot tell if it’s a joke or not :(
I think it doesn’t matter your accent, the important part is communication
Some accents are more slang than accent so in those cases I would be somehow strict but as long as is just a different accent and some changes in use of words (as it happens in Mexican Spanish and Castillian Spanish) I think there’s no problem
He didn't say anything about Cataluña... and I'm sure that in Palma the majority speaks Spanish
What point
Nationality by bloodline
It's pretty standard
Idk, totally subjective i guess
It depends on what are you looking for
In Europe from one country to another there’s almost always a change in language and some differences on culture
Everything is compatible but you should aim for what you like or prioritise as it might be easier in some European countries
As your wife holds Irish citizenship you should be able to live or work in any EU state
That's not a debate cause it's just stupid
Welcome to the two EUs
Wtf
Here you buy your supplies and everything is 100% yours
If teachers want to use your work for anything they must have a signed  authorization first
Never heard of this before
Definitely not a thing in Spain
In all of Spain it may vary but in my town it's to say hello to them, you may talk or one who may want to help you on something but to be honest, I don't say anything to them and I keep a distance
Smile and say hello as we pass eachother in the elivator
That's it
I feel like in my community it varies
In my old building there were only retired and elderly people, they were very old fashioned and would all go out together and stuff, I loved it and even interviewed many of them for pleasure, they were incredibly nice people
In my new building we are mostly young adults or adults and we have a casual chat when we see each other, I even helped a neighbor produce sounds for an independent film he made :) but it's not as "old timey polite" as it was in my old building
Don't you need to reorganize the furniture of your house every night
I think this is a city vs town kind of situation
In the city you usually don't go further than saying hi in the elevator
11Km, 45 minutes by bike
It’s like a town full of just companies, Tech Park we call it
Madrid, Spain here
10 minute walk to the subway
15 minutes to my stop (thank god I don't have to switch trans)
5 minute walk to my destination
All in all, around 30 minutes
I could probably go on foot and it would take me around 40 minutes, but crossing through the centre at rush hour is not the most pleasant thing in the world
I have a remote job, so about 10 seconds from bed to the computer
40 min
bus + 5 min
walk /
~30 min
by car, depending on the traffic
I wake up, walk out of my bedroom into the kitchen/ living room area to make some coffee
Sometimes I even put pants on, but not always
Then I open the door to my home office and get to it
As cool as it sounds, working from home has gotten me down a bit lately though
It's hard to motivate myself, and it's hard without the human interaction every day, so I'm beginning to look for a small office somewhere in the city center
It's nice to have the option to work from home, but it's a bit isolating if it's your only option
I shared an office with 3 other freelancers for a few years, but this year I have been dealing with a long distance relationship and spending a lot of time in another country, so I've avoided paying rent on an office, but having just returned from almost 3 months abroad, I really need to start getting out there more
It's 45 minutes between walking, bus and metro
But I spend most of the time sitting so I guess it could be worse
It's very sunny here so it's quite lovely to walk around now that the butterflies and bees are starting to appear
Madrid, 45 minutes combining walk+bus in the morning and walk+metro in the afternoon
Mountainous part of Northern Spain
25 km and 250 m total elevation gain one way
I can go by car in 20 mins or by bike in 50-55 mins
I almost always go by bike
It's from the kitchen, with a cup of coffee, across the living room, and into my home office
25min walking, pretty pleasant, a bit more crowded in the evening and the summer
This is in Barcelona
I think we work at the same place
I am so jealous rn
This sounds exhausting
You have my respect
I wouldn't show up for work
Are you being sarcastic or genuinely asking
No, Parque tecnologico de Álava
it's cool I just ran down to the shop and got more capsules
We got almond milk and regular milk in the fridge
What are you thinking for lunch
It was a joke
Your commuting just sounds exhausting
I think it's pretty natural not knowning what it even means
I was surprised English had a word for something so particular when I learned it
I'd like to add that I think the fact that the English-speaking culture developed the need for a word for such a specific concept is pretty sad
It shows how ingrained wasting your life away in the forth/back home/work journey is in their culture (and expandingly into ours and others) and how normal it is viewed
You seem like my kinda office mate
There's no word for it
You'd have to describe it
I find the polish/slovenian Maja really beautiful name, and the pronunciation, plus, as an spaniard, written in spanish it means "very outgoing" Or "nice person" Hahaha
Also polish Piotr somehow sounds much stronger and i really like it much more than peter or pedro
>Karl, Friedrich
I really like these too
Especially in that particular order somehow
Same
I already said it in another thread, Irish female names in general are incredibly beautiful and I wish I could name my hypothetical daughter with one of them
I love lithuanian natural nameslike that
Audra means storm and it's a common name there, it's so awesome :D
I advise you against searching Simon's equivalent
Good to know, sorry
Late 20s, our youth unemployment is ridiculous, rents are high and employments for young people pay shit
Having a university degree doesn't mean that a job with a decent living salary will appear
Living on your own and young is like a dream
I'm always so blown away for how in other European countries some move so early even in their teen years
The average age is 29 years old in Spain, 26 years old in Europe (Eurostat)
I think it's because we're more family-focused as a society and because of the average income compared to the average price of renting a house
Other countries:
**Norway:** 19,3 years old
**Denmark:** 21 years old
**Sweden:** 21 years old
**Finland:** 21,9 years old
**Belgium:** 23,4 years old
**Netherlands:** 23,6 years old
**Germany:** 23,7 years old
**France:** 24 years old
**UK:** 24,4 years old
**Austria:** 25,2 years old
**Ireland
** 26,3 years old
**Hungary:** 27,4 years old
**Portugal:** 29,2 years old
**Spain:** 29,3 years old
**Greece:** 29,4 years old
**Italy:** 30 years old
**Croatia:** 31,9 years old
**Montenegro:** 32,5 years old
Some years ago the average age of young people moving somewhere else in Spain was about 30-32
Don't know if it has changed since then
It is\* better than in 2012, but 14% is still quite high
Not to mention the 35% youth unemployment and low wages
Which is kinda 'funny', because the last elections' debate wasn't about unemployment, but social issues
I only see a correlation between how far north the country is and how long kids/young adults stay at home
Exactly
The byzantine emperor sold his title to the Spanish crown before the turks defeated him
Technically our King is also emperor of the Romans
Back in the day, there was a plan for the Spanish Empire to invade and take over China
[Spanish army's rifle until 1999] was made by a former enginneer from Nazi Germany
The rifle itself started development by Mauser in 1945 until Germany lost the war
Many of the engineers escaped to Francoist Spain, and were crucial to the further development of the prototype
Spain also used many clones & licensed versions of WW2 german aircraft, such as the ["Buchon"] (Bf 109 with a bigger local engine) or spanish-made [Junkers 52] not very different from the same Ju 52 that made Franco able to move his troops from north africa to Spain in 1936 and win the Spanish Civil War
These WW2 designs were used long after becoming obsolete, in some cases due to external factors like USA telling Spain not to use american armament in the [Sidi Ifni war] therefore making all of the Spannish aircraft be WW2-era
Even 30's tanks like [T-26] captured durinng the civil war, were used until the 50's by Spain, since it was the best thing around
I already knew this story
It's still my favorite in this post (which is fascinating BTW)
I once read that the main export of some German principalities was royal spouses
What a power move
I think the titles apply to any person holding the crown not to the person itself
Because our King could not have all those titles as we changed kings a few times
The title passed in the iberian wedding
And I believe it was the king of Aragon mostly because Aragon had a strong Mediterranean presence
It's a nonsense metric anyway
I heard it long time ago but I can't remember where
My guess is that it must had been in a short stories book, classic history or literature classes or something in that vein, but I can't recall for sure
Of course
I can tell you that the title of "King of Jerusalem is a lie". However the byzantine title is true
In The Vampire Diaries (the backdoor episode) or already in The Originals
One of the characters was using Google translate to get some witch spell translated and there was a image of her choosing one language at the end and it was Galician
We had a good laugh about it because it was with suspenfull music and it ended in a "clifhanger" without knowing if it was or not Galician
I once watched a news story in my local paper about the Nintendo Spanish translator that lives in Japan and is from my home town of Granada
I’ve recognized some expressions and he uses Andalusian when characters speak with an accent in the original Japanese
It’s quite funny
Aren't there a lot of Australians of Irish ancestry
At least some must've kept the motherland's language
He uses it to translate country-style speech in RPGs
I think it’s lovely
Yeah but a few people might be able to speak it
Or at least a couple of words
An outrage for doing wrong a regional accent
Is there an outrage every time a British historical drama has English actors playing foreign characters speaking with terrible fake accents both in English and in other languages
I can't believe I have to say this (again) but
jobs
Specially unqualified ones
People don't seem to comprehend what a high unemployment rate means
And in the Spanish subs we're tired of talking down all those youngsters who believe they can come here and live off odd jobs and out of the system for a few months while traveling
No, dude, that doesn't work that way any more, if ever
Informal work is scarce, pays peanuts, and it's primed for abuse specially if you want to skip bureaucracy and be paid under the table
Not to mention that rents are high, employers and landlords want commitments, you'll have a ton of  competitors, and, most importantly, you need to speak Spanish
Weed
So much posts asking about to get weed in r/Madrid and r/Spain
Also, love for bullfighting
It's in decline and only live with subsidies due to extremely low attendance
Siesta
It's quite common in Southern Spain where you can't just go out after lunch in summer, but in most regions I've been siesta is only common among older people
Flamenco
Most of the people dont know shit about and is not a very popular kind of music anymore
That we're extroverts, always happy, funny and love to party people
In Spain there are a lot of types of people, including introverts, shy and calm people, just like everywhere else
Bullfights
Como otro spaniard redditor, te entiendo y te comprendo
No sé qué carajos se piensan los guiris y extranjeros para querer venirse a vivir a España sin tener ni papa del país o del idioma
Regarding the second,
Even in places where it is done "regularly" it is something that happens during town festivities and the like
So an average town will likely go between 360 and 364 days a year without a bullfight
Go some "non regular" place and it is perfectly normal to go years without bullfighting
However, in foreign shows they treat it like it's the local equivalent of football
Which leads is to
Bullfighting is not, and was never meant to be, a sport
Let alone some "fair" competition between man and animal
If you wish otherwise you might as well go to a slaugherhouse and complain that the pigs don't have a chance to run away
What about snails
Well, you should see Spanish movies from the 90s. If you don't see a dick or a scene of sexual intercourse, it's probably not a Spanish film
I don't remember if the movies of [Jamón Jamón] or [Lucía y el sexo] actually show dicks, but they're pretty representative examples of Spanish films from that time
They are pretty common in Spain
Interestingly, every house I've lived in here in Spain has one
And I don't think I've even used one 5 times
Any house with a bathroom made before 2005 in Spain usually has one
The ones made on the last years tend to use the [American method] or none
Not really sure it counts given that I'd argue those are Swedish jobs but in a different country but I'll concede working here is definitely easier for some
Certainly not if you are young, have no experience, don't speak the language and yet somehow expect to live comfortably in Spain while bartending a few hours on weekends, which is what way too many people plan to do
Maybe, but your bullfighting seems a lot less cruel from what I've seen
It's more about acrobatics and courage, [like this] right
Check out this [video] (warning: animal cruelty)
This is how it's usually done in Spain, they nail small pikes on the back of the bull to get it to slow down and get tired due to pain and blood loss
What you see in the hand of the bullfighter on the video is a real sword
They use it to cut the bulls ear as a prize when the bull has already fallen to the floor, exhausted
Then there's *rejoneo* with horses, which could be nice if it was just fooling around with the horse, but they also spike the bull making it bleed all over the place
Look at the bulls back on [this video] how shiny it is from the blood
I honestly hope we will forget about this Spanish shameful "tradition" as soon as possible
I went out for beers when I was 14 and no one ever asked for my ID
In big cities they might be more serious about it but my casual small town bars don't give a fuck
In the states they're super strict on that right
Like if you look under 30 they have to check ID or something
You can't buy alcohol under 18 but nobody will stop you drinking at home
Are people really expecting to get contact information for an illegal activity by asking anonimously in the internet
It's also quite common in Spain
Some Spanish regions eat them, but they're not common on the whole country
That's interesting, I'll have to check it out
Oh, I don't think we have censorship here either, but we do have a "children's schedule" between 6:00 and 22:00
I think it's forbidden by law to show content that could damage children's development during those hours
It probably includes sexual scenes, but it's mostly oriented to prevent kids from accidentally watching extreme violence, abuse, drug addiction, etc
Anything traumatising in general
There's no censorship at night, as far as I've seen
They usually show a warning with the age recommendation before movies
Boobs are kinda normal on Spanish TV anyway, we don't feel offended by nipples
The first boob that appeared on our TV was probably the one from the italian singer [Sabrina in 1987] That one was pretty famous
Haha I just called them American because that's what I've heard from some people that work doing house renovation projects
The truth is that I don't know if everybody calls them that way in my country of if they are actually popular in America
They're becoming popular here lately, since they're more comfortable than bidets and occupy less space
That happens a lot in Spain too
Most people don't even think they're being racist when they say bad stuff about gipsies
There's an Andalucía flair, what the fuck
Me lo pongo ahora mismo
Edit: just found out it's custom
It's the Nigerian flag, can't you add your own custom flags
I'd want to, but my family disagrees
Will try to watch it tomorrow
We are in the middle of family activities, they wouldn't appreciate it xD
So in 1808, for complex reasons, a large group of people assaulted the royal complex of Aranjuez looking for prime minister Godoy
They found him days later, hiding inside a rolled-up  carpet
[Sobrino de Botín ]
It’s the oldest restaurant in the world that’s still in business
It was founded in 1725 and it’s in Madrid close to Plaza Mayor
Modern parliamentarism is considered by the UNESCO to have first appeared in the *Cortes* (General Estates) of León in 1188, tho
Croquetas
I thought that they were eaten everywhere, but then not many people I've spoken to know what they are
Kissing twice on the cheeks when you introduce yourself
I thought ir was doing everywhere
Pretty embarrasing first time I travelled abroad and tried to kissed every stranger I met
Lemon fanta
The spanish persianas, it's a beefed up version of the blinds, that looks like it's only common in Spain
Most of the typical Spanish food comes from very particular places
For example paella is typical from Valencia
Although it is true that you can find typical food everywhere around Spain
People have no idea about this though
I thought that every country's stores stopped for a midday break and lunch until 4-5 PM
Growing up in South Africa it was a thing for glass bottles (as a youngster I used to scavenge bottles for the deposit to buy sweets)
But it disappeared after plastic became common
Well, I don't think we have those in Spain, but we do have regional recipes of crêpes, like the [frisuelos] from Asturias or filloas from Galicia
We make a roll with them to eat them (we eat them with our hands if we are at home), I haven't seen people do that at France
The most shocking recipe for filloas (not for everybody, I guess) is probably [the one that uses pig's blood]
This one has a lot to do with the cultural importance that the pig slaughtering day (matanza) had on small villages back in the day
It was a festive day because it meant that the family would have plenty of meat (meat used to be a luxury back then, especially for those who were poor) for the whole year (chorizo and spanish ham last for months easily)
Every part of the pig that could be eaten was used and valued
Edit: we also have a sweet for a religious day, the day when the three wise men (the Magi
Not sure how it's said in English) were supposed to go see Jesus
It's called the [roscón de reyes] and it usually has a bean and a small figurine of a king hidden inside it
I think you would have to be carrying a lot of it and the cops would need to have proof that you're selling it to get jail time for it in Spain
If there's no evidence that you're selling it and you don't have much on you, you'll probably just get an expensive fine if you get caught
I wouldn't risk it though, although I know a lot of people that get away with it regularly
It's a mash of various ingredients (jamón is the most common) and bechamel, covered in flour and fried
[Example]
It's not the same thing
Check out this recipe:
Most people don't use butter for cooking in Spain though
We usually prefer olive oil
I don't get the reference haha, what's in common between croquetas and FIFA19
They're not exactly the same thing
Here's a recipe that is more or less traditional:
That would be extremely tacky here and have political implications
Oh I see, Thanks ^^
Some of our most delicious desserts are: [churros] [torrijas] (french toast), [arroz con leche] (rice pudding), [turrón] [pestiños] [sobaos] [crema catalana] [ensaimada] [tarta de Santiago] and [polvorones] among other things
I'm surprised there aren't italians pointing out TIRAMISU
Best dessert ever
[roscón de reyes] is delicious too, and pretty in season right now
Hmmm and [quesada]
I LOVE POLVORONES
litterally the best dessert (in my opinion)
>It's popularity overseas has been rising thru the roof and it's well worth it
Absolutely worth It
The churros with filling although they aren’t famous in Spain since people prefer the traditional ones they are really popular in Latin America
>The origins are discussed though, so not sure it is 100% French
I mean catalan creme IS  way older, but apparently slightly different
That the Spanish Inquisition were a bunch of fanatics burning people left and right
While they did torture and kill people and persecute suspected Jews, Muslims, heretics, etc
(the number of executed people varies between 3000 and 10000 between the 15th and 19th centuries) they were more akin to a secret police furthering the interests of the Spanish crown and church, with its members being well-educated in law (more than the secular courts, where judges many times needed help from jurists because they just didn't know the law or the jurisprudence)
Speaking of Spain as a country before the Nueva Planta Decrees in the early 18th century
Related to this, saying that Naples or the Low Countries were "Spanish". They weren't Spanish
Nor Castilian
They were owned and ruled by the same guy who owned and ruled the Spanish kingdoms
I'm watching "Hernán" series right now and I am actually getting all the details
It's quite close to the scripts of Bernal Díaz del Castillo
To be honest, I don't think it helps that, on the Internet, it's rather common for Portuguese and Spanish speaking people to reply each other in their own language
Probably people that don't speak either don't stop to read and don't notice the difference, I mean, why would they
[this]
Also, the memes
Even before meme culture as we know it today was born, people repeated non stop things like "If Hitler had learned from Napoleon and had not invaded in winter, we'd be speaking German now
", or like "The French built those fortifications along their border with Germany and then the Germans invaded through Belgium and the forts were useless
". There are a lot of common statements like those that have been repeated ad nauseam so much that people think they have to be true
That actually happened in WWII
Soviet regiments such as the 588th Night Bomber Regiment used biplanes that were so slow that German fighters had a lot of trouble engaging them
Inb4 expected Sabaton
Nope, there's no special Christmas booze in Spain
Some companies have really tried to push one with ad campaigns but none has really stuck
Im cities not, but it is quite common outside major cities
In rural areas it definitely is common, but in towns near cities is also pretty common
Ninja edit: at least in Catalonia
I'd say that it might not that common in some other regions
In rural areas, for sure
Never saw it in urban areas
I don't know but that'll be impossible where winter in tough
Here in Granada it is used in cortijos (country houses) or small villages
But it is not common at all in towns or cities
A empire is always for the growing of the original nation
Very few times is good for the conqueredhaving said that, some were more brutal than others
I didn't. I guess everyone knows Spain thanks to the empire
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Nara, Kobe, Sapporo, Hakodate, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Nagano, Sendai, Fukushima, Kawasaki, Yokohama, Kamakura, Kagoshima
Tokyo, Edo, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kyoto, Sapporo, Yokohama
And I don't remember more, I was going to say Hokkaido, but I think it's an island, right now I don't remember more but if I saw their names I could remember them, I blame anime
Okay, let's try
Not many, I think
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Nagoya
I think that's all
In this thread I've learned that Kobe, Sapporo, Kawasaki and Yokohama are towns
I knew the names but not that they were places
Kyoto, Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Naha
Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Sapporo, Kobe, Saitama, Kyoto, Nara, Okinawa, Kanagawa, Nagasaki
That's all that comes to my mind right now
WAIT Kawasaki is a real place
Now that you mention them Saitama and Fukuoka ring a bell, but I don't know exactly why
In Spain is [Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente ] with his TV program El hombre y la Tierra (The Man and the Earth), he was the person who more contributed to environmental awareness in Spain and teached the people to love the Iberian Wolf that was near to extinction
His death was a shock for a whole generation of children that grown watching he on TV
Rodríguez de la Fuente, the first to bring attention about the importance of preserving the ecosystem and the dangers of human industry in Spain
He is kind of a legend Rest In Peace
Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente the man who made the documentary of "El hombre y la tierra"
(the men and the earth)
Felix Rodriguez De La Fuente
He was kind of a hippy, very invested in nature, environmentalism and such
He sadly died in an helicopter crash while making a documentary in Alaska
Anyone, please watch El Hombre y la Tierra, i swear it is amazing
I think it's available for free at the RTVE website and app, but it's probably only in Spanish
Our society is heavily polarized so the answer to the question depends on your ideology
From the left, its Santiago Abascal, leader of VOX
From the right, its probably Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos
Far right and far left respectively, very polarizing
Goign to go ahead and answer for everyone: The current prime minister
Listen, I know that all politicians in Spain are a bunch of corrupts and thieves
Both the government and the opposition
What I meant with Iglesias house is that he, if he wants to be a workers representative, he should live like an average worker, not like 'the casta' which, remember, wanted to eliminate
Long story short, he is a hypocrite
I find there is a good cross-section of the population that just cannot stand [Pablo Iglesias] It is kinda bewildering how much flack he gets not just from the right (which is to be expected) but also from people who actually agree with Podemos' policies
Even his right hand had an argument with him and left to create his own party
I mean, the guy is a bit brass, and the smear campaign against him was moderately successful, but the reactions he provokes are just visceral
Yes
The left voters in my family can't stand him but they can still sometimes vote for Podemos because they agree with some of their policies
That being said, the one that they hate the most right now is Ayuso which makes zero sense because we aren't from Madrid
Ayuso is making herself an easy target
I wonder if it is deliberate, the same way Esperanza Aguirre made sure nobody took her seriously while she consolidated her power
We have "emparedados" (that's the name I know them with, but apparently it can mean other things as well)
It's a sandwich (usually ham and cheese but can be anything), battered in egg and fried
Tastes amazing, but it's basically a calorie bomb as it absorbs a lot of oil
They're not that common, anyway
We don't *fry* sandwiches by here, we spread butter on the loaves and cook it on a grill, pan or sandwich maker
You can find fried sandwiches (with egg and oil) in American-inspired restaurants though
"Grilled Cheese Sandwiches" is the North American term, I believe
I make that for my son's school lunch every day
Cheap vacations, drugs, alcohol and scientific researchers
We offer asylum to old Germans & British
When the UE finances Spain is not only financing the Spanish people but also your grampas healthcare when they decide to retire here
Our main exports are vehicles, pharmaceuticals, oil, food, clothing and ceramics, so probably those
Also a safe, nice place to go on vacations with sunny weather and lots of sightseeing
>The only EU Member to openly hate the French
Doesn't everyone do that
I feel like in Spain we're not shy about it, especially since everyone is taught about how Napoleon betrayed us and invaded us and we fought back
In fact this invasion more or less created Spanish national identity - before that (and still in many ways after that) we more of a combination of kingdoms and there wasn't a sense of patriotic unity
MVP for sure
I didn't realize how necessary and obvious such a measure should have been earlier until they implemented it
Dale mi bro
You also showed to the world that having a working central government is not really that necessary
Are you Spanish
That sounds a lot like Spain
You mean Spanish like located in Spain
Well, our brightest minds learn English, I'm not talking about the average Spaniard guy
I mean, you're not wrong, but in recent years many if not all children learn English from a very young age
We obviously don't finish our school years with a native-like English level, but it's more than acceptable (as someone else mentioned, though, our pronunciation tends to be terrible)
As for third languages, most common options are French or German, but, at least in my experience, schools don't give them much importance
They're just two hours a week for the 6 last years of high school at best
Many people, me included, stop taking those classes after 2 or 3 years
And unlike English, you don't find lots of media in those languages, so young people don't really find it useful in the short term
Spanish migration is a thing
Is it really that important though
I feel like it's the opposite of where the EU should be going
Every country's citizens pay for their own roads and every other country's citizens gets to use them for free, just like we all get to pay national rates for university across the EU, just like we get no roaming charges, and so on
If only Germany were to implement this toll it would be one-sided and if every country were to implement this it would be
unnecessary, imo
I get why the court ruled that way
In the coast people speak English because our main income comes from tourists
Our general level is poor, but new generations are more open minded to learn (and travel)
I mean, I kind of get it
If every EU country starts implementing policies like that, targeted at EU citizens from other countries, it kind of defeats the whole point of the economic union
If you have extra tolls and taxes it stops being so seamless to cross a border or move someplace else
I think having a general rule that all EU citizens should be treated the same by companies and the government is good
>Are you aware of a country like France
Where you have to pay about 10€ per 100 kilometres of motorway
Or Austria, where you have to buy a one week ticket in advance even if you want to use the motorways only for one day
And they were the ones who complained
Nope, was not aware
If it's only for foreigners and it applies to EU citizens it seems to me that it should be struck down as well based on precedent
> Universities are also not a good example because they are also financed by the tax payer but free to use for everyone
Just like the motorways and other roads
My point is that yes, you have to pay for foreigners to use your roads and unis
But in exchange you and everyone else gets to drive, study or work anywhere else in the EU under the same conditions
It seems to me like a fair deal
Ferdinand VII
After liberals successfully leadered the resistance against Napoleon and kicked out the French alongside the Brits and the Portuguese, he went back to Spain
He was called "the Desired" and was seen as a symbol of Spain's independence
But instead of keeping the new constitution enacted during the war, that established national sovereignty, a constitutional monarchy and universal suffrage, he abolished it and reinstated absolutism
He began a brutal campaign against the political opposition and when a liberal coup d'état forced him to accept a constitution, the Holy Alliance invaded the country and put him back in power
His authoritarianism and mismanagement of the country set us back for decades and wasn't even capable of solving the succession issue, which would cause three civil wars during the 19th century between the *isabelinos* (supporters of Isabella II's line) and the *carlistas* (supporters of her uncle Carlos' line)
History nowadays knows him as "the Felon king" and the worst ruler Spain has ever had
[Fernando VII of Spain] was the biggest reason the Spanish Empire fell when it did
When he came back to Spain he crushed liberal movements so hard that the same guerrilleros who had fought for him against the French became his worst enemies
**He scrapped the first constitution of this country** which was incredibly modern, with (if I remember correctly) universal male suffrage, and could have seriously helped address the valid protests from the American territories
At some point a liberal coup happened and **the guy literally called a [foreign army] into Spanish soil to put himself back into absolute power**. He prevented all attempts of modernizing and reforming the country, denied representation to the American viceroyalties, **which they had had during the war against the French**.
Hey I had the same answer
Fuck him, probably the worst king in our history
It's nice to see an answer at top in AskEurope
Usually the Spain answer is at the bottom of the thread ignored xD
People are stupid
They wanted this tyrant instead of all progress the French liberalism could have given the country
And the reason is purely blind nationalism
It has always been, is and always will be the cancer of societies
Yet we don't learn
Also, I think Franco and company should feature here
Literal traitors and all
Ah, the wonderful French liberalism that came at the point of a bayonette and was flabbergasted that Spaniards understood "being like the French" as "having the same rights as the French" and not as "being bossed by France".
Charles II wasn't a ruler
He was too ill to rule
He left his favourites in charge, and in fact they did a pretty decent job with what they had, helping to recover the economy from the 1640s crisis
But they couldn't do much in the different wars the Crown was still involved from previous reigns and because of the issue of succession
Ferdinand VII wasn't ill, he was just an asshole
A dumb one, too, because he didn't take any advantage at all of Spain's position as one of the allies that defeated Napoleon, alienated the American colonies that only wanted some provileges and not independence with his brutal repression in the Americas, put his friends in the cabinet instead of people who actually were interested in ruling the country and not their personal profit
I could go on and on
Actually her mother and regent queen, Mariana of Austria, was a good ruler
But Charles II is the Hapsburg meme so
Right
I don't know why I didn't think about those "people". I guess I was influenced by seeing people here talking about people from older times
>it's a miracle you still have one
It is still a pretty heated topic tbh
But yeah, we were at some point cursed by bad leaders and to this day cant shake that shit off
Oh well, I'll just keep drinking to a new republic
Of course it was far from ideal but still better than rotten tyrannical feudal ideas
The biggest political party in the country (that won the elections a few weeks ago) commited a fraud of about 700 million euros (the judge said they were guilty yesterday)
The Spanish Big Brother show recorded and streamed on national live TV the alleged rape/abuse of one of the contestants by a fellow contestant
Then, flash forward a couple days or weeks, they locked the girl in a room by herself, showed her the video on a TV and refused to let her out even when she was going through a mental breakdown and anxiety attack, all this while promising help was arriving at the room (a lie)
Everybody is outraged, and rightly so
I thought that int his type of places the usual was giving children in adoption
In Spain they used to sell the children to wealthy infertile couples during Francoism
My guess is that this were probably births that went wrong and the order hid it to avoid scandal regarding the conditions in which they had those young mothers
How did a democratic country like Ireland allow this to happen
In Spain it happened as the well (the stolen children of Francoism)
But it happened because the dictatorship created a context where church institutions had a lot of power and where corruption favouring the church and the wealthy was *very* widespread so everything was covered up
The language is called Serbo-Croatian (or Serbo-Croat-Bosnian or Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian-Montenegrin) by foreigner academics after all
It's a pluricentric language with four different standards, two different alphabets and many regional dialects, but it is linguistically the same language
Why don't Irish people speak on the bus
And why, if they have a need to communicate, whisper
The moment I questioned this I was hit by a universal truth:
##THE STEREOTYPE IS TRUE: WE, SPANISH PEOPLE, ARE _L O U D_  AS FUCK
I moved to the south of the country and I can't understand my own language
I continuously have to ask people to repeat what they said and it's really awkward
Yes, at least in Spain it is
Nowadays it's called defense
From 1834 to 1937 it was called Ministry of War and during the dictatorship we had 3 Ministries: Army, Navy and Air
Yes, its the "Ministerio de Defensa" wich means exactly what you think it means
I think pretty much all countries named it the "Ministry of War" in the 30's. I know ours did
Both are official languages in Finland, aren't they
a lot of countries called it ministry of war but in modern times that had change
In Spain, sports have usually been part of the Ministry of education
Mens sana in corpore sano and all that stuff
well if you have the equipment training a force is not that hard
the quality of it will be in doubt but countries like swizerland depends on that if i dont get it wrong
in your defense i can say that we have a ton of ministers
Im introvert, while spaniards "have to be" extroverts, easygoing, funny people
I don't like sleeping the ''siesta''. I have done it less than 30 times in my life, and all of them have been terrible
It usually gives me a sensation of disorientation and a headache similar to those you experience when you have hangover
Plus I think sleeping siesta is for lazy people
I don't like ham, seriously, I don't even want it
I have discovered the joys of shocks + flip flops
I hate bullfighting and I don't really like paella
I can't stand hot weather and suck at football
I don't like football at all
I don’t really like tortilla de patatas
And when I do eat it, I prefer it with onion
I dislike the weather
I don’t take siestas
I am horrible at mountain climbing, don't like classical music that much, don't hate Germans and I am not so fond of Kaiserschmarrn
Guiri
Was going to write this
Also, I don't like partying much and prefer a proper sit-down restaurant to tapas in a bar
Oh, I also hate bullfighting, but this is common
And now I'm not sure if I should be the writing this because my safety could be at risk, but
I've eated oranges consistently better than the Valencia ones (in Egypt) and seafood better (and much, much cheaper) than the Galician ones (in Cape Town, South Africa)
... Are you a northerner
Do Turks take religion very seriously
For example most of catholics I know identify as catholic but they dont put a step in the church if its not for something important like a wedding or a funeral
No, I'm from Mallorca
Hmmm, I have tried with air conditioners too, but the hangover-like feeling continues, I think it is because I get really disoriented when I wake up, my body thinks it is new day hahaha
I see, thanks for replying
"No te hagas el sueco" which means "don't play the Swede".
It makes reference to when someone pretends to not understand or play dumb to get away with something
I don't know where it comes from, Swedes seem like clever people to me
"Esto es un trabajo de chinos" = This is a work for the Chinese
It refers to work that is very difficut in the sense that it requires being very meticoulous, patient and perfectionist
I think it originally came from the Chinese porcelain manufactures
"Hacerse el sueco"
Kinda means "to behave like a Swedish", and is used for when you play ignorant in a topic you know about
I have no clue where this comes from
Vendrá por los turistas suecos que pueblan nuestras costas, que más de una vez no se enteran al hablarles en español
En realidad el sueco de esa expresión viene de "zueco" (soccus en latín), el zapato de madera medieval y antiguo
Solo que con el tiempo la etimología se confundió y la gente empezó a pensar que se referia a las personas suecas :P

It turns out it was just about Norwegians whoring around in my country but sure we make everything a completely mess
Does killing bulls for the show count
Is an amazing custom, really
So do you leave the heat on or what
Doesn't that consume your car battery
Wtf
And wht if something happens to him
That's like leaving your baby in the house
In Spain it depends on the generation
Old university teachers used to be addressed formally, but with younger ones the name is fine
In Spain the order is strictly kept
It would be really rude not to do so
IMO very much uncontroversial outside your borders too
Only with an opposite opinion
Is Malta progressive or conservative
What you just said makes me think conservative, but then I recently saw one of these homosexual acceptancy graphcs and Malta was really high
Plus the lower age for alcohol consumption and the stripclubs
Although I guess the latter is present for tourism more than anything, but just the fact that they allow it is significant
Anglos seem obsessed with pedophilia
We have them too
It is like this here too, more in the small cities and rural areas where life is more slow
But still there's much political correction and I'd say gypsies are treated much better here than in Eastern Euro countries
In addition, I don't think these negative comments are because of racism but bc of their behavior as a collective
Can confirm for Spain
I think that we only have documentals about the civil war
Take a look at "En construcción" by José Luis Guerín. 2001
*An author spent a year and a half filming what happened as a new apartment building was built in the El Chino neighborhood of Barcelona
En Construccion focuses less on the practicalities of raising a building than the impact the project has on those who live in the neighborhood, including a teenage couple squatting in a nearby building, an illegal alien looking for work for himself and his son, and a neighborhood girl who becomes infatuated with one of the construction workers
The death of a stray cat and the discovery of a mass grave during construction also points to the tragic losses that are sometimes part and parcel of progress

My pleasure
~~Definitely not true
Just for info:
[Memoria de España] is a fairly decent series and a very famous one, from the big bang to Gonzalez/Aznar
As far as a documentary produced by state's TV can go, it's among the best you can find
I don't know if it's available in English though
Not really, you can find a lot of documents in the [archivo histórico del nodo]  be it historic events, sports, everyday life and of course war and whatnot
Also there are a lot of documentaries on youtube, I guess if someone is interested enough it would be easy for them to find
but well here you have a big bunch but i think that all are in spanish so sorry
Histocast has also a great podcast but again only in spanish
[HistoCast]
(Also a lot of history of other matters but they have a lot abaut Spain)
the only ones i know (that arent documentaries are more historic shows) are pretty specific such as Isabel or Carlos depicting the lives of Isabel I the Catholic queen and Carlos with Charles the I of Spain and V of Germany
It was a joke
Sorry, not very fresh after work :/
Hahaha no problem, it's good that you added a link to something interesting, my joke doesn't add that much to the conversation
Eating grapes on new years eve, one grape for every time the bell tolls at 00:00 (so 12 grapes in total, pretty quickly)

One of out traditional games is: *let's both take an ax and see who is the one that cuts this log in half first*
Sevillanas WHEN accompanied with clapping and chanting with terrible voices and the most uneducated Spanish accent possible
I wrote an essay about that in French class
It's fucking crazy mate
We burn and bury the doll of a giant sardine at the end of carnival here
Now I wanna do that
Spain seconds this
Molt bona
We watch Grease, idk why
Yeah, Home Alone is also aired in Spain around Xmas
Yas, we do
Thanks
Seems really fun
Vice is
An interesting source
most historical figures have somehting controversial about them, specially if you look at them from a modern perspective
The catholic monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, were extremely important to Spain's history (since they fucking founded the country by marrying) but they were both warmongers and catholic fanatics
The expelled the jews and muslims the moment they gained control over the peninsula
but they were nontheless awesome
its purely subjective, most people, including politicians or in some cases dictators, only want "the best", and arent inherently evil
While conquistadores usually get (unjustly IMO) the bad rap, Christopher Columbus was a real asshole that even got his bones in jail for mistreatment of the natives
You consider "good" as the default
Hey that's kink shaming
I'm surprised that one of the main fascist leaders has a good fame
The french asked us to go through Spain to invade Portugal, we agreed and once they had all their army here they invaded us
Never trust the french
In their defense, I’d rather have Napoleon than Fernando VII and Carlos IV
I'd rather have a drunk and blind monkey than those two guys
Don't worry they helped us keep him too
"WE ARE SAVING THE KING, PLEASE DO NOT RESIST"

The black colour is sick, and it has a symbol which is always a plus in my book

Thanks for pointing it out
One could say Benidorm: it evolved from a small fishermen village to [this]  If you ask me, this artificial jungle of steel is not what I call evolution, but whatever
Shenzhen de Hacendado
I think a lot of people are really sad about this evolution in a lot of cities
Others appreciate how much money tourism provides, but I believe a vast majority of people think this is too much
Personally, I hate this (I even edited the comment to avoid being too harsh)
In a lot of cities, the natural landscape [has been slaughtered]  and beautiful cities with culture and history have been turned into decadent theme parks, just like Benidorm
The photo is from El Algarrobico, in the coast of Almería. It's one of the most beautiful landscapes and they just destroyed the coastline to put that thing there
To me, this is utterly disgusting

This remains me, the last weekend me and my bf's family were doing a barbecue in theirs garden and we start the fire as usual
Suddenly a little (not so little) lizzard ran from the brigs of the barbecue
It seems this was his home and we fire it
To be fair, Inditex and the sort don't help with low prices compared to other countries
And I don't trust used electronics as well
Hehehe
I don´t understand how in Germany small towns with less than a 100 people have fiber glass internet with high speed (like my cousin) but then the big cities are not able to get decent internet at cheap prices
I would say Germans value to pay instantly, without debts and like to know their exact economic balance
With cash it is very easy to see, with card, specially if Credit Card, it is much less obvious to follow
At least that´s the reason my dad always used cash (born and living in Bavaria), the typical german in his 50s. But now he also pays mostly with card because convience and discount on pays, so even Germany is changing
Nobody in Spain writes it without the stroke as far as I know
Both are perfectly acceptable and widely used
I usually put a line in the middle, out of habit, but I don't care much about it
Well It depends, when writting without, when describing the whole numbers, with
I actually write it like that
I do, at least in lower case
The upper case has to have it, tho, if not poor Zorro has been teaching us wrong
Wait, whaaaaat
q doesn't have a stroke everywere
I've never ever would have thought of it
Everyone i know writes the q with the line here
Looool that is also done, and also, virtually nobody writes a Q without a stroke, and to add more, also 7 is written with a stroke
Tbh I have no idea, we are just taught to write it that way
Somewhat, most of the cases with second names are like compound/compoded names, like José María, María José, Juan Antonio, José Antonio, Juan José, and maybe others
They are said fully, not one of them, and sometimes if know them and are somewhat close to them, you pronounce a abbreviated version of the two names: Juanan = Juan Antonio, Josema = José María, JJ or Juanjo = Juan José.
We have 2 family/last names so we don't need more names
Name + Father's first lastname + Mother's first lastname
It's very usual, mostly in older people
There was a time in Spain where all girls had to have 'María' and boys 'José' as their first name for religious reasons
So tons of María 2ndName and José 2ndName here
Somewhat common
I'd say not having middle names is more common, specially with younger people, but they are still not rare
But never forget
Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos xD
And taking into account that in Spain there are two surnames, so there are people with 2 names (or more) and 2 surnames
Sometimes you still to the full name, sometimes you use one or the other, usually the first one, but not always
For example people called *Francisco Javier* usually go by *Javier* rather than *Francisco*. And as you said hypocorisms as very common as well, some people limit their use to their relatives and closer friends but go by their full names in other environments
No, no, no, it's Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos *de Marichalar y Borbón.*
Yeah
Also compound surnames are not uncommon either
So a name like María Dolores González Cabeza de Vaca is perfectly fine
Or 'María José', 'María Jesús'... for the same reason
But what happens with Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos de Marichalar y Borbón? It's he better than everyone because belongs to the royal family
But I agree that more than 2 names are too many
No idea
A lot of people from non latin countries change their last names when they get married
We are the different ones xD
I only learned about that fact fairly recently and I still can't get over it
That's a thing in Spain too
When I found out most people do the opposite in other countries I was really weirded out
I can't be barefoot at home
"So weird to think about that here, even though we don't even have lyrics
Everyonr stands up and goes "chunda chunda"
I would not say it is so odd in many places of Europe
In Spain is common to smile or talk to strangers for example
I've noticed that watching a movie in the US
Like, why
Do you think the crew is here or what
But id no one tips, no waitress is going to work and the business goes default or start paying a living wage
That's not rude, because that question has lots its meaning and in that context it's a formality to say hello in a friendly manner
It's like when you say goodmorning even when the morning is shit
Sure, they just aren't as common for us because we don't use the car that often
Every customary unit is defined metrically, so at least they have that going
It's a cultural thing
We use slippers
If I get at *my* home I'm going to get changed to more comfortable wear, including shoes (slippers)
Although if you're heading out soon you're just going to keep them on
But if you go to someone's house, we never take them off
All houses and main buildings entrances have mats
If it gets dirty you just get a mop and clean it
I actually find someone else's smelly and sweaty feet more disgusting than getting the floor a bit dirty from their shoes
I'll just clean afterwards
The Science Museum in Granada, Spain is pretty cool: [
I think the [City of Arts and Science of Valencia] is the perfect example
i could see myself in that building
I'm not against integration, the question should be "Which conditions need to be met to form a real European Union"
It would be such a dream to be able to get on a train from any major city, and barring stopovers, be able to get outside of the peninsula on high speed
Technically yes, you can get on an Ave to Barcelona and change trains to get to the outside, ~~but the rest of Spain might not have that access much longer~~. I mean, look at Irun,  it’s our connection to the North Atlantic railway corridor
with only regular-speed access to the rest of Spain
It’s embarrassing
>I'd switch from national lists to european parties voted by everyone
The European Parliament is voted differently from one country to another, as long as it's proportional representation
The lack of a unique system is nonsensical
>single currency
Working on it
There's one less outlier
I agree on everything tbh
I want transparency
Like, complete one
What would this do for self-government *within* EU countries, though
There are already federal countries, united kingdoms, and other legal figures for self-governing regions
My own country has a very complex balance of national and regional power, one that is currently causing quite a lot of conflict, and let's just say it's *not* the first time
So I wonder, how would an even bigger state power, along with the usual national power, balance with self-governance
National governments already do have balances on taxing, powers and policy, and making a pan-European framework that would fit the constitutional requirements of all pseudofederal entities in the union seems like a bit of a nightmare, if not impossible
On top of that, would it be allowed for countries to leave, as it is now
Because that is a pretty stark difference between examples of federal macro-countries in other continents, and it would perhaps change the willingness of all countries to go through with it
I think I'd like it to happen, as long as it does not become an imperialist force and actually veers more towards a social state (but not just in name, like mine is defined to be in the very first article of its Constitution)
I'm thinking about what it took to constitute the EEC in the first place
and I'm hoping we don't have to have a 30's and 40's repeat
Thousands of miles away
Are you a french colony
Do you want another “Berlin Airport”? Because that’s how you get another Berlin Airport situation
If they were to start replacing the tracks today, at this very moment, my grandchildren will probably be the ones to see them complete the operation
Am I being a little skeptical
Yes quite a bit, but it isn’t exactly unjustified
I cried green tears of envy a while back when a dutch person mentioned that their country could do roadworks through the night and it be ready by the morning, while there’s a 500m elevated highway overpass that I take daily that has been out of commission since August
Our would be a white collar princess-thief and the badie of the tale
Isabel II
well we dont have good options in history
the more famoues was Isabel the I and i dont see a disney cartoon about conquering the muslims and expelling jews while marryng your cousin
With ww2 related events
Not deep though
Just: soviet attack, soviets die, pyrrhic victory, Germany attacks, Finland joins, soviets win
we arent taught anything about it at school but i've learnt from a really good book explaining the campaign in detail by Richard W Condom
It wasn't the Rosenbergs who passed US nuclear secrets to the Soviets, it was the cockroaches in the laboratories
I mean, does it count the whole city of Rome if you are italian
You do have impressive 20th and 21st century architecture

Catalonia
It's kinda fucked up to show it at kid hours
Well, to be honest that's not a "small controversy".
So who do they want to cut off
Some guys declared independence, it went against the constitution they jured, so they became jailed, and their followers went crazy
Wait, really
The Turkish refugee
It's always the yanks saying that bullshit lol
I take a siesta regularly, I really need them
i like to pretend i dont speak english and use the spanish question marks
I went to Cornwall and started speaking with the natives just like a proper Spaniard
Close contact, a big smile, some sort of small talk and a slightly elevated volume just to make sure they understand me
For several years, while I lived close to my parents, I went there almost every Sunday to have paella
Take a siesta when I can (weekend or holidays)
Usually go to bed at 1-2am
Woke up at 12pm watched a soccer game, came back home, ate paella, slept for half an hour, went to watch the bulls, had some beers with my friends and saw a flamenco performance
Most stereotypical day of my life as a Spaniard in Feria de Sevilla
Well, I eat lunch at 15:00-16:00 everyday and dinner at 22:00-23:00
Oh my god, that's so funny
You'd have a lot of trouble in some cities of my country where you have to wave at the driver so they'll know that they have to stop
If it had been in Mallorca it would be peak tourist German
"by accident"
Same here
Other Spanish people hate walking around the city with me because I hate crossing when cars are coming my way
In Spain we allow double citizenship treaties with countries with "strong links to Spain" specially Iberoamerican countries
I'm happy with it because it allows to get Spanish citizenship without losing your previous one, and viceversa, which makes everything easier in terms of bureaucracy
It's true but there's a loophole
I have friends who got the British citizenship and you can always get your nationality back if you ask for it  in the next 3 years after denouncing your Spanish citizenship and then keep both
It's quite common, actually
[source]
I think you can actually have any double nationality as long as you don't stop making use of the Spanish one, and male an official declaration that you want to keep it
As a double Filipino and Spanish citizen (e: by birth), [I think they’re neat]
Cope and seethe citizenshiplet
According to art
24 Civil Code, if a Spanish citizen resides abroad and acquires another citizenship, he will lose Spanish citizenship in a three years term unless he declares his will to keep it
This won't happen if said citizenship is an Iberoamerican country, Portugal, Andorra, Guinea, or the Philippines, or if there's a double citizenship treaty
If you had Spanish citizenship and you lose it you won't have to acquire it again
You can recover it by legally residing in Spain and declaring your will to recover it according to art 26 Civil Code
All in all, these declarations are more bureaucracy but there would be no serious issue
Wait, then double citizens vote twice
> as opposed to places with a more "civic" tradition (eg
UK, France)
Don't most of those countries have a colonial past
Can it be related to it
It's certainly the case of Spain
Oddly specific, here in Spain we had a massive wave in the late 80's and 90's, it was unknown and it spread because we had a huge (very huge) heroin epidemic that came with the decay of heavy industry and manufacturing, so people who weren't conscious of it shared needles all the time and many contracted the virus that way
Also worth mentioning unprotected sex in the first years of sexual revolution (very catholic country freshly out of a fascist dictatorship so sex education was non existent at the time) although to my understanding it wasn't as significant as the drugs issue regarding AIDS
It spread a lot in Spain during the 80's, when there was a drug epidemic and people would share syringes, but i dont know much more on the subject
It was not seen as a gay disease but as something related to drug use, blood transfusions and sex in general
French sounds very sophisticated, a little too much I'd say, almost superb
Italian for me takes the cake, it has a unique and beautiful sonority, it feels romantic but in a lighthearted way
Italian
But all languages can be very beautiful depending on the person speaking them
French on a woman is everything I wish for
I have a thing for Yorkshire accents too
Thanks for the compliment, random frenchman
French, Galician and Catalan
Why do you like German
I think it's not fair to compare the sound of your own language, to you it just sounds normal
Thank you, very well explained
I don't really mind the jokes if they are well though or original, things like the French are cowards, the evil Russians, etc
are starting to get (or already are) annoying
PS: If somebody could explain to me why people find so great the "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" quote I would be grateful
I hate all those jokes about how irrelevant is that European country whose name I don't remember or care
I dislike the nazi jokes or insults
Most germans alive right now have nothing to do with nazis (most of them weren't even born in 1945) so I don't see the point
I don't like seeing Italy and Portugal getting insults either
Don’t make jokes about communism unless you’re from a former communist country yourself
It’s some very rough history
On the Spanish Inquisition thing, just own it dude
I recently went on a trip to a few cities in Europe with a bunch of friends, we all live in Spain although some were not Spanish
Pretty big group, 7 of us
Greek dude said “no one expects the Spanish Inquisition” as we walked into our first hostal and it stuck from there lmao
We said that when we would go into a train, new hostal or whatever
Difficult to erase as many countries feed their nationalist rhetoric with it
Oh no
OH NO
AW LAWD, THEY COMING
TAKE SHELTER
Enano, that means to dwarf
but I'm taller than my father
Well, my parents never really gave me a nickname but I used to spend a lot of time with my  grandparents since my parents worked a lot (mom had 3 jobs and dad worked 11h/day)
One of my grandmas would call me 'sorgiña' which means 'witch' in basque because witches are part of our culture and I really enjoyed their tales as a kid
My other grandma called me 'mi gitana' which would translate from spanish to 'my gypsi', no idea why tho
They call me "Uly" or "Xavi", which is the diminutive of my two names, the first one being "Ulysses" and the second one "Xavier".
Sorgintxo that means little witch in Basque
I always loved it
Patata: it means potato, because my face was very round
Princesa descalcita: it means little barefoot princess, because I hated wearing shoes
Rata verde de alcantarilla: it means green sewer rat, I have no idea where that one comes from, but I hated it because I wanted to be a red sewer rat, not a green one
My brother was the red one and we used to argue about it
Mom used yo call me "Enano" which is midget or dwarf in spanish
Not very appropriate by today's standards
My name is Alejandro, so they used to call me (and still do) Jandrito
My dad also used to call me enano/nano because I am the younger son
I’ve always been called by my name
When I behaved bad some other names were use as: Cabezon, capullo or ¿quieres que te de con la chancla
I called my brother that
Well, in Basque, I used to call him "txiki" now he's almost 40 cm taller than me
Same as you, they call me enano because of I am the last one but I am also the tallest
Well, enano is dwarf, yeah, but in this context it means little/young one
Oh my God
My father also called me that
In my case it was "sorgintxo" but same thing
Spaniard here
Not a thing in Spain and I am very confused on how this works lol
Maybe in southmerican Spanish is a thing
My retired uncle is still "the kid/boy". Like, I only realised that was not his actual name when I was a teenager
Even his friends call him the kid
I am "the kid/girl" (I am 34), a nickname I share with a 60 year old aunt
The family have to guess by context which of us someone is talking about
No, he is like 1,80m and I'm 1,85m
Oh, sorry, I don't know where my flare went to haha
I'm from València, Spain
Hahaha, no
It uses the less common ways to speak, you are going to be right but you are also going to sound a little strange
Only of you want to learn Spanish with Latinamerican accent
With Spanish, I do the talking in the listening exercises so that my bf gets used to an accent from Spain
It's Latin American in Duolingo and there is no option for European Spanish :(
Probably
My bf is learning with Duolingo and I have to be constantly explaining that "we don't use that word", ot "that is not the standard phrase in Spain", or "this word sounds archaic", etc
That said, it has helped him with sentence structure, some vocabulary (this is one of the trickiest parts because it can be quite different in Latin America) and verb conjugation
I just need to keep an eye on it and explain the differences when they come up
Edit: forgot to say that I do the talking in the listening exercises for my bf so that he gets used to an accent from Spain
Hahaha, yeah, this is why my bf only uses Duolingo if I am there to keep an eye on what they are teaching him
Yeah, they mix things, but they don't tell you
So you might end up building a sentence the Spanish way, but using Mexican vocabulary, or saying it in a Mexican accent, for example
Here it's the same, but with domestic violence
Cigarette ads are still legal in Germany
How's the republican movement in the Netherlands
I'd say Spain has the strongest among all Europe (around 30-40%)
Oh God you're [not kidding] Very suprising to see, in Spain it tends to be 4-5€ per pack
I am glad I don't smoke and I kinda think it's a good thing that it's expensive, but I feel for poor fellas who somoke
That's not true at all
>Smoking was associated with a greater mean annual healthcare cost of €1600 per living individual during follow-up
However, due to a shorter lifespan of 8
6 years, smokers’ mean total healthcare costs during the entire study period were actually €4700 lower than for non-smokers
For the same reason, each smoker missed 7
3 years (€126 850) of pension
Overall, smokers’ average net contribution to the public finance balance was €133 800 greater per individual compared with non-smokers
It's kind to call it cosmetic
there's tons of feeling on there
It's still genital mutilation, albeit a bit less horrific than the female version
But it's not a log as in shit, it's a log as in a tree
They beat the everloving shit out of it and then ask for presents, like a very violent assault with robbery against a plant
And the Portuguese city of Braga is the Spanish word for panties
At least that is what I remember a friend from Barcelona told me they did as kids
Honest question, why does Scandinavia include Denmark
If by Scandinavia we mean the peninsula
Well, I'm sorry but Scania has been Swedish for a couple of centuries already
I once got Pepsi instead of Coke with the pizza I ordered
I tried to drink it but couldn't even drink half of it
I also don't like beer, taste is a pretty personal thing
Well, Iberian languages include Portuguese and Castillian and nobody would say that Argentina and Brazil are Iberian nations
Okay, but if we're going by cultural definitions why not include Finland
Is Finnish culture that different from Swedish, for example
I've never been to Finland but it doesn't look like that to me
That's my point
If we're going by geography, Scandinavia should include only Norway and Sweden
If we're goinf by culture, it should include Finland and Iceland as well, shouldn't it
Including Denmark but not the other two feel arbitraty to me
Most often than not (99% of the times), I know what gender a word is
Sometimes, it can be hard for different reasons
Some examples of situations one may struggle with, that I can think of right now, are:
* __Libido__: it's feminine
When I learned the word, I remember thinking it was "el libido" because it ends on an "o". It's not, it's "la libido". Now saying it in masculine just sounds weird
* __Words that, due to cacophony, use a different article__: like the word for water, *agua*, it's feminine, but we say "el agua", not "la agua"; or the word for fairy, *hada*, "el hada". In these cases the confusion isn't on what article you use, but the gender
So for instance, the confusion could come with the gender of the adjective: "el hada bonita", "el agua cristalina"... See
The article is masculine, but the adjective feminine
Edit: added the explanation *because it ends on an "o"*
In spanish if a word ends in A it's usually feminine, but there are exceptions like el mapa, when ypu encounter these exceptions all you can do is memororize them
In Spain we use the feminine "La nutella" but we dont have neutral gender
>Most often than not (99% of the times), I know what gender a word is
However a fun thing happens when A word is new
we effectively guess as a society it's gender
For example, covid, which is technically feminine, has been considered masculine by the population
What it's important to remember is that it's guesswork
You can be very good at it, but there's no 100% effective way to guess
As a native, I guess it's about intuition
We just know in most situations
It's more about exposing your brain to all of those words through reading and listening more than it is about memorizing
Because as a native you obviously get that kind of exposure to the language, it becomes intuitive to know the gender of a word, even if you've never seen that word before
I didn't know the rules, but I looked it up and it may not be as arbitrary as you think:
* If a word ends in -aje or -ambre; it's usually masculine
Most important exception: el hambre (masculine article due to cacophony, but the word is feminine)
* if a word ends in -ie, -nte, and -umbre; it's usually feminine
Notable exceptions: diente and puente
Your examples, sadly, wouldn't be part of any of the rules
So with those, yeap, it's pretty much about exposure and adquiring that intuiton-based knowledge that makes you don't need to think about it
Pretty much what you said
With words that are already established and have a dictionary entry, we guessed, and usually we are correct
In the weird instances we're not, we realize our mistake and move on
But with new words, as you said, it's just everyone guessing
We don't know which is correct, and you can argue for one or the other gender, but as long as a word isn't well established, we are all just guessing
Personally, with covid I used to refer to it as masculine
I didn't thought of what it meant in English
Then, people started saying it was feminine because it meant "enfermedad por coronavirus", so I changed it to feminine, as feminine made much more sense
At first it was weird saying it with the feminine article, but then it became normal and now I can't say "el covid". after the switch it just sounds so wrong xd
its not that
If everithing is feminine we use the feminine but in every other case we use masculine
the neutral gender is totally a diferent thing that we get rid when we stoped using Latin
That's for clearly mixed, not for unclear
If it helps, Mädchen is technically a diminutive, and diminutives are neuter
> Personally, with covid I used to refer to it as masculine
I didn't thought of what it meant in English
Then, people started saying it was feminine because it meant "enfermedad por coronavirus", so I changed it to feminine, as feminine made much more sense
At first it was weird saying it with the feminine article, but then it became normal and now I can't say "el covid". after the switch it just sounds so wrong xd
And for others (hi
), we learned it early on as “covid = corona +virus”, and virus is masculine, so obviously covid is masculine too
I’m sure that my brain will eventually accept it as feminine, but until then…
the french master in uniting Germany
There are quite a few in Spain but it doesn't sound as common as in Germany
At least they are pretty and with a good end
I think that they are better than the American thriller-murder films that put Antena 3 or the catastrophic low quality films of Cuatro and La Sexta xD
Apart from Das Boot and Die Welle, every single German film I have seen has been absolute trash
Sunday evening Antena3 movies have become their own genre
And it's not good
Good old Lavalantula
It's always about a woman whose husband/boyfriend is evil or about little girls being kidnapped
Lazy Town
I watched that so much as a child, I didn’t even like or enjoy it, jut it just seemed to always be on TV
I still need to watch that masterpiece
That show was epic
Yes, it’s always a 40-50 year-old German woman having a mid-life crisis and finding love and adventure in the cheesiest way
I secretly love them
There is one where she goes to some place in Africa and it’s such a white savior movie that it would have been banned in the USA
I also like to change it to German without subtitles and see how much I can understand (I’m always trying to learn) or make wild stories in my head about what is really going on
They are the best, 14/10
Bull fighting
It's inhumane and most people in Spain are against it
Ammusing: everyone can play the guitar and we shout OLÉ at random intervals
¡OLÉ!
That we all like flamenco and bullfighting
I thought about right-wing conservatives, but oh well
The most common stereotype is that they are gypsies, but that doesn't make any sense, as they only account for around 3% of the population, while in Bulgaria and North Macedonia they account for 10%
And Italy with southern Italians
What is with the people from the southern part of any given country
There are plenty, and in many provinces it is already illegal
In Granada they turned the bull ring into a bunch of night clubs
And because Americans know literally nothing about European history before the world wars and keep repiting the same jokes about the 20th century like if it was all there ever happened
Then, because of the prevalence of those jokes in American media, people all over the world have started repeating them
There are many Spaniards that make that joke and I'm always pissed even if I'm not French
Do they even know how many wars we lost against them
> in that a single word can mean 17 different things based on the context you use it in
That happens in every langauge tho
Over 20°C. Though I might as well wear a jacket if it's under 25°C. Over 25°C a t-shirt becomes the go to
It depends on activity and other conditions (higher if raining, very humid, windy, etc), but as a very rough estimate I would say 10 to 15 ºC.
25 C for me, and i would be wearing a jacket or similar above the shirt cus the mornings in madrid are very cold at least for me, but i have bad circulation and my hands and feet are always cold even in the summer so maybe thats why i can take hot temperatures without melting and become an ice cream just by i slightly colder morning, because im a reptilian with the coldest blood
If sunny and not windy, even 10ºC is enough
If not sunny and windy, at least 20ºC, or maybe more
Yeah about that
at 40°C do you melt
Absolutely
I'm from Galicia and in my city the average temperature during summer is about 15º to 25ªC... If it gets to 30º or above I feel like I'm in hell, honestly (unless there's some nice breeze to compensate it)
I'm not exaggerating when I say that when I went to Ontario during summer I felt like I was melting
Yeah, IN CANADA, I wasn't freezing, I was melting xd
The temperatures weren't even than high (usually topped at 30ºC on the hottest days), but man, they got no wind
It was absolutely terrible
>Yeah, IN CANADA, I wasn't freezing, I was melting xd
Well, when I was in Alaska I once went out with a t-shirt
Fairbanks 32°C. It gets crazy hot up there
>Guess it's all scales and what we're used to but I would be pretty uncomfortable
High humidity really messes up with the way our body cools, so it's always going to feel hotter
However many people say they can't breathe in Madrid
our climate is too dry for them
So what we're used to plays a very important role ;)
Omg, this is so true and made me remember one of my worst experecines regarding heat EVER
We were on a road trip by bus, coming from Montreal back to Ontario
It was about 8 hours
Our bus had AC, so not so terrible
Until the bus stopped working
It started beeping, and the AC ceased to function
Then the bus slowed down, until it was going so slow that the driver had to stop on the side of the highway
Somehow they managed to make it work again, after a lot of stalling,  and we got alive to the nearest resting place (you know those restaurants in the middle of the road and stuff)
Well, we had to change buses
The one they brought had the seatings lined with a very warm, winter-like fabric
And no AC
Needless to say we all experience 5 of the worst hours of our lives
A girl even had a heat stroke and an ambulance had to bring her back home
People barely talked cause it felt like such a waste of energy and oxygen
Overall: a terrible experience
1/10, would not recommend
At least I'm glad I was in good company in the bus (friends and a girl I was dating), cause if it was just me and some strangers I don't know how much worse it could have been
You know, when you feel like you want to die I imagine it's better to be surrounded by your loved ones and stuff lol
Hell yeah, cabriolets are so nice during summer
We no longer have a dictator buried with honors in a monument
Hell yeah
Instead of spanish, i'll mention galician heroes (because i can)
Breogán: celtic hero that probably didn't exist, basically our Arthur or Cu Chulainn
María Pita: a woman who fought against the british during the XVI century
Rosalía de Castro: the poet who almost singlehandedly resurrected galician literature
Special mention: Franco, a huge piece of shit but i guess some people see him as a hero
May he rest in piss
The Catholic Kings (Fernando and Isabela) United the two biggest kingdoms of the peninsula into one and eliminated the last Muslim stronghold in Granada
They also supported Cristóbal Colon who ended up "discovering" America
Hernan Cortes:  he is the first name pops on people's minds when they think about the Conquistadores
Half warrior half explorer, he obliterated the Aztecs civilisation with only a handful of soldiers
Clearly not a national hero but probably person of interest
The chairmaker: he represents the valencian people who rose up on rebellion against Napoleon
A man who left his job building chairs and joined the resistance
Jaume I: as a kid he was sent to the South of France as politics were quite bad in Aragon
He was trained by the templar knights and took control of his kingdom from the plotting vassals
He launched a series of campaigns against the Muslims that culminated with the fall of València
He is well known for his biography and for launching Aragon into the list of European great powers
Iniesta
This is probably very political to say, but
Francisco Franco
Prior to World War II Spanish government was in the middle of turning to communism as from the USSR, so Italy and Hitler helped Franco conquer Spain from the communist government
Then Franco kept good relations with Hitler so they wouldn’t conquer Portugal, and also stayed good with him in World War II so they wouldn’t conquer Spain itself as well
If it wasn’t for Franco, Spain would’ve been conquered by Hitler and Portugal as well
and people here are not Aryan so I do not know what would’ve happened
Also, spain was not neutral in World War II, they helped a lot on the eastern front against Russia (that’s it)
My Great grandfather himself was rammed off a cliff on his bike by a Soviet Truck after coming back from work for thinking he was with Franco
María Pita fought against the English during the attack of Drake's Armada following the defeat of the Spanish Armada
You're mixing her with Manuela Malasaña, a girl from Madrid who died fighting alongside his father against the French in the 2 May uprising that began the Peninsular War
She's also a national heroe and her neighbourhood is now named after her (Malasaña)
What about the Moroccans that fought for Spain
History is a slut
Fuck
Actually i mixed her up with Agustina of Aragón.
Yes, but he was a spanish nationalist and suppressed our language
Exactly, some people have Hitler as their hero
That's what i meant
When
If you mean the ones who fought under Franco no
They are not heroes
Ohh my neighbor hello
About the first part I think you may be mistaken, Franco wanted to protect Portugal from Hitler as Franco did not at all agree with what Hitler was doing
but if he declares so publicly Hitler would know and try to conquer Spain, which was suffering and couldn’t do much as they just started recovering from the civil war
As for the non aggression pact, that’s true
But Franco’s Main reasoning for protecting Portugal was because:
-Ports everywhere leads Hitler to have greater naval power
-and surrounding Spain
They could so easily just take spain as well
Also a thing to note was how Franco got Hitler to not talk to Franco
Franco, being Hitler’s Allie was forced to help Hitler, so Franco arrived late to one of the meetings for plans and didn’t say anything for hours while Hitler ranted, then just said something like “okay, I’m going to help you against russia” then sent one division and from what I’ve heard relayed most of that information for Hitler’s plans to Churchill - apparently
As for the Carnation revolution that’s true, but Franco was too old by then so eh, not like he could’ve done anything about it anyways
Ajaja you may need to reform your library for a bit
He was a general in Morocco, fighting against some moors and recruiting others
I don't know if that counts
What
Why
I'm not sure what you already know
But clearly to me you are pointed at what you learned in papers that were assigned to you to know
To say that they weren't heroes
It a shame
That why I don't know where to start
In fact you stated that they were UNDER Franco which is very true
They were betrayed just like your granddads
What are you talking about
The moors who fought for Franco are criminals, traitors and fascists
Please, explain me why are they heroes
Who the fuck at they to you
The moors
do you refer to converted Spanish or the Berbers
You're fucked up
All the muslim minorities that fought under Franco, i was taught that they were moors
Sorry if my wording was offensive or not exact
Feel free to correct me
The Moors Los moriscos son españoles que se convirtieron al islam y fueron kicked de España a l norte de Marruecos
Hasta hoy siguen ahí. Los nativos del norte que son berbers,no tienen nada que ver con los árabes
Franco betrayer them all
Moriscos and moor are different
I meant "moros",which is a (i think) catch-all term for all muslim ethnics
Sorry if my wording was unfortunate,i didn't mean the moriscos
That the term .but its wrong
Moro is a racist term after the Moroccans in whole whether Muslims or not
My grandfather fought the Spanish civil war, on both sides
He was doing the military service in Madrid when the war started, so he fought in the battle of Madrid on the Republic side
Then on a leave he went to his village to see his parents and found they have been killed by communists for the crime of owning a few acres of land to the anthem of "the land for those that work it
" (ignoring the fact that this land have always been worked by him and his parents and sisters)
So instead of returning to Madrid, he went directly south and joined the nationals
With them he fought the Battle of the Ebro
After the war, the nationals found his records on the republican army and tagged him suspect and put him on a concentration camp
There he could see every night some inmates would be woken up to a "paseillo" ("little walk") to get shot
An officer that fought with him got him out of the camp, but he got a chronic pneumomia that made the rest of his life pretty miserable
He died in the 80s at the age of 64 years and never spoke of the war, what we know is from my grandmother and other sources
My uncle was a police chief for a medium sized town around Madrid during the dictadure
He gave explicit orders to his men to pursue only real criminals and not people for political stuff
For a time I thought it was an ass-saving lie until on some elections in the 90s (he was running for town major for the PP, moderate right wing, which he won) I saw a very old man, a delegate of the Communist Party give him a hug and he told me that my uncle saved his life during the dictadure
I was born in South Africa
My maternal grandfather was part of the military contingent that bombarded the [Rand Rebellion ] He was following orders but never forgave himself
My grandma's brother was mistakenly arrested by Civil Guards at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War (prior to it he had been an apolitical farmer who participated in an Agrarist association) and was sent to San Simón island, a Galician island that hosted an old hospital which was reconverted into a prisoner camp by the Nationals
There he spent two years before being trasladed to another prison in the Basque Country and spent another year before the Francoists realized their error and set him free
He then fled to France, took a boat to Venezuela and sweared to God that he wouldn't return until the dictatorship's end
The term you’re after is conscripted
> The imperial war museum have the original copy of a porn he wrote whilst in the tenches of the Somme
Porn
Nice
I was a South African conscript and sent to Angola during the bush war
I'm 20 and my grandpa fought in the Spanish Civil War, which happened just before WW2
True :)
None
BUT, actually
The last emperor of the eastern roman empire actually left on his will the title of emperor to the crown of Spain
So I guess there's something lawful there hahahaha
Don't quote me on this, but yes constantine (the XIth
) Or like his son or grsndson or something like that
I think he sold it
It's one of those cool old european things hahaha
The king of spain is also the king of jerusalem
Dunb stuff like that are my fav things about europe haha
Actually, we did in the Americas the same as the Romans did in Hispania: culture substitution
Legally speaking, it is binded to the kingdom of spain
Jus like the crown of jerusalem (spanish too)
I mean it makes no sense but legally speaking
hahaha
Nope, it was given by a pope (inocent III ?) To the king of aragon with the hope that he'd try to conquer jerusalem
The titles are of the crown, not off the kings
They can't change hands like that
Specially the historic useless ones
[this video] (min 23:29) explains the spanish position on this
before that it also explores the other claims
Walking
Understanding that your political/religious/social values are cultural, and that it might be different elsewhere
Everyone is guilty of ethnocentrism, but I find American on Reddit the biggest culprit
This is a generalisation
Urban areas made with common sense
Football
Yes, that's how it's called
That is our European culture
A cafe bar is very important in every corner
From breakfast to dinner and booze anything you can get from a cafe bar in Europe
Not in Spain
And judging by how much they love fast food, they would love kebabs, I'm in love with that turkish delish
Some hybrids do now
When you see a hybrid marketed as electric with range extender, that's what they mean
Smoking = Tuxedo
Lifting = Face lift
Parking = car park
Autostop = Hitchhiking
Footing = Jogging
Meeting = party conference / political convention
Smoking (Although adapted as "esmoquin") and autostop are also used here
Along with the typical Spanish example, we use "footing" for "jogging".
A tuxedo is a night suit
A smoking jacket (were our smoking comes from) is something fancy men used to wear over their suit while smoking so the smell didn't stick to their clothes
Yes, it is common to write it that way
Meeting is pronounced mitin in Spanish anyway
well, they are used differently than in native English countries
For example if you say "I have a meeting" in English, you probably will not go to a political party conference
VOX (far-right party)
That it changes every few years, stays useless and just creates confusion with each change
Well one thing that (unfortunately) doesn’t change is the emphasis on rote memorization :(
You mean the law
Yeah that's the worst
My brother and I are less than 3 years apart and our educations laws are different
Oof, so true -_-
A few years ago i fell in love with frog legs, french style
Makes me wish frog meat was more predominantly used in the rest of the world
Frogs are eaten in Spain too
Segovia, Extremadura, etc
I don't know because since we don't have a single flag that has no connotations I just can't make a comparison
Wow
Knew nothing about that
And thanks for the note, the appearance is too similar though
I guess it is because Austria’s history is a bit forgotten between the fall of Austria-Hungary and Germany’s annexation, right
All the Spanish flags leaves a sour taste to a lot of people, including the actual flag
In Spain all flags are political and polemic, usually people wearing or having the Spanish flag (the actual country flag) are branded as right-wing nationalist, a lot of left-wing people prefers the 2nd Republic Flag and then we have all the independentists flags of Catalonia, Euskadi, etc
The thing is, Spains flags are all the same (basically) with the exception of second republic (red, yellow, purple) between flags, the only thing that changed was the shield, except for Francos flag, that used an eagle instead of a shield
I would say that Francos is defeneteley the most controversial because dictatorship
Wow, I’m definitely searching for that right now
I guess general history knowledge is based on what affects one’s country (at least what is taught in schools) so it is pretty hard to know all of it
But at least it should get mentioned more often, though
Like the Spanish civil war; it is a conflict that only affected Spain but it is at least known by some people on a superficial level outside Spain
Honestly i dont know and i really dont care what that family does, they have no power
Also its possible that they only waved the flag as a sign of protest that specific time
It really doesnt matter, at least to me
I definitely have to check that out
Austria, in my opinion, is one of the countries in Europe with the most interesting histories, but I knew about the 1800, the most known times of the empire
I think the colors combine OK-ish but can’t avoid associating it with WWI
I guess that is why you said it looks cold and unfriendly, right
Or was it because of the colors themselves
Oh I see
I think now I searched it again with your comment in mind I agree with you
White-black is pretty bad and adding the red makes it even worse
The thing is that it looks like a dark version of the current Netherland’s flag (a standard tricolor with white), which I think makes it look a bit friendlier at first glance, idk
Broken telephone: everyone sits forming a circle
One person creates a message and whispers it in the ear of the person next to them, and that person does the same until the circle is complete
Then the last person says out loud what they heard and the person who started says the original message
The objective is to change the message as little as possible
Dizzy duck: a group of people form a circle and pass a ball between them while one person (the duck) is in the middle tries to intercept it
If the duck gets the ball, the last person who touched it becomes the new duck
The "making laugh game": one person is standing while the rest of the group is sitting
The person standing has to make the others laugh and if they succeed they sit down and the person who laughed is the new comedian
Cops and thieves: like hide and seek but there's a large amount of people who have to seek
At the beginning of the game it's decided by random who is a cop and who is a thief (we said "watermelon, watermelon, you'll be a great cop" and "melon, melon, you'll be a great thief", which rhymes in Spanish) Also, if a thief gets caught, they're transported to the "jail zone" and can be rescued by another one if they manage to get there (which is risky since there's normally a cop there)
English hide and seek: it has nothing to do with hide and seek
It's required to have a lot of space, we used to play in a pavilion
One person, who I'll be refering as "player1" is at one side of the pavilion and the rest of the players at the opposite one
Player1 turns around and says "one two three, the English hide and seek, without moving your hands or feet" (in Spanish it rhymes too) and then looks at the players
While player1 is counting, the players move forward, but when player1 looks at them, the players have to remain still because if they move, player1 can send them back
When eventually one of the players gets to where player1 is, they have to touch the wall and scream "chorizo" (no real reason for this other than an alert for the other players)
Then, player1 has to start running and if they catch another player, this player is the new player1 in the next game
Grandma: similar to English hide and seek but player1 is constantly looking at the other players and to move forward they have to guess what food player1 likes
By turns, all the players say food names and player1 decides how many steps they take based on how much they like this food
The rest of the rules are just like English hide and seek
Same in spain
Hahaha, oh, poor you
English hide and seek, where I come from we call it el pollito inglés
En Galicia lo conocí siempre como el escondite inglés jajaja
I normally say something like 'why should I do that, you won't understand me' (in the language of course), but I dislike the question anyway
I like to make it a sport of saying the most obscene things while smiling, so nobody realises all the gay sexual shit I say I wanna do to them
Like: "Ik Rafael, zou je lekker hard in je kontje nemen en alle hoeken van de kamer laten zien
When they ask what it means, I simply say it means something like "Hi, I'm Rafael and I'm 30 years old
-Si Jo te parle en valenciá tu pots entendre el que te estic dient
(if I speak with you in valencian can you understand what I am saying
They get very confused
It sounds like Spanish but  they can't understand anything
No, and its really awkward
I just say the first lines of El Quijote
"Que más te da lo que diga, si no me vas a entender" ("it doesn't matter what I say, you're not going to understand it anyway")
Neuken in de keuken, its an easy pick up line for when you come to the netherlands
What does that even mean
So I found this gem while looking for its pronunciation:
It seems to be pronounced like the Spanish 'j'. Just learned Spanish is a choking hazard apparently
Oh, that reminds me of a Spanish one: "Tres tristes tigres comían trigo en un trigal
Un tigre, dos tigres, tres tigres
" If you say it really fast you always end up saying "trigres" instead of "tigres" (tigers)
I tend to just say "Qué coño quieres que diga".
Good video indeed, thanks
Spain used to go to war with anyone when it was an empire, but I think we're in good terms with most of our neighbours now
Some people dislike France, some people idolise it
We like Portugal, but it's sometimes considered to be tiny and less important than Spain
We usually fancy Italy, and I'd say they love us back, which is probably the main reason why covid fucked us up
There is one country Spain absolutely hates in this world: Spain
Fix: no fix possible, prepare for civil war
You forgot the issue about Gibraltar
It's a useless grudge but there it is
Most of the people have no problems with it it being British, but because the government has, it is a tax haven
A lot of us here also wish for a federal republic
Left alone or left in the EU
Food or football
Portugal is a place you can get by car easily from Spain, so normally people have great memories of doing short weekend trips to small lovely towns there, or just visiting cities for holidays
I swear everyone I know who has been there talks have nice words for Portugal
and I wish I could say the same about our other neighbours, France
Oh, I like Portugal a lot and I think I even have Portuguese blood on my bloodline
I was just trying to reflect the thoughts of Spanish people in general
It's usually the nationalists that think stuff like that
Actually is our fault: if Spain doesn't recognise Gibraltar as part of UK, it is hard to request data from companies or accounts there and obtain any information
I don't get it
Ceuta y Melilla were Spanish before Morocco existed and they aren't colonies
They are fully Spanish cities with no special clauses
But apart of that, yes, it is pure stubborness and rancid nationalism
The point was that being from Ceuta is the same that being from Madrid
Indian people had no UK passport or the same rights
The only thing special about those territories is they are not part of the iberian peninsula, as Canarias or Baleares
Were they allowed to vote for the UK prime minister/ government ?
[Parchís] is probably the most played
Dominoes is also popular, and there's tons of card games
This looks very similar (and I assume has the same name) as [Juego de la Oca] (The Goose Game) which is a Spanish Classic
edit: found a [wikipedia article] about it
Yo lo domino
La Oca bro
Tiro porque me toca
For Spain i'd arque people know (in order): Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Bilbao, Granada, Santiago de compostela, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, Corduba, Palma
, San Sebastián, Málaga
and then most would start blabbering if they hadn't a long time ago
That leaves Zaragoza over 900
000 inhabitants and Murcia with over 400
000 inhabitants
In the 300
000 there are places like Valladolid and Vigo i bet not even a tenth of foreigners has Heard about
Finally under the 300
000 Mark we start seeing things like Móstoles or jerez de la frontera which i bet are completely unknown outside Spain
Edit: Let me know which cities you know from Spain
Murcia too, seventh largest in Spain but i doubt foreigners know about it
I was going to say this
Valencia is also generally unknown outside of Europe
Look you can stop with the charade
We all know Bielefeld isn’t real
The lonely Planet guide name is: Budapest and Hungary
They're pretty well known, at least for a european audience
>Padua
From the university
>Taranto
From the Roman province
>Messina
I think i've Heard about It
>Prato
Ok, i have no idea where this is
Yeah, i think Russia wins the price in this category, we know Next to nothing of your cities
>Bydgoszcz
I've been to Poland an it's the first time i Hear about it
>Leicester
The football club
>Coventry
Heard about It
>Norwich
Heard about but would really struggle to place It
>Lincoln
Don't know It at all
>Hull
this one's made Up
Isn't It
>Sunderland
Don't think i've Heard about It
>Aberdeen
Yeah, i know this one, though i don't know why
>Inverness
Yeah, i think it's a bit touristy
>Dundee
Yeah, i think it has the worst drug problem in scotland
>I’d be impressed with any foreigners who know more Welsh places than Cardiff and Swansea
You do well, i don't know any
>Derry/Londonderry
Yeah, but it's cheating, i lived a year in Ireland
I had to learn about It
I confirm, i didn't know neither
The foreigners don’t know it and the Spanish try to forget it
Let's go a bit down the list then
Do you know Murcia
Even Santander is more well known than Zaragoza, though perhaps only because of the bank
Sure, by Europeans
* Catalan: Imperi austrohongarès / Àustria-Hongria
* Spanish: Imperio austrohúngaro / Austria-Hungría
Imperio Austro-Húngaro, pretty lame but when you learn about it DAMN is it powerful
Imperio austrohúngaro
We Spanish hate each other more than we hate anybody else
Some people are never on time and have a "pass the bucket" mentality
That we don’t like to work
I mean, not everyone does of course, but sadly more and more teens are refusing to find jobs and just live with their parents’ money
We are not really proud of our country
and that's too bad because I really think that Spain is amazing
Can confirm
I am Spanish and I hate myself
[Damn Spaniards, they ruined Spain
^^That ^^surely ^^applies ^^to ^^every ^^country ^^tho
Did anyone say Spain lol
As a Spanish, I relate
People from northern countries just can't understand what it's like to try to focus at work at over 35° for months
Specially since you can't sleep during summer nights
To be fair, tea is fucking delicious
I don't drink as much as I'd like because I have some mild blood pressure issues and I'm afraid to much tea could worsen them
85% of the world's population would like to be as "poor" as Portugal is
We should put things into perspective
There are many different factors tbh, but it's something historical
No country has been in war against Spain more than Spain itself, and that if you only count our proper civil wars
Before Spain was created, you still had different kingdoms constantly fighting each other, and having their own civil wars as well (Catalan civil war, Navarre civil war, two more civil wars in Castile
Nowadays the problematic regions are mostly Basque country and Catalonia
Terrorism just finished a few years ago in the Basque country, and the roots of that conflict go back to the Civil War, where Franco barely made a genocide against Basques, supported by nazi Germany
Many Basques, catalans, and some Galicians don't consider themselves Spanish at all
Then, even among "proper" Spanish regions, many people just feel an absolute hate against our country, mostly due to our past and our current political situation
We are really critical with ourselves
I think all European countries that have developed a lot relatively recently like Spain, Portugal, Poland, etc
share this feeling
Like, there's this feeling tht we're nearly as good as our neighbors but not quite yet, that we're a bit backwards, so people tend to assume that we're worse than other countries in many topics even if it's not true
And this is something that tends to happen to people of all ideologies
Praise, brother
What are you doing here .
Yeah we usually think the same way about you
I normally just imagine Scandinavians or Russians doing normal life in winter as if extreme cold and darkness can't affect you just because you were born there
Well I can talk for Spain, here you would find AC in stores, supermarkets, public transport
but then it's not common in daily life
It's too expensive for working class to have it at home, and you'll only have it at work if you're lucky
Also it's normally used with certain consideration, so you don't really get cold
Not really
A lot of changes don't actually require touching the Constitution, they can be done by changing one Organic Law or the other
For example, the approval of gay marriage did not require a constitutional reform, it was just done with a modification to the Civil Code
I was centered on the "alarmingly low". It is not really alarming, knowing that major changes can be produced without even touching the constitution, just by twitching organic laws
The Constitution just gives some broad strokes that are developed via organic laws, like the Organic Law on the Electoral Regime, the Organic Law on the Judiciary Power, the Organic Law on the Constitutional Court, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, or even the Organic Law on Ordinary Administrative Procedure
Esquío in Galician (es'ki o)
Ardilla in Spanish (ar 'dee yuh)
AFAIK they are able to pronounce it, aside from typical problems like rolled r.
Squirrel in Spanish is "Ardilla", and came from "Harda", word in a pre-roman language of Hispania
In Asturian it is said esguil from which comes the verb esguilar which means to climb but is also similar to esguila which means quisquilla, a type of shrimp
That hasn't been my experience
Not recognising Kosovo's independence
Not recognising the Armenian genocide
Not recognising Palestine as a sovereign country
I don't get how exactly are we supposed to support the two-state solution without recognising one of the states
Keeping the claim over Gibraltar
Selling weapons to countries with rampant human rights violations
Same here :(
Don’t forget about Western Sahara, that’s still embarrassing
And Kosovo, I don’t agree, it’s like enough  Portuguese come to a corner of Spain and then they declare that corner is not Spain anymore
The international community was too eager to recognize Kosovo without any right just to annoy Serbia
'Ratas' means 'rats' in spanish lol
How weird I haven't seen any news about that apart from what that website says
No, it's just that it hasn't been discussed in congress
It'd most likely be recognised if it was brought up
Catalonia, Basques*
And even if I was against free self-determination of those peoples, I don't think it's the same case
Kosovo declared independence to flee from a government that oppressed them because of their ethnicity
In cases like that one or like colonies, the UN recognises the right for a territory to self determination regardless of what the central government says
It's the same thing with South Sudan, country whose independence we recognised
I guess our politicians think it's different just because it's Europe and a) it gives the impression that in peaceful civilised Europe tht things can happen as well and/or b) very few people would notice about the recognition of a new African country as opposed to an European one
We're military allies with the UK and we don't really need it because we already have control of the strait with Algeciras and Tarifa in the peninsula and Ceuta on the other side
We don't have a practical need for it
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Gibraltar don't want to be part of Spain and it's an issue that sours relations with one of our allies and (at least until Brexit) one of our major trading partners
In my opinion there should be a treaty to settle the issues regarding waters, frontier controls and tobacco trafficking and that's it
Maybe we should keep tht should Gibraltar stop being a British dominion there should be an option to have it join Spain as n autonomous city and that's about it
Although I do think it's more likely that it becomes a city-state
Kosovo yes
The others not really
We don't recognise Palestine because the US doesn't (and neither does your country btw) and we don't recognise the Armenian genocide because it hasn't been discussed
On the other hand, we have recognised South Sudan's independence
I'm fucking done with this planet
Yeah, basically
But what is your solution
That's why I say that there re issues tht need to be settled, issues which we're not going to solve by claiming Gibraltar
Yeah but for it to be a normal UN member state it first needed to be recognised by basically everyone
I'd say no
In spain university admission works with two different marks: 60% the last year of education + 40% a set of exams when the school is finnished and only if the kid has graduated
In serious schools, the school's exams ared courses are muuuuch harder than the state's exam so kids wuth a decent average pass those tests without any problems at all
Extra classes are something that students that struggle pay for but no
It is not usual for kids to really prepare the state tests in academies if they are the smart ones
It's not about harder exams
It's a out higher requirements in daily work
From the get go you know that the school you are doing bachillerato in (that's how the last 2 years of education are called) is difficult (or not)
Over the year you have plenty of oportunities to get your grades up and the hard work means that most certainly you are going to get a better average markin your state's exam (selectividad) than in school
Also, if you are a good student it's not weird that you get your marks up by the end just because of your hard work ( i was terrible in soanish with my teacher and tgen i got a fucking 8/10 in selectividad)
On the other hand you have the schools that are based on passing the state's exam
They inflate your school's marks a lot but tbh all mu friends that went there ended up getting reaaaally mediocre marks in the state's exam
So no, school is not only about exams, daily work counts a lot too
They mske yiu work harder but that doesn't means everything is super hard or that exams are impossible
They are just more on your back about studying and doing more homework and more papers and more about everything
Public schools just don't value daily work as much
If i remember correctly i had lile even a 40% of daily work in many subjects just with the harder homework amd such
Theu dont make super hard exams, rhey just make yoy work harder, making studying for the state exams a cake walk
They are not refrigerated at the store but we put them in the fridge after we buy them
I know some people who keep them out, however
In Spain fridge is the norm
In the UK I see sometimes my friends storaging them at room temperature but I always put them in the fridge at home
Here eggs are sold off a non-refrigerated shelf
But everyone I know puts them in the fridge
Here in Spain everybody put their eggs in the fridge
You won't be able to shell a fridge without one of those specialized egg shelves
If the spanish omelette has to have onion or not
Tortilla with onions or without it
The Flag
it has been [the same flag since 1785] but people have decided that its the flag of fascism, since Francoist spain used it
If only the 2nd republic didnt modify the flag
the 1st republic used pretty much the exact same flag
Another national symbol that changed its meaning due to Francoism was the [Eagle of Saint John] wich was over 3 centuries old but now is considered a symbol of Franco
&#x200B;
Nowadays you might get called a fascist if you wave the spanish flag, depending on the region and the situation
The far left and the independentists preffer the Republican Flag (purple band)

I'd say there's one for every stereotypical karaoke assistant:
- Single/divorced man in his forties looking for his lost youth:
- [Fito y Fitipaldis - La casa por el tejado]
- [Celtas cortos - 20 de abril]
- [Duncan Dhu - 100 gaviotas]
- Young couple of lovers:
- [Carlos Baute and Marta Sanchez - Colgando en tus manos]
- [Alex Ubago and Amaia Montero - Me muero por conocerte]
- Old couple of lovers
- [Pimpinela- Cierra la puerta]
- Old romantic man who thinks he can sing
- [José Luis Perales - un velero llamado libertad]
- [Nino Bravo - un beso y una flor]
- Drunk group of teenagers that would
never be in a karaoke if they weren't completely wasted;
- [El arrebato - Himno del Sevilla C.F.]
But I knew it as Dragostea din tei :(
We have a very famous parody about coming out called [Pluma Pluma Gay] Who's the gay
), I share it with English subtitles
I'm sure it was also sung in karaokes back in the days
Also Amaral - Marta, Sebas, Guille y los demás*
Edit: the real name of the song
There's a 100% chance of La canción del Mariachi, from Antonio Banderas:
Mi gran noche is also a classic
Also Fiesta Pagana forma young people
When I lived in Madrid I drove or use train to go anywhere within the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal and Andorra)
For the rest of Europe I have always use the plane
For me the line is on 3-4 hours by train distance
I live in the North of Spain and to go to Madrid I can choose:
-3 Hours by train from city center to city center
-4 Hours by car, sometimes more depending on the traffic
-40 mins flight, but I have to add the time of transport to the departure airport (20 mins), passing the control (1,5 hours) and moving from Barajas to the city center (30 mins)
At the end of the day if the price is ok I prefer to go by train much more, easier and more calm
I used to fly every time I wanted to go to a different European country because train trips take much longer and are more expensive than a plane one, even to our closest neighbours
However, the pandemic has made me more fearful and wary of air travel so I might do things differently once I'm allowed and can afford to leave Spain again
I’m from Alicante and if I go to Barcelona I’ll go by air
Intra-iberian travel by train, car or bus
Outside of that, plane
I know Galicians that will take flights when going to Madrid or further south, though
Especially people from A Coruña. It's really remote
My family did drive up to Frankfurt with many stop-overs once, and we did take the night train to Paris once, but that was for the experience
It was really fun btw
I'm pretty sure there's some rail sizing differences between Spain and the rest of Europe so you gotta switch trains in Barcelona when going Europe-wards anyways (at least that's where the night train to Paris was departing), so that takes a bit of the incentive out of it
When I travel Europe again I hope to do it by train
Not even to Brussels or Dusseldorf
(just as examples)
Depends on the number of passengers and the type of car you're driving
I found [this pdf] comparing different types of transportation (gCO2/kilometer/passenger) if you want to check it out
Had a feeling that that was your reason hehe
Interesitng, although I found the consumption rates of those cars and their contamination super high
My Peugueot 208 for example manages to do waaaaay better than those
Although that may be because it is dated 2008 and we have gone a super long way from there in terms on car efficiency
Oh damn I didn't notice that it's that old
But yeah, even an old, small car is better than a plane, even if you're travelling alone
Every time someone refers to a country as "Socialist" and it's not the USSR, Cuba or North Korea, you can probably close the video/article/web page
It's such a lazy shortcut
I understand it might make sense to a US audience, but outside of the US media bubble it's meaningless
[From the CIA World Factbook] "Sweden’s small, open, and competitive economy has been thriving and  Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living with its combination  of free-market capitalism and extensive welfare benefits
All EU countries have a mix of free market, regulations, state intervention, low-to-high taxes and some level of welfare
Also, it's also really funny to me how the US is obsessed with the same 3 countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark), and rarely mention Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal
The entirety of Spain is Andalucía and the only food is paella
This is not México
It's not the same
These are two completely separate countries

Somehow, in Spanish dubbing, you have the same accent as Germans
Lovers of the arctic circle, Spanish movie by Julio Medem
To add a little bit to this:
-flamenco is the traditional dance of only one of the 17 regions
In most of the country flamenco is almost as foreign as the Norwegian language
-bullfighting: we don't spend our days seeing that shit
In fact, it's a dying tradition that might soon disappear
-siesta: again, its popularity is hugely overstated
It made sense back when most people were farmers and had to stop working in the afternoon because it was too hot (that's exactly where the name comes from), but nowadays, with AC and a faster, more comfortable life, as the meme says, ain't nobody got time for that
-paella: believe it or not, we don't eat that every day
-relugion: I'm tired of Spanish people being portrayed as Catholic fanatics
In fact, our country has lost its faith faster than any other country in Europe (only after Belgium, I think)
After several years in Germany, Deutschland is definitely waaay more religious, in some cases to a medieval degree that would never be allowed in Spain (Tanzverbot
What the ultrafuck is that
-related to this, the inquisition
Sure, it was bad and somehow it lasted until the early 19 century, but compared to the shit that happened north of the Pyrenees, it was a joke
Take a look at the number of "witches", Jews or random people killed in Germany, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands or even Sweden
They're just trying to cover it so tourism doesn't low

Every variation of it I had was delicious
In many part of the country, we do eat "rice with stuff" (Valencians will get upset if you call it paella) very often
It's tradition in my area, in Eastern Andalusia, to have paella on sundays
Not everyone, not all sundays, but it's definitely a common meal in many areas of the country
I think the US only had the Salem trials, no
Businesses usually close at 2PM for a couple of hours because it's lunchtime and when other people go back home from early morning shifts, so it is not worth to be open during that time
nothing to do with siesta
That's not necessarily because of the siesta
There is still the idea that people should eat at home with their families, and not at work
People (and the government) are increasingly against it: taking two hours in the afternoon to go home, cook and eat means that we leave work two hours later, which means that other evening activities are delayed too, which might not be sometimes very healthy (it doesn't help that most of the country is pretty warm during large part of the year, that our time zone is wrong, that our days during winter and autumn are longer thanks to being in the south
More and more people prefer to eat a salad in 15 minutes at the office and then get out sooner so that they have more time for sport, the kids, reddit or any other hobby
In other words, be more like the rest of Europe
Yeah, "siesta" is literally the Spanish word for "nap". Having an awful work schedule is not siesta
Yes, I loved riding my bike when I was little
One of my favourite summer pastimes was to throw myself down slopes without holding the handlebars and feeling the coolest
That shit is in the Dad Guide
My dad did that to me and i ran into a lamp post
You should exercise even if you're thin
Exercise is good for you for way more things than your weight or body fat and you could be unhealthy even if you're thin
Don't get me wrong, I don't exercise either because of lack of free time, but I should do it
Everyone should
16th and 17th spanish tercios
The French are *franchutes* or *gabachos,* the Portuguese are *lusos*, and Northern tourists, especially from the British isles, Germany, etc
are *guiris*.
No, we only have offensive ones (that doesn't mean we hate our neighbors)
Sorry to dissapoint you bro
As for the (kind of) offensive (for someone and just funny for others) nouns, where I'm from:
Franchute / gabacho (it doesn't translate to anything) for frenchmen
Piratas (pirates) for Englishmen, because a lot of the pirates that stole gold from spanish ships that came to Spain from America were from England
Cabeza cuadrada (square head) for Germans (not because of the form of the head but because they want things done one way and they don't usually improvise, or that does the steriotype say)
Spaguetti for italians
Moro (moor) for Morocans (or any northern african or middle eastern)
Panchito (no translation) for latin americans
Yankees for americans (people from the USA)
We also have a lot of those "offensive" names for people from other provinces within Spain
We call fren people "Gabachos". Which apparently comes from Gavach,  an occipital word meaning "from Provenza" and which usually was synonym of stupid
The Frenchs Gabachos or Franchutes
The British pirates
The Britishs/Germans who are young and drunk in the beach "Carrots"
Whatever, swamp germans
This
In spain I think we only have this names for frenchies
USAmericans are not gabachos, that's French
Gringos o yanquis only
True
Everyone above France is a guiri
From the regional ones my favourite is godos (goths)
It is used in the Canary Islands for mainland Spaniards
Another offensive one: we call "vuelcafrutas" to the frenchmen, just because some time ago they overturned spanish trucks with fruits in what was some sort of protest
TIL
Well, sudaca ia truly offensive (in my opinion), thats why i didnt talk about it
I don't think I've ever herd gabacho about any country
Yeah, kind of, I mean, all the other nicknames I said you can use them jokingly of offensively, depending on the tone and context, but sudaca is offensive 100%
They gave more importance to the Spanish Civil War
First we're taught extensively about our Civil War and how it served as a prelude for WW2
Then we're mostly taught about the European theater: Axis ivasions and early victories, oppression during the occupation and the Holocaust, invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union joining the Allies and winning in the Eastern Front, the Normandy Landing and the defeat of Germany and Italy
Then we have a page of the Pacific theater and the atomic bomb
The invasion of China and Japanese war crimes, the African theatre, the role of smaller countries and colonies and even the role of Spain (except a paragraph about the Hendaye meeting between Franco and Hitler and the Blue Division) are all heavily downplayed
The 16th-17th century
American conquest, first global power and all that
The tercios etc
The ultranationalist party VOX used as slogan in their last campaign *La reconquista*, the period between years 700 and 1400 approx where the Christians recovered all the territory previously lost to the Muslims (you probably see the racist connection)
Other than that, all the nationalists like to remember the huge Spanish empire and wellness of what we called *the Golden century* (XVI century)
Reconquista
Proper nationalists would romanticise the Empire, people who are just far conservative more than patriotic would turn more to the Reconquista
The empire and the dictatorship
Well they actually are and still blaming us for the stolen gold
Anyways as the other comment says, nationalists are a real small minority in Spain
In Reconquista, most Muslims converted to Christianity (and the ones that didn't convert, moriscos, left to Africa)
A lot of people in Southern and Eastern Spain are descendants of converted Muslims
It was not specially genocidal
The Renconquista had nothing to do with the Empire, and I literally never heard about any genocide during that period, only Christian kings starting many different little wars against the moors for personal interests along centuries
In my opinion we can only talk about a proper "Reconquista" in the last period, with the Catholic Kings
The only poultry you can find in virtually every Spanish supermarket is chicken and turkey
In areas with a lot of hunting activity it is not unusual to find game like duck and partridge but even then it is not so common so eat them
These two birds in particular are often sold in the rest of the country already cooked and tinned as a delicatessen
Apart from that, duck is a staple of Asian restaurants but not as popular as chicken, beef and pork dishes
Not unheard of, but normally eaiting poultry means 99,9% is chicken
Maybe turket in processed food, but duck is more of a novelty than any other thing
Adding a bit more to this, perhaps not in every supermarket, but I’d say that duck, quail and partridge are not that difficult to find in cities
Even guineafowl is sometimes available
You won’t be able to find it in supermarkets, but some butchers and some of the larger supermarkets have them available sometimes
Goose is way more uncommon than in other European countries though
Pigeon is also seen as game
For Spain i would say [La Línea de la Concepción.]  A lot of drug traffic and marginal zones, but there are some very nice parts and a great view of Gibraltar
Edit: And also the many tourist towns ([Salou] [Magaluf] [Playa den Bossa] etc
) A lot of tourists messing around, drugs and alcohol
I'm starting to see a patern here
This question comes up roughly every month
For Spain i nominate Algeciras and Parla
For their soulless architecture and lack of historical buildings
Not ugly but fairly opressive, but that's a given considering the environment
One of the cities in Cowboy Bebop is heavily inspired by this city and it's great
We mainly joke about the andalusian accent, but also about the other 15 accents that you can find in Spain
When I lived in Madrid people from the city center, where I worked, would sometimes mock my Madrid's east-outskirts accent (ejjjjque)
Madrid has many accents for such a small province
I don't understand, what do you mean you don't spell the *c*?
Wait so any /k/ sound is replaced by an aspirated sound
So *cosa* is pronounced *'osa*?
That's really interesting
Such a big difference
Does if happen for every /k/ sound or there are rules
Ok that makes more sense
Although it says it's post vocalic rather than intervocalic
Can you think of a word in Italian like that
As a Spaniard it's fun to find out /θ/ is used in an Italian dialect
People have said that for a long time to justify the lack of government intervention in the economy to fight climate change
It doesn't seem to be working
At least not fast enough
And it's not like we have time to spare
Sure, some economic sectors are already starting to earn a lot of profits from renewables and recycling and electric vehicles and whatnot
But the car and fossil fuels corporations and lobbies are far more powerful
And why would they care about the future
They've been hoarding money for decades
Don't worry, they'll be unaffected by whatever happens in this next century because of our failure to take action on an issue we've known about for 60byears
With Spanish, just any time anybody switches b and v, ll and y or g and j since they sound exactly the same
Also, when people forget to use h, since it is completely silent
This one hurts me especially, it's just so hard to read when it happens
People that use "me se" instead of "se me" deserve a special place in hell
It's a lot more common in spoken Spanish, though
Well, ll and y shouldn't. No yeísmo ftw
If we think about it we know what's the correct one but for some reason we don't do it naturally
Because of this it's now officially accepted to say "le" instead of "lo" only to refer to people and other variations will probably end up being accepted as well
I spent half of my childhood spelling yendo as llendo
It was so embarrassing when I found out the truth
Is it officially accepted
Thought it was only recognized as being common in certain parts of the world/regions, but not actually proper/correct
*El motivo por (el) que
Yep
>En el Esbozo de una nueva gramática de la lengua española (RAE, 1973) se condena el leísmo referido a cosa, pero se permite el referido a persona masculina singular; el leísmo plural siempre ha sido censurado por la Academia, ya que su baja incidencia desde los textos castellanos más antiguos atestigua que tampoco lo ha sancionado nunca mayoritariamente el uso de los hablantes cultos

"Despicable me" is translated as "Gru: my favourite villain".
My favourite one is *Knight and Day* being translated as *Noche y Día* (***Night*** *and Day*)
Not a translation but Shaun of the Dead was called "Zombies Party" in Spain
A lot of light comedies get translations that have nothing to do with the original title so that they rhyme or sound catchy
A few others that latinos love
* Un Canguro Superduro (a super tough nanny)  -The Pacifier
* La Jungla de Cristal (The Glass Jungle) - Die Hard
* Tu a Londres y yo a California (You off to london and me to california) - The Parent Trap
* Dos Colgados Muy Fumados (two loonies very stoned) - Harold and Kumar go to White Castle
Theres one specially bad called ["Cole Cole Que Te como",] (run run im gonna eat you) mocking the supposed inability of chinese people to pronounce a hard R (Corre corre)
Originally  **We’re Going to Eat You, 1980**
In Spain "Despicable Me" was translated as "Gru, my favorite villain"
Also, "Hard to kill" is the same translation they made in Latin America
Better than "Glass Jungle".
latinos did the same thing with die hard, called it "Duro de matar" - Hard/Tough to kill
In Spanish it was simply "Forget me"

I wouldn't say they are the norm here but they're fairly common
I have always had that type of windows in my house
They are normal to see here
Not universal here, specially for the big ones that also serve as doors but anyway they aren't rare either
If you renovate the windows you will probably put these
It is one of the things I miss since I moved to US, proper windows
And not only for the tilt-turn ones, but also for proper shutters installed on the outside
Those that can block the light completely, allowing you to sleep during the mornings
It might not look fancy in those all glass building, but damn they are practical
In Spain we have this guy "ride me five" he goes all around Africa, North to South on his motorbike
He's super natural, just records his experience and feelings
Whenever he has a mechanical problem he has to solve it on his own, cuz the African mechanics just don't fix his problems
Amazing
Alexelcapo for gaming videos, I really like his honesty and sense of humour

I love dogs and I love some cats too (the nice ones), but a lot of them are assholes
Spanish people tend to prefer dogs in general
No idea about the continent
They say dogs are man's best friend, but the cat will never tell the police where the drugs are
Hahaha this is confusing usually the "known" languages in Spain are Spanish, Catalan, Vasque and Galitian
Occitan normally is one of the lesser known laguanges, these 5 languages are official in their communities but there's also more, like asturleones, aragones or this weird whistling communication method of Canary Islands "silbo gomero" (not really a language but it's worth to check out)
You forgot a very important one: galician, spoken in Galicia and in some areas of León and Asturias
It is very similar to portuguese as they were the same language in the middle ages
Also, there are some other minor and non official languages such as asturiano/astur-leonés and aranogese
Also in Melilla many people speak cherja, a bereber language
In Spain there's also Aragonese, which is only spoken in the Northern mountains of Aragon, and Asturleonese, which is spoken mainly in Asturias (where it's protected and in the way of becoming co-official) and in a few some rural areas of the former region of Leon and in Extremadura
Both were slowly replaced by Castilian since the Late Middle Ages
Before, Asturleonese was spoken in all of the kingdom of León (except Galicia) and Aragonese was spoken in Southern Navarre, all of the kingdom of Aragon proper and the Western regions of the kingdom of Valencia
Those last two areas are nowadays the parts of Navarre and Valencia where Castilian/Spanish is the native language instead of Basque and Valencian Catalan
There's also Montañés or Cantabrian, spoken in Cantabria, which is debated whether is a dialect of Asturleonese, a transition between Asturleonese and Castilian or if nowadays we can consider it a dialect of Castilian because of the huge influence that language has had in the dialect
There are also two languages of ethnic minorities: Caló, the traditional language of the Romani in Spain (tho I've never heard it) and the Ladino, the language spoken by the Sephardic Jewish people
Ladino originally was a mixture of Castilian and Hebrew, kinda like Yiddish was a mixture if German and Hebrew, but nowadays has Arabic, Greek and Turkish influences due to the Sephardic diaspora after the expulsion
There are very few Sephardic Jews in Spain, tho, since very few Sephardic families decided to return after freedom of religion was established in the 19th century
It's way more common in Israel, Turkey, Morocco and Greece
But it's a language native to Spain so I think it should be considered
Galician in Spain
You missed that one :(
In Spain we have 4 official languages: Spanish Catalan, Basque, and Galician
The other languages aren't official
I like to call Galician the midpoint between Spanish and Portuguese, and Catalan the midpoint between Spanish and French, because they are pretty similar to both (for example, Galitians can understand perfectly the Portuguese and Portuguese can understand perfecto y Galitians)
Basque I'd a prerromanic language, so it doesn't have a lot to do with the other languages in Spain
In Spain we have from East to West:
-Catalan/Valencian/Mallorquin (basically the same language), Mediterranean Area
-Aranese (Occitan), spoken in the Vall d'Aran in the Pirinees
-Fabla, also in the Pirinees
-Basque, Preindoeuropean language
-Asturian/Leonés/Cántabro (again basically the same language), Cantabric Mountains
-Gallego, in the area just North of Portugal
All these languages developed due to the isolation during the moorish conquer and later Reconquista of the Peninsula in the middle ages
Edit: grammar
Not sure if they are considered a language, but I have seen there are entire articles written in Asturianu and Extremeñu in Wikipedia
(Asturian and Extremaduran)
I think they resemble more like a form of broken castillian
Also,remember minority non-oficcial languajes like aragonese,astur-leones,aranese,portugese(speaked in a border zone called olivenza) and silbo(a languaje wich consists of whistles in one of the islands of the canary islands)
and valencian is considered a separate language to the catalan,even tough two speakers(a catalan and a valencian) can hold a conversation without dificulties
Actually those are the languages that are recognised as co-official in some regions (and so more spoken), but there is also:
* [Aragonese] spoken in Aragón
* [Caló] spoken by the Spanish and Portuguese Romani
* [Riffian] and Arabic spoken in Ceuta and Mellilla
As a curiosity, in the Gomera island there is also a non-verbal language: the [Silbo Gomero] (composed by different whistles) used by the locals to comunicate up to a distance of 5km across the ravines and valleys of the island
Also Aragonés (very small in speakers) and Aranes
Yeah sure I wasn't criticizing,I just found it funny
Some years ago while I was flighing outside Spain I started talking with an Aussie tourist that was returning from a 2 weeks trip all over Spain (including Catalonia & Valencia), he discovered about the existence of the other spanish languages from me, while leaving the country, inside the plane
Sure, but OP currently mentioned it in the post
> and valencian is considered a separate language to the catalan
No philologist or academy has ever made such a claim, that's just some political bullshit
Yeah I know they exist (except silbo, it's the first time I hear about it xd), but the only one I heared in my life was Astur-leones, so I don't know a lot about them
Basically not, they are literally the same language, those are just local accents
[Vall d'Aran
Hes treating andalusian, canarian and castillian as if they were consider diferent languages when it's not, maybe spanish is distinct in those areas but is faaaaar faaar away from being a language on their own
Source: I'm a castillian living with a canarian roomate and i have spoken qith plenty of andalusians througth my life
I live in a rural town (20
000 people) and don't own a car
Sometimes I go with my friends on trips in their car, but everyday there's no need for one
There's a bus station less than 1 km away that can take me into a city that has a train station, so I can get to any major city using strictly the bus and trains
To go across town and to stores or the pharmacy I walk or take my bike
The town is basically a circle and I can cross it in 15 minutes biking
Yes, there are no buses with a schedule that works for me to go where I study, so from Monday to Friday, I have to go in car
Right now someone else that can drive has to take me there, but I want to get the driving license so I can go wherever, whenever I want without worrying about schedules or if there is a bus available
The public transportation here in Mallorca is not good enough
I *could* live without a car, but it would be significantly more inconvenient
I spend around 40 minutes daily going to and from univerity by car and it'd be close to 2 hours if I went by bus instead
That's a lot of time when you start adding up, and it's not like I have plenty of free time to spare
I use the car much less for personal reasons
However, there are no night buses in my town, and I pretty far at the outskirts, so I usually take the car if I go to have dinner with friends in a central place
I could take a taxi but I don't think it's worth the money if I'm only going to have dinner, and I could do the return trip home walking, but again we're comparing 10 minutes to almost 1 hour, and uphill
Self imposed (because it’s a looooot faster), but yes
I’m trying to get my ass off my laurels, though, and get at least the A1 motorbike license
Most of the time I’m driving alone, so it reeeeeeealy doesn’t make sense to drive a 5 door car just to haul one single person
The fact that you have to sit through (less) traffic is a plus, but I feel very embarrassed driving a car just for one
E: Although if I have to go to the office, it’s very impractical to try to park in the city centre, so I don’t actually mind taking public transport then
Kinda
I'm in a 20k inhabitant town, where you can walk anywhere and I have everything I need to live, but when I go out with friends or want to go shopping, I usually go to a couple of cities that are within 40 km, for that I use my car
Public transport to those cities is bad
Bus to Oviedo (19 km away) doesn't pass too often, and to Gijón (35 km away) there's only a train that takes 1 hour
Also after going there I'd need to use the public transport inside those cities to go wherever so (if i lived there I could use a bike, I guess) ... It takes twice or three times as much than going by car
I didn't get a driver licence until a year ago (I'm 31) and I never suffered for it
Even now I use the car as little as possible, if it's 25 minutes away by foot I'll walk, and if it can be reached with public transport also within reasonable time I'll pick that over driving
Not from Spain, but until recent years it was legal in Iceland to kill Basque people
Sarajevo
Nasty things happened there to a member of my family
No, I was concerned about talking about this, but anyway
My uncle is militar and went with the UN
He remained three months completely silent looking at the infinite after he come back home
Today is still a forbidden topic
Well, we have cave paintings from prehistoric era, they are not Spanish (since Spain as a nation is a recent concept) but yeah, we have old stuff here
>Altamira's fame stems from the fact that its paintings were the first European cave paintings for which a prehistoric origin was suggested and promoted
I live minutes away from Qart Hadasht or Cartago Nova, the headquarters of Hannibal and the Carthaginians in Spain and it's quite thrilling for me
There's even a [functional Roman theater]  from the time
In general, there are a lot of ruins from the Roman time around Spain, to the point it's difficult to build a parking lot or a subway since you can find ruins "easily".
A lot of Moor ruins from the middle age can also be easily found
In my city a lot of malls or parking lots that were planned couldn't be built because they kept finding Muslim baths or ruins
Romanesque churches, also from the middle age, can also be found around the place easily
I guess it's proportional to the time a certain civilisation remains, and it depends on the kind of civilisation it was
Romans were crazy engineers and architects and they were around for centuries, so it's only natural there's a lot of Roman constructions still today
The same for Moors
Also, they wrote a lot of stuff
The more you write, the more information you give about your civilisation
In Rome there were guys like Dion Casio who wrote almost the whole History of their time, and documents like Historia Augusta are direct text books from the time
[Palmeral or Elche]
Not a lof of ruins in the city (destroyed or buried), but the Palmeral is the living proof of centuries of development by different cultures
In Spain is very common to find ruins, I've even helped archeologists to map a Roman metal facility with drones
There are zones, like Madrid, where it's really difficult to build in some areas because every time you dig, ruins appear and they're protected, you can't continue building
well if you talk abaut artifacts of museum its harder than you thing but we have many zones but honestly in the cities not that much now,
Abaut historical building and all of that yes just in front of my school we have a palace of the XIV and my school itself its a palace of the XV
In my city before the destruction of almost all of the palace we where the second city of europe with more just behind of Florence with around 360 now we have 36 and some reconverted, the churches has also be damaged specially with the period of Mendizabal and a great part of the churches are now administrative buildings, also for example the church of San Benito wich was almost as big and rich as the cathedral becouse it was one of the core centers of the order of the Benedictians, this building has its 2 upper plant demolish for bad condition
&#x200B;
So yes Europe was and still rich in historical building but at least Spain has lost a lot of it
&#x200B;
Edit: i almost forget to say the name of my city, i live in Valladolid
I just watched in the news a 5000 years old Necropolis was found in a cave, so when they study it well have more info about our history
my school is a palace from the XV
that was pretty common even in roman periods
the constantin arch for example, or a lot of the greek bronze statues to make others
well this are just preference
we have some here also due to the civil war
in Barcelona, you can pay either by cash (in bus only for a single ticket) and in the metro with the ticket machines you can buy tickets
The thing is our tickets are so old fashioned that it's still cardboard, single use type of tickets
Not contactless or anything like that, and if its a ticket that you need to count the remaining trips, it'll be printed on the back side
It can also happen that you buy these monthly or three months pass ticket, but it's still gonna be cardboard, which sucks because it always breaks
So, in the entrance, for the metro you need to have a ticket, or you can't get in, and in the bus you may pay to the driver for a single ticket (which is of course super expensive) but nothing else
In Madrid you can get an [_abono_] (travel card) that you pay for monthly
I believe it’s around 55€ Flat rate per month, or 20€ if you’re under 26, for all of the central zone, which covers a huge portion of the city
All busses, metro, and cercanias (suburban lite rail) are included (inside zone 1)
You can also buy a metro card and buy individual trips for it which cost 1,50€ per trip
You can buy these at any metro station
You can pay cash on busses, once again 1
50€ per trip, but they only accept maximum 5€ notes
I’ve seen master card and visa stickers on some busses which leads me to believe that they are phasing in contactless payment, but I’ve only seen it a few times and never actually tried paying that way
That would be very handy because there have been several times that it’s been the day that I have to top my card up for the month and haven’t had less than 5€ notes to get on the bus to go to the metro station to top my card up
NFC cards from the company of public transport of the Balearic Islands, or with cash, although I think they only accept 5€ notes
You won't be able to pay with credit or debit cards not with your phone
You can get a public transportation card and recharge it however you prefer (debit card, cash, etc)
Madrid had the old cardboard tickets with the tick marks until last year when they replaced them with a plastic card
Unfortunately now you have to pay 2
50 or 3€ for the new card just to load it with viajes, so I suppose the Madrid Metro system is making some nice profits off everyone spending 3€ extra every time they visit
Especially because I have a stack of tourist abonos at my house but every time someone comes to visit, there’s no way to get it to them unless I meet them at the airport so they have to buy a new one
To be fair, Madrid has some of the best public transport I’ve ever seen, and 1,50€ per trip is a pretty good deal, so 3€ extra is a small price to pay when you compare it to transport costs in Paris, Berlin, or London
when i went to madrid i remember paying more for that plastic card, but if its possible to get the money back by giving the card back (like the oyster in london) then i see no issue with paying 3 euros for it tbh
The most common saying in Spain is ‘patata’ (potato)
Some of the regions with their own official languages may use others though
patata
it looks like you are just screaming in terror
"Patata" which is obviously potato, and when we grew up we changed to "whisky". But patata is the real one
I've seen the "whisky" thing when you just want to be funny when you're 9 years old saying "taboo" words
Even adults lol
Yeah, that’s so true
Perhaps the idea behind it is that all those /a/ can force your mouth in the shape of a more open laugh
Oh so you are from Spain
Do you support Real Madrid or Barcelona
- I don't like football
This happens everywhere I go
"how do you like Spanish omelette
if there are 2 or more people from Spain you will provoke a war that won't end well
I'm mixed genetically and culturally from two nations so when people ask me where I'm from and I say 'half A and half B' after hearing the A part they don't hear the B part and only concentrate on the A. So it's kind of annoying because I can't really claim to be just from one place
Usually after knowing the nationality you don't ask if we like chorizo in paella or tortilla de patatas with or without onion
It is not good
For American: You don't ask where in Mexico/South America is Spain
or say that I'm not black so I should not be Spanish
Thanks
This happens a lot, I don't like football at all and I don't care about it
I don't have anything against people who like it
Funny, I was to post the same exact question and my answer is the same too
Why do they always ask it
Oh god, same
I just say "Barcelona haha" and go on
Even if Idk anything about football nor care about it
Specially middle easterners, some guys seem to care more about the Barça/Madrid thing than most spaniards

We are the country which has gone bankrupt more times in history, like 15 or so
we were the first to calculate correctly latitude and longitude and the first mapping the pacific ocean for example
Spanish Marines Corps is the oldest in the world
Shortest border in the world in the Peñón Velez de la Gomera, with Morocco
74 meters
Oldest military unit in the world, King's Own Immemorial 1st Infantry Regiment, dating back to 1248
Oldest marine corps in the world
The Spanish Marine Infantry was formed in 1537
Largest olive oil producer
First woman to be depicted on a US stamp and an US coin was Queen Isabella I of Castille
Very interesting
We are leaders in organ transplants too
I would deeply ponder the meaning of life
I'm Spain the F1 and Moto GP can drive people crazy too
A lot of people follow the motor sports (F1, Moto GP), Tennis and Basketball quite a lot too ... Although going crazy on them like we do on football, I'd say that's only the case for Basketball in the Balcans area
I mean, it can always get crazy in Europe regardless of the sport, but football levels of crazyness isn't as common with other Sports
Tennis is general is pretty chill
That's probably the most peaceful sport generally xd
It's rather because they just changed the word "football" to "soccer" so they coud coin the first to mean something completely different of their own
American Football can barely be called football
Indeed, but I gave up with Valentino Rossi, emperor of the track
In fact, Sete Gibernau was an eternal second, which is actually not that bad
But always at the shadow of Valentino
The point is that Valentino was also a honest rider, no tricks involved, only massive speed
I didn't knew that part
It seems to be a double risk for the drivers
Helmet always on
Yes, and this is the proof that a slight difference in this sport makes a huge difference on the results
We'd just be wondering why everyone is sitting down to have dinner at 7pm
The Spaniard probably would be still working in his job afternoon/evening shift while the rest of Europeans have dinner
And anyway, dinner is less important in Spain
The main meal where all the family gather is lunch
But nobody remembers Spain introducing potatoes to Europe
Lot of Olive oil in that table
At 18 I'm still at work, how am I supposed to eat dinner
Though most likely Spain would have brought a 12-pack of shitty beer instead, offending all their South Europeans brothers
I love the history of the colonies
Like how they developed and grew and how lives were there and the relationships with the natives and the guerrillas and all that
But usually colonies are just taught as like "EMPIRE": GOLD, MONEY, WARSHIPS and all that stuff
Which is also cool but you know
The Americas did not belong to the *kingdom* of Castille, but they did belong to the *crown* of Castille
This was because the crown of Castille consisted of [***several***] kingdoms
We were taught that one of the reasons of the inability of the Crown of Aragon to do much was due to the fact that it consisted of several kingdoms with conflicting interests
without mentioning that Castille *also* consisted of billions more kingdoms (plus the overseas kingdoms
So apparently, Castille was this single cohesive unit that was efficient, where as Aragon was fragmented and chaotic
Right
(Can you tell I was educated in Madrid
E: context: I always found the politization of our history in the Catalonian education system very weird, “but at least they didn’t do the same here”. I was such a sweet summer child back then  Actually, now that I think about it, we weren’t really taught anything about any of the individual kingdoms in the crown at all, but that might have been due to lack of time
They don't teach you the 80 years war
I really don't get it
Like most of it ocurred in belgium or the entherlands: maastrich, breda, antwerp, Empel, nieuwport, ostende, etc etc etc
Like today's belgium was under the spanish monarchy, they fought constanly in the wars
In Spain is usually called the war of Flandes
Yeah
My peruvian friend was taught that Spain stole all their gold, whereas I was told that we took all the gold to pay foreign bankers (to fund wars)
So Spain was essentially a node in a global conveyor belt of gold
Well, to be fair "Belgium" was the Roman name of the region so it had been used to refer to the Low Countries in general since the Renaissance
Including the Netherlands
So back then it wasn't that much about later Belgian national identity
I think the first Japanese dictionary was in Portuguese, before they expelled the Jesuits
I think it depends
In my experience it was talked about but overall the colonial history of Spain was taught in an extremely condensed way
The focus is put mostly on the events that succeded in Europe during those centuries
Lol not at all
It is teached as one of the wars in which spain spent a part of its enormous fortune just to keep it catholic and under spanish rule
Our armed forces day is celebrated after the Empel's miracle and we are taught as a fucking useless war in which spain wanted to fight because of honor (not kidding, actuall history) while at the same time we fought the french, the turks, the english, the scotts and the other half of europe
Fun fact: there is an expression in spanish that would be like "putting a pyke in Flanders" when something is veeery costly in money and other resources
Tgis comes fron the fact that spanish troypes would use the "spanish road", a logistic setup (kind of impressive) in which men were shipped to genoa and walked through milan, switzerland the frankish-county and other german catholic nations up to flanders
This eas only pissible because spain was stinky ritch back then
Probably the shared news here about the Catalonia's issue
Although it's true that no Spanish or Catalan media is unbiased, it's like Catalonia's news in foreign media\* are written from what some random "expert" has told, instead of more extensive and true explanations
Some news were like we were going to have Yugoslavia 2
0, instead of what it is: a political shitshow to blame each other
Gibraltarian claiming in r/badhistory, of all places, that Spanish schools silence the Spanish Armada and the fact that the English sunk every single Spanish ship
While in reality, the Armada is overrated in schools if anything (there is no mention of the Counterarmada and the fact that the peace treaty was favorable to Spain, for one), and the fate of every Spanish ship is accesible to anyone with access to Wikipedia:
- 7 lost to the English (1 of them sunk)
- 30 or so sunk on rough weather during the trip back around Ireland and Scotland
- Maybe 30 more scuttled after making it to port due to damage
- About 60 more intact
I honestly think all Southern European countries can be considered culturally Mediterranean
Portugal has culturally a lot more in common with Italy than with Britain, even if both are Atlantic
Not to mention she was quite outside the KGB jurisdiction, being from Yugoslavia
I've heard this about Romania IRL hahaha

Let's say that our former King Juan Carlos hasn't been the most loyal to his wife and hasn't been very good managing money
And both things are kind
of connected
King Juan Carlos II and a leaked photo with his grandson next to a dead elephant they just shot dead in a hunting safari (he was honorable member of the animal's rights ngo WWF at that time)
He just gave a poor apology in national TV and that was it
Also recently after he abdicated and his son took the throne, he left the country to "avoid damaging the royal family image" and was found in UAE, where he resides now
I just saw a video about him the other day
It was so crazy watching how he became a celebrity (and also alphabetized) behind bars writting books for children and a questionable biography
He sure lived and died like a rockstar
Indeed
I think he was the personification of perversion
He took the advantage of being the rags-to-rich story line and the "changed person" to clean his image and keep killing prostitutes while investigating the murders
I bet that when they discovered the truth, he had a surprised pikachu face
Barbie Girl by Aqua, it felt like my childhood was torn down
It changes my views on songs from my childhood
For example i heard ["That don't impress me much"] for the first time in 10 years and i thought the lyrics were really pretentious and that they didn't fit some parts of the song
They exist and they are somewhat popular, some children do, but it's not a tradition at all
As a kid, I didn't like them and never wanted to go there because I didn't like the idea of some people taking care of my who weren't my parents and sleeping outside of my house ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
My brother, some of our friends an me where send to summer camps a couple of years
One of those friends now works there in summer
They are pretty popular, every year there is a long waitlist to the most popular places
To apply to one you do it like for university: you chose five and put in a preference list; there is also a point system that puts you next year at the top of the list if you didn't get in
I went since I was 8 until I was 13
And no, I didn't drink alcohol or had sex on them
I guess they considered those safe ages and avoid older teenagers
Congratulations
Ironic
They could save others from non-question posts
But not themselves
The tragedy of Darth Modis the powerhigh
Literally never
I only went when I was 7 because I had a tooth coming while the old one didn’t fall yet
They took it out and the new one aligned perfectly
I don’t know, my teeth aren’t crooked at all (God bless my genetics for this), never had any pain and I have good dental hygiene so I never needed it
Reading the comments here are making me think I should go more D:
Just got my yearly cleanup this week (which is done by an hygienist but in the same clinic as the actual dentist one, so "going to the dentist" sometimes refers to the clinic and not to the professional)
My insurance recommends 2 per year but my cleanups last 10-15 minutes and I don't get too much tartar from year to year so my hygienist says that once per year is more than ok
I still got pending for later this month my also yearly dental checkup and orthodontics checkup, so in a normal year I go 3 times but with three different professionals and around the same dates
I honestly don't know what's the average
I started to actually care much more about my dental care visits since I spent a fortune in the orthodontist
Once or twice a year, depending in how I feel and how I think my mouth is
Almost everything regarding the Western Caliphate of Al-Andalus, which rivaled the one in Bagdad and had the largest city in Europe at the time, with 1M living in the capital, Corduba
Also some of the important intricacies of the Civil War, like the bullshit "International neutrality" that basically gave Hitler a free pass to test  German weaponry and tactics in Spanish civilians
I've always been fascinated by this period but I have no idea where to start learning about it
Do you have any source or link to learn a bit of what went down
Yeah, that's true
The little medieval Portuguese history I know it's due to historical TV series and Wikipedia rabbit holes
Hmmm
I think we focused more on events that were either directly related to us (that time they invaded us in order to invade you too) or that affected the world on a bigger scale (French revolution, Napoleon, colonialism, WWII; we learn a bit about Portuguese maritime discoveries and the Treaty of Tordesillas too)
But I don't think we learn much medieval French history, at least not that comes to mind
How's the Developer landscape in Finland
Is Finnish a hard requisite
What about education versus work experience
If I ever want to say goodbye to Spain's sun, it'd be a nice place to stay for a while
We abolished capital punishment only in 1978 with the approval of the new constitution, which bans capital punishment except in times of war for military justice
This was just after the end of the dictatorship
As such it was both a vote in the Cortes and by the people, although it was not in normal circumstances
As far as I know there's no one that is seriously considering amending the constitution to allow the State to kill people, but there are crazies everywhere, so probably
EDIT: It is also no longer a punishment in the Military Penal Code, since its reform in 1995, and as such it has been completely abolished in all cases and circumstances
The later ratification of the European Convention of Human Rights means the only way of re-establishing capital punishment in Spain would be to repudiate the Convention and then pass an Organic Law reforming the Military Penal Code, or an amendment to the Constitution, or both
In the Transition to Democracy, in the 70's
The last people executed where members of a basque terrorist group in 1975
Or American
So yeah, what you said
In Spain: Latin American immigrants have the same language, so they adapt easier
Besides, if they stay for just two years legally they can apply for the Spanish nationality
For the rest of the world it's harder but in general I think we are not xenophobic
Yep, they have a hard time unless they're from latin america, those integrate even better than europeans
I always comment that the word expat is a  racist term to differentiate immigrants from poor (usually black or brown) countries from immigrants from wealthy countries
You'd still call an engineer from Brazil that finds a job in Germany an immigrant, so a German engineer that finds s job in Brazil is an immigrant as well, not an expat
I recommend everyone to avoid using the word as much as they can if not eliminating it entirely while being aware of its connotations
I just checked it out of curiosity and apparently it's 2 years for people from former Spanish territories, 5 for refugees and 10 for the rest
It's only one year for other specific cases, like being born here
Source (in Spanish):
Sorry, I should have said Hispanic, I totally overlooked Brazil and French Guyana
Well, most of the Americans I've met  were really nice and they were all people that had traveled around and therefore cool people to spend time with, but there's also the pervasive stereotype of Americans being arrogant, competitive, bigoted, etc
Most Americans that come to Spain are not like that, but you have a bad reputation in general
There's also Trump
Which hasn't improved your reputation much
No, that's the difference between an immigrant and a non-citizen permanent resident
Let's put it that way
Would a Turkish guy be called an expat in Germany or any other rich country despite the time he expects to spend in Germany or the quality of the job he is doing
I don't see it
> países iberoamericanos, Andorra, Filipinas, Guinea Ecuatorial, Portugal o personas de origen sefardí.
No, but EU citizens have practically the same rights as a citizen (healthcare, scholarships, etc
I said "former territories" to sum it up, but it's just this list
Former colonies where Spanish is still spoken would be a better description
I'm not an expert, you'd have to ask a lawyer
The text says that the person would have to reside in Spain for that time in a legal, continued way, immediately before making this request
Maybe in your brother's case it wasn't continuous, maybe the rules were different then, I don't know
I'm an immigrant in the USA
I come from Spain and I came here with a very good contract and I can always come back to Spain
I'm not an expat because I feel no need to differentiate myself from a hard working guy from El Salvador
Not in the country
It is a day off in Madrid, but not because of May 1st, but because May 2nd (local holiday in Madrid) was on Sunday, and was moved to Monday
Rest of the country
no day off
Holidays sometimes “transfer” to Monday when they fall on a Sunday, but not when they fall on a Saturday
Coincidentally, May 2nd is a regional holiday in Madrid and since it fell on a Sunday they transferred it to today
So the region of Madrid does have the day off today
Yes, only holidays that coincide with Sunday are transferable to the following Monday
In some places today is a holiday bcs re held the "Crosses of May" or the "Day of the Cross". For my, its usually a day of reduced working hours (we finish at 12 noon), but as this year can`t be celebrated we have kept the normal work schedule :(
You guys irish are clever
In corona times
Three showers a week at most, sometimes even less, lol
In normal times, every other day, unless it's very warm or I've been to the gym, or something like that
In the summer in Spain, sometimes up to twice a day
Did you mean a shower
I haven’t taken a bath since I was a kid
Most adults in Spain don’t take baths on a regular basis
In fact, many homes have a shower booth instead of a bathtub
If you meant shower, most people in Spain shower once a day
I don’t think it’s common to take more than one shower a day
I personally tend to shower less than that, like every other day, but I don’t know of many people who do same
Once a day seems to be the norm
Daily showers on summer, once every other day the rest of the seasons
I haven't bathed in at least 5 years or so
I take a shower daily, though
in summer every day
And during the winter usually day yes , day no, alternatively
Anybody using the public transport in London or other big cities would have a hard time believing that "most people" shower once a day
In my circles at least everybody seems to shower at least once a day
I sometimes skip a day or "half a day" (as in maybe shower at night today when I showered in the morning yesterday) in winter if I am not being very active and I don't have to go anywhere, and I'd imagine more people do that
But it's also common for some people to shower more than once if they go to the beach or exercise (or anything else that leads to sweating)
Personally I try to make it "fit" my schedule so I would shower at that time anyway
So if I have a rugby practise or I'm going to the gym tomorrow I'll shower tonight before sleeping so I can go through the morning without a shower and I'll take one after the activity
Because I am staying indoors most of the time, so I am barely sweating, I am not getting all the grime and dirt of the city on me as I would when going to the office, and if I do sweat a little bit, nobody has to put up with any odours other than me, and I can tolerate them
Also, my skin is not great, so showering every day is not a great idea, even in normal times
That said, this doesn't mean I don't try to stay as clean as possible
Let me introduce you to the concept of "agüita sobaquera" (hard to translate, the best I can do is "a little armpit wash")
Do you cut the pizza with scissors
Me and other Spaniards got much hate during my Erasmus for cutting the pizza with scissors instead of a pizza cutter
Do you use scissors in your country too or are we the only weirdos
Never heard of it or did it
I usually cut pizza with a knife (I have a cutter that I always misplace just when I need it)
On the other hand, I see absolutely no problem with it
Whatever works for you
Your pizza, your rules
I might even try it next time I eat pizza just to check how it works
I'm Spanish too, and cutting pizza with scissors is the best thing in life
I also got ridiculed by my English friends for doing so
I'll never stop doing it
Yes, always, this is the most practical way to do it, if you don't want to buy a pizza cutter the scissors is the easiest way yo cut it because knife is not easy and effective
Do you cut pizza with scissor
What a psyco xD
I have always seen it cut with a pizza cutter or a knife in the worst case scenario
What part of Spain are you from
As a fellow Spaniard I have to say
yes, of course
Our pizza cutter is dull as a pebble
scissors are way better than a knife
My German ex used to cut the pizza with scissors, too
I knew it is a taboo in Italy, but I didn’t think it would be a problem anywhere else
Yes, I've always done it that way and I didn't know until fairly recently that is not a normal thing outside Spain xD
Yes
We have a pizza cutter at home but I think it's easier and faster to use scissors
My brother and his friends use scissors and it has been said many times it's because they are too incompetent to use a normal cutter or a knife because they smudge the toppings
Yo también soy español y nunca he usado tijeras, lo siento amigo, estás solo en esto
It has never crossed my mind before and I can't see why, cause it sounds rather convenient
I use scissors
They are easy to use, quite fast, they don’t spreads the ingredients as sometimes the pizza cutter does, they are very easy to clean
You can use scissors for more stuff than just pizza so is a more valuable tool
I study in the UK and my housemates FLIPPED when I did it
Scissors are basically a must have when dealing with fish, and we do like our fish
Vegetables
Lol, I've never seen anyone do that, it's not a thing
Pizza, yeah, definitely
Having a kitchen tool that you only use for 1 thing seems silly (that said, I have not one, but two pizza cutters
im one of that people that use scissors for the pizza but i had never heard of cutting vegetables with them
I like your mindset
It's not very good, I think a cutter is much better
But I don't know why, I always use the scissors
i had always used a pizza cutter but when we broke it we just start cutting it with scissors
I have a pizza cutter but when it's not available the next best thing are scissors
Why better than a knife
I didn't expect this answer from an Italian, thanks hahahah That's why I use it, if you have a good pizza cutter is so nice, but if not you just mess up the cheese
The question is why would someone want to have a sharp blade that only cuts one thing
Btw I use whatever I have to cut pizza
Knife, scissors
A pizza cutter makes sense in a pizzeria with many sales because it allows you to cut the pizza very fast, right after the oven without touching it and burning your hands
At home it’s 100% dull
That's the kind of answer I was expecting
I guess because a lot of us don't have a pizza cutter, and if we have one they're so bad that does not cut properly
It's still a discovering if it's independent
I did my Erasmus in Germany and the Germans were the ones who complained more
Ciudad Real, but I've studied in Madrid and many people from different places did the same (most from the south though)
Where are you from
I love how the most annoyed people are not Italian, I didn't expect that
I am indeed an heretic, and a proud one
We use kitchen scissors, like they are no paper scissors, so it is easy to cut
And mostly homemade pizza or cheap shitty one from the supermarkets, in restaurants you get it cut or a pizza cutter
Germans were the more concerned about it during my Erasmus, and Italians in the thread do not seem to care
I'm confused
Hahahahaha we usually have special scissors for the kitchen, so that's not a problem
It's just another cooking tool
Not animals, just uneducated people that don't know the wonderful tools that kitchen scissors are
I think that's the Roman way ("pizza al tagglio")
Can any Italian confirm
I've never seen anyone cutting a lettuce, arugula or any other leafy vegetable without scissors
I use the pizza cutter for the pizza though haha
more demand = more products = more posible to get a bad one  ???
From Granada
Well, I think it was more of an assumption, because all around traditional pizza seems sacred
Not the most Spanish thing, but if it works, it works
An Italian pizza dealer in my neighborhood uses a spatula to cut and serve pizza
Hahahaha sometimes you need somebody to let you know
Best:Trajan for me
Everything from his age is just fantastic, he was a man that put Rome over himself
He was not only an impressive militar but also he made a lot of public infrastructure and overall, he was behind one of the brightest periods of all the Roman history
Honourable mentions to Octavious, Claudius and Marcus Aurelius
Some obscure favourites of me:
- Pertinax: the man had a good spirit and really tried to solve the problems Commodus left behind
I think he could have been a great emperor if it wasn't for his untimely end
- Septimius Severus, but specially Julia Domna: Severus was a great militar, and overall a good emperor
However, it seems like the role that his wife Julia played there was huge
She was a master manipulator and a great politician, and it seems like she really pulled some strings during Severus and Caracalla's time
Some even say that her sister Maesa followed her instructions after dead to establish Heliogabalus as emperor
She certainly was one of the most influential women in History and I think some credit should be given to her
If i remember correctly i would say Trajano due to him be the first for the peninsula and becouse i like the arch of Trajano or the road that was made in spanish called "via trajana" i dont know how this would be called in other languages
Neron
Good speech about what too much power for one person means, and what blind obedience for peasants does
Can't deny I have a soft spot for him and Hadrian indeed
I don't care that much about Theodosius though
Murcia, El Mundo Today won't leave them alone
The Army goes to Murcia to see if people still live there:
He discovers at the age of 20 that he lives in Murcia but his parents hid it from him:
The Government reminds the Spanish who intended to travel to Africa this summer that Murcia is also there:
I feel sorry for Murcia, sometimes
Lepe is the base for jokes of dumb people, tho nowadays most people don't use that kind of jokes
We also have Soria, as completely devoid of people
And Lepe, which IS basically the bottom of all the "how studpid" jokes
An example: why do the police Cars in Lepe have a bathtub
>!to Carry the siren
But Lepe is the classic one
>I feel sorry for Murcia, sometimes
Then i remember they voted for VOX and It goes away
Murcia doesn't even exist, it's a conspiracy made up by our government
Then there's Teruel, they even have a political party called Teruel Exists lmao
For sure Murcia, but I would say Galicia gets their part too
Im from Murcia
Can confirm
All my friends outside murcia mock us because of that
If only they knew we have the best gastronomy of the country and one of the most healty lifestyles
Acho pijo
Tbf not all of us voted for it
Actually Im from a town that voted mostly for the PSOE
As a murcian I can only say I wish
I was looking for *this* comment
I understand
I come from a town so right wing i was praying for the PP to beat VOX (Podemos didn't even bother putting up posters
I'm from Madrid, just sayin'
Im so scared of the rising of the alt right
Well, at least its not growing as fast as before
Madrid
I mean, the vast majority of Spanish media is recorded or shot in Madrid
Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia
Madrid and Barcelona's metropolitan areas are roughly the same size, 5-6 million inhabitants (although Madrid city's population is the twice of Barcelona)
Valencia is far smaller with around 1,5 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area
Both Valencia an Barcelona are located in the Mediterranean coast and have both Spanish and Catalan/Valencian as their languages, while Madrid is monolingual and located in the middle of the Spanish plateau
Madrid is a big city
Good place to live but that's it
Its the capital so it has some good museums but not much else
Barcelona is a tourist city
Prices are high and its one of the most unsafe cities in Spain (its not really unsafe, but pickpocketing is rampant)
People used to just leave the city and live somewhere far from the tourists
Valencia combines the best of the two
Not very touristy but it's full of amazing stuff and it's one of the best places to live
People come for the experience, food, and nightlife
Madrid and Barcelona are good places as well bit I've never been to Madrid and I was a tourist in Barcelona so I don't really know much
I'm also a bit biased since I'm from Valencia so take it with a grain of salt
Hmm
I always thought Bilbao would be the third biggest
Actuallly, it's the sixth in size of its metropolitan area ([
In Spain there is a 95% vaccinated rate for children below 2 so experts say obligatory vaccines are not necessary
If there is a break of measles in a zone with low vaccination rate a judge could order the people to take the vaccines
Are you talking about the judge thing
It's not a region, it's a zone
I guess the translation would be a District (barrio in Spanish), two streets and the people infected would be like 20
I think that having a two thousand  people vaccinated would be better than none but I guess there was no hope for then to not get sick
Yeah they are usually translated
Yes, in spanish they all change and the Pope also
Prince William and his wife Kate are el príncipe Guillermo and Catalina de Cambridge
But king Harald of Norway is still Harald, and i don't know why
Maybe it's because they didn't know how to translate it, or it isn't a christian/latin name
I was blown away by how cool, architecturally and culturally diverse, and geographically gorgeous Sarajevo is
Definitely one of the best kept secrets in Europe, and the fact that it was absolutely leveled during my lifetime seems more relatable than visiting other European cities that may have faced similar issues 60 years before I was born
It's absolutely astounding that the city was able to bounce back so quickly
I also had a magnificent time in Romania
Bucharest is a bit boring, but Brasov and Sinaia are such  picturesque little towns, and the mountainous landscape around Transylvania is truly breathtaking
Southern Russia seems nice, the caucasus and all that
And northern spain is criminally underrated
Agreed
Went there last October-November and I really enjoyed the experience
Brașov, the Carpathian mountains and Transylvania are amongst my favourite places in the world now
I visited Bratislava in 2011 and was not so impressed
I have friends who went back in 2016 and raved about how nice of a place it was
I have not yet made it back there but plan to sometime soon
Was there a lot of improvements going on in recent years
I've only been to Saint Petersburg, but I can confirm it's breathtaking, definitely the most beautiful city (in architectural terms) I've visited
Asturias has great landscapes, and you can visit the [roman remains of Lugo]  or the medieval part of [Santiago] near the Cathedral
Theres also the [Cies Islands] wich are probably the cleanest in Europe, and a natural reserve open to the public
Most beaches in northern spain are pretty clean anyway
thanks to the lack of mass tourism
Thanks for the info
I'm definitely more about the vibe and environment while traveling, I've seen more old churches and statues than I care to think about
I'll definitely check it out soon :)
Will do
Thank God you said what it was, I thought they were stating their age, and was trying too hard to figure out why was that relevant at all
Language: Basque       Band: Berri Txarrak   Song: [Bueltatzen]
Band: Kalakan/Orekatx   Song: [Harria Herria]
Language: Valencian   Band: Obrint Pas  Song: [Flama]
Language: Asturianu   Band: Desakato    Song: [N'alcordanza]
There is a variety of traditional instruments in Spain, along with a variety of languages
Could you share the playlist once finished
It would be great
BTW, my suggestion would be Fiesta Pagana, from Mago de Oz
[Extremoduro - La Vereda De La Puerta De Atrás] Their album La Ley Innata is amazing too, the best Spanish rock album I've heard
Oooh boy, I have two favorite rock groups [Extremoduro] , [another extremoduro song] , [another one] [Marea] [another one of marea] also [La fuga]
There are lot of groups but my favorite is Extremoduro (30+ years playing music) there are a lot of kind of songs, more punk, more relaxed, etc
If you like Extremoduro I recommend you to hear "La ley innata" this album is brutally good, lot of changes in the music which make it unique
I still hearing this group and it is amazing, if you like it and wants some recommendation you can ask me ;)
Also in the spanish rock the bass is incredible
My girlfriend likes this one
[Medina Azahara - Córdoba]
Very southern, with flamenco touches
[Another northern one] just for balance
I would like to add Salduie
Very underapreciated one
In Spain to invest in marketing is not a priority, usually
[DESCARNATIO - SALDUIE]
&#x200B;
very good band
Very nice band
I would also add [Ayreon]
I really like that band
This two voices play is amazing
Woodan Herst is for me, still the best
I don't know what this voices have
As for metal, I would recommend [Fiesta Pagana by Magö de Oz] It is a classic of folk metal in Spain; it's so popular even people who are not into metal know this song and it's played in a lot of parties because of its lyrics about the working-class people fighting against its oppressors
But most importantly, it features traditional instruments (mostly from the North) of Spain, such as the Spanish guitar, the bagpipe, the flute and the accordion
And it's catchy af
I like your style
If I may add some more:
* [Extremoduro - stand by]
* [Los Suaves - Dolores se llamaba Lola]
You are welcome;)
came here to mention Los Suaves
Charles II had a whole list of mental issues, but in his favour he didn't do anything actually insane and instead let his regents to reestabilize the already decadent empire as well as they could, which was a nice change of pace after being at war with everyone under his father Philip IV
On the other hand his successor Philip V, on addition of being french saw his mental health quickly deteriorating as he got older, suffering from some kind of chronic manic depression
He knew about it and abdicated in his son Louis, but he had the impoliteness of dying in a month and the increadingly nutty old man had to go back
He spent a good deal of his late reign bedridden, where he spent his days refusing to change clothes, living among the filth, screaming, biting courtesans and trying to escape, while the Queen took charge of the state affairs
Ferdinand VI apparently attacked his visitors due to dementia, and Charles II was extremelly inbred
>\[Charles\] suffered ill-health and has been described as "short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely  bald before 35, always on the verge of death but repeatedly baffling  Christendom by continuing to live
[Rest in piece sweet prince
Ferdinand the 7th
Franco Basically
He ruined the republic, made a fascist regime, banned local cultures and languages and forced Castilian traditions on all
*Sigh*, if they only knew cities skylines back in the day
Dollfuss looks pretty much like a Doofus
To think we had Juana “la loca” (the mad) and she probably wouldn’t make it into my top 3
Inbreeding is a terrible thing indeed
Well, we will see how you do with Bolsonaro
I had no idea that was Ferdinad Vi
Don't you mean Philip V?
Hey let's name the son of the King of England the heir to the throne of France, that makes perfect sense
Castilian traditions my ass
Look at the promotion of Andalusian coplas and bullfighting during the nadir of the 1940s and 1950s. Is that Castilian
Franco was a greedy sociopath, a small man complex, a meapilas, a neomedievalist, a British stereotype of a Spaniard, a totalitarian asshole, an antiintellectual, but he was in no way a Castilian nationalist and it is a shame that younger Spaniards seem to be absorving this foreign mischaracterization that pretends to equate Spain with Yugoslavia and Castile with Serbia
Castillian
How many *sevillana* dresses have you seen people wear in Castilla
How many times have you seen a *flamenco* show there
Both Philip V and Ferdinand VI had mental issues apparently
Henry VIII got the jackpot then
TIL thank you
I never looked deep into him so I sort if assumed he was like, okay
At least he didn't fuck up big time like others
The most famous one has to be the trial of Madrid bombing terrorists, presided over by judge Javier Gómez Bermúdez
Other notorious cases are:
- Gürtel case
A corruption case affecting the Popular Party to an enormous scale
It has been divided into a lot of separate cases due to its own enormity
- Bárcenas case
A spin-off of Gürtel
Bárcenas was the treasurer of the Popular Party for a lot of years, and he organised a whole system of money laundering in order to launder the money coming from bribes, which he later distributed in cash among the top officers of the party
- Filesa
A corruption case affecting the Socialist Party in the 1980s.
- GAL
The socialist government in the 1980s organised the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación, a state-sponsored terrorist group targeting the members of the Basque separatist terrorist group ETA
- "Procès" case
The members of the Catalan government from 2017 and the presidents of Òmnium and Assemblea Nacional Catalana were tried for their attempt at Catalan secession
They were sentenced to 9-12 years in prison for sedition in medial joinder with aggravated malversation of public funds
- Rocío Waningkopf (not sure on the actual orthography) case
Said girl was murdered in the 1990s, and the case became a very notable one against the whole concept of the jury
The woman found guilty by the jury was actually innocent, and it was quite evident that the public opinion, and the jury, had been prejudiced against her for being a lesbian
The José Bretón case, a father who burned alive his son and daughter as a revenge to his ex-wife
Good examples
I would also add Nagore Lafarge case, Spain vs Franco family for "Pazo de Meiras" and the "La Manada" one
What I find more interesting is cases involving interesting legalities (opinions, decisions etc
) more than just a case becoming famous because the public wanted a different verdict or a case determining the fate of a party in elections
Uh, that's a trend the US started and it's linguistically very annoying
The German approach is one I like though: inclusion by, essentially, including women through feminine acknowledgement
Rather than dismissing gender as irrelevant and trying to bury it away
Oh, don't get me started
That's probably the worst
1) It's unpronouncable 2) It was made in the US and is popularized in English, which means it leaves behind the way actual Spanish speakers speak 3) it's based on Latino, which isn't a great term anyways 4) it assumes recognizing gender is inherently bad, and thus eliminates recognition of women through feminine words 5) it goes against cultural and linguistic heritage 6) most Spanish speakers don't use it, don't want it, don't identify with it, and many outright hate it
7) it serves little purprose, since 'Hispanic' is gender neutral anyways, and most Spanish speakers prefer it (or 'Spanish' where applicable)
Well that's certainly a TIL
I can see the logic, and it seems reasonable enough to treat the safety net as a 'rainy day fund' if that's what voters want
Just not something I expected to see
We don't, the common phrase for "thank you" is simply "gracias" and that's it
But you can also say "we lo agradezco" (I thank you) o "se lo agradecemos" (We thank you) but it sounds formal and it's not that common on the day to day
We should also point out that if we want to be very specific we can say "Gracias a tí" (singular) and "Gracias a vosotros" (plural), which is a bit formal but not uncommon
I don't think there is a general rule for the whole country, it will depend more on each teacher
In my case the general rule was that we read at least two books per term, we chose which book and when we finished we had to make an oral summary for the teacher, because in the written essays it is easier to make a copy and paste from the internet
That was the norm for all four years of high school (12y-16y or so), but in the last two years we did have some required books
* Don Quijote, Cervantes
The summarized version adapted to current Spanish, a piece of shit
* Lazarillo de Tormes, Anonymous
* Platero y yo, Juan Ramón Jiménez (poetry)
* Legends, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer
* Meow, Benito Pérez Galdós.
* La Celestina, Fernando de Rojas
* The House of Bernarda Alba, Federico García Lorca (theatre)
Those are the ones I can remember
I was also forced to read Le Petit Prince, but in philosophy class, not literature
I think it was the only mandatory foreign book
Don Quixote, the song of Mio Cid, Lazararillo de Tormes
There were more, but these are the only ones i remember
There are no mandatory books, simply each teacher choose the books the class must read
I had to read two books by Galdós on the same year
I'm a bookworm but man, just couldn't finish either (Marianela and Trafalgar)
Also had to read La Celestina that same year, in ancient Castillian
It was a fucking nightmare
There are rules that apply to the whole country, with some variations depending on the region
Why did you read a summarised version of El Quijote AND in modern Spanish
Were you in a "special" class of some kind
Lol
God, Tirant lo Blanc was a torture, I was an avid reader back then and it was the first book I really had problems reading
I remember also reading Mirall Trencat and Nada during Bachillerato
They change the curriculum every few years
I guess my teacher, who was one of my favourite teachers and was really involved in encouraging reading and helping us to find genres and books that we really loved, opted for that version bcs he dont want yo spend the whole year with one book
In general, El Quijote in old Spanish is not very attractive when you are 14 years old
In retrospect, I don't think I would have enjoyed reading it out of obligation as a teenager as much as I enjoyed reading it a few years later, nor would I have appreciated its descriptions and humor (I laughed a lot reading it)
I think if I had been forced to read it, I would have hated it as much as I hated all the others
I guess that makes sense
But I still can't help feeling that simplifying it to the point of not even reading it in Old Spanish is dumbing it down too much
Maybe they could try making us read selected episodes, rather than the whole book
In any case, if your teacher's strategy did encourage people to read, that's always a good thing
Excluding basic stuff / things I actually need:
STUFF I USE A LOT:
- My computer
I spend 12h+ every day on the computer, both for work and free time
- My tablet
I don't use it much in daily life, but it's pretty basic while travelling
I travel sans-internet so I have all the screenshots of maps I need, all the information about places, transportation, I send emails to family, etc
In daily life I also use it as an ereader
- My camera
For travel, but I also have a youtube channel, so I use it every week for that + side projects every now and then
STUFF I LIKE:
- A vertical computer mouse
It does wonders for avioding carpal tunnel syndrome
- My pillow + blanket
I have x4 pillows (I typically only sleep with x2, one for the head, one for the hugging, but sometimes I go for 3-4) and multiple layers of blankets
I like to be as comfortable as possible when sleeping and take my bed very seriously
It's heaven
STUFF I DON'T USE, BUT I WOULD BE SAD TO LOSE:
- My teddies
- A daruma doll
The idea with daruma dolls is that they have empty white eyes, you're supposed to draw one of the eyes and ask for a wish and then draw the other one when the wish comes true
The problem is that I bought the doll when I had depression and I wished that I would "feel safe one day". It was 3 years later until I actually got over the constant sense of dread and would've been able to draw in the second eye
But I decided to leave it empty
Seeing the empty eye serves as a reminder that even if things might be bad one day, they can improve
I will add the rest when I think of them
Internet access is considered a basic right, so I only need a (good) PC
&#x200B;
I am a very basic person with no special needs
My computer, my phone (I don't like it that much, but I'd have to stay in communication with family and friends), a yoga mat, a good book worth reading more than once, pencils and drawing paper
I'm struggling to think of anything more, I guess I don't need that much to keep myself entertained
If it was a short trip or I wouldn't be able to stay for too long in each part of the itinerary, then just clothes, money and the basic stuff (toothbrush, etc
Excluding basic things like food and water
Pen/pencil and paper (notes, drawings, etc)
A camera
A musical instrument (can be small)
Phone + earphones
Multi tool knife
My laptop, I make a living off it
Cigarettes
Toothpaste and toothbrush
A great book or books
Beer
1/Phone+charger~who doesn't? It can do almost everything
The most radical change in travel in the last 20 years might have been the Phone
It has changed everything, from how you move, to how you inform yourself
2/mountain Boots~one of my musts when traveling, i walk quite a lot and anything else gets worn down rather fast
3/raincoat~i'm very much coldblooded so a good raincoat IS a must
4/backpack~ selfexplicatory
5/headphones+earphones~ apart from listening to music, they come in handy while traveling, want to set an alarm without waking everyone Up, just put your earphones before going to sleep
6/soap~travel essential
Small, increadibly usefull and It lasts for decades
7/Notebook+pencil~ i scribble on and about everything, i've finished theorem proofs on toilet paper because i had nothing else, so it's pretty much a necessity
8/wallet~ i'm pretty forgetfull so having an ordered set of things is important to me, my Wallet IS the first of them, It has almost everything i need on the day to day and all my attention IS focused on It
Of course while in travel i store the most important documents elsewhere
I don't like having a phone either, ideally I'd not have one but it's pretty hard to forego it altogether (for communicating with coworkers in tech emergency situations, having a bank account, etc
, that sort of thing)
I recently switched from movistar to simyo though, I pay 2€/month for calls and basic internet and I'm glad that I don't have to put more money into something I don't even want or use
I'm trying to think whether I can abandon it when I move to New Zealand
I looked it up and I don't find them very cute, even with the eyes painted on
Here are some [daruma dolls]
I personally use *Realpolitik* somewhat often, but it's not like it's a common word in Spanish
I can't think of a German word that we use regularly
I can think of a couple of words of German origins, partially adapted to Spanish, like "delicatessen" or "leitmotiv".
> Regarding English loan words in German there is a very paradox phenomenon of "fake-English". German basically invents English words or just misuses them, a very famous example is the word "handy" for mobile phone
We have that too
For example, for some reason, instead of jogging we say "footing".
>Regarding English loan words in German there is a very paradox  phenomenon of "fake-English". German basically invents English words or  just misuses them, a very famous example is the word "handy" for mobile  phone
We also do that by adding -ing
For a really long time everyone said "footing" instead of running
About loan words from German, we have a few, although not as many as from French or English or Greek: leitmotiv, obús, zepelín, vals, hamburguesa, cuarzo, delicatessen, hámster, búnker, zeitgeist, etc
We do also have many words that come from ancient Germanic languages, mainly Gothic because of the Visigoths, but those aren't really that related to modern German
Coche (car) came from german i think
we have a lot of visigothic words like yelmo, guardia, guerra, tapa
Hámster, hamburguesa, vals, cuarzo o feldespato are also *germanismos*
lol same, we have some secret special words, you don't know but the grammar is cool though
In Spain it's socially acceptable and it has become pretty common these days
For example, our Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Rights Pablo Iglesias used to wear a ponytail, but nowadays he wear a bun
Many people often make jokes about his hairstyle, but it's more about political issues than esthetic
Fairly common in young people
Not the best imagte you want if you work in a high status place, to be honest
My hair used to be long, and the only problems I had were with my parents
Spanish 2nd vice president
(Yes there are 3 vice presidents-PM
Only hipsters and heavy metal people uses it in Spain
Just far right people make fun of it, most people just don't care
Even my brother in law has really long hair
Yes but usually they wear it tied up in a bun or a ponytail, at least from what I've seen, or a hair band
Oh no, it's not
I had to cut my hair to find a job some years ago
That is serious
It also happened that walking in the streets I suffered life threats from skin heads
Spain is no tolerant with it, unless you are a Roma Gallardo or some bullshit maleist in the right wing
I'm not sure it's socially acceptable or common quite the way you phrase it
In fact, I'd consider it specifically uncommon, and something that you'd mostly find among certain categories of generally younger people
Not that those people would see themselves particularly affected, as their social circles probably wouldn't mind it, but it's still not something that would be appropriate everywhere in Spain in all contexts, and especially not one that's common across the board
On the other hand, we Spanish women tend to tear out hair down most of the time
If it's too hot or exercising I will tie it up, but otherwise
\- Mantis
\- Mantis religiosa
\- Santa Teresita (Little Saint Theresa)
Similar in Spain, they’re called "mantis religiosa" (Religious Mantis)
In spanish
How = Como
And the question in spanish is
¿Como le llamais a x...?
Literally "How do you call x...?
"Mantis religiosa" in Spanish
I would say that the most famous Spanish song is [Gran Vals] by Francisco de Tárrega even thought most people who hear it don't know it is it
And there was a dark time when [this song] was an international hit
I knew it in the 90s as an antifascist theme, covered (translated and adapted) by a Spanish left-wing rock band called Boikot
However they named the song after the Spanish civil war republican side slogan "[No pasarán] (They shall not pass) and mixed with a popular republican song after the civil war [siege of Madrid]
Most people knew it was an adaptation
For those who didn't get it or didn't click the link, [the famous Nokia cellphones ringtone is an excerpt from Gran Vals by Francisco de Tárrega]
Los Pajaritos is an Spanish adaptation from Der Ententanz by Werner Thomas composed in 1957
I woulnd't say is a Spanish song since it was translated in many languages
For locals, I'd say [Paquito el Chocolatero] by Gustavo Pascual Falcó is one of the most popular folk songs in Spain since the 30's. [Here] you can see a whole stadium singing it in a soccer match
[Rosalía] is pretty famous right now too
Wasn't she the first singer to win a Grammy without singing in English or something like that
Nope, they "sing" in spanish (kind of) but they're French
That's Puerto Rican, not Spanish
That we have a lisp, that we are moors and that we are mexicans
That we are lazy and we are thieves and we don't like to work
That we listen to Lola Flores and dance flamenco all day
That all of us sleep from 14:00 to 17:00
When someone asks if you've ever seen snow or they don't actually know there are 4 seasons here, too
That we are lazy
Whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night
This is a very widespread thought in Spain and I hate it
All the Romanians I know are really nice and hardworking  people
But definitely, leaving food on a plate is way worse
Also, assuming we are an underdeveloped, violent country because wE sPeAk MeXiCaN when we got a higher HDI than Italy and France and our crime rate is amongst the lowest in Europe
Just be careful when you use the balcony ok
Terrorists jokes are a thing also in Spain with the Basque Country
You do isn't? Iran is a Middle East country and a Islamic Republic so
I didn't know I was romanian
pero esos son todos ciertos
ademas i think thats a spanish way of thinking
europe doesnt understand why we would be thieves or lazy or about lola flores (fuck idek who she is) the flamenco and nap part maybe and also that we have a lisp
This and Fichtl's lied are the reason why I don't trust German music
That's true but northern Spain has some cold winters
Mediterranean cities are way warmer but that happens in France, Italy, Greece
This winter has been warm so far, thou
It hasn't rained as much as it should, there hasn't been snow yet, but I think that's a trend through all Europe
The earth is getting warmer
Ciertamente en el norte creo que no, de otros sitios no puedo opinar porque no he estado lo suficiente en el sur
But you got some people from other UE countries or USA and it's like they watched all the Torrente movies before coming here and they think that's how it is you know
I was once asked if Canadians live underground because of the cold
I heard people from the north of Spain saying that Africa starts in the Ebro, so I guess it is similar
Thanks
Have a good day
Andalucians freak out if it dips below 10°C so I believe it
I know
I live in Málaga
Estás confundiendo vagancia con vaguedad/imprecisión...
Rewarded and protected for as long as you can foresee
The descendants of some of them are still in charge
Business, banking, politics, etc
Also they won the Spanish Civil War
They were proud, at least until 1975
Well,.. It's complicated
Free holidays
This shit is so frustrating
sigh
Believe it or not, we have no one better than the King to become the President of the Republic
It's a drama
Yes but no
Well lets say:
1939-1975 Considered heroes that fought against communists
1975-2004 Well, it was war, kind of neutral
2004-Now Not proud of participating in that war
I'd rather have Mr Borbon as an elected president than as a king
Even then, I don't buy into that
El Preparao isn't the only person capable of doing the job
And maybe we shouldn't trust that much someone whose family (his sister, his brother in law and his own father) has already been involved in corruption
No, thank you
How's your Spanish
Ok, how about Aznar
Rajoy, maybe
Díaz Ayuso
Rodrigo Rato
Espe Aguirre
Jordi Pujol
Xavier Arzalluz
Arnaldo Otegi
Let's hope for the new generation of politicians, but by now, no one in Spain is able to be President of the Republic
First of all, it depends on the type of republic
Presidential (US), semi-presidential (France) or parliamentary (Germany)
In the first two, the president is political and the head of government, so it would be whoever wins the elections
They're systems that work so I don't think we should dismiss them that quickly
If an hypothetical Spanidh republic was of the third type, I'd look into former presidents of the Congress who have done a good job and showed they can mediate the democratic process
I'm the opposite of a PP supporter, but Ana Pastor did a respectable job
I don't know about the previous ones because I didn't pay that much attention to politics back then
We should also consider independent candidates coming from the intellectual spheres, that could serve as a compromise among parties of different ideologies
[Spanish
Ana Pastor plays the moderate game and in the meantime belongs to Opus Dei
Ehmm
That's the opposite of my point
She might have whatever ideology she has, but that didn't condition her job
She's also friends with a gay Catalan nationalist former *conseller* and attended his wedding so she might not be s conservative as you think, but that's besides the point
Hmmm
They are equals
Some have as much level of independency or more as Switzerland
Some have their co-official languages which have been protected and promoted with the constitutional voting and subsequent national budgets
The main reason you and I are speaking in English right now is because we want to be understood by a broad audience
Following that same rule, in English, saying “castillian” is meaningless unless you are talking to a specific subset of people that actually know what it means (although I guess you could go around saying Spain-Spanish, but then we are back to square 1)
“Spanish” is in the curious position that no matter what you do, it’s problematic
If you call it Castillian, LatAm probably won’t like that (they sure as hell don’t speak Castillian, they speak Argentinian Spanish, or Mexican Spanish, or
), but if you call it Spanish, we are “discriminating our regional languages”. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
I personally, in general, use “Spanish” while speaking in English, and castellano in Spanish, unless I’m specifically talking about the dialect of Castille, or talking about the language as a whole, respectively
Spain is aconfessional
To be clear
The ones in charge of deciding if a language is ‘valid’ or not is said language’s containing territory
The only one who can decide if Estremeñu is a valid language to be taught in schools is not the central government, but Extremadura itself
The government’s official position is essentially “Castillian is the common language
Learn it
***However*** if a region considers a language important, then it is equally important as Spanish throughout that region
Learn it too
” (There might be a ‘bit’ of paraphrasing over there)
E: Something that’s not 100% clear to me is if enough people in, let’s say Murcia, speak Ionian Greek,  and wanted to make it an official language there, if they *could*
So what
That has nothing to do with the conversation
What would be the problem then
I am not for killing languages or cultural heritages except when they are against of the UDofHR or suppose a risk for future clean, air, soil and water resources
Animal's rights are strönk in me too
I wouldn't trust a member of Opus Dei as a President of the Republic, that person is not suitable for the job
> What would be the problem then
None
I’m just reiterating that, when it comes to languages, the one to blame for a language being “second-classed” is not the state
>  am not for killing languages or cultural heritages ***except***
I can’t think of any good reason to forcibly kill a language
If you relocate a population, the people should still be allowed to speak their original language, at the very least, amongst themselves
(*can* a language go against the udohr
Heritage
I’d rather not have an opinion xD (there are too many asterisks
A president of the Republic in this case would have no more power than the king does nowadays
They would only be figureheads that call for the closure of congress and new elections, presents a candidate for the president of the government after meeting with all parties, etc
Pastor being a member of Opus Dei didn't stop her from doing a good job as a president of Congress, why would it stop her now
Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't vote for her nor support her in any way, but she would be a respectable conservative candidate for the position as opposed to people like Casado or Ayuso
I sense we both agree if we exclude mu clumsy use of English
That's the key, there's no one respectable right now
Maybe Errejón.
Lots of them
I live in s region named Castile
Lots of them
Most castles in Spain are in ruins, but they have their charm and there's plenty
Well, I’m not really sure, but I’d say around 8-10 castles, between Spain, Romania and Italy
Pfff
Who knows
About 30 abroad, and 50+ here in spain
Probably more
We're plagued with castles and i for one LOVE them
If i had to count the ones i've seen It would be well over the 200
You just can't Drive across Spain without seeing a Castle
Every time i go up north i see a couple dozen
This IS wahta happened:
I read the question
I say out loud: Who would ask tha
HE'S AMERICAN RIGHT
Ok, he's American
There are two (massive) regions in Spain with a name that starts with "Castilla" (Castilla la Mancha and Castilla y León), which basically means they used to be full of castles during the reconquering of Spain, while the Christians in the north were fighting the caliphate of the south
They used to put castles everywhere to hold the land they were conquering
I'm guessing it was the same in Portugal
The only ones I remember are *murciélago* (bat) and *estadounidense* (citizen of the USA), but they're not really that short, there's probably a shorter one
There's "euforia" as well
Acuífero (aquifer
) is the first one that comes to my mind right after murciélago
Secuoia, the tree
But it's usual to write it as secuoyas
Acuífero is another one
There are two definitions of the word vowel
The ortographic one (letters) and the phonetic one (sounds)
I think in this discussion they are talking about letters
And "abuelito" (granddaddy), which I guess is cheating a bit as it's a derived word
I'm surprised I hadn't "euforia" ready, the rest I knew since childhood
And it's a favorite song
Secuoia doesn't appear on the RAE, so I guess that one doesn't count
I had a look online and there are tens of thousands of words with all 5 vowels in Spanish, but it seems that euforia is one of the shortest
As I told you, there are two definitions for vowel
You can find both in dictionaries
Is random drunk singing in buses normal in other european countries
When I went out to party in Spain we took a midnight bus that was absolutly packed of people also going to the party, and everyone was singing in unison random local songs (They sang queen at some point though) These people didn't know each other at all, they were just drunk
Does this tend to hapen in other places
That’s almost tradition in Spanish parties
Unless we are bothering people, of course
We trynna keep it civil
I think Spanish and Spanish speaking Latin Americans can understand both of us perfectly
Maybe some word may still be used there and here isn't and vice versa
But the difference is not too big
Maybe some really deep rural accent can be difficult to understand, but that's more rare to happen
Chilean is a bit difficult to understand sometimes but if they are in a casual / vulgar talk, they speak extremely fast and use some strange vocabulary sometimes
Even if we understand us, the differences in pronunciation and a bit in vocabulary makes us have two dubs, one for Latin America and one for Spain
Spanish from very rural areas of south american countries are a nightmare
But in spanish we share the RAE (royal spanish academy) which is an organization (one on each spanish speaking country) that comes together to make the dictionary and the rules of spanish, so if the speaker is educated enough (highschool educated) we understand without any problems
I wouldn't call it difficulties but when you travel to latin America there are some words or expressions that you either don't understand or have a different meaning
But its maybe 1 out of 30 words so you often understand by context or in 2 or 3 days you get used to those words
For example, coger in Spain is to pick up, in latam is to fuck, pararse in Spain is to stop, in latam is to get up
Sometimes yes for Spaniards, mostly Chilean people, but for example I have a friend from Perú
It's not just for Latin American, we sometimes don't understand people from other regions of our same country
Nah we understand each other in a 95%. A few words are different but nothing very important
Only if they have a really strong accent, but I usually don't.
Normally, no, although at first there might be a few words you can't understand
However for some more extreme accents (from example people from some small village) it can be harder
That said it can also be hard to understand Spaniards from certain areas with strong accents
I can't understand a few words of Chicano english and Mexican spanish since they're mexican slang but thats it, 99% of the words are the same and vowel phonetics dont change
Generally we understand them perfectly except for some vocabulary, but some dialects like the Caribbean ones (Puerto Rico, Rep Dominicana and Cuba) can be hard if you aren't used to them because of the accent and how fast they speak
I think Chilean being impossible to understand is kind of a meme because at least I personally can understand it
Then again, the same thing can be said about some dialects in Spain from some places of Andalusia
Not really, as a spaniard i can understand every latin quite easily
Obviously some idiomatic expressions are quite difficult, but i can mantain a fluent conversation with them :)
Only to add, that as I’m familiar with some local vocabulary in South America my only trouble would be when there is a Quechua or Mayan speaker that really doesn’t speak Spanish very well and their grammar and pronunciation is very dubious
That would happen if you go to parts of Guatemala, Bolivia, Perú.
Also, street slang from Mexico City in slums would be also difficult, but I guess it would be even difficult for Mexicans themselves
It is said that the accent from Murcia is impossible to understand
Lucky Murcia doesn’t exist
They have a very conservative dialect from Western France
It might be right to some extent and they protect French against English vocabulary while French in France has quite a lot
Like in France they would say le week-end and in Québec  they say fin de semaine
Venezuelan is easy in my opinion
Difficult ones are rural Chilean or some Caribbean speakers
Not really
As i said, every rural/isolated accent/dialect is hard
Educated people normally use similar words (as we all use the same dictionary/rules)
Venezuelan is extremly similar to the canarian accent for me, not very difficult
The RAE is not controlled by Spain
There is one in every spanish speaking country and they come together to make the dictionary and rules bases on how it is actually being spoken and used
That's the beauty of spanish
The original and oldest is in spain
What i mean is that tyey are not goverment officials
They choose their memebers and fund theirselves (via donations and dictionaries and books, etc)
Sin problema
La conjugación de vos es muy sencilla
Solo hay algunas expresiones o palabras específicas que a lo mejor me despistan
He visto muchas películas argentinas como siete reinas y no tienen dificultad
Very bueno
For Spain, I think either the Civil War (1936-1939) or the Transición (the restoration of democracy after the dicator's passing in 1975)
In my opinionare almost all major events since 1898 with cuba, puerto rico and filipinas + second republic + civil war + dictatorship + transicion democratica
i will say that first republic would be the one, that sets the infighting of the parites and the political turmoil that makes the 19 and 20 century a political turmoil that creates the situation for the civil war
well that model the spanish mentality from the 16 century to the 19 century but that mentality has litle to do with the actual one,
I don't think so, Civil War and the Transición are what really define the Spanish national identity
Nothing related to America
I'd rather say the conquest of America, and later for modern Spain the Civil War
Add in the Peninsular War too as a fundamental step in between
I wouldn't say the Reconquista has much importance in the actual national identity
It had its importante as America's discovery and the many wars we fought but those aren't present in most people from Spain today, Spanish Civil War, its legacy and the fear to a new civil war is mcuh more present
Paella, I can't deal with it
I like to eat rice
but *that*? No, sir
That's not my thing
Nothing, i hardly hate any food
If it's well cooked i like It
I love trying new foods so i've just gotten used to different flavours and textures
I think the shock of the new plays a central part on why people don't like certain foods
They make you feel uncomfortable and so you hate them
My experience has led me to believe that if you make an effort most food can be an acquired taste
I used to hate avocado, canned tuna and raw fish but with time i got over It and now i love the three of them
My brother over here hates salmorejo
It's similar to gazpacho, but thicker
For me, it's callos
And snails, for fuck sake
Te entiendo demasiado
Además que es la comida social comodín y nadie la sabe hacer que no sea un infierno de mover tropezones
How could you betray us like this bröther
Nooooo, how could you say smth so cruel
I lived a year in Ireland
they know there's other ways to prepare vegetables, right
You don't need to boil them till they fall appart
Estais locos, la paella bien echa es un must de los domingos
Aunque obviamente al ser valenciana juego con ventaja jajaja
I'm not joking if I tell you that if you live in France, Italy or Spain, being a picky eater is a legit reason to be an outcast
You're right, but many people don't like It, don't know why
Es que es eso: bien hecha
Y casi todo el que conozco es un montón de cosas sobre arroz amarillo
Happy cake day
I still shudder when i remember mushy boiled turnip
Grill or oven, both are delicious
Here we have a few dishes that just consist on that escalivada and pimientos del padrón for example
Wtf it isn't rare we do it in Spain and I think that also in Latin America
Exactly the same in Spain
Indoors or on the street
If the latter, same disgusting shit here
Not common but not that uncommon either, unfortunately
I read once about this sacred "personal space" between dudes
Picture the scenario where you're sitting on the couch with your friends, and there's not much room
Your legs are touching, right
Well, apparently American guys would think that's weird and would try to always keep a miniscule gap between their bodies
I read this in Reddit so it may be total bullshit
It's definitely a thing in Spain
I mean, if I don't have any tissues to throw up the snot I accumulated in my throat I'm going to spit it out
It may be disgusting but I'm not going to swallow that shit
It seems it is normal in France to kiss everybody everyday
- Madrid: [Museo del Prado]  [Reina Sofía]  and [Thyssen-Bornemisza]
- Bilbao: [Guggenheim]
- Valencia: [Ciudad de las artes y las ciencias]
- Figueres (Girona): [Museo Dalí]
- Barcelona: [MACBA]
- Málaga: [Pompidou centre]
- Murcia: [Salzillo museum]
Among many others, but I'd say these are some of the most famous (except for Salzillo museum which is not that well known
It's mainly Semana Santa sculpture from one of the greatest artisans, Francisco Salzillo)
[Arcade Vintage Museum] in Ibi (Ailcante) Spain
I can say 4 in Madrid: El Prado, el Thyssen, el Reina Sofía and MAN (Museo Arqueológico Nacional)
Never go to the Museo de Cera de Madrid unless you want to laugh
The Imperial War Museum, the HMS Belfast, National Gallery and the Natural History Museum are all amazing, and most of them really close to the British Museum
IMHO the amount and quality of museums is one of the things that amazed me the most as a tourist in London
While the Guggenheim Museum has been the iconic museum of Bilbao since its opening
The Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao (Bilbao Fine Arts Museum) is a jewel that I always recommend
I can't believe you forgot the [MAN]
Yesss
It's collection is small but so good
I mostly agree with you
The building is very unique
And as I said, it has become iconic and attracted many visitors to Bilbao
That has been quite good for the city (trust me, Bilbao did not look the way it does now; the museum has not been the only factor, but it has certainly helped),
I would recommend visiting the Guggenheim for the building itself
It is stunning
The inside depends a lot on the actual exhibitions
Some of the temporal art exhibitions have been excellent, some of them have been interesting, and some made me wonder what art is
I guess my tastes for art are a bit old-fashioned
There are KFCs in Spain but I have never been in one
I don't like battered/breaded meats generally speaking and I'm not fan of chicken meat (I only eat roasted chicken breasts)
There are some, but most people have never been there
Their fast food is too expensive; if you're willing to spend more money on your meal, there are a lot of fancier and healthier options here
The main reason people eat fast food is because it's cheap
I've never eaten in one, I think
Not as easy to find as the rest of fast food brands
I've seen a few of them though
It's more of a "we're next to a KFC might as well eat here", than the typical "let's go to Mcdonalds
I've never seen one
Apparently, there are less than 20 in the whole country
1KFC/15 million people
They're expanding fast
They plan to double the number of restaurants from 100 (mostly located in the largest cities) to 200 in a few years
I remember going a couple of times with friends
Nothing extraordinary, but it was fine
What caught my attention was that when I came to the US, a friend from Spain told me to never go to a KFC here, that it was way way worse than Spain
As expected, my curiosity got the better of me and tried
Go figure, he was right
Horrible, extremely dry meat
If that is the original chicken, I don’t get how it became a success
Agree
It's more likely to find it in large malls or big big cities, never in towns
nah, lots of kids even well into their 20's have no idea how to cook, wich might have to do with parents being overprotective or young people staying longer living with their parents than other countries (average age to leave your parents house is 29)
I'd say everyone can cook at least some basic stuff, I've lived in a shared apartment while I studied and apart from ordering food like once a week and eating pre-cooked meals once in a while, we all usually cooked for ourselves at least simple stuff
Same for all of my classmates back then
I guess Italy, we are not even close to them, but man, we get along really well
maybe Italy tbh
whenever there's an international party among students you'll always find italians and spaniards together by teh end of the night
many little things in common
Italy, definitely
I agree with everyone saying Italy and also Greece but I'd like to posit Argentina
Spaniards and Argentinians seem to get along really well and our accents are very similar
Argentinian singers have been popular here in the past too
Italy from the point of view of Spain is after Portugal our closest neighbor i think (France doesn't count because it's France you know)
Italy, Argentina, Chile
+1 to Italy
But we are actually not that far from each other
Menorca and Sardegna are "only" at 400km from each other
Madrid and Barcelona are actually further away from each other
Or as another example Catalonia to Tuscany is also closer than Catalonia to Galicia
Man has to meet other Men and Women then
I came to say the same
Since we share a border with France and Portugal, Italy is the obvious answer here
I'm usually pretty amazed when I read comments on this sub and it turns out that most Mediterranean day to day lifestyle is basically the same
Sometimes I even relate to greeks
Our way of living and thinking is extremely close and we share a lot of things (high value for family, high social activity, and a "Carpe díem" approach to life)
A lot of our customs are derived from roman times (Italy being the center of the empire and Hispania having three provinces, one of them being a senatorial province)
We are also heavily influenced by Catholicism, wich ties us togeter even closer
When I went abroad to study with people of other nationalities, the Italians and Spaniards were the first to get close and became friends
For some reason this is a misconception I've seen elsewhere
We have a lot of things in common, after all: Romance Mediterranean countries, loud and cheery people, glorious past and shitty present, good food, overrun with tourists, wild political landscape, corruption
Never heard that
Spain and Italy are very similar
Why do you think that
I'm curious
A lot of years ago (talking here 40-50 years) italians looked down on us but honestly, we get along pretty well
Lots of commom little things
And between spanish and frenchs, and germans and frwnchs, and english and french etc
You're also forgetting the whole part of hubbie Netherlands treating Belgium as inferior and restricting her freedom
One of my dreams is to meet with an Italian and try to have a conversation, but talking on our own languages, so we can try to see how much we understand each other
I think that we won't understand each other as much as I'd expect, because when I went to Portugal it was more difficult than it seemed, but I'd still love to try
I’ve had lengthy conversations where I spoke exclusively in Spanish and my interlocutor spoke exclusively in Italian and both could keep up as if it was a normal conversation
As long as no one talks too fast it’s doable
Podría funcionar
Es muy curioso
Es cierto
Porque con el portugués el francés, catalán y gallego me ocurre lo mismo
Siempre es más fácil leer
Cuando la conversación es hablada y no escrita, la pronunciación lo transforma todo demasiado, y se vuelve más difícil
Yo también estudié francés cuando estaba en el instituto y me pasaba lo mismo que a tí.
Qué maravilla
Te dejo tranquilo, que ya es tarde y hay que descansar
Muchas gracias y buenas noches
Buona sera
The damn -e's for femenine lmao
Fairly similar to Barcelona, fairly dissimilar to like Castrillo de la Reina, Burgos (185 inhabitants)
I haven't been there in a while but generally people aren't overly concerned with that and just live their life with some political discussions from time to time
Is the christmas national lottery a thing/tradition in your country
I'm from Spain, and the christmas lottery is a tradition I would say in most families
Is it a Spanish thing, or does it happen in your country too
I saw this question and thought "this is a question asked by a spaniard"
Someone said that he thought this question is silly bcs there is a new year s lottery in almost every country, and then delete it
If you re anywhere, my friend, perhaps a little more context was missing
The day of the Christmas lottery in Spain (december 22) is an important day, everyone puts the TV or radio on to follow the draw all morning
There is a lot of ceremony around the lottery
It takes place in a theater, with an audience, and the balls with the numbers of the draw are taken manually by the children of the San Ildefonso school, which in the past was a school for orphans
The children of San Ildefonso train very hard to "sing" the numbers, and their way of doing it is very recognizable (especially when they sing 1,000 euros, which is the most repeated price)
Instead of having a few big winners, the prizes are widely distributed and for days the news travels around the country visiting the winning locations and the lucky ones
Usually tickets are shared with family, friends, co-workers
the slogan of the draw is "the important thing is to share", meaning that the important thing is not to win the prize but to share it with our loved ones
The aim of the lottery isnt to make someone a millionarie, but to help many (especially to our Minister of Finance)
And of course there is the TV spot, which more than an spot is usually a short film that tries to move us and make us shed some tears (although there have also been very bad ones)
Fck off Santa, long live Lottery Bald Man
How big are the prizes
In Spain's Christmas Lottery, the big prize (El Gordo) is 3,000,000 € per number, which is to say 300,000 € per winning ticket
Wait, really
What do they say about it
Really
Every year
This looks the perfect moment to sit warm and comfy in the coach next to your hole family while watching the bingo and eating ham
That sounds really fun
we know our own
Oh that’s interesting, how did it even get over there
This is incredibly surprising
They make my eyes sweat every year :')
Would love to try that
Same kind of ads here hahaha
Merry xmas
what happened
that is some dark shit
Well our lottery is national, meaning it’s state run
I get it’s a waste of money (we call it the tax of the fools), but by no means is it a scam, plus the tradition around it is nice, and there’s always a small chance you make some money out of it
Afaik the christmas one is more likely to pay back than the other lotteries, so it’s not really the same experience
Not OP but yeah its a big deal
Even people that don’t usually play lottery will buy a ticket for this
Tickets start selling super early, as early as July I think, and if you procrastinate and wait to buy them at the last minute there are big queues at the shops that sell them
My parents don’t really buy lottery tickets throughout the year, but I asked them after seeing this post “do we have any tickets for tomorrow
”. Without any context they knew exactly what I was talking about haha (we do have tickets btw
Yes, except that one year with the 4 riders of the apocalypse singing
Holy crap
It the first time I heart about this, really surprising
It's not a thing we know in Spain
sign of things to come
No big deal, regular Spanish lottery has much bigger prizes at much cheaper tickets than Christmas lottery, which is even more absurd than the sole lottery concept
In Spain they are 20 euros per ticket
A ticket is one tenth of a series, which is a part of a number
So, for 20 euros you can get 300,000 euros
If I understand it correctly, in the NL you can get 30 million for 30 euros if you win
Thanks for sharing, really fun
By what I could see in the video, as you are able to choose the number and you can participate from 5€... Most probably they aren't official Spanish lottery tickets (you can choose the number in Spain but tickets are sold only in 20€ increments)
Probably the agency handles it as a regular "bet" in that agency, so it's technically a parallel game tied to the numbers of "El Gordo". Still funny to learn that there are people playing abroad
It happens also in Spain, there are lots of organizations making parallel games, including bars and restaurants that sell 100 tickets for winning a prize (e.g. a big basked with lots of gifts such as TVs, laptops, ham legs, etc
, but the most common is to have some christmas food in a fancy presentation)
As they are 100 numbers only, you win the price if your ticket number matches the two last numbers of the "Gordo" number
Just a typo, thanks for spotting it
I was interested in the prize amount in order to compare
With the Gordo you cannot simply retire and enjoy your winnings
With the Dutch prize you actually can
The possibility of winning El Gordo is 1/100,000, in case you are interested
There are quite a lot of winners
1 1st prize (a number, which is composed of 10 series, and each series divided into 10ths, which is what people actually buy); 1 2nd category prize; 2 3rd cat prizes; 4 4th cat prizes; 6 5th cat
For each prize there are 100 winners (as explained)
As far as I can remember, there are up to 1720 possible winners of the 300
000€ prize
70% of the collection is returned in prizes
Definitely it's gambling
In Spain, a 1/10 costs 20€ and it's already a official ticket, the full ticket costs 200€. They could be buying the real tickets to back up your bet and charging you a rather big fee for that, but I don't think that's the case as they allow you to choose between the 100,000 possible combinations rather than from the numbers they could have in custody
We also have non-official smaller fractions but they are often issued by other organizations that have the real number in deposit and sell tickets for raising funds
The tickets must be clear on what's your participation in the official ticket (e.g. [ this is the Spanish Association Against Cancer and they seem to shell 3€ tickets, 2
50€ for the lottery and 0
50€ as a donation for the organization)
Nop, there are 172 "series" of a number, not 10
In Spain the probability of getting the price of the ticket is 10%. But there are many prizes along the way
Overall it seems like the Netherlands it's the better deal, but with less chance of winning big
Thanks for the correction
I haven't bought a ticket in over 10 years, that's why I don't remember it well
I think we have a better deal, but say so to the winner
It's true that the biggest prize is rather low, but there are a lot  of winners of the main prize (usually with bigger prizes only one ticket gets it), also there are a lot of smaller prices
: Having a great talk with a pizza restaurant owner, and remembering the first time I crossed a country border
: Boating along in the Vaporetto with some good friends
: Watching the apes just play together next to me, so close you could even touch them (please don’t try that)
Yeah I have not traveled much
Portugal: Chilling by a swimming pool with a friend while drinking Sprite
Uk: Visiting the imperial war museum (god save the queen)
France: Idk, visiting Disneyland I guess
Belgium: Watching memes about article 13 in front of the european parliament
Netherlands: Spending the day in Amsterdam doing what you usually do visiting a city
wow this is gunna be a long one
England- Lived here as a student and have too many memories to count
I'd say the one that stands out is my first visit to the country, spend New Years with a friend on Primrose Hill in London and then went out to some pubs in Camden after
I had never been to the UK before so it was a nice introduction
Ireland- Went with an Australian friend to Dublin for a weekend, don't remember much because we were 2 pissed up 20 year olds
I remember the Guinness storehouse being really cool
I have to go back to Ireland and see it properly
Scotland- Went with same Australian friend to Edinburgh
We went whisky tasting which felt very educational to me at the time
I remember trying on suits of armor near Edinburgh Castle as well
Wales- Took a day trip to Cardiff with an ex girlfriend and we had a really nice day walking around the city and seeing the Castle
Portugal- Met some friends in Porto for a weekend where we did all of the classic tourist things - wine tasting, eating incredible food, and seeing all of the architecture
Spain- I have lived here for years, so that's hard
My favorite memory from before I lived here is going out to lunch with my friend's family in Alicante
They are quite well-connected in the city, and his dad is friends with some restaurant owners
Cue 4 hour long lunches with many bottles of wine on the Mediterranean beach front
France- I went on a "ski tour" with a friend's uni ski club for a week in Les Arc
I was the only non-brit in a group of about 150
We took coaches down from London, skied and partied our asses off for a week straight
Every night had a theme - one night was anything but clothing
We decided to wrap ourselves in duct tape - that hurt to take off
Denmark- Had a 12 hour layover once in Copenhagen, just explored the city with a friend who also happened to be there, ate good food and drank lots of beer
Belgium- Also had a long layover here
Ate lots of fries, drank lots of beer and was very disappointed by manneken pis
Netherlands- Spent a few days on the coast near Noordwijk with an ex girlfriend
The Dutch coast is very quaint
Germany- Spent a week there with an ex girlfriend's family
I met her in Frankfurt and we drove down the autobahn to her family's house near Stuttgart
It was August, lots of bbq's, hikes in the forest, and just nice german family time all around
This was during the London olympics, so we would sit around in the afternoons and watch some of the events
Switzerland- Same ex girlfriend lived in Lucerne for years
One day we took the boat around the Vierwaldstättersee and got off in some of the little towns - I remember Beckenreid, Fluelen, Gersau, Vitsnau
it was a really nice way to see some small swiss towns
Italy- Got hammered with my sister once in Rome and had second worst hangover of my life (see: Serbia)
Croatia- Spent a few days in an apartment on the coast outside Split with some friends
We bbq'd every night and drank lots of 2L bottles of beer
Albania- My friend and I met a German girl traveling the Balkans in her vintage VW bus in Berat
Convinced her to drive with us down to Sarande, google takes us down this stone/ dirt path through the Albanian Alps
6 nail-biting hours and 60km later we got onto a paved road in a small mountain town where we got scammed by some local mafia restaurant for lunch
Greece- Spent a few days in Athens on a trip around the Balkans
Saw all the sights, stuffed myself on souvlaki, and really enjoyed the vibe of Athens
I've seen some of the islands too, I had a really nice time in Kos
North Macedonia- Skopje is such a weird city
Couldn't get over all the new building and "fake" statues
Probably most memorable is eating dinner in the fake boat restaurant in the river
Kosovo- Stayed in the center of Prishtina and found some really nice little restaurants and bars in the city center
Serbia- Had train to Sarajevo the next morning at 8am, was going to stay in
Met some Australians, got hammered, chain smoked about 1000 cigarettes for some reason, ended up on a boat club in the Sava river until sunrise
Took a cab back to the hostel, slept 30 minutes, woke up feeling like ABSOLUTE hell
Threw up on the platform at the train station, got on the train and passed out
Got woken up as we crossed the border into Croatia, could not get back to sleep
Temperature was rising (July), got up over 35
We had no food, there was no food car
10+ hours of Serbian train in 35 degrees with no food and a brutal hangover
kill me
It's a great story now though
BiH- Was touring some of the olympic sites and while walking aroun some of the abandoned bob sled track in the mountains above Sarajevo the tour guide tells us "It's estimated that there's landmines up here every 15-20 meters, I could probably throw a rock and hit one
DON'T leave the bob sled track
Bulgaria- Visited Sofia in August, it was pretty slow since I guess everyone was on the coast for vacation
It was a nice relaxed city, but no significant memories
Romania- Drove around Transylvania with two girls we had met and saw Peles Castle, Bran Castle, and finished the day in Brasov
Really nice time, and gorgeous landscape and architecture
Hungary- Spent a week in Budapest with an ex girlfriend
It was January so we spent our time curled up inside, only going out for beers and food
It was a really nice cozy week in one of my favorite cities
Slovakia- I went to Bratislava by myself in 2011
Going up the Most SNP was probably the highlight
Ireland: my host brother and I playing with the PS4
France: camping with some friends
Italy: Visiting the Tuscany with my family
England: Harry Potter museum
Scotland: Buying a Scottish skirt
Germany: Mercedes museum at Stutgart
Monaco: Visiting the Casino
Portugal: I only went to the beach so
I guess that's it
Switzerland: Having a raclette at the hotel after skiing
Andorra: Visiting Andorra la Vella with my sisters
I think it is really cool that we have visited a lot of our countries, i really think it is amazing
Catalonia is on Spain tho
It's the good thing of Europe, we get to visit a lot of places in a few years
Never heard about him
Is there any film or book to which I can refer to
Edit, sounds like the German version of Pablo Escobar
Did Adolf built schools too
Oh yeah, he built even built especial housing for discriminated minorities
>I believe it’s the one with only one testicle
Ohhh yeah, you know that fascist dictator who seized power by slaughtering his political rivals in the 30s. You know the one, Francisco Franco
Well I think it would be quite obviously Catalonia since they have actually tried it a few times in history, the last of which quite recently
Edit: For people fighting over politics in the responses; I did not intend to originate discussion neither did I specify if I was in favor or against Catalonian independence
One piece of advice if you’re going to fight over this topic; don’t, it’s not worth it
Definitely Catalonia, as they already have been technically independent for 8 seconds
Galicia and the Basque country also have high chances, as the independent parties are very strong in their regional parliaments
What about French Guyana and those islands you have all around the world
What's the mood there
And the Basque Country, or even Galicia
But none of them are going anywhere
>do i really need to answer
Hey
I thought the same
Just imagine the Serbians
i think that Galicia is less likely than the other 2 but more likely that for say Leon
There isn't a real referendum supporting the idea of catalans wanting to secede
There was only one illegal and non-official poll with little participation where most of catalan people didnt vote, which means they dont really care, the separatists are the only ones making some noise
But Catalonia as a region def don't wanna secede from Spain, neither we want them to leave
Most who didn't vote didn't do it because it was illegal, not because they didn't care
I know some who would've voted yes but decided not to vote
Yeah
it looks really credible coming from a country who went to war over secession
honestly seen all the chaos that happens its normal to dont go
Well, not even the half of Catalonia voting means
that more than the half of Catalonia didnt vote, that most of catalan people didnt care about the referendum and that there are a quiet silent majority feeling spaniards
I understand what you want to see, it's your pov, but I wasnt wrong on my assumptions
Well
the thing is we also need Catalonia
Not only is it one of the economic centers of Spain it's also a right wing counterbalance
You just can't get rid of a region and call it a day
not in the US and not in Spain
>So it seems anachronistic to not allow secession
I'm sorry
do you know how many independentist movements there are
Because I think you underestimate the ubiquitous nature of the issue
But anyway, I also feel like having territories in the Caribbean is a bit anachronistic and that doesn't stop France, the UK, the Netherlands And the US from having them
If you want to know more details about the topic I'll give them, but I refuse to explain why a country wouldn't want a deeply engrained region to secede
I think it's pretty obvious
>In America it’s just assumed if California seceded no one would stop them
Except the constitution
for example
I think you have a very optimistic vision about the issue
There would be a terrible amount of problems with Californian secession
For example there's the fact that California doesn't actually own much of its territory
the coastline is part of the federal state and not the state of California
so would the new country have a coastline
What happens with federal property
What do you do with the thousands of homeless people in Los Angeles
most of which are from the now foreign US
Everyone is willing to give up the right to secession until it becomes a reality
just look at the UK trying to postpone the Scottish referendum
I'm tired of people holding a moral upper ground against us
when truth is most countries don't allow for seccesion and routinely have ignored calls for independence
Truth is no country wants their regions to secede
>Would Spain suffer economically if Catalonia were a depressed EU nation
Short answer: yes
Catalonia isn't just trying to secede from Spain but also get out of the EU in the process
Over 90% of Catalonia's exports are with the EU about 75% with Spain
Independence would most surely mean economic collapse for Catalonia and a really big hit for spain
And then there's the re-entrance:
Entering the EU ain't easy and the Schengen area is even harder and that's when there's no bickering
Ask Romania which got denied because the Netherlands feared droves of Romanians would emigrate to western Europe
Macedonia had to change its name to even get on the negotiation table
Croacia gave coastline to be in the EU
We had to weaken our production to not damage the french agricultural sector
Just imagine the situation for an lndependent Catalonia
It's ludicrous to think they would enter the union
Because what they want is to be richer and that's just not going to be the case
Catalonia has right now a priviledged situation in Spain
after independence they won't because it's no longer in the interest of the government to defend Catalonia's interests
>Ok I know this is almost off topic but where did you get the idea that the Feds own the california coastline
Look it up
they do
Most western states have a lot of federal land including California
The Californian coast is federal land
>It would be more like an extremely complicated Brexit
Hahahahahahaha
Brexit has already been extremely complicated
Separating the US and California would utterly destroy California
For example: they wouldn't have fresh water nor electricity
I'm not an economist but I'm pretty sure California would immediately go bankrupt
>legislature of California political prisoners
The Spanish constitution is very clear: secession is not allowed
They knew it and they went with an ilegal referendum
It is a crime, it's constitutionallly so
If California declared independence they would be on the same situation
because as I've already said secession is also illegal in the US and constitutionally so
I don't like the idea of political prisoners either, but they went against the explicit orders of the government
At the very least it's an embezzlement of public funds
>I did look it up to make sure
Almost my entire state is federal land
And most of california
But only tiny bits of their coastline
I meant the coastal **waters** ;)
>Only the UK clearly would handle it better
Well the UK is trying to impede a second LEGAL referendum
so I'm not that sure
There's also Ireland
which historically has been the weak point of Britain
Nothing like bringing a tank to the public stadium during a match or having an effective warzone in the middle of Belfast
>Spain handled Catalan very very poorly
The whole situation is a fricking disaster
In both sides
Tbh I can see a catastrophe happening just on account of negligence
And about the political prisons part
yeah, but Tejero was also a political prisoner
These political prisoners swore to upheld the constitution, it's part of their job
there are constitutional methods to change the constitution
They completely ignored them and instead used public money to held a referendum whose proposition is ilegal
Imagine if the governor of Alabama made a referendum to reinstate slavery
(I know it's morally completely on another league, but judicially it's equivalent)
>IMO it should take a supermajority (say 2/3) for a secession
In which case certainly Catalan and Scotland wouldn’t be allowed to secede
But like that’s just my opinion man
That's my opinion too
>What Britain is doing is fair since like it you just poll every year eventually you’ll get a yes
Yeah you're right but there is a legal debate, because the referendum is supposed to happen every generation **UNLESS** the situation drastically changes
hmm
guess what drastic change has happened since the last referendum
That's right BREXIT
>It’s what ten years until you can say it’s a new generation
I think it was 25-30
let's say Scotland is not "thrilled"
When I was in Greece I was shocked too
Here there are many stray cats, but that's all I would say
In my hometown there is a park that is full of cats everywhere
Nope
Here its really weird to find a stray dog, and most of times they are taken to the animal shelter immediately
There are way more stray cats, but they are not usually a problem, as they've learned to live with us
Some of them even allow you to pet 'em
Not at all, I've never seen a stray dog and there's some colonies of stray cats but they're usually controlled and feed by  associations or the city council and from time to time sterilized
What ink colour is the favourite/most used in your country
In Spain it is blue ink, but I personally prefer it black
What about you and your country
***P.D.: for clarification, I refer to pen ink and that kind of stuff
***
A friend of mine used to work at a notary's office in Spain and blue ink was strongly encouraged to avoid real signatures being confused with photocopied ones
It's common in Spain to invite the parents, usually mostly family and some friends
Kids play with their cousins and friends and parents drink coffee and chit chat
There are no elaborated organized games like in American birthday parties, we just let the kids roam
We usually don't give a lot of presents either and they are opened on the spot as they bring them
One thing that shocked me about America is how important it is opening the presents in front of everyone at the end as something to show off
I think it is very present-oriented
It's common in parties for children, but not to take care of them, but to share the work with the host and having some chit chat
Spanish moms (fathers not that much) usually befriend the moms' of their children's classmates
Once the kids are old enough to throw the party themselves, no parent will be nearby
Same in Spain (at least when I was a child)
Parents drop off their children and then come back to pick them up when the party is over
I guess it depends on the type of birthday
If it's only a few friends staying at the birthday kid's house, then the parents just drop their kids and leave, but when it comes to big parties (which are usually held at a venue where I'm from because almost everyone lives in apartments) it's kind of unfair for only a couple of parents to keep an eye on every single child while carrying on with the party at the same time
Usually the parents hang together but also keep an eye on the children and help the hosts with whatever they need
Yes, here it is very common for parents to attend birthdays too, although it is not usually an obligation, if they have something to do, they take the children to the party, congratulate the birthday boy or girl and leave
This happens from kindergarten to primary school (10-11 years old) more or less
Once they start high school they obviously become more independent
My experience regarding the organisation of birthdays is different from u/colako's. I was a child in the nineties and, I don't know if it was a local phenomenon, but mothers worked hard to organise games, yinkanas and piñatas to keep us entertained
I haven't been to many children's birthdays lately, but they were all at venues that specialised in birthday parties, with ball parks and that sort of thing
Maybe it was that my parents and family were not very educated
Is it common to study some of the dialectical differences of your language across regions
Does the educational system in your country give any time to the minor dialect differences of the way your language is spoken across regions
Here in Spain for instance we may study briefly the different Spanish dialects inside Spain itself, or even a bit of the differences with latino variants
We studied the differences among the different Catalan dialects, but I don’t remember ever having studied anything about the different Spanish dialects
Maybe its only a thing in Galicia
Can other spaniards confirm
Well, I studied regional "leismo" and "laismo" and some other differences such as c/s/z pronunciations in Catalonia but I recon we do focus more in Catalan dialects than we do with with the Spanish ones
Maybe Spanish has too many dialects
We did study regional accents a bit: Andalusian, the Canaries, Galician and also remember a bit from Extremadura and Madrid too I think
Either way it wasn't much, at most two or three lessons
Which one is the standard (British) English
This post refers to dialects, not languages
In Spain we study the separate languages in the respective regions, but im referring to different dialects of the main language
In Madrid we took a look at it but it wasn't particularly deep, at least seven years ago they did
I'm from Canarias, and for this trimester we have a project to analyse the 7 most popular dialect in Spain, including origins and the way they differ from basic castellano
It's worth about 30% of this trimesters grade so I'd say they take it quite seriously here atleast
It's also a thing in Asturias
I confirm but also from Galicia
I remember studying the different dialects in Galicia (the isoglosses was it
) during high school and bachiller, and only a brief look at the rest of the country and other Spanish speaking countries for like only a day or two
I studied in Madrid and was taught about dialectal variations, and the so-called Central-Northern Peninsular norm and Atlantic norm regarding pronunciation
It was in the 90's
I studied it in Castilla-La Mancha
Here in Valencia we study the different Catalan dialects, from Gerona to Alicante, including the variants in the Valencian Community (although there still are discussions about the language)
About Spanish dialect we only study something basic like the seseo and the ceceo
Apparently I'm the odd one out but I don't think we ever discussed that kind of thing in class
At most it was probably mentioned in the textbook but I don't think it was ever brought up, definitely not to the level of detail some other Spaniards are sharing (bloques dialectais, 7 most important dialects, etc
I took my entire education in Madrid, and I did the Humanities itinerary too
I'm pretty sure we didn't cover it because I've always been into that sort of stuff so I would've taken notice
i dont remember studying this
we just study how to clasify the dialects but nothing more
\-Castellano Leones here of Valladolid-
I'm from Barcelona but was schooled in Extremadura
We did study other dialects (especially castúo obviously) as well but sadly we didn't even bother learning about our own local language
Most schools in Galicia dont say anything about portuguese besides for "it used to be the same language than galician" and some medieval literature in galician class
I heard of one school that gives portuguese as an option to learn but its super rare, even tho the language is so close to us
We study some medieval literature from "galego-portugues" and stuff like that, but thats it
Alfonso X of Castille for instance, thought of Galician as the language of poetry and songs and published Cantigas de Santa Maria in Galician, but at the same time thought of castillian as the language of officiality and state documents
>We study some medieval literature from "galego-portugues"
Galaico-portuguese literature is also taught in Cantabria because it's relevant to Spanish literature as a whole
And also that damn poem in mozarab that popped up everywhere:
¿Que fareyo o qué serád de mibi
¡Habibi,
non te tolgas de mibi
It kinda looks like a weird mix of Catalonian, Portuguese and Arab
[Serranito] sandwhich
It consists traditionally of grilled porkloin or chicken filets (pounded very thin), cured jamon iberico, tomato slices, and a fried green pepper served on firm bread with olive oil
The pepper is the kind sometimes called Italian pepper, not bell peppers or any other types with thick flesh
These are popular as fair food in Andalucía.
[English Wikipedia]
Jamón with tomato and olive oil
Half of a sandwich made with two triangular slices of bread
Between the slices of bread are lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and a few slices of both ham and bologna, as noted by the Heavy
It is topped with a green pimento-stuffed olive pinned to the Sandvich by a toothpic
Lettuce, mayonnaise, sliced cheese and sliced tomato
Easy, cheap and tasty
Ham and cheese
The best thing I have ever seen
Mediterranean cuisine all the way
That is still my favourite
It is important too to use a good bakery bread and not the white sandwich bread that English use in their sandwiches all the time
Why would a republic ever want to be a monarchy again
What would they gain
Except that monarchs are people with inevitable political leanings and tend to favour the status quo (beyond political parties) and haven't historically been a barrier for authoritarianism (as seen by Spain and Italy in the past or nowadays Thailand)
Not to mention how the characteristics of such position can end up with monarchs and relatives taking advantage of their power and social influence
That a monarch is an avatar of the nation is more than arguable and in many cases not desirable because many people prefer not to give some dude a political position for life and all kinds of privileges because they were born in the proper family in the proper order with the excuse of being "an avatar". There are no theoretical nor practical benefits of having a monarchy in a democratic country
Developed, stable and wealthy nations are like that for a myriad of many different reasons unrelated to monarchism
If Sweden would become a republic it wouldn't stop being stable, wealthy and developed just like neighbouring Finland
It depends
Do I get to choose the part of Germany
If yes then the answer is Germany
If the answer is no I would choose Austria (prices in Switzerland aren't good for my blood pressure)
Germany because its the only country I know, but all seem very attractive
having really good living standards make me choose germany just because i would see the sea
Switzerland for paying less taxes and better jobs
Southwestern Germany without any hesitation
Reading the comments I'd say Renfe it's not as expensive as I thought it was
I study 500km away from home and every time I take the train (AVE, Euromed and commuter train) it costs me each way around 30-50€ and takes 7h, and I have only experienced significant delays in commuters
Some routes are maddenly expensive, however
Renfe's model is to juice the profitable routes to subsidise the others, and so routes like Madrid–Barcelona are really expensive, especially booking the same day or week
Often, if the city has an airport, it'll be cheaper to fly, but if it's a smaller place without an airport, then trains ought to be expensive compared to buses, etc
but not unaffordable
I just wish the mainline routes could be cheaper, however
It's very cool that we have such an extensive high speed network (most high‐speed rail in km in Europe
), but it's a pity that it's expensive to use to get between the main cities unless you book far in advance
But it really is fast, comfortable, and overall good
It lines up with what I know
I'd say cercanías in Madrid is around that price, 6€ for 60km (not counting season tickets)
That is unless you're young and from Madrid in which case they might as well let you in for free
20€/30 days, all public transport included
In my case that's 120km per 1€
Let's see how the new high speed low-cost AVLO works out
No, due to covid they now give a small bottle of hydroalcoholic gel and some santizing wipes
EVA was such a better name though
You could pick up Madrid and move it to the middle of the Atlantic and the government wouldn't even notice
[Tales of Count Lucanor] a medieval collection of tales where a count asks his advisor how to solve a series of problems and he answers telling a story with a moral
Aside from a bit of values dissonance, we had to read it in medieval Castillian, which was difficult
Tirant lo Blanc
Reading medieval literature (1490) is always hard, specially if it's not even in your dialect
They made you read quijote in old spanish
No wonder it was a drag
I had to but in a modern edition
I kinda enjoyed it
With *Don Quijote* do you mean only the first part
I liked Mecanoscrit del segon origen, it has teenage sex, that's always nice when you are 15 years old
I should read it again as an adult
That's actually a good book imo
A catalan friend told me that old and new catalan aren't that different (for some reason it had changed a lot less) sobitbwasn't that different but old spanish
Holly fuck that's boring
*La verdad sobre el caso Savolta* is unironically the best obligatory lecture we had
Heck, even people in my class who didn't like to read were theorizing about it in their free time, which is just wow
You are doing the Lord's work
"Servidor" was a word almost extinct, it meant servant, and it was a less used synonym of "sirviente". But nowadays "servidor" is a server in computers
So it is used again but with a different meaning
Did it fall out of use because of the SS motto
Meine Ehre heißt Treue "*My honour* is *loyalty*"
I went to the UK expecting rain everyday
It only rained like one day out of 7
Totally unacceptable
Unacceptable
I never stoo on pedestrian walks
In rome they are all maniacs
I swear to god i feared for my life every time i went into a taxi
We don't get enough sleep
That's our secret
That's how we party until 7 am
Our schedule is fucked up right from our birth
Nothing personal but
flair checks out
It was London and I think it was around May
But we invented siesta to compensate for our bad sleep
I swear to god
Like drivers were driving at 80 km/h in those narrow streets and like mounting on the tram's like platform all the time
Taxis were quick and thus, cheaper
But almost nobody takes a siesta anyway
That is bullshit, at least here in Spain people work their asses off
The problem is not lazyness, but incompetent administration and corruption, seriously our politicians are shit, either useless, or useless and thieves
speak for yourself
Those who do it just basically sleep for a while in the afternoon at home
I haven't heard of a single place where people do siesta at work in Spain
The Chinese do that though
>I never understood the siesta
To make you understand *why* does siesta exist, we have to go to Agricultural Spain
We can say siesta is a (mostly) southern thing and was indeed more common in agricultural Andalusia than the rest of Spain
You see, Andalusia's heat was and still is dangerous if not deadly + farmers schedules were elongated to the extreme by the landowners and they used almost their entire workforce to work on arid land during the day and part of the night
They almost had no night rest because they started their shifts early in the morning (usually way before dawn) and finished after sundown
As the shifts were long and they barely had rest they used their free time (usually from 11 AM to 15 or 16 PM) to sleep and recharge, a.k.a: siesta
Though, that free time was used because if they worked from 11 to 16, the heat and the *Terral* (extreme mass of hot air that comes from Africa) would probably kill almost all land workers
And that's how the half of Spain managed to survive extreme temperatures and abusive work enviroments and schedules by sleeping while the rest of the countries just didn't understand we didn't wanted to become part of the KFC menu
That you for coming to *Siesta 101*
Now, to your questions:
>How do you do it
Nowadays, it depends on your schedule
If you work during the day you don't do it but if your schedule starts at late-afternoon or night time you certainly gonna need sum good ass siesta
>Do you stop working and take a nap
I mean, if you want to get fired on the spot, yeah lol
>Where do you sleep if you're not at home
>Does everyone sleep or do you take turns
This two depend on the job
If you work as a doctor you may have a room to rest or sleep, to stop you from having sleep deprivation problems during your shifts
In that same case, it also works  by taking turns
Most jobs,though, don't have any of them
You have to wait until you go home and then take a nap
They know nothing about Switzerland aside from some cozy statistic one of their NRA members spilled out
Americans and Swiss are very different in terms of their day to day culture
Right wing (mostly white) Americans are super concerned with interacting/living in the same city/neighborhood as minorities and their feeling of power that guns give them keeps them at bay
without guns, they'd be forced to really try to mingle with their neighbors and get along without the forceful coexistence maintained by whites having guns and minorities fearing said whites
After all, guns were used to exert power over slaves and to pressure the government to not get involved in Southern communities (e.g. extra policing) where armed KKK-like people live
I live in one of the most expensive cities in the country, I have a nice normal job and I save at least 50%, after taxes, of my income
I have an apartment (100sqm, 3 bedrooms, balcony, garage, swimming pool
in a nice and young neighborhood) and most of my mortgage is already paid
I'm thinking in buying a house outside the city because I'd like to have a private garden but I don't like the idea of being too far from services, work, family and friends
I'm not sure what to do but I'm saving all the money I can and due to covid I don't expend too much
Before having a daughter I did one or two big trips a year and 5-10 small trips inside Spain or Europe
She goes to a public school and if she wants to, she'll go to a public university
We have public health insurance so mostly everything is already covered, I've paid for a couple of vaccines that weren't covered
I've seen average salary is 27k€/year before taxes so I guess I'm lucky middle class
I have friends earning more and less than that money but our lifestyles are pretty similar, mostly if changes the neighborhood, the car
I have some money invested in bitcoins just for fun, maybe in 20 years I'll have a retirement plan or I'll have nothing, I wouldn't lose much
I invested some money in the past but today you have to invest with high risk to get something and I have another plans in mind
In Spain middle class is almost gone
The thing is, with a small salary you can still live as the cost of living is not as  prohibitive as in the US
Is both
If there is no middle class is because the country is poor
You are either low class (not really poor, as people can pay their homes, water, electricity, phone bills, but they can barelly save money for luxuries like vacations in foreign countries and that kind of stuff) or rich
Yes, I sometimes mayor remember a word in Catalan or English but not in Spanish
I speak catalan at home and with friends/family, I barely use Spanish in my real life, but I watch tv and movies in spanish, I also read books and internet always in Spanish/English
So it's kind of weird but I believe I know more words in Spanish than in Catalan, I forget words in both languages sometimes but mostly I forget Catalan words
I believe this is because of the words used in normal conversations, that are usually very common, in comparison to words used in books/internet
Sure, call it a "senior moment".
All the time
In my case is more like the first thought comes in English and I have to force it in Spanish
This changes if I'm in Spain for a while but sometimes when I just arrive I mix both languages (Spanglish)
&#x200B;
In a few days my brain set Spanish as primary language haha and the issue fades away
Norwegian
I don't know since I can't notice the difference, I mean, when I see a nordic person speaking I don't know if he's speaking swedish, finnish, danish, norwegian or icelandic
I'd totally love it :)
Interesting idea, worth a try
well, first we better ask around to see who's available :)
"La 1" (namely: the one / the first one) is the first one in the list and it is a public government-owned channel (part of the major collection of government-owned channels "RTVE" = spanish radio television)
In regards of popularity, according to statista, "Telecinco" (literally "telefive") is the most popular one , having attained a 14
5% audience share during the last year
This channel is mostly known for its celebrity / gossip tv shows
Also this channel is owned by Mediaset, a larger tv broadcasting italian company
TIL Mediaset is italian
I remember watching RTL in Spain back when we had the old antennas
Oh I didn't know that
Guess they didn't think very hard when they named the one in spain then ROFL
Do you remember when Tele5 started showing seminaked ladies in every show (las mamachicho y tal)
That's right after Italy (Berlusconi's Mediaset) got involved
IKR !!!! I learned that pretty recently too
Happy cake day !!!!!!
Thanks
Amazing how fast a year goes by
Thanks
I honestly hadn't even noticed lol
Because of how imperatives are constructed, many of our most usual verbs have them sound awful, so people end up changing them for a more natural sounding construction
Problem is, if you use the imperative according to grammatical rules you automatically sound  snobby and pretentious, but if you don't, it sounds vulgar and lazy
So for several important verbs, there are only wrong options
English: teaching my 5yo to read is a nightmare
So many exceptions and nothing is spelled the way it looks
English spelling is a cluster fuck
Spanish: I dislike not having a word for toes
I don't know why it bothers me so much, but after 15 years, saying "feet fingers" still sounds dumb to me
Nowadays most people use the infinitive form instead of the imperative, you can even see it in working emails
I agree with the comment above but for me using the infinitive, especially written, looks extremely uneducated
Funny thing, Google keyboard tends to automatically change the correct imperative form and use the infinitive instead
Bloody annoying
It's a bit of a mix
For instance the reflexive plural imperative of Ir (to go) should be 'idos', but that sounds awful
So a very common alternative is 'iros', which preserves the root of the infinitive
That has actually been accepted by the Spanish Academy of Language
But then lots of people will just say 'irse', which is basically just infinitive (+reflexive) but conveys the imperative function somehow
Now that I've written this out, it sounds much more complicated than I anticipated
Sorry, I guess
Iberian Union back intensifies
And as a Portuguese said already in this thread, it wouldn't last long, the same history as some centuries ago
\- Portugal: they would try to break apart
\- France: we would try to break apart
\- Andorra: nah
\- Morroco: Balkans 2
0 Gibratarian Boogaloo
\- Great Britain: we'd have to ask Scots how well they're doing with England
I foresee something like the human centipede but with countries
I agree to get married, but only if we are ruled by Portugal and not the opposite, our politics and our territorial organization are a mad house
&#x200B;
JajajjajajajjjaJj
We'll take town by town like with Olivenza
Then, after 200 years you realize Portugal is only Lisbon and Cascais
ha ha ha (evil laughter)
Well, Olivenza would be easily solved
It doesn’t belong to Portugal, it doesn’t belong to Spain, it belongs to the union :)
What would be bad about merging with Spain
OP did not say invasion, said merge, but whatever, you can keep your prejudices
We basically copied most of how the administration works from you, so it is not that different
That's the premise of the EU, isn't it
Really, if you annexed NK USSR-style, nothing would change
If anything, puppet government would no longer have access to nukes, so win-win
Though it would be sad to see Korean disappear from half of the Korean Peninsula
A Franco-luso-hispano-british union
WORLD DOMINATION BABY
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I don’t know why you’d be nervous
People would throw *fireworks* everyday in celebration
Now doesn’t that sound lovely
_Cries in Catalan (Mallorca dialect) for having to learn German now_
Well at least I will have free university although no more Google Street view
Nah
We treat all of our communities well, and have never ignored any of them
Right \*reads hand\*, uh santundar and ah, extremoduro, and that place that’s called like a wine
Well, we don't want anyone that deep fry pizza either
:-)
Do you have your own Police
Do you manage your budgets in security, environment, education, culture and health on your own
Is your language co-official with English
Do you have your own taxing
That's how our Communities work
I guess we would be in the middle xD
I mean, even without annexation, it’s still a good idea to learn german in ~~Spain~~ Mallorca
We don’t have any common borders, but can we join too
I left it out on purpose
You don't seem to understand the concept of merge
You should leave the EU, because Germany's interest prevails, as it has more votes
Actually, true, in all seriousness
We tried doing that with the French, did not work out too well
Don’t recommend allowing another country’s army to march through yours either “accidentally” nor accidentally
Wrong
In Spain, more or less one third of the laws come from the EU, one third come from the country and one third come from the regions
My opinion is that you have some prejudice against Spain or the Spanish people, maybe I don't have enough information to state that, but that's my impression
No tengo ni idea
I don't do that, so I don't know
You just said "I don't know".
The word for Flemish in Spanish is 'flamenco' (like the music genre)
So you could imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered that Flanders it wasn't what I thought it was
I guess the melanin skipped a generation here or i'm adopted, as a blond green eyed person
Our days are longer and social life doesn't end when the day's over
I kind of understand that, when you see it from outside it feels like we are lazy and don't work hard enough I suppose
We just have more free time
I mean, to be honest I've worked abroad and we do have this attitude of not working too hard because "they'll pay us the same anyways" (which I think is a pretty fair way of thinking, specially considering out shitty salaries, and I proudly do it myself)
If we can put less effort without consequences we do
The problem is many places ignore worker's rights, and things like unpaid extra hours still being a thing nowadays, specially if you're young and no one else is willing to hire you
We are laid back but at the same time some business treat us like slaves
well
some things seen from today's perspective can be considered pure evil, let's not erase that
But it is true that there is a lot of "Black Legend", mostly spread by countries like The Netherlands and Britain I think
Yeah that also baffled me for a bit
I even wondered what the language was like (it was either like the flamingo sound or like flamenco music as in it's spanish but like a son g and hard to understand)
Did you ever try it out to see if it worked
Yeah, i thought everyone in the US learnt Spanish bc we learn English, and some of them do but not at a good level, and even then don't know where Spanish speaking countries are
I also thought that the reason germans learn spanish in school was because in Spain you can learn german in school
I really thought learning languages was an exchange, too bad it's not :(
Maybe the sound but the vocabulary is really similar, I can read Italian without going to an Italian class ever but I can say the same about French and Portuguese
I would say  French is more similar to catalan than Italian
Edit:if you wonder how we could sound Italian while speaking Spanish just listen to any Argentinian
Yeah, it was definitely Britain
I figured lol, just like the whole irish=redhead
True that's also a good point
I didn't notice you didn't said lazy
It's kind of the biggest stereotype so I instinctively went for it
Sorry
It was John, I hate that guy
Geographically it's closer to catalan and I speak Spanish, Catalan and had French at school
But don't believe me, it's in the same language branch too
Yeah, and I don't agree
Italian and Spanish are way closer in structure, pronunciation and spelling to each other than to French
That's why Spanish and Italian are mutually comprehensible languages while French and Italian/Spanish aren't. You can look it up
Not in my house
But my aunt used to set up one in her house for Christmas Eve dinner
If there were enough kids (3 or more) then yes, to let the kids have fun with each other and adults have some relative freedom
Not really
In my family kids were seated to a side with the smallest being beside their parents
Totally
Even when there are enough empty seats
It's a neat way parents have to be able to have dinner without being bothered by a kid each 2 minutes
We don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but yes during our family meetings we usually had naturally a kids table, because the adults always talked about boring stuff and we wanted to be able to get up and run around if we wanted to
We are about 15 cousins and the adults alone already filled a table, so it was the best solution for everybody involved
Now nobody cares, we are all grown up, many don't come to such family meetings anymore
Kids table only still exists, cause the "adults" still talk about boring stuff
Not in my family and never have met onyone that do it
Wouldn't surprise me if they do it in big gatherings
You know each day I'm more sure that we are all the same lmao
I never had one in my house, and when I went to someones house I hated it
Yeah, but now that I'm older I understand
I know in France is not usual, but 46C is not the end of times
Meh
I’m not competing
Just drink lots of water even if you don’t feel thirsty, avoid sun from 12 noon to 4 afternoon and you should be fine
Plan for an A/C machine next year
Climate change is here to stay
Believe me that in Spain houses are not inmune to this weather
There’s tricks to easy the heat wave as I told to the comment above
It’s quite useful to have an A/C machine
Worth it even for one week per year
Not rude but if you do that in my home town many people will think you have a sad life or something since you can't enjoy a "proper" meal
By other side if you do it in Madrid or Barcelona nobody will care
Yes
People will look weird at you
Spanish sit down to eat as long as it needs
Only exceptions are pastries and things like that
No, why should it be
Even in Madrid the first thing I would think is: poor guy/gal, he probably has to eat really fast to keep working
Yeah, usually it's more common in bigger cities or known touristic/university settings
Also, just so you know: "by other side" doesn't really work in English, you should use "on the other hand" or "on the other side".
I'm from Madrid
I once had to eat my lunch while going to the bus station so i didn't loose the bus
Felt like a looser and stupid AF
I've never seen someone eating something else than a sad snack while walking on the streets, maybe only tourists
Sitting on a bench or park yes, though, and i have done it, but not many times
Thanks ;-)
Then your schedule sucks hairy balls
Most workplaces leave ample time for lunch (some would say too much time)
Yeah, I also have heard mostly "on the other hand", but just as I was writing it I checked and apparently "on the other side" has also been used, albeit way more sparingly, in some official documents of organizations as important as UNESCO, so I thought I should add it
It's quite possiblethat Bismarck didn't really say this, but it's always been attributed to him:
«I am fairly convinced that Spain is the strongest country in the world
Century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success».
Like I said
Quite probably misattributed, but it kinda holds some truth
«[Las dos Españas] is a pretty well stablished concept within our identity
"I would sooner be a foreigner in Spain than in most countries
How easy it is to make friends in Spain
" - George Orwell
How many justices are there in your countries' Supreme Courts
In Spain, the Supreme Court is composed of some 100 justices (called magistrates), divided into several specialised halls of justice:
- First Hall, or Civil Hall
- Second Hall, or Criminal Hall
- Third Hall, or Administrative Hall
- Fourth Hall, or Social Hall
- Fifth Hall, or Military Hall
And then there are some special halls:
- Hall of Article 61 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary Power
- Hall of Jurisdictional Conflicts
- Hall of Conflicts of Authority
The members of the Constitutional Court are judges or can they be professors of different aspects of the Law
I think the Conseil Constitutionnel would be equivalent to Spain's Constitutional Court, which is actually a council and not a court
Leaving the Conseil Constitutionnel aside, what would be the court that is highest up the judiciary foodchain in France
Cour de Cassation
It seems that your highest courts are more than adequately staffed
> If ya mean the highest court to try someone in a criminal, civil, familiar and so on then it's the " Supreme court of cassation"
That one was actually my question, the apex of the judiciary foodchain
So, more or less like Spain
In Spain, the mandatory retirement age for judges/justices/magistrates is 72
Interesting
In Spain, the judiciary chain would be:
\- First instance and instruction tribunals
\- If you appeal, it goes to the Provincial Court
\- The next appeal would be towards the Regional Superior Court
\- And lastly, the Supreme Court
The Supreme Court, of course, has exclusive jurisdiction for cassation appeals, meaning that you appeal alleging that the Law has been incorrectly applied and you want the Supreme Court to set juridical doctrine on the correct application of the Law
For some reason I thought that would have been Jena or Heidelberg
In Spanish it's very, very easy
Numbers 0-15, all multiples of 10 up to 100, and 500 are unique words (some of them share a common structure but it's easier to just learn them by heart)
Everything else is a composition of numbers in decreasing value
Example 1:
6 = seis
10 = diez
16 = dieciseis (diez + seis)
Example 2:
7 = siete
20 = veinte
100 = cien
127 = ciento veintisiete (cien + veinte + siete)
Example 3:
8 = ocho
40 = cuarenta
300 = trescientos (tres x cien)
1000 = mil
1348 = mil trescientos cuarenta y ocho
Edit: As I've been pointed out I had forgotten about 500, which uses the same prefix as 15
Unsurprisingly, Afrikaans is identical except for the spelling
In galician we have both quiñentos and cincocentos
I did forget 500 (fixed now) but I said numbers 0-15 right at the beginning
And I did not think OP wanted to know about ordinals but they're even easier
Veinte y siete - > Veintisiete, because 'ei' becomes just i
It's latin all the way down
We certainly had foreign troops (Americans) in several bases, (Torrejón, Zaragoza, Morón de la Frontera) and there is still US Navy presence in the naval base of Rota
The other bases are still in use by our army
Another year in which for XYZ reason, I haven’t been on reddit for enough time to entirely miss the survey
Oh well
Count another gay man o’er here
I like this one
Good summary
LA ROSALÍA.
She's starting, the time will tell
Las kétchup- asereje
Los del rio- la macarena
Julio iglesias- julio iglesias idk any song
La pantoja- marinero de luces
Marta sanchez- soy yo
Monica naranjo- sobrevivire
Rocio jurado- como una ola
Ruth lorenzo- singing in the rain
Pastora soler- quédate conmigo
Btw she is fucking amazing
They were and are very famous in Spain and some Latin American countries
I think ruth lorenzo and pastor soler deserve a lot more fame chenoa and rosa too, they both have a lot of talent
La Rosalía!!!!
Héroes del Silencio :) and Enrique Iglesias :/
La Rosalía is a recent one
Alejandro Sanz ...idk if he’s still relevant though
Also Nek and Pino d'Angiò
What about Mahmut Orhan
You missed The Corrs
Omg i forgot her, rosalia too thx
Oh, sorry, true
my mistake
We use the phrase 'que tal' as greeting
It means how are you but we just use it as a greeting for some reason
I mean, Klaus is pretty good
You might know it
I really liked Buñuel and the Labyrinth of the Turtles too, which came out a few years ago
Calico electrónico was hilarious
"Coger" just means to grab in Spain, but it means to fuck in much of Hispanic America
I have one of these
In Colombia, the word "marica" means something like lad in the UK or dude in the US
Meanwhile, in Spain, the exact same word is a derogatory term used to mock gay people
"Concha" means "shell" in Spain but "pussy" in much of Latin America
It can get specially funny because in Spain the affectionate nickname of Concepción, a common female name, is "Concha".
"Coger" in Spain means "to pick up" (something), but in latin America it means "to fuck". So if you say, "voy a coger al perro y luego vuelvo a casa" in Spain would mean "I'm going to pick the dog up and then I'll come back home" but in latin America would mean "I'm going to fuck the dog an then I'll come back home". So
You can imagine the problem xD
The same things goes for "agarrar"
In Spanish "excitado" also means turned on (sexually)
We just say we're "emocionado" (thrilled in a good way)
Your link didn't link properly :(
"Joder" as in "fuck" is archaic in Spain
It's something you'd expect to hear in a historical movie
Most people use it in the non-sexual way
Pretty popular, most of men don't shave it and have beard (taking care of it, I mean, not an irregular beard)
Unfortunately there are many who don't take care of it (or do but just don't have anything worth taking care of)
Probably bad lol
The last games weren't the best, Germany is doing even worse so that one doesn't really count
I wouldn't be surprised if we go home on the first round of the knockout stage
Edit: I just looked the groups up
That F group can't be real
Maybe with the covid football is less annoying, but I usually hope it loses ASAP, so people start behaving normally (their obsession for football is very annoying and I just want to continue living normally)
Russian and Italian are the best sounding imo
But if it's written, then I find Gaelic oddly exotic
I love Italian
It has a nice musicality around it and it is so expressive
My favorite is English, easy enough to learn and useful
The one I like to hear the most is probably Italian, sounds super cool
Italian and Japanese
For some reason, I really like spoken Greek, how which I don't understand anything
Que te jodan, hijo de puta
Happy cake day
Que te joda un pez espada, hijo de la grandísima puta
Voy a coger una escalera para subirme a los cuernos de tu padre a cargarme en tus putos muertos
king philip the second
great king in spain
hated in portugal maybe
[**Francis Drake**] He was a literal pirate, i think he's praised in the UK
Also he was the leader of the [british counter-armada] wich many people dont know about
Hernán Cortes
Pictured as a genious, brave, and astute conquistador over here
Not so loved in latin america
like the duke of Alba
oh come on
that poor guy
he was like a milenial in his time, he just wanted to chiil and hunt
hate the actual gobvernant, the duke of Lerma hahaha
Piet Who
yeah, pretty brutal guy
one doesn't earn a repitation as a general by being peacefull haha
Wouldn't that be the Count-Duke of Olivares, though
He was the guy who ran the show and tried to implement the Union of Arms
Hm for obvious reasons
Spanish is the second language by number of native speakers and the third most spoken language in the world
It's also the second or third most written language in the world
If that's the path we'll be among the last to die
My language is a minoritarian one, but it's not like we're all going to start speaking English out of the blue, specially since the level of English here is very low
Spanish is a much greater threat to the Valencian language than English
Nope, although American Spanglish could have some slim chances of being a threat if it becomes a too mixed, too big and too influential pidgin language
nope not at all
having a language that is the 2º in native speakers in all its dialects i honestly dont feel that like a treath
Hmm
I think im the only one who  isnt concerned only because I think a global language is the way to go
Sure, not in my lifetime, but I hope everyone in the world speaks the same language long-term
I'm not worried in the slightest for Spanish
It's the second largest by native speakers, and the third overall
It's true that English is influencing our grammar and the way we speak Spanish more and more, but it's far from disappearing
Galician however
I do fear that unless we do something about it, it's doomed
And not because of English, but Spanish
People (including myself
I was raised speaking Spanish) use it less and less
We are seeing some neofalantes (new speakers: people raised in Spanish deciding to use Galician) among the late millenials / early gen z, but it'll take more than that
The population is getting old, a lot of Galicians emigrate (thus they no longer have the need to use their language in any situation), and yeah, it's declining in use
Language is such an important aspect of our cultural identity, it really is sad seeing some of them go extinct
Hopefully neofalantes can turn the tables, we'll see
Spanish is another language spoken round the globe, so no, i am not worried
Agree
A lot of people learn French as their third language (after English), and it's still very important internationally, being the diplomatic language of choice
Not for anything most passports are written in three languages: the native of the country, English and French
And as a Galician I honestly cannot help myself but admire how most people in Quebec still prefer using French, their own language, before English
So yeah, French ain't disappearing anytime soon either
Conquistadores are iconic but they have kind of a bad press right now
The aragonese Almogavars, they were fighters from the aragonese crown, originally they were mostly shepherds/farmers from the aragonese and catalan pyrennees
They were not well equipped, instead they went with lightweight armor (helmet, some fur, sometimes a chain mail) and with light weapons (long knifes, short spears, curved swords
), they also didn't fight in a formation, but they kind of fight something closer to a current guerrilla fighting
They were poorly dressed and commonly with long beards/hair
Mostly fighting on foot
They cut supply lines, fought on the night, stroked by surprise
Against horses, they tended to attack the [hocks] or the guts, to make the rider fall and then get on top of him and kill him with the knives
They liked to fight in harsh conditions, with trees, stones, etc, that they could use in their advance and also preferred to fight in a open way, but if they were in a disadvantage they could use a formation for defending purposes
They were commonly mercenaries, and went to enemy territory, sack it and take loot, create chaos and go out before the enemy strikes back
As they looked for loots, their incursions could be of a few days long until they get a good one, that was a reason of the needing of a lightweight equipment, so they could move fast for days, loot, destroy, ravage and go out
An interesting thing was the psicological warfare, they had a flint stone with them, they used to crash it against their sword before battle, throwing big sparks while they screamed ("Awake iron
", "Aragon, Aragon
", "Saint George
", ...) to frighten the enemy
However, the most famous story about them is when the biggest almogavar company went outside
As time went, the aragonese crown frontier against an islamic enemy, which was their way of living, was getting smaller, so the crown of Aragon sent them to fight in Sicily/Naples, but after peace was sign, the almogavars had no job, and you can't have that kind of troops in your territory without nothing to do, so Aragon signed a treaty with the byzantine empire and  around 4000 to 10000 almogavars went to fight the turks
Long story short, after a lot of fighting and a lot of killed turks, the almogavars demanded payment, byzantine emperor denies it, almogavar leader gets killed by him, and in revenge, they started a campaign of looting, ravage and extermination of byzantine civilians, during it they also defeated a big byzantine army in the process and killed the alans mercenaries that helped the byzantines (around 9000)
They keep in their revenge thing until they move to Athens they took Athens and then Neopatras and ended giving that territory to the Crown of Aragon
Los tercios
They were a military unit, feared all through Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries
Increadibly flexible and experienced in battle
They dominated european Battlefield for 120 years and were behind many famous victories like the Battle of San Quintin where they annihilated the french army
Bandoleros in southern Spain definitely
They were brigands that roamed around Sierra Morena during the 19th century
The most iconic one was José María Hinojosa Cobacho, known as El Tempranillo (The Early Bird)
He was born into a poor family suffering from the privations of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain at the beginning of the 19th century
He is widely believed to have killed his first man at the age of just thirteen, either as the result of an attack on his family or an insult aimed at his mother
Evading capture, he joined a group of bandoleros who were based in a cave near the Despeñaperros pass on the main northern route into Andalucía. They were essentially highwaymen, collecting a sort of ‘toll’ from rich travellers to ensure their safe passage through the region
El Tempranillo was somewhat of a charmer, and his fame soon spread
He was also likened, as others before him, to Robin Hood, as he redistributed his ill-gotten gains to the poor
He became a cult figure, not only in Andalucía but also farther afield
Some European tourists to the area even went so far as to pay to have themselves ‘held up’.
I won't lie, if I ever meet someone named Lil' Flute I expect him to rap while playing the flute
If we're talking about **cool** Spanish groups we could mention bandoleros, not conquistadores
Do you mean the likes of Serrallonga and Rocaguinarda
No more than vikings
Drakkars and Galleons
Both serve to attack other peoples' land unprovoked and steal their riches
Now, no contest
I'd even choose being born today, so technically living 25 years into the future
Wouldn't want to go too much into the future, though, just in case
Would have been good to have been born in the 70s. The great recession hit when I was meant to join the labour market
I would have been better positioned to weather it
If I had to pick a historical period, I'd go for 18th century's New Granada
King Charles III funded a number of [scientific expeditions] being part of which would have been fascinating
I would've loved to live my youth in the 80s and 90s, when the economy was booming, we just got out of a dictatorship and the future looked bright
But then again, I would've been part of creating the problems that the current youth faces
Besides all that, I'm a gay man, so I don't think it would be nice to live in a time when my basic civil rights were still put up to question
I would've been forced to either a youth in the closet or a much more rampant homophobia than I've experienced in my life as it is
Taking only that into account, I guess I'm living in the best time period I could ever imagine lol
Today
None, seriously
It's been complicated
So basically right now would probably be the best
At least we have internet
I would prefer to don't go much in time, so maybe 1992 for Barcelona 92 and The Expo that happened in Spain that year too, maybe another travel to 1999, and that's about it
The 1860s-1890s i d love to see the new ideas in Spain flowing in and the industrialization
If I could retain all of my memories then probably the 20s and 30s. I could warn people about certain things if they'd believe me
If I'm born without memories then the 70s would be a good time
> Yes, there were things going on then that are now considered distasteful
That's a very mild way of speaking about the horrific conditions of the working class, the vast majority of the population, and the whole package of colonialism
You Brits can be proud about many things, but if you decide to be proud of an idealised vision of the Empire it's pretty understandable that people consider it politically incorrent
I agree that victorian age might have been an exciting time if you were a male bourgeois with all those technological progresses, tho
Nobody is going to criticise you for feeling proud about Parliamentarism, ending slave trade, your literature, your popular music, your many scientific discoveries and even the industrial revolution
As long as, you know, acknowledge that it did cause a lot of suffering to the working class
It gives a really bad impression that you dismiss that as "things that are now considered distateful", almost to the point of seeming like a parody
Here's the thing: history for a long time has been romanticised by nationalisms everywhere, not only in Britain
And now people look at it through a different lens and they see that it wasn't all glorious warfare against the enemy^(TM), court politics and exquisite art
People are now looking at other aspects of history and it turns out that things were pretty bad for a vast majority of people until very recently
And many people are going to identify with that majority of people
The views about the past have changed and I don't see how that's a bad thing
I think not having that idealisation actually makes us see the good parts in a better way and not dismiss the bad parts so that we try not to repeat them because history isn't a line of uninterrrupted infinite progress
Maybe it's more pessimistic, but I think it's better than a romanticised bliss of ignorance
In Spain dubbing directors usually take a lot of libertys if tgat makes a better product, for example in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when Rocket is mocking taserface he calls him "cara anchoa" (anchovy face)
This comes from a youtuber who a month prior was slapped for calling a man the vwry same thing
EDIT: (apparently this comes from the original version) Another example would be in the Avengers movies, during caps planning of tge battle of New York, Iron Man calls Hawkeye "Legolas"
A last one, in the Netflix show Superdrags, tge three protagonists say "Hadta luego Maricarmen" (Goodbye Mari Carmen)
Another joke that was told because here tgere is a gay tv host that once said that complaining or something and then became a Meme
The Fresh Prince's American-centric jokes were changed by Spanish ones, as I doubt Pippi Långstrump was ever released in the US, for example
In the original american dub for TF2, spy has a french accent, but in the french dub, he has a british accent
I also heard that the heavy sounds really smart and intellectual in the russian dub instead of just a dummy like in the english dub
Regarding Spanish i can't think of anything
Fresh Prince's dub was 100% made up in Spanish and it was brilliant
To a lesser extent, Simpsons and Futurama were made up or at least heavily adapted too
Oh, then i was mistaken (i would swear that scene had joke in there)
But i have another example from Avengers that doesnt go on the joke side
The scene where the SHIELD agent is playing Galaga, or another retro game, Stark says "that man is playing the martians" martians (marcianitos) is the name given to Space Invaders
It was done because Galaga either wasnt very popular in Spain or straight up didnt arrived, but space invaders was not only popular (in the 80s) but it also became some kind of standarized name, like when adults call all the consoles Nintendo
I'll try :P

Ouch, one of the lowest scores on the whole thread
Could you send me the list on DMs
I don't know the exact number, but in my island, which is very small, there is [one] So i assume there are many throughout the country
> My Dad does this
He claims he gets confused with "what word is appropriate to use" but I've explained it at least five times so at this point, I just say something like "How do you know that someone is old
They don't know they shouldn't use the N-word
" My Dad always likes to pretend that he isn't that old so I know I can get him with this
I feel kinda bad about it but NOT using the n word also isn't hard, especially after it's been explained to you why you shouldn't.
Does your family speak in english or what
Ah so it's another word that has been assimilated to the english one
South Europe
And those who live in the coast of the the Mediterranean sea (as myself) would say, also, that they are  Mediterranean
We are part of the Iberian peninsula
At least we can agree on that one :P
FWIWI I've never doubt it
Good one
I've always thought Austria IS the most central european country in Europe
I am not sure if there’s such a majority feeling that way
In the north I feel most people would say we are Western Europe
I think there's a greater consensus of us being Iberian
The only thing that my grandmothers agree on (one is from Valencia and the other one is from Barcelona) is that they are Mediterranean
Southern Europe IS a bit of a hotchpotch
Greece and Spain have very little in common apart from the weather
Culturally we're Closer to France
You are not Mediterranean, not because you're not by the Mediterranean sea, but because you are not shouting and yelling all the time
It's a privilege to share that with you, neighbors
Yeah, I'd say we're Western Europe
I'd say Western europe
Tell that to the Canarios
Indeed
To me, the whole Southern Europe concept is too vague
I feel like it’s only agreed by people either from the most stereotypical, Mediterranean areas that could correspond to the mental image of this concept (Mediterranean people feeling like they are Mediterranean Europe, which can be valid for regions of these countries but doesn’t apply to the whole of them) or by tourists that go to these areas and think that they define the whole countries
The majority of Spain is closer culturally to France than to Greece, and the majority of Greece is closer culturally to Serbia than to Spain, with due respect for all of these countries, which shows how Southern Europe is too, too tenuous of a cultural idea
Also, OP probably shouldn’t gatekeep western Europe
But they are not even in Europe, geographically haha
Mmm no, take a look at a map, the UK is way east of Spain, Ireland is at the north
I think the reason it's been established IS that there IS a cultural tie in the mediterranean, Portugal, Spain, Italy, even southern France and Malta are very much alike
The problem comes when you get to the balkans
They have a different history, slavic and turkic influences, the greeks, orthodox christianity, It just feels quite different
I live by the border and even the next town (which I can almost see from my window) is a world apart
Yeah, It has less extreme weather than the Atlantic, in general, fewer and smaller waves and weaker tides
And it's definetely warmer
That said there are very dangerous chokepoints like the straight of Gibraltar
There ARE tides, and there can be storms and big waves
I understand that, but I feel like that cultural tie is clear in the Mediterranean areas but starts disappearing when heading inland
Some of these countries are culturally more heterogeneous than the UK, Netherlands, Baltics
and grouping the whole of them together under a supposed ‘Mediterranean’ culture is just too much
By that rule of thumb we’d be considering Mediterranean, for example, some of the regions with a larger Celtic cultural background such as Galicia and Bretagne, Germanic parts of southern Tirol
it just feels vague
Yeah, but i'd say even a galician has strong cultural ties with a sicilian, (i would say more than with a dutch)
However there are very near to being an exception
Of course in any closed set there are fringes, don't Matter what you do
>more heterogeneous than the UK, Netherlands, Baltics
I think we often underestimate the enormous differences that small island has
That being said, Italy and Spain are among the most multicultural countries in Europe
I would say western european has roughly two subsets: northwestern european and southwestern european
And as with all cultural changes it's mostly a continuous change
Those are very good points, I generally agree with those
About the UK, having lived there I stand for my point
For the amount of population living there, the differences in gastronomy, folk
are way smaller than what you’s expect, and the massive relative weight of England’s population has meant that the differentiating feats that you may expect to find in Cornwall, Wales, Scotland
have deteriorated quite a bit
The Sicily bit is also subjectively debatable
As a Leonese, I have felt much more alien in Sicily an in Den Haag, for example
This is very subjective though, the average experience may be otherwise
Your points are very good though, and I think your last paragraph is spot on
>About the UK, having lived there I stand for my point

are way smaller than what you’s expect, and the massive relative weight of England’s population has meant that the differentiating feats that you may expect to find in Cornwall, Wales, Scotland
have deteriorated quite a bit
it's true that for their population the differences are pretty small
I'm also not an expert on the UK, i've been only 3 times and for a very short amount of time
Therefore, I take your Word
>The Sicily bit is also subjectively debatable
As a Leonese, I have felt much more alien in Sicily an in Den Haag, for example
I didn't expect that
Truth be told i haven't been in Sicily so i might have underestimated their alien
ness
i felt very much at home when in Italy, though i've only been to Veneto, Milan, Tuscany and Rome
As for the netherlands it's just so gloomy, wet, flat, buttery, serious, cold
even their cheese tastes different, nah i did feel It was different
In comparison going through Southern France feels weirdly familiar
And the balkans  i think that's the weirdest you can get in Europe, maybe thrace IS the most alien region, but the strangest i've been IS Albania
Unless you consider the caucasus, then they win by a lot
You are right about the differences in the UK being underestimated, though
We think about the UK being culturally almost monolithic and it’s not
However, these differences are more subtle than in other countries
Sicily, and generally most areas south of Rome, are a different animal
The difference with northern Italy may be even larger than the equivalent in Spain, for example
>The difference with northern Italy may be even larger than the equivalent in Spain, for example
I suppose, i've Heard calabrian
i thought It was romanian
It is not the norm in Spain
It would be rude to ask guests to do it
No, I don't thake them off but I'm still a civilised person
You don't really take off your shoes at the door here
When you get to your own home you usually do and wear slippers, but guests are not supposed to take off their shoes, unless they want to for any reason, or if for instance it's raining and their shoes are dirty
When I found out it was a thing people would do in the vast majority of other countried did it I was really weirded out
Yep
Only when there is a considerable degree of trust and yet it's usually the guests who politely ask to take of their shoes
Slippers exist
I got used to it in Japan
And you gotta admit it's way more hygienic
....Yes
Even if there were no guests It's not like guests shoes are usually dirty anyways
No, you do it with slippers
Hey from this post it seems that it's a Mediterranean vs non-Mediterranean thing, you should be in our side
Slippers exists lol
There's a middle ground between street shoes and barefoot
I live in a really humid climate
but anyway, I think the doormat doesn't clean all the germs and stuff that you get walking outside
Because you actually leave footprints if you're barefoot, even with socks
Some people do only wear socks, speacially if they have wooden floors
But here wooden floors are only common in apartments so if you live in a house, the floors will be ceramic tiles, which can get cold unless you have radiating floor
Most people don't usually have mud and if their shoes are dirty enough with mud that they can't clean them in the doormat, they'll be asked or will ask themselves to take them off
Tortilla de patata It's a dish of the poor but it's extremely popular with everyone

Yes
In fact, the Roman name for the Iberian peninsula, Hispania, literally means "Land of rabbits".
Not something you see often but it's easy to find it so I guess there's some demand, at least
I don't really pay that much attention to it but I'm pretty sure I see it often in the supermarket where I usually buy groceries
Fun fact: Traditional Valencian Paella has rabbit and chicken
It's not something prohibited, but not many people do it, even sparingly
Rabbits are consider to be pets in many countries, but yes, very similar in Spain
I lived in Venezuela, the situation was getting worse and worse and because me and my family have double nationality thanks to my grandfather who is Spanish we moved to Spain
The Venezuela of today is completely different from the Venezuela  of my childhood which still wasn’t nowhere near as good as my parents childhood
Born in South Africa
Got offered a role in Bahrain so sold up and moved
Lived there 3 years and then got offered a job in the U.K. Lived there 17 years and then they voted to leave the EU
I want my children growing up in the EU (FoM is hugely important, IMO) so we sold up and moved to Spain
Andorra and Spain
Geographically or architecturally as well
Similar in what other senses
I've never been to any of them but I find the statement surprising
In Spanish a lot of them make sense, from what I'm seeing comparing to other languages:
H: hidrógeno
O: oxígeno
N: nitrógeno
C: carbono
Cu: cobre (not that far off)
W: can be wolframio or tungsteno, I think all chemists understand if you say either of them
However there are a lot that don't make sense also:
K: potasio
Na: sodio
Au: oro
Ag: plata
Hg: mercurio
Sb: antimonio
Sn: estaño
Pb: plomo (knowing it comes from plumbum it's quite understandable, tho)
S: azufre (but the compounds are more related to S usually, like HS is sulfuro de hidrógeno)
(I think that most of the ones I did not name here make sense, but I may be forgetting something)
Sciences were mostly taught in Galician and because that's the language I still think them I'm going to do that comparison
Most are the same (Fe - Ferro) or can be mostly deduced (Sc - Escandio) but there are some notable exceptions:
* K - Potasio and Kr - Cripton
The "k" doesn't exist in Galician
* Y - Itrio
The "y" doesn't exist in Galician
* W - Volframio
The "w" doesn't exist in Galician
* Au - Ouro
* Ag - Plata
This one is easy if you think of Argentina and the Silver River
* Ge - Xermanio or Sg - Seaborxio
"G" and "j" many times get changed to "x".
* S - Xofre
* P - Fósforo
* Sb - Antimonio and Sn - Estaño.
* Hg - Mercurio
* Pb - Chumbo
More or less yes and no some yes others no for example NA cobre
But for example W wolframio
in spanish, at least from spain, we say wolframio, so it has sense :)
&#x200B;
usually they have sense
It depends on the Region
I think Catalan is widely spoken in Catalonia by people of all ages, but I have no idea about other regions apart from Valencia
In Valencia most young people I know can speak Valencian, but as any other learnt language, not really as their native language
However, some of them speak in Valencian with their parents and are fully bilingual
Valencian is most commonly used in small towns but in bigger cities (I've lived in Alicante, Elx and València) the usual language is Spanish
Valencian is used in signs and such, and you can speak in Valencian with people, but I've always seen it as secondary
Most people I know that wanted to master Valencian had to attend an academy, they weren't fully bilingual
However, I don't live there anymore except for July and August so maybe things have changed
Yes
Valencian (catalán) is very commonly used
Normally people are raised with it and uses it with their families and friends
In official matters Spanish is more commonly used
It's perfectly normal to switch between Spanish and valencian between people, and if someone has some troubles with the regional language, it's customary that every member of the conversation automatically switches to Spanish
Asturian is not very widespread but recently I would say t there have been an increase in people learning it, and the regional television channel takes effort in spreading it
However, even thought it isn't used in it's totality, there is a lot of people, specially in rural areas, who speak Asturian, and mostly everyone speaks a minimun of it limited mostly to certain words, gramatical expressions and fonetics
I'm not Galician but no one has wrote a comment about them, so I'll do it
I was pretty surprised to learn how univucous (edit: ubiquitous) Galician is in the autonomy
Over 80% of the population speak it, which puts it ahead of all other regional languages in Spain
As for the rest
Basque is around 30-50% (depending on the province); Catalan is over 70% in Catalonia and slightly higher in the Balearic Islands; Valencian is around 60% in the comunitat (I think) and finally, Aranés is spoken by around a third of the valley of Aran
In general the regional languages in Spain are doing great, way better than the rule (in Europe) due partly to a decentralised attitude to the problem and great regional effort
However, there's exceptions like aragones and asturleones, which are still at risk of extinction
Btw: Aranés is a dialect of occitan (a language spoken in southern France)
The valley where it's spoken is actually in the northern side of the pyrinees
Yes, Catalan is taught at school and people use it in the street even if they don't speak catalan at home
It's a language very much alive with a very active culture with regional television, radio, theatre, literature and music in Catalan
In some specific areas of the Barcelona province you may find people who don't talk Catalan, immigrants or children of, but most people after some time living here end up speaking in Catalan to some extent
Still the same in Elx and Alicante, only older people/families speak Valencian on a daily basis
I took the Valencian test a few years ago and it was terrible, it is so different from the Valencian I have been speaking since I was a kid
And shows the French disregard in keeping regional languages
Compare French and Spanish sides of the Basque Country, or Aranés, an Occitan language that it is going to survive better in Spain than in France
It's a mistake, I must have been pretty tired because I wanted to say ubiquitous which means a completely different thing
Univocal (and not univucous) means that the interpretation is unique
I hadn't used the word ever in English and I translated it wrong
In Spanish it's unívoco and not univocoso, that's why you didn't find anything,
Institutions are a result of the will of the people too
They are not established out of thin air
When they decided in 1978 to make a constitution that respected the rights of minority languages we colectively decided on protecting them, regardless what the stupid morons of Vox or the PP would think
The attitudes and those political structures in those areas where they speak Catalan, Basque or Galician wouldn't allow for the imposition of Spanish the same way that French was imposed
Don Claudio Moyano, creator of the Moyano Law, making elementary education free and mandatory
[Canovas] brought political stability to Spain in the 19th century after almost an entire century of inner struggles, civil wars, coups and such
With hindsight we look down on his political two-party system and the political clientelism at the time as if that was an exclusively Spanish thing that only happened at that time, as if we completelly left behind those type of practices
But still, it brought peace to Spain for many decades, with all its faults and downsides

I live in Barcelona, Spain
The restaurant scene is pretty good, I only find the Asian restaurants a bit lacking, and I'm continuously looking for a great Indian place
I lived in London before and the South Asian food there is out of this world
Barcelona, however, does have some good Mexican Tex-Mex food, and lots of South American cuisines that I have not tried yet
In my own sloppy translation:
-From Don Quixote:

"Poesía eres tú" de Becquer

>"Poetry is you" (used the weird order because in Spanish the order is also changed to a lyrical version not used normally)
"Vivo sin vivir en mí" de Maria Teresa de Jesús.
>"I live not within myself" (meaning not enjoying life/not having rest)
Darío, with a "D", just as "Don Quixote", so, close enough
I think our group is alright, however we can’t trust it because both Sweden and Poland have a good team that can mess up our chances
The group isn't bad but I would like to Spain to get whipped so hard they have to fire everyone in the Federation because of the shady things they do
On a side note, someone please explain to me how the English get blinded when they talk about football and always think they have the best chances to win
The official name in Spanish is the latin name, "et" which is the conjunction "and" in latin and also the origin of the ampersand symbol (& is just an e and a t mashed together)
But outside programming it's barelly used in Spanish, we use conjunction "y". Most people will use the English name
On the other hand, even though Spanish doesn't have a specific word for the **ampersand**, we do at least have one for the "**@**" symbol
_Por otra parte, aunque en español no tengamos una palabra concreta para el símbolo "**&**", al menos sí que tenemos una para la **arroba**._
>(similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)
We have it in Spanish keyboards for Spain (it's the second keyboard, on the "3" key on the number bar) and it's not a symbol we use
I thought for a second that you called carets esperluettes lol
We use all vowels except *i* but we use *y* (which technically we don't consider a vowel):
- *a* is a preposition, generally meaning "to".
- *e* and *y* means "and". *E* is only used when the following syllable is stressed and begins with an *i* sound
- *o* and *u* means "or". Same explanation than before for *u*.
Catalonian does use *i*, instead of *y*, meaning "and".
Yeah, it's normal, it's not really a common name
Most people, at least in Spain, will say something like "that thing that looks like an eight that means 'and'" before saying "et".
No se, la RAE no tiene dudas respecto al nombre del símbolo, ¿de dónde es esa cita
Alguna duda sí que tiene la RAE, teniendo en cuenta que ni en su [entrada para "et"] ni en la [entrada de "y^(2)"] a la que redirige menciona en ningún momento el símbolo "&". Por el contrario, en [su entrada para "arroba"] sí que reconoce su uso para el símbolo "@".
This right here
Depending on which keyboard I use (fun fact there are quite a few US English keyboards not only one) those keys will do one thing or the other
Personally I use US English International with Alt Gr, best one if you type in several different European languages
And for programming I use US English (the standard QWERT one)
Maybe I'm wrong but I think there are more Greek speakers than Catalan speakers
So it looks like a dick move towards the greeks
Yeah I think those are pretty common in most Slavic languages
Russian for instance, has the exact same ones
Funnily enough, ни too
La arroba se usa frecuentemente, & practicamente no la usa nadie a no ser que sea programador
¿Por que no se usa
Por que y no se puede acortar mas, es un unico caracter en ingles la conjuncion es "and" (3 caracteres) y la acortan a uno usando &

The king wanted a city without a cathedral so the church had no power
So he chose madrid because it was in the center of everything
To be more specific for anyone who wants to learn more:
Toledo seemed like the obvious choice because it was more or less in the centre and was alongside Seville the most important city of Castile
But it was also the seat of the archbishopric of Toledo, that happened to have the "primacy of the Spains", which meant that it was the highest ecclesiastical authority in all of the peninsula
Many high noble families had their lands and seat in Toledo and their surroundings
That includes powerful and old families like the Alvarez de Toledo (which might remind fellow Spaniards to a certain conservative politician)
As nanimo said, Phillip II didn't want competition over the control of the capital
Madrid was near Toledo, it was more centrical, it wasn't the seat of any bishop and there were no important noble families
It was known to the kings because the Cortes of Castile have met there a few times for those same reasons
Basically, Madrid was chosen because it was known to be an unimportant centrical town
It also had a castle or Alcazar, that was expanded to become the royal residence
It was located were the current Royal Palace stands, but it burnt out in a big fire in the 1700s.
I would guess sticking it up to the Papacy in the 1870s also played a role (gee how could you claim a state when your seat is our capital)
I like your Álvarez de Toledo reference and I didn't know abut it, thanks
Well i mean in new spain it was different
Much bigger territory, very sparcely populated
They did good taking advantage of already built infraestructure of the aztecs
But afaik during that time London remained the biggest and wealthiest city because of its port
Sí, Cayetana es de una de ls familias de más rancio abolengo de España. Comparable con los duques de Alba
Wasn't there any backlash when the Habsburgs decided to stay at Wien and handle all power from that city in the margins of the empire
Sabía que era rancia pero no el nivel al que se remonta la ranciedad de su familia
Me ha entrado curiosidad y lo estoy buscando ahora y parece que tienen su origen como alcaldes de Toledo en el siglo XII
La rama principal de hecho es la que fundó el ducado de Alba y el famoso Duque de Alba del siglo XVI era un Álvarez
La rama principal se extinguió cuando murió sin hijos la duquesa de Alba de los cuadros de Goya y heredó el sobrino, de la familia actual de los Fitz-James Stuart (de origen inglés)
Cayetana es la cabeza de una de las 17 ramas secundarias (wtf), que tienen distintos ducados, condados y marquesados
In spain we say "no me importa" for the simple "I don't care", however we also use "ni lo sé ni me importa" which means "I don't know nor care".
Using swear words we have many expressions:
"Me importa una mierda" or "Me importa un carajo" - "I don't give a shit/dick"
"Me importa tres cojones" - "I don't give 3 balls" (as in testicles)
"Me suda la polla" - "It sweats off my dick" or simply "me la suda" implying the dick part
There is also "Me la trae al pairo" and I just learned it's origin: "pairar" means setting a boat in a position balancing the water current and the wind so it just stands still, so it means that the hearing of whatever they told you doesn't alter you a bit, you don't care
Me la bufa, me la suda, me la trae al pairo, me la come, me la chupa, me la repanpinfla, me importa una mierda, me importa tres cojones, sudo de ello, etc
Honestly i don't even know whats the meaning of some of the words but in spanish everything is made off swear words, and everything can be used for swearing
" Me la pela " CATALAN
"me la suda" SPANISH
The first one doesn't have meaning itself and the second one is like "you're sweating of it"
Another very commonly used is "me da igual" that roughly would translate to the English expression "It's all the same to me".
Spanish is very rich in this kind of expressions about not giving a shit
Como si te la pica un pollo
Other common variation: me la pela/me la trae floja
More classical expressions: me importa un bledo/pito/pimiento/comino
"Me importa/no me importa un/tres pepino" - "I care/I don't care a/three cucumber".
"Me importa/no me importa una mierda" - "I care/I don't care a shit"
There’s also “Me importa entre cero y nada” which would translate to “I care between cero and nothing”
Oh, I forgot
Love that one <3
To put it in context, it's used when someone tells you something about him that you don't care at all you can reply "por mí como si te la pica un pollo" and it could be roughly translated as "for me as if a chicken bites you(r dick)" the dick part is again implied
For what is worth, it's perfectly possible to hear (from women) the expression "Me suda el coño" (It sweats off my cunt) instead of "Me suda la polla"
Thanks for explaining :)

Because you are probably way richer than most of the other people living in Spain, no one will feel sorry because you are not oppressed, it has at most 50% of support in your own region, and spain has been developing Catalonia and Basques as economic and industrial centres for a long time, and when it goes better for you than the rest because of that you think better to keep the good stuff and leave
I think that's not how it works, feels like a treason, backstab direct to the heart
Greetings from the poorest region of Spain, Cádiz, where we work more time for less money and live happily feeling the privilege of living in a developed country
What does one thing have to do with the other
In any case, who says they don't support a "peaceful democratic" process
There just haven't been one
The former attempts were illegal, therefore not democratic, therefore not supported
In any case, Spain is a very important member in the EU
They won't risk pissing us off "just" for a region which is about 50% pro-independence and 50% pro-unity
And these numbers can sway quick
Rembember these things are highly politicized and public opinion is easily manipulated by media
Thank you
Some uninformed internet people just read the words "peaceful" and "democratic" and go at our throats as if we were evil oppressors for not letting a happy hippy peaceful democratic independence
As if the situation was that easy and categorically simple
Yeah, reality is far from that
> To me it looks less like "Catalonia wants independence" and more like "some Catalonians want independence, no matter what the rest of them think".
We'll never know, because Spain and its European allies don't support a peaceful democratic process to decide it
> Because Catalonians aren't oppressed in any way comparable to people in some countries in the Middle East
It's completely insane to pretend Catalonians have it as bad as Libyans under Khaddafi or Syrians under Assad for example
Yeah, who cares about [arbitrary detentions] and [a few hundreds of injured people] without legal consequences
Let's set a threshold comfortable enough to avoid inconveniences to our allies
> As soon as the Spanish Prime Minister orders a deadly poison gas attack against Barcelona, Europe will support independence of Catalonia, I'm sure of it
LMAO
50% /  50% It changes a lot depending on what the central government does
Support for independence is currently at 44% [according to official polls]
Catalan is also the adjective and the name for people living in Catalonia
I agree
That wording is questionable bordering on dishonest
I mean, while I agree that the 1O was totally disgusting, the Yes won because most of the people that do not want the independence didn't vote
And the 12 politicians are in prison because they broke the law, not just because they "allowed people to vote". Everyone knew that was going to happen (Catalan parliament lawyers specifically said it multiple times), and they did it anyways So they got what everyone told them they would get
I'm not contrary to another referendum, but it has to be a legal referèndum, not that "thing" that was 1O and the previous one

Actually, that’s the part Catalans keep out of conversations: they don’t want EVERYONE to vote, because if the whole country had to vote on this topic, the majority would vote for Catalonia to stay in Spain
The reason the vote was prohibited by Spain’s highest court, is because they couldn’t allow a referendum on something that would breach other Spaniards’ constitutional rights
We Spaniards all have the right to the land of Spain
If A part of the country would want to break apart, they would need the constitution to be changed, and for that you need a majority of all Spaniards
It was an illegal referendum, the president told Catalans to not vote at all
> The high court of Catalonia ruled the elections illegal too
There's a unified judicial system in Spain with multiple seats across the Spanish territory, including Catalonia
What you call "the rule of the high court of Catalonia" is nothing else than a decision coming from Spain itself
> EU countries tend to support the rule of law in other EU countries
If a peaceful democratic process is in violation of the law, the rule of law is preferred, since the laws themselves are seen as the product of legitime peaceful democratic process
You're totally right
That's why Catalonia tried it by its own limited means and it didn't work
And that's why I was asking a for legal peaceful democratic process favored by Spain and with the international pressure of its neighbors if needed
So that's basically your argument against a UN report denouncing how Spain is contravening several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
We can know with a margin of error
People voting is not the only way to know people's support on different things
Read [my explanation] tldr; "mandatory voting" is  showing up, not actually voting
disclaimer: not aussie
What you say sounds fair, but we already have a solution for that
It's called "Elecciones Generales". It's the country-wide election where we vote people in that decide on country-wide policy
There is no need for a person of Madrid to decide on de healthcare, education or roads of people in the Canary Islands
What we non-Catalans are defending is the right to Catalonia's land
We can freely move/work there and the separatists would take that away from us, without changing the constitution first
> Doesn't Spain have independent judicial branch
Well, not really according to the Council of Europe
[[1]] [[2]] [[3]] And the public perception is even worse
[[1]] (sorry, source in Spanish only, you can find a rough translation [here]
> it is not the role of governments, who state they respect the rule of law, to endorse civil disobedience and civil unrest in their democratic allied countries
I've explicitly talked in my previous comment about encouraging a legal referendum, not civil disobedience
I'm a bit "eh" on the idea
I know a lot of voters that have really strong ideas and know a bit of the politics but, at the end of the day, they forget or just end up not voting
On the other side, a lot of elders would have to go and probably have their vote chosen for them
Well, it is I guess
Having someone have to show up drastically increases the change of voting, but it's not a 100% change anyways
I don't know if this counts, but in Reddit I get that "¿Dónde está la biblioteca

"Usted" (polite version of "you") started declining its use in Spain in the last decades of the 20th century and everyone uses "Tú" instead except in specific situations
In mainland spain "usted" is seen as too respectful or old fashioned, while its still pretty common in latinamerica
Spaniards might seem rude or too direct to latinos because of this
We also dont say "Gracias" (thank you) for everything as commonly as brits for instance
When someone called me Fräulein or Señorita it meant I was in trouble
But for them Ustedes is not formal
They don't use Vosotros so Ustedes is both formal and informal for them
Oh, god
I really hate talking to my SAm
friends, because afterwards, I tend to use “usted” and “vos” a lot more than I’d like
People give me a pass with vos, but the looks I get when I accidentally use usted
Where
I don't know any Latin American country where Vosotros is used
I guess with -ito/-ita, that's how you make diminutives
So Juan --> Juanito, although we have specific ones for names:
Juan --->Pepe
Francisco---> Paco
Jesús---> Chus

In my area uo north, we do diminutives with-in:
Tomás---> Tomasín and the likes

Good
who voted against this
Is this a real problem
Normally you buy a phone and get a cable with it you need
The last 4-5 phones I owned all had the same cable but I always used the the one that came with the phone
I just don't think we need a regulation for this
No cable
I don't have any cable that I don't need
My phone is almost 3 years old and the cable is about to snap
I have 3 cables and adapters and sometimes they aren't enough
Not bringing a cable and adapter with phone would be a big nono for me
My parents get by with only one cable and adapter for their phone and tablet so I guess it depends on the person
>1) packaging a proprietary cable to millions of device no matter if it gets used or not
This already happens I have a Samsung, my brother a Huawei we use the same cable
Apple is shit anyway and they have a huge retention rate (92%), also 70% won't consider other brand
>2) you buy the cable that you need 1 or 2 times
What cable do you need two times
You use it every day for years
>If you want to argue about you are getting scammed for the cable, because it no longer is in the package and you still pay the same, fuck yes
So be it
It is an 3 $ article
But please see these cables rolled out to a million times, they are just producing garbage
Try to get away from your 3$ problem and see the larger picture
A fast charging adpater+cable costs about 35€ on the official site
I stand with what I said: this vote was unnecessary because nobody has a problem when buying a new phone having to switch cables
Good old USB type A.
But they voted for everybody making the same cable; which, mostly, they already did
This has nothing to do with the amount of cables you have
Manufacturers are still going to produce the same amount of cables they do now because people need them
If you are hoarding cables at home that you don't use is because of an old phone not one you brought today
Having tons of cables isn't a thing people do now
ETA: If you don't want the cable and adapter that comes with your phone just ask your friends if they want it or put it on ebay for free
Are you 60
You have multiple devices you need multiple cables
Those **cables already have the same port** but you still need more than one

Are really that much of a "straw need"?
I haven't used a straw for more than a decade
Drink it from the cup, it's not that difficult
I got a pasta straw a few months back in an iced coffee from a cafe in Berlin
Never had seen it before
Ok, these are my conclusions:
-Lots of people who drink so much soda that their teeth are dying
-People how *need* to multitask everything, thus spill their drink all over the place
-People who doesn't like the cream moustache, wtf guys
That's like the number 1 reason to take that kind of drinks
-Lots of bearded men without hankies, like a lot of them
-Disabled people, this I understand
-And the honour place for the unmentioned, the astronauts, those I forgive for using straws
The thing is that for most of that cases the change in behaviour is the better solution in every aspect
Also it's difficult depending on the behaviour and the person
For instance I quit sodas when I was 18yo, and haven't drink any for a decade now, easiest thing ever, don't miss them at all
But I cannot freaking sit in a good posture not for all the gold in the world, I tried for decades but it's impossible for me
Any person have their weaknesses and their strengths
But the thing is that everyone should at least TRY to change a harmful behaviour, if it's too hard to change then we can talk about the complex solutions, but most people don't even try

I dislike referendums because I see them as a trick used by politicians to reduce a complex problem into a false dichotomy
But the entire point of electing a political class is, precisely, that complex issues must be resolved by talks based on nuances
At the very least, referendums should be done using multiple transferable vote and a variety of options, reflecting the most common positions of the population
As always, the one posing the question has a huge advantage, but with multiple options that influence is reduced
Shut Up you wanted the fish and were going yo give you the fish sooner or later ****

>This paper updates estimates of fossil fuel subsidies, defined as fuel consumption times the
gap between existing and efficient prices (i.e., prices warranted by supply costs, environmental
costs, and revenue considerations)
The idea that it's a subsidy to not add the environmental cost when there's really not much agreement to what that cost should be and then just state the absolute number they come up with as fact seems dubious at best
I agree there should be a carbon tax but the ideas of what the real externality cost is vary by orders of magnitude

To give you an example of how far Spain is of having affordable train tickets, it's usually cheaper to drive a car and park in the destination for one person than to take a train and then use public transport in the destination city for that same person
There is so much to be changed in this matter
EU is already trying to do that, but it's really tricky to manage lines between countries, cause differences in interest and sharing of costs
Also  many countries have national train companies and they want to 'protect' their business
I live in London and going to Paris by flight is cheaper than train, it's absurd
I love trains and I love arriving straight into the city rather than having to take shuttles to and from the airport
If tickets were the same or less, I would go by train 100% of the time

Votes, share and turnout in the last 10 years of presidential (Pres
), and parliamentary (Parl
) elections²:
- 2012 Parl
: 165,380 votes (45
60%, 70
56% turnout)
- 2013 Pres
: 161,940 votes (51
21%, 63,90% turnout)
- 2016 Parl
: 158,490 votes (41
41%, 73
33% turnout)
- 2018 Pres
: 180,272 votes (53
90%, 63,92% turnout)
- 2020 Parl
: 142,956 votes¹ (34
8%, 75
9% turnout)
*¹ Votes estimated based on preliminary results
*² The results are just the ones for the ECG and their candidates, not taking into account allies or who is the candidate
Looks like turnout was not essential this time, but the loss of more than 15k votes (~9
8% of the party's support in 2016)
Turnout helped, but it was "just" following the trend, and probably wouldn't have been enough if the ECG had kept it's share of votes
Edit: apparently their allies got only 3 of the 7 representatives lost by the ECG and the Croatian minority, so (if I'm reading the alliances right) those 4 representatives won by the sum of the opposition parties at the expense of the government coalition are the actual key to the possibility of a new majority
So, again, turnout has helped but apparently the key was the change of behaviour in the ECG 2016 voters; either switching to the opposition, not voting or changing parties inside the government coalition (final data would be needed to analyse exactly what happened)
One step closer towards a brighter future
Turnout in 2016 was 388,220 [according to DIK] so it's an increment of around 22,500, not 80/90,000
He was just saying that turnout was not the key factor, but a big loss of supporters

Some of the things he's immediately planning on doing upon resuming office
> He will rejoin the Paris climate accords, according to those close to his campaign and commitments he has made in recent months, and he will reverse President Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization
He will repeal the ban on almost all travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and he will reinstate the program allowing “dreamers,” who were brought to the United States illegally as children, to remain in the country, according to people familiar with his plans
Hopefully this is the first step towards more cooperation between US and us
Hope this new president don't start a war too
Even though I'm glad that the US will have a better president now, I still think that we need to be way more independent from the US
Americans could choose another candidate like Trump and we'll be back in no time to the last 4 years
When dictatorships like Russia or Belarus claim your election is "a mockery to democracy" you know you had a fair election

Still better than Trump
Puerto Rico, despite the skewed results of the consultations, doesn't have a particularly high interest in becoming a state, nor in my opinion should it
The status quo works relatively well, even with its flaws, and so it is not about to have a voice in election results in the US

For me it is crazy that Boris Johnson can be elected as PM without an explicit vote on the Parliament, just because it is the new leader of the most voted party
True, but Johnson hasn't been elected by the MPs, just the members of his party
As far as I know, he hasn't been approved by the Parliament, which for me it's quite shocking
He is the PM because he is the new leader of the party
This, no one elected May either
People elected the Tories AND the Tories elected May
I don't agree
He was elected as MP, but the Parliament did not vote on him as PM
I have learnt that this is apparently the UK way of doing things, but for me it is profoundly undemocratic way, as the message is that the party, and not the parliament, is the best representation of the will of the people, which is not
People voted MPs, most of which had no saying in who the new PM is
That is not being democratically elected as PM, in my opinion, even if it's the law

That’s not a robust system
That’s a system ready to be cooped by a more more ambitious and politically savvy authoritarian
It’s even more crazier when you realize that he lost the popular vote twice and yet got to be president once because of like less than 1% of the vote in a few states and it could have happened again had less than 1% swung the other way
There are so many things wrong with the US system with the biggest being it’s inability to respond to changes to make it’s system more democratic
Well, I think that they think of it as extremely dysfunctional as a system since they also have a system that's just as hectic
Part of the inability to modify the us political system is that too many Americans excessively rely on what they think the US system was intended to be like rather than adapting to changes
Americans mythologize the independence era way too much and are stuck partially in the past
This is a false equivalency and you know it
I don’t think the reluctance is about unintended consequences
It’s not working right now so that’s clearly not it
I think it’s simply plain old conservatism in that it’s a reluctance to change a system or part of a system because that’s how it’s always been
The most resilient countries are the ones that know when it’s time to reform their systems while the dysfunctional ones keep doing things the way they’ve always been
The US is the latter right now while a country like New Zeland would be the former
They revamped their electoral system in the 90s because it also used to be dysfunctional
Instead of talking about the issue that I raised which is a serious one, you take it personally and then start talking about something else completely
Right now it seems to be along ideological lines, if I had to choose between popular votes deciding an election or a small number of states deciding an election, I’d go with the former since it’s more democratic
If Americans keep having elections where the winner goes to the loser of the popular vote then it’s going to start to be seen as illegitimate
That’s fine if there’s a will to change it, but that probably won’t happen given how polarized the US is
When systems are rigid and people view them as illegitimate then you run into all sorts of issues
See Spain for example

Sorry for that, but r/turkey has been mobilized like crazy, pushing a lot of agendas and brigading, so people are on the defensive about anyone with the turkey flair and assume they support the invasion
The invasion was unfounded and a big backstabbing considering that turkey and USA got SDF to destroy most border defenses a month to 2 weeks before the attack started in order for USA to stay protecting them, and for Erdogan to deescalate
Also turkey used those USA-turkey good will patrols to inspect all the border and prepare the invasion

I have seen the scene many times and I find it amusing every time
I won't say the name of the place so people is not aware of just one place
You are not wrong
Actually, liberal (orange) parties aren't conservative
They are liberal progressives (En Marche, Ciudadanos, etc
They usually are in the European coalition ALDE
The conservative parties are the blue ones (People's Party, Tories, CDU, etc
do all americans state their opinions this way
\>What I, an American, thinks about peanut butter jelly
Spain says hi
Our political parties are still new to this
It will take a decade or hopefully less until they realize they have to swallow their pride and make pacts
In Spain, PP uses blue; in UK, Tories use blue; in France, the Republicans use blue
The European People's Party uses blue
I see a common trend in conservatives using blue, liberals using yellow/orange and social democrats using red
i see
Yeah, that's what I consider myself

Damn, we need some more people here in Spain
North Africa has a large population on its coast
Nah, is just a bunch of people waiting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to live in Europe
(Sorry for the bad joke)
We call it España Vaciada (Emptied Spain) as there's basically no industry but tourism and so everyone in those white areas have just left in the past 50 years or so
Madrid is a very lonely metropolis
Some argue that the entire planet should be covered by a very dense city
But the country I live in is one of the few countries with higher population density than England and the Netherlands
In particular, the population of the urban area I live in is 25 million, but not suffered much damage from the corona pandemic yet
Being friends with the US doesn’t mean we become Americans
We need them, they have the biggest economy, they are our strongest defensive ally, and they ideologically align with us on many things
It’s also great when their president sees that US needs Europe as well
Poland’s got the right idea
I don't think that's his office

WTF title
auschwitz express
in spain, the incumbent minority socialist govt passed a random resolution to move franco's dead body to a less prominent location (44 years after his death, and having controlled govt 25+ of these democracy years)
nobody really gave a shit about franco, but this calculated political move stoked fires with the conservative voters
the result was that 10% of voters backed the openly fascist vox party in the general election
the conservative pp party now has less than half the voters as last election, in great part due to seeming likely to pact with vox after the andalucia regional election earlier this year
some of those votes went to the newer smaller centre-right ciutadans party, but mostly it was voters prioritising voting the other big party (psoe over pp) to show that they are against fascism (prioritising political sentiment over psoe's horrendous economic mismanagement during the crisis of 2008-2011)
i switched from pp to vote ciutadans, (because the new leader started talking about abortion and irrelevant shit, and because in my region catalunya, pp was losing seats to ciutadans already and i didn't want to make my vote useless)
first i regretted switching, because the result made it evident that psoe will be propped to power by ciutadans
but now i think, at least the budget will be passed on time, and perhaps the anti-franco general sentiment was more important to spain as a whole
even if this was dirty politics, and psoe are already unnerving central bank projections of a new recession and unemployment rising after 6 years of decline, perhaps a dwindling centre right propped by fascists would lead to an uglier future
thing is, fascism was never actually defeated in spain
once franco died, his chosen heir returning power to the crown decided instead to start a constitutional monarchy
in the age of extremists and nationalists, so many have forgotten that our democracy started with the biggest (and most welcome) compromise between past bitter rivals (fascists, republicans, communists, and centrists of all colours)
the entry into the eu in 1986 and especially the olympicsf 92, are *still* tear-jerking events of our history, like returning to civilisation and freedom
i don't remember where i was going with this and now it's too long and i'm sorry
thanks
also wanted to add, other than fascists, the pact with ciutadans will also escape psoe seeking support from nationalists in catalunya
the secessionist camp has been declining since "referendum", but there was a chance of a real referendum happening here if sanchez wanted power with a minority govt
i was surprised at the market rise the following monday, but i think that that's what it was about: budget pass, no fascist regression, no catalan secession
I love how this is what ends ups in the internet, and not the hundreds of giant snow dicks distributed by Madrid
It might not be as common as other countries but it snows plenty on Spain tho
Lots of mountains
You dont understand, the last time it snowed like this was more than 100 years ago
It snows a bit every year, and every 5 years or so there is a reasonably big snow storm, but this one was a first for everyone in Madrid
I seriously doubt I'll ever again see something like this here
sir i’m in this picture and I don’t like it
50 cm of heavy snow would cripple any decent sized city in Spain
Yeah, lots of mountain town have that sort of snow, but hardly in population centers
FREUDE
Olé olé olé.
I don't have the numbers but, man, the Wikipedia blackout informed A LOT of people who are usually oblivious/ do not care about these stories
Most of the people I know learnt about what Article 13 was because Wikipedia in Spanish went black
And it was quite easy to contact your representatives with the website that they provided
I tried 4 times but all the lines were collapsed
Hopefully, full of people yelling at them
GG WP
wow, I didnt belive they would stop it, makes me happy
Americans and their memes "hurr EU is gonna ban memes"
I guess they are too used to one block controlling the cameras and a dictator-like president
I don't know but I feel like after today Articles 11 and 13 are going to be deleted or at least changed
The website has collapsed
Too many people looking for the MEPs that they should yell at
We know, but sometimes you need to simplify the message to get it across and the explain it in more detail
Honestly i liked much more Trump´s gestures and talk about models: [
I remember that when the Corona virus broke out in Italy, the European Union's rulers decided to keep the border open
Let's rather unify Europe
Yes, found that funny too

Same in Spain :(
Interesting you totally ignore Lithuanian Jews in this
I'm sure they thought "both sides are just as bad" when they were lined up to be shot and buried in mass graves by Nazis and their collaborators
poor europe
Praising the rethorics of someone doesn't mean to agree with his views
For example, Lenin, he delivered good speeches though he was a mass murderer
From an historical point of view I understand some people in Poland and other eastern Europe countries to be pissed about the non aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the soviets
But here in Spain we lived a whole different story
Here the liberal powers of Europe (France, UK
etc), where in a non aggression pact with Germany and Italy when fascisms invaded us
And the soviet union was the only country which fought with us against fascism
Once WW2 ended we were in the liberal zone of influence, and they pacted with our fascist dictator so we never got democracy until he died in 1977
So while I can understand the point of view of eastern countries, we (Spain and Portugal) are also part of Europe and part of the European union
And I refuse that history only get taught one way, what happened to us, and the non-aggression policies that let our people be conquered and genocided by fascism should also be known
Also we honor the people who did come to fight with us, the brave International Brigades, composed of communists from all over the world
I would never let anyone dishonour those who gave their live against fascism for the freedom of a country they didnt even belong, and even if they could get in troubles with their own government for coming
How is the hammer and sickle the symbol of Stalinism
"sTaLiN dId NoThInG wRoNg"
Did you know how many social advances do we have thanks to communist and socialist
40 hour weeks
Weekends
Paid vacations
Universal healthcare
Minimum wage
Gender equality laws
For god's sake, even in my country same-sex marriage was achieved by commies and socialist
Please look beyond the neoliberal brainwash that want to take all those rights from us, and don't follow their stupid games
Never be ashamed of defend the working class
Never ashamed of defending labor right
Never ashamed of defending human dignity
Never in the same side as greedy, blood thirsty corporations
Never on the same side as racism, homophobia or sexism
Yeah he only killed like what, 50 million to achieve that
Plus the +100M soldiers who were treated like cattle and died in WW2
Truly a hero
Just the exact amount that you are going to ignore the billions of people killed by the regime you support (capitalism)
For every capitalist death you ignore I would ignore one communist death
Deal
Before you answer you should remember that European capitalist power that are not "banned" in this post still had African an Asian colonies during that time
I just ask that we should be fair, communist should be compared with capitalism, not with fascism (totally different thing)
When the socialist and communist returned to Spain in the 80s they won the elections, and Spain become one of the most progressive countries in Europe in social matters (same sex marriage, gender equality laws etc
Less that the carbon footprint reduced by the billions of innocent people killed by capitalism and liberalism
Much less
Capitalism is the economic system that have killed most people in human history
But ey
, let's not take out the right of a rich guy of having slaves, that's communism and it's evil
So yes, you're just going to ignore millions of people who died under Stalin's regime
edit: btw, if you want to seriously compare communism with capitalism with actual data I recomend you Hans Rosling work
Check the effect of [the introduction of capitalism in different regions in different times]
Communism is a while spectrum of ideologies and presenting it as a unique bloc is counter to discussion
While I respect that opinion (because they did so much harm), I think they did so many good things, you know like the GLOBAL campaign for smallpox vaccination in which they sent thousands of vaccines all over the world
Anyway I'm not here to talk about the Soviet Union, nor Stalin
I'm here to talk about communism and socialism
And this current of banning those ideologies in Europe
Of course as a member of a political party member of the GUE/NGL, that only seeks a better life for everyone in Europe I'm afraid for political prosecution out of this tendency
Then you admit that you ignore the death of the capitalist regimens
I you don't ignore those inocent people deaths I won't ignore those killed by Stalin
It's you call men, do the right one
Santiago Carrillo fought in the 1936 and we was leader of the communist party when they were allowed to return in 1978
Spanish communism has always been very progressive overall
Anyway I'm not here to talk about interwar period
I'm here to talk about communism and socialism
And this current of banning those ideologies in Europe
Of course as a member of a political party member of the GUE/NGL, that only seeks a better life for everyone in Europe I'm afraid for political prosecution out of this tendency
Lmao you should really stop talking about something you know nothing about
You don't even know who Santiago Carrillo was
He fought on the Civil War and in 1978 was the leader of the communist party in the elections
So yes, they kind of were the same
I never mention Stalin, I never generalized with "all of something did something". But whatever makes you happy men ;)
As Goebbels said, "accuse your adversary of doing what you are doing, that creates confusion".
I'm just saying that if we count all crimes done under a communist regime we should take account of all crimes done under capitalist regimes
Althought I prefer that while not forgetting the past we should talk about what capitalists and communist are defending nowadays in Europe, and I assure that none of we both defend those crimes
(Of course from my point of view capitalist defend modern slavery, but it's obviously different of when they just took black people in Africa into a boat)
We poor people will never see others than classical/gothic

We are used to stronger earthquakes here, but this reminded me of the 2017 7
1 magnitude earthquake we had, happened on the exact same day of the previous most destructive 1985 8
5 magnitude earthquake, September the 19th
I’m hoping for a quick recovery for all of Croatia
It’s scary
Can we cancel 2020
So Europe is left handed

This is unprofessional but it’s TRUE
US could have stopped it dead on its tracks but no testing available until very recent
Large population can’t afford to go to get treatment and hospitals are already understaffed
The pandemic only reinforces how fragile the system is in the US
If diabetes, heart disease, and cancer were contagious the U.S. would either have the best healthcare system in the world or everyone would be dead
Hopefully US learns after this that being sick is not an individual’s problem but the society as a whole
I would honestly consider the WW2 as two different "main" conflicts
* Germany vs Russia scenario in Europe
* USA vs Japan scenario in the Pacific
* Series of smaller conflicts and battles
I know this will offend many americans and brits, but if you put it into perspective, Battle of Stalingrad is still the bloodiest battle EVER fought, and nearly the same people died in that single battle than in the entire western front
The eastern front also has [the biggest tank battle] in history
&#x200B;
What the Western Front might have is the biggest air battles, with the Battle of Britain and the lesser known Battle of France
People downplay the french army, but they managed to take down more german fighters in the Battle of France than brits did in the Battle of Britain, and keep in mind that the french had WW1 tactics against german tactics that literally no one except the poles ever fought against
Well, this is true
But don't forget USA contributed the most to mantain West Europe safe from USSR, which is a relief
Germany vs Russia plus a series of smaller conflicts
Spanish civil war, the invasion of poland and france, the winter war in Finland, the battle of britain
Sounds more like young people rebelling against their parents anti-american stance
No wonder theres so many McDonalds in a supposed "Anti-america" country
Also young people are gullible, and pop culture from USA is very easy to sell
The fact that one A3 is two A4 and one A2 is two A3 and so on makes life so much easier than trying to figure out the same with US letters, etc
I had to reprint a poster for a conference in the US and they were not using DIN standards

"Based on english language searches". Maybe Spain/Portugal should worry about what the brits are searching while on vacation
So, the conclusion I reach is that Spain and Portugal finally have reached a point where an Iberian Union has plenty of advantages

I pity our northern european bros that have no AC because it rarely gets this hot
Madrid melts every summer but most (modern) houses have AC
Enjoy being Spanish for a summer
But you have to taste at least once Madrid's summer nights (above 30°)
Fucking disgusting, i cant even go out
Roght now im in milan, but im flying tonight to mallorca and lets see if its the same shit
Madrid has been like living in actual hell flames this July
So if you are thinking this place in North West Spain with a max of 18
2 is blessed, I tell you we are actually kinda pissed off seeing everyone else at the beach
Today it was better in Northern Spain
It was very hot during the day but now in the evening, it's cooler
Plus since it's dryer an evaporative cooler works well
Bad idea
Just saying
Probably the same group that builds those siderosds and parks are also building garajes under other name
The **paradox of tolerance** states that if a society is [tolerant] without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant
[Karl Popper] described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that "In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance
" Popper expands upon this, writing, "I do not imply for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would be most unwise
But we should claim the *right* to suppress them if necessary even by force
France represents all of us who believe in freedom
French people should be proud of living in a country that defends the values that our societies should be built upon

Also Madrid
I live in the mountains that you see in the background
From there, the towers look like an UFO power plug or something like that
I really miss the flat horizon
At night are worse
Madrid deserves to be called the most beautiful city in the world
Ì can't tell if the photo is shopped
The mountains in this photo look like the alps
None of the mountains in here have a high enough elevation to have rocky tops devoid of trees
The mountains are not visible this clearly from the Four Towers either since they run southwest to northeast in a semi-circle in the northern half of the region
The towers on the other hand are in the north eastern edge of the city center
There are still kilometers of city and other feeder cities before you get to the mountains
The birds also look really big
It's not  so bad once you get to plaza castilla and the new development should help

It feels weird in both ways
When I have been working in Finland during winter I feel like going to bed at 22:00 and at 16:00 I cannot believe we still have one hour more to work when it has been dark for so long
In summer: "I should go to bed, but I am not tired
What do you mean it is 2:30
". I cannot go to bed before 1 or 2 in the morning because my body is not yet ready to sleep

I love that meme
It is actually a thing, I have been in Rome like four times now, and most ppl just say espresso or, 'buon giorno, un capuccio, prego', and I really love how talkative they are
But sometimes, and I mean often appears somebody that has to chat with the barman for two minutes to ask for a coffee and a pastry
In Spain we have (disregarding bad coffee) a lot of times of coffee but it is just like pim-pam
Get a place and shout "cortado y con leche
Sacarina please

I like that you tried to imitate the style as close as possible
I am all for new takes and renditions, but there is something very interesting in close emulation too
I had in my mind plenty of ideas
From one of the apartments in which I used to live, I had a view like this from the Alhambra
I might try to do a version myself
There are so many bad people in the world
That some people are blaming the victims in this thread is evidence of how low some people can go
The very ones trying to excuse this have probably done it at various points in their lives
I hope she and her family get the help they need and people develop enough humanity to leave them alone

My great grandfather fought for the nazis willingly in the USSR
Spain was devastated after the civil war, he had experience as a soldier after 3 years of fighting and nazis paid well (about 45
000 spaniards fought for them), so well that in 2015 I read that some veterans were still being paid by Merkel's government, nothing wrong with that, war is war
Although I have to say that spaniards thought they were fighting communism and they fought only against the USSR, never against the allies
And there were reports of fights between spaniards and germans because of the treatment germans gave to war prisoners and jews

Someone even did a Spain Civil War with the Provinces, but we don't talk about it because La Rioja won
Honey this is Spain, everyone wants to be “not Spain “. It’s what brings us together as a country, along with garlic and olive oil
Wait, La Rioja won
How is that even possible
I often forget they even exist
At least we got great wine
we made something similar in southern spain in order to preserve the endangered iberian lynx and avoid them getting ran over
As far as I know this was the attack with most victims on euroean soil
The far right as always are  talking about national terrorism and ignoring islamofascist, and Diaz Ayuso is doing another circus
Poor victims
how is it "so clearly" a muslim group
Spain was being massacred by ETA
If 11M was the first attack of AlQaeda, who would've known
In this specific case, I think it was for retaliation
That was months after Spain joined Irak war aligned with USA and UK
Not really, there's a lot of terror attacks you won't have heard about
Jihadist cell
Alquaeda followers apparently
No veto, so the Spanish government will be able to do whatever it wants with the money
More useless subsidies, benefits and associations for friends of people in the government, to buy their votes and stay in power forever
The Spanish worker and entrepreneur won't see a cent of that money
Only time will tell
But I do think is a good deal for all europeans
It would be absolutely terrible if some of the most populated countries in Europe collapsed, it would bring the whole Union and all its members down
Together we thrive
And to stay together we need all our parts to be strong
So I do think that in 5-10 years from now we will be very happy about the results of this deal
Where are all those dutchs that attacked me again and again for saying this would eventually happen and they kept telling me that they would always block it
To be fair part of the deal is to keep human rights and EU values in check
I don't know how it will be enforced, but I hope it's a step to make those countries to truly follow the European values, rights and liberties
The rule is that we keep having euros as our currency so german exports can be diluted so their currency doesn't get appreciated and they can be even more competitive
Did you really think they wouldn't give us the money when they are the ones that get the most out of it
Look at the countries that get the most out of the eurozone  [ , look where Germany, Ireland and Benelux are
Do you really think they want to go back to a divided europe when they are the ones most benefited
Lol, they will give us money to shut us up
And we will be stupid enough to take the money and keep being poors, diluting your currency instead of fighting for our own currency and monetary policy
This
And it's not like they give well reasoned arguments or even keep a facade of civility, this thread just went full stereotypical populist "they're stealing for us

A Vox alert has been activated and we're all following the protocol
Please unwary european bystander, keep your distance with this comment and avoid any kind of mention of usual trigger points like LGBT rights, dictatorships, quarantines or any Spanish community with a regional language
It seems so
We are going with more of a "marshall plan" approach
It was certainly much more effective
*What a childish fantasy*
> Far left
You and I have a very distinct definition of "far left"
PSOE-Podemos is center left at BEST
I'm not, but you're clearly the kind of idiot who calls Podemos government marxist
Also all of my points apply to a Cs voter
You just have to ask your countrymen that think that yesterday deal was "free money for the south" and they would be better off alone
The truth is we're not the ones benefited and 2008 and 2020 crisis were even worse for us because the euro currency has weakened our economy
By the way, I'm not saying the South has no responsability for our situation, I'm saying the north is not doing us a favor as a lot of northerners tend to think
Podemos' government has nothing marxist to it, you can screech as much as you want
It's a progressive political party respectful of the Constitution and the Monarchy, otherwise they would have never got to where they are and agreed with who they agreed with
And I'm not here to teach you what the governments Cs supports with the extreme right is doing and saying regarding LGBT rights or their own stance on Francoism or different nationalisms that aren't theirs, but I recommend you to get in touch with reality every now and then so you know who you're voting to
Have a great day
Let's put 2008 crisis as an example, when we had 28% unemployment rate, in 2011, with our own currency we could have devaluated our currency so german, british and other european tourists could find our country more attractive/cheaper instead of going to Turkey, Egypt, etc
The same with SEAT, Volkswagen, and other car companies would have mantained or even open more fabrics in Spain since the price of employees would be cheaper
Same happens with literally any company
Instead of that we're stuck in the euro so we can do nothing of that and we have had 10 years of unemployment over 15%, that's something no country can resist
Euro currency helps strong economies while destroys the ones that are struggling and have less infrastructure
No wonder why countries like Poland or Czech Republic are doing so well lately and don't want to hear anything about joining the eurozone
Considering how Spanish politics function as if they were a football match and your clearly biased comment towards the government, I was just letting the European audience know that you would shit on our government for a penny and that your opinion "as a Spanish person" should be taken with a grain of salt
Comparing countries with <10% unemployment and some of them in development recieving a shit ton of money from european funds (eastern europe) with Spain that had 28% unemployment rate and it was close to 0% in the funding balance (0
17% of the GDP last year, and we will be net contributors in a year or two)
Ok, whatever
I cannot prove it because it hasn't happen
But I think it's obvious that if you devalue your currency and your products become cheaper for your neighboors to buy, you'll sell more, so your unemployment rate will go down
But if you have the same currency that your neighboor has, then you're fucked and we will be in a spiral of unemployment and debt that we can never get out
Our debt gets bigger because we have a lot of people unemployed that we cannot let live on the streets so we have to help them and we can't get enough money because there's a point where even if you push your taxes up, you don't get more money from your citizens/companies (Laffer curve),
So with that huge debt and the money that we need to invest in not having people living on the streets we cannot use the money to help companies to grow up and hire more people
So companies won't grow, there won't be more employment rate, internal demand won't grow, with no more internal demand companies don't have a reason to grow and so on
The spiral of missery that will never end for us the southerners
Meanwhile every 6-10 years we will have a big crisis that will lead to a big deal like the one we had yesterday that won't have any benefit long term
It's our fault
Yes, mostly, it's our fault that we started the cycle (1992-2007 bubble) but it's not our fault that we're stuck in it (2012 onwards)
Can we solve it having the euro as our currency
I highly doubt it
What's the solution
There are a few options in my opinion:
\-Keep going on with the same strategy of injecting money until the debt is so big that everything explodes
\-Further integration, but that would mean taxes from richer countries going to pay infrastructure on poorer countries
\-Desintegration, but that would mean a default for southern countries, since if our currencies go down in value it's obvious that we won't be able to pay our debts in euros
\-2 euro currencies, one for the north, one for the south, that can fluctuate in value, so if the south needs to cheapen its prices we can do it
The same as before but if the currencies of the south are united it's more likely that we can mantain an stable value and pay at least part of the debt, so it wouldn't be a 100% default
What’s funny is that even in my Catholic private school in France, it’s was 100% normal to criticize the church and catholics in general
And it’s completely normal to do it in public
Some of it is fair and some of it is unfair
Catholicism is seen as the thing that prevents France from progressing and evolving but somehow Islam is immune from it
There is this ridiculous code of silence in France where Islam isn’t talked about in any “negative” manner
It’s something only racist people do, or a British or American thing
There will be a speech and everyone will forget it happened and when elections come people
will wonder why a far-right party keeps winning seats in the assembly
Cheer up, France
must defeat the evil deeds of the wicked
OP is defending the murder of a Muslim in the hands of skinheads of the French National Front as the result of a "street brawl", and refusing to condemn that murder as right wing terrorism
Right now I'm really disappointed at this sub moderation
Heavenly thinking about reporting it to Reddit administration
Notice that OP was recently banned on r/France
Downplayed the murder of a Muslim man by skinheads as a "brawl", and actually refused to acknowledge the existence of far-right terrorism ever existing in France
I've seen people banned here by much less, IDK what's happening right now
Edit: I forgot, he also engaged any Muslim user that replied to the post condemning the attack, and insulted them and their faith directly and viciously, this comments I think he deleted them himself but should be still reachable in his post history
1995, in the French National Front terrorist attack, also in Paris
Not him, but
The French National Front members plotted the killing of an human being for being muslim
Do with that information whatever your morality allows you to do with it
Just before midday, a small group splintered away from the National Front parade
Media reports would later describe the four men as skinheads
They reportedly came to the Carrousel Bridge in search of homosexuals to harass
Instead, they found Bouarram
Lawyers for 19-year-old Mickael Freminet would argue that Bouarram hurled insults at him
That Bouarram’s death was unintentional
That Freminet was not, in fact, a skinhead
But what was undeniable was that Freminet gave Bouarram a shove, in full view of passersby
Bouarram fell into the water
Freminet and his companions watched as he drowned
Wonderful people those who belong to the French National Front, aren't they
Wonderful people
>I am muslim myself
>I fled from my homecountry precisely because I don't want to live under Sharia and all that bullshit
then why are you a muslim if you don't follow muslim laws
>These radicals and their supporters needs to be kicked out, I don't understand why europeans are such pussies
This could backfire for you, you either kick the muslims or you don't, radicals usually don't support the jihad in public
You are now a guy who said "it was a murder that started with a brawl".
The facts
The French National Front
organization of peace
It's sad my french friend, deep inside is sad
They'll use vodka
F for Poland

YES, france is france
I wake up right now and my eyes are burning with this photo hahahahahaha
Really cool btw
I wish I could understand German to understand most comments here
They have *really* invaded us
It's the bait we use to sunburn Germans
We paint balconies with Union Jack's colors
Blitzkrieg
We should unite and start trhowing away towels we find this way
What's happening
You might not be in Spain but in Mallorca, a well known German land
Toss them in the pool
I'm Spanish
I'd gladly let germans take our country if that means they can fix our gov problems
omg
I guess this picture is taken in Mallorca
We live mostly off of tourismo here, and about 60-70% of the tourists are either German or Brits, and hotels prefer germans since they are not so
How to say this without offending anybody
Not so savage
I mean most brits come here to drink and party while germans also do so but they don't lose control so often
So in Mallorca germans have some privileges
Ooohh oh oh ok
Are those funny memes
I think ours is the commiest non commie flag (red and yellow but not a star, like China, Vietnam, USSR, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia)
Some people here (but most of our redditors) would like to change it for the republican version (replacing the lower red stripe for a purple one) but I think that would just look like a 90º flipped Romanian flag (which itself already looks like Moldova's, Andorra's and Chad's)
No, no, no, see
Only British countries allowed
Other countries run by little girls
Britain stronk and very very special
People surprised that brexit actually had consequences
Maybe next time they should think before casting a ballot
Only a brit deals in absolutes
In the North it was perceived more as "They want to steal our money
If they had been hardworking like all of us they wouldn't be suffering now
Yeah, I was gonna say
I got into San Marino from Rimini without trouble a few months ago, so I figured it was always in the Schengen Zone
Nice little fact

Edit: I have updated the post with all the info
Yes, I've started to feel it too
After 2016 and seeing someone like Donald Trump get elected, after seeing Brexit being voted for, after seeing Vox get so many votes in Andalucia, this copyright bullshit happening, the rise of far-right public elected officials, the worrying increase in natural disasters due to climate change, the fact that we have no privacy in the internet, that democracy is worthless because money is more important than what the people think
Shit's depressing yo
Search for what eurodiputees your country has and Ctrl+f their names on the pdf by Julia
So it seems like EFDD, ECR and EFA have the highest concentration of against votes
EDIT: NGL too, didn't see them
I think you're being very generous with your 95%.
I can't think of anyone that would actually consider EU politics and vote for a party other than the party they'd vote for in national elections
It will be interesting in Spain since there will be a high turnout since the EP elections coincide with municipal elections
There's plenty of false positives already
This will only create more issues to creators

The city that started WW2 and the city that started the fall of communism
Or literally all Russian Civil war
The ex-russian empire republics fighting civil wars too between socialists and capitalists, the latter with western aid/intervention
WW1 didn't end, Germany kept fighting on eastern europe
The point was fighting back against other empires
It literally was expected to be a regular war, but technology had advanced to a point any war would be a bloodbath
In terms of wars on the world in total number, probably more afterwards, since empires didn't fight that many wars
Scandinavians sure know how to party
Spain's most expensive drug: Jamon de Jabugo

I see jamón, I upvote

All my support for the protests and for my Serbian brothers and sisters, you guys deserve much better
Hope the protests help your cause
BUT, can we all take a minute to appreciate the difference in the tone of this thread and of those of BLM protests regarding the coronavirus and the social distancing and all that
Can we just appreciate the general hypocrisy of this sub
Can we all admit that the problem for most here *wasn't* the pandemic
I'm reading this now drunk af and I don't event get what are you trying to say

That’s cool
It is likely to go to isolationism in England, not Great Britain
Except Scotland can't be independent without London's approval, and that's not coming
Cool, you had to comment
It's not about breaking up the UK
It's about wanting to keep together with our Scottish and Irish brothers, as they want to keep together with us
What could go wrong with UK leaving an organization it has 50% of its trade with

Spain will lead Europe to the victory
Tbh in Spain we've been fucked non-stop since March
We didn't see such a new increase because we were already up there lol
Gosh it really is going downhill

For some countries coffee is a beverage that is meant to be enjoyed and it's quality is judge by its taste
For other countries coffee is just a drug, and it's quality is judge by its potency
My same reaction
For all the fuss about how Finns love their coffee, the ones I have tasted are absolutely terrible
>So, strong coffee that's light roast = battery acid
Finally someone gives me an explanation
That is exactly what I got
I like black coffee without sugar so you can understand my surprise when I went to Finland and they offered me
that
I think it is an acquired "taste", however
It still tastes terrible, but there is a part of me that actually enjoys the utter bitterness of it
In Germany I have seen both in equal parts
In Finland, mostly milk in my experience

Oh, the Middle East must be a fat area

Siesta is great on weekends, though
Also, I think it's a good thing, not something it makes you get fatter

I was like "Nice, about time we get El Bierzo back". Then I look at the legend and saw that we are in the Mediterranean or worse Catalans (because we like being liked)
Like wtf
I'm not offended, just confused
Wtf is that spanish map
Also where is portugal lmao
Is catalonia on the wrong place on purpose
I’m offended you forgot Paid Vasco
Lol you got spain all wrong
Galicia is where you placed Catalunya, where Galicia is mentioned in south east spain is the most far right reactionary part of the country
And basques will pretty pissed off you omitted them
Sooo good job I guess
Same thing with Catalonia

No one talks about it because there are many people burning and vandalising things

Petit con
The problem is that when you make such a shitty article so full of lies and misinformation, you hurt your own objectives
I have a video in Youtube with a soundtrack for which I have a licence
I received a copyright claim and they allowed me to keep the video but the revenue goes to them (TBH, I think it doesn't have any revenue)
I appealed and basically Youtube came back almost instantly rejecting the appeal telling me that I could appeal again if I disagreed, but that if I continued appealing copyright claims and they kept rejecting them they would consider it an abuse and they would lock my Google account
including my Gmail account
Congrats from Spain i’m 21% greek and hope to see to see the country soon
That looks like a very soft brexit
I think there should be a bigger margin to actualy do any change
Making a change as drastic as Brexit based on just a 2% seems too weak of a difference to do any significant change, based on the feelings people had in a particular moment in time
Probably, needing at least a 60% of the votes to move forward with that significant change would be better, since more people seem quite convinced about it
Also, what the reporter is saying, I think it makes sense if after getting to leave, they dont have the chance in the future to vote to join back
Then it would be a "lets vote until I get my result and then we never ask again"
Yep, we give them money, but we also recognized the independence of a part of his country (not my country in particular, but most of the EU) I wonder why they don’t love us

You don't fool us Elon, this is retaliation for the Top Gear review
The UK has suffered a huge loss from the Brexit decision
also the fact that you have massive amounts of oil that no other country in western Europe has
OK, I'm sorry for this community
The right wing majority are fiercely invested in the cold war propaganda of Russia=soviet union=bad
So they hate Russia even after the 1990s liberalization disaster, essentially allowing anti-west politicians like putin to rise
And the eastern Europeans found that the best way to keep a strong nationalism blind enough to hide local problems and unite the population is to point at external enemies and demonize them
So they hate you too
So those 2 large groups in this sub hate everything Russian except what attempts to break Russia from the inside (navalny gets their support while being a useful controversial asset)
"You see, Belgrade and it's civilians were asking for it"

I have never, ever, visited a city with a huge pedestrian/car restricted zone and think "wow, I wish this was not here". On the contrary, I always find that it gives the cities so much more live and beauty for its inhabitants
It takes political will and some years to get used to it, to change behaviors, routines, etc, but there is no go back, in the same way that there is no go back to smoking in a hospital or a plane

Whatever the consequences, hopefully we can continue to cooperate peacefully
Despite everything, Brexit still makes me sad
I don't fear for the future of the EU and I am somewhat confident that it may actually be a good thing in the long run for those of us who would like to see further integration in some areas
However, at the same time, it feels like a defeat of harmony
I liked this moment of the session, just after the voting:

However, there are two things that strike me:
\- 101 biology (I read in other comment that you something like that in your university, but it is surprising because I haven't seen that anywhere in Europe, in my experience)
\- 4:20
Don't people in Greece use the 24 h clock for their devices
At least in Spain, almost all digital clocks would say 16:20 by default
420 nice

I knew about Reunion and other EU territories "abroad" but there's something about having free roaming in the middle of the Indian Ocean that feels so crazy to me
The EU is a great thing
Spaniards can't even go to a different province
Reactionary anti tankies that complain even when we celebrate that the red army killed nazis
And it doesn't take 2 braincells to understand what an overreaction is
Ever been stung by a mosquito to see your arm inflate
That's people complaining that soviets took out nazi control over some area
They're not the same thing, there's different reasons why they were bad
And reactionary makes sense as an adjective
Is a comparison with Newton laws
One of which is about each force on an object creating a equal one with opposite direction
Years of soviet rule radicalized some people on the opposite way, blinding their perception and destroying their objectivity
If so, this is a terrible plan
It is much more likely that power would end up in Labour's hands, with a very hard left current leadership
Oh I agree, I think Corbyn likes brexit, without the EU he could implement his hard left agenda more easily
In fact that is why I think if such a plan exists, it is absolutely full of hubris
If the goal of a no-deal chaotic brexit is achieved, the most likely outcome is a much less market friendly Britain orchestrated by Corbyn

That's not as much as I thought
France is slight BS
Most french (at least outside Paris) stay home with their parents way later than 23
I think a lot has to to do with uni and jobs
The best unis are pretty concentrated in Paris and a lot of students have to move to attend
Also, the vast majority of professional jobs are in Paris
Even in cities like Lyon or Marseille really don’t have professional jobs for recent grads, so moving to Paris is inevitable for some
edit: I know my flair says Spain, but my mother is French and I went to school in France, I’m French
That’s why I said SLIGHT BS
I swear to God most of the times I have to double check the flair to see if a comment refers to either Italy or Spain because everything is so similar lol
That's pretty rare in the US, too
Most kids leave to go to school or go get a job
Honestly, more people would in Europe if they could

I have no idea, I've only been here this year
It's so worth the chill
The arches at the top yeah, look for videos in youtube about arches being build so you understand
It is taken care of but there aren't many earthquakes in the area
What did actually deteriorate it was the traffic of cars next to it and the vibrations of concerts
There are no earthquakes in this area of Spain and it's not terribly windy
Maybe the picture misrepresents the huge size of those blocks
You should visit if you get the chance
there are many restaurants like that one in Segovia and they all make the best pork you'll ever eat
So tender you can cut it with a plate
edit: damn now I want some
Ah haha yeah I didn't understand your question, the top part is obviously with some kind of mortar because the water flows through there so if it were just rocks the water would fall through the holes
yeah
Also some judiones before the pig to make sure you won't get up from the seat until 6pm like a good Spaniard
The gaps between the rocks are very big because they are not perfect, plus the rivers have mud and sand covering the gaps
You can make a religion out of this
Do we keep Majorca then
It's over France we have the high ground now
All Spaniards emigrate to a place with a better economy, all British can retire in the sunny south (and walk to Gibraltar) and all Germans can have their Lebensraum at last
Everyone's happy, aren't they
Edit: also, I'm loving the game Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino are playing
France and Spain don't have a better relationship
And Belgian
You're allowed in, though
It seems there's a quota then

Why
I mean, we are not Americans, is not like he would have troubles paying the hospital bill (there are no hospital bill after all)
Extremadura sweetie we love you no matter what
Calais and Picardy are in transition from shit to kind of shit
Living in the less developed region of Spain all I can say is that I would like to see some industry being made here, ecologists have blocked many saying that they are harmful and will destroy the ecosystem but I think that we should have an ecolibrium between industry and nature, except a few cities extremadura is just countryside

A jamón based economy is delicious though not very productive
There are few outside Europe
The origin of Europe is Italy
Roman towns does not mean Roman founded towns
Some of them probably existed already
It wasn't founded by Rome
But I am surprised that Rome didn't found any city in Anatolia
I don't trust this map
Isn't it supposed to be this one in the map
:  (OP probably eyeballed it)
In any case, either that, or they didn't include it because it was founded by the Roman Republic not the Roman Empire
It's like Spain, a civilized country

What's sadder is that the number of new corona confirmations is increasing again
Yesterday, new confirmed to be 580
It's a really evil virus
Here in Madrid they put a monument for the deceased over a month ago
It seems they are totally trying to give the message that the worst part is finished (IMHO, because summer and tourism), but the numbers of new cases are just increasing
This is going to be a funny summer
29k is the official number, but compared to last year, there have been 40k more deaths, so it's very likely that the real number is closer to that
Can you point out when they have supported fascism or you simply call fascist to anyone you don't like
Cringe
>Racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism
You can't prove any of that
You have been told that and you are repeating it
They are fascists, they must be those things too
Ok, so you have nothing to answer
A true fascist would never deny being fascist
Pro tip: next time anyone is in Alicante go to [Cervecería Sento] and order the Ivan and some piruletas and chupachups

This is like the seaside walkway, not a huge investment considering its a single line along the main beach
Its also colour altered a bit, the blue is not so strong otherwise in stones like these
Spaniards: oh yeah, I hate Spaniards as well
But I hate foreign invaders more
No worries I found it funny
Bien, pero me estás hablando en español por lo tanto gano yo
I meant in a historical way
Although Romans got us
Took them a while tho, and they didn't really get Basques, nobody did
Cádiz, the canary Islands, and all the colonies remained independent afaik
How about reducing taxes so tax heavens are not necessary
*EU* Army
the comments are full of mental gymnastics jesus christ
Never forget that European lands are still occupied by Turkey and that Europeans died protecting those lands
And don't bother saying that Cyprus isn't geographically European
What are you talking about
Turkey invaded Cyprus 50 years ago
It is culturally
It is in the European Union, after all
And in the US people forgot about masks and distances the moment Floyd was killed because somehow the virus doesn't affect you if you are fighting racism
Europe should prevent a recurrence and prepare thoroughly so that it does not become like the United States
Until the vaccine comes out
Europe is right and America is wrong
Oh, is that a satirical media
We have a very good one in Spain called El Mundo Today
Here when we see ridiculous news in a serious media, we say it looks it was taken from El Mundo Today
This happens more frequently than it should :(
>and they have even two MEPs in the European Parliament (don’t ask why)
I dare to ask why
Can't see the eiffel tower, Holywood tought us that from every window in paris, you can see the eiffel tower, so this must be fake
Here in Spain our current president (Pedro Sánchez, left, socialist party) tried to pull the same stunt two elections ago, if I remember correctly he wanted only one debate on public TV and actually canceled his presence in the private TV
Obviously he got called out from all parties on each side and went to the debate in the end
Three elections ago the then president (Mariano Rajoy, right, Popular Party) accepted debating only with Pedro Sánchez on public TV and refused the one with the rest of the parties on private TV
The difference being Mr Rajoy has literally no shame and couldn't be forced to go, he had the nerve to send his second instead
One day we got 12 new residents from Georgia at our student residence in Germany
It was
interesting
We never had special forces storm our house before
are you ok
i hope everyone is ok
With no offense to our Armenian friends, but when I see kids with flags I see the same when I see kids with religious beads and it doesn't make sense to me
Kids need to learn we live in a planet first before learning how we politically organize it
Spain and Portugal just chilling as usual
We always were and always will be
nobody complained about the rising of sea levels
I don't see any difference
Sorry bro, just let go
*winks at sweeden*
I love to drink Maltas
Does that count
I guess you arent up for another dance
Was expecting a Spanish Inquisition meme
Not even disappointed
There is a spanish dude next to the border sign and he moves it 1cm every night while you guys are not looking
1 VS 1 Dance fight the winner gets to annex olivença lets settle this
Yes
Not fair either, most of people already think Jamon Iberico is spanish
How about a team dancematch and we bet some random island
Hmmmmm
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
We really did put the turbo in Spain regarding LGBT rights, I don't think there are many other countries in the world that had such an amount of legal and social change in such short time
We were the third country in the world to legalize gay marriage and homosexuality was still illegal down here not even 30 years before that
This isn't legalization of homosexual relationships, this is legalization of homosexuality in general
Basically, whether they'll put you in jail (or worse) just for being gay or not
I was thinking of Ireland too when I wrote my comment yeah, there's definitely some resemblance
Yet considering that we were coming out of a 40 year long fascist dictatorship I think we stepped on the gas harder (not that is a competition of course)
FORZA ITALIA
100% latin culture polician
(Who am I to talk, right
Lying politicians
She looks as miserable as always
And the matching hats
She's been running the country successfully for 12 (?) years now and Germany is now one of the wealthiest
She shouldn't be miserable
It would be a pinnacle of European History
Holy fuck lol
We're trying to get into nordic
We are hot-blooded Mediterraneans
I think you misunderstood what we mean with "get into nordic"...
But we already have half of the Nordic population living here
How dare you, Eesti is a lady
And hot, too, no one would refuse
Oh man I drove that downhill at night with cars coming the other way
not really recommended
The walls are very European
Spain is a truly dynamic country
What's up with the misleading titles in all this posts mate
It usually snows every year in Madrid, but it doesn't really settle down and just turn into ice
The special thing about this event is the ridiculous amount of snow
Today snowed in Madrid for the first time in 70 months you mean
We have snow once every two years or so but it does not stick to the ground
The last time the airport was closed due to the snow was in 2009
I wouldn't say 70 year but it is the biggest in snow modern Madrid's  recorded history
Snows sometimes , but rarely takes hold and remain on ground, except on the nearby sierra
Also, people have ski equipment because there is a ski station an hour away from Madrid city
I was in Warszawa when it happened
I remember I was amazed to see snowflakes as big as oranges that settled super fast, it didn't last long tho :(
Well you are lucky cause in de city of Madrid it hasnt snowed like this probably since 1904
fun fact, I grew up near Madrid, in the mountains, and I remember there were some "special holiday" every year, variable in dates and duration
due to the snow
It used to plow about 10cm once a year
Years like this, were a real nightmare, I remember my father defreezing the garden's door with the blowtorch, completely locked with ice
And somehow we will have -13 degrees after the snow storm
Does it ever snow, snow in Madrid
It can be at the Pirinees, even at Sierra Nevada
There, it can even snow, snow
snow
but in Madrid
It snows on average 3 days per year in Madrid
It isn't that the title isn't clear, it's plain wrong
Duh, they pretending to be germans here
It's just that normally when moisture comes, it's with warmer air
The cold is typically very dry
The temperatures are pretty normal for winter
As a former young person, I still have memories of waiting for that yearly snowfall we'd get in the late 60s early 70s. Not every year, but it wasn't unusual to see snow on the ground for a day or so
I also recall my dad telling me that it was nothing compared to his youth
which brings me back to your point:
[A nostalgic voyage to Madrid’s winter wonderland]
The mountains in Madrid have two ski stations that have reliable snow every winter
Snow in the city that sticks is rare, especially like this, but it at least snows a bit each year, generally
I've been big into a lot of pre WWII and WWII history lately and I think the fact that Croatian Free State has never really been reckoned with was a major part of the Yugoslav wars
I can kind of get Serbians being very threatened by the checkerboard crest
Not that any of the reaction were in anyway acceptable either
Tudman needed the nationalism for Independence so really went out of his way to ignore the past
>  unfetter capitalism can work to some degree
If you need to qualify it "to some degree" that is not unfettered
We had a taste of that during the Industrial Revolution which ended up with children working in factories
Laws limited that
We can all see how well capitalism works in regards to health care in the US
No, thanks
Companies such as Glove have lowered the pay of their "associates" (I don't know which bullshit term they use instead of workers in English) even though they are working now more than ever
Including unwittingly taking drugs from one home to another
AirBnB has destroyed neighbourhoods and has raised rent prices so that workers can no longer live where they used to
All to host drunk idiots who don't allow any rest to the neighbours who live and work there
No, thanks
Keep your unfettered capitalism
wtf
Are your corneas OK
Reminds me of the galician stereotype
Actually, that's not capitalism, it's crony capitalism
There's no free market if few companies dominate the market with government compliance and intervention

I have seen more people than ever defend the public healthcare system and agreeing with seizing the private infrastructure for the common good, so something good might come out of this misery

Latinos are just people whose mother language is a romance one (Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese
That's in America, in the rest of the world is what I said
"El término latino (adjetivo; del latín latinus, "aquél o aquello que es natural del pueblo que hablaba latín") tiene diversas acepciones y suele prestarse a confusión."
Use Google translate
ctrl+f latino
You'll find the word everywhere, also in French, Italian, Portuguese wikipedia articles about latin
latino = related to latin (Roman Empire language)
America latina is just the part of America where "latin" (romance languages) is spoken
You could call latinos to the Canadians who speak in French are you won't be wrong
> in their own language is a different case, but you reffered to them as latin
It's the same in english
>Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the western Hemisphere where Romance languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French are predominantly spoken
"Latino" is not a race or a culture it just adjetive that tells what language you do speak as mother language
Idk what to say, I've seen a lot of articles talking about Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Paz Vega
and saying they are latinos and they have nothing to do with Latin America (Spain is in Europe, it borders with France and Portugal) So, is Luc Benson latino too
he is from France after all, or how this works, because is not clear at all (at least in America)
Example:
> personally
That's the problem, I don't know your own and personal definition of the world
The uprising happened too early
Heavy nazi reinforcements came by the time soviets were near the river, stopping soviet advances and crushing the uprising
Read up the dates on which stuff happened, soviets weren't keen on their enemy encroaching on a large city just to annoy poles
The Warsaw gueto was much braver, which is why it's better known
1943, soviets aren't anywhere near and done guys fight to death because the alternative is being exterminated
1944, soviets on your doorstep before being kicked out by germans, so they rebel to gain independence
Soviet spearhead had to retreat from near Warsaw due to an armored counterattack
Citations needed
Literally quoting fascist propaganda to own the soviets, wtf
I read the whole article before you posted parts of it
Military plans had other intentions, not taking Warsaw, so when the army approaching Warsaw was pushed back there weren't reserves to conduct another offensive to enter and clear Warsaw
Nothing crazy about it
Military archives seem to give enough information of location of soviet units to see this
I support holding another referendum in Scotland after Brexit, but keep in mind that if you become independent, it must be legally or Spain will never recognise it and you will never join the EU
Well, not the current Spanish government, future governments may accept them even if they declare their independence out of the British law if the British, for any reason, don't let them hold a referendum
That won't happen, most parties agree on that
Too many things must change for that to happen
That's why Spain has never recognised Kosovo, and it never will
No, most Spanish parties share that position
It doesn't seem like it right now, but it's not impossible
There are political parties with millions of votes that would support that as they support the right to hold a referendum also in Catalunya
They will need to grow much more in order to form a government without any of the other parties, but who knows what the future holds
Things change, hell things have changed a lot in the last 5 years, who knows if they can change more in the future
I cannot predict the future (neither can you) but it's certain that the possibility exists
As there are millions of voters in Spain that think like that, in the future we may be some millions more, or not
But that movement exist and it's pretty big to just ignore or say that it will be "impossible".
America was completely knocked down
The death increase is stronger in Brazil
It's the US, they attempt to be number 1 at everything
Good to know
I think here the confirmed cases hitted the plateau around a week or two earlier than the deceases plateau so probably you still need more testing capacity or just have a huge backlog, but moving in the right direction
I'd watch an exhibition about China's interference in other countries, such as in this
Lol the photoshopped stars are getting out of hand, no way they're ever that visible here
The "cabin" itself is near the slopes of a skiing center, and it's just a movie prop with four walls and nothing on the inside
There are however many similar actual cabins here

oh god, I’ll have to remember to carry money around again
German cars go brrrrrrrr
TIL some places have different speed limits for the same roads depending on the time of the day
Sounds crazy to me
Is it for encouraging people to avoid travelling during rush hours
Speed limit should be 150, with modern cars you barely notice it
That was 9 years ago and only lasted for like 4 months lol
Nah, I don't think so
I've been to Sweden several times and I don't recall such thing either, although granted that I did't take motorways that often

I got my popcorn fried in extra virgin olive oil ready
Made a subreddit for these: r/CataloniaMemes ,check it out if you want
Don't you ever do that
It tastes terrible
TERRIBLE I TELL YOU
It's not fun without the monkeys
You are really fucked at general knowledge man
What
I think you are doing it wrong
Just put the corn with some oil in a pan and cover it
bang bang
fium fium
aghhrrr
Well, you have to recognize that for all the rest of us know about Hungarian, it _could_ be
It tastes too bitter for me
Maybe my corn-per-oil ratio was wrong
Just put enough oil to cover the base of the pan but not too much so that the corn is submerged
Köszönjük, hogy tanított minket
Yeah, you can do it if you're careful so long as it's not virgin/extra virgin olive oil
But really, sunflower seed oil is better
Will do
Thanks
Well, dude didn't say "in Hungarian it's spelled Szizlák", rather "it could pass for one of our words". Trump could not have come from a misspelling of Trumpo, because Trumpo _could pass for_ a Spanish name, but isn't.
Hey, I also reversed the translation to make sure it worked
This Sunday's the vote, so whatever unfolds will happen next week
Until October 1st, that day nothings happens, and separatists eats their words and life goes on
It is
Pitchforks are ready in Madrid
Yep, worked excellently for the non-French languages
> To prove that we can do things better if we want
I mean, I want to do things better
Hell, the whole continent is joining mainly to do things better than in the past
What does that have to do with being one country or two different countries
Maybe is because we don't really want them in Spain anymore, they just try to steal from other regions and don't contribute
That's fucked up
Yeah I agree with that
But /u/Erratic85's point is the opposite, that independence would enable it
Why would we Canarians be bundled with any of you Godos
You guys all look similar to us :P
The Ruta de la Plata line between Plasencia and Salamanca does not exist anymore, it was closed in 1985
Valladolid-Ariza doesn't exist either
Now if we could just dont use this stupid years after christ stuff
Makes sense if you remember the Black Sea basin was a neolithic hub and a potential urheimat of the Indo-European culture (and probably the origin of the deluge stories in the Middle East after the quick rise of the level in that sea and the migrations of the peoples inhabiting it's coasts)
Plovdiv, Bulgaria
More than 8k years
Something similar happened here in Spain, almost 800 million euros of aid for the unemployed were stolen by members of the socialist party in Andalusia
It is the largest corruption case in Spain
Los ERE de Andalucía?
The PP has stolen more in different corruption cases when added up, but yeah
PPSOE, two parties, same actions

As a Spaniard I wonder what it is to live in a house where you don't hear your neighbors go to the bathroom
I suppose the good point is that I'm 15 minutes walking to my workplace
I'm from Spain and I totally agree with this
Madrid and Barcelona are full of flats
Oh no
anyways, this does not surprise me
Cities and neighborhoods in Spain were planned from a underdeveloped and rural evironment, villages were abandoned and cities grew fast
Also, suburbs are almost non-existent
The big towns near big cities evolved in cheaper neighborhoods for this cities (called bedroom neighborhoods, for a reason), they removed the old fashioned housing and built flat blocks on the towns
I don't know if this was like that in other countries, but mainly all cities are based in flats and most of the people lives in the cities
You gotta fix all your stuff by yourself
It sucks ass
Of course, I also live in the E.E.U.U. for now but when I lived in Deutschland, housing wasn’t too different from a flat since you’ve got a yard and a dedicated garage if it’s pricey enough, but otherwise it’s just a glorified flat
Living in a flat is certainly easier and cheaper than living in a home where you can spend upwards of 1% of your purchase price in maintaining the property per year alone
Sounds great until you're waken up at 6am by your neighbour's dog/heels/TV/blender/music/speaking/door
I miss houses :(
I love being able to walk everywhere
I've lived in a house and you needed a car for the littlest thing
Very annoying
But
neighbours
noises
Or at least is what I hope
I'm so sick of my neighbours
Not that I have the money to move out but it fills my dreams
They’re still there and they get into arguments over your dog or that you’re mowing (or not mowing) their lawn
And if you have windows facing them, you gotta keep them covered so they don’t look into your home like creeps
Jajajajaja
Houses are useful for kids, not for a couple or maybe someone with a baby
As you get older, a home becomes more important — especially in the US

Invest in jails
article 155 and some people in jail
Just like that we have arrived at the greatest attack to spanish democracy since 23-F. It is all kinds of abhorrent that a group that represents 48% of the Catalan people has sentenced both Catalonia and the rest of Spain to a period of social and economical turmoil
This farce created to hide the financial incompetence of the Catalan nationalist parties has reached critical mass and stomped the dignity of all of us Spaniards
What has happened today in Catalonia proves that the true fascists were the ones that shielded themselves with their citizens while nonchalantly breaking not only the Spanish Law but also their own laws
Referendums with rules changed 45 minutes before and without any control, laws approved at 2AM with no opposition to fight them and a parliament closed to all needs of the catalan people except for the one that has been rammed inside the heads of everyone
Independence
What now has to be done is what any other democracy in the world would do, make sure that the rule of law still protects the rights of all citizens regardless of their ideology and care for the safety of the people of Catalonia both unionists and independentists (the current government of Catalonia cared for the safety of neither)
Let's all hope this political tragicomedy does not become a full catalan tragedy
Say good bye to the business and factories of Catalonia
The death of catalan nationalism
What the fuck mate
Just
What the fuck
What do they think it's going to happen now
I'm stuck between bursting out laughing and feeling incredibly offended by their stupidity
At least in a few years I can say I witnessed this
Spanish government: *quicksaving*
> Have the Catalonian secessionists explained how they plan to remain in EU but at the same time be independent
Their point of view was that Europe would be delighted to have them since they are the only worthwhile region of Spain anyway
OMFG THE IBEX IS DROPING LIKE CRAZY, PERFECT IDIOTS
No, because the results of that referendum were the same of a previous one that was declared ilegal but not prohibited
Non independentists refused to take part of the votation
This
The catalan govt never had the authority to declare this anyway
Not OP but yes, it's happened
People around me are disgusted with the coup
Nah, just the police, and they will do their job
Checkmate separatists
That seems to be a running theme with these guys
If they thought that we were stealing their moneys, this is gonna be a whole new level of stealing that the best pirates are gonna be jealous
IIRC, there were 10 abstentions, 2 no votes (in order to give legal cover when Spanish prosecution happens) and the rest had abandoned the parlament
*remembers the procedure of everytime Catalonia tried
Fuck we are in the 21st century
Can't do that
I remember the former President of the Catalan Government saying companies would be fighting each other to be in Catalonia
How many companies have already left
I think it was around 700
Its what a superiority complex does to reality perception
Its not impossible, but you need a majority of Spain's political forces to agree and reform the Constitution to allow it
Hard to achieve
Yes, but not impossible
Thats a point of view I cant share
Catalonya's rulers tried to blackmail the central government for more privileges in a critical economical period, the government said no and the own internal political crisis of traditional catalan rulers made them push for independence as a scapegoat
PP is to blame for being a bunch of corrupts and incompetents, but this mess
This was all on Catalonya
Not true
Exactly
Even if you don't feel Spanish, which you have every right to do, you must see that a DUI is nuts

What highways
Last time I've been in Romania that was anecdotal, 90% of roads were only one lane in each direction
And more frightening than Italy, which I thought it was impossible
We are fucked then, China is allowed to lay road and railroads from beijing to cadiz
Spain, the Land of Art
I hope this spread across Europe
Now the question is if this loot boxes make more than 1
5M per month in the Netherlands
They would take a 0
5M loss but if they withdraw it could give other countries the idea that this works and loose a bigger market
The Netherlands is more densely populated than India, but it seems much  quieter than India
I have to say that as spanish speaker, that applies to us

i really love these types of floats
we have a similar tradition called "fallas" in valencia
Trump is not the only one buttfucking Americans
They are not even the same
You kinda were looking for it
I like the fallas, but going around to unrelated topics to diminish other traditions is calling for attention
I think it would be good to have an international agreement so that everyone had to pay if they polluted too much
There should be a limit of tons of CO2 per country depending on population, gdp, level of development
And then if a country crosses the line they would have to pay to others that are far from the line for their "unused" tons of CO2, this would benefit advanced countries that are comited to the planet as well as poor ones in Africa who can't even pollute because of underdervelopment
"Possibility to set Legaly binding goals" means they fucking made a RECOMMENDATION already, meaning it's not mandatory and there won't be really a punishment if you don't meet the criteria, but they will make all the technical documents for free and open for EU monetary help implementing the measures
Just 30 minutes in the life of any middleschooler, explaining how the EU works would have saved UK from brexit
yurop stronk
someone make me a punk-rock song
i ain't gonna be no league of nations, naa, naa, na na-na naaa
I just checked the Eurostat and Spain for example has gone from 9
78 to 7
54 since the year 2000
Comparing only reduction is kinda misleading because ofc Germany is reducing because it was so high to begin with, and right now they are still at 11
41 tons per capita and the UK at 8
Like any other piece of binding legislation in the EU
The EU has approved it, just like the title states
Each country place their own limit and only it can enforce it, as the agreement has absolutely no way to do it
Why is it so misleading
I could not find anything in the article
That was clutch
As long as it is just one relevant country, the rest can just tax it
The problem is if a few major countries don't agree
Some countries don't have a choice, they either pollute or die
It's like a cheat code in Civilization 5
Sick
Why can't London do that when everyone in New York has to work from home
I have the theory that your gov is trying to turn the island into a battle royale
Australia, we allowed you into Eurovision, but c'mon, this is going a bit too far
I was 11 at the time and really didn’t understand until a few years later what happened, or didn’t understand just how crazy and unusual it was

This is just PR
Romania will continue to have a lackluster economy as long as it’s professionals keep emigrating and corruption continues
I hate these post, it implies the EU is actually doing something (or even can do anything) to create a structurally sound Romania
Very awesome
And it's now Poland the one that shouldn't exist anymore
Sorry for Poland A.
"Ups, my camera shot this by accident
good
Im proud of muy country :) Viva España!
To be fair I love this community so much that would be horrible to leave it
Some day I just wonder how lucky I am to have been born and raised as a member of the EU and not in the
Well I don't know, the USA
AFAIK: The only people wanting to leave are nationalists who got mad the EU didnt jail the escaped catalan independentists
100% stay
Because we could use our own currency, make our products cheaper (devaluating our currency against the euro), selling more, that would lead to hiring more people in order to be able to produce everything needed, therefore we wouldn't have 25% unemployment rate
Just to name one
European Union is not a problem, the euro currency without further integration is
And the billionaire deal that they have signed is a simple patch, we'll be in the same spot in a few years
This won't be solved unless we create at least 2 currencies, one for the south, one for the north, or we get political and fiscal union, or we just get out of the euro
There is a small percentage of the population who thinks that if we had our own coin we wouldnt have suffered that much on the 2008 crisis
since we could have devaluated our coin to stay competitive or something like that
but thank god that the people who thinks like that (those morons) are a small percentage of the population
Knowing how stupid our politicians are now, they would hit the "print button" on the money printer to increase the public expenses until we become Argentina or even worse in terms of inflation
Communists ruling would just start printing  "Pesetas" and bankrupt the economy
That is what they stated a lot of times
I would be shocked if there were many of us at all
I mean we dumb, but we not brexit dumb
Euroskeptics here are the far-left, now in power through a coalition, who among other things want a fully independent Spanish central bank to print as much money as they want
They see the EU as an capitalist, pro-austerity, anti-debt (lmfao) regime that wants to impose some kind of late stage capitalism on Spain
Spalida ain't happening neither
Espxit
This
(Sorry, the video is in Spanish)
Spain has had problems with the austerity policies but we identify as europeans and want to be with our fellow europeans
It's not only economic
It's actually way more than that
>they get billions of euros from us
ahhh the irony
Don't give us ideas
Paella chart
Is it though
2018 figures for Spain:
* Total EU spend in Spain – € 12
270 billion(equivalent to 1
02 % of the Spanish economy)
* Total contribution to EU budget – € 10
314 billion(equivalent to 0
85 % of the Spanish economy)
We paid 0
85% of our GDP and recieved 1
02% of our GDP, so we are left with 0
17% of our GDP, that is thanks to the EU, 1 out of every 588
2€ spent in Spain is coming from the EU, do you think that's a big deal for Spain
Is that a "massive amount of money"?
Really Spain pays almost as much as is given by the EU
I'll most likely stay and I think it will surpass the US eventually
To be fair, I'm pretty sure even Zimbabwe is going to surpass the US if they keep doing things like they are doing rn
Yes, but the things we import are not more important than having food, a roof, and a job to go to
Having Iphones, electronic and Audis are not more important than having 25% unemployment rate
It's sad to have to choose, but it's sadder to collapse and be forced to choose under even worse conditions
I don't know what's sadder, that the EU keeping us in line will make us miserable (permanent high debt, high unemployment) or that you're right and our politicians would probably not do the right thing if we gave them the chance and we would end up in a worse situation
It's impossible to know how it would all end up
Plus another problem would be that this needs a long term plan, maybe 10 years, and the first years would be very hard, so people would probably vote the party that promises to "solve it all with another plan that magically makes us all happy", breaking the original plan in pieces, and ending up in a worse situation
So I guess the best way to get through this is just to pray and believe that the European Union will do the best for us
At this point how do we say that to our northern "brothers"? Further integration today means they'd have to pay taxes that would partially go to the south
In Spain (and I'm sure it happens everywhere) Madrid, Catalonia and Balearic Islands (richer regions) pay taxes that go to Andalusia and Extremadura (poorer regions), but we're "used" to it, we were born within this system
But Europe is not a country, how do we start doing the same every country is doing without any of the parts feeling betrayed
I love when ppl use the "yeet" word ahahahHAHAH
I am quite sure we have started civil wars on lesser provocations
Bueno, es un vídeo con tono de humor
Está claro que hay veces que son útiles, pero es cierto que muchas veces se abusa de ellas
In other words, you want to become another Argentina
>In Spain (and I'm sure it happens everywhere) Madrid, Catalonia and Balearic Islands (richer regions) pay taxes that go to Andalusia and Extremadura (poorer regions), but we're "used" to it, we were born within this system
But Europe is not a country, how do we start doing the same every country is doing without any of the parts feeling betrayed
You can't. You need a feeling of in-group solidarity, so that people from the north feel like we, in the south, are part of the same team
I am not bashing the north at all, but that feeling just isn't there
Hell, a big part of the population within Catalonia doesn't have that feeling towards Andalusia, Extremadura, etc
To them, our taxes going to Andalusia means our taxes going "to someone else who is not us".
It just isn't possible for many of the "richer" countries in the north to support the south again and again happily
And make no mistake: there is always wealth inequality between regions, so this wouldn't be "temporary". The feeling of belonging to the same group has to endure for as long as the fiscal union lasts
I find that very hard to happen in Europe
Each one has its uses
Here we have parts of a whole, this is, the total is always the same and one incresing means other decreasing, so best charts are stacked bars or pie
The chart used in OP can be confusing because one could think that No can increase without Yes decreasing, because that's how bar charts are usually used
Not necessarily outside the European Union but outside the euro zone
Look at Poland or Czech Republic, you're doing just fine because you didn't fall in the trap
No, Spain is not near the situation of Argentina, we'd become another Argentina if we wait to do this 10-15 years
If you want your life to be miserable, then become political active in Spain xD
I mean, most people here vote their party as if it was a football team, always and forever loyal to the same club and in most cases inherited from your parents
Have you heard of the Two Spains, in endless conflict
Some may thing that is a conservative vs
progressive fight, but the real truth is that the unsolvable divide is those who eat their tortilla without onions and those filthy savages that add onions
So you are saying that in the next 10-15 years, if we don't do what Argentina has been doing for decades then Spain will become another Argentina
Doesn't make any sense
You are even willing to pay much more for technology like argentinians do (not just mobiles, everything involving technology), I don't think everyone agrees with you
How about copying what prosperous countries do instead
Reforms, a labor market adapted to the economy and not the other way around, a sustainable deficit, ... Countries that constanltly resort to currency devaluation to fix their deficit are all them in an endless crisis, that's not a model to follow
Let's take as inspirations populations that a few decades ago were vey poor and are now prosperous because the government focused on business development instead of populism
Let's be humble instead of looking for magical macroeconomic formulas that never worked
Sure
That was exactly my point
This happens everywhere within countries
Now, my other point, was that the disconnect between EU regions (north vs south) is way bigger than the disconnect between country regions (e.g.: Catalonia-Rest of Spain, or as you say, within Germany)
We may disagree here, but I don't think people from say, the Netherlands, will be happy with a fiscal union where there is constant (and bigger than now) wealth transfer between the north of the EU and the south
The thing is prosperous countries didn't start their journey with a 20% unemployment rate and a debt of 100% of their GDP
If you point out a country that started with those numbers and ended up as a prosperous country I'd love to follow their lead
Then don't hinder businesses development and employment with so much estate intervention in the labour market and client politics
It doesn't matter if you start with 20%, 10% or 5% unemployment
I give you an extreme case, post-war west Germany, they grew very fast with a strong currency
I don't know, I am no fortune teller
But I don't think a fiscal union is possible in the medium term given the current environment
And millions flowing with the Marshall plan, you forgot to mention
And what's your point
Spain will receive tones of subsidies after the recent agreement, plus all the cohesion funds in the 90s. But you rather leave the EU to devalue a local currency, punish savers, scare investors and become another Argentina
This was made by someone from Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia
I will lead a Confederation of Breweries Provinces
I hope we can count on some support from Central Europe

Checkmate
From a cultural point of view one is French while the other is basque
These maps always come across as arbitrary anyway
A British show could be filmed in northern Spain because its looks different than southern and central Spain in terms of environment and weather
That's clearly the case, like North Korea
New Zealand
The UK is a world power
It has a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, nuclear capabilities, is a member of the G8, home to the financial capital of the world, is a diplomatic top player, and a cultural powerhouse
London's GDP alone is almost five times bigger than New Zealand's.
We are on the way too
End the coronavirus quickly
The US wont turn that corner until they recognize all comparable countries (China, Spain, and Italy) had to take far more extreme confinement measures to begin to turn a corner
The US has piecemeal measures that differ across states and cities
Even where the confinement is serious it's nowhere near as serious as in Spain and Italy
We’ll see how long that lasts
Apparently a single request post can include several delete requests
As much as we banter each other, in times like this I feel European over all things, stay strong we are together in this shit, they won't destroy the europe we want to build
It’s a French problem, not a European one
I appreciate the solidarity, but beheading and shooting rarely happen anywhere else in Europe

>· Eating bread without tomato is a crime

Obviously the entire flag doesn't fit in the picture like in many others, but it's clearly the Aragon flag

You are taking things way to serious in a thread aimed to "trigger" Europeans in a funny way ;)
His name is Esteban González Pons if anyone one is interested, he has had other great speeches
This should be pinned in this sub like
forever
It's a /r/europe's boner
Stop making sense Pons, I don't like to agree with you
To be honest I do not understand why Spain is so pro Europe, don't get me wrong I support UE strongly, it's just a curious thing
"Europa limita al norte con el populismo,
al sur con los refugiados ahogados en el mar
Al este con los tanques de Putin,
al oeste con el muro de Trump".
It's a poem
Different parliamentary groups and lots of people give lots of very passionate speeches about things all day long
Though this one is about a cause Verhofstadt agrees with to his core
Someone has to say it for it to happen
Believe it or not, and I am not, but you can be right-wing plus very europeist
Those are not exclusive
Same reason why there are very pro-independence people and some of those still are be very europeist
I agree but I don't mind upvoting even if he's an hypocrite just because I don't care who is the one saying it: the truth is truth and all what he said is something you can agree with just like I agree with you now
Just my opinion, and probably a wrong statement, but I think most of us don't really like our country, and feeling more 'included' in Europe makes us feel kind of better
It's just a bad translation
He actually meant it was totally unselfish
They are actually pretty reasonable in Brussels/Strasbourg
They don't have an network of old friends to funnel money too there and there isn't much in the way of directly awarding contracts
Worth remembering that the most anti-EU major party in Spain is Podemos, and they're still very much pro-EU
I'm not sure if we don't like our country or we just like to point everything that is wrong so we can make it better
I mean, we talk very badly about Spain, but then a foreign person do it and we are ready to rise the Cruz de Borgoña.
I'd say we point everything that is wrong just because
Well, also because Iglesias' self-interest is to make it look as if the only parties in Spain are PP and Podemos
It's snowing right now in Barcelona, wtf
Not enough for it to settle of course, but still
It is snowing in Madrid again, but it is melting when it reaches the ground :(

Battery died because of the cold

we were late for work
Also it's snowing in my town
When it snows in my town, it's an apocalypse in the rest of europe
I didn't expect the balkans  to be so cold

This looks like a stock photo
Where is this located in the city
There's a few buildings like this in London - not sure if the rail track/bridge is older than the building, but I find them ugly as hell
!WishToKnowMore
It's a lot more futuristic than Madrid
Gotta spend those monarch points
Nothing personally against the Spanish royals, but I'd prefer a Republic with a President similar to Portugal's. The monarchy can only provide powerless masters of ceremonies
Might as well have an elected head of state with actual power
One is not like the others
On top of that: Norway's look like the cool manager at the office
Sweden's looks like the boss that seems tough at first but then is quite sensible
Denmark's is an actor playing the role of a prince
Parasites, all of them
In Spain, Monaco and Liechtenstein the males still get preference, we had debates about this and they even tried to change it but it was somewhat hard to do (i don't know why) so they just ignored the problem to this day, the King already said he's not gonna make more babies so Leonor will probably be the next Queen
EDIT: The law says that a boy can replace a girl if this girl was not the Princess of Asturias yet, but Leonor is already the princess, so no one can replace her
The US is kind of a monarchal-looking democracy
Things like the political dinasties or the role of _First lady_ which is completely non existent in other countries (I have no idea who ours is or her name) are very reminiscent
> (i don't know why)
Because it needs a constitutional change, and in Spain you will have an easier time getting the politicians to lower their salaries and publicly reveal all their income than to have them agree that the constitution must be changed *and* agree in the details of the change
If Infanta Sofia had been born a boy they probably would have bitten the bullet and changed it, but since she cooperated everybody could breathe again and push the problem onto the next generation, as is Spanish tradition
Reforming the preliminary title, first title, the second title, and the last title, are the elements that require massive consensus:
-2/3 of the Chamber
-2/3 of the Senate
-Elections
-Ratification by 2/3 of the new Chamber
-Ratification by 2/3 of the new Senate
-Ratification by referendum
Any of those fails, and the reform is over
> there's no real power attached
I know, but she's kind of a big deal and has a public and relevant profile, exactly like the queen/king spouse
In Spain no one knows who the First Lady is, she's irrelevant to the public
> For example the spouse of the German President does the exact same things the American First Lady does
I missed a "many" before that "other countries". Anyway, I have absolutely no idea so correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the role of the German President the same as our king
Kind of representative or so
In the US there isn't that split between PM and President so I was thinking more about spouses of PMs, like the one who gets things done
For the rest of the articles on the Constitution, it would require a 3/5 majority in the Chamber, and ratification by a 3/5 majority in the Senate
However, you are right
That was fast
Oh,poor France
I am triggered just looking at it, I don't even want to think what they are feeling right now,
I'll make sure tell a Russian v.1
Wait, why would the term "latino" annoy spaniards
The term is often used to refer to those who speak Spanish so there is nothing wrong with it
100% garantee nobody in Spain will give a fuck
I don't get irritated when called Latino, south Americans are *Hispanics*, Spanish and Italians are latiniums
Would calling Finland Scandinavian count
I feel like we're the only ones that don't offend anyone by speaking Spanish in Portugal because it's very, very clear that we know they aren't the same thing, but you DO understand us
It is just people who associates latino with Latinamerica, but if I said "la comunidad latina" I would be refering to Latinamerica and Spain
Ahh
so the true trick to making things awkward for a Finn is go in for the kisses on greeting
I mean, I can't really say anything because we just don't understand anything when you guys talk
I feel like an asshole because I just speak at people in Portugal and don't even worry about what people say back because I won't get it anyway
Italian fucks with my brain
I'll get whole sentences and then just won't understand anything in the next sentence
I mean, my go to phrase is
"eu falo portuñol que é falar em español com un accento exagerado" or something like that
I've been around Portugal a fair amount so I kind of get it, but it's still hard and I got just about zero the first time
Also, just doing Portuguese Duolingo for like a month is enough to deal with Portuguese just fine for a Spanish speaker
It could also include them, in fact, "los pueblos latinos" in something common in History books
Yeah, but if you guys learn Spanish, you basically get Catalan thrown in for free

Well the overall situation here is not very different than what we've seen in Italy
Overall people do respect the distance when queuing in the supermarket and they allow elderly and vulnerable people to go in first
Many many young people have volunteer in their neighborhoods to go buy the stuff of the elderly that live alone or have no one to take the basic stuff for them etc
I'm in Madrid, which is the most affected region by far, although other regions such Catalonia or Basque Country are following close, especially considering per capita statistics in the second case

*The mayor, Ana Mula, has reported that last Monday she instructed the Department of Social Welfare and Families to draw up a list of people over 70 living alone to contact them all in order to offer them help
"We are asking them if they need food, medicine or to walk their pet, to offer them this help from municipal staff," he said
*To this end, the municipal body has made available to this program two direct phone numbers of the Department of Social Services, 952 58 25 44 and 952 46 07 50, in addition to the three enabled by the City Council itself for public attention during these days of health alert, 952 58 93 00, 952 58 93 01 and 952 58 93 02

So proud of being European
As a Spaniard who has seen the rise of unemployment and desindustrialization since the country entered the EU, many of those are debatable
At least I can leave my country to use my skills trained with money paid by the Spanish government to work in Germany and make that country even richier

Can I still marry some hawt bulgarian in Spain
pls
Surrogacy is a completely different matter, with its own set of separate ethical problems that are nowhere near as clear cut as the matter of marriage equality is; that as a matter of coincidence happens to affect the "equality" of same-sex marriages in a practical manner
I just wanted to point this out in the midst of this debate, because the subtext of that phrase seems to be that by not outright opening the legal floodgates for surrogacy, such countries are being somewhat "backwards".
Hey

I'm for nuclear, but it's not renewable

What's renewable or not is the source, not the materials used to create the powerplants needed to extract it
Renewable =/= ecologically friendly
>>Wood is renewable
>Yeah and it's so good for the environment
I don't know if you're being sarcastic, but again, renewable doesn't mean pollution free
>>What's renewable or not is the source, not the materials used to create the powerplants needed to extract it
>Huh
You were talking about cobalt and solar and wind
>> You were talking about cobalt and solar and wind
But, no, the materials needed to produce the energy of are clearly resources, and it's stupid to think that they aren't.

You’re right
Good thing about the city is you have mountain and beach like ~1h apart from each other
Whether it’s a cold day of winter or a hot summer day you can choose where to go to find the weather you prefer
Oh rly
Me too
This pic was made a few days ago with the first snow of the season
Hope this year snow in the city too~
Lol
This summer I went to Porto, first time in Portugal
I fell in love with the city, the country, the food and the people
Sure
it was taken from the courthouse "La Caleta" even though the perspective google maps offers you is not so fair, trust me when I say that's what you see when you stand right in that spot
"Dale limosna, mujer

Its called Granada because of the fruit (pomegranate
), not because of the weapon lmao
I live here
Do people actually believe we're a tropical climate or something
Isn't that illegal
Sup medium bro
No, lifts are close and it doesnt seem that they will be able to open
Granada is a very small city, I think 3/4 days are enough to see everything
Definitely you must see the Alhambra and Generalife, Cathedral, Capilla Real, Sacromonte caves, Cartuja and take a walk around the city ^^
I should finish my grade in scotland

Serious answer, it's the loan system
You are guaranteed a loan at a reasonable rate and then once you graduate you only have to pay back after you reach a certain income threshold so it's not an undue burden
The result is that the system is financed by its own success and not by taxing poor people to give the money to rich people (which is what free college is)
Those numbers are going to be large if they are government funded or not so might as well have the people that make the most money from the education pay for it
The super rich understand the importance of cash flow versus total spend and that the rates are pretty good compared to long term investments so it'd be smarter to take the loans even if you had a lump sum
Same reason super reach people take mortgages
Then she has more money out and won't pay them all back before they're written off
That's a good thing
But it's not debt that you have to pay if you don't make money
The system increases access to poor people
That would be cheap to an American shopping for university
> In Denmark where I am from, university is free and you get financial support from the govt
and we have some of the highest upward social mobility in the world
That may be true, but in the case of college education you are taking money from the uneducated and giving it to the educated
If you correlate that to income, that means taking from the poorer people to give to wealthier people
Now, you may like that system and I would imagine most people posting here have benefited from  from it so will probably like it more
But recognize that it's upward redistribution
Would I like for someone else to have paid for my education
Absolutely, I'd think it's great
Then I'd get to keep a lot more money for myself, but the fact is that the education is what made me able to get all the extra money so it's only fair that I pay for it and not make some low income person who didn't benefit pay for it
> So for a short while the university student has his/her education paid for by everyone - including the uneducated - but afterwards they contribute in taxes for the healthcare, childcare, eldercare, unemployment for the uneducated
You could use the same argument to subsidize businesses so they are able to grow to produce more taxes
Somehow I don't think you feel the same way
Let me guess, it was bombed and got renovated
I lived in France for more than 5 years, I'm still using "putain" instead of "joder" even if I left the country 7 years ago, cannot help it, it comes out straight from my soul
I think it's the way the French pronounce it, with such passion and despair even for petty stuff, it's contagious
In Spain I've heard "putas" as a "fuck" alternative
Yeah, porra is both a food and an insult
Carajo also means that in Spanish and it has a fun story
Sailors would be punished by being sent to the *carajo*, the highest mast on the ship, which would make them seasick and feel lonely
Now that you mention it, I have found a lot of coincidences between French and Italian words
Sort of as if they were two divergences from one common root, something akin to relatives within one family
My guess is when the anunnaki created Italy, they sort of based it on the ancestor of France: colder, rainier climate in the North, drier, Mediterranean in the South, a penchant for higher forms of music, overindulge in tragic passions, the dolomites are a bootleg version of the French Alps, the Apennines are clearly based on the Pyrenees, Rome is like a more humble version of Paris, Italian cuisine like a fast food version of French one etc
The language is just another example
And a weapon
I giggled at "For Now". How long has it been there
In Spain we have Guarromán! It's a curious evolution of an arabic word, but in today's Spanish, "guarro" means "disgusting" or "someone who does dirty things". "Man" doesn't mean anything in Spanish, but thanks to Superman, Batman and Spiderman, we now have a town named after the worst superhero of all: [Disgustingman

And also our names, including California
Just joking
But it is most likely that the style of architecture was brought by the conquistadores at the time
This type of construction (narrow streets with white finishing) is very good for very hot places, such as California
In fact, the location with the highest average amount of precipitation in Spain is in Andalusia (Sierra de Grazalema, Grazalema's mountainous system)
Also the driest region in Spain is also in the south, in the region of Murcia
The biggest ski resort in Spain is also located in the south (Sierra Nevada natural park)
etc
What I mean is that the south of Spain is much more diverse and susceptible to the time of the year than people might expect at first
Without knowing the exact location we cannot know how are the conditions and if these roads are necessary or just a vestige of older times (which is of course a possibility)
Most likely they just didn't put that much thought into it
They built a standard sidewalk x meters wide beside each house and didn't stop to think about the space left in between
Andalucia is your typical videogame world, you have a lot of biomes in a "small" place

\-Cave systems
\-Windy town (Tarifa)
\-Modern cities

She wanted this to be voted on the next parliament, because she was betting on the good results of the elections
She did slip in the sense that SPD took her words, and reading the play, decided to push it known that the majority of the Bundestag supports this piece of legislation

>Military commands>Governor of Netherlands (1567-1573)
>Development>War with the Netherlands
That's a decent read on the guy sent, note that most Spanish furies were carried out by his son, but he is the one feared
Also, a link with what historians consider was unfair criticism (not much)
This council judged both those considered rebels and those clerics "expanding the heresy".
>According to historical writer Jonathan Israel, almost nine thousand people, from all levels of society, were convicted of heresy or treason
As most of these were tried in absentia, however, only about 1,000 of these sentences were carried out
The other convicts had to live in exile, their possessions confiscated
This is the list of different sacks and violent sieges by the Spanish troops
Ordered by commanders or by mutineers
>It is important to distinguish the so-called "Spanish Furies" in 1572 from the Spanish Fury at Antwerp in 1576, as these were explicitly ordered by the military commanders, while the sack of Antwerp was perpetrated by mutinous troops
It ain't really shorter

That is surprising, because the EU sets a minimum criterion, not a maximum
Countries are allowed to have stricter rules, but not weaker
In this case, if the NL wanted to have stricter rules about the protection of net neutrality, I would have thought that it wouldn't be in conflict with the EU
Do you know why is like that in this case
Do you have a source
Ok, no killing
But we can still invade Poland, right
Why is England so poor in trees

They won see it because "freedom".

The change from pesetas to euros in Spain was badly made
But even with that shit change we are better with Euros in the long run
Some countries only like the EU when it comes to receiving economic help and military/political support against Russia
But then they do not want to support the common economic and social project that the EU is
Those countries people's are ought to think about what they are doing, because if they keep being like that and someday we grow tired of them

Why Spain is divided in many balls but Germany doesn't even have Bavaria
It's great
I doubt they can do that under EU treaties
Supermarkets themselves could
Also, Poland exports plenty to other EU too, they would fight back
The biggest agricultural winner in the EU is France with its subsidies
Farmers in colder/poorer EU areas are often angry that they have to compete against subsidized old Europe
Also true, but the idea of EU is free market for goods through our borders, hence it's normal that cheaper product "wins".
Great work
Just to be obnoxious, Spain's mountains are really weird in your map
Check this out:
The Meseta is a word meaning something like "table" (plateau, to be more specific)
Mountain ranges should be around or across the Meseta, not form the Meseta itself (which should be in the center of the peninsula, not in the northeast)
The northern Cordillera Cantábrica (somehow a continuation of the Pyrenees along the Atlantic coast) should go along the west-northeast Sistema Central and the north-southwest Sistema Ibérico
Then, just end the map with the southwestern almost coastal Sistemas Béticos
I really like your map and think this improvement would make it better
Don't consider it an attack or an underappreciation, please
Where do you think Ikea got all that wood from, uh
Came here to say this
It looks wonderful but the meseta is very wrong
I live there and, trust me, no mountains here
It also places Madrid in a valley surrounded left and right by mountains when that's not the case
The Sistema Central lie north to north-west of Madrid
In /u/metalpotato's map it'd be roughly on the C of Central
It does look amazing but that mistake is very jarring when you know the area

Nope its true lol
As a complete aside, have you ever heard him speaking Spanish

Luckily then I went to grab the free hot chocolate and saw that he was hidden behind the nativity :D

The world doesn't care about your ultranationalist fantasy
I have upvoted this post because I love Catalonia as much as any other part of Spain, I consider every person of Catalonia a citizen of my own country
You can't, and won't, steal Catalonia nor Valencia from the rest of Spaniards, nor from all the Catalans and Valencians who consider themselves Spaniards and who love Spain
Yes, Spain has everything to do with this, because it was created by an administration that is part of the Spanish state
No, it's up to the Spaniards to decide what our nation is, from Galicia to Catalonia and from Andalusia to the Basque Country
The Basque Country is as mine as yours, and so is Catalonia
That's what the Constitution says
Ok, everyone who disagrees with you is a fascist
The reality is that Spanish people have no problem with Catalans
The only ones who have a problem are separatists who hate Spain
Speaking Catalan in the Congress in Madrid
And not being able to do that is cultural imposition

This is kind of iffy, because in Spain suicide rates are not made public, supposedly to avoid encouraging other suicidal people
It's also a great way to hide the problem, but I'm unsure wether that is intentional
Why do men kill themselves more than women
I'm from northern Spain and even I feel a change in my mood when I visit south
It's often an underrated variable I think
If I recall correctly they also have a higher life expectancy
Having a higher rate of depression as an illness probably caused by weather conditions (?) doesn't that the average person who is lucky to not have that illness is more happy than the average person in other places with lower depression rates
What I mean is that maybe we should dissociate depression and just being sad or happy
As depression is an illness that may be caused for different reasons
And depression may lead to suicide more frequently that just being sad
I don't think I've explained myself right, but anyway it's just a supposition, so I will be probably wrong anyway
I’m sorry, we kinda need that, tourism and stuff, I’m sure you guys understand
You’re more than welcome to come see it tho
If men suicide attempts are not reported, how do you know it
They report to you but not to the social services
Idk, your supposition reads like some big stereotype: serious men with real problems vs girls just want some attention
I'm going to need some data to believe that women do more "fake suicide attempts" only for attention and sympathy
I mean, depression is a serious thing for both men an women, I don't see it being so trivial as just wanting attention for any of them
Usually the southern European lower rates are related to sociocultural and climate stuff
The Mediterranean way of life is more relaxed, less mindful of criticism, less stressful and more hedonist than the rest of Europe's
On the other hand, deeply religious communities usually don't acknowledge suicide as such to avoid stigmatisation
It happens less and less and only in rural areas, but it's more common in the south and east of Europe
Don't be malo, they need our sun to vivir
They may also be struggling but I don't think that mentally wise it is fully comparable taking your life in a violent, brutal way like shooting yourself in the mouth (if you destroy your face you really have to hate yourself, or don't have anyone you care of who may see the corpse) than taking a couple of pills and call the ambulance as he says
So maybe he didn't choose the right wording but he has a point
Also some of those women do that several times a year, so I'm not sure if this is the case but their counting can be a bit tricky
So you see 1000 attempts and it is maybe only 800 people, for instance, whether for 1000 "successful" suicides you really know it is 1000
This is the approach for companies that heard about the GDPR 2 yearsago, said "its plenty of time left" and yesterday went like "what do you mean it is tomorrow
Also, supposing your country had some legislation that required you to give consent for, say, double opt in for email verification, companies do not have to send you a email to get your consent again, because consent was given with the previous law, but most companies got that part wrong and sent the mail begging for consent anyway (more power to us, honestly)
Here in Spain the application of the law has been on the disastrous side, moreso for some big comapnies which should know better

In most European countries you can't own an automatic weapon or a handgun

It is just myself only that feels this castles look nothing like they used due to their restorations, and they look out of place
Neuschwanstein castle was never a castle, defensve or not
It is a fake historicity building from 1869
These decorations were added to defensive castles long after the need for a fortified fortress in that spot, and in this particular case, the actual castle was razed and turned into a ruin in 1617 for rebellion of its owner
It then was one of the many buildings restored by Viollet-le-Duc (the man who restored Notre Dame) in the 19th century

But would that also because the whole EU thing was completely different in the 70's to what it is now
in Spain we lost all pretensions of being an empire after we lost Cuba in 1898
If this looks more like a fantasy castle than an actual castle, that's because it's exactly what it is
It was ordered by Ludwig II of Bavaria, called "The Fairy Tale King". He loved fantasy works, he was more interested in art than in government and he was also gay
Perhaps a man born out of time, but he left us a great legacy, like this castle, or his patronizing of much of Wagner's later work, which perhaps wouldn't have been written without his support

We have them over here too and no one with money buys them
They are cheaper alternatives to local cars, maybe better in some regards but not on the level of BMW or Mercedes
Europeans do not buy more German cars than French, Swedish or Romanian
Germany tops the luxury car market, but it isn't by far the most bought cars among the plebs, specially as you move further away from Germany
Jajajaja
I think the correct translation is Joanna
It's generally translated as Joanna the Mad
It seems that today I cannot put two things together properly
Thank you for the information
Cant say I saw many in my life
Luxury cars are almost always Mercedes, Audi or Porsche
Norway is beautiful wherever you go
lmao this is why so many of actually have no idea about politic
alienating turkey, shifts the politics or middle east, entirely to Russia’s favor
why do you thinl turkey is part of NATO and not EU
NATO is a response to (now) Russian geopolitical moves, we need Turkey because of its geographical position and its political influence in balkans and middle east
Unfortunately, Turkey knows this and there’s really nothing we can do while maintaining a position over russia
I remember when may was a jk to everyone
now all uk is going to miss her lol
It's a pity that Britain, which used to command the world, is now reduced to this
What a bizarre mix Spain has
That age range matches people who were in their twenties in the 2008 crisis and the property bubble
There was insane demand to build more and more, mostly in touristic places
Salaries were as insane even for the simplest worker to funnel people into the building sector to satisfy the demand
Most young people in touristic and/or poor areas left school ASAP to take those jobs
When the bubble exploded and construction of new buildings stopped, they found themselves with no qualification and no job
This map is news to me, but tbh there is this mindset in Spain that if you are not going to college, just get a job and quit wasting your time
I just didn't know it was that spread
Unemployment and low quality jobs (lack of industry is a big factor) . Studying is usually not worth it if you don't plan on immigrating to richer regions as you'll find yourself with 25 or more years with no job experience, no money and if you ever find any kind of job you would make little more than 1000 €.
It is different here bc till 16
Grade it is mandatory so it is like that
Whet we call secondary is up to 18 and are courses that prepare to un or grados medios that don’t let you enter for university but they prepare for specific professions
Sorry for my English
And the north has harder exams
It isn't. You are looking at the numbers of 30-34 year olds: The generation that were on their teens when the construction bubble was at its height
Many of those left school as soon as possible to earn a lot of money in the construction
A glance at the results now explains why when the bubble exploded Spain had such a bad time trying to recover: In the sough we had a literal generation that ended up with no job and no studies
There are a lot of problems in the world that are worse that autocorrect, but few of them are more irritating
Come to  heaven on earth 'Spain', English people
That saturation boost

I suspect there are few things the Irish will not forget if they will irritate or embarrass the english

>The prime minister wants to hold talks about a fresh deal but the EU needs to "rethink" its "current refusal" to make any changes to the withdrawal agreement, Downing Street added
Is this the "no u" of high-tier politics
I am so tired that they try to make Europe seem the bad guy
I cannot even understand this
Rethink the current refusal so you can vote it another bazillion times in the British Parliament
UK doesn’t really need Europe
There are countless of other countries the can partner with
UK is militarily and politically very strong with or without the EU
Their status as a permanent member of U.N. Security council, possession of nuclear, and invaluable intelligence will make them big player on the world stage for a long time
The reason there isn’t a good Brexit deal is because deep down all of the UK knows that there is nothing wrong with the EU
Instead of trying to change the way the EU works and working to restructure it so that countries have more autonomy, they just left
The EU has problems but it’s also a pretty good deal too
If England really believed it would be significantly better off by itself, a Brexit deal wouldn’t be so important to them
It’s goes back to the saying “just because you can doesn’t mean you should”, England will probably be fine but it’s just super unnecessary when you balance everything out

My mom is an experienced hobby mountaineer and she was trekking up a mountain in the Pyrenees in Spain and halfway up she met a dutch couple and the poor man was exhausted sitting on a rock by the side of the path and my mom said hi and asked if they were alright and the poor man could only say in a very rudimentary spanish: "I come from the Netherlands
aaaall flat
So it became a family's inside joke: now when we are tired sometimes we say "aaaaaall flat" (in spanish with a dutch accent) :P

We Spaniards would like to show the oldest operating lighthouse in the world: the Tower of Hercules, in Galicia
It was built in the 1st century AD
That's a compass rose, yes
It's pretty cool and the view is espectacular
There's a lot of people

Well yeah, otherwise I don't see why else you'd be mad at Irish people wanting unity
Then ignore it, from what I've seen most threads about Ireland there are usually very few 1 upvote comments about unity and if it makes them happy then sure they could go for it
As long as nobody is calling for violence, in which case I'd agree with you
Turkey is strangely empty
I didn't know Crimea had so many people
I am moving to Norway
It's almost an inverse population density map for Spain
I'm guessing because there's just so many small municipalities in the center
And they are basically all organized so they will have at least around 1000 since they will put several towns in the same municipality
Which isn't the case on reality
I would guess that if the map is correct, there are villages of 1001 people evenly distributed, instead of concentrated on small areas
Props to the 1% that doesnt know that france exists
I have the feeling Spain got that rating because we are a nice vacation place
The British love britain the most
Why is Spain so high
Do they really love our beaches so much
Im really proud of my country, Spain
I recommend you all to visit us, tourism is pretty safe right now, specially because hotels and beaches are 100% desinfected and almost empty due to COVID19 fear
My vacations this year, have been one of the best i have ever had here in Spain
You're less well known, I guess
Norway is closer, Sweden is more popular, and Germany is overwhelming
So you're kind of in the middle
UK still salty that their counterarmada didn't get Portuguese to fight the Spanish as promised
You're not supposed to look at the yellow thing directly
Gibraltar shenanigans
Most disliking you it's because of tourists being kinda dirty and a bit chaotic

Norway always looks so freaking breath-taking
It makes me want to pack my things and go live there in that little cabin the rest of my existence
I love the way Finnish people improve *literally*  anything by adding Heavy Metal to it
Same energy as the extreme ironing competitions
This is the reason why Spain gained so much experience in building public infrastructures
When building motorways or high speed lines they always try to find a natural path for it, but sometimes that's not possible and they have to build some long tunnels and viaducts:
No need to worry about sea level

I worry about Brexit because I have plenty of British friends who are afraid and I share their pain
Besides that, I solidarize with my fellow British workers, who are going to pay for what I think will be a disaster
At the end of the day, a good British worker is closer and more important to me  than Amancio Ortega or Emilio Botin
If I didn't care about the future of many in the UK, I wouldn't care about Brexit either
How do people even survive in the purple areas
It's weird how 1 or 2 weeks ago Russia was in the 30s/40s and Spain was in the 10s/20s, and now it's the other way around

Lol I agree with you so hard
I always wonder how it survived the bombing of Rome in 1943-1944 so relatively unharmed
It's all over northern Europe

Is that enough time
I don't think Johnson is doing that only to see the remainers stop no deal in two weeks
>Is there any sort of Brexit deal on the table that is acceptable to Parliament and to the EU
Short answer: no
Long answer: the debate around the UK-EU relationship post-Brexit involves three things:
* Will there be a border between the UK (or at least Great Britain) and the EU
No border means common market, border means the UK can freely negotiate trade agreements with third countries (like the USA, hi Trump)
* Will there be a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
No border means NI must be inside the EU common market, border means trouble because of the IRA
* Will there be a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain
No border means NI and GB must have the same status, for good or for bad
Border means NI and GB have a different status
The problem here is that Brexiters actually want three things:
They want a border between the UK/GB and the EU
They want no border between NI and the Republic of Ireland
They want no border between NI and GB
And that's simply impossible
You can only pick two of them, but you must leave the other one out
Why
Because different markets need hard borders between them, and same market means no border
For example:
* If you take 1 and 2, you get GB isn't part of the EU market but NI is
Then, to separate the EU market and the GB market, there must be a border between NI and GB, so no 3
* If you take 1 and 3, you get the entire UK (GB and NI) isn't part of the EU market, then, to separate the UK market and the EU market, there must be a border between NI and RI, so no 2
* If you take 2 and 3, you get RI and NI are part of the same market and NI and GB are part of the same market, the EU market, then, you have no border between the UK and the EU, so no 1
Theresa May wanted the three of them and that is simply impossible
Now Boris Johnson has even given up negotiating and is going for a no deal
No deal means 1 and 3
There will be a border between NI and RI
Can someone explain this
I mean what it is
I'm sorry but the night train from Madrid to Lisbon is awful
the reason they voted out was a combination of the refugee crisis, and people like nigel farage convincing britons that their lives are shit (1) and it's because of immigrants (2)
nevermind having among the highest gdp per capitas, lowest unemployment rates and fewest reception of refugees in the eu
fuck the brits for buying into that
A german dude told me not to bother learning german but improving my english
In Spain we just make you pronounce hard words for your language to have fun
Say "jarra". Now "ron" wait wait now say "rocódromo"
Then we teach them how to properly curse
for english speakers I teach them with "e how d put e"
everything with a soft "r" like "carta" or Z "zapato, cerveza
Well, it's your Spanish heritage, depending on the region it's "co", "chacho", "Acho", "rapaz", "pisha", "quillo" etc
I can feel the spirit of the sea people
What an amazing fact
It's an average
If it was the median, it would probably be lower since the typical earner nets within the range of about 20-25k euro a year
> Fun fact but plane tickets there are twice as expensive to Asia than to USA which I find funny because both are roughly the same distance
Get to a city served by Emirates and Qatar and look from there
Be amazed at how cheap it can be to fly to Asia through magic of competition
Finnair also has a lot of capacity to Asia
> we get only 26 days per year so changing plane means I effectively sacrificed 1 - 2
5 weeks of vacation is plenty to be able to sacrifice a few days for transportation
I'm aware
I also work
I just used 15 days for a trip to Japan
Of course I would have liked more but that was plenty of time and managed to see Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima and plenty of day trips from there
it seems they're paid in potatos too
Also Gaudí didn't leave detailed plans for it which complicates things as we want it to be close to what he once envisioned
Their budget has also increased a lot in recent years
In 2019 it was ~100M€, with ~50 allocated to construction
They basically have zero issues with financing, which is usually the limiting factor
Don't worry, by the time it is finished the restoration works will start
How we left behind West Sahara and Equatorial Guinea people in the 70s, who spoke Spanish and held Spanish IDs at the time
I’m not very familiar with the root causes and would like to read more about it though
Political turmoil caused by the imminent Franco’s death played a major role though
It became a tradition among some people here to bring in West Sahara children over for summer holidays every year
Nowadays (40 years after the dictatorship ended) there are still way over 100
000 missing people in Spain who have been murdered by Franco's regime, and they are presumed to be buried in mass graves all around the country
Some corpses have been recovered over the years, but the great majority hasn't even though we actually know where many of these mass graves are
Some families don't even know where their relatives are to this day
I came to say the same
It still happened at least 1990
My friend is still trying to find his youngest sister
this is a known fact in spain, usually used to show how tolerant is spain with its regions compared to france
Most of them dissapeared while Franco ruled , they were  actually murdered for opposing his views . They usually kidnapped them , shot them and then buried them on the side of a road
I wish more people found this to be horrifying here in Spain
Sadly, some (right wing) people do not want to discuss this issue and criticise those who do, saying that they "live in the past" or "are only looking for revenge" when they just want to properly bury their loved ones before they die themselves
We still have a long way to go to reject and recover from the dictatorship 40 years later, and in my opinion there's no way we are doing that when people's relatives are literally still burried in ditches
i didnt know about this topic
Wait, so you don't let Zeus and the olympians decide on legal matters
Who ??
As far as I know, the francoists took the children of poor families, many suspected of being sympathetic to the anti-fascist cause, so that rich people (who were fascists 99
9% of the time) could raise them
I wouldn't be surprised if it was a common way of silencing dissent in the long run used in other dictatorships
I think it was more of a "guys, we got enough shit in our plate here" and Morocco saw the opportunity to put pressure on West Sahara (see the famous [Green March] so we just packed our shit and left them there
It is one of the many reasons we have *complicated* relations with Morocco to this very day

Felipe González, our third president in democracy

Those islands are ok, don’t care about them, but Ceuta and Melilla are not colonies but an integral part of Spain that happen to be in the North African coast
When they compare with Gibraltar is just ridiculous
You have to go nearly 700 (years) back to find some kind of settlement there from the Berber, and not even any kind of Moroccan Kingdom existed so their claims are certainly thinly based
Not Moroccans, their kingdom didn't exist yet
It was the Almoravid and Almohad empires (of berber origin, I think)
Yep
It’s like saying that French Guiana must be part of Brazil just because they happen to be touching
Well, that's just hammering my point in
True, I dont know why morrocans would have any opinion on It , It makes more sense for the middle east to claim it
It's interesting how still it's addressed as a "reconquest"
Haha, I would like Portugal and Spain to join, so yes
I mean, one doesn't reconquest a city founded by the "occupiers" who happen to be living in some territory for centuries, what I'm trying to say is that the reconquista is one of those cases where history has been manipulated to follow a specific vision
People live in a place, invaders conquer and settle, the ones in the north start to make them flinch and claim the territories they had + new things built
I still see this as a reconquest
It's obvious that every win is manipulated to make it look bigger but everything has a logical base
The creation of new cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different
I don't understand why you say "It's interesting how still it's addressed as a reconquest ". Mate, are you wondering why the 700-year-old period we study known as **the Reconquista** is addressed like that
700 years, that's longer that the people that were living in the peninsula before (Visigoths, 300 years), how can you reconquer a place that didn't exist before
"New cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different" that is extremely vague, are you trying to compare an empty land to a city where people and culture developed
The reconquista is tried to be sold by some people of an "us against them" type of thing, and build over it a nationalist story of Spain for some reason
So you are telling me that the lands didn't exist before
When you conquer you don't need to have cities, you need to have the lands, settlements can develop through time
And what do you wanna prove with 700 years being bigger than 300
(If you don't want to consider the conquerors as Visigoth heirs) The battle was bigger than the initial stay, and
"New cities doesn't mean the lands are now extremely different" is extremely vague because it is just that
The creation of a village won't change anything, the lands of the ancestors are still those, because someone is staying there doesn't mean anything
I don't know why you focus on that point
You talk as if there were no other cities in the whole peninsula that weren't Al-Andalus
The reconquista is tried to be sold as "us against them" because the winners fought invaders and then united under a kingdom to **form SPAIN**. It is not hard to understand
You honestly seem to hate Spain
Speaking of culture, the Spanish-Muslim art of non-belligerent is quite interesting, I recommend everyone to take a look at it
No where I state lands didn't exist before, that's just a dumb idea that has nothing to do with what I said, cities made culture flourish, a culture that was much more rooted than the Visigoths (that's why I mentioned the 700 hundred years, much bigger impact), I'm not saying no other cities existed, what I'm trying to say is that yes, they invaded and conquered a new land and settled there, created a culture, entrenchment, and then the same thing happened again, there was a conquest, that's how things happened over and over, not that romantization of "multiple kingdoms joining to regain what's "theirs"? Why did it belong to them
, By the way, Spain as a country wasn't created until years later, that's what I'm referring to as why "the reconquista" has been manipulated for ideological reasons
"You honestly seem to hate Spain"-> This is plain stupid, because I don't buy the heroic tale some people try to tell as to how Spain was "formed"?, that doesn't equal "hate", is only trying to understand better history, trying to not fall under bias which is really difficult
the fun part is later some people in this country get surprised why some seek independence
I’d say that it’s called The Reconquista because muslims conquered christian lands, and then christians retook them
But I guess your point is that it has been fairytalisized too much, and that it’s much more complex than just a long war
I mean, if we are going to be assholes anyway, I won’t *obliterate* a country; I’d rather drain Doggerland in its entirety
The UK thinks it’s so special because it’s an island
Welcome to the continent bish
France loves it’s northern sea
What sea
The Netherlands is a seafaring maritime power
How tragic that they’re now *landlocked* :P
Portugal, just so we get 1200km of coastline for drunk tourists

No hard feelings, just chose the smallest country
If we end the UK would Gibraltar go down with them or would it still exist

If you've ever lived in a touristic part of Spain you'd know why

But please, allows us all to relocate first
It’s not our fault that our politicians are clowns
Portugal, just to unlandlock Extremadura and León.
Portugal
What about Andorra
I'm sure that many people here don't know where Andorra is
I think spanish people wouldnt have a problem living with our fellow portuguese friends
As long as they hate the french, we are fine with it
Isla Ibérica has a nice ring to it
Everyone in Galiza kinda knows how to communicate with portuguese people so that sounds good
What if you get Hans Island
Everybody is an organ donor by default, unless you declare yourself otherwise
So we used our natural lazyness for the greater good
Don’t know if related, but they’ve repeatedly tried to sell me drugs both in Porto and in Lisbon every time I’ve gone
Even when my family was right beside me
Portugal is the only country in the EU where I’ve seen so many people doing this
Had to check Twitter to verify it because it finally happened
The nth addition to the UK being a joke since 2016
As Spanish living and working in London for a financial company I've been suggested if I like Vancouver in Canada or Frankfurt in Germany
I think I'm going to try Vancouver
Apart from that, I don't know what to do with my GBP savings, I think I'm going to convert it to CAD or EUR once I know if they can send me to Vancouver (to Frankfurt is easy, is EU)
Why does he look like a bootleg Trump
You can use our balconies if you want, because you're quite fucked
As Spanish, I don't really think I like him, he has used us as anti-europe propaganda
we don't like  unprovoked attacks like that, what's more, it was a lie
>That's incredibly depressin
i used to think your democrazy was the bes working one in europe
then the referendum happened
Sorry my English doesn't go that far, what is "rad"?
No, oc not
It just seemed like the whole brexit campaign was based on lies
Targeting peoples feelings, blaming europe for things it didn't do
A campaign based on feelings, not facts

In the end i didn't live it
Sorry if i said something that bothered you, i didn't mean to
That time Napoleon said “Hey guys
We are friends right
I want to invade Portugal, can my soldiers go across Spain to get there
” and we said yes and Napoleon proceeded to invade us instead
Classic French
Never trust a baguette
In adittion to the classic Napoleon invasion, La armada invencible (Spanish Armada) and his sinking was a funny one
Absolutely true
Let's not forget Godoy inside a carpet trying to hide from a revolution

Ugly "soviet" style building with green canopy and pot in some tiny balconies
Unemployed or working in black
That's city poverty, rural one is different
Spain
There's a noticeable percentage of people living in true 3rd world conditions, but usually it's pocket communities made up of minorities, immigrants and chronically poor families
They live in "slums" like Cañada real
Still a shame for a country like ours
Then, we have a sizable amount of our population living in relative poverty
Usually in bad/low class neighborhood hit hard by deindustrialization in concrete or brick prefab low quality blocks built during the dictatorship or shortly after, where often 3 generations share a flat
They might not starve, and have access to TV and healthcare and education, but barely get by and face discrimination in many ways
Their children perform poorly at school and the system sinks them down
Lack of education leads to poor health habits and mental and physical illness
Not as much as in the 80s and 90s, but man do we have a problem with drugs
They have it very difficult to find liveable jobs (Spanish job market is utter crap for everybody, imagine for them), as much as it is criticised as oversized, our welfare is minimum compared to most European countries
Administration is very inefficient as well, and they are usually left behind
Many families live off the grandparents' pension
Then we have the "new poor", people that even working a "good" job and having support of family and friends still struggle to make ends meet
Happens more and more in the biggest cities with wages stagnant and rents skyrocketing
A junior engineer earning minimum wage is not unheard of at all
Minimum wage is 1000eur before taxes and social security
A flat deemed decent in Madrid is like 600-900
But needless to say, many work a full time job on a temporary contract, making barely that while the company tricks the state
[This] is officially the poorest neighborhood in Spain
The average salary is maximum 5k / year
Spanish perspective: you live in an old building, painting falling off the walls and ceiling
You and your whole family (if you have any) do any work you can find, without a contract of course because you can’t let the government take part of the 20€ that they gave you for picking strawberries last weekend
And if you have any accidents, they’ll leave you at the side of the road alone for you to find your way home, and deny that you ever worked for or with them
Your neighborhood is bad
Bad as in other people will do the impossible to avoid walking through it and even though you’re most likely used to it you’ll still fake having a knife in your pocket while walking (or even maybe have a real one who knows)
You’re also most likely not racist because you’ve been raised with families who were like yours and didn’t care about colour or nationality as long as you lived next to them and could play football together
There’s probably more but that’s all I can recollect
Not sure if in english they use "working in black". I think they use more "working under the table".
But ya, I would say poverty in Spain would be people working under the table while getting help of the local and national goverment, so not that bad
There is also this gipsy areas where they live in chabolas (shanty towns) and there is a lot of poverty too
Thanks for the correction, I wasn't really sure about being correct, but I didn't had time to look it up
Not for the common person in Spain
You could perfectly live without needing to speak a word of any other language but Spanish
Yep, every time I try to speak Valencian I end up mixing it with English
As a spanish living in catalonia i dont use spanish outside school, and didnt go to school for 4 months and now i feel like a shit typing in spanish
Not worse but more sluggish
Some words come to mind in english
And It happens quite a lot
I thinks it's because i consume more media in english than spanish
For one i almost exclusively write in english
I'm the opposite- I speak Spanish so much that my English is going to shit
Yeah, kinda
I mostly consume English media, and I go around on primarily English websites like this one
I often forget the Spanish translation for an English word in my head, so if I know my interlocutor will understand me I just say it in english
I do try to say it with a huge accent to make sure they understand me, and also bc it feels kinda dumb to suddenly start speaking with another accent mid sentence
I speak both languages fluently
There have been times in my life where I spoke one much better than the other
Right now I work in English (mostly) and speak English with my family at home, so my Spanish is slowly degrading
When I was a teen I spent most of my time speaking Spanish with friends and my English was much worse
As a spanish living in catalonia i dont use spanish outside school, and didnt go to school for 4 months and now i feel like a shit typing in spanish
Yes, I live in an English speaking country and I use Spanish less than an hour per week, most weeks
I can notice sometimes struggling to find the correct Spanish word or friends laughing because I fell for a “reverse false friend”
Well, the common person in Spain would have to know some English first
In Spain we have a very thick accent
Many of the sounds english have just don't exist in Spanish and they seem to vary a lot and pronuntiation looks random
we have an accent, but everyone has
I don't mind at all
And tbh I've  found that native english speakers care very little about it too
I don't like it, I think that all romance speaking countries are ashamed of their English accents, we usually have very notorious accents and we are not very good at English in general, so there's always some degree of shame when talking English
No, I don't, hadn't spoken English in my whole Life so my accent is as thick as t gets
Funny thing is I am Spanish but been in the US for five years studying
People in the US notice my accent right away but they are unable to tell were is from I studied in the south so I have picked up some slang words and different pronunciation
Last year I went to the UK for vacation and some of the people I interacted with kept asking me if I was American because of my accent which it confused me for a minute as I always thought I had a really strong accent but no where near American as some Americans had pointed out my accent themselves and never recognized it as one of their own
Some in the south think I’m from the north due to my accent, which is funny because I am from the north just not in their country
But in resumen I do like my accent
I don't mind it but people usually like it and fund it funny
I think it happens the same to all Spanish people
I am from Spain and no, I do not like it I would like to improve it with time
I dislike my accent, not because I have an Spanish accent but because I have some sort of weird Irish-English-US accent and people either think I’m an idiot for “trying too hard” or think I’m faking it
About the accent itself
I do like it, sounds great
Just to let you German people know, us natives love your accent
It's beautiful and you shouldn't be ashamed of it
Agreed
I'm an English Philologist, I work for an American company and, therefore, I use English daily to speak with customers and colleagues
I've studied abroad and 90% of the movies, TV shows, and videogames I watch and play are in English
But my Spanish accent will never disappear
I did a presentation in English last year in Paris and two different people came to me later and said "You're Spanish, right
Your accent gave you away" :(
Every speaker, native or otherwise will have an accent
Don't say that
I fucking love the dutch accent, when it has like an american touch to it
Maybe I'm weird
Greek sounds a lot like Spanish
Five vowels (I mean, there are only five letters, what was the problem with that, french/English people
) and a lot of consonants sound similar, even our strong R
I've met/worked many Greeks and Cypriot (from the Greek part) abroad that at first I though they were Spaniards because of the accent
I love it
It's kinda thick imo
We don't have as many vowels as you do so we struggle with that
I think this only happens in europe tho
Since english is just another language but we all use english to comunicate, the general agreement is that we won't give a single fuck about accents
But in latin america you see spanish speakers working very hard to ha e a perfect american accent
Down there having a good accent is important, here in europe we just agreed we don't care haha
The usual things are: inability to roll "Rs", inability to pronounce the z sound and more on a grammar topic you struggle so much with the verb tenses and conjugation (understandably since english grammar is so easy)
So basically the verbs and the r thing since the zzzz thing is not an all spanish thing
But the thing is I think spanish people are very generous and kind in that regard
If you say in the most broken spanish "hhhola, donde estar la museou de las artes" absolutely everyone will understand you because spanish pronuntiation and grammatical rules are perfectly defined by the rae
On top of what the other guy said:
"Making up" vowels
Our vowels are very simple, there's 5 of them and they're written as they sound
In English you have a myriad of vowels, of single letter vowels turning into two sounds (m**a**te), silent vowels (mat**e**), double vowerls turning into one sound (t**ou**gh), letters having multiple different possible sounds depending on the word
If you apply these rules to Spanish you mess it up immensely
It's much more simple than that
Realizing certain consonants like t or p with a puff of air is something really common as well and it sounds terrible
We don't have that puff of air in any word, so instead of saying your ts like "table" say it like "actor". Same for p, b, c/k...
For Spain's Spanish, please stick to one pronounciation of c/z: if you choose to pronounce c/z like th or like s then do it consistently but don't mix it up
I get so triggered when English speakers pronounce Zaragoza as Tharagosa
It's either Tharagotha or Saragosa, but stick to one
Also if you choose to pronounce it as an s, then it's an s, not an English buzzing z. We don't have that sound
English has such weird phonetics that virtually arguably any language with English accent sounds bad, and viceversa
I really don't know if i'd categorized that accent as spanish
She seems to have a sputh american spanish accent (maybe venezuela or colombia)
I'd say spanish accent (from spain) is different
It's one of those things that we don't understand
Stupid and estupid are the same hahah
That's what happens in Brussels where everybody is from a different country and no-one gives a crap
People just don't make an effort to lose the accent, it's beautiful that feeling of mutual respect and understanding
The puss in boots is a "forced" andalusian accent
Antonio banderas is from Málaga and he used a very strong accent from there
But yeah somethung like that
Very similar
But yes
But for some reason many don't use it
It's a hard sound to pronounce for some reason, even many British people replace "th" sounds with "f" while speaking English
When I first moved to the UK I didn't know if they were saying " Thursday" or " Fist day"
I think it's cool
An exagerated zorro like puss in boot was the funnier option
I lived in England for a couple of years and I was judged quite often for having an accent even though most people would ask me about where I was from since I don't have a distinctive Spanish accent
I appreciate your feeling but regretfully it is very common
yeh
the "I fink" and the avoiding to pronounce t's (wah uh boh uhl instead of water bottle) drive me nuts
In German there is a word called "Preis-Leistungsverhältnis" which is price-performance discrepancy
I think a lot of people feel like Apple don't deliver enough value for the price they have
Also in my mind 30% of the price is the branding alone
You can't get them easily fixed or it will cost you an arm and a leg, which is another downside
Everything that is being said here can be applied to Spain but, in addition, in recent years I have also noticed that people like to boast about getting a phone that they consider a bargain
For example, I've seen many people brag about their Xiaomi that has specifications very similar to much more expensive phones (iPhones, Samsung)
You can ser more and more people who think it's stupid to spend a lot of money on a phone just for the brand, especially on iPhones, because iTunes has a reputation for being complex and useless
Price difference and variety
IPhones are just one up-to-date model
If you want something chepaer you have to buy an older one
Meanwhile, there are tens of brands with different prize and quality ranges so people can adjust that to their budget and needs
I personally don't want an smartphone as expensive as an iPhone, I'd rather have one in the upper-middle range
Nowadays some brands even release different lines with a wide prize range depending on your interest
For example, some people are more interested in taking photos so you have entire lines of phones where the camera is excellent for its prize range but the processor isn't as good  but that's what some people are looking for
And if you want a top quality state-of-the-art smarthpone like the iPhone, you have different brands to pick with their own specs and design that you might like better
In the US Apple is just that huge because it's an American company and because of really good marketing, but in other parts of the world people acknowledge that there are many brands, and most happen to use Android
So it isn't really a competition between iPhone vs Android but of iPhone vs Samsung vs Sony Xperia vs Xiaomi vs Huawei vs LG vs Google Pixel, etc, etc
with most of those companies having different lines and different prizes
Edit: as other people said, iPhones and their accessories are kinda overpriced too and lack things like dual SIM
Apple products are for posh people
Apple products are just fancy and expensive but in terms of funcionalities offer less and are heavily restricted compared to non-apple producs
I've never payed more than 150€ for a phone and they have been really high quality ones, most of my friends have Chinese brands too, people don't really care about what phone other people use
Except if they use iPhone, I think here it has a bit of bad image
It is a capitalist American symbol, if you use an iPhone here is because you are a posh that only buys products to show off the brand but don't even have the hability to choose a good product (specs)
700€-1000€ is a ridiculous amount of money for a phone here, so if you buy that you're seen a spoilt child that doesn't understand the value of money and only wants to look cool
Most people uses Android and many people changes from Apple to Android
I like android and iphones  are ussualy very fragile
But thats it
Actually, the EU hit very hard Google for abusive dominant position as they were using the os to block non-google apps from competing
I mean, they are the same but Android is just cheaper
Buying an iPhone is only paying for the fashion brand
I agree with this
WhatsApp is so commonly used a standard messaging app, even some commerce and banks communicate with you through them, at least in Spain
Having a cross-system messaging system that is widely used like WhatsApp, Telegram or KakaoTalk, helps the fact that you don't need an iPhone to use iMessage or FaceTime
When I moved to the US, in the Midwest, nobody knew what WhatsApp is, and most people still don't even know it
Yeah, that's 100% true
In Spain we love to buy "good deals", we generally don't care about getting a 1000€ phone, we care about getting a 500€ phone that is almost as good as the 1000€ one and then tell everybody about it hahaha a crazy amount of people is buying Xiomii phones now, some years ago a lot of people was buying OnePlus, etc
I said in another comment but Spain is the second market in volume of Aliexpress, just behind Russia, so
we are in a kind of secret affair with China
I'm a Spaniard too and I'm very happy with my xiaomi and I've had apple phones before but honestly I just prefer to buy a phone with good specs than paying double for something because it has an apple on it
And about iTunes, that system is rubbish and limits you just because they can, I prefer to pay for Spotify than use iTunes for one more day
Buying an iPhone over a comparable yet cheaperAndroid/whatever model is a bad way to handle money
You’re ignoring people who like the iPhone aesthetics or Apple ecosystem
I mean, even if the Chinese gvernment has acces to our data through Chinese companies, so does the American government from Google through Android an all the Google services we use and from Facebook trhough Facebook itself, Instagram, Whatsapp
Very cool, yeah this is also my impression
In the US the government buys the info from the companies, while in China the government might force them  to give them
People were shot dead just to steal the Air Jordans from them
Madrid
Like seriously, (not generalising, some of them) are the personification of the snobism and the greed
This is gonna be controversial, but Madrid
Because of centralism, news often focus on the capital, money flows towards the capital, and some inhabitants there think to be the State à la Louis XIV
It's relatively new compared to some of our Roman and medieval metropolis, its cultural heritage is relatively scarce compared to at least any other in the top 10 most populated and it is at the farthest point of any coast in the country
Some people there have the twisted idea that their city is the most beautiful, that they speak the most perfect Spanish and that there's a reason for it to be the most productive besides its capital status
Those people are wrong, and its embarrassing to see them pointlessly argue
Murcia
They are a different breed over there
Recently it's also joked about for having extremely high support for the party VOX
Honestly, Valencia
It is a love/hate kind of thing
On one hand it has a lot of beautiful places and landmarks, great climate (except heatwaves), rich history and culture plus own language, lots of fun and so on
But at the same time I am truly convinced that it has the highest concentration of dumb twats, crazy far-right hooligans and douchebags per capita in the universe, full of corruption, total lack of decent urban planning (planning in general), underfunded subpar public transportation for its metro area, and trying to go full Barcelona 2
0 in everything that has to do with tourism without learning
(My personal opinion)
In Spain, everyone makes fun of a southern region called Murcia
It’s a small, dry, poor region and locals have a somewhat weird accent that makes them sound dumb
HOWEVER, my family owns a little house there, so I have spent most of my summers in the area, and I have to say that it’s nicer than many people think
It’s got great climate all year round and you get used to its people :)
Also, the capital (also called Murcia, duh) is wildly underrated
It’s full of monuments and history, not to mention its lively summer nights
Anyways, if you reading this ever have the chance of visiting don’t miss out ;)
Madrid
It’s ugly, grey and boring, and the people seem annoyed and unfriendly all the time
Just my perspective though, coming from the south it’s easy to think other people look unfriendly but it could be just how normal people are I guess
Wasn't like 40% of the population from out of France
Honestly, I think Madrid is quite underrated
People living in Madrid are all very friendly and welcome and some old parts of the capital are very well preserved
Also you can find some amazing places to eat tapas and have a beer with friends at a good price
And I'm from Barcelona btw so I'm digging my own grave
I would say that any coast city taken by brits and German youth are the worst, I live relatively close to Salou, Calella and all that jazz and its horrible how dirty and full of underage drunks they are
Wow too much hate here, just because you hear some politicians who talk like this it doesn't mean that madrileños think actually think it
I'm catalan and I met lots of Madrileños while living abroad, they are in general some of the most formidable people I've met
We all know that Madrid is the capital because it's in the middle of the country, no way to deny it, but you must admit that as a result they have the best Spanish museums (in the world's top ten), the best theater life, good restaurants and plenty of sightseeing, just walking around the barrio de las letras is worthy to visit it
And hey, my city was founded by the Romans and I live by the sea but I can still visit Madrid and enjoy it
There are far worse cities in Spain, honestly
I would say that Benidorm or Lloret with their massified turism are a better example
I live in Alcorcón in Madrid, but I wouldn’t say the capitals simply because of our fútbol :( We need Real and Atletico
As well many of our businesses are centered there so it’s kind of very important
But our Spanish is
much slang
Slides on the tongue more jeje
I prefer cuidadonos, or PP though
No, that's just bonus material for jokes
I don't actually have a dislike for Murcia or Murcianos but it's clear from all the memes that it's like the odd one out in Spain
Same happened with me in Lisboa
I love Portugal but is really dirty
Oh so that’s where mermaids are from
We don't need them bc your not expected to be EXACTLY at the time, you'll have like a ten minutes margin
"Taba ocupao follandome a tu madre"
"I was busy fucking your mother"
I say it when talking with very close friends
"There was a traffic jam" if you go by car
Or "I came across someone who speaks to much".
In Spain we don't need an excuse to be late, we just are
It was impossible to park, but most of the time it's true, so
Same in Spain
We truly are brothers
Same in Madrid but with the subway (I don't know in the rest of Spain)
Although it is something my mother would say in the 90s, it is no longer very common
Nice one, love your cycling culture
If I say that to my boss in Spain he might think I'm on drugs or something
I used to take the green line everyday, I didn't even need a excuse to be late
A  perk of living near the slowest underground line in the city
Imagine going up to your boss and saying that lmao
Walloon is a language native to Wallonia (and parts of Northern France) separate from French
But afaik it's basically gone because due to the cultural influence of France after the French Revolution, French was imposed in schools and it's nowadays what Wallons speak
If we can call something a Belgian language, it would be Walloon
I would say Spain is the guy that arrives one and a half hours late, has breakfast in the cafeteria while Italy is preparing the pasta for lunch
They have a nice little chat and Spain goes to their office
Nobody knows how Spain got an office while most other guys on their floor are in desks (except for management aka
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium)
So Spain starts answering emails from the week before but before he can start working proper, the computer fails
Headed down to I.T., Spain realises they have no idea who's in charge: "excuse me". A number of vodka bottles are promptly hidden in drawers as the slavic men stare Spain
"My computer's stuck at the home screen". They all start speaking in an incomprehensible language and finally Romania stands up: "let's have a look".
Back at the office, Spain is explaining the problem in detail but Romania is not listening
He slaps the front of the computer and the screen unfreezes
As Romania leaves the room, he hears: "Oh, well
Thank you" and turns around, surprised
Spain doesn't know this, but Romania can count with the fingers of a hand how many times he's been thanked for his work
So he invites Spain over for vodka next time he's by I.T. "Nice" thinks Spain
By this point Sweden has completed the days work and most people are having lunch
Spain starts working
He sees Germany fly past his door to go scream Italy for spending too much on garlic, probably
Nevermind Germany, why is the desk so cluttered
"I really have to sort out this real estate, it's a chaos" he thinks to himself
As Greece walks down the hall she throws a faint smile into his office
Despite her tired look, it warms his heart
"Poor girl, Greece" Spain thinks
"She really deserves better".
A while later, Spain is on his way to the cafeteria for lunch
He is the only one eating so late, but it's usually a good chance to catch up with Italy
Being pals with the cook is always nice, as you can get your food warmed up no matter how late
Spain sees Finland and Sweden on their way to the parking
Lucky souls
, getting home so early, but he knows he couldn't bring himself to wake up at 5 a.m. to mimick their schedule
Spain isn't sure if she should say goodbye
Have they seen her
Sweden is pointedly looking at the door
Oh, too late
"Hey Italy, what's the deal
" Italy looks pale and her eyes are red
"Have you been crying
" "Oh, Spain, it's terrible
Germany is threatening to fire me
" "Italy, why the fuck is that
Did you tell France about it
". As the conversation escalated, their hands jumped faster and faster in the air, as if conducting an invisible orchestra
"Oh, yes, France says if Germany fires me she'll bring out the guillotine, but then they both agreed that I can't come back to work for at least a month" Spain was getting more and more confused
"Oh, I forgot to explain" realised Italy
"Apparently I have a virus" "A virus
" "Yeah, but I'm fine
I probably caught it from China last week
She's been stuck at home, but I don't feel sick at all, and at worst it's gonna be a silly flu". "Well, I get that Germany would be worried about the food
" "Do you think I'm fucking stupid
" abrupted Italy
"I've been cooking with a face mask and gloves
There's nothing to worry about". "Oh in that case there's probably nothing to worry about" Spain admitted
"I guess I'll have some, then" he laughed
Italy laughed along as  he served the pasta
It was nice getting to laugh with a friend after such a stressful day
"Italy" said Spain after finishing his meal
"You'd be getting paid leave anyways, right
" Italy nodded
"You should take it then
We won't be eating so well, but you'll get to rest and recover sooner
" Italy stared through the window for a long moment
"I'll think about it, amico". They smiled and Spain got back to his office
He had a lot of work to do
"I'm telling you, Germany" said Netherlands angrily while waving a long sheet of paper on his boss' face
"Our finances are tight and perfectly calculated
We can't start giving away free money for our employees **not to come to work**". "Netherlands, I'm telling you to calm down". As he turned the corner, Spain saw the two figures in heated discussion
Rather, he saw the calm but annoyed silhouette of Germany standing the hot rage of the Netherlands
Netherlands saw him too
"Oh, look at him, boss
He's just now finished his lunch
Surely getting ready for a well deserved siesta to rack up his working hours
". "Netherlands, that's not how we talk to each other in this company". But Spain was all out of patience for the day: "How nice and professional, talking shit behind Italy's back
Like you didn't get a month paid leave last time your house flooded
". Netherlands looked at Spain with poison in his eyes, but he kept talking: "Oh, and the one before that
My god, how many floods is this company gonna pay you for
" "Shut your mouth, you Catholic monkey
". Germany gave a him a look of disapproval
"Make me, you whiny protestant bitch". "Spain
" Germany said in a desperate attempt to keep the appearance of discipline
"Please, go back to work". Spain and Netherlands shared a last look of hatred and everyone went their bitter ways
The sun was setting down and Spain had almost finished
Maybe today she would even have time left to check her email and leave everything ready for tomorrow
France opened the door: "I assume you didn't even think of staying away from Italy". Spain bounced in his chair out of surprise: "What
". "Right
I'm getting you tested
Tomorrow you'll go to Canada's clinic before coming here, and if you test positive you'll be on sick leave
" "But France, you can't start getting people out of work like this
The company will come to a hault
" "It's for everyone's safety, Spain
I'm here to protect the workers, and the workers are at risk". "But why
, it's just a flu". "A FLU
A flu wouldn't put China on the ICU
A flu wouldn't have left her breathing through a tube
This is serious". France was shaking
Spain looked down: "Oh
I understand
I'm sorry
" "It's not your fault, mon ami
I'm sorry too, this situation is overwhelming, but I shouldn't have screamed
Panic only makes things worse". "No offense, then
Thank you for letting me know". France smiled, but Spain's faced looked somber: "One more thing, France" "Oui
" "Will we really be getting support from the company if we can't come work
I overheard Germany and the NetherDamn before
They didn't seem eager
" France looked uncomfortable: "to be honest
I don't know
But I will do what I can". "It's alright, France
Health first
We will fight the money fight when this is over".
France left with the dying dusk and the yellow light of the streetlamps filled the office with shadows
Spain sighed and turned off the computer
As always, he wasn't able to do everything
Looking on the bright side, all that was important was finished
Most of it good work
"How long until he'd be at this office again
" He gathered his things and locked the door, heading for the street
When he left the building he looked to the side
Sitting against the wall was Syria, with a cardboard box containing several coins and an old mark bill
Spain knew Syria from years ago, when he worked at a company nearby
He had heard the rumors: in fighting, foreign investment, a takeover and finally a tragic explosion
He didn't know much of the deal, but it was undoubtedly a sad story
He took out his wallet and put a 2€ coin in his only hand
It would have felt weird to give a bill to a beggar
Syria smiled briefly, but quickly looked away
"If only I could do more" Spain thought
As he walked away, he heard a faint, dry sound
Probably a pigeon's wings flapping, or a window closing somewhere
Hopefully not a cough
"Please, let it be anything but that".
We work in the cafeteria
Or we're just unemployed
Travel agent maybe
Spain [hasn’t showed up to the office in years and is still collecting a paycheck]
We are the cubicle where you go when you are tired from work and want to talk with the guy who is there, but even though that guy is fucked up in that cubicle he will try to make a nice time for you
HR because we're sociable and stuff
But it'd backfire and in reality we'd spend most of the time at the bar just around the corner of the office building having a coffee or a beer with our work colleagues
The one that doesn't know what is doing here but is happy to be, probably
Spain is that one guy who doesn't take anything seriously and shows up late everyday
Job you say
The marketing guy
He gets close to everyone, sometimes too close
Underpaid intern that somehow remains in the company despite having to search the internet to solve the problems because he/she is utterly useless
Arrives always late, annoys co-workers by being extremely loud and can't even get along with people in his department
Tries to hide it by dressing cool and seducing ~~european tourists and expats and Germany's leadership~~ the boss
The guy/girl that makes coffees
I want to say events planner, like preparing the company parties and everything (not really efficient but fun nevertheless)
You can be my +1 to the office Christmas party
Australians are always good to have around
pop down to the bottle o and grab us a slab of mangoes, will ya
XXXX Gold- the Milton mango
(My girlfriend is from Brisbane so I’ve spent quite a bit of time in QLD)
I’ll never turn away a cold VB
Yes
And my accent is completely fucked lol
I have a mixture of my own Spanish accent, the British standard and whatever is the norm in American media (Californian
New Yorker
I'm not consistent with pronunciation nor with spelling nor with vocabulary
I did learn British English so that's what I try to speak and write
But since I left formal educaction I just go with whatever comes to my mind, although I recognise that I shouldn't do it
I used to be more consistent when I watched more British shows but now that I think about it, all the shows I watch in English nowadays are American
Holy sh\*\* yes, as someone studying translation its a pain in the ass
Yes, and since I work with both Brits and Americans I just don't know which spelling to use or if I'm using the 'wrong' words
I figure I sound like those English speakers that learn a type of South American Spanish and come to Spain lol
My accent is basically American though
Absolutely, and because of the main media I consume is American, when I try to speak English, I try to do an American accent because it's what I am more used to
The importance they place on race
Seven years ago, my gf and I went to visit friends in Florida and had a very creepy experience at the airport in NY
I'm very white skinned and light haired and my gf is more tanned and dark haired, more Mediterranean
We both put white race on the forms you have to fill in before entering the country and they accused us of lying because she was Latina
For us that was a sock, in Spain, Latino is used for a person whose country of origin is Latin American, not a race
They also insisted that it could be a crime for having lied on a form, and that race was something very important for health insurance (????? fcking creepy)
Anyway, we were pretty scared but we managed to sort it out and we were reconciled with our Roman Latino blood
There were many other things that surprised us, the one I found most annoying was having to pay tips everywhere and having to calculate tips all time
On the other hand, as others have said, you get so much food in one order that we were able to share a plate almost everywhere and save a few dollars (although the staff gave us the stink eye
Addressing adults by their first name is quite common in Spain
Here in Spain we do walk with shoes within house
People wear shoes inside their homes
So strange
Everyone on reddit seems to think that wearing shoes inside your house is weird, but me, my whole family, and almost everyone I have met in person wears them inside their house
I was in Dublin a couple of years ago for the first time in 10 years and I was surprised about the number of homeless people I saw
Did the problem get much worse between 2008 and 2018
[Cross post from /r/es/ \(Spain\)]
The US incarceration rate is the highest in the world
If I were you, I wouldn't be denying the issue with anecdotal experience
I would be [worried]
Yeah, frickish central europeans
and British
and scandinavian
and
i'm seeing a pattern here
Do you really call female teachers pana
I don't mean getting on the couch or bed with shoes, I mean just wearing them inside the house
I loved the massive American portions, I wish they were more common here
I just love junk food (having it once in a while, that is)
Ok, thanks
It sounded weird because in latinoamerican spanish, it would be the same as calling your teacher bro or homie
Partiendo la pana mi pana
The king announced that he would retire the former king (his still alive father) from the list of members who recieve public money because of the existing scandal around money washing and corruption he was involved
He also renounced to the heritage
Sadly it appeared only 1 or 2 days in the news and can´t be put on court as probably most of us would like until the pandemic is over
And it is not clear if the current king knew about it since long ago and only decided to act like this now that it kind of got discovered or if the really wasnt profiting from the corruption at all
There are some news about the former king being corrupt but, actually that's usual with our politics here in Spain, so even if this situation hasn't drawn the attention, nothing would have happened
Fascists and former government party are asking for a military coup, if that counts
I don't know, and that's the problem
They only cover Covid 19 in the news
It's not an exaggeration, there's only one daily new that's not about the virus
Bad stuff is certainly happening because bad stuff always happens, but it's just not getting covered
The government just paid 100 million € to the Big media companies to wash their image and make false statistics
There is a virus that is killing people and that draws attention to everybody, at the same time Whatsapp is being censored by a far-left newspaper (Newtral) and TV is being controlled by the leftists as well
It's a shame seeing how they're getting in control of the media and even social networks while we can't do anything to prevent it, in 20 years we'll be Venezuela
But is that bad thing or is it just something that was innevitable
Alitalia has been borrowing public money for years now, and I dont think they would ever been able to return it, so rather than just throwing money at them maybe nationalised it can at least go even (although well, with the current stand fly companies are not really good in terms of future growths
yep, the guy basically stole 100 million euros and gave it to their son in inheritance, the current king
The King didn't say or act at all during the first outbreak of COVID-19 and only appeared 10 mins on TV with a shitty speech trying to get everyone to fight the pandemic while he seats in his palace paid by everyone's taxes
Then, lowkey he gave the 100 million to his daughter (the heiress) and said he "refused" his father's inheritance but hey, you also inherited the crown, you know what I mean, you cannot refuse an inheritance by parts
Do polls predict that he's going to lose or smth
I honestly think this is not reason to be worried yet
They are just starting the mud machine, which will run continously for the next 4 years or until they win an election
Hopefully the far right doesn't have so much support and most people here really reject violence because of the past horrors
All in all, our democracy is probably not in danger, but we must be ready to defend it and fight their lies and hate
Is this a lie as well
I don't want to believe it, I don't want to believe that Spain has already crossed the line and there's no way back, that I will have to migrate to another country before this one gets destroyed, but it's obvious that the cycle has started
Enjoy it
Our center-right Party (2nd biggest) is called PP
Wouldn't be surprised if by the end of the year Napoleon came back from the dead and restored the French Empire
Probably not the craziest thing that could happen this year
So Newtral is only censoring Facebook, we must accept that, if it's only facebook is not a big deal, right
Newtral creates hoaxes and fake news that benefit the left
The 5 main TV channels (TVE, Telecinco, Antena3, LaSexta and Cuatro) are awfully left-winged
But it's obvious that leftists like the one posting above you are very happy to have those so they can control the population
And remember, being the worst country in the world regarding Coronavirus handling is not the government fault, being one of the worst countries handling 2008 crisis is not government fault (it was leftist at the time), only bad luck, always bad luck and hoaxes everywhere xDDDDD
You should've said "Thanks for the explanation, now my country will accept coronabonds so your country can give free money to everybody"
Antena3 awfully left winged lmao
None of them are leftwinged, maybe TVE and LaSexta a little bit socialdemocrat
Come back to the 50's, fascist
hahahaha "none of them are leftwinged,. Maybe Lasexta and TVE" he says
Telecinco with 6 hours every single day of Salvame shitting on everything and everyone with right ideology is neutral xDDDDDDDD Where is the hidden camera bro
Is this a prank
Jorge Javier Vázquez, vanguard of the worker class, the spanish Lenin
You guys live in a parallel world
Hahaha now Jorge Javier is not a leftist, what else
For men: Casimiro, Bonifacio, Severino, Eustaquio, Anastasio
For women: Gregoria, Tomasa, Rufina
Leovigildo (M) and Baldomera (F)
Spain
Telesforo, Nemesio, Agapito, Saturnino, Anselmo
for male
Hermenegilda, Gertrudis, Eustaquia, Fulgencia for female
Male: Espiridión, Wenceslao, Hipólito, Macario
Female: Auxilio, Socorro, Urraca, Reparada
In Spain I think that would be Hermenegildo
Rogelia, Umberto, Athanasio, Lazaro, Theodora, Bonifacia
just from looking at the oldest members of my family tree from the 17th and 18th century
I would've gone with Hermenegildo
[Here's a myriad of them
Angustias (Sorrows), Brígida, Esperanza (Hope), Bienvenida (Welcome)
Yes
In Spain, WELCOME (The Spanish translation) is an actual name
Any visigothic sounding name really
Que no falte Hermenegildo
>Spain
Horacio and Genaro as well
The future queen of Spain is called Leonor
I know some people called Ludmilla that are from South America, It's more common there than in Spain
De los nombres que he mencionado únicamente conozco a un Bonifacio, que era profesor mío de la universidad, de más de 70 años
Yes, Casimiro would be the Spanish version of it
However the literal translation is "almost" (casi) and "see" (miro, mirar)
So it's ironic when a blind person is called Casimiro
Same
super popular here too
Yes, Alfonso is a spanish name
Yes
idk
The famous one here is Urraca de Zamora (and had no sister called Raimunda), but it was a common name during the middle age between the nobility, there were a lot of queens, infantas, etc
called Urraca
In Spain double names are very normal (with a few exceptions such as Borja María), but TRIPLE names are seen as very burgeois
Balenciaga was a tailor from a town like 30 minutes from me
He was a "basque" I put that in quotes because it's a sensitive topic in Spain
I agree with it, definitely, although it should have been done earlier
I also have to say that as someone who comes from an area that largely depends on coal mining (and that's already very heavily in decline since like 40 years ago), I hope they try to maybe fund some industry here so the area doesn't die
Otherwise, of the about 100
000 people currently living around here, I don't think half will remain in 30 years time
Yes, I lived in the UK for a few years and then I came back to Spain
I have a English teaching business therefore I may spend most days speaking English, whence someone speaks to me in Spanish or catalan it may take me a few moments to realise and "change" it
Yes, once I was working and one of the customers realized I speak Spanish and start talking in Spanish without previous warning and my brain was so confused for seconds he apologized as he thought I didn't speak Spanish at all
Also when I listen to [people from Gibralta] or Latin-American people living in the USA speaking half Spanish half English I can't get much of what they are saying even when they are using words I know in both languages
Yes,  sometimes
It also happens to me with spanish/galician
Even sometimes i dont know if the last sentece i said it in spanish or galician
Interesting, to me it sounds like a dutch trying to speak russian but he's having a stroke
Spain is currently the country with the biggest number of biosphere reserves
Our timezone should be UTC, but we use CET/CEST because Francisco Franco changed it back in 1942 to be in the same timezone as Italy, Germany
and we haven't changed it
Our anthem is the third oldest in the world and one of the few without official lyrics
The Quijote, by Cervantes, is often considered as one of the most important novels throughout history (and ofc, it's written by a spaniard)
We are the country with the largest organ donation, contributing with 20% of organ donations in the EU and 6% in the whole world
PS: Sorry if there are some minor gramatical errors
My English is not the best out there
The say "the Sun never sets on the British empire" used to be ours "the Sun never sets on the spanish empire". It was coined because at one point we had territories in all 5 continents, Including a firm grip over Europe with much of Southern italy, the duchy of milan, much of the netherlands, parts of western and Southern France, belgium and malta having been under spanish rule
Spain was a important part of the roman empire
We have many ruins along our territory, including one of the few complete roman city walls (Lugo)
In fact we're part of that legacy, much of our current population is descendent of the native celts (and iberians) and the roman conquerors, with little posterior addmixture
Spain is extremely mountainous
We have rugged terrain in the north south and center, that means that even with 40°C summers in the Major cities we have snow all year long on some mountains
By the way our Highest peak is actually on the canary island off the coast of Africa mt Teide (4300m)
Spain is home to one of the most important archaelogical sites in Europe, Altamira
This site was the first place where cave paintings we're found, then unheard of, and is to this day one of the best examples of cave art
the french expert kept denying their veracity until they found cave paintings of their own
We are a land of writers
Everybody knows about Miguel de Cervantes but we have many authors: Francisco de Quevedo, Lorca, Lope de Vega, becqer, Unamuno, Machado, Delibes, Juan Ramón Jiménez
And many more
After all we have 6 literary Nobel
out of our 8 Nobel
- Spain is the oldest Spanish country in Europe
- Spain has the biggest biodiversity within Spanish territory
- No other single country in Europe has as many Spanish speakers that can also speak Euskera
- Spain has the biggest beach in the world that is located in Spain
-Spanish people will try a stick on you to find out if it results in new invention
...apnd so many others
I'm sure the coffee thing is to fight those long hours of darkness
The Quixote is considered the first modern novel too
I was about to write a list just for your number 5 but you added it first ;-)
I'd add:
Spain is the 3rd country with more UNESCO declared world heritage sites
The world's oldest restaurant is located in Madrid, Restaurante Botín.
Andorra shares 2 head of state (Co princes), 1 from Spain (the Urgell Bishop) and 1 from France (the president of France)
We were the 3rd country legalising same sex marriage
Spain played an important part in USA independence from the British Empire providing
supplies and munitions as well as financial support
And apparently we invented the submarine, the astronaut suit, the mop, the lollipop and other kind of stuff putting togheter a stick+something
Actual en inglés no es "actual" sino "current". Es un falso amigo
La palabra actual en inglés significa algo así como "real" o "verdadero" (por ejemplo la expresión "actually" que significa "de hecho" o "en realidad")
Se usa para enfatizar
Dude, I remember how the Spanish sports media went crazy with that octopus
It became our unofficial hero of that World Cup
Agreed
Those are also very interesting
>The Quixote is considered the first modern novel too
By some, but many others consider Genji Monogatari (Japanese novel writen in the XI century) the first modern novel
To be fair I was expecting a rickroll (this is much better than what I was expecting)
Edit: how do you put your country's flag in your username
Genji Monogatari is considered the first novel, not the first MODERN novel
Let me translate what you say: I have no idea about literature
[Here] a link with a response from a fellow redditer
Some people believe sex education courses at schools teach kids as young as 6 how to masturbate and our government is communist
The communist government thing has become a meme tho
Wait
what
In Spain the new goverment wants to legalize euthanasia and is pro abortion, the rigth wing is saying they want to kill new borns and elders to save money on sanity
Healthcare, not sanity
There is little of the last one left among our government and politicians
>euthanasia for the depressed
Spain rate drops to 0%
"You know, the other day was walking through Sevilla and I found a Marta, told her, “Damn, for how long that we not see each other
" and she waved back
Talked for a while until that her rang the phone
Before going told her that had the shoe untied, that if  not was to fall
Ever since not her have seen more
And you
This hurts
The other day was I to walk with my dog and plus my sister through beach when found us with a jellyfish
Despite that was good death, a mine little she-dog started bark like it us was to attack
(From Galicia, don't know if it would be too different)
A idea demential
We go to butcher the English and no I regret of participate
Make cold today here, I go put me one jacket, and after I go cook macaroni for the hour of the food because I have hunger
This afternoon I go to go to work and no it appeal me nothing
Greetings of Spain
No understand how is possible that take the pie of the oven fresh in turn of hot or at least warm
Heat the things in the fridge
Seems Japangrish hehehe
Too have a friend called Marta
Met her in the high school there for the 2013
Long time no speak with her, but am sure that if to meet, would like a reunion between old friends
Last night, i and my Friends went to a restaurant very fancy
Not half bad
Suppose that It seems a lot, but here goes the version spanish
Uff what say, well, yesterday made strudel and zabaione, the strudel was great and the zabaione was curious
The problem IS that i not know if get out well, because never that have tasted
Some clue
By truth, yesterday find out of that lagrange was italian
Not have none idea
The part of wanker mine me has intrigued
pop down to the bottle-o and grab us a slab of tinnies mate, cheers
¿Have the same rigidity in the order of the words the Norwegian that the English
That funny, could do other thread about the order of the words that uses Yoda in each language
In certain way
We say "le dije" that is difficult of translate, because "le" is a pronoun complex
It use  to substitute the complement indirect and it puts beforethe (yes, goes together) verb
Further not has gender, so that It could put as "her/him/It told" or even "you told"
All the It are "lo", another strange pronoun, except the last one which is "se" the strangest "pronoun" (It can even be a part of verbs, it's complicated)
Pretty sure they do it in Catalan as well
Think that in reality is in Spanish the unique idiom of the bunch in the that is done
Fuck, to write this me provokes ache of head
fuckin' oath cunt, i'll bring the bevvies and we'll take your tinnie out for the arvo
(my ex gf was aussie so I *might* have picked up a bit of the local lingo)
That must be great
Here reigns the chaos
By true, live in new zealanad or be in travel
Too it we do in Galician
Well, always have though that for example in English, that no it had counted as part of the bunch Romance, "another" is in truth "one other", so too
Me feels Japanese now for some motive hehe
Three years
Fuck and in new zealand
Has to be great
some reason in special to go to study to the other point of the globe
In plain English: to some extent but not as much as you may think
Both have plenty of particular gramatical figures
Sorry, I am too lazy for that and I don't have a backgroung on languages
But I am a Galician native and I also lived in Portugal for swveral years
I give you one, duality on "te" and "che" pronouns in Galician
Pronouns, pronomes pessoais
Yes, I would like that
There are more than a few reasons to support a boycott (starting with how Qatar was selected to host the World Cup)
I do not think it will happen, though :(
Impossible
Those mfs have so many relations with Qatar
Yes, i agree
An example is how two American soldiers that killed two Spanish journalists in Iraq have been protected by the US and there is no way we can bring them to justice before the Spanish court
The US is just a bully, and I say that despite living in the country
I’m sure you were really sad about that honey producers
Rajoy once said "España es una gran nación. Y los españoles muy españoles y muchos españoles" which in English would be
"Spain is a great Nation
And the Spaniards very Spaniards and a lot of Spaniards"
"the Spaniards very Spaniards and a lot Spaniards" Mariano Rajoy, former president
He has a lot more like this
"Esto no es como el agua que cae del cielo sin que se sepa exactamente por qué..."
"This is not like the water that drops from the sky (rain) that drops and nobody know exactly why" Mariano Rajoy, it was the  Prime minister when he said nobody knows why rain happens or what causes it
In 1981 a former ministry of health said: "the illness is caused by a tiny bug
It's so small that if it falls from the table it dies". He said this about a sanitary crisis with rapeseed oil when the government still didn't know about what caused the sickness
Uuuuh, Mariono Rajoy (former president with clear speaking problems)  said many nonsense things
Like "Spain is a great nation, and the spanish very spanish a lot spanish" (literal translation, it didn't make sense in spanish either)
Or "we have to build robots because what robots will never do is build more robots". A good one I love is "Long live wine
Mariano Rajoy
"Spain is a great nation, and the Spaniards very Spaniards and much Spaniards"
"75 million Spaniards come to Spain each year"
"ETA (the basque terrorist group) is a great nation"
"Catalans are entrepeneurs, they make things"
"A glass is a glass and a dish is a dish"
"Is the neighbor who chooses the mayor and is the mayor who wants the neighbor to be the mayor"
And many more
Mariano Rajoy was Spain's president
We are in the Champions League of the economy - Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, 2007
Our former president Mariano Rajoy was a factory of nonsense and stupid phrases
His page in Wikiquote is a goldmine :  [
But my favourite came from Ana Botella as Mayor of Madrid in 2013 and her infamous speech for the Olympic 2020 bid in front of the International Olympics Commitee
Her english was pretty rudimentary but everyone here remembers the quote:
>"[There's nothing quite like a relaxing cup of *café con leche* in *plaza mayor*?]
Another big one came from Esperanza Aguirre when she was running for Mayor of Madrid in 2015 [on twitter] "*In Madrid everything that is not prohibited will be allowed
I like the Catalans because they *do things*
This [a political problem] is not like the water that falls down from the sky without anybody knowing how
Both by out beloved Mariano Rajoy Brey
Son los vecinos los que eligen al alcalde y es el alcalde el que quiere que sean los vecinos el alcalde
"It's the neighbors who choose the major and it's the major who wants the neighbors to be the major"
Tenemos que fabricar máquinas que nos permitan seguir fabricando máquinas porque lo qie nunca va a hacer una máquina es fabricar máquinas
"We have to create machines to allow us to keep creating machines because what machines are never going to do is create machines"
Lo que hemos hecho es engañar a la gente
(to the leader of a socialist-socdem-eurocom coalition party) "What we have done is lying to the people
¡Viva el vino
(holding milk) "Long live wine
ETA es una gran nación. Perdón, España es una gran nación.
"ETA is a great nation
Sorry, Spain is a great nation
España es una gran nación, y los españoles muy españoles y mucho español
"Spain is a great nation, and the Spaniards very Spaniards and a lot of Spaniards"
-Mariano Rajoy Brey, a true enlightened thinker
Wow
So drunk pedestrians deserve to fucking die for the henious crime of walking home when drunk instead of driving
Any famous Rajoy sentence is a good answer to the post, really
Classics like "a dish is a dish and a glass is a glass" or "what we have come here to do, which is what you don't do yourself is
lying to the people".
When he was alleging that Catalans would lose their Spanish citizenship if they went independent in an interview, and the interviewer cut him off to tell him that was not the case
and he muttered: "What about European citizenship
" (¿Y la Europea
you could just see the clueless guy behind the transparent façade
Abascal said yesterday that the left has historically hated homosexuals and denied them rights
I'm not even surprised anymore
This didn't age well
Rajoy best boy
Rajoy had Trump levels of stupid phrases
Oh that moment was top Rajoy
Tbh I don't watch politics nor care about them
That I am aware
Yeah this are among my favorites but are quite hard to translate, hahah
I do miss having fun and whatnot, but he was a very bad president even if you ignore his possible corruption
So unaccountable
0 fucks given
On the second one he was trying to accuse another party of lying
For the life of me I can't say about the first one
I think in the first one he was trying to say "it is what it is" when talking about international and EU treaties about the self-determination right or lack thereof of Catalonia
He's just a sad fool who thinks that Spain right now is shit (which I can't deny, even if I support this new government) and that he is the only one that can fix this fuckup
He's also Trump's n°1 fan and his personal cocksucker, if you ask me
He could host a TV show
A united country and Spaniards treating each other like brothers
Don't worry, it's not happening
Gran Vía (the largest avenue in Madrid) is literally EMPTY
Here's a livecam, it's eerie:  [
Everything was unthinkable
Nobody drinking in the streets at 3:00 am
Worst time to be alive for sure
I don't care about the illness itself, I care about the million jobs that will disappear
People won't have what to eat
the unemployment rate will grow like never before
So many families will be shattered because of this
What hurts the most is knowing our governments had 1 month of advantage and they did not do anything
They did this to us
And then they speak wonderful things about the European Union
well, you condemned us to a shit life after this
I wish all Europe would have closed its borders when the first cases appeared, just like Russia did
Now they are just fine
Don't Germans work some of the least hours per capita though
Which is a good thing, on the opposite of the spectrum from eastern Asia who work themselves to death
Same here
Day 2 it's ending and I am already going nuts
My depression and anxiety are so high I've been sick all day
I can't imagine existing like this for, at least, a month
I don't think I'd be able to handle this quarantine
I think southern Europeans are behaving much better this time than those from the north
Maybe we are not that lazy and incompetent after all, and there are some prejudices against us
Kurde
Yes but now you can investigate the virus and learn a lot
Every day thousands of microbiologists and other professionals are researching treatments
Not all that, you can try to control the flow of people that gets infected, mostly so healthcare doesn't collapse so quickly
Talking from my perspective, Spanish government has failed
They reacted too slowly
Until Sunday they didn't order quarantine
Both president and vice-president wife's have coronavirus and they (president and vice-president) are not even on quarantine
Tourists are walking Madrid streets even if there are almost 6000 cases
No one gives a fuck honestly
I don't know how we let it get this far, honestly
we had the signs, we had China's example and methods
and yet we fucked it up
I am sorry, right now the picture is totally black for me
Thank you really much
Psychologically I am having a hard time
I know 15 days is not much, but we all know it's gonna last much more than that
That's why I am so afraid and anxious, because I don't see any horizon
Our life has stopped in every aspect, not just social, but academic, professional, with our own family members
I am afraid of how long will it last, and the consequences all this will have
Probably, almost all my family members are going to lose their jobs
I am graduating this year (let's see if coronavirus allows it) I was so excited because I saw that they were many opportunities available, so many things I had the chance to do
But now
It's all over
I'd be lucky if I am able to find a job
And that, to millions and millions of people
I am sorry if I am so negative but I am having a hard time
That you for your support, I really hope this all ends soon
We have to be united brothers, all of us
No matter where you are, this is the first time humanity has to work together to make it, for real
Here in Spain everybody thinks that Spain's different and we do nothing good and so on
But this time I think we are behaving more or less (with some exceptions, but watching Swiss, German and Dutch people acting the same way makes me think we are not that incompetent after all)
Hey Spanish here too, some of my friends are having a hard time with this too
We kinda sorted some ways for them to feel less anxious
We do group calls every day for some hours
Everyone does their things during the call but we feel more in company chatting while cooking or playing videogames (even if we don't play the same)
It's not much but it has worked for us all
Also, you will graduate this year for sure, this won't last for the rest of the year
I know it's a complex situation but it'll be over soon
As we are in similar situations feel free to DM if you need to talk about anything
We should had closed our borders when the first cases appeared
Even if it had economic consequences they would have never been what we are going to have now
Everyone ignored it
The first cases appeared back in January and they decided to ignore it, same in almost every European country
I honestly don't understand why they did not do that
I wonder if they really thought the virus would go away by itself without tracking other possible cases
Governments have done nothing right to control the coronavirus from expanding
We will be just like Italy
And then France will be the same as us, then Germany
then UK
we all gonna fall
Thank you
I know it's the best for us all but I am struggling
Today I felt better
I guess we'll get used to it
What made my day was how everyone in my barrio started clapping at 8 pm
I felt how we are all together in this, struggling
Everyone from nurses and doctors to workers and us, here and everywhere in the world
I know it may be silly but it made me feel nice
Thank you so much for your advice, I'll try it
I don't really have the habit of making videocalls at all, I'll have to try it
Yeah the clapping also happened at 8 pm here in my neighbourhood
My sister works all day in a pharmacy and she really appreciates the support from everyone
I didn't like videocalls either but it's making the long days easier
Glad I can help
Blame game
I am blaming Spanish government, I have that right since it concerns me
It's not 1918
Your argument it's kind of invalid since we have a lot more of resources now
Back in 1918 medicine was not as developed as now
we know a lot more things now that back then, that's s fact
Nope
I think Iceland is probably the country with the highest coolness per capita, if we exclude some micro states
New Zealand probably ranks higher in total coolness though
I always remember Iceland because of a dude named JOISPOI24
I wish I could say I don’t but sometimes I look at a map or hear a fun fact and I’m like “oh
Right
It still exists
” Only to forget about it 3 seconds after
would love to visit though
Sounds nice but **I'd much rather**  have them improve the already existing railines in the west i.e. making  them cheap enough to compete with the absurdly low airplane fares
I am not sure how the demand would be for High-Speed trains in Eastern Europe, as well as the orography of Greece and neighboring countries is the least welcoming one for trains and even less high-speed trains since the maximum curvature of a track is greatly reduced compared to standard trains
For that reason, I'm out
Afaik the construction of a line connecting Lisbon to Madrid and from there to the European network is in process
At least in Spain they're doing it assuming your government will eventually build their side and connect the line in Badajoz
On the bright side, we are building the line up until the border so if at some point you get funds to do so it wouldn't take too long to be connected to the rest of Europe through Barcelona or Bilbao
Depends of the question
But I think I search more for other countries comments, just because a lot of times there isn't an answer from a Spanish, but that's because Reddit is niche here
Edit: corrected a small spelling mistake
I always scroll down to see what those bastards say :)
Most of the time I can't find answers regarding spain so i just scroll normally
I try to be active, but either I don’t know how to answer, or more commonly, I’m not on reddit when a question is asked (I browse my homepage, not each individual sub, so I miss a lot)
Straight up, I'm just curious to see who else in Spain is in Reddit too
Yeah it's true, here in Spain is mostly UNICEF ads
I can't talk for all european countries because I've only lived in Spain and Germany, but yeah, they're very common
Yes i see them, whats the problem
When i was still lesrning english and i heard the N-word I thought it was just a fancy word for black
In no way offensive (since it is similar to the word negro in spanish)
So when I wrote it in a writing homework our american teacher had given us he almost choked, thinking i was some sort of neo nazi
I remember being auto-banned for saying "negro" while talking spanish in an online game
It just means black, as in the color, so i was really wierded out
Imagine getting autobanned for saying "green" in a foreign server lol
**Parachute** because it is identical to the French word and a calque of the Spanish Paracaídas (literally "Falls stopper")
Also my immature high school companions immediately pointed that Parachute can also be read in Spanish as: "for a drug-induced high".
I'm cackling right now
I can imagine your poor innocent family lol
In spanish you can either say Té o Infusión for tea
And Im not 100% sure abut this but technically I think Infusión is any beverage prepared with warm water and herbs, and té is an specific kind of infusión.
¿Chino en portugués es chinés, no
¿Por qué pensabas que era una palabra ofensiva en español
Por curiosidad :)
A funny second meaning of the word is a small stone or piece of gravel
So as a child it was forbidden to throw stones but sometimes you'd get permission to play/throw small chinos or chinitos (also chinitas)
It’s descriptive at least ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
I believe wardrobe comes from Spanish "guardarropa", literally clothesstore, although the pronunciation is markedly uglier IMO
Furniture is actually one of the few words that made me laugh ot loud in English class, it looks like an ancient curse and is pronounced like you're having a stroke
No yeah and i used the hard r and all
I might start learning Danish the, german isn't cutting it for me even with the latin tie
Aleluya in spanish
Wiener, delicatessen, hamster, wanderlust, zeitgeist
In a few parts of South America due to Native American influence, 'chino' refers to someone small, like a child
Or the traditional/formal meaning of a Chinese
Same in Spanish
I've only ever heard wop in mafia themed media
also we translate it into spaghetti
Ah yes, Spain, that famous region of Mexico/s
Spanjool is bad
It sounds like the correct pronunciation of the spanish version of español which is how we call ourselves when we speak in spanish
About the word Spaniard, I didnt know about that until I emigrated to USA and found out that the biggest forum of spanish expats is spaniards
So know, here in the US I describe myself as spaniard cause they associate spanish with latinoamericans
omg this is exactly what I though when I first heard the word
My mom is american and i grew up reading in english, just inventing the pronounciation for things, or just reading it how a spanish would read it
Most of my Harry Potter names were pronounced precisely how you did
Not to mention McGonagall, i read it wrong once and kept reading it wrong, to the point that someone mentioned her and i wondered who they were talking about lol
I read it as "mac-koh-nal"
The word Té us very commonly used in Spain, but spanish from Spain and spanish from latinoamerican countries have some variations,.so Im not sure about Ecuador
Vale, ya entiendo :)
Delicatessen and hamster are used
Also pistola, acordeón, vermú.
Yes, I have received the catalogue in the mail previously, it's even advertised on TV every year
&#x200B;

No, you are not the only one
Our shops were offering Xmas foods and we were still wearing flipflops
I talk about Madrid
We went from flipflops to boots in 3 days, literally
I'm curious, why do you hate snow
I live in Mallorca, there are a lot of germans here and I have no bad words for most of the ones I've met, in fact I was surprised to discover that they're not as cold as the stereotype says (or maybe the ones that are like this don't come to live here)
During WW2 we were kind of neutral but we had volunteers fighting against the soviets with the germans so there was no anti-german feeling back then
There isn’t many anti-German feeling here, probably since a lot of Spanish people used to go to Germany (and still go nowadays) looking for better works
We do have harsh feelings against British people because they come to put beaches and trash everything and jump from our balconies killing or severely hurting themselves in the process
And maybe the French, for tricking us into thinking they would just invade Portugal and leave us alone :(
not in spain
well, maybe that thing about humor we do think, yes
In Spain no
But it is of someone that thinks like a Nazi, for example, someone racist, or a supremacist
I would say some cities think the opposite
Yeah, Germans are highly appreciated in Spain
There are friendly jokes but nothing offensive
You can say this about every other country too
There's nothing to ignite the lint when there's no hunger, no poverty, so don't worry, you'll be fine
I had an uncle who was very involved in geopolitics and economics that would rant about the implications of german banks in the 2008 crisis and current involvement in many european concerns
He was so passionate about the topic that sometimes it seemed a bit overboard
However, he was actually very well read, was invited often to TV interviews and had no ill-will towards the germans, just a bit of a judgement towards some policies & attitudes (see, austerity measures) that were contraproductive
Hey, that’s me
The thing in Mallorca is that British get all the bad reputation so people don't focus that much in the drunk germans
Yes, I don't want to offend brits but you go to Magaluf (mostly brits) nd Cala Ratjada (mostly germans) and the difference is like night and day
Brits get crazy, fighting, puking on the streets, jumping on cars, having sex on the beach 10 meters away from the streets where hundreds of people can see them
It's crazy, while drunk germans are not worse than drunk spaniards
PS: I know those people go there (to Magaluf) exactly to do that and are not representative of the british society
No offense intended
Danone was founded in Barcelona by a Lebanese guy
Super random, but I didn't know Carrefour was actually French
It just seemed so Spanish to me, I didn't question it
Wait wait wait, the one thing I thought Spain invented, Nutella, isn't Spanish at all
As someone who doesn't know German
Haha Weiner art lmao
I don't know, it was a dumb thing from when I was little, so I never questioned it
Therefore, I thought, it had to be Spanish
How do you pronounce Nutella
Do you mean your tea
Habsburgs together, stronk
Nu (like a cows mooo but with an n) te (like té) la
If it was a spanish word it would be Nuteya lol
I suppose, I was born here but my parents are British so it sounded Spanish enough for me lol
It could be better, faster and with more resources, but is one of the best things Europe has: Universal Healthcare
It would be definitely a good idea for the US
The thing is, US is made for enterprises and not for people, from my point of view (which I don't want to argue about)
I keep hearing things like having to pay hundreds for insulin, kids selling lemonade to pay for their parents medical expenses, having to pay for giving birth
I can't imagine the stress I'd be into if I didn't have universal Healthcare backup in my mind
Proposing the privatization of the Spanish Healthcare system is such a politically suicidal move not a single major party proposes it
If someone tried to do it anyway, he'd face major riots
We take it completely for granted
It works out well because it not only allows everyone to have access to healthcare, but establishes a minimum level of quality for private insurance as well, for people who want something better and can afford it
This means that private healthcare is also quite cheap
Well, my mother is Spanish, so I had it pretty easy
But I would suggest consulting with your local Spanish embassy/consulate
*My mother has cancer and had surgery, and treatment for 20 years already
*My father had heart surgery, and trauma surgery (that one last month)
&#x200B;
*I have no idea how much that cost
You just go to the hospital when you feel bad and that's it
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
in Spain is payed **thought taxes**. So for poor people is even cheaper as it's a progressive payment
(insurance in the US is flat)
Works pretty well and Spain has one the most **efficient systems** (great service and also being cheap for the government: Spain ranks 3th in efficiency behind city-states Hong Kong and Singapour)
Also **drugs are covered**. Tho middle-to-rich people has to pay a symbolic payment (1€-2€-4€)
&#x200B;
Healthcare is seen as a "national treasure" and people can't understand the US thing
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
*Note: US already spends more (%GDP) in PUBLIC healthcare like medicare and so than Spain for universal healthcare (US around 9% GDP in public money while Spain 8% in universal healthcare)
So most probably universal healthcare in the US would be super expensive
One of the reason is college costs
While in Europe is "free", few people in USA can afford to be doctors
This makes medical professions highly demanded and labour market make those salaries impossible
In Spain medicine studies is so demanded that there are doctor everywhere
being a doctor is just middle-high salary, not rich at all
This makes healthcare cheap
(there you have the* ***relationship between healthcare and college costs****)*
*Also, since there is only one costumer for medical supplies and drugs, the costumer --aka* ***Government-- has the monopoly and disproporcionate market power****. The government buys medical supplies though auctions
This brings the price of this items to almost the cost of production
Yes it's free, yes everyone and everything is covered, the only downside is that it's slow
You can wait months to receive test results sometimes
That said, you can always still get private medical insurance
I'd also like to point out that with a prescription the price of that medicine is greatly reduced
I can't tell you by how much off the top of my head, but I pay 3€ per month on allergy meds
I did it
It works out pretty well
Europe is rad
Do you have a way in to a country with public healthcare
Family members and such
>Another thing to consider: many Americans (myself included) have excellent healthcare coverage through our employer
Replacing private plans with a one-size-fits-all universal plan subject to public funding doesn't sound attractive to us
Do you believe that private hospitals and/or private health insurance does not exist over here
So Silicon Valley yuppies would have to pay redneck's healthcare
Doesn't sound bad
Also private plans still exist with public healthcare, and they are much cheaper
Yeah it's possible
I hope so, for me it's very sad to listen about people dying because they can't afford medicines
USA just wouldn't be as powerful without its workers and army
If you have citizenship of one EU country you can choose whatever country fits better for you
For retirement, Spain and Italy usually are the chosen ones for other EU citizens
Good health care, cheap housing and live cost compared to the north and far better weather (unless you have problems with hot weather)
I love Spain
If I didn't I wouldn't have stayed for 15 years
We've got areas and cities much wealthier and much more expensive to live in than others so every single one of our [autonomous communities] manages it's own healthcare system (think of it as California managing it in it's own way, Texas it's own way too, etc) and yet our healthcare system is still great and free for us
We obviously pay through taxes (apparently, 9
4% of our GDP), but less than what is spent in the USA (>17% of GDP)
There is plenty of private hospitals and private health plans
I just checked for myself and there's some plans without co-pay and most range from 40€ to 70€, I guess per month
I haven't had one of those yet, so I'm not 100% sure on the details
The first questions from americans are usually "doesn't it suck
" and "how about the wait times
", so check this: [
>The Spanish health care system is ranked as the 7th best healthcare in the world, as indicated in the year 2000 in a report by the [World Health Organization] Spain is ranked 1st in the world in organ transplants
Wait times *are* long for operations, but if you want you can pay out of pocket at a private hospital or go through your private insurance
If you go to an emergency room you will be looked at as soon as possible (those who are closer to dying will go faster, it's not a first come first serve)
We've got a lot of [health tourists] coming every year because our healthcare system **is** good even when you have to pay for it because you're not a citizen
&#x200B;
If I understood the situation correctly we are paying less in taxes *and* we don't need to pay after a hospital visit *and* we have optional access to private hospitals and health plans
and we aren't even #1, there's a bunch of countries who have it better
If you were living here you'd be paying less in taxes to sustain the healthcare system and your excellent plan would probably be 90% cheaper (or your wage would be higher because your employer would not have to be providing you with an expensive plan)
I'm saying all of this in a "look at what you can have" way, not just like "look at what *we* have". Vote for the right candidates and they will try to implement something similar to this
and with the US economic power and already existing great hospitals and doctors it could very well become the best healthcare system in the world
>Spain and Italy usually are the chosen ones for other EU citizens
Fun (kinda sad) fact: some towns have majors not able to talk spanish because most of the population are retired Europeans
I see no problem with it
If most population is german/ british or american/canadian is not that hard that the major is from those countries
I know
I'm just saying it's kinda sad that they left their country, bought enough property/spent enough time to gain citizenship and started electing their own on a different country
Something about 70 years old people away from their homeland makes me feel weird
They are welcomed tho, don't take it wrongly
All water in Spain is drinkable without any health problem, but the taste in the north-east is dull
And don't start me with memes about the water from Madrid
Tap water is what I drink everyday
I only drink bottled water when I travel
It depends on the region
Close to the mediterranean is often very hard to drink so people buy bottled water
Definitely, but btw depends more or less in the region, my region has one of the hardest water due to the high content of Ca and Mg in the ground that makes it really hard, good quality but really hard, my best friend use bottled water in his house but I don't know more people that do this tbh
It depends a lot in the region and the quality of the soil
Here in Madrid virtually everybody drinks tap water
In Málaga however you might find the opposite
No, at least where I live
Tap water in Barcelona tastes horribly
Here its pretty common
But i recomend you to buy a glass bottle since the plastic ones dissolve slowly since they are not intended for continuous use while the glass ones are designed for a continous use
Allow me to talk about the agua de Madrid
(it's a meme here, drinking tap water is common in all Spain but in the Canary Islands)
It's so common that "agua de Madrid" has become a meme due to how supposedly good it is
In other regions it may not taste so good but it's still very much drinkable
There can only be a problem in secluded regions where they may use water from a well
Yes, bottled water is quite common
Tap water is safe to drink, but many households still prefer to drink bottled water because it tends to taste better
This is partly regional, as some regions have better-tasting water than others
Barcelona in particular has extremely hard water and many people can’t stand the taste of it
in my town the water gets really bad during summer so i avoid tap water usually or drink very little if im thirsty
in other cities they have much better water treatment plants and people dont mind drinking from the tap in most of them, but i think bottled water is still dominant
It’s common here
In Madrid I always drank tap water because it’s very good but now that I live in Málaga even after installing an electric water softener I find the water too hard and usually drink (cheap) mineral water
Tap water unless I really need to drink water, then I go buy it
Even though my city's famous for it's water
in spain you only use water bottles if you have to carry it because you are in school or somewhere without a water tap in general
its funny how in some places we take pride on our tap water being better than in other places, although if you live near the sea the water probably isn´t potable
but i haven´t traveled enough to know if that is true for every place near the sea in spain
Water in Madrid is good, yes
I live in London and drink tap water, it's hard water but it's fine
I used a Brita tank for a few years, but not anymore
I can't blame him
Maybe I have not expressed myself correctly
&#x200B;
What I mean is that it slowly degrades over time, not that it literally dissolves,
&#x200B;
You will have noticed that for example if you use a bottle for months it will begin to be weaker, it is not that you will have a hole
&#x200B;
Sorry for the confusion jejeje
well i live in the dark zones so thats why i see tap water as the way to go
I'm currently learning French and a bit of German (C1 in English and, of course, native in Spanish)
I keep forgetting words in all 4 languages I hate my life
All the time, I speak English at work and with many foreigners so quite often  when I get home  I don't know how to say something in Spanish or catalan and only the  English word comes up
Quite infuriating, honestly
There hasn't been even one time I have thought "aguacate" before "avocado".
Often, mostly because I'm trying to get to the level of an English speaking native
I can struggle a lot in normal conversation, when my brain is thinking on a different language than the one I'm speaking in, and I have to translate everything before I say it
I doubt it happens to most people in Spain, though
It's more likely to happen if you're above the B2 level, in my opinion
Often, the other day i was playing (?) Word coach with my mother and as It went on i understood more english than spanish
Quite often
I spend a lot of time on the internet and talking to internet friends, which has helped improve my English a lot
So then I get the awkward situations with my rl friends in which I'm thinking of an English word but don't know the Spanish word and I have to explain it
I remember one time I was shopping with my mom and I wanted to told her we needed onions, but I couldn't remember the word in spanish (cebolla) for some reason
So I told her "necesitamos onions" (we need onions) and my mom stared at me with a strange look
I'm sorry mom I just couldn't remember hahaha
Happens really often to me
I work in tech and I've only worked abroad and in English
So I'm basically unable to explain what I do in French without sounding like an absolute illiterate wanker, using English words every 5 seconds
Oh, this is interesting
I feel like this is a problem that Spanish people don't usually have, since there are always some translations of most fantasy books, even if some are fan-made (those tend to have poor orthography, but they're free, so they're an acceptable option for those who don't speak English when there isn't an official translation)
It's a bit of a double edged sword, though
We have access to a lot of books in our native language but at the same time most people never learn any foreign languages properly
Such a mood
I often use incorrect anglicisms in Catalan, catalanisms in Spanish, and Spanish grammar in Mandarin (my home language)
Not letting a friend invite you to a drink when they are decided to
Like i've literally seen several screaming arguments because of this
Spain: do not assume that flamenco is the national culture
IT IS A SOUTHERN THING
In absolutely every TV show in the UK that takes place in Spain (and there are many) they insist on playing flamenco sounding music even when the show is about Catalonia, Galicia or the Basque Country, for example
It is infuriating
Talk about politics
You could lose friends because of that, since people here are heavily divided, because, whatever some guy say, the Civil War wounds are far from healed
Dont call us mexicans or colombians and dont use their esteriotipes on us, and dont use their expresions with us
our esteriotipes are allowed if you have a good relation but be carefull if you find someone that dont like it
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
also dont talk abaut politics never, it isnt relevant the relation, NEVER talk abaut inmigration politics and of course the civil war or the ww2
&#x200B;
do not try or say if someone is from Catalonia or the Basque country
and just to prevent  Galicians also no
The nationalities are a problem so dont talk abaut that also
I would like to add something to the discussion but it seems everything is allowed in Spain
I do it constantly with s scottish friend
He calls me lazy spaniard
Oh, we do that here as well, especially in small villages
>Don't say no to an old woman who is offering you a cup of tea
What if I absolutely despise hot tea
You Russians are so funny
2 meters
Your buble has a 2m radius
I mean for covid this is awesome but for normal life i'd feel as if i smelled weird or something .
Also, no farting seems like s good rule
I went once to a sauna in finland with a friend and his finnish friends and there was a lot of fake sexual straight gayness going on tho
You obviously don't attend people in your job
In Spain we use Holland always
Sometimes when politicians make a speech that is meant to be international they use Netherlands, if not, always Holland
In Spanish the Netherlands is litteraly translated to Holland
And Dutch is "Hollandish" or basically language of Holland
Sure we have a specific word for Netherlands but hardly anyone uses it
Man, not at all
Spain does not have real big NOs actually, just be friendly and get used to extrovert, talkative people
It is NOT a Southern thing
40 years living in the South and I have never, ever been to a tablao
I don't even have a clue about where the hell is even one
In Spain, depending on the people around you, you could be cheer up, killed or even watch a mini civil war just in front of you
It is very likely that you will bleed if you do that unless everyone around you start to give you back the nazi salute
Fachas y Rojos, nothing else
On behalf of Spain, sorry
Also, putting chorizo on macaroni, is it ok if
That's good for companies as people will have a worse time figuring out their value in the job market
I find the first rather weird, as in Spain we have stronger regionalism and say usually the city or province we are from
Canarian and Balearic people usually call mainland Spain "la península", for that matter
Depends on where you are living and the type of floors
Tiles might be ok, but if there is wooden floor you instinctly ask: Should I remove my shoes
Then if you live in Andalusia, the chances of having mud from the rain on your shoes are minimal, where I live in the UK it is 100% guaranteed you will have a solid centimetre of mud all over them haha
That's Xenophobia, not racism
Equally stupid and despicable
I've been living in London for three years and I had a few episodes as well about speaking in another language
The worst was two Scottish girls were teaching me a few Scottish words on the train to Edinburgh and a old man (bald, really red face like is going to blow up, very fat and smelling like beer) starts to yell at us saying "Speak English, you are in England" We were already in Scotland
So one of the girls call him off and said something like: "Speak Scottish you bloody gammon, you are in Scotland"
After that he became violent and the train has to stop one station before Edinburgh and was arrested
AMAZING
But it's funny watch a Spaniard, a Portuguese and an Italian, each one speaking in their own language but being able to communicate (if all speak really slow, I mean)
Yep, written are very, very similar, but as a Spaniard I understand Italian better than Portuguese
The first part, yes
Like come have a drink with me or else
The not accepting a drink is honestly more like offensive
Don't stop at letting people buy you drinks with no complaints
You should also start letting bars in your capital give free tapas
Yes, but it has to be similar to what the other is having (or maybe lower alcohol but deppending on the situation you can come out as weak)
Like for instance i just can't do shots
well americans see us as mexicans
and your flag is similar to the mexican flag so
if you make a joke abaut an spanish with an esteriotipe is good but you dont want to do that with a esteriotipe of another country
is like if you go to portugal and speak in spanish, its frustrating
same thing here, i don't even know why italians don't hate us yet
if they do it
We also have others such as Galician in Galicia, Basque in the Basque country and although there are people who consider it a dialect and others who consider it a language, there is also Valencian for Valencia
Nah, I'm Andalusian and if you call me as any other autonomous community I'm not  even to bother to correct you
It is not an issue
Valencian is another dialect of Catalan
I know some people like to think it is another language but Linguistics says it is the same language
Some people don't like it because they are anticatalanist, other people because they think a dialect is less than a language
It is not
Everybody speaks a dialect of a language
You should not
He is not the UK
> You pay for sitting, breathing and being generally alive here
Lol article 155 should be implemented exclusively to bring free tapas (back
) to Barcelona
Either a gin and tonic or a shot but of a lower alcohol %
In spanish, we have the word "manjar" but it evolved to only mean delicacy foods
I've just seen a video of Bald and Bankrupt in Albania and he talks to Albanians in Spanish
Spain has the highest youth unemployment in Europe
If only we made the minimum wage higher
that would convince people to hire young folks
It surprised me that I’ve been looking for a while and can’t find anything for Spain, and I guess that’s something Spain gets one of the lowest points in the rank: thinking that we’re a good country
We have SO MANY good things it’s honestly astounding and yet we’re still so surprised when we hear that foreigners actually find Spain to be such a good place
bruh I read this and immediately went like "no, obviously Spanish people hate their royalty more"
Luce mejor tricolor
The Spanish flag holds political right-wing connotations
Half the country doesn't feel represented with it
Maybe they're republican or smth
If they change the flag, i'll change with it, i personally don't have any opinion about it
Nah, we reserve that kind of hatred for other Spaniards when we discuss about the Civil War
Never with europeans (we haven't had any war with any european in the last 100 years so no one alive can remember) but the amount of latin americans that want us to know how "we" stole their gold is infuriatingly big
Not really
The only time I had a akward conversation was with an American that before asking for my name said: "you guys did a cool genocide in Mexico, how do you feel about it
"....
To which I replied, "I don't feel any connection to what the Crown of Castile did 400 years ago, still natives were integrated once they converted to catholicism while the US in the 1800's (when you are supposed to be more civilised than in 1500) were still killing natives and enslaving people"
He didn't say anything else
Imagine twi of your grandparents being on the republican side and the other two in the national
well when your empire was disolve and you have one of the bigger ratios of deaths of civilian and everione that enter the peninsula dedicates to destroy your infrastructure and industry and you where even an ally
is hard to support him a lot
i agree with you
The best answer to that is to say: Do you realize that the ones who made that cool genocide were your ancestors and not mine
My ancestors stayed here working on the land, yours went there killed a lot and raped a lot more
That first part sounds like the script for another "8 Apellidos Vascos" sequel, honestly
Chiuis
What's that
You mean "panchitos"?
No, because this was not a war of North vs
South, nor blacks vs whites, nor rich vs
poor, not a war that confronted two distinctive groups each with its own identity, but a war of literally neighbour against neighbour, friend against friend, brother against brother, son against father, people of you own blood who literally lived under your same roof killing each other, and so on
Then, after 40 years of settled dictatorship, it was called kind of a tabula rasa from a compromise between all parts involved in all the previous years
This would have probably ended badly, the people in favor of the dictatorship still had too much power back then
Even now it's really hard to uncover all the crimes they did and to get rid of their statues and monuments
This same week they had to send the police to watch over a property that belongs to the state and that is being recovered from the descendants of the dictator, to ensure nothing will be stolen or sold before there's an inventory of everything it contains (  )
It's infuriating because I had nothing to do with that, I don't have to take responsability for any of that
And even if I had to be held responsible for what my ancestors did, chances are my ancestors stayed in Spain the whole time and had nothing to do with that while the ancestors of those latin americans telling me that we stole their gold are the spaniards that actually stole their gold
The irony
You are right
Kind of
Native Enslavement was abolish with the Burgos act in 1512 by the Emperor
Additionally it was  re-abolished in a new law in 1837 meant for metropolitan Spain although no slaves were present in the peninsula since 1766 (when the government bought all the slaves and freed them)
Only Cuba and Puerto Rico, which had a special status, managed to keep slavery until the Spanish first Republic ended slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873 and in Cuba in 1886 (although it was locally forbidden to have new slaves 1880)
The Spanish-american war was nothing to do with slaves, but rather imperialism, monroe doctrine
what some people forget is that many of the people dont have the desition to chose their side
if they send you and you say no well thats not going to end well
He probably said Kiwi like the fruit (), I've heard that slur used sometimes for southamerican people
That was an pro independence war
Just like the philippines-US war
Apparently spain having colonies and fighting pro independence guerrillas was bad, but Americans having colonies and fighting pro independence guerrillas 1 year later is fine
Mmm maybe "machu", a few years ago was pretty popular to call them "Machupichus" because of a very popular TV show, and "machu" was a shorter term
I think it probably was "chipi" , I don't know what it means/why is said but I heard racists call people from South America this
Well yeah, there's a reason why Guardia Civil is not popular among young spanish people
Wanna know a "fun" fact about la manada case
It was not the first time they did something like that, absolutly scumbags
imagine judjing a police corp that has 78
000 member for 2 guys
I'd say a mixture of Mediterranean diet, Mediterranean weather, and Mediterranean culture, which involves warm friendly people and laid back attitude, which leads to less amounts of stress and depression
I don't think that climate is key, even though it helps
Parts of Spain have a weather more similar to Kazakhstan (exaggeration) than to Barcelona
And mountains, lots of them, same for Italy and Greece
And a huge part of Portugal is a rainy windshield
Maybe the higher amount of sunlight does it
Food contributes as well, but I'd say it's because of the quality (fresh food is much cheaper and easier to find), because in our modern stressed societies not many people follow a strict stereotypical Mediterranean diet, and in some regions it has never even been a thing
A more relaxed lifestyle
Hell no
Try our work culture and ethics and we'll see you fleeing back in a week
It sucks big time
To me, the main reason is a healthier culture when it comes to social interactions and more integration within everyday life
Although it happens too, the level of self isolation other cultures set up is unseen here
I'm generalising, but we don't need to schedule a meeting to socialize, or depend on alcohol consumption to do it
It's more spontaneous
It's overwhelming at times, but it helps preventing social issues and mental health problems
Also, even if for many reasons it's not optimal, our family oriented culture helps old people feel more accompanied and integrated, so they not are happier and are looked after better
Because we have exciting human interactions everyday and we eat better
Also our healthcare system is quite good and the weather invite us to be less sedentary
Something to bear in mind is that in Spain (think it’s the same in Italy) the northern regions, which I wouldn’t define as Mediterranean in terms of weather, diet or culture, actually have larger life expectancy than the proper Mediterranean regions
[Source in Spanish]
It’s way more complex, and just saying “mediterranean” is a bit of a blanket statement (not trying to be offensive here, apologies if it sounds like that)
I fully agree that society, family ties and attitude make a massive impact
However, I actually have some doubts on the impact of food
Spain is in the European average in terms of obesity, so we are not doing things that well in that field
Having very good healthcare, often better than in richer countries, helps a lot though (I am living in Ireland and how I wish our healthcare system was as thorough and competent as the Spanish
I would add that our culture makes us less prone to cut family ties and therefore if things go wrong you always have the support of your people emotionally and economically
We also have an amazing free (paid with taxes) healthcare
At least in the Spanish case we have a really good healthcare system too (I think it ranked behind Singapore and Hong Kong in a survey last year)
Also, it would be interesting to see how does life expentancy varies between each region (here in the North the Mediterranean diet is also rather foreign, and our climate is shittier than in the East or the South)
Wealth may be a factor to explain not differences with other countries but internal differences within the countries, though, don’t you think
In Spain there’s correlation, the regions with less GDP per capita have lower expectancy
The Basque Country, Navarra, Madrid
are at the top, whereas Ceuta, Melilla, Andalucía, Extremadura
are at the bottom of the list
Is it the same in Italy
And your dad sounds right
A couple of glasses of wine, great food and good company are medicine for the soul
The historical equivalent to your North is the Basque Country and Catalonia, as they're next to the French border
This industrial development, compared with the rest of Spain, was also another reason for the rising of independence movements in both regions
Let me guess, those "expats" you tell about went to the Canary Islands or Ibiza/Formentera
Spain's worklife is very stressful
Longer working hours (the mandatory rest for lunch in most companies makes the day way longer), low salaries, high unemployment and a bad work culture of just spending hours at work
Outside work, Spain is amazing, but inside it, it is pretty bad
So I don't think GDP is only due to hard work and stress, there are plenty of factors that affects it way more
I was amazed when I found out seguridad social covered my vasectomy
As my dad always says: we are beings of sun and water
Of course
Croatian seaside is a sort of heaven
Hahahahah well at least you're not in Finland
I see what you mean, but if we look at those standard wealth indicators, there’s a clear gap
Also, from a personal level, my financial situation here is way more comfortable that what would be with the same role in Spain (as for pretty much all qualified roles)
What you say makes sense but I have no problem in admitting that, by the usual measures, Ireland is a wealthier country than Spain at the moment
There’s a link in a comment below (actually a response to other of my comments) with data for Italy showing opposite conclusions, with most Northern Italian regions at the top for both sexes
Perhaps it’s wrong, no idea
I agree
Air pollution effect on life expectancy is something that is not discussed well enough
But not the other things
\+ /u/King_inthe_northwest
[Here's the data for Spain divided by regions] Esperanza de vida al nacer = Life expectancy at birth, Mujeres = Women, Hombres = Men
Honestly this doesn't seem to correlate with mediterranean diet or warm weather, Madrid is top and there's a extreme weather there (very hot in summer and very cold in winter)
We're also told it with the countries flipped, but referring to the Italian mentality (aka "progressiveness/open mind") rather than economic development
We don't have a Milano, but we don't have a Naples either (maybe Algeciras can qualify)
Oh, you are absolutely right
Being childless and without health issues makes me biased
Costs for both here are astonishing
My friends with kids in Spain laugh when we talk about childcare costs here
Makes sense thinking like that
Those blue zones are extremely lucky spots, but the averages tell a different story
Going off on a tangent, it’s a bit sad how we tend to focus too much on the Mediterranean image of countries as Italy or Spain while forgetting about the parts of the countries that don’t fall in the Mediterranean stereotype, which are quite often as interesting or even more
Don’t get me wrong, who could dislike Sicily or the Costa Brava, for example
but there’s way more to our countries
Sure, one thing does not cancel out the other
I also live in the North of Spain and although my region has low life expectancy in general quality of life is overall better here (the only thing lacking being the weather department)
Not wrong, the French system is not free (OTC), you have to pay for your appointments and you get a partial reimbursement of what you paid
Probably OP was referring to a single "universal" public system free for the user
I think we and the UK are the only ones having this kind of system
No, I'm not wrong it's multi-factor
You'll see many countries with one thing or the other but very few with all of them combined
Sorry, I meant economically when comparing the cities
I thought the North would be more progressive, I didn't know that
> Probably OP was referring to a single "universal" public system free for the user
I think we and the UK are the only ones having this kind of system
The Danish ~~and Swedish systems are~~ system is also beberidge-style and totally free
And a lot of other countries use a beberidge system, like Italy or Finland, I don't know if they have a copay or is also totally free, but i'm sure a lot of the other beberidge countries are also free
I understand that’s what OP meant but even considering that, I still feel like a majority of people gets more value from living in Ireland than in Spain
It’s a subjective appreciation, I may be wrong, and it depends a lot from where in the country you live in and your job, but it feels like the salary gap, which may actually be more noticeable in unqualified roles (minimum wage and lower tier salaries are almost double here, even considering the recent minimum wage raises in Spain) and the significantly lower % of taxes we pay in Ireland make up well for the increased cost of living
If it was the opposite, we’d have more Irish workers in Spain than vice versa
again, I may be wrong
Do you have any reading comprehension
Do you even understand what multi-factor even means
Shall we check the life expectancy in Poland
You have free healthcare but it's useless if the other factors are shit whereas if you have some of the other factors but a shitty healthcare or have to pay for an expensive insurance your life expentancy will also be lower
Oh sorry, I made a mistake with that, then
The danish one is free, though
Understood
I agree with your bias, that perspective is incorrect and leads to wrong political decisions
Let’s just summarize what I meant saying that raw economical data can be used to prove the thesis that Ireland is wealthier than Spain at the moment and that my personal experience leads me to think the thesis is right
Is that correct
The only thing I disagree with is the language barrier, it’s not symmetrical
Fully agree about the Irish side of it, but not the Spanish
Most young Spaniards with a decent level of education nowadays can speak enough English to, even if struggling the first few months with accents or needing some supplementary lessons upon arrival, be able to work unqualified jobs here
We are still mediocre at languages compared to you Scandinavians or Slavs
but the situation is not as horrible as a couple of decades ago
However, said that, I don’t like the stereotype of Spaniards (or Portuguese, or Italians, or eastern Europeans) moving abroad to wash dishes
Most of my Spanish acquaintances either here or in the UK come to work in engineering, research, industry
Some of them may have needed some unqualified income during the first months, until their English was fluent enough, but just as a first step
Spanish people without career aspirations often don’t last long away from home or don’t dare moving abroad
Exactly
I don’t even think we disagreed as such in the main topic
My picture as immigrant
you have it up there, but it’s true that I may have adapted better than average, so other people may give you a less rose tinted version
Who knows, in few years it could be me moving to Sweden
Anyway, thanks for your responses and all the best with the naturalisation
Nice to see some positivity
it's frankly refreshing
Not really but this seems funny
Do teachers comply
Hahah
AFAIK no, but I have a story
The last grade of high school (17-18 years old) usually ends like a month before the other grades, and some schools have a little graduation ceremony (I didn't go)
The year I graduated, my colleagues went drinking after the ceremony and actually showed up at school the next day, drunk, even though our classes were done
I was at school to get my certificate (they gave them at the ceremony but again, I wasn't there) and I first heard chanting and shouting, and then saw a bunch of teenagers dressed in formal clothing, completely drunk, invading the school halls while the teachers tried to kick everyone out
It was hilarious
I love this more now
Does this even happen in the university
Its funny
in American films they use Mexicans as Spaniards
But when an American  actor plays smart and tries to speak spanish you just go: I didn't understand anything xD
So I always wonder when they talk chinese, Russian or else, if they are really saying anything at all or just making noises for the American audience
It often comes off as very bad spanish and kinda takes me out of the movie
Usually with some thick american accent
I liked The Man Who Killed Don Quixote because they had most people speaking their native language and acting as their real nationality, so it was really natural and the accents when speaking other languages that werenn't their own didnt annoy me at all
They're using bows and arrows because Magneto can control metal (so he can control guns)
I kind of if like it if they show something of someone from Spain, but most of the time they put a mexican accent or use slangs from central/south america, so the moment is ruined
When did they speak Italian in HIMYM
Spain here, yes it is
Sometimes you even ask the route they're taking etc
Because you know,  being polite to someone who might help you in a rough environment is always helpful
Yeah, it usually is
But I do it mostly because I can't bring myself to look the other way after making eye contact, lol
People you pass in mountains or small villages are the only cases where I've seen consistent salutation here
Really
Where in Spain
I think that the words I repeat most throughout the day are hello and good morning
I've lived in a couple of cities in Spain (Barcelona and València) for 40+ years
Never heard anyone saying hello or good morning to people passing on the street unless it was someone they already knew
If it was in the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, it was probably "Adeu" ("Bye" in Catalan)
>For instance, films and TV shows in Poland have neither subtitles nor dubbing, instead we have one guy reading the script out loud as the movie goes
Like a poor man's version of dubbing with one guy reading all the lines in a monotone voice, I haven't seen anything like that anywhere else abroad
But why
Why not instead just have subtitles
If the guy is reading a translated version to Polish of the script, better then just save the money on the guy and don't that stupid thing and have subtitles

Gran verdad
Oh boy
My father told me he was very surprised about how responsible young people are in that regard, when this year in my birthday party almost none of my friends wanted to have even a single beer because they all drove there (we're all in the mid 20s)
Apparently, back when he started driving (about 35 years ago), drunk driving was very common and not even frowned upon
The police would stop you, see you're wasted, and basically say "just drive carefully, okay
" and let you go
Hold up our 1hour late just because we can't never be on time
I would pay money to watch "[I think my father is the Krampus]
Thanks to botellones and the like, public drinking isn’t allowed here either
The police might (hah) turn a blind eye, but it is a heavily-fineable offense
It felt so surreal going to Germany, and seeing people chugging bottles of beer in the metro  o.O
How many wolves do they need to kill before they are accepted back home
What's the difference
That sounds reasonable and makes sense, thanks for making me understand why it exists
I mean, their point is to give established safe times to cross
If it is safe to cross at a non-established time
that’s up to you :)
That being said, I personally try to wait for the light to turn green unless I’m in a hurry or with others (initially because I can’t expect others to do it if I don’t, but now out of sheer habit)
Although I do have a non-negotiable exception to my exceptions: it doesn’t matter how much of a hurry I’m in, if a light is the kind you press for it to turn green, and someone pressed the button, you better believe I’m going to root my ass to the ground until it turns green
It makes my blood boil to see someone push the button and immediately cross the road
I hate that I do this myself (bad habits die hard if you don’t put your heart into it)
But honest moment
Even if we were to correct our timezone, people would still probably have late lunches
Because habit
I have friends who find having lunch before 14 inconceivable and very European
(Nevermind that we are the weird ones, not them)
Afaik you still kill them but outside the ring
It's not part of the sadistic show, but it's still fucked-up

For the love of the universe, we are coming off badly in this thread lmao
"No me cuentes cuentos chinos"
"Don't Tell me chinese tales"
It's used when you acuse someone of making excuses
In Spain we call "turk heads" to people who is accused of something they didn't do to favor the ones who
did it
That also happens in Spain, except that everybody agrees on what portion of the groceries they'll but each, so that it's fair for everybody, that way there's no need to send any pay requests and everybody is still happy
We call it ~~"Brasileña"~~ Cubana lol
We call that *sentarse al estilo indio* (to sit Indian style)
so we can conclude that it comes from the time Cuba was spanish
interesting
Gus Fring from Breaking Bad speaking Spanish: [
He doesn't sound like someone who speaks Spanish, let alone a native speaker (Gus is supposed to be a Chilean)
Every time Shakira sings in Spanish
I get half of what she says
In Breaking Bad, whenever Gus Fring speaks Spanish
Many times I had to turn on subtitles to understand what he was saying
Most "Spanish speakers" in the series have a weird non native pronunciation, but Gus' accent can barely be called an accent
If you consider Latin American Spanish and Spanish from Spain the same language, tons of times
I had a Canarian friend and Sometimes when he stepped in the gas
i had no idea what he was saying
It happens almost every day if you live in the South of Spain: most of the foreigners expect us to speak some English, French or German, but some of them try to speak a bit of Spanish with locals
Sometimes we can understand them, sometimes we cannot
[Galician
Yeah
It also happened to other characters, sometimes played by actors with Spanish speaking background and good accents
Quite often, their lines looked like direct translations from English that didn't sound natural, although they might be grammatically correct
For example, in the video you have linked the Mexicans say "la DEA está fuera de límites", which was probably written first in English as "DEA is off-limits". I understand what they mean in Spanish, and the grammar is right, but I wouldn't have chosen those specific words to say that we aren't allowed to do something (killing a DEA agent in this example)
I understand that "Spanish heritage speakers" that have grown up in the US often mix up both languages, but in this example the Mexicans are supposed to live in Mexico
Of course, I may be wrong and perhaps people from Mexico say "fuera de límites", but that isn't something you'd hear in Spain
I don't think this is a big deal, it's just that it caught my attention when I watched the show and I think it's interesting
Actually I thought the same with Better call Saul actor Michael Mando
You can tell he doesn't speak Spanish and the few scenes with his father your can see how the other actor is fluent and Mando just learned his sentences
No one commented anything about the Narcos actor who played Pablo Escobar and even though it's obvious that he's Brazilian his Colombian accent was remarkable
Not perfect but he worked really hard
"Breaking Bad" was the very first example that came to my mind
I understand tho, it must be near impossible getting a single Spanish-speaker in the US to help with translations and pronunciation, let alone acting
Isn't the Lleida accent also very thick
Breaking Bad: Gus is supposed to be Chilean, but his Spanish is clearly not Chilean
Nor any other Spanish spoken country
The actor speaks very slow and with a strong Anglo-Saxon accent
To be fair regarding the slang, since he is constantly working with people from Mexico and no Chileans, it’s perfectly reasonable that he would deliberately refrain from using regional words
As a Spaniard when I speak to Latin Americans, I know they won’t understand certain words so I try not to use them (for instance I will say “baño” instead of “servicio
Well, I guess it's the same if you hear an australian or a southerner from the US with a thick accent and using slang words
Or if an american hears someone from a small town of Scotland using slang words
I mean no one commented in this thread
Honestly, I don't think it was bad, I have Colombian friends and I think they just wanted a Colombian actor so nothing else would have worked for them (I can understand, I've seen more actors playing a Spaniard with Mexican accent than I can count)
But I think the guy really worked hard and all in all was a great Escobar
¿So was their Swedish as fake as their blond hair
The funny thing is, that a McDonalds manager here in Spain can earn more money than some graduates after the same time
Here people outright say that if you don't study you won't get any job
In my house it was "loading concrete sacks into trucks". Probably customized for me, since I'm very physically lazy
It worked, I studied computer science
There's also that tongue-in-cheek one, that if you don't study you'll end up as a "Guardia Civil".
That we are not a bunch of bullfighters, flamenco dancers and lazy fucks who sleep siesta from 3 to 5 PM
Siesta must be done from 3 to 7 PM, everyone knows that
I was asked in the subway by some American tourists where they could get the best Spanish traditional tacos
Also, our tortillas is nothing like the Mexican ones (they're omelettes)
Almost everytime I talk to an american and I say that I am from Spain, I have to explain that:
\- We are not mexicans and we don't speak like in soap operas
\- Spain is in Europe (Some of them get really amazed when I tell them ''we are just south of france'')
\- No, we don't (usually) like spicy food
\- No, I don't have italian or french ancestry, people in Spain are usually white because, spoiler: there are rainy days here too
\- Aaand no, weather isnt always great
Ir isn't wierd to be spanish and have pale skin and blue eyes
We aren't dancing " flamenco " all day
I mean, you have ladders right
I'd add that we are not doing fiesta 24/7, only most of the time, when we are not sleeping
I didn't know people ate reindeer meat
I'd like to try it
I guess s/he confused Sweden with Switzerland
Bonus: (changed some information to protect my privacy lol)

\- Toledo, It's a city near
\+ Oh, so you are from Ohio
\- Am I a joke to you

By the way, this is not pretty common in English, as they had the great idea of adding the word ''new'' to any city that was founded with the same name as one that existed previously
Thats extremely offensive
Some of them are also done in the morning
I heard it a lot in real life
Can't help but roll my eyes

The use of maps in education is very lackluster
I believe maps are a very powerful tool for teaching, but they're not used as much as they should
And many times they are just wrong

Eso es bueno, ¿no
I don't support mandatory vaccination
I think educating people to get their vaccines and prohibiting un-vaccinated to attend public schools are better for ensuring that people are vaccinated
Forcing people to do something just seems wrong
I support it
Vaccination should be mandatory except for those who can't for health reasons
People will find a way around it, only education will solve anti-vaxxing
Here in Spain lots of anti-vaxxers just fake their papers with even the help of (PUBLIC
) anti-vax doctors, it's really stupid at this point
In my opinion it should be mandatory, on top of that I would not even let people in the country if they don't proof to be vaccinated
(For the EU it would be impossible, but for the rest they must)
Whats the worst/funniest english translation you've seen in your country
Mine
In a beach restaurant i once Saw "rape a la marinera" (seaman style monkfish) translated as seaman style rape
There was an awful translation in a restaurant in my hometown that became viral few years ago
A quite popular one pot stew of my area (although there’s few other variants across Spain) with several kinds of meat, vegetables and chickpeas is named ‘cocido leonés’. Leonese stew would be a reasonable translation
What did the restaurant translate it to
‘Cooked lions’
I saw in a local bar "cola cao" (the national chocolate powder beverage) translated as "tail cao" to English :P
Lol, it's donut or berlina here, a Berliner is a berlinés.
I haven't read much about it but I got a notification from the Euronews app about it, congrats
Now is your perfect oportunity to finally restore the khaganate
Does this mean that there's going to be a transition to democracy or some democratising reforms
Because they (the party/junta/whatever) might simply appoint a new dictator and keep things like they used to
>Bonus question: Would you support the idea of European Las Vegas
A few years ago Eurovegas was a project that was being discussed and it was theorized that it would be built in the south of Madrid, in a city near where I live
Most people disliked the idea
It would've created a lot of employment, sure, but the general sentiment that people had around here was that it would only cause trouble
I don't remember why it didn't become real though
I think they decided to go to Asia or something
I live in a small town in the Mediterranean coast
Usually our pop
is 25k\~, and in summer its 3 times that number
And I can guarantee you that almost everyone new here during summer are tourist (the rest are ppl with summer houses), and I can understand why they are trying to change their image (not like I don't like tourism, its our main source of income AND usually its a new way to met new people), but most of the time, the tourist are drunktards that are always drinking, smoking, and trashing literally every place, from disco to cultural places
Not to talk of the people that literally comes to commit crimes (yes, there are thousands of cases of drunk people destroying properties, puking and leaving their trash everywhere, or even raping
By the way, did I mention the balconing
A practice that kills several thousands every year
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I think they are just doing fine whit that image change
Bonus answer: Yes, definitely
Anything made together with other Europeans would be awesome
I'm in Ibiza right now
No party this year (not as it uses to be) but Ibiza has a lot more to offer
Anyway I don't think Ibiza's clubbing fits that well in that 'party-destination to get wasted' definition like Magaluf does, for example
You pay 60€ to enter a club, a small bottle of water is over 10€. This is not the place to cheap-partying
You don't come here to get wasted, and if you come for that you have a huge pocket so nobody will care
Ibiza here
I have mixed feelings because massive Party tourism is pretty annoying but a lot of people (including my family) live off this
Take into account that before tourism Ibiza was extremely poor and isolated, but if people behave It would be better
I live in Benidorm (cheap ibiza) and I don’t really mind that our population is 8 times bigger in summer, also is like playing gta irl
I'm studying tourism and I can tell you that every year we are told how they try to promote ibiza in a different way
But in reality, they just want to be less dependent of it, while still getting all the money it gives them
There are more alternatives now
Maybe some extra laws to reduce noise and regulate people, but nothing has changed much
I think only Spanish people do different stuff
Old people and families, while the young and the international tourists keep doing parties
I'm a teenager from Barcelona, the top 1 touristic destination in Spain (in number of visitors)
My parents work in the sector, so I know some things about the issue
Here, luckily, we have many kinds of tourists
There are people with a lot of money who come here to visit as much as they can, low and middle class families that spend their holidays and
Drinking tourists
They drink, go out every night, piss in the street, sleep in the street, scream, play music wherever they want (loudly and at night, especially)
Edit: Have I mentioned "balconing" is a real thing these tourists do
It's really funny
They jump from a building's first or second floor to a swimming pool
Of course, the latter are the fewer, but they're also the louder
Because of that, citizens from Barcelona are getting mad at all tourists, and they want to regulate even more the sector
Most drinking tourists are British, so maybe there will be less people like that after Brexit
Sadly, I think this is a problem we'll never get ripped off
Edit: About Eurovegas (the project started, I think), I think it would be nice to have all those people in one spot, away from cities
Great that they are trying to move away from it, but I wouldn't say that specific type of tourism has too much of an affect on the locals unless you live in the areas where it's really popular
I live about a 10 min drive from Magaluf but you wouldn't know it, the type of people that go to Magaluf or Playa de Palma don't tend to explore much so we just never go to those places in summer
Party tourism tends to be very localised, Mallorca is bigger than Ibiza but it isn't huge, yet there is soo much more to see than Magaluf
The biggest difference I've noticed is the lack of mass tourism, obvious given the circumstances, but it's been like an unexpected breath of fresh air
For a collective population on the islands of around 1 million people we had 16
5 million tourists last year, the majority between June and September
Almost any beach you go to or vaguely attractive town is rammed with tourists but this year, for a short period at least, we could enjoy those places just for ourselves
Even this year a lot of the popular places are busy with tourists again, just not to the ridiculous levels of usual
So in my opinion changing the type of tourism would be nice but the main issue is unsustainable tourism growth, which I'm sure is the same in pretty much all the places OP mentioned
The problem is, at least in the case of the Baleares, the local industry has come to rely so much on tourism that without it, or even in lower numbers than usual, a good portion of business would just collapse
**TL;DR** Better tourism would be nice but less mass-tourism better
Opinion will vary depending on whether your business relies on this
Mallorca has only land to plant some fruits and vegetables, fishes and tourists
We could survive without tourists, but we would live way worse
The plan didn't work not because some people disliking it but because they wanted a waiver from the Spanish general legislation in some aspects (e.g. They wanted to allow smoking inside) and that was a no-no
I agree with you
Just wanted to mention that several thousands death every year from balconing is a humongous exaggeration
According to Wikipedia, in 2018, there was 6 balconing incident, and 3 deaths
We speak a dialect of catalan called Eivissenc
If you know someone here you can go to places only known to locals, Who are way better than the crowded tourist areas
Most of them are in the north (Sant Joan, Sant Miquel Etc
Yep
I had been multiple times to Amsterdam, but last year was my first visit to Rotterdam and I loved every minute of it
In all honesty, I can't recall the details, but the general consensus was the proposal in general sounded shady as fuck
Besides, It came in a time when lots of corruption cases linked to PP went public, and some notable figures of the party endorsed a Spanish Eurovegas like crazy
They also wanted difference labor laws allowing people for working a lot of hours for little money, that was illegal for Spanish and European laws
I don’t really think that creating employment form tourism is our best choice
I think it’s one of the various reasons our economy and society are like they are
Just take a look at all of the coast in the south, where most of the people live from tourism
It has ended up being the area with more unemployment and poverty
Sure, people that own the hotels are probably rich, but the medium person is not
I’m not sure what would be the solution, maybe industry, but definitely not tourism
Yeah, I exaggerated it a bit x)
Also look at how are we now post-lockdown
We are in the same situation than in March but we're not closing borders and quarantining a bit harder because that would mean the small profit we're making from tourism would go to shit and our economy can't afford that
Sure tourism gives a lot of money and faster than other sectors, but we're fucked now for relying on that
Yeah I know, that's my complain
Spain has been relying on tourism too much for too long and now we're going to see the consequences of building an economy around it
I don't know, we do have production and manufacturing though but maybe not as big as other countries
Tourism has always been the big, fast way to make money here and manufacturing, research and production are slower forms of making money
And any efforts on making those bigger and better get pushed aside, because to see actual benefits to it you need 4 years or more, and that doesn't get you votes in an election
The country needs money, it gets it from tourism, so why bother would you bother in other sectors
Massive tourism as one of our biggest forms of income started during Franco's dictatorship to try make Spain look better to the rest of the world I believe
And from there we just went with it I guess
It's a fast source of money, it also helped to develop a big industry around construction (which was the primary cause of the 2008 crisis in Spain)
But now I'm stepping in something I don't know too much about so take all of these with a grain of salt
We're doing fine, other years we've been at >40° in June in my city, this year we didn't reach >35° yet so it's pretty nice
Everyone bitching while we have been getting 30-35°C in summer every year Lmfao
This week I’ve finally gotten used to the scorching temperature indoors :)
Living in the north of my country
Having a nice 17-19ºC today
I'm in Murcia and today I felt like my skin was melting
every summer i contemplate the idea of moving up north
Which part do you live in
I feel like this year isn't as hot either, usually our poorly insulated house gets to like 28 in the summer, but it stays at 24ªC.
iirc, it's quite humid in the UK, which makes heat unbearable
Besides, the UK doesn't (didn't) usually get this hot, so neither they, nor their building styles are used to it
Actually that last bit is important
Their houses (along with northern Europe's in general) are built to *retain* heat, whereas ours (AUS and ESP) are designed to *repel* heat
Heck, until sometime last week, I myself was dying in 28º *indoors*, because I hadn't gotten used to it yet
Being spanish I don't get it neither
Like, old people and workers literally die here in summer, why on earth people call this "good weather", I'd rather be at <0°
Same here(Spain), it feels like summer started 2 months ago and now we are entering hell season
The comment was a joke, obviously, as for me these temperatures have been the standard all my life so I just do the same every time, turn on the AC or a Fan
What isn't a joke is wasting water
Where I live, in the south of Spain, water is not something you can waste like it's nothing, I go to a little city on the coast in summer to spend the time near the beach and every time I'm walking around and see water spilled on the ground I get angry as heck, mainly because I know that the ones that have spilled the water are either not from this region or just from a country located more to the north because clearly they don't value water enough, also that city has only one method for getting drinkable water, a machine that removed the salt from seawater or whatever and that is already almost not enough for all the small city
Value water
Step 1: Having always lived in an area that gets dry-hot /s
But seriously though, nothing groundbreaking
- Cross ventilation
- Maximise the cooler times of the day:
- I lower my shutters to about 3/4ths at around 12-14 ish to avoid the sun getting in
The hotter the day is predicted to be, the lower it gets, but do try to let some air come in
However on particularly hot days, I lower it completely, ventilation be damned
- Completely opening the shutters and the windows at night to let cooler air come in
- I have a small industrial floor fan pointing upwards that can practically create its own mini-hurricane
I personally prefer pointing the fan up, not directly at me, but you do you
- Additionally, I have a cheap hand fan in case things get too unbearable
- Starting next week, I'm probably going to bring down the toldos (awnings
) because the above starts failing when it gets too hot
- If we get into the 40º region, I'll probably be forced to turn on the aircon
Sillier things:
- Water is (obviously) your best friend
I always have two jugs of water cooling in the fridge (I do this year-round, though, so meh)
Spraying on water like you are in a photoshoot helps too; I try to make it as erotic as possible, just to get a chuckle out of the situation :P
- I am personally fortunate enough to be able to reorganise my schedule to have a quick siesta in the afternoon
Yeah, here too
About 2 weeks ago it was cold (compared to the weather before) so people went back to wearing jackets and not leaving the house too much, and then it slowly got warmer and it's like summer now (tho not as hot as other years honestly), and it hailed and stormed the other day
It's like the weather has commitment issues
Yeah "guiris" love spanish sun, that's why make fun of their red burned skins :D
Seriously, even I get burned easily in Spain if I don't use sunscreen, what make Northern europeans believe they can deal with spanish sun
It's like going to Russia in January with just a t shirt and a hoodie
Spain is a great country to visit, but if you come in summer you better take some sunscreen and drink a ton of water if you don't want to die
As a Spanish we also have the same problem
This is due to the fact that industrialisation happened near the big cities, which consist of the Eastern coast, the North and south, and the capital
While the interior is heavily agricultural
Because of that, people emigrated to these industrial cluster
Leaving their villages in search of work opportunities
Many villages became abandoned, or have an old population
It still happens nowadays but not as exaggerated as it used to be
We can still feel the effects of it
It is very common that some families travel to the interior of the country in what we call "irse al pueblo" (going to the village)
This consist of spending usually a few days in the village where your grandparents and other family members live, and then going back to the city
I hope this helps you understand
It might not be the same situation as your country, but it might give you an idea of what might be the problem
As a Canadian, I feel no connection what so ever to the United Kingdom
As a Spaniard, I feel no connection what so ever to Latin-American countries
As a Spanish-Canadian, I feel like I don't 100% belong in either place
My experiences growing up in both countries are way different than any of my local Spanish friends or Canadian family, so it's hard to relate
I would want to read this for sure
"Children come with a loaf of bread under their arms" means newborns bring joy in Post-War Spanish
When you are a lucky person, on Spain people say that you are born with a flower in your ass
Or, when you are saying that children bring joy, you say that children are born with a loaf of bread under their arms
In Spain when a child is born and its followed by good events we say "the was born with a bread loaf under his arm"
you forgot dutch
Every si gle tourist invaded town in the spanish mediterranean
Kilometres of same looking tourists houses and resorts along the coast lf artificial beaches
The best example might be benidorm or Torrevieja
The spanish mediterranean (from barcelona to valencia) is a very good example of how tourism can make places ugly
Most Spanish cities have an area that was developed during Franco or a bit after between 1955 and 1985 that is completely trash: tall buildings very close to each other
Those buildings look dubiously constructed and they are shit inside, no natural light, cold in winter and hot during the summer
Corrupt developers ensured they didn’t have to allow for green spaces, parks of other services
Large parts of Spanish cities lack access to green areas in those developments
The examples in Granada, my home town (which is a fairly pretty and touristic city) would be: La Chana, el Zaidín or Camino de Ronda
Parla was voted ugliest city of Spain a few years ago
Haven't been there but if It won against Puertollano
It has to be ugly
In Spain its said to be Parla but ive been there and I dont think its that bad honestly
God
that shit in photos induces depression
Who thought of building It
It is so strange and sad to think about that
Even if it has never really been a visually pleasing city, worrying about artillery shelling really is a whole different level than complaining about ugly city centers
Hope the situation gets better for you guys soon
For a while I wanted to visit Donetsk and eastern cities in Ukraine
Is it possible for a tourist to enter Donetsk with the current situation
Benidorm is a good example of (spontaneous) environmentally responsible tourism:
1) It doesn’t take a lot of land, being developed vertically
2) It allows for many budgets to afford a beach destination
It’s not Dubai or Santa Monica where the rich have single homes
3) It consumes less water/electricity per person than single homes
4) It costs less to tax payers to maintain, as the tourist population, that comes mainly during the summer doesn’t pay taxes to fund things like garbage collection and local police and that would be difficult to provide in a more spread out model
So, despite its ugliness, Benidorm is equitable and environmentally friendly
Why are we Andalusians always excluded when we talk about the Mediterranean
Everyone knows that the Mediterranean reaches the Pillars of Hercules in Cadiz and then the earth ends, in a great black vortex that spits out everything that falls on it over the Caribbean
Pablo Alborán sings very well, but he doesn't deserve to have a sea with his name #AndaluciaEsMediterranea
También te digo que Lleida, Vigo o Eibar son desproporcionadamente más feas que Salou, Santa Pola o Gandía
I've been to chiatura
It has a special vibe
postapocalyptic
It's so ugly and tacky and it lavks all sorts of charm
It's an eyesore for my soul
You're prettier though, it's not that massive apart from Malaga city and Torremolinos
Hahahaha
Your elderly seem to love retiring here
They never speak spanish though
Prueba Parla, Puertollano y Fuenlabrada
I thought Vigo was quite ugly
Buffff
No se yo, eh
Con lerida la verdad que estoy de acuerdo, no se me había pasado por la cabeza
Vigo no se
Igual es que es entorno natural me engaña
Yes, I expected it to be difficult
Thanks a lot
Nos han programado para pensar que proveer de vacaciones a la clase trabajadora es feo y no tiene clase
Mientras, vemos documentales de casas fantásticas en calas preciosas que valen millones de euros
Si Benidorm fuera así, ¿cuánta gente se podría permitir unas vacaciones en la playa
Si quieres sitios salvajes y bien protegidos todavía hay lugares como Cabo de Gata que son fantásticos y puedes ir a acampar
. El norte entero o cadiz no son para elites y son mucho más bonitos
La simple realidad es que el mediterraneo se lo han cargado a golpe de urbanización cutre y hortera
Bueno, nadie te fuerza a hacer las vacaciones allí.
Honestly If you think about it, USA is so overrated
My theory is that peopel in Europe take less sugar, or rather than people in the USA take wayy too much sugar
Excessive sugar can cause abrupt mood swings
[heres a map of sugar intake]
[Sugar worsens mood rather than improving it]
from what i've heard, they use something called "Corn Syrup" and put it in almost anything you can think off, because its a cheap substitute of sugar since its subsidized
so even burger buns have this corn syrup thing
Article 1
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of
law, which advocates as the highest values of its legal order, liberty, justice, equality and
political pluralism
National sovereignty is vested in the Spanish people, from whom emanate the powers
of the State
The political form of the Spanish State is that of a parliamentary monarchy
Good thing we have a version [published in English] because I can barely even understand legal texts, let alone translate them
Anyway:
**Article 1**
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of law, which advocates as the highest values of its legal order, liberty, justice, equality and political pluralism
National sovereignty is vested in the Spanish people, from whom emanate the powers of the State
The political form of the Spanish State is that of a parliamentary monarchy
Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of law, which advocates freedom, justice, equality and political pluralism as highest values of its legal system
Well it's kinda nice
That’s why (article 1
3) it’s officially the Kingdom of Spain
Not really
Trust me, a lot of people try and have tried
I think it's more because of our long history of absolute monarchies and dictatorships, in which the governor got absolutely all the power
We are still a monarchy, but the king does not have that much power
We vote, (and that way the sovereignty is on us), and we elect a president/party to govern
Technically yes, but this, and the rest of the articles dealing with the Crown are protected, which means the procedure for reform is incredibly hard
An old woman approached me in Venice when I was like 16  she gave me 10€, smiled, and then she left
I went on a school trip to Paris when I was 16
Just four days, but I got plenty of weird stories:
* The first day, we arrived at the hotel and the very first thing we saw was two guys having a physical fight right in front of the entrance
* A boy got food poisoning from a bottle of water he had bought from a street vendor
* We visited Montmartre and some random black guy asked my friend (who had dreadlocks) to take a selfie with him
* The same guy had to share a room with me and another boy and the first night it was late and we didn't know where he was
He knocks at the door at 3am, comes in, says "hey I'm kinda high", slips on the floor, falls to the ground, gets up, eats and entire bag of cookies he had on his backpack, then gets in the bed and falls asleep
* My schoolmates and I were coming out of the subway station near the Moulin Rouge and the street was so crowded there was a woman riding an electric scooter and couldn't really move
She accidentally hit one of my classmates with her scooter several times and didn't even realize
Then the boy started shouting at her in Spanish
Turns out she could understand Spanish and the first thing I see is a furious woman shouting "I SPEAK SPANISH JUST LIKE YOU" with a heavy French accent
And I got even more stories lol
Last Spring, I had just arrived to Munich when a guy in Marienplatz talked to me about something in German
I don’t speak German so I didn’t listen to him, and then he started yelling at me when he saw I wasn’t paying him attention hahaha it was very funny
* One evening we were sitting outside of a restaurant with our teachers, waiting for the rest of our classmates to finish their dinner when we saw a delivery guy riding his moped on the sidewalk
One of our classmates (he's hella weird tbh) pointed at him and said WHAT IS HE DOING
and the guy got off his moped and started to yell at the boy and our teachers, then tried to fight them while yelling I SPEAK SPANISH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY
* Some random guy in the subway heard my friend speaking Spanish and got really close to her, then said 'hola, española'. My friend is the most Slavic-looking Pole ever
* It was a girl's birthday so someone started singing Happy Birthday out loud in the metro on our way back to the hotel and the entire class started singing too while I cringed silently
Then they decided Happy Birthday wasn't enough so they started to sing Christmas music even if it was June and some random drunk guy started singing while holding as my classmates were singing
To top it all off the day we were going back home we had to face the most French problem ever: air traffic controllers on strike
Our flight was delayed but even that was funny lol
It was an unforgettable trip, and I also had the chance to meet an internet friend, which was a great experience
The bottle was probably kept in anti hygienic conditions
I just stayed in Granada in a flat shared with other tourists
My bf and I had a room for ourselves and we paid 10€ per person, so it does have its advantages
Obviously, it wasn't remotely fancy, but it worked out fine
There was also a big white cuddly cat :3
Streets full of drunk teenagers
(Botellón) New year without a couple of teens having ethyl comas is not a decent new year's eve
The guy in the fountain surrounded by two girls had the night of his life
Probably Andalucía. A mostly rural region with a very high population, which means unemployment is rampant these days as most people cant make a living out of farming
Add a poor industrial network to the mix and you have a really hard place to get a decent job
Still an incredibly beautiful and historically rich region tho
Andalucía, they deserve so much more
I'm surprised at my fellow Spaniards claiming it's Andalucía. At least there things such as industry, tourism or actual cities exist
Sure there are bad zones like Algeciras but that's all about it
Even the poorer is not Andalucía (which is in fact one of the richest regions) but Extremadura, which got the poorest people, the poorest town of the whole country, etc
Melilla on the other hand though
absolutely crime driven to a level nowhere seen in any other place of the country, 0 opportunies, separated from the mainland
I personally feel sorry for Galicia, in northern Spain
It's such a beautiful land full of amazing people
They used to be a rich independent Kingdom, both Portugal and portuguese language are direct descendents of the Kingdom of Galicia, and old galician was a very important langauge in the Middle Ages in the iberian peninsula
But now it's just a poor and abandoned region, and not even their own autonomic politicians care about Galicia
I would say Extremadura is worse and more abandoned
>A mostly rural region
Bruh every region in Spain is heavily urbanized, and Andalusian 'towns' are usually quite big
The main issue in Andalusia is the lack of jobs because the industry went downhill
What about Teruel
Probably the most abandoned province in Spain
Una polla
Yeah sorry mate, you're wrong on this one
In comparison with the North, Andalucía is rural, it has big cities, but a lot of its population works the land, im not saying that there is not industry, but is one of the less industrialized regions in Spain in relation to its area
The main issue with Andalusia is that there has never being a significant industry to begin with
The region was in decadence for two centuries before it began to have any significant revival in the late 20th century
Aragon in general, with the two Castilles are quite bad at that level
And Andalucia has big cities, tourism and everybody knows it
Ceuta and Melilla aren't paradises either
What North
The problem of Andalusia is definitely lack of industry but not comapred to its area but to its population and to how urban it is
Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha have a similar area to Andalusia
Those are rural regions, not Andalusia
Andalusia has 3 of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in Spain and a population a million bigger than Catalonia
Ok, I wasnt clear enought
By "the North" I mean Green Spain, wich is by far the most industrialized part
Of course, there are regions in Spain way more rural than Andalucía, but there is few people living there, like Teruel
The problem with Andalucía is its huge population, thats the big deal, it wouldnt be such a bleeding problem if Andalucia had a small population, but there is 8,5 million people living there
Probably a lot of you know about this, but I feel like a lot of people think we were neutral in WW1 and WW2 because we just didn't care or something
Before WW1, we had had a lot of civil wars, most notably "Las Guerras Carlistas" and between WW1 and WW2 we had our civil war, from 1936 to april 1939, so yes, we were not going to join another war just 5 months later
We were destroyed inside
A lot of people were enemies within the families, Spain was divided in two, and we were in a dictatorship and in poverty
We were not able to join (although Franco tried to be allies with Hitler)
Los reyes magos in Spain, it's like Santa Claus but here is more popular
That's a very mild civil war
We never learnt about it in school
On the other hand, we had our own heretic movement with ties to Protestantism called the *alumbrados* (enlightened ones)
It was limited to the urban elites of a bucnh of important cities and it was brutally suppressed by the Inquisition so it didn't have a lasting influence
But it is there
Plus there were spanish volunteer troups on both sides too
The spanish troup was the first one to go to liberate Paris if i recall correctly
But the main reason we didn’t fight in WWI was because we lost a huge share of our economy due to the American-Spanish War and the loss of Cuba; then, Eduardo Dato decided to not enter the war and instead, just provide both sides of the conflict with food, clothes and whatmore
The problem, again, came back because we sold so much food outside that our population didn’t have enough to eat
I've been studying the first decades of the XX century in Spain
Man it feels like a super exciting adventure-politics-Game of Thrones series
I literally stood up when I read how the Second Republic was proclaimed
Spain's history is just full of interesting details and interactions, and some events have famous paintings related to them which only makes it x100 more shocking
For example (wikipedia images linked),  ["The Second of May 1808"] by Francisco de Goya illustrates the popular protests people did in 1808 against the presence of French troops in the streets (Spain was getting invaded by good ol' Napoleon)
Also, my personal favorite, ["The Third of May 1808"] by the same author, shows the shootings the police and the troops perfomed the day after against the protestors
I could go on for days
Francisco de Goya did A LOT of this shit and honestly I love all of it
Also the Spanish-American War between the Carlist Wars and the Civil War
I actually know of it
So interesting
I do remember learning about it, as it's part of our history, but i don't really remember anything specific about it
Yes, that's true
I just wrote what came to my mind first
Lucky you that can see our history like something beautiful and enjoyable
I need to study all the Spanish history (since prehistoric times) for selectividad (the university entrance exam) and I'm hating it
It's not that I don't like history, but the way we have to memorize everything to the smallest unimportant and uninteresting details is horrible
I wish I could enjoy it more
But you are right: XX century is a lot better but I have fallen asleep in class with other eras
Hey we're on the same page, I'm also about to do the selectividad in a month
Good luck on your exams, man, I hope you do great
IDRK in what subject/autonomous community they make you learn all that crap, but it sure as hell sucks
In my Spanish history subject we're only seeing centuries XIX and XX
Honestly before those i'm not interested at all either
I'm doing the Science bachelor so my hell is prolly different than yours
But hey, it's a bad month ahead of you, once you get it done, you never have to worry about the visigoths or Al-Andalus ever again
Be strong, you got this
This goes for me too lmao
Ohh cool
Good luck too
I have finished my exams, it's only selectividad left
I'm doing sciences too, but here (Madrid) spanish history is mandatory and he'll to all sciences students (and basically everyone)
At least I like the maths, physics and chemestry, but I'm with you, it's difficult (although I find it more difficult to study history than any other subject, except spanish literature history)
You're so lucky to have only XIX and XX centuries
I would pay for that, man
What community are you from
(It's ok if you don't want to answer, but I'm curious
You can dm me if you want)
Only one month left, yaaay
I want to finish this shit once and for all
We are almost there
Un último empujón y lo tenemos
Here (Comunidad Valenciana) spanish history is mandatory too, but I believe it's approached differently depending on your bachelor
I don't know why we start on the XIXth century though, I guess we did learn everything before that last year
For me, the whole history-literature thing is hard to sit down to, but once I get into it I get REALLY into it lmao
It's nice you enjoy maths, it's a burden not to like it
Also you were able to choose physics AND chemistry
Well shit I would have liked to do that but we had to choose from two options
You either took physics + technical drawing (what I did) or chemistry + biology
Oh well
Technical drawing is beautiful too, but it's way harder to *understand* than anything else
Our teacher sometimes motivates us by talking about "a new phase in your lives" and "getting the fuck out of highschool after all this time" and it honestly works for me
Here in sciences you have two options: biosanitario (includes chemestry + biology + physics/geology as optatives) and tecnológico (chemestry + physics + industrial technology/technical drawing as optatives)
At least it's like this in my highschool, because it's pretty big, but maybe in others it's different
And maybe it's also because I'm not doing only the Spanish Baccalaureate, so they adapt the subjects to the other Baccalaureate
Yo estoy haciendo tecnológico con tecnología industrial, porque en primero tuve que hacer dibujo técnico y me costó bastante
Eso sí, es precioso
Me gustaría haberlo hecho si no fuera porque iba a tener que estudiar 10 veces más que en tecnología, y no iba a tener tiempo (haciendo dos bachilleratos a la vez y tal
Perate estás haciendo dos bachilleratos a la vez
Madre mía estás bien
Mi instituto es bastante pequeño, o sea es de un pueblo de 8000 habitantes, así que muchas optativas no se llegan a cursar porque se la han pedido 4 en total
Si no se mete bastante gente, no se cursa
Por eso en teoría tenemos la optativa de tecnología pero nadie sabe cómo es ni nadie la ha visto en su vida
Como el 60% de la gente se metió a informática y el resto a francés. Somos unas basic bitches
Yo el año pasado me metí al biosanitario, con biología en vez de dibujo (esa era la única diferencia lol) y este año me he cambiado, con lo que tengo Dibujo Técnico I pendiente
Oh well
Buena decisión, biología según algunos amigos míos es empollar y empollar y empollar, ya te tiene que gustar para no pegarte un tirito
La verdad es que dibujo técnico es to bonito y es de las que mejor se me dan, pero como no entiendas algo cuesta mucho remontar
Tecnología solo dimos en 2º de la ESO e hicimos el típico [puzzle] con formas que se puede resolver de varias maneras
Buena experiencia pero ahí se quedó.
Using a restaurant's or a bar's toilet as a passer-by that won't buy a thing, instead of as a customer
Spaniard living in the USA
In Spain I would say having lunch before 1pm or dinner before 8pm
You can do it, of course, but we will say you are having a brunch or a snack
And some restaurants are not even open for lunch or dinner before 12
30pm or 8pm unless you are visiting a very turisty area
And in the USA I would say no tipping in a restaurant
Technically legal, but feels illegal
Even if you just tip 10% or less seems like you are gonna be a terrible person
Some places, when you pay with card, shows in the screen 4 options to tip: 15%, 18%, 20%, or 'Other', so if you wanna tip 10%, you have to click other and enter the percentage while feeling observed
I'm glad in Spain we only tip if we felt like the service was good and they deserved it
Bonus: As a valencian, making any yellowish rice with things and call it paella
Well, you can do it, is legal, but it feels so wrong for us
Mixing coke and wine (kalimotxo, it has to be spelled a bit dangerously) is legal and drunk by plenty of teenagers (including me) but it feels bad after certain age
In Spain asking for free tap water is common and normal
Although the quality of the tap water varies a lot from town to town
> the country’s largest facility for "uneducable retards"
world's first reddit meetup
I am surprised it’s not actually trespassing lol
Oh wow, I much rather have takeaway or order food on mondays, when I have less time to cook and the week just started
I do feel like pizzas belongs to fridaya/saturdays tho
About the second, same with my dad
He always gets mad with that
I'm not sure that would be legal here
Ya, maybe it's more common in the south but it also dependsnif is weekday or weekend I guess
It turns out I knew how to cut the cheese (lol) without being French
Anyway it makes sense to get full taste, rim and center
It’s makes sense too how the size of the portion changes with how strong the cheese is
The payment thing
They can't demand a payment for a glass of water either
Not my language, but in Portuguese there’s the word “saudade” which could be loosely described as that feeling of longing someone or something
We use "¡" and "¿"to indicate the start of exclamative and interrogative sentences respectively
Ñ is a letter of our alphabet (it's not exclusive to Spanish, but is a very Spanish thing)
The only repeated double consonants are rr, ll, nn and cc
Rr and ll change the sound respect the single consonant
nn and cc are separated in different syllabes corrección-> co-rrec-ción
It's a phonemic language, feature that shares with Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Finnish, Czech, Polish and Latvian and some more
In spain we have a special word for smuggling and black markets called estraperlo, due to a scandal in the 30's. [
In Galician we also have a few stuff
* **morriña** \- kind of longing for your home and your people when you're abroad
"homesick"
* **Riquiño** \- comes from "rich" but means something like "small cutie" or "lovable".
* **Seica -** Contraction of "sei" (know) and "que" (that)
Equivalent of "seems like"
* **Daquela** \- Contraction of "de" and "aquela". Equivalent of "then" or "therefore"
We have lots of contractions that Spanish doesn't have aswell wich makes Galician feel more natural to speak and conversate imo
* Galician | Spanish
* da = de + la
* dos = de + los
* aos = a + los
* cun = con + uno
* cunha = con + una
“Mil” (thousand) is the only number in Spanish without an “o” or an “e”. All the rest have one of these vowels
We have the same but in arabic and latin
Olive is oliva (latin) and aceituna (arabic)
The way some words change meaning depending on where they have the strong syllable
"Abrazo" means hug
"Abrazó" means he/she hugged
Also our use of accents
In English, we have phrasal verbs
Basically a verb + particle(preposition) that takes the place of a phrase
Depending on the combination of verb and particle it can have many different definitions and or contexts
In spanish we say alá (allah) instead of god a lot of times without realising that is the same word
It might be not the only language in the world but i think is a good input
Can you explain what that is
"Rico" in Spanish can be cute/lovable too
Didn't know morriña was Galician because it's widely used by Spanish speakers too
Also I find weird that Andalusian have a lot of contractions too but it's seen as vulgar or wrong instead of a property of the language
In Spain we also use it, but the word is "Ahora" ( no sé poner cursivas :c )
\-illo, -ito, -ino, -ico in Spanish depending on the dialect
Edit: the word for this suffix in particular is "diminutive"
Japanese counting system is one of my nightmares as a student of the language
Ultimately I feel defeated, acknowledge that I'm just a gaikokujin, and use 『-つ』for mostly everything
That's a cool trick
Nah, even obscure basque features like Ergativity exists in languages like Georgian and others
He refers to the meaning of "later", which is weird as the word "ahora" means "now".
It's true, but in this case they aren't the same thing
Mosca is fly
We have mosquita for little flies and mosquitito for little mosquitos
Ohh I see
Cool
In summer, noon in my town is after 14:30
That's one of the most stupid things I have to bear
Don't care one or the other
But only one
I have a few weeks of confusion ahead because the light outside does not seem right, and I have to wake up one hour earlier than what my body tells me it is normal
My current coffee supply is not going to be enough
Definitely winter time
Spain is already in the wrong time zone so 11PM in summer is technically 9PM and it’s still very hot making sleeping difficult
Yeah, it usually takes 10 to 14 days for me until I do not notice the effects
Today it has been
bad
Sleeping was bad (too early to bed, too early out of bed) and it will get worse
I will  probably have headaches in a few days, and a general feeling of fatigue (starting to have it)
And just now the light outside seems too damn bright
(You are very lucky
You can borrow mine any time
When it works, it is great
When it doesn't... well
there is coffee .
We are always at the top on organ donations and have one of the most efficient public health systems in the world
We were the first country on history to pacifically transition between a dictatorship to a democracy
We decriminalized gay marriage in 2004
Super early
I had a connection in Brussels airport once and I don't doubt for a moment that what you say is true
They might as well build the halls out of chocolate
oh wow that's beautiful
№ 5 on the list, checking in
Sunshine and copious amounts of olive oil will keep us strong
This is incredibly wholesome
Yeah well
is that really saying much considering that the main reason we transitioned was because that bastard died while he was still in power
For Spain I can say that dog on the streets doesn’t mean stray dog
I’ve never seen a a stray dog, and I live in Barcelona and have been to Madrid, Valencia, Murcia and Andalucía. Some rural areas as well
Cats, indeed, but not dogs
Yeah they almost always have an owner, they're just more outdoors dogs, you can tell because they're always well fed and their fur is well kept
There are definitely stray dogs, not many in cities but they're a pretty common sigh on small rural towns
Doesn't mean they are living on misery, usually people feed them and some of them are actually fat
Never seen them in Almeria
More than nuclear plants, actually
A fake mediterranean island, where you can have all the scum of Europe together with context in a beatiful setting
Chavs, drug dealers, russian mafia, corrupt politicians
Costa del Sol, with some kind of Marbella city full of mafia, rich people and corrupt politicians
Minsk in 1999 for me, it fits completely
I'd say Madrid, because it has a lot of drug dealing, you can drive on the streets like a madman
Barcelona and their narcoflats sounds nice, i dont really know about other countries much so i cant say about them
or alternatively a story about the narcos in galicia during the 80's opening up a cocaine route from colombia into europe
Either Belfast or Bilbao
London, but I'd like rockstar to add different cities and you can travel to them by train or plane
I don't think Ibiza would like more negative publicity, tbf
We can have even gangs of all countries with names based for some reason on bad food stereotypes
"The Underground Paelas"
"The Pastatzi family"
"The Baguettis crew"
"The Frankfun10 team"
"The pretcelli gang"
And so on
Not a city,but galicia
It’s always those two cities (and Rome)
Agree
Could be Malta
I didn't know about Just Cause, looks very fun
But it feels like it lacks the satire I was hinting at with my idea doesn't it
with it being a fictional total dictatorship and all that
Yup
But instead of "the passione" they have some guys that literally kill for pasta
"Las Ramblas" street in Barcelona
I just don't get it: expensive bars, bad food and way too many people
The only  authentic barcelonese experience you can have there is getting your wallet stolen
The thousands of restaurants with "Spanish" food served that are run by asians and instead of paella they serve rice with yellow colorant
Ibiza
Tourists ruined it
Barcelona probably
Madrid center is expensive in general because its a rich area, but prices on barcelona are way more affected by tourism and people have to pay a higher cost of living because of the influx of tourists
[Heres a map of tourism in Spain] with most red areas having "tourist traps" probably
The best paella is not in Valencia but in the towns near Albufera
Almost every restaurant of the Valencia center are turist traps
Restaurants in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid
Isn't Plovdiv the oldest city in Europe
I didn't know it was touristy
How is life there
The good thing about las Ramblas is not the street, but the neighborhoods it has at each side
El Gòtic, Raval, Born, this is the good stuff
I was in Pisa and you're absolutely right
Only Chinese people, nothing "real" of traditional there
I heard it's a nice to chill for a few days/weeks (for people living there or sow travellers)
I'm surprised to hear now it's your typical bleak and fake touristy city
This reminds me of when some german friends came to visit us
We took them to the area with all the bars, really popular and we were looking for a restaurant to eat at
All the restaurants in the main square were full of tourist and our friend suggested we eat at a certain restaurant
He said he chose this one because the other menus were all in several languages, and this one was only in Spanish, therefore the others were aimed at tourist
Our restaurant was more "primitive", but more for locals and more authentic
Another time we took some friend to another restaurant i'd never been to, and it honestly didn't look like much from the outside, just like a normal bar full of old men
But it was the best León food i've ever had
Just go for the more "rundown" and typical restaurant for an authentic meal
I went to the one in NYC and it seemed quite big, maybe just because i was 13 lol
The highlight for me was "seeing" famous people and comparing my height to them
I distinctly remember being just as tall as Miley Cyrus at the time
Amsterdam is very charming, and the museums are amazing
But I truly had the impresion of being in like a resort or disney landia
As if nobody really lived there
Just tourists, kebaps and italian and argentinian restaurants
Made in a factory and comfortably freezed so that everybody gets their shitty "Spanish food" in 5 minutes
It's truly insane
Cities like Madrid or Seville do a much better job with turism (in my opinion)
I really hate what barcelona has become
Such a great city, ruined by tourism (in my opinion)
It's even stressfull
I think if it wasn't full of tourists, kiosks, street vendors and what not it would be quite a nice boulevard, and I guess that's the appeal
It used to have appeal
Now unfortunately it's a shithole
Everywhere in Barcelona tbh
When i still worked there there were some articles in foreign media advising caution in barcelona (there's kind of okupation problem and pickpocketing) and the catalan government went nuts over it
But it's fucking true
That kind of behaviour is not that weird
Spain is fairly racist against romanian gypsies and parentless moroccan kids (the two groups mostly associated with the pickpocketing thing) so nobody cares if the police tackle or hit them a bit
I saw once a police officer straight up hitting with his stick in the chest and in the knee a moroccan 15 yo that was running with a stolen bag
That's something most people don't know about Spain
Our police will hit (a bit) you if you missbehave (nudism in near the beach, being extra drunk and doing shit, stealing, etc)
I saw it several times in Barcelona to mostly american tourists
Yeah that region arrou d there is the only semi-arid region in europe
Heat can get pretty brutal
If you are asking for barcelona There're very few spots that haven't been taken over by tmass tourism but I'd reccomend mounnt tibidabo
It's not that popular and the view is amazing
A if you have the time, the Abey of Montserrat is great too, a different taste of catalonia
&#x200B;
If you are asking Spain in general, the entire northern coast of Cantabria and Asturias are breathtakingly beautiful (and the food might be the best in Spain)
That's the good thing, if they try they can make it good too,they just need to Want to do it good
I'm ashamed
I went there and I left as fast as I could because of the tourists
I will definitely return to see that, thanks
Probably, yeah
Mostly centrum
The furthest i went was the naval museum
Yep, just don't go where you see only tourists eating and I guarantee you it will be good food (probably they won't sell paella there, but for other reasons)
I've lived in 3 spanish cities: Bilbao, Barcelona and now Madrid
Bilbao is tiny and tourism very seasonal but i must say that between Barcelona and Madrid I find Madrid much more authentic and comfortable to vissit
Except for like the most centric part, madrid manages it much better imo
Even the "touristy" parts are filled with Madrid locals on a sunday morning just having some beers
You know what I mean
Barcelona's summer heat is literally the worst in Spain
so fuccking humid
I preffer teh drier heat you get in the interior
I'M FROM RONDA AND THAT PLACE IS 100m FROM MY HOME SO I LOVE YOU <3 (And to answer your comment, I'd say that having a good nose for bad restaurants/bars is common between Spaniards, given that a lot of our social life happens there)
Meant tiny just compared to Barcelona and Madrid haha
Es que el mejor pueblo de la tierra <3 vuelve cuando quieras jajajaja
I'm a bad Spaniard
I don't like village festivals, I don't like a beer after work, I hate jamón serrano, of course I don't sleep siesta and my skin is very white, even in summer
I should be expelled from the country just because of the ham
I like to have a long siesta after lunch when I can (weekends and holidays)
When I was younger I partied all the weekend nights, but nowadays I prefer a good dinner and a film on TV
I don't like to party, football or beer and wine
I don't like flamenco, feria or places with a lot of people and noise
And siesta is something that I do from time to time when really needed but I hate that if it gets out of control, I get up feeling like shit
But I really like tapas and going to bars
I'm very fond of the Spanish cuisine and the laid back culture
I really don't know more Spanish stereotypes
I am spanish but cannot eat la tortilla española because i am allergic to eggs
I'm a vegetarian (so I don't eat jamón), I hate parties at discos, I hate reggeaton (it gives me migraines xd), I don't scream when I talk and I hate that others do, I don't enjoy the sun in summer (but I love it when the temperature is low enough for human beings to exist), I've always found seafood disgusting
I don't like drinking alcohol and I'll never do cocaine
I'm moving to Germany, I hope I fit in better, tbh
I am bad at being Spanish
I haven't met people in a couple weeks, last week I went to visit a castle and this week I went to the mountains to ski, all alone
I dont like football
I play guitar, but I like death metal
I am alergic to the shrimps so I cannot eat paella and most important, I deeply hate toros
My friends (Yes I have friends) call me the swede
I do Siesta
I'm not a loud person though, and also pretty chill compared to the stereotype
I love jamón serrano, I love to take siestas, I use like half a liter of olive oil a week and I talk loud and fast
I also lover partying hard, but now I don't feel like it
does you mom/gf have a mustache tho
otherwise you might be on our side of the border
Everything you described (minus the oh la la
) applies to Spain too
Tell me at least that you put onion in your tortilla
I'm offended
Sir, give me your DNI and exit the country please
Yes you should
I am short, barely 155cm, so I was always the short one everywhere
However I am blonde, got blue eyes and pale skin (to the point of having family history of skin cancer, I have no idea how my ancestors survived) anyway my face is very pan European but my height gives me away all the time
I also looooove bread, Spanish bread is the best
Andestá er Beti
You made me laugh, thank you
I feel you, my friends call me "the german" for the same reasons, it is not an insult, it's just because I'm don't have much problem staying at home
I also think in germans drinking beer, watching football matches and having party but, whatever
I don't care, I like both
But I want the tortilla to be very well-cooked, if I see a thread of raw egg I'm out
We don't know, he's under investigation
Hey, don't do that
You've given him the option of repeating his words, and I'm not sure I can survive it
Look what you've done
you'll have [to find me] first
Yes, it was fun when I was a kid
Now you can't convince me to go to a village festival, not even for all the sweet fair wine in the world
The crowds, the plastic chairs, drunks, the whistling of fairground rides, the amateur orchestras singing tacky songs
I get tired just thinking about it
I know that
They call me the swede usually when I come from the silence with a solution for something
Or when I massively complain about the inneficiency and byzantinism of the Spanish systems, which is often
Usually the job-related things, such as holidays or work schedule
I'm calling the police
You were not kidding, that might be the least Spanish response possible
Some childhood trauma is the most likely hypothesis
I  d o n t  l i k e  j a m ó n, serrano, iberico, fed on acorns or squirrel droppings
It smells bad and the texture is disgusting
(─‿‿─)
Well, if you've ever experienced the way things work outside Iberia, then seeing the systems here really makes your blood boil sometimes
Plenty to complain about
But honestly, 'German/Swedish acting' Spaniards are common enough that it's a recognizable reason for that nickname
Im right behind you
I don't know
one time my downstairs neighbor called the police on us for a noise complaint
It was just my roommate and I sitting at home watching TV
I'm still mystified at that
This is clearly a more serious offence
If you bake cakes that aren't totally dry there are "raw egg" juices, if you make scrambled eggs that aren't solid rubber there are "raw egg" juices
Tortilla, in Spain, means omelette
Flour doughs are often called tortas
[Tortilla española or potato omelette]
[Undercooked tortilla española]
I think it is easy to choose
I'm just joking ;) if you don't like it, you don't like it
Don't worry, I'm not going to lecture you about it, I'm sure you're fed up of that
I know how things work outside
There are things that work and things that not
I realised that it is not the problems you have, it is how you solve them
The huge problem and it is a problem that we share for example with Italy is that people does not feel linked to the system, so just ' I do my thing and the remaining is other's problem'.
I'm saying goodbye to my family
probably british
Be careful, my grandmother had problems with the neighbours over the noise and it ended with her """accidentally""" scraping their car
Yeah, my grandmother was notified of a petty crime at age 73
I'm glad you survived xD
Ohohoho
Right on the head of what I find one of the most depressing traits of Spain indeed
I spent a lot of my youth in other countries, so it's depressing when among my friends in Spain I see them leaving trash in public spaces, or doing things that might cause problems for others (or simply not be good for the community) just because whatever it is won't affect them personally
And then going to another country and see my friends there instead pick up trash others have left in parks since their mentality is that everyone should try to help out when possible
Imho this is caused by one simple fact
Spanish people does not feel that their decision may change the system
This means, you are not even owner of your house, no decision power on how things are going
Only a grain in the 47 million dessert
A couple years ago I linked a study on attitudes between countries that got a lot of upvotes in this sub
One of the most distinctive questions was: do you feel like your outcome in life is under your control
And yeah, Spain was right there near one extreme whilst the US was on the other
This is set in "Spain", so we are gathering all the Mexicans around Los Angeles and make a happy crowd
Best examples of cringe:
\- Vantage point
\- Mission impossible 2
They burn saints, in a delirious mix of Fallas and Seville's Holly Week
\- Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
In american movies they seem to think that Mexico would represent us well enough
Any movie placed in Spain is from a Mexico set
Some examples:
-Completely disregarding Spanish traditions or assuming that everywhere is the same (there's lots of diverdity in Spain in languages, nature and traditions) such as flamenco dancers all over Barcelona and everybody being a gypsy dancer
Also, we don't burn our Saints (mixing fallas and procesiones)
Also confusing Spanish regional dances with the Argentinian tango or even mariachis
- People speaking a south american accent
- People with native american features, we have immigration but you can't assume we all look like native americans
- Everybody eats paella, all the time
- People wearing traditional dresses in everyday life
- All men are "macho men".
- we don't have mountains or woods, everything takes place in a desert or a very dry place
Some shows/movies with very wrong representations: McGuiver, How I met you mother, Mission Impossible, night and day, family guy
"Spanish" police in an american TV show clearly being latinos and with a thick chicano/mexican accent
Or any movie about colonization where spaniards are 99% of the time greedy brutes, while of course the other colonizers are brave and honorable often times, and rarely portrayed in such manner
>*Spaniards who came to the* New World *seeking opportunities beyond the prospects of their European  environment, are contemptuously called cruel and greedy "goldseekers,"  or other opprobrious epithets virtually synonymous with "Devils"; but  Englishmen who sought New World opportunities are more respectfully  called "colonists," or "homebuilders," or "seekers after liberty
" \[...\]  When Spaniards expelled or punished religious dissidents, this came to  be known as "bigotry," "intolerance," "fanaticism," and a cause of their  decline
When Englishmen, Dutchmen, or Frenchmen did the same thing, it  is known as "unifying the nation," or safeguarding it against treason  or foreign conspiracy
>\-*Tree of Hate* (2008 edition), page 11
>Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
When i Saw the bananas i lost It
It's awfull
Legendary McGyver episode
As Spain is in South America, North of Spain is North of the Amazonian rainforest, OBVIOUSLY:
> - Macgyver's episode when they fly to "Barcelona airport", just landing strip in the middle of the jungle, to meet the "Basque terrorists" who live surrounded by bananas
Came looking for this
Absolute legend
I'm always amazed that USAns cry racism/cultural appropriation before you can open your mouth while assassinating other cultures like this with no repercussions
I need to see this
It's hilarious
We need to fund this movie
Well, you have highlander :)
>how I met your mother
They got so many things wrong in very few seconds for Spain
The cities names AND their locations on the map are wrong, and of course, Mexican mariachis and argentinian tango in Spain, because, why not
>Eurotrip
Good lord, that's terrible and absolutely hilarious
I need to see it
does Spain get the same American cliché treatment
I tell you they do better
According to mcguiver Spain IS in southamerica and the basques live among banana plantations, plotting their Next assault against Barcelona
We also dance tango and listen to mariachis
Let me translate:  the US is in africa, independentist texans live in the jungle plotting their next assault against Alabama
They also dance irish jigs and listen to reggae
I see your point
And there's a lack of representation
However there's been improvement, i'm seeing more and more shows that feature catalan
And there's also another reality that you're not talking about
Almost everyone in Spain talks spanish
a while ago i made the argument that the second language most spoken in Spain IS spanish
And though it would be amazing if we had more catalan, basque or galician in our movies, i would LOVE It at least, the truth IS that most movies even when they take place in different regions Will stick with one language
Think of english movies, which choose to subtitle
Very few
If language doesn't play an integral part of the story you can still tell the story changing the language
Or do you watch every movie produced in europe in their original language
Sincerely, It seems you're just trying to push an idea instead of answering the op's question
What you tell is still interesting and i believe people will enjoy It, but IS that the worst representation you can think of, Barcelona appears in looooots of films and as far as i know few do them Justice
Really, the worst
Check how i met your mother, or macguiver, where basque terrorist plan an attack on Barcelona amidst a humid jungle full of banana plantations
> the conflict happens within people that actually speak different language
Txato is allegedly euskaldun
Gorka is a renowned writer in euskera
These things are an important part of the message of the book that you seem that you have missed
lmao, how is this real
At least they used something like the real thing instead of a small church in the Mexican desert or a mosque in Morocco
not a bad idea at all hehe
Offend two countries at the price of one
never seen it
> It seems you're just trying to push an idea instead of answering the op's question
99% of this guy's comments
Exactly
See
You no longer are jealous of the Irish, you do have shitty shows that "take place in your country"
God, I couldn't finish the first season
I doubt the average american would watch the sketch and say "Ted is so ignorant, haha"
>"Ocho apellidos vascos" (Eight Basque surnames) and then "Ocho apellidos catalanes" (Eight Catalan surnames)
These were welcome by most Spaniards, but for those of us that are in the territories they're depicting, it's the most cringe thing to watch; it's literally a tourist approach, but within your own country
That's a parody
Everyone knows It
It's supposed to be cringy that's the fun of It
It's just like an italian in Norway or welcome to the sticks
It's very different when in a SERIOUS movie they do a horrible job at portraying the country
Yeah, i just saw him on Sports to add in the olympics
Of course he HAD TO complain here's his cry: Spain didn't let Catalonia compete with it's own national team
WhAT An INjuStICe
Well you said "the most unreal representations" are from within the country
>I never said it's the worst representation,
> I just was saying that representation within the same country is already bad enough
I Really didn't read that
You know unreal to worst isn't really that Big of a leap in this case
>Now, what's a show that features Catalan or Basque, if I may ask
You say there're improvements, but I see none
>I hope you don't mean that Barcelona based production show that was bilingual and wasn't even aired, just put online by the public TV
(Then TV3 did air it, ironically enough, and it was of course not well received
I already told you merli, which was a hit
I STILL have to ask my mother about her policiaca
I agree there's still very little and i get what no representation can feel like
My bad, I meant Outlander
But highlander is pretty cool
I can't tell you of any movie but my mother IS watching a couple of shows
I can ask her
I don't watch It because policiacas aren't my stuff
But merli for example was a hit, and i for one watched It in catalan
>Sure, that's what I said
You conveniently threw out of your quote how I said they were comedies
Yeah, i also missed out the part where you say the concept itself IS horrible
I didn't conveniently left out anything I started with the name of the movie to be clear about it
Two of my best friend's are Andalucian and basque and they enjoyed the movie
the second one was quite hard to swallow i'll give you that
>This kind of treatment could even be argued as anticonstitutional, as it directly goes against the 3rd Article
How
I'm not gonna lie  i didn't read the full article but i didn't se anything about It
I did see that "amor a la patria" IS listed among the things to be taught
which i must say IS a tad terrifying
>I'm not saying that there aren't shows in Catalan, like Merlí, I'm saying that there're no shows, nor movies, nor tv news in Castillian and aimed at the broadest audiences that show with a reasonable regularity someone speaking another language, with the proper subtitles
Catalan, gallician and basque are all very localised languages in spain
I get that from Catalonia you might not get that idea
I think It happens In part because when people move away they tend to talk the local language
in my day to day Life i Hear no catalan, basque or gallician, despite there being lots of them in Madrid
The other way around It also works
There was a huge wave of migrants from Andalucia to Catalonia, But they now Talk catalan
It would be absurd to ask for a catalan show with Andalucian dialects
I'm telling you: the reasonable regularity here is 0
It's waaaay more uncommon heating catalan than english
>In 80 years of Spanish tv, this hasn't happened, so it's been 80 years where people in Spain from monolingual territories can only see in the screen people speaking their language
We're erased from the collective imaginary, and as a result we're perceived as exotic, when we're citizens like everyone else
40 of which have been under the dictatorship
and you're not erased from the collective imaginary, your language IS
It's a shitty thing, i'm not gonna lie
However Catalonia doesn't receive the same treatment
There's plenty of influence from Catalonia in the rest of Spain
From your people to your products, to everything
If you, a catalan feel forgotten Imagine an extremeño.
>Forty fucking years of public TV post dictatorship, and I still have to see RTVE interview someone in the streets speaking a language other than Castillian and putting up subs
Language IS a communication device
If someone asked me in english through the streets i would answer in english
RTVE IS Broadcasted all over Spain, the main issue IS not showing an indentity but convey information
That a confabulation of Spain, Portugal, the Italian Republics, France, England and the Netherlands somehow joined forces to rob Catalonia of its history and literature
According to the Institut Nova Història (New History Institute), the following characters were Catalan: Erasmus, Leonardo, Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, Hernán Cortés, Iheronymus Bosch, Cervantes, Magellan, Montaigne, Raffael, Pizarro, Gerolamo Cardano, and a long etcetera
I would love a movie about this
"Hey, nice to meet you, and I'm sorry for the loss
BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ANCIENT GREAT EMPIRE THAT GOT BORED AND
Don't forget the Titanosaurus, a catalonian dinosaur
Dont forget that they said Artur Mas(ex president of the autonomus comunnity of catalonia) was a direct descendant of leonardo da vinci
Same reason why aliens in Hollywood movies always attack the US
And many more
Just check their website and have fun
inh
cat
Oh, so Mas is descended from pedophiles in addition to slave traders
Sounds plausible given his actions ngl
ɑ. I tried for some time writting it like "a", but i didn't liked the results
I do write "r" though, I didn't like the one we are taught in school
I've used both, now I use the first one more often
"α" is more common in Spain, probably because it's usually easier to write it nicely
I write "a", but I'm the only one that I know who does it :(
My best friend does, and both my brothers too
Yes, same in Spain
Maybe some boys did but it was definitely considered "girlish", as also writing very perfectly round letters
Every time portugal doesn't give us enough points in eurovision there are public callings about either naval and land blockade or straight out total war (if it's just 1 point)
We often joke about conquering portugal and gibraltar
Yes, although is not a joke, GIBRALTAR ESPAÑOL
(Just kidding I don't care about a small piece of land)
Maybe it’s just my friends and I but specially during Eurovision times we joke about starting new invasions, specially towards Portugal, but also France and the UK (give us Gibraltar ffs)
Dont forget gibraltar
I'm pretty sure you already own magaluf lol
Germans literally had access to Mallorca before some Spaniards, it's already yours guys
You know that's so well known we even joke with that in Spain Mallorca the 17th lander
Olivenza's case went to the point that there is no sign of entering Portugal (on the Portuguese side ofc) from the bridge connecting Olivenza and Elvas
And a "espanhois filhos da puta, Olivença é nossa" behind Spain's sign
Nobody in Spain cares about keeping Olivenza though, most people don't even remember that Menorca was British for some time for example, apart from Catalanist Menorquins
Gibraltar though is another matter
Oh boy
> Olivença
Olivenza, carajo
Oh, yeah
Fuck scandinavia in eurovision hahaha
Probably
but they have a weird obsession over a tiny village called olivenza
Many people care about it
Tbh i like it for the memes and because of the geopolitics of the points
France and the netherlands talking about dividing belgium
where have i Heard this before
Most of the people Who live there are British, but the people Who work there are all Spanish, as far as i know
I have a good friend from La Línea de la Concepción (The neighboring spanish town) and he worked there
Well, we "inherited" It
with the army and fleet just outside lisbon
We make a deal, you guys help us retake Gibraltar and we give you a couple of islands with a lot of 1€ cold beers
Nice to know
Can you take west Midlands too
I have friends there and I don't want them to be in the bad part of the borders
And modest hahaha
If you aid us retaking Gibraltar we'll let you take Olivenza
So Portugal gets Olivenza, Spain Gibraltar, the UK Ceuta, Morocco Melilla, denmark skane, sweeden Åland, finland viborg and russia
lets say they have taken enough
I see it
Actually I see that fair lol
I don't make the rules dude
Right now it's mentioned, not as main story but high enough, just below Verstappen victory
The article is mainly informative and mentions that the results are not in line with foreign media polls
In terms of the general population, I doubt many will discuss it among friends or family, or even click in the articles
It's not a known topic and there are many other things going on
I watched a video on it in Youtube but I haven't heard anything about it in the news
In Spain it isnt being treated as a very important news, but the main national media dedicate a space to it and the headline of all of them can be summarized in "the last dictatorship in Europe" (I think they forget about one or two others at least, but okay
I was trying to follow it and was very pissed i couldn't. They write briefly about it, show some videos of the protest, but present it just as pissed people angry because they lost the elections, they explain no shit, don't give the background story, nothing
But many people in Spain can't even place Belarus in the map, so
-\_-
I read the El Mundo article and they gave a bit of explanation about it
Mentioned the irregularities and that the results might be rigged
But as you say, quite superficially
I just watched the tv news and FINALLY, they explained it way better
How spread out everything is
You need a car for everything it seems, the "automotive city" urban design really forces it on you
Even in the american bases they would make in Spain they would build everything spread out and you'd have the supermarket in one corner, the houses in another
forcing you to use the car pretty much
I get the heebie jeebies whenever I see a movie where American kids recite the pledge of allegiance
It reminds me to the Spanish kids during Franco's Dictatorship singing the Cara al Sol before class
This:
\- Where are you from
\- I'm from Spain
\- Really
I have a friend in Italy
The fact that tax isn't seen in the prices, the education system and the imperial system
Kinder egg
WHY
If you are gonna drive and have a gun you better not be drunk I guess
This
I've heard so many praises about the American service
During my visits I've always felt they just wanted my tip and nothing else
I've seen genuine kindness in service everywhere I've been, but in the US it always felt fake an uncomfortable
Tipping is a terrible idea
Start demanding proper salaries for your fellow citizens and stop this bs
This has probably more to do with climate
Cold/rainy countries mean you really have to leave your shoes when you enter or your house will need a LOT more cleaning
In warmer/dry countries your shoes do bring some dirt in, but since your windows will be open 24/7, it doesn't really make a difference
Here, taking off your shoes is a matter of comfort rather than hygiene
In my state (South Carolina) I had to pay a small fee and pass a written test in order to get my permit
With a permit I could only drive in daylight hours with an adult next to me, never alone
You have your permit for a minimum of six months, during which time you have to take an informational course (for me it was all day, like 8am-4pm)
Then I had to have behind-the-wheel practice with the instructor
I don’t remember how many hours it was but I remember going four or five times and driving with him for basically the afternoon during each time
Then, once your six months is past, you can take another written test and then a behind-the-wheel test
If you pass you get your license
If you don’t, you have to stick with your permit I think for another six months but I can’t remember
I passed mine the first time
American here, it used to be more expensive
It also really depends where you are
I’m from a rural state and there was a big farm of like gasoline tanks (?) (i don’t know what they are called) and apparently that tank farm was linked directly with a major port where crude oil was brought in
So for us it was always cheaper than the average
When i was in high school (late 2000s-early 2010s) I remember hearing about gas being as much as 5-6 USD in bigger cities in the north and I thought that was crazy
For us the highest it ever got was about 3
75 I guess
Since I moved abroad I’ve heard that it has gotten insanely cheap and whenever I go back it’s almost always under 2
From what I’ve read this has been due to the US finding its own oil using fracking instead of importing it
It’s insanely cheap now from what I hear, about 1
18 in my area
As an American living in Spain I think it came out from good intentions
you also hear about the probably-racist American who hears Spanish and assumes that they are Mexican, which reflects his perception that all Spanish-speaking countries are just other Mexicos with different names but the same culture
Stupid Americans come to Spain all the time are are disappointed when they don’t find spicy foods and tacos
Two different cultures entirely
So when immigrants come from other countries I think it makes sense that they would want to specify what kind of culture they come from
A lot of Spanish people will see an Asian person and just assume they come from China and call them “chinos”, but will also get really annoyed when people come up to them and put a Mexican sombrero on them, ask them about día de los muertos, and tell them and their favorite food is the quesadilla
Usually the people that are more specific about “Race” tend to be more educated about different cultures, at least in the states
That’s one thing I wish existed a bit more here
Yes, we do
* 1 day of paid leave for moving
* 15 days for getting married
* 2 days for the death, accident or illness of your spouse or of a parent, child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild of yours or of your spouse
This gets extended to 4 days if travel is required
Aside from this, we also have maternity and paternity leave of course
16 weeks for each parent
And there’s medical leave, which is regulated differently
This is the basic number of days that everyone’s entitled to by law
If a sector/company has its own bargaining agreements they can extend these paid leaves, but never reduce them
Here in Spain you get 1 day when you move house, and 2 freaking weeks if you get married
What is amazing for me is the sick leave when you have a sick child here in slovakia
Pure porn guys
In Spain we have 17 different public health systems to manage blood donations (plus other independent ones like the Red Cross), so I don't know if any of them gives you a day off, but in sure getting paid for any kind of donation is strictly forbidden
Is it common to get 50th birthday off and paid
My [Finnish] company does that
Funnily enough they also list Friday pulla (sweet cardamom buns for those of you who don't know) as a benefit
Wow interesting
Great parental leave and allowance to take care of your child
15 days when getting married in Spain :)
> I hope that's common in Europe
Paid
The first 3 days are unpaid by default in Spain
Yes, exactly, I think that’s the point of it
It’s meant to cover the honeymoon
I never realized it was unusual for other countries before
Crazy because it's a desperate measure to increase natality
Yes, it makes sense
I think that the reason behind this 15-day leave is actually the honeymoon
For some couples, it can be a struggle to coordinate with both of their companies so that they get the exact same week/weeks off, particularly in the summer
This is actually a recurring issue in many workplaces each summer
I'm afraid to ask,
I prefer the pulla tbh
Do you think so
It never occurred to me that that could be reason behind it
If that’s so, I’m not sure it makes a lot of sense
That's great
Yeah, i don't know how people are supposed to have kids when they are expected to go back to work just after, and then pay crazy amounts for childcare
I know some do it by choice, but it's nice to live in a country where you have the option to stay and take care of your children as well
My mother has gone to work sick and she is a school teacher (recently retired)
[This web has a nice summary in Spanish]
* First 3 days: 0 €.
* From 4th to 15th days: 60% salary paid by the employer
* From the 16th to the 20th: 60% salary paid by the Social Security
* From 21st:  75% salary paid by the Social Security
However this is not universal, I am a software engineer and my employer pays sick days since the first day
But, retail/hospitality workers gets the legal minimum if they are lucky, because many work partially/totally in cash and that doesn't get paid when you are sick
It's the first 3 days of an official medical leave
The thing is that you usually don't request a medical leave if you are going to miss three days or less, it's usually enough with a doctor's note (and you get paid time-off)
I'm not really sure of why it's like that, but it's like paying a "bureaucracy tax".
I learnt this the hard way the first time I got the flu on my first full time job
I woke up sick on a Thursday and I asked for a medical leave, so I lost thee days salary (including the Saturday, which I wasn't going to work anyway)
It would have been enough with a doctor's note for the Thursday and Friday, and I would had got the full salary
Edit: as a clarification: while you are in "medical leave", you get paid by Social Security (who "takes" the first three days), but if you have a doctor's note you are still paid by your employer
>find a job in Spain
You will have trouble with that one
I don't think there are many secrets left in Spain, but Asturias is an absolutely gorgeus place not so visited by foreigners
Outsanding nature, cheap and wonderful food and cider
And as you asked for a city, Oviedo is a place I really like
Other small city not very visited by tourists that I love are Cáceres and Cuenca
I think Toledo, Ávila and Segovia receive a lot of tourists fron Madrid, but I love those too
In Spain there are many gems hidden from tourists, but if I had to choose only one I would say the Cíes Islands
Luckily it's well preserved and not a shame like some tourist-oriented places in the mainland coast, full of english pubs where there's always someone puking or completely wasted on the street
This is very specific but the Jewry of Seville
very very beautiful and if you go with a sevillian that knows a little history (like me) it’s even better
One of my favorite parts of Seville honestly
The name of that city sounds kind of triste
It was winter so maybe I'm wrong about it, but I was positively surprised by Lucca, I found the city really cool and it didn't had any tourist when I went during the winter, in the other hand Firenze was still a nightmare, and Pisa was
Pisa
Probably during the summer it's not the same experience
In Spain our secrets are not cities, but our rural areas and natural reserves, foreign people here only travels to places that are very accesible and close to a big city
My recent favourite is Huesca, the region is full of medieval towns and the natural parks there are gorgeous, but only Spaniards visit them
The thing about the North of Spain is that it isn't what people typically think of when they think Spain
It really is just like seattle or Vancouver: Green, rainy, Rocky shores etc
Ayyy i live in Oviedo :)
Yup, it's a toss up between Gijon and Oviedo
Yesss and I think a lot of places from the north-west part of Spain are hidden to tourism in general
But hey, it's not worth it, better go to south (?
So beautiful they even made a series based there
It’s also a hidden gem, it’s called The Office
Huesca IS just amazing
I know, most tourists come to Spain because of the weather, and the North is not very sunny to be honest
Lucky man, I love your city
Basque Country is such a unique and wonderful place, both to visit and to live
I've only been once though, but I want to come back as soon as possible
I've never been to the south
I live in Asturias so I know a lot about these "hidden gems" of the north
Any place you would totally recommend in the south
People in these areas might not speak English, but to be honest it doesn't matter, specially nowadays with smartphones: google maps, translator apps, etc
it's not difficult to travel without speaking the language, you always find a way
I've been to a lot of places with strong language barriers (hello China), I recommend to have 3-4 translator apps downloaded with all the available offline content, also an offline maps app like maps
me (you can use your phone gps without mobile data for free)
Also a list with names of places and key words it's also cool to have, and that's it
Córdoba without a doubt
The old center and the mosque are really worth it
It's fascinating the mix of cultures you can appreciate there, and to get lost in the old narrow streets
It's better to go in spring with all the flowers blooming, but you'll see yourself surounded by tons of tourists
Also Sevilla, in my opinion is popular for a reason, big but pretty and full of wonderful people and great green areas
You also have the coast, but I haven't been there that much
In Spanish we have the word “embarazada” which means “to be pregnant
” If you’re an English or Italian (imbarazzata/o) speaker, you’d maybe think it means “to be embarrassed,” but you’d be totally wrong to think that,
The first word that comes to my mind is "constipado", which means the cold or the verb "constipar", to have a cold
Many times I saw in UK spanish people sick, because we weren't used to british weather in winter, and they stated without hesitation "I'm constipated today
" while they blew their noses and sneezed
Actual
In English means "real" in spanish means "current" (current time, not something like a water current) The pronunciation is different, in Spanish the last syllabe is the stressed one
Exit - Éxito (success)
Exit is translated as salida, to exit = salir
Carpet - carpeta (folder) a carpet is an "alfombra"
Being Constipated - estar constipado well, in spanish means you catch a cold
Constipated is translated as "estreñido"
In spanish, "constipado" and constipated have completely different meanings
Constipado is to have a cold
Constipated is to be estreñido
Propina in Spanish means tip but in Portuguese it means bribe
I find it very funny because it seems like you are calling a bribe a "tip" ironically
Spanish embarazada/o and English embarrassed
Embarazada means pregnant in Spanish while in English embarassed means, you know, embarassed
Exprimir in Spanish means to squeeze, but in French, exprimer it means to explain
Caca un Spanish is poop too
Japanese is thought to be an isolated language coming from somewhere in Siberia so wouldn't surprise me if they are very far related, like Indo-European languages are
Also, "molestar" means to bother someone, but "to molest someone"...well prepare to be 10 years in prison
Edit: more than one has said innocently that X was molesting Y in a casual tone and received a mortified stare in exchange before realising the mistake
Also carpeta and carpet
In Spanish "banco" is also a bank and a bench
Can confirm most of us thinks "footing" means jogging
aceite (oil) in spanish comes from the hispanic-arab azzáyt, which comes from the clasic arab azzayt
Many words in spanish come from arab, I wonder if those similar italian words (like aceto) have the same origin
I guess this counts
I live in Spain, and for most people spanish is associated with Spain altough Mexico is much bigger and spanish is spoken in almost all Latin America
In the US is associated with Mexico instead
We don't feel overwhelmed at all by the news related to them, and I guess they are not overwhelmed with our news either
It is obvious that we are closer and maybe we get a bit more information in news about Cuba's situation, Venezuelas crisis, Chile's revolution or Colombia's demonstrations against police violence
I don't know how informed they keep about what happens in Spain though
When it comes to internet, this is what I have realized: In youtube there is a clear majority of Latin American content, but when you google something you will most likely find information associated to Spain
For example, if you google what the steps to create a company are, most information showing up will be from Spain
You look for travel recomendations to X country, you will fin the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Spain
Sometimes, when I try to look for a information of a specific Latin American country it is hard to get the information from that specific country you want
Not when I lived in Spain, as Google is quite good at filtering news from your country
But now that I live in the UK Google is not sure when I ask in Spanish if I want something from LatinAmerica or Brazil, rarely I get info from Spain
That's really weird, I've never come across that problem with Spanish
I always get Spain-related stuff, never Latin American
Funnily latin americans seem to have the sterotype that Spain is full of youtubers because apparently they're too dominant, and indeed almost all spanish-language youtubers I know are spanish
Greece
An island if I could choose
Germany, I visited the Southwest of the country and fell in love
I guess I'd love the south of Poland and France or Switzerland as well
Italy or Greece, or possibly Portugal
I wouldn't stand living in nordic countries or central Europe
Definitely Germany, the salaries are great and public services are also pretty good
I don't really agree with how the government is dealing with the climate crisis but I for living it's a no brainer
Netherlands  or Norway
Both are great economies, with interesting cultures and awesome life quality
I'd miss Spanish weather, but I prefer high quality life standards than sunny weather
No matter how broken Italy is it's still my first option
If I had to pick a nearby place that's the Basque Country for sure, what an amazing language
Plus the scenery and food
Otherwise I'd say the Nordic countries because I personally love some aspects of their way of living and doing things, along with language itself
With a place like Mauritius, you have to consider the isolation
I've lived a bit in Hawaii, a place that many consider paradise, and while it is a pretty idyllic place, once the vacation mode wears off, life is the same as anywhere else
Palm trees and beaches won't pay your bills or fill the holes in your life, and now you're stuck on a tiny rock, with very fixed geographical limits many hours and hundreds of € away from anything else
I suppose it's easy to take the connective-ness of everything in Europe for granted, it's a hard thing to realize until you don't have it
Maybe it's just a personal preference - It's definitely right for some people, but it's also something that many overlook when considering places like this
Same
You're getting one way ticket to Siberia

I read this in an italian accent
While throwing my hands up of course
jaja te entiendo
estaba intentando de pensar en una frase más completa que pudieras decir en palabras que terminen en o que sean similares a las del inglés pero no pude
Ni puta idea de lo que me estáis contando
Spaniard here (F30 at the time)
English teacher for context
Once on holidays in Manchester, a couple of guys sitting nearby started talking about my boobs and ass,assuming that given my (very stereotypical) Spanish looks, I’d just be an ignorant tourist with no clue of the language spoken in the area
Poor dumbasses
I listened and when their girlfriends came back from wherever they had been, I approached the table and explained the whole situation to them
Their faces were priceless
Epic moment,
Loved Manchester tho
I have been mistaken for a Brit 3 times this year
In my own fucking country
Yeah, that has happened to me too while playing 5v5 games
People that speak anything that isn't English tend to asume that the rest of the players can't understand them
Yes, I am
They told me I looked British
Is the Spanish deck of cards known at all in other countries
Whenever I see people playing cards in foreign media its always the [French deck]
I was wondering if people outside Spain known at all the [Spanish deck] or if its something inherently Spanish that nobody else really knows- [Example of how the cards look]
Or if you know other decks besides the French deck, wich one is it
I think they are known to Spain only, I am from the city that makes them so obviously I know them quite well
Not trying to advertise someone's product, but during lockdown my friends have been virtually playing with them in the game Tabletop Simulator and we have had drinking and playing virtual meetings :)
In Spain we call those games brisca, tresillo, and escoba
We play plenty of brisca and escoba here too :))
I guess it comes from the time when the Philippines was a Spanish colony
>Spanish cards: used in the centre (except Tuscany) and in the south, they are basically the same of Spanish cards
(Here the ones used in Naples)
Apparently this design comes from the now extinct "Madrid design" of the Spanish deck
This is the most common in Spain nowadays:  [
Only 3 jacks
Thats a weird ass deck
Never heard of  l'hombre, how do you play it
Cleaves or batons
Venetian Republic intensifies
Like the Italian, Spanish decks usually have 40 cards: 1-7 and 3 characters per colour
There're decks of 52 to play some games but that's pretty recent, normally we use the french deck for those
Edit: Decks of 48 are common in some regions, they include 8 and 9s.
Aren't there numbers in the corners for that
When you buy them they include 8s and 9s because they can be used for some games but they're generally taken out (and often lost or thrown away)
Check the pdf catalog, decks of 40 cards are the most common format
8 and 9s are only common in catalan decks
I don't even know if young people play cards anymore but what I can assure you is that up north french decks are a very common household item, french games like rabino are pretty popular
I think french and spanish cards are of the same size and material or at least mine are identical
In Spain you have to do some basic tests every 10 years
Sight, eye-hand coordination and such
I mean, theoretically here in Spain you have to renew your driving license every 10 years and every 5 once you're older than 65, but virtually everyone passes those tests
In Spain elderly people have to renew their license every year by doing some tests about their vision and reflexes
However, even if they look potential dangerous, there are not evidences that they are the main risk on the road
Drunk and people watching their phones are more dangerous
I went and check for the UK, and the BBC says that [young drivers (17-24) have 4 times more accident than drivers over 70]
I'll start wearing a jacket at 20ºC, below 15-10ºC I'll change to a thicker and better jacket
Under 5ºC I'll start promising myself that this year I'll buy some gloves and a hat but I never do it
At 0ºC or below that I'll use various layers of clothes because my jacket was not designed for that and I'll complain about the cold every 5min until reaching a building
Below 8 is jacket time
Around 0 is: _is this real
I’m from Almeria
In London my preference is the same haha
In summer, below 25-27ºC or something like that (I live in the south), in winter maybe 10-12ºC
like 10-15°C. That's "damn I should have brought a jacket". +1 if it's windy, that shit gets to my bones
- 5-10 ºC: cold-ish, I'll wear a light jacket
- 0-5 ºC: cold, wear a good jacket, gloves, a neck warmer
- <0 ºC: f****ng cold, wear the same, maybe with better gloves and a sweater inside (and I'll still be cold everywhere else in my body, anyway)
I was going to write mine
but it's pretty much the same
Same here, was wearing my fleece at home the other day and it was only like 17°
Same, i would be comfy in an oven
Where are you from, Im from Castille and thought ive always handled cold good, like yes maybe around 15°-10° I'll get a sweeter if its 0°-5° maybe a jacket too I still remember a weeding, we were in my hometown Soria, already night it was chilly but we all wore no jacket or sweater just with the weeding shirt and some guys who came to the weeding i don't know if from Valencia or Andalucía were freaking freazing, i won't forget me casully wearing my shirt while looking at a ldy with a pelt coat trying his best not to frooze
I'm from Barcelona, so yeah for me going below 20ºC is already a nighmare hahaha
I frequent a lot the Pyrenees as I have family there and for me it's an instakill when going on winter
A friend of mine from Cantabria now is living there, came to Burgos with me to spend the weekend and the sucker was all fucking day complaining how cold he was
hahaha once you get used to it, it's difficult to go back
I can't handle heat, everytime i go to Madrid to visit friends or family in the city its just slighty warm maybe veintipico not even 30 but i melt like a fucking ice cream i seriously cant handle it, and honestly im damn terrified of visiting Andalucía because i seriously think i would just die
Well, Soria in winter sure kills me
i Freeze at 5°C celsius
Jajajaja not so bad it isn't as cold as it used to be, i like our weather its nice and chilly, you can be at 0° walking putaide and you feel the cold in your skin in a nice way, feels chill, now i live in Burgos this pñace like a fucking polar hell, maybe they are the same temperature but here cold isn't chilly, gets up your damn fucking bones and doesn't matter how many layers you are carrying you ll carry the cold inaide because its windy and wet all fucking day
That sounds awfull
I lived a year in Ireland
It doesn't really get that cold, 8°C, but it's 75% humidity when it's not raining
In winter i wouldn't feel my toes for the whole day, i would thaw them at home
Sometimes It just hailed out of nowhere
once I forgot my coat
i never, ever forgot my coat again
Humidity makes the difference, but negative numbers
nope, feel like another surreal world and i'm not too eager to explore It
Yea fuck humidity, all my homies like dry weather, jokes apart you don't get to below 0 in Barcelona
It was something im so used to i thought happened everywhere
Well, i'm not from Barcelona, but a quick search, shows that, nope, they don't get to 0°C. Once i met a girl from Benidorm and she didn't even own a jacket
no need
As for me i live near Madrid and every year i consider going into hibernation
Less than 0°C IS pretty strange in the city
However, I recently moved to San Lorenzo de El Escorial and that's about 2-4 °C lower, with gale winds
i really Hope the new coat i bought IS good
Oh sorry thought ypu were from Barcelona, damn man not even owning a jacket unbelievable
A map comes to mind at first
If I try thinking of words, "Freude Schöner Gotterfunken" is the first that comes to mind lol
I think in images rather than sounding words
And I see the EU buildings and cities' pictures from the continent
People, party extense
People for the whole different cultures and ways to live, party because I'm lucky and met awesome people from all europe and had great times, extense
well I guess I thought of that because in every corner there is something new and worth learning, so there is an inmense collection of stories and places I will never know about
Mine includes cyprus, and fades as It gets to the caucasus and the ural mountains
As usual
i completely forgot iceland
And Spain is orange and about to become red
You feel European
Like, you actually percieve Europe as your land and home
I don't really feel like I belong in Europe, it's more like a continent I have no particular thoughts about, apart from like "eh, my country is there".
I've been browsing it for years and I still can't tell either
I agree on many points actually lmaoo
I find the different cultures really charming and interesting to look into
However what I picture as "my home" sticks to my own country and maybe the neighbors, Italy, France and Portugal
I can't really imagine moving to a more northern country like Germany or even the UK, those for me represent a lifestyle that's too different from mine (even if I consume British media all the time)
I guess that happens to everyone does, bu I still can't bring myself to calling it home
We can change if you want
Let's do an experiment
You are in a faraway exotic country and then some disaster happens (a tsunami, a terrorist attack, zombie apocalypse, it doesn't matter)
You need help to leave the country but there is no Spanish embassy or any kind of diplomatic mission
So you see three embassies: USA, Germany and Nigeria
Which one do you run to
I think I would clearly and automatically run to the German embassy and happily lick the soil of the motherland Europe (~~then they probably wouldn't help me at all, I don't really know how it works~~ [now I'm really worried what would happen if one day I have to ask for help at another EUM embassy, someone knows if it's possible
Edit: in this case, Germany will help me escape the zombie apocalypse and go home, great
Well, in central Spain the sun is up from 8:30-18:30
Cold in the early mornings (some celsius degrees below zero), but once the sun is up, the temperature is way more comfortable (some days there are 20 degrees between the highest and the lowest temperature of the day)
So I cannot complain, apart for the early morning, things are nice
To say some practical things, vitamin D capsules and a daylight lamp help me to keep some of those feelings in check
But I don't know, I really like winter and I enjoy those days when the air bites your face, because it is that cold
It helps to know, that spring is coming eventually
Also I like it when everything slows down a bit
My parents own a farm
Summer and autumn are actually quite stressful with long working hours and little rest
Winter is our time to take it a little bit slower
As an European I cope by being from southern Europe lol
Do you usually get -20C at the coast or is something rare
It seems
I alsways forget how north the south of Finland is
I anyway thought it was a little bit warmer
My brother lives in Trondheim, Norway, and the climate seems milder there, not usually under -10 and almost no wind, as it is inside a fjord
Do the mountains play a role in it too
In Spanish it can mean both things depending on the context
But in Spanish, instead of meaning bored —as in Italian— it means to be lazy
—Example of being brave: *¿Viste cómo pasó por delante del león sin inmutarse
Qué huevazos tiene* **(Did you see how he passed by the lion without blinking
What a balls he has)**
—Example of being lazy: *¿Todo el dia sin hacer nada
Que huevos más gordos tienes* **(All the day doing nothing
What a fat balls you have)**
***Clarification: In Spanish, the word "huevos" can be translated also as "balls", besides its common meaning which is "eggs".***
In a lot of Spanish speaking countries having “Las pelotas hinchadas” (swollen balls) is to be fed up with something to have “Las pelotas bien puestas” (to have the balls well positioned) is to be brave or ballsy and “tener las pelotas muy grandes” (to have very big balls) is to be cheeky or shameless, but in a negative way
Can be you are either brave, or ypu are too entitled
It's the difference between, echale un par de huevos, and vaya par de huevos
We can say "tener los huevos bien gordos", which could be translated as "to have very big balls" (although it cannot be translated very accurately), to reproach someone for having a  shameless behaviour, but "tener huevos" (to have balls) means "to be brave", indeed
Finland is a compound word that comes from:
"Fin", which means "Straightforward".
and
"Land", which means "Enough of this conversation".
Don’t use double negation
It would be better said as : all day doing nothing
"having balls of steel" LOL, best expression ever XD
In Spain the equivalent "estoy hasta los huevos/cojones"
Nope
I have never heard of it
What is its meaning
So, Fin de la Conversación
Co ro na don't
Full of rich people but boring, boring boring in the end
Lots of cool places to retire that have access to shows, culture, nature and other interesting stuff while you can always do a trip to Switzerland to enjoy the landscape or skiing
There are amazing places to retire off the radar like Lisbon, Ljubljana, Freiburg or Heidelberg, Berlin (such a cool city), San Sebastian, ... it depends on your taste
After 8PM everything is shut down during the cold months
Even in cities like Geneva
There have been cases of Euromillions winners that didn't even cashed out the prize for fear
I think it happened in a very small village in Italy, where this person would have been very easily tracked by the mafia
Lesser of evils
It would be even worse in a two party system, but I still have to hold my nose when I vote lmao
From Spain, always the lesser evil, I don't believe in our political system
If I still vote at this point is to keep full blown fascists and ultranationalists off office, but that's a low bar
Everything else is just business as usual with different flavours, so I don't even care, to hell with it all
In the local elections (the mayor of my town), I truly believe in the guy I vote for
He's from a left-wing party but he's done so well these last years that almost everyone in the town votes for him, regardless of their political orientation
Iirc he has 15 out of 21 councillors so he gets like 75% of the votes
In the regional elections, eh
I kinda like the guy I vote for but I'm not 100% sold on him
He's also the guy/pàrty in power and if anything, we did really well in the COVID-19 pandemic, I guess
I'm almost surely going to keep voting for him, so I do respect him
In the national elections, hell no
It's always the lesser evil for me
It's not that I hate all the major political parties, some are okay, but there's huge downsides to all of them from my point of view
Overall I never really "regretted" a vote but more than a few times I've ended up thinking I should have voted for someone else
But in the end I always tend to vote similar parties so it's not true regret, more of a "eh, should have gone with this guy instead".
Given that there's no party running that appeal to all my main believes, I tend to vote for the ones that are more palatable to me, so I guess "the lesser evil"?
Here it actually increased, from the 21% of smokers in 2017 to 23,3% in 2019
The percentage of smokers went from 33,7% in 1995 to 23% in 2014
It went down a few points more but then it went up again to 23% last year
Generally it's perceived as something unhealthy, most people hate the smell and it's forbidden by law in all interior public spaces (bars, restaurants, workplaces
Nice weather
Third most common language
Lowish cost of living
I'm lucky to have a job that lets me work from anywhere
8 years ago, I spent a year studying in London, and after that, I knew that the only place I wanted to live was some big city in Europe
Unfortunately for my plans at the time, it is very difficult to get a visa to live in the UK if you're a young American fresh out of uni
Once I had a work situation that gave me some more flexibility, I began to look for countries where I could get a visa while being able to provide for myself economically
One of the first countries that came up was Spain
I could have likely sorted out a visa to most western European countries, I saw similar visas in Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, but I had been to Spain several times and had Spanish friends from my time in London
I liked that the language was one of the most useful languages world-wide, I liked that Spain generally has better weather than other countries in Western Europe, and the cost of living, even in Madrid is quite reasonable, especially to where I was living in the USA (Hawaii)
I also just liked the Spanish approach to life - lots of personal time, lots of food, lots of wine, lots of social activity, big emphasis on family - which I don't have in Spain, but several friends families take me in for holidays and vacations
I pulled the trigger, which required going to the Spanish consulate in San Francisco twice, and moved here in the autumn of 2015
It's now been over 4
5 years and I don't care to live anywhere else
I've got a solid group of friends, I have a very comfortable apartment that I share with one other guy, I share an office in the city center with some other freelancers, and live a pretty normal life here
My Spanish is really good these days and I feel like I am able to fit into society
I live a much better life here, not even just from an economical standpoint, than I could in the USA or even in the UK
When this coronavirus situation is over, I'll be applying for permanent residency, and hopefully in 5 more years, my passport
Spain isn't for everyone, life is different here than a lot of places and while I did move here on a bit of a whim, it's all worked out for the best and it's the best decision I've ever made
Welcome to Spain
Welcome, amigo
¿La tortilla de patatas con o sin cebolla
Glad you like Spain
Hope you get your permanent residency and, if you finally wish, your citizenship
We have a lot of defects, but I truly think we're a welcoming society
Good luck, and learn as much French as you can beforehand
Lots of bureaucratic tasks to do in France where no one is going to speak English
I've been here for 15 years
I think I'm more Spanish than Canadian at this point
Siempre con
Practice your Spanish
You've earned my love, and we allow you to live here, otherwise we would have kicked you out:)
Don't change a Spanish recipe in front of a Spaniard
It doesn't end well
Jamie Oliver, we still remember you
We don't go everywhere dressed as flamencos
Ffs we have fashion sense
Spain is south of Mexico
(Intense glares)
PREPARE TO DIE
There's more though
Cooking IS a point of national pride so generally that's where you want to hit us
A valencian could potentially Talk an HOUR about what IS and what is not a paella (though what REALLY trigers them is: "valencian IS not a language but a dialect of catalan"  they Burn like fallas)
Finland is the ballsack of scandinavia
And no spaniard would ever shout "Viva la France", due to silly country rivalty or whatever you may call it
Yeah, in spanish IS a bit weird, because the low countries IS the name of the netherlands
but historically it's also the name of flanders which includes belgium
What i'm trying to say is that I think there's historical reasons for the mix up
If anyone knows something more feel free to tell me
I'm ready for your undiying hate, but if anyone asked me I would say eastern europe
I guess I lack the historical knowledge to mark it as central and not eastern europe, but if you are in the right part of the map you are eastern for me
_Ah yes, I start to feel the rage of polish readers through the screen_
I swear if one more valenciano starts with the "that's arroz con cosas" for a pretty acceptable paella-like plate I will stamp their face in the socarrat
In Spain we say "La republica Checa" (the Czech Republic)
In Spanish too, I guess it comes from the time that was part of the Spanish empire and because it's been the most influential regions
Currently they're promoting to change it to Netherlands (países bajos) which was an existing term but not nearly as popular
It seems fair after mispronouncing it for so many centuries
In Spanish most people call it "Holanda" but the official name is "Los paises bajos" which means the Low lands
Yeah, I heard they have a lot of venomous animals
I would never live there lol
>socarrat
Noooo that's the BEST part
_I see you are a man of culture as well_
(sharpens the knife furiously)
_The true paella lover is not the one who fights over silly details, but the one who apreciates the socarrat no matter what is made of_
look man I'm not even mad anymore, I just wish I could make a good burrito by myself
Edit: yes, with my latino knife
The median age of my country is 44 years, being one of the countries which has the oldest people
That we have a small desert in the Iberian Peninsula
It's called Bardenas Reales (it's in Navarra (Spain)) if you are curious
I think some films were recorded there
I've heard in a podcast that since the iberian and italian peninsulas were highly romanized, they had better sewage systems than the rest of europe during the medieval period, and that the stereotypical dirty medieval city from movies is only accurate for cities outside those regions
They also said in that podcast that christian cities in iberia were highly autonomous nearly to the same degree than city-states in Italy
It is also the feminine form of "limón" the Spanish word for lemon, which make some sense as they come from identical trees (although this doesn't make much sense because "limón" comes from an Arab word)
It also wouldn't make sense because "limón" doesn't have feminine, although I get what you meant
In a full beach you will always see at least one or two topless women, which will probably shock someone not used to it
It's still about 10% like everyone else is saying
Fun fact: it's probably much closer to 50% when they are 60+ years old
It's not the same natives and tourists (tourists tend to do it more often since no one they know will see them), and it's not the same a public beach or a private pool
In Mallorca among natives and in public beaches I'd say 5-10%
I'm from the north part of Spain (Galicia), and the % is very low, it's very extrange to see someone doing it, I would say 1 in 250 women, or something like that
I live in the south of Spain
The percentage of women with bewbs out on the beach is around 30%. Keeping in mind a lot of those women are tourists, the percent of Spanish women with their bewbs out is more like 60%
I'd like to point out it's the older generations of women that sunbathe in Spain
I'd say it's still a rather common practice
From my experience it's about 30 to 40%
Yup, i think 50 % is *way* too much, that means that about half of women go topless, and  that doesn't happen, at least not the beaches i got to
And there's also a difference between beaches and pools, i barely ever see topless women, whereas in the beaches you can usually see a few
But 20% still seems like a lot to me, maybe more like 10% from my experience, since i've been to really crowded beaches and only seen a few
Am Spanish and woman
Yeah no, definitely not 50/100, much closer to a sixth or possibly a fifth
The more crowded the beach is, the lower the proportion of topless women is
It's rare but I have actually seen over 50%, but that's in beaches where you can stay 5 to 10 meters away of anybody else
Agree
Also, women that do topless don't do it all the time or on the same beaches
Some of my friends will go topless on a city beach and some of them will only go topless in more quiet, less crowded beaches
So it depends on the location as well, and I will respect ss topless in tourist beaches or public pools
> 0% is just ridiculous, it would mean that middle-aged women do topless too
They do it all the time, at least in the Mediterranean
I'd dare to say more than the younger ones
As some other fellows have posted here, the older you get, the less fucks you give
Actually I think that middle aged and old women topless way more than young women
Not much, most of the time parents buy one classic set to their kids (40€)
It's much less common to buy your kid the collectionists' sets as they're more expensive (100-150€)
Back in the day, here in Spain LEGO had a local competitor called TENTE, who had smaller pieces and was cheaper
Production stopped in 2007
(Spain)
It's not cheap, that's for sure
Some decent sets, either franchise or creator are between 10€ and 50€, but expect to spend more than 100-200€ on most of them
Most expensive ones go for 300-500€ or even more
I'd say they are relatively expensive, but I love them because it's basically unlimited fun once you or your kids have them
For some reason I understood middle English better that the early modern one, maybe it's just me
I can understand basically all of the early and middle but I don't understand a single word from old onwards
The reason I understand the early and middle it's because it sounds like when Spaniards speak English for their first time and from there I basically approximate it
Also because of manga characters that speak like that lmao
Middle English is like poorly spoken English by a Spaniard lmao
The revolt of Los comuneros in 1521
I'm letting you do the research, because it's a LONG one
But really, *really* cool
Do you guys literally celebrate an attempted terrorist attack
Spain's bonfire night is the night of 23rd to 24th of June, Saint John's Eve
But, we have many, many holidays and festivals around the country
Fallas, Moros y Cristianos, Tomatina, San Fermin
In Spain, St John/ San Juan is celebrated in almost any place that has a beach
The tradition is to wash your face in the sea at midnight to attract good luck, burn the bad ones in a bonfire (papers with messages about the bad things that have happened during the year, for example) and then jump over it three times, to scare away all the bad things
Surely there are different traditions in each place, these are the ones I know
PS: You also drink and eat a lot
We celebrate the arrival of plagues, rape and death to half of a continent by the hand of careless power-hungry douchebags
Not that much of a difference
He goy his revenge with people buying V for Vendetta masks
True, I ate half the sentence when writing, will edit rn
Rajoy has some hits
[It's very difficult todo esto]  is master Spanglish
And when [he doesn't even try]  it's even funnier
But I have to go with [this]  You might be thinking that's some good English right there, but plot twist
>!...it wasn't him talking, he was being dubbed by a native speaker
[Ana Botella] was the Mayor of Madrid at the time
This was her speech defending the candidature for the Olympic games in 2013
Every spaniard remembers the phrase 'a relaxing cup of café con leche in Plaza Mayor'.
You may haven't seen this outside Spain, but we have a video OF NOT OTHER THAN FUCKING FRANCO butchering english like the half brain moron he was, enjoy it
This is the famous one and still a joke when you want to offer someone a cup of coffe
Ana Botella Mayor of Madrid (2011 - 2015) talking to the Olypic committee
-Minute 1:40- the most memorable part
A relaxing cup of café con leche in the puerta del sol
Every spanish person knows this quote
Well, Franco spoke such an awful English that you cannot understand a single [thing]
Relaxi café con leche in Plaza Mayor by Ana Botella
The words are English but the soundis 100% German
Tbh I understand him much better than I usually understand people with a British accent
Maybe I should take up my English lessons again
You probably don't know that this [living legend] exists
The subtitles make it even better lmao
Emilio Botin and Abel Caballero are a close second
Whaaaat
How had I never seen the video of the Valencian guy
Lol, he is shameless
The voice is clearly a British person, did he think he could fool people
She was criticized in Madrid, kind of becoming a meme, but the truth is 'café con leche' can be used in English just the way 'café au lait' and 'caffe latte' can (ever seen a Starbucks menu
) The only thing remarkable about the way she speaks is that's it's sort of forced and unnatural, as if someone were trying to slowly recite something from memory in school
Overall, it's much better than others linked here
The remix was [awesome
I see your Ana Botella and show my [Franco
Oh also we have some more modern assholes to laugh at, some years ago this video went viral  of the Madrid mayor being a fucking moron too
We also had our previous president Rajoy, which was notorious because he couldn't even make a full phrase in spanish without messing up and looking like a kid with learning issues, he also completly butchered english, i mean he cant even speak proper spanish so no surprise there isn't that many videos because he ended up avoiding any conversation in english embarrasibg himself when he had to treat with international figures
relaxing cup of C*a*fe **Co**N lEs^(he)
Oh my god it doesn't even sound real, it looks straight out of a sitcom
How did I not know about that
It just made my day
Thank you my friend
El "subtitulado" lo hace aún mejor
This is so good
Her accent is atrocious and I wonder if native speakers of English would understand her, but she gave it a good try
It's strange, I had the feeling he was quite fluent the first 30 seconds but when he said "botar os marcos dos apartamentos" (?), I realized I had no idea what he was talking about anymore
But mad respect for Costa for standing up for Spain with the Covid19 budget issue
Hahaha, it isn't that bad, it's obvious that he's not native
Although the accent itself is good, you can notice that he's "inventing" few words or forming some sentences in ways that aren't natural in Spanish
but I could understand the 100% of what he said :)
Thank you
I thought nobody was going to link that
She's been a meme for years although it isn't that bad
I dislike this woman profoundly, but I think she did a good job here and I like that she said a few words in Spanish, she wanted her speech to have a Spanish flavour
I think that was a great choice for the context
I'm dead
That "Viva España" was like we are donde with this shit
Also, this gem in the comments:
> Franco no hacía el workbook
I am surprised nobody mentioned Sergio Ramos
The pronunciation may not be the worst, especially considering other examples in this thread
But I fucking hate the discourse
It sounds like it was written by a 5 year old
Spaniard here: I can only understand a few words, it's really difficult to decipher even for us
Spanish politics has become very polarized, and people will jump on anything if they get to criticize the opposite party
She became a proper meme for a month with many people who disliked her making fun of that: 'café con leche'. Honestly seeing echoes of the US's approach to politics now
Everything's very tribal, and sensibility is being put aside in favour of supporting your party, whatever it says/does in opposition to all others
Well apart of the american colonization which is pretty famous, another atrocity that isn't that well known is that spaniards captured about 14
000 frenchmen (Napoleon invaded Spain, Spain started fightin, won and made prisoners), 4
000 were sent to the Canary Islands and they had a pretty good time there, but the other 10
000 were sent to the Balearic Islands, and when they arrived to Mallorca the people didn't want 10
000 french soldiers there, so they brought them to a desert island, Cabrera, not too big, 16 km\^2 and not too far away from the main island, Mallorca, only 60 km, but enough to make the escape impossible
At first the spaniards brought food and water every day, but there was a storm and spaniards couldnt bring food and water to the frenchmen, so 8 days later, when they went there, french tried to steal the ship, some spaniards died but they could scape, since that day nobody wanted to go fed the frenchmen and they stayed without food nor water in a desert island for 3 months until the next ship went there
A lot of them died from starvation, others had to eat their own shit, a total disaster, and there were cannibalism as well
Only 3600 frenchmen out of 10000 survived and were liberated 5 years after they were captured when Spain and France signed the peace
It's considered the first concentration camp, 130 years before Hitler's (1809-1814)
Well
I can only say that nobody expected it
In 1936, a lot of people who were said to be "supporters of the sublevation" were put in prison, with any sentence at all
They were later brought from the prisons to be executed in what became known as "sacas". There were a total of 33, between the 7th of November and 4th of December
This incident is known as "Matanzas de Paracuellos" and It costed around 12
000 lives
Another interesting one is the mass execution in Badajoz, during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)
After the "National" forces, as they called themselves, also known as the Blue forces lead by Lieutenant Colonel Yagüe took the city of Badajoz, they took the prisoners to the bullring (between 1800 and 4000 people, though sources vary) and  executed them, if not there at the cemetery
This gained Lieutenant Yagüe the title of "El Carnicero de Badajoz", the butcher of Badajoz
Also not contempt with that they kept the mass sacking, raping and murdering for another week or so
The blue forces then burnt all the bodies whether they were militiamen or civilians to "not leave any enemies on their rear".
I'd argue that Spain has committed atrocities far, far more bloody and inhumane than the Inquisition
It's not that it wasn't a thing, but I'd say its legend overweights its reality by a lot
Sorry for the link, I'm on mobile
Edit: typos because of mobile -_-
The things the Francoists did in the civil war as a whole rank very high in the list of atrocities in and by Spain
The civil war in general was absolutely baffling in terms of the brutatlity by both sides, but especially by Franco during and after the war
Let's not forget that Yagüe still has a village named after him, San Leonardo de Yagüe where he's buried, which last year held a ceremony to honor him
Yes, civil war was brutal, in Paracuellos, the republican or red forces (the good ones) killed in cold blood between 1
000 and 12
000 people (sources vary), unarmed prisoners
000 of them were incarcerated before the war even began, so they didnt commit any war crimes at all, and they were killed in cold blood anyway, the others were right-wing civilians, catholic priests and military made prisoners
What a massacre considering they were the heroes of the story fighting the devil itself (blue or national force)
Many many families are still in the process of finding each other
The guy was later interviewed regarding this specific event at what he responded:
"Of course we killed them, what did you expect
That I would take four thousand red prisoners with me, while my column had to advance on a race against the clock
Or that I would free them behind me and leave Badajoz to turn red again
And while he did have a point, it seems like he felt no remorse whatsoever for what he did
Despacito it was our fault after all
Spanish colonization wiped out most of the natives in America
Spanish Inquisition was quite fucked up
Well, there are some things, I wouldn't know how to choose
-Expelling the jews of Spain
-Taking part in the slave business in Africa
-The illnesses we took with us to America, where people was not accustomed to live near cattle and did not have the antibodies, but that was not voluntary
-Allow the Sahara people to be attacked by Morocco, after it stopped being a colony
Something
unexpected
Isn't Luis Fonsi Puerto Rican, though
Just reggaeton in general
̶T̶̶b̶̶h̶ ̶m̶̶o̶̶s̶̶t̶ ̶n̶̶a̶̶t̶̶i̶̶v̶̶e̶̶s̶ ̶d̶̶i̶̶e̶̶d̶ ̶d̶̶u̶̶e̶ ̶t̶̶o̶ ̶t̶̶h̶̶e̶ ̶d̶̶i̶̶s̶̶e̶̶a̶̶s̶̶e̶̶s̶
And without the Spanish empire
Give me a break
I cannot remember everything, I had totally forgotten about that
Yeah as I recall there were many extreme-right/fascist parties in Germany at the time and Hitler just brought the NSDP to the top of the pile
In my opinion even without Hilter a fascist government would’ve taken hold of Germany but we’ll never know how things go from there
YES, YES, WE DO
Well, kind of, and I thing it's only in my region
We have "Azogue", which if you look it up you'll find it's an adjective for a very nervous person
That's in the context of " It's sunday evening, I am bored, I can't go anywhere because everything is closed, nothing good on the TV
", so you just move around your house anxiously
But we use it as a noun, more than an adjective
I'm from south Alicante, so there's influence from both Murcia and Valencia
However I do think this word is from my neighboring towns, though
What really ancient tradition you still practice
For example here, the 24th June we make fires all over the place, we jump them at least 9 times ("to put demons away" they say) and we decorate our houses with certain plants
From what I know, this tradition has a Celtic origin
An Spanish that doesn't like Iberian ham
*That is me
A Spaniard who hates football and bullfighting
This literally triggers me
This hurts on a spiritual level
Now we're 2 of us
That's a great idea to promote cycling
Cross-country or alpine
Me too
I completely understand you
El sol (male) = The Sun
Helios (Greek god) = Sol (Roman god)
La luna (female) = The Moon
Selene (Greek goddess) = Luna (Roman goddess)
I had curiosity about Old English (before genders disappeared)
Sunne (femenine)
mōna (masculine)
Similar to German (It makes sense, they are cognates)
EL sol, Sun (masculine) and LA luna, Moon (feminine)
El Sol (male) La Luna (female)
Reason: *R* *O* *M* *A* *N* *S*
This has to be Roman/Greek heritage
The Moon are the goddesses Selene/Luna and Diana/Artemis and the Sun is the god Helios/Sol and Apollo
I'd be surprised if it were otherwise haha
The Spanish Golden Time, also called "The Golden Century" (although it lastsd more than 100 years)
1492-1659/1981 was a time where Spain rose not only as an Empire, but also in architecture, paintings, music, literature
so this artistic aspect together with the political and strategical development of the country is considered to be the golden age
Note: if it was only the expanse of the empire I wouldn't consider it the golden age, it's the development in arts what gives it the touch
After the discovery of America, we literally just started making churches with golden interiors
If that's not golden age I don't know anymore
When the Dutch got independence that's when things went downhill
From 1492 until the 16th century or so, basically the Spanish Empire, where the sun never sets
Many Spanish mention the Siglo de Oro, which I agree with, but personally living in Andalusia and having seen the Alhambra and Mosque of Córdoba, I have to mention the early-middle times of Muslim rule as very prosperous and prolific in terms of wealth, science, philosophy and art
The Empire may have reached farther, but it stood on very deep roots, which grew during that time
Figuratively and literally too
note: I meant up to the year 1681, not 1981 (just in case)
We use it in spanish too
Oh yes indeed, that is also a small "golden time" for art in Spain, specially with the Generation of '27 and other poets / writers
This was a generation of artists with great influence and legacy, in a time where Spaniards has to redefine who they were as a nation, but is indeed a short period of time that is generally overshadowed by the war afterwards
I don't believe it's an unpopular opinion, and it should have more considerance because it has a great legacy
I just thought of the Siglo de Oro as the prime example of golden time
I politely disagree
The Generation of '27 (1927) flourished in a time of crisis, both spiritual  and political / economical
Their themes in novels and poetry usually make references to "who we really are as a nation", decadence and a search for something else, making it a special time for art and literature in Spain
That's why it's usually referred to as the Silver age
I have some
One was on my first roadtrip throughout Europe
Me and a friend were traveling extremely cheap for a number of reasons, we had terrible bank numbers but we needed to get away for a while so badly, so whatever, we camped and slept in the car for most of the trip
We didn't have significant trouble, maybe some homeless people or drunk bums forcing us out or landowners asking us to leave, but all good
Until one night in Romania, near Craiova, we set a tarmac in what seemed to be like a reasonably secluded stretch of woods, and left the car 50m away
We woke up in the night because we heard some noises, and a random group of people were literally tearing the car apart by smashing it
We shouted and they began to chase us for a bit, then left, but we RAN
We fled as we could (slashed tires), reported to the police, and sorted out the papers to scrap my buddy's car
They didn't even stole anything, just damaged the car to a point were it was lost cause
We took buses and hitchhiked back home
I enjoyed Romania a lot, will go back if I can, but I won't set foot on that city ever again
Crazy folks I tell you
The post is 7 hours old and not a single bad hotel experience in Spain
Nice
Although at least 2 muggings in Barcelona, little surprise there
I live in Benidorm so
not vacation but people in vacation
Sketchy place indeed, but there is crazy people everywhere, could have happened in Madrid for that matter
I really liked Romania, beautiful scenery and rich history, just a scary experience among many other excellent ones
Oh, I did
We were heading for Bucharest to decide whether we continued to Bulgaria or ended the trip
We didn't actually meant to visit Craiova (no offense), but toured Cluj, Brasov, Sibiu, Sighisoara and more, crossed the mountains after a few days and were just very tired so we slept there, that's why
I've never been mugged, but walking by the Sagrada Familia might have been the closest call
My memory is fuzzy but I remember a group of young odd-looking guys following us for a couple minutes
I think the worst hotel I've been to was probably a youth hostel in London, which had tiny rooms, cold showers and a stairwell barely sufficient for one person going up and one person going down, which must have served around 5-6 floors
My 'worst' experience (although the journey itself was a blast) is probably when I left my stuff at a bus in Florence
I remembered to take my backpack but left a small travel pouch that had several cool mementos plus my wallet, so I was stranded without ID
I realised just as the bus took off and went running to the "garage" (the place were buses stay after they finish travelling for the day), which was sadly closed by less than 10 minutes
Then I spent the next day travelling up and down Florence to find a police station to get the document I needed for getting into my flight, which was that same evening
Finally after going to THREE police stations, because the first two were only city police and thus not able to process my request (?) I got the Carabinieri to file what I needed filed and was able to return home
I tell you, no tourist had ever crossed the streets I have in Florence
If this were an open world game, I would have glitched the map
Anyways, I'm still alive, every time I travel I get paranoid about my cards/passport and I unfortunately never got to finish the book that I kept in that bag
That sucks too
Here's to travels without troubles (after the virus)
Cheers
We have a restaurant in the very center, in Plaza Mayor, called "Las cuevas de Luis Candelas". Luis Candelas was a bandit born in the center of Madrid too, well known because he didn't kill nor injured and also shared his loot
To attract the many tourists that pass through the area, at the door of the restaurant, it has been a tradition for many years, there is a man dressed as the daring bandit
In addition, he carries a blunderbuss, the traditional weapon at the time
Two rookie Municipal Policemen stopped the patrol car and asked the disguised guy, at the door of the restaurant, if he had a license to carry the weapon
The man tried to explain to them that he was only in disguise and that the blunderbuss was disabled but he made the mistake of telling them that there were many more old weapons inside the restaurant
The Municipal Police returned to the car, requested reinforcements, put on bulletproof vests and immobilized the fake bandit while waiting for help to arrive, disregarding the comments and appreciations a numerous crowd was trying to make them understand
When the reinforcements arrived, they couldn't believe the stupidity of the two brats
**Edit**: [The fake Luis Candelas]
Potsdam
Edit: It’s interesting that he died months before coming back there for the Conference after WWII ended
The entire north of spain is beautiful and with awesome beaches but people just want the sun^(tm)
for anyone interested in the roman empire or pre-roman cultures theres lots of spots that are quite comfortable to visit
Theres lots of medieval stuff too
I dont understand why brits all go to the south in summer, wich is scorching hot
I'd rather be in northern spain in summer where theres a comfortable 20º to 30ºC weather
Trust me, the north is full of tourists, specially french people
Yesterday I was walking on the main Street of my city and There were more tourists than actual native people
I think the most underrated places are in the interior part of the country, such as Extremadura and the Castillies
Really wonderful places that even spanish people forget about
I love Asturias
Salamanca is very beautiful too, although I might be biased as I live here haha
Y demos gracias de que no esté como el Mediterráneo, así podemos disfrutarlo mucho mejor
I am from the basque country and the cities of bilbao and san sebastian are cool
Good food (i wouldn't call it fusion really) but expensive
The entire north of spain has some amazing products
In terms of beauty tho, cantabria-asturias are muuuuuch prettier
And la mancha has some cool places with castles and stuff and toledo is beautiful but the landscape is boring as hell
I live in Salamanca and there are actually more foreign people than one may think, mainly students on Erasmus and such
Vigo is sooo fun and the food is great
Applicabel to all galicia
Yeah vitoria is tiny but you can easily find flights to bilbao, the biggest city in the region
They are so freaking cool looking
A "road trip" from bilbao to san sebastia along the coast road is one of the best things you can do in basque country
The entire northern coast of spain is gorgeous tho
I know it pretty well and my favorite spot is the hidden beach of Sonabia, in cantabria
A huge grassy cliff over an awesome beach
Perfect for surf too
Absolutely
Asturias and Cantabria are really beautiful
Can't recommend them enough
There are also many interesting cities across Spain with a lot of museums, monuments and beautiful architecture
Madrid, Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Granada, Santiago, Salamanca, Soria, Córdoba and more
How did you know where I was from
*joke
But yes, once I went to a country house in Picos de Europa and it was such an amazing place
And nobody was there
I mean that's just a kind of paella
Your friends did something weird hahaah
What's typical about the basque country (or tbh used to since it spreaded to other places a couple decades ago) is the pintxos
Litoe portions of food but that inlike tapas you pay for them
In certian places they are a bit fusion and a bit more creative
That's what tourists love about san sebastian for instance
Take it from a basque
The modern nationalist movements were based in a romantization of a past that never existed like how catalans talk about pthings that never existed like the catalan countries or the catalano-aragonese confederation when in fact it was just the crown if aragon
And if you researchbadque nationalism you'll see the father of basque nationalism was a disgusting racist
I mean research of you want but you won't find the same stuff you irish people have haha
I  lived in the basque country for 18 years and in catalonia for 3
I saw the dame shit in both places, a political movement that splits the population between the good ones and the bad ones
You may know more than the average bit you still know shit about it
Both of those nationalisms have made both cstalans and basques into sheep that just follow what their leaders say
It's a cultural brainwashing and it's disgusting
Now i live in madrid and omg it feels good to be free and not being judged for what i believe in
Please keep this kind of tweeter arguments out of Reddit
I've lived in both sides
A litle bit of nationalism is ok, more than a litle bit makes the population into retards with superiority complex
Between the 2 spanish nationalism is muuuch milder and inclusive
I'm not kidding when i tell you that the hardcore nationalists treat other spaniards like shit
If you're specifically looking to work in Germany or Switzerland, then German is the clear choice
Job market wise, those two are good places to look, however the language is only really useful there
If you're looking for flexibility I'd say continue with French or maybe try Spanish
Both of those languages are not only spoken in their own country but are also very popular in other regions of the world
They also give you a good base, with Spanish you can get by or at least communicate with Portuguese, Italian and to a degree French speakers
If you were to move to any of the regions that speak those languages you could pick them up much more quickly than if you chose German for example
I live in Mallorca so German is almost as important as English, but it's super hard and I'm ashamed of trying to speak it knowing that I suck
Thankfully 80% of the germans clients I've had so far speak Spanish fairly well
In Spain, apart from english, many places loook for french and maybe portuguese
Don't be modest, the correct answer is German
Agree
Also German would help you learning Dutch, and French,  Italian and Spanish
No, Italian accent for Spanish it's quite distinct
Perhaps the musicality is somehow similar but that's all
Demographics has nothing to do if the industries doesnt move to Poland as well
Look at India, same population as China (aprox) but on no way as relevant because China attracts and creates industry hubs
In Germany car brand alone (BMW, Mercedes Daimler, Audi, VW, etc
) are difficult to top
German banks and Insurance companies (Allianz), Medical industry (Bayer), Air industry (Lufthansa, Airbus), clothes (Nike and Adidas), food distribution (Lidl, Aldi) and many more industries have their HQ in Germany creating a heavy focus on the country being the biggest economy of EU
Like even if Poland grows in population, unless there is the same growth (and It has to be very high, not just 2-3% of gdp) in economic industries, I don't see your scenario happening
From the top of my head I'd say [this ] of Laura Pausini, she has a very good Spanish thought
For a thicker Italian accent maybe try to find some Ancelotti press conference when he was the Real Madrid manager
italian IS actually way older than most people think
Starting roughly in the renaissance
People fry eggs with butter
This seems stupid but blew my mind, butter
Here we do It with olive oil
The nordics are surprisingly funny, and play into each others countries constantly and i LOVE It
There's a large pecentage of portuguese in Luxembourg
It was like 10%? I mean, why
Once i got a detailed explanation of the political landscape of poland from a polish
i treasure It
Definetely one of the reasons i'm in this sub, getting first hand accounts on news about Europe
How increadibly rigid id the korean society around dating
From an American/swiss Who lived in seoul
We also have drying cabinets in Spain
We have plate drying racks above the sink in Spain too
There's an enormous percentage of portuguese in Andorra too
It is illegal to pick mushrooms in some areas of Spain unless you have a permit
It's to prevent people from picking mushrooms illegally
You have to cut them at the stem with a knife and carry them in a basket or box with tiny holes so some spores will fall as you take them away; some illegal mushroom pickers don't do that, so now permits are required for it
>While teaching English in pretty much almost every non-English-speaking countries, Dora teaches Spanish in Romania
That's amazing
>Germans and Swiss really are living stereotypes when it comes to giving overly detailed answers
that's so true
hmm, In what sense
There's a lot
If you go to very remote places on the countryside you can find roads with potholes here as well
There are also some old, badly paved highways, that they end up fixing eventually, but it takes forever
I'm guessing up there -10º is hot is the equivalent of the 35º is cold here
I try to do the same, ghee when Indian, butter when northern, but the rest gets either olive oil or sunflower
Other oils are a bit HARDER to find an then there's canola
It's actually REALLY hard to get canola oil in Spain
And we know why
There was a huge medical emergency in 1981
Some genius added canola oil for industrial use with the one sold for consumption, apparently to cut costs
The only problem IS that it's neurotoxic, affected over 20
000 people and killed 1100
So the oil still has kind of a bad rep around here
Because it's cheaper, healthier and has a nice flavour
But i Guess in sweeden it's more expensive and with no flavour at all
I tried It, it's nice, but i won't be doing It again
I like olive oil better
Butter gives a nice subtle sweetness and acidity which IS good, kind of milky
Olive oil IS much more flavourfull, more acidic, just a tad bitter, a hint of spiciness, there's much more going on
It just tastes great
It's a completely different experience and though butter does work really well with eggs i have to give It to olive oil
If i wanted to make a creamy subtle Dish i would go with butter
Try frying eggs with olive oil, you'll LOVE it
I think i'm gonna try butter today
then i can finally say olive oil IS best
Well the thing IS that Italy IS a very modern country and many people have at least Heard that they have a few dialects
So many just assume that the language was created as a lingual franca of sorts during the unification
It has actually happened in Other places (for example Indonesia) but not Italy
I didn't know
So they're just everywhere in Europe
I just found It weird
Why of all places Luxembourg
I know the germans promoted turkish inmigration and i vaguely remember that sweeden gave assilum to somalians (though i might be wrong)
but why the hell did the portuguese go in mass to Luxembourg
And why only the portuguese
I remember that in Ireland they've got a good share of polish, while in Spain romanians are much more common
This kind of things usually stem from somewhere
So if you know more, do tell
To tomato sauce, no
That'd be like making croissants with olive oil
You just LOVE your butter
In Spain you usually need a permit, to prevent bad practices
Don't forget not selling out to oil companies
It's basically a must for them
Some years ago I went with a friend to Hockenheimring, the F1 circuit in Germany, and it was a cold and windy morning, we were waiting for the exhibition races to start, my friend and I with a pair of jackets were suffering
after a while I see two finns wearing a t-shirt and enjoying the "summer", they even bought a pair of icecreams, that day I decided that people from Finland are White Walkers
Michael Schumaker won the race, fuck you Raikkonen, go eat some icecream with vodka :)
I've seen those in Spain, but the drying rack in the cabinet, usually called [escurreplatos] , is more common
They're are one of the countries in Europe with more people living abroad, like 30 per cent
It's insane
You gotta keep flowing those dollars
Holy shit
\-10º is basically a new ice age, water freezing, kids freezing, everything freezing and we basically dig under layers of blankets and proceed to hibernate until that's basically over
35º C is a cold summer day here
Hahahaahah this is like when tourist come here in summer, and while we are wearing swimsuits, they are somehow wearing jackets
To be fair they are also wearing swimsuits and flip-flops with sockets so I don't know what to say haha
p.s. Vettel ftw :P
Ohhh sounds more like "papapapapapapapapapapapagiiiiiii"
High temperature IS justified but why low temperature implies butter
You can Cook with oil at low temperatures
For example tomato sauce IS made with OLIVE OIL
though i've Heard of a polish Guy that uses butter . The thing IS that our food tastes to olive oil and yours to butter
And that's that
Then there's limits, for example butter Burns easily because It's rich in proteins
If you want those proteins then butter IS mandatory (making buttermilk, for examole)
if you don't want them you can use oil or simply clarify the butter
in the end it comes down to taste
And butter has a very distinctive taste
As do "unrefined" oils
For example in shichuanese cuisine the norm IS unrefined rapeseed oil, which apparently has a mustardy flavour
Spanish cuisine has 4 key ingredients, olive oil, garlic, onion and salt
That makes sense
Well, there's actually no need for them because tomato sauce thickens by itself
so tomato sauce doesn't need any emulsion (which IS mostly done to thicken sauces)
In fact most recipees ask to get the sauce out when the oil has completely separated from the rest
meaning the complete opposite of emulsified
And i'm sorry, but i don't know marcella harzan (just looked her Up) and americans know nothing of italian food, so i'm....half-jokingly questioning her work
Though butter IS used surprisingly often in Italian cooking, way more than in spanish
What part of Spain are you in where 35° C is a cold summer day, the hottest I remember it getting here in canarias is around like 40° C.
I'll try It, seems like a nice trick
Holy shit, I want to try that someday man like being cold-proof in a cold place
LMAO Where can I see that
haha
In murcia, but also andalusia so its pretty common reach that temperatures
By the way, someone asked me this and i wasn't sure
You know that butter IS waaaaaay less healthy than olive oil, right
Recently, Francisco Franco
Historically, probably King charles the IV, a hot turd of a king
One is not enough
[Can I help you to make up your mind
I think that Charles IV and Fernando VII go hand in hand
Sport-wise: Mauro Tassotti
Currently, many politicians hit by corruption cases: Bárcenas, Pujol, Aguirre, Villarejo (police officer), etc
Bonus track: The monarchy, especially Juan Carlos I and his son in law Iñaki Urdangarín.
Like father like son
People actually wanted Fernando VII back
How from Felipe V or Carlos III, who were effective administrators and statesmen (despite Felipe being kind of a dick), then came three totally fucked up generations with Carlos IV, Fernando VII, Don Carlos and Isabel II
And finally when came a decent one in the shape of Alfonso XII, he dies after just 11 years
Yeah but he had a mental illness
It was not his fault he was a gentic fuckup
He (well, his mother Marianne of Austria and his later ministers after Marianne's death) was actually better than his father and grandfather
The economy could recover a little and it was a rather peaceful era
Until he dies, of course
Philip the II here is considere among the best, if not the best
I am of the opinion that the republic was a huuuuuge mess and that they coul'd have never ever won the war
So saying "if they had won" makes no sense
And the fact that the republic might have been somewhat better than franco makes no sense either, since franco was the one that actually won and the one that was a dictator for 40 years
He's hated with reasons
Sadly, Stalin has supporters in Russia that see him as a WW2 hero and great leader
Because they didn't know what kind of king he was
He was just the person to rally for if you were against Charles IV and Napoleon
He made true the saying "Más vale malo conocido que bueno por conocer".
Well, when playing for Madrid, if you don't support them, yes
But then, when playing for Spain, not at all
He is the captain
Meant the IV
Genocide of the basques
Wtf are you talking about
I'm basque and there was no genocide
And he was not a nice guy
He was a dictator
Not as brutal as others physivally but ideologically he was a cancer to spain
Yeah lol, genocide is a strobg word
I'd say it depends on the person and I will give you 2 examples:
Michael Robinson, a guy that has been living and working in Spain since 1990 and has an obvious british accent even 30 years later
This youtuber that has been living in Spain for 3 years and speaks Spanish with almost no accent
EDIT: Just to clarify, everyone LOVES Michael Robinson, specially people who is interested in football (he was a  football player and since 1990 he is a football commentator), having an accent is not a problem at all
There was a fake rumour not long ago that he passed away due to coronavirus and everyone was devastated
The Spanish response has been perfect but one extra thing that should be said is the speed
Spanish people can speak incredibly fast
If you can reach that level you'll reach peak Spanish proficiency
In Spanish the standard neutral accent and grammar are not easy but neither impossible,with time it can be done but if you try and learn more specific accents from Spain, good luck my friend
The most difficult thing you will encounter are words with missing letter for no apparent reason and words that get added syllables to them
Never seen anyone nailing the ñ
Grammar has some tricky things
Then there’s the “to be” verb which has to different verbs in Spanish
Accent will be by far the most difficult, even more depending on the area
I did it when I was 14 so
Wait,did a british person just learned to speak spanish
Greeks are the only ones that can pass as Spanish, since their phonetics are so similar to ours
My mother speaks Italian because her father worked in Switzerland in the summers so she would go with her brothers and thus learned Italian,the only bad part is that she only knows how to speak it,not write it
I tried to learn the language because it's almost as important as English here in Mallorca and the sentence I will never forget is: "Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache"
_Spanish intensifies_
Like the southern accent
(I mean, any if the southern accents)
Well, in 2014 we had 236,669 brits living in Spain, I guess more than one learnt the language lol
I has a Greek guide when I visited Greece with my HS and I thought he was Spanish the first three days
That's true, many speak it perfectly
It's impressive
Italians, Portuguese and Romanians have a big advantatge
But it ultimately depends on the person, how perfectionist one is and the age they had when they moved to Spain
A kid from those countries that arrives before 12 years old will speak the language perfectly, no doubt
Totally true
It is amazing how well romanians speaks spanish, and how well they integrate in Spain
I have Romanian friends and they speak impeccable Spanish
I can only ever hear the faintest differences in some specific sounds, and very occasionnally
I often forget Spanish is not their mother tongue
The key word is living,not speaking Spanish lmao
It was the same for me
But italians sing a different melody when you speak, it's not the pronunciation but the entonation of the sentence (and that's why a lot of spaniards, men and women love italians, that "melody" is very pleasant to hear)
Unless you have been here for a really long time, we can hear your accent
Also the intonation is different
When I went to Greece, I always thought I was hearing Spanish around me (it wasn't)
In Portugal, it sounds like Portuguese
Yeah, italians are the ones having the easiest time pronouncing Spanish
And most of them sound nativelike, Laura Pausini is a good example, and I believe she learnt Spanish when she was already an adult and now she's part of tv shows in Spain like "The Voice" and she has almost no accent
Learning how to pronounce as a native:
Greeks, Italians > Portuguese, Romanians > The rest of the world
As a fun fact argentinians have a melody while speaking very similar to italians and there's a saying that says "Los argentinos son italianos que hablan español" both because of the way they speak and because they have a lot of italian blood
Weird
Even though in Spanish the expression that would be used in that sentence is 'década' (just like decade), I feel like 'tens of years' sounds better than decades in this case
I definitely thought that 'tens of years' was a very valid expression in English
There was a time when most of people in Europe worked 12 hours 6 days a week
As I see it, now, the technology let us produce much more than before
This is just my opinion, but I think we are producing too much and we are destroying our planet
This is one of the reasons why I believe is a good idea to reduce to 4 days, we can afford reduce our production and still living good enough while respect our  planet  home
Yes
There is still a lot of room for many companies to redistribute workload and benefits
It makes sense that with increase in productivity we should be able to make that more people can live better working less
That isn't very German of you
Add The muslim world too
Yes, of course
United Kingdom for inventing trains
I want to thank Australia, for being so pacient when people gets their name wrong and for the beautiful city of Vienna
Thank you France, our first constitution, that we're very proud of, was directly inspired by yours
I also think spanish cuisine has also benefited quite a lot from french Fame and culinary institutions (though It did have it's share of downsides)
Thank you England, though admitedly we may HATE It, you feed our tourism and therefore a Big chunk of our economy (just try NOT to be so disruptive pleaaase)
And thank you for all going to the same Monster resorts leaving some nice places behind
Thank you Portugal and Italy for defending our interests in the EU
We're much stronger together
Thank you France for your colaboration against ETA, a dark, confusing and frankly frightening period of our history
Thank you romania for all the people Who came here, i grew up eating sarmale
You're hardworking, upright  and amazing people
Thank you Portugal for being our brother
We might not always have gotten along but now we're there for each other in deer times, we absolutely LOVE you, though we won't show It
Thanks (West) Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Italy for creating the European union
Thanks to the UK and France for being such good frenemies
Thank you Finland for Linux
I'm not sure GNU would have been able to success without it
Germany and France for keeping Spain’s economy alive and going even with how awful our politicians are and how badly they manage this money
Germany and also France for leading the EU
Without them all us whiners would have taken down the whole thing
Thank you argentina for the wheat and thxs Mexico for being the only country with russia supporting a democratic government in the civil war
Thank you France for the revolution, the civil code and the metric system
And balconing
And helping us getting rid of Napoleon
Even tough they sacked the liberated cities worse than the French
>Italy and Spain for welcoming our immigrants in their countries and provide a home to millions of us looking for a better life
thank you for your sarmale and chiftele
I work in the UK and a few years ago went on a “company trip” to Spain
It was pretty much a lads holidays, but I got to see it from the other side
Bizarre to say the least
Only thank you to Spain and is "for being basically alright for the last 50 years". LMAO
I support Atlético de Madrid
Wow
Nice answer
We love you, Portugal
We should be closer to you and make Iberia great again
Sorry about Olivenza
Actually not
I understand much better French and specially Portuguese than Italian
I mean, I can get some words and sentence structure is pretty simmilar but a lot of things and nuances will be lost in translation I guess
I'd say the same about portuguese
&#x200B;
Here, a table about how similar romance language are between them
I understand written French/Italian/Portuguese pretty decently (I can't speak any of them, I only took some French in high school but that was already 8 years ago)
As for understanding then when spoken, it depends, Portuguese and Italian are doable, especially if spoken slowly, but French is more difficult
As for Romanian, I really can't understand a word
It doesn't even sound like a Romance language to me (no offense intended
Italians and spanish can get the most of casual conversation
Italy/Spain : no
Only a few loose words
NL/Afrikaans: kinda but very hard
Many difficult words are the same, but easy words/frases are completely different
NL/Germany: similar to NL/Afrikaans
I understand maybe 60% of written Italian and speaking slowly, clearly and with the help of the hands I can understand some spoken italian
Written portuguese is easier to understand than italian, however spoken portuguese is harder to understand than spoken italian
Yes
I understand italian, it's quite similar to spanish (or reverse)
It's funny because italian it's similar to catalan sometimes, not only spanish
Personally, Italian is a language that seems like you can understand everything
There are words however that are not so similar and you can only guess the meaning of it
Basically you understand half a sentence and guess the other
As a someone who speaks valencian (catalan), French is easy to understand
Specially written
Grammar is almost identical, words are similar
Problem is, if I don't know a word in French my brain will translate it to valencian instantly, which can work sometimes
I’m Spanish and pretty much understand Italian and Portuguese
I’m also Austrian and I understand Swiss German but Dutch only when it’s written or spoken very slowly
I also speak French (grew up there) and understand Québécois, Swiss, and Belgian French
imo French is the most similar in all the different regions and German varies the most from Switzerland to Northern Germany
Portuguese is definitely easier than Italian to learn for a Spaniard (maybe not for a Catalan native though) as we share more vocabulary
However, the pronounciation is another matter
Brazilian Portuguese is more understandable as they don't "eat" vowels and they're our Achilles' heel when\* learning languages
I speak catalan thats like a blend between spanish and french and i have a really easy time undersnanding italian, so much so that i have wached movies compleatelly italian and have been able to understand them fully
And we understand you better too
I had a Brazilian colleague and we used to talk in our own language without an issue but boy was it difficult with Portuguese
It also helps that most words are similar to Catalan or Spanish
At work I've talked with some portuguese clients, never had an issue understanding each other
I think it depends on where the spanish speaker is from
I'm a native Asturian speaker and it's surprissing how many words are closer to Portuguese than Spanish, including the pronunciation
For me it is not so dificult to understand them (if they don't speak too fast
Of course the same thing could apply even more for Gallego
Spanish has  very similar phonetic to Italian, so we can understand written and spoken Italian easily
Portuguese has a very much complex phonetic and the Iberian accent is strong, so for them Spanish is easier than the other way around
Brazilian Portuguese it's easier for us
But written both languages are so similar than any of us could understand 90% of any regular text in the other language
Spanish is also close to French, but again the phonetic is very different, so written is easier to understand, but much harder than Portuguese or italian
Have you Heard danish
It's said portuguese IS as danish IS to sweedish
We can read It ok, but the pronunciation IS just so weird the language becomes gibberish to our ears
Ans That's lame because It sounds amazing just very much non spanish
Of course if you get a bit trained or the portuguese slows down suddenly everything becomes clear
It has to do with the phonetical differences
Portuguese IS pronounced very differently from spanish, you have subtle vowel differences we just (5 vowel mortals) don't get and cut half the endings of your words
When we Talk It just sounds like horribly butchered portuguese asif someone was reading letter by letter, but when you Talk It sounds like some half drunk russian tried talking to you
For any nordic speaker, i've been told portuguese IS similar to danish, the grammar and lexicon are there, but the pronunciation IS
a tad imaginative
I wouldn't say your experience is the norm
Portuguese are better understanding Spanish but I have never had any problems understanding someone from Portugal if they want to
Also French and Italian can be understood if they speak slowly and want to be understood
Sorry, i know It isn't perfect but i just wanted to give the idea of what happens when a portuguese and a spanish try to speak in their own language
I don't know that much of either sweedish or danish, i've just been told it's a similar situation
I've also been told some portuguese aspects are shared such as the tendency to drop the endings of words
However it's definetely outside my expertise and even my competence level
Again, just wanted to give a general idea
There's also some more detail in our case
Gallician IS much Closer to portuguese so gallician speakers can understand portuguese even better
I know brazilian dialect is quite distinct and i'm not that sure how a portuguese would understand a murcian, a gaditano or a canarian as their accents are quite marked
In Spanish news currently I would say it's daily
Quite irritating to be honest
In catalan news I would say it's a bit less often since it's more regional focused and we have our own priorities like talking about a possible independence 24/7
Spain: it's constant, smth between hourly and weekly
And it's pretty infuriating, so many things we don't know about and we "HAVE" to know what trump last fuck up was
Everytime that Trump says some stupid shit
So everyday
well, it depends of a lot of things
Who is in the office and main things or statements (with trump is very easy you know ahahaha)
ongoing wars
riots
GDP
Sometimes they can be talking about the USA several times a day and sometimes 0 during some days in a row or not make it to the front page or headlines
usually how your country is portrayed rely directly in what we think about the thing the media is talking about more than in the way the media tells the news
and what about us in your news
What pisses me off is that we're on the verge of an armed conflict in the Mediterranean and virtually no one is talking about it because Trump saying some stupid shit, like he does literally every day, is apparently more important
I haven't heard about the escalation of tension between France, Greece and Turkey in television and big newspapers are mostly ignoring it too
One day we'll wake up to the sound of nukes and we won't know why
Read again
>because Trump saying some stupid shit, like he does literally every day, is apparently more important
You can't read or what
The last shenanigan was deflecting concern about climate change by blaming the fires on negligence by the Democrats
But we've been having way dumber things
Like the whole "injecting bleach" and UV light thing, the antifa "terrorists", Covid being a Chinese plot, etc
Literally no one here gives a shit, but the media keeps bringing us these irrelevant stories that do nothing but alienate us from what actually matters: that a hostile power is threatening peace in Europe once again, but this time everyone has nuclear missiles
Yes, since I did my exchange in Seoul, I could really saw how Europeans have way more in common that I thought before
How I could easily relate to any of the other Europeans but there was never any chemistry with the Americans/Asians since the cultural differences were too obvious
There were not many exchange students but we were a close core of Europeans with Spaniards, Italian, French, Finnish, Germans, Dutch, Romanian, Austrians
and we still remain close friends years ago
Some time ago I was lying in bed, thinking on what being "European" means
After thinking about it for several hours I came to realize one thing
European countries, for the throughout all their history have been fighting eachother nonstop, even tough most of the time they were fighting and dying for basically nothing
But, since the EU was created, those countries that literally were fighting eachoter some years ago are now
Working together
Protecting eachother, growing together
That was the moment I realised the importance of the EU, being european, and the european identity
As a Spaniard that has grown up in a capital city, studied abroad in a different European country (Belgium), and has spent the last decade in a third European country (the UK) I can't help but feel that there's more that unites us than that divides us
I've felt comfortable and at home in all three countries
Our differences, while obvious, are not deep enough for me to feel our societies are significantly different in respect to what matters most
Spending some time in the US was eye-opening
I felt that, while it was easy to get along with Americans, their core values and the way they see the world is worlds apart from us, and to me this highlighted the similarities among European nations in a way that I hadn't really thought about before
In Europe I feel Spanish
Outside of Europe, I feel Spanish AND European
Maybe the key of being European, what defines the European identity, is valuing the rich cultural diversity of our continent while understanding that we share the same core values, and working toghether to uphold those values
I must say, though, that this might not apply to all countries in Europe
I am pro-EU, but I think it needs to be adapted to the realities of the 21st century, and at the same time it needs to go back to its roots of solidarity and striving for the common good - the interests of banks can't be put ahead of the interests of the people ever again
Don't get me wrong, banks are necessary, and a healthy banking system is essential, but it has to be a banking system that works for the people too, not for itself only
Austerity was a mistake politically, socially, and most paradoxically, financially
Absolutely, I mean, of course a German and a Spaniard are different but people from the north of Spain and from the south are VERY different
I don't know if we will be a whole nation in the future but I feel proud of Europe, I like to be European and I want to be European
I pay taxes happy to help Europe and I'd pay more if needed
Spanish citizen usually look at our neighbors as a model so lot of us want to become a little more like all of you
It's important to note it seems nobody in Europe wants a war and historically it isn't so normal
I feel totally European
After reading the other comments, I realize that those who have an opinion closer to mine are the Germans, who have a territorial system similar to the Spanish and I think that allows us to better understand that multi-identity
In my day to day life, I identify myself with my hometown, even though I no longer live there, I still speak with their accent and carry out our small and particular traditions
When I am with other Andalusians, I feel identified by my province because there are many cultural and even language differences between them
And when I interact with someone from another part of Spain, I feel totally Andalusian
With each step of identity, the kinds of things that connect me to it grow
The things that make me feel European are the "big things" in life, and I don't feel less European for feeling Spanish or Andalusian, because what defines each of those identities is different, but compatible
The fucking crisis of 2008 has stopped European integration in its tracks (just look at the fact that we used to have a new treaty every few years, and now we don't)
I sincerely hope that it will be resumed sooner rather than later, because there are still many things we can improve together, without renouncing our national and regional identities
Even if we were to create a European federation we would not have to lose it, just look at the current federal states and their cultural diversity
The EU in itself is a supranational entity unlike anything that has gone before, and our future can be as well
Indeed, in [this video] you can see that through history, Europe was the battlefield of the world for around 2000 years, until EU came and stopped that
> Therefore I don't think that something like a European identity will ever come into existence instead of the more regionally shaped identities
Couldn't this be compared to the local identities vs the national one in Germany, Spain, Italy the UK
>Unless, of course, we'd have some "European nationbuilding" that aims at the abolishment of the regional identities
I think programs like Erasmus, increasing English proficiency, open borders, companies marketed at the EU specifically
can do nationbuilding without oppressing or forcing anybody
In fact, I think without migrant and financial crises that separate people, there's a strong chance a European identity would eventually form from the ground up without state intervention
> I view it the same as Indian or Chinese, they are both Asian identities
But within these countries there are dozens and dozens of ethnicities, languages and religions (less so with China since they've worked against it)
They're only an identity because people have been told so
Identities can and are often built
I don’t think so
The people I know don’t think like that at all
well all the people of south america seems familiar to me so it depends of the country
Depends on the day
Today here in London is a bit sad, mostly the weather, but I had a good jog in the park and I made friends with a puppy so I guess I am in a mild mood
Probably when I play some online game with friends after work it will improve
Thanks for thinking I’m a happy person, it is a positive view
Mozarts birth house in Salzburg, I get that you like the music, but the house itself is not that exiting
I would rather recommend to by a ticket to a concert of his work as there are many awesome musicians living in Salzburg
Also Salzburg in general is just flooded by tourists in the summer
Valencia is such a great city overshadowed by Barcelona
Most cities have everything you want when you think about making a trip in Spain, without the high prices that usually come with mass tourism
Barcelona is such a tourist trap with inflated prices
I'm not telling you not to go there, you will probably have a great time
But places like València or Zaragoza are really amazing and you won't find the same experience in a place like Barcelona
Edit: places that don't have that much to see compensate with more cultural events which usually involve nature, food, or popular events
They play with the experience of the tourist instead of relying on their tourist attractions
las fucking ramblas in Barcelona
And for that matter Barcelona in general
Lived there for a while and I must say there are soooooo many more beautiful cities in Spain
Although I guess Barcelona has a cool vibe
Pretty much every touristic destination here, because tourism itself ruined it
Also northern Spain is criminally underrated
Not implying they are bad, but overrated:
Barcelona and the rest of the Mediterranean coast (cities and beaches, Alicante, Málaga
Madrid (good, but not as outstanding as some people say, the same as Barcelona)
Balearic Islands (in terms of beaches and stuff)
Every tapas bar in the center of the spanish cities use to be a tourist trap
You have to search very good and ask locals to find hidden gems
Still lots of fun, though
Although tbh i didn't know germans liked cocaine so much
I mean, the actual point is the festival not the price of the beer
Wow, I hadn't ever heard of this
Looks like Benidorm or Lloret
I never went inside because we just stopped on the way, and when we got to the top it was closed, but the outisde + the view were very beautiful
I've heard the inside is nothing special though
While I agree with you, I don't think that Barcelona itself is  overrated, I mean it has very special stuff that you can only see there if you're into architecture
Gaudi & all the other modernist buildings are unique
Some places of bcn are tourist traps, but the rest are ok (but full of tourist anyway)
To each his own
I was born and raised in Valencia, I always found it provincial and narrow-minded
Moved to Barcelona almost two decades ago, not thinking of moving anytime soon and for sure not moving back
The cost of living in Barcelona is a pain the ass tho, especially renting a flat
Croatia is beautiful, cheap mostly chill and has pretty much nothing to complain about
I´ve been a few times in Istria and once in Zagreb and it was really great
I could only thing of the Plitvice lakes as overrates although that isn´t fair at all, they´re are super beautiful too, just way too crowded for that price
When I went to Liverpool I was amazed at having missed such a wonderful place, while having visited London several times
Totally agree, spread your tourism to smaller/less well known places, people
I will add something very specific to London: Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
Once I had relatives visiting me in London and they wanted to see it
It was a hot day in summer, it was crowded, couldn’t barely see anything, etc
It’s much worth it to go at a different time and enjoy the outside of the palace when it’s empty
I think the reason London gets so many tourists is exactly because it is not England at all
It is probably the most cultural diverse city in Europe and kind of the New York of here if you want to make a comparison
NY also tends to not be seen as the "real America" but people go to these cities because they´re so unique, massive and full of different cultures that it´s really amazing
Nahh, it's amazing
Been multiple times there, hope to visit again
Super fun and super busy
I understand anyone tired of tourism will hate it tho
I can imagine, I lived in Salzburg for some time
The tourists in the summer can be quite a lot
I don't know that one, but I am glad you had a great experience there
Barcelona is definitely not overrated, but there's much more to see apart of the main landmarks
Other places have less important stuff but they compensate with a good experience, like food, nature or some cultural/folkloric events
It's a really big problem and the police tries its best to help
They usually go incognito in public transports or in places where pickpocketing is common and try to catch them
It's not the most efficient method but some people I know got their stuff back because the police were looking around and catched a few of them
I'm studying tourism and it feels that it has much more variety in terms of things to do
It might be the same in Barcelona but its not so obvious as people tend to do the exact same stuff each time they visit it
Yeah that region is one of the hudden gems of andalucia
The white-washed villages region
Stereotypically andalusian and cheap
For a weekend is alright
specially if you go in spring and not in the summer
but idk after living there i ended up hating it hahaha
I lived in barcelona so yeah i've seen girona
Kinda charming
But not my favorite
It is nice but the thing is there's nothing important d
arround it (which is kind of what happens wuth barcelona)
I could see it as part of a road trip but a trip only to visit cartagena
I don't see it
Another place that has amazing roman architecture is Mérida, in the region of Extremadura
But it's also quite far away from any of the major tourist spots in spain
Extremadura has a lot of historic well preserved places but it's very rural
If you want your money's worth and see quite a few places without having to take a car then I'd say the best trips are:
Madrid, visit it and use it as a base to make day trips to the medieval cities of Toledo (kind of the historical and religious capital of spain), Segovia (which has a huge roya  castle and a roman aquaduct) and maybe Soria
Landing in madrid and doing the cordoba-seville-Granada trip using the high speed train (AVE)
The beach is also nearby if you want some of the famous spanish resort life
Spain is filled with them
I'd say pick a region and go there
The most popular one is the andalusian trinity: Cordoba, Seville and Granada
All of them amazingly charming and romantic
And also way cheaper than Barcelona
I like barcelona, it's a beautiful and fun city but tbh for me except for a few places looks kind of generic
I've been living in madrid (moved from barcelona)  for a while now and for me it's just more authentic
You know what I mean
i know about the mint thing
I'm reffering to the real thing
A LOT of it
I have
You brits like it a lot too
Spain, of course
In Spain it's common to just fight between ourselves, we don't need another country
But we have rivalry with France, but they ignore us just like we ignore Portugal
Historically either France or the UK
Why tf does everyone hate on France
Mayve I'm too young to understand but seriously wtf
Hello France !
What about the UK
Historically is probably the rivalry that makes more sense for Spain
Historically, yes, for some time
Nowadays most Spaniards care so little about Portugal we even forget we share a peninsula
Historical reasons, UK, Spain and France always shifting the balance of power before modern times
Plus Napoleon occupied Spain and established a client state
That rivalry and anecdotal bitterness somewhat survived
Historically it cames from Napoleon's invasion, Spaniards have been disliking France since that
(Pepe botella was our best king ever though)
Right, because you ignore us
They are too far away to have a real modern rivalry
Although some ultra nationalists hate UK and want Gibraltar back xD
Id say it's in the same level, in fact i remember talking with my dad about who did we hate more England or France, he said England i said France
Pd: Wasnt a really serious conversation don't worry
And Gibraltar, true
yes definitely France and UK
Love you Portugal
Because you're better at everything
But I love France, in fact, I study at a Lyçée in Spain (it's a french program to study everything in french following the same curriculum but not in France)
I can only say good things about our relationship with those countries
Actually Spain is the main defender of Human Rights in Venezuela and it's an actual debate here, it seems we care more about Cuba or Venezuela than Spain
Yeah, but don't take it as hate, it's just in our blood, we need to have something or someone to blame when something goes wrong
Leftists (rojos, mugrosos) blame rightists (fachas)
Northerners blame southerners (lazy people, they only sleep and live on benefits)
Catalans (lazis) blame Spain central government (opresores, fascistas)
And when we go out, we're doing poorly because of Germany, because of the Netherlands (this one is new, it's a new hated group created a week or 10 days ago), because of the euro, because of the wars against England (piratas) or France (gabachos)
Between brackets you can see only a tiny portion of the insults we have for each group
It's like a national hobby about how  much can you twist the reality to blame others
Mmm Spain has had wars with everyone so you'll probably find some spaniard that sees Portugal as a rival
But 90% of spaniards consider Portugal and Italy as brothers
Well, it's mostly because we've been in 18 wars against you
But you have to understand that Napoleon did one of the biggest betrayals ever, like what the fuck
Spain lets Napoleon's army march through Spain to attack Portugal and when they were in Madrid they decided to attack Madrid by surprise instead
Haha that was fucked up
Football and beheading kings is not a (very) big deal
There's no real hate by the way
We like to joke about it
Now a days not evem close, never heard of anyone hating on portuguese, on frenchs, or british, yes tons of times, portuguese, never, even historically we may have fougth each other from time to time, but i don't think we have ever considered each other rivals or enemies just sometimes circustances led us to figth between us
Well at least from my point of view, i ve always considered portuguese our brothers and i really love your country
There's a felling of brotherhood but also a feeling of superiority in some Spaniards and of nationalist reaction against that in some Portuguese
I've encountered both and both are extremely annoying
We have the same thing in Spain
France is like the cousin who is doing better than you and everybody in the family congratulates him and you deep down hate that
Another reason might be the 30 wars we have had against them in the last 500 years
Nope, I think this is the time where most Spaniards know better and enjoy Portugal
We don't give you that much attention cause you are not really the source of our troubles
And I agree, our rival is always something, somewhere or someone in Spain
>From what I understood it may have indirectly led to the Franco period
Not really
But one of the resons why Spaniards used to hate France and the allies is because they didn't help out during our civil war, so the Republican Army had to accept Soviet aid (in exchange for every single gram of gold located in Spain) in order not to get bukakked by the Francoist forces, the Italian Army and the Wehrmacht (which eventually, of course, it did, lealding to the Francoist dictatorship)
The remnants of the Republican Army then liberated Paris from the Nazis in WW2 and they thought that doing that would gave them the support they needed to push the Allies to overthrow Franco but nope, their names were erased from history
That's why the left hates France
The right does because of what you said, Napoleon and stuff (which is pretty ironic because our current royal family came from France)
Nowadays you may not realise it but your president angers foreign countries way too often
There's not much you can do about it for now tho
His last adventure was stealing a cargo of around 4 million masks that Spain and Italy bought from a Swiss company and happened to be passing through France
He agreed to return half of them, but that's obviously not enough to stop both Italy and Spain from losing their shit over it
Are we late to join the club
Sorry for that, Habsburgs were dickheads
Honestly, i can understand portuguese being untrustful on our country but i still really love Portugal, stay strong during this hard times
That last paragraph hit home
Right now the Socialist Party and a left-wing coalition are in office, and the opposition (Popular Party) is constantly criticizing them and acting as if they hadn't cut healthcare spending by 15-21 billion
With all this coronavirus crisis and how Portugal and portuguese politicoans are dealing with this you are making us impressed and the way we see you is improving a lot
I was in fact thinking of what happened with the opposition on Portugal, that's unthinkable in Spain our politicians are acting like monkeys figthing and throwing shit between them, some of them look like they are trying to make electoral propaganda out of people dying
why would i pass out in the shower if i can pass out in my bed
First time I hear this for showers
You guys drink too much xD
Every damn week
Wtf
How is it better than passing out on a bed
hahah
There actually is an asteroid whose orbit is crossing ours
But they said it'd just explode at the atmosphere
Sweet
London is a good location but its extremelly overpriced, you could see many other places of britain for the same price
Barcelona is also overpriced and overcrowded with tourists, just like costa del sol, valencia
i know those tourists just want beach and sun but you can go to cheaper places for that
Agree with everything you said
Basically all the fly -> shop -> Instagram -> 100% not fake authentic cultural immersion -> take 1 million pictures of tourist infested trap -> fly back and tell everybody
(In my opinion) this kind of tourism doesn't generate any wealth except for big business, promotes gentrification in its worst expression and drives rent above the clouds, ruins local life, spoils historical sites and is also unsustainable for the environment and smaller scale proximity economy
I think the same goes for most cruises and such
I mean, I see nothing wrong with wanting to go to the beach or anything, it's not what you visit, it's how you do it
I think that money isn't the answer here, you can travel cheap and not do those things at all
(As someone from Spain that has lived in Valencia I'm biased)
Tbh, Ibiza, Mallorca and Thailand are more than just party
Of course a lot of people go for party+beach but they also have some beautiful nature which are amazing tourist attractions, mostly visited by other type of tourists different from the party goers
Obviously Benidorm, I've only been there once even though I live nearby
Pretty rubishy and overcrouded
Barcelona is trash, Spain's strenght isn't it's cities but it's small lovely towns in the mountains or on the cost (Or both)
To be fair, there are only a few "modern" cities in Europe, that's something you find in the "new" world or emerging Asian countries
The only modern cities in Europe are those that were destroyed after WW2 or poor ones that boomed these past decades
My point is, they're not typically touristy to begin with
While I half-agree with you, Dubai also have the old town, with old buildings, that part was more interesting
But well, I only was there for one day, so I don't really had time to get bored of the artificial city
Mallorca is literally the best tourist destination you could want
It has everything; old rural towns, beautify mountains right by the sea, small recluded beaches, amazing natural sites,the old city underbelly, one of the oldest cathedrals in the world, I don’t really know how to say it but it’s just amazing in every regard; you should come visit, and even if you don’t like only partying you can do that too in q couple of concrete sites
Thailand is really cool, it has a lot more to offer apart from the party/beaches, personally I prefer Vietnam or even Campodia, but as a first experience traveling a sout-east Asian country on your own, thailand is really good
That's just not true at all
Biggest tourist group in Thailand are Chinese and people from the surrounding countries and they don't go there because of the beaches and party
You just put your own perspective and opinion (which is completely fine) but assumed that's reality
Of course there are places like Ko Samui which are beach paradise but there's a lot of cultural tourism in Thailand as well
concrete = cemento
This is a "[rape] you can eat it (the pronunciation is not the same as in English)
Molestar = to annoy, bother
To molest = well, not a nice thing
English - Spanish /
Carpet - Carpeta /
Rope - Ropa /
Billion - Billón /
Sane - Sano
French: sentir (to feel or to smell)
Catalan: sentir (to feel or to hear)
French: entendre (to hear)
Catalan: entendre (to understand)
Sensitive - Sensible
Sensible - Sensato
Left is English, Right Spanish
"Travesti" (almost spelled the same as "travesty") in Spanish means "transvestite". I'll save you some embarrassing anecdotes
I had somewhere a nice list of false friends between spanish and lithuanian, because they're not the typical languages you compare
I remember 2 right now
Bamba:
LT: belly button / ES: a kind of dance, slang for sportshoes
Aire:
ES: Air / LT: Irish woman
Polish-Spanish: Kurwa(b*tch)/curva (curve) and droga(road)/droga(drugs)
Spanish, Catalonian, Italian and Portuguese are very similar, so the list of "false friends" is huge (there must be hundreds)
Just some examples with Spanish and Italian:
| Spanish  | Meaning  | Italian  | Meaning  |
| salir | to go out  | salire  | to go up  |
|  subir | to go up  | subire  | to suffer  |
| sentir |  to feel | sentire  | to hear  |
| nudo  | knot  | nudo  | naked  |
We have [cajones] in Spanish and [whatever the fuck] Americans use cajones for
>droga
[Droga] means drug in Spanish
the english pedestrian and spanish pederasta are also one of the bad false friends
Rape in Spanish means monkfish
I dont think pastel is a word in english, cake maybe
I see, TIL
Thanks for the correction
I was primarily taught the "hearing" meaning
Havent seen that thing in my Life, u mean the color
Honestly, I love living in here and I've been living abroad and travelled all over the world
I live by the see in Catalonia very close to Barcelona so I also have the mountains a couple of hours away and everything is accessible .
I live in a nice area and I run my own business so moving wouldn't be possible either
I live in one of the safest countries in the world with very advanced laws in terms of equality and human rights, I have a social health system that's works well (could be better) and the weather comparing it to the 90% of the countries is amazing
Also the people is very open minded and friendly which is always a plus
I would like to see it prospering in other ways like jobwise for everyone in here but I'm very lucky in that aspect
I noticed how much I loved my country when I moved to another, concretely Germany
I don’t live in my country but I do like to live there, what I don’t want is to work there
For a software engineer Spain is just a place where you are heavily underpaid and as any other job in Spain your manager will treat you like a slave
I was sick of that culture, and in London I’m really happy about that
About living here, depends on the day haha but average is as good as in Spain
I love living here
Good quality of life, friendly and open society and social life, good weather, great food
Ive realized over time how lucky we are
I'm not happy in my country due to the salaries
It's too hard to find a good job with great career perspectives, and I would like to live in a country which has better job perspectives than Spain
I'm looking seriously to leave the country and I don't discard to do it as soon as I can
Yes, I like living here in Spain, the balance in life is good, but on the other hand I feel the political climate here is too much for me to live peacefully so I kinda want to move to northern countries, I value stability, can't get that here easily
I mean you can love your country and still think it is not a good place to live
Happens with me and Spain, although I left a few years ago and I´m probably never coming back
I would describe it (as I often do to other people) as one of the best countries in the world to go on holidays or spend a short period of time, but one of the worst to live long time
I love living in Spain for many reasons, but there are so many problems that sometimes I just want to erase it from existence with everyone aboard
It can feel helpless (unemployment/livable wages, toxic nationalism, corruption, false kindness, and a million more)
I've been abroad before and besides healthcare, the only things I truly missed were food and variety
Variety of everything
Languages, climates, cultures, architecture
And since I kind of need to be on the road often (the thing I love the most is nature/mountain sports/traveling) it provides me with everything I need
However inside Spain I really prefer the north to the south
I like the south, it's great, but the culture feels different to mine
Then , if employers keep smashing me as always and I find a good job elsewhere  I wouldn't hesitate to move again and come on holiday, because being able to rent a house without going broke is more important than nice beaches
The only country I think I would enjoy as much is France
Based on experience, they are closer to us than many think
I consider Italy to be a slightly more catholic and industrialised and less "balkanised" version of Spain with very similar problems and upsides
I would love to try out living in a microstate like singapore, liechestein, andorra
but for normal countrys, id like west germany or United Arab Emirates
Luka Dončić
Spaniard here who fell in love with Greece when i did an internship there two years ago
I wish we could trade places
I live in Bilbao, our weather could be better but I would not imagine living anywhere else
Would love to visit a lot of places, but in the end home is home
And the food
Not to say the food is bad in other places, but I can't live without my pintxos
I can't speak about The Netherlands, but as a Spaniard I lived in Germany for a couple of years and I was shocked with the conservative atmosphere
Public schools with religious names and teaching religion, lots of young people who were religious and felt kind of insulted when talking about being gay or lesbian
I was very surprised too because the Germans that I met generally thought that we Spaniards were more conservative than they are
I think that jere we've got the same feeling as you
We also get things later than the rest of Europe
It's always been like this, for centuries
I think that I agree with every pro and con that you mentioned
I would add that it also feels nice knowing that this is our corner of the world, it's pointing towards the Americas, but it's also attached to continental Europe, so even if we're alone, we're not isolated
Plus we've got each other
We're brothers
Maybe I could also say that global warming scares me quite a lot because some of out regions are already a bit arid, so the idea that we could go full desertic is frightening
But even once again, this peninsula is amazingly diverse when it comes to climate so
We're at the limit between Europe and Africa (and even have some enclaves in Africa)
We have coastal and hot weather in the south, good for agriculture and tourism
Wet cold weather in the north, good for amazing natural reserves
(Obviously these are the extremes as we have 4 seasons everywhere, except for
) Sub tropical weather in the Canary Islands for a nice stable temperature year-round
A large mountain area (second only to Norway in Europe, in absolute terms) which makes for beautiful landscape
The main 'drawback' is being in a peninsula
We are only connected to the European continent through France
We miss out on a lot of the multi-border fun "let's drive to Germany to buy gas
" because the country is quite large and it is a multi-hour drive to any border crossing
But then again, that also enabled us to avoid WWI and WWII destructions, and it depends on where you are personally
If you live in Tarifa, you are a 1h ferry away from Tangier, Morocco
If you live in Donosti, you're less than an hour away from Bayonne, France
In terms of international commerce, we are well positioned, with a lot of coast (being in a peninsula becomes a positive) and with ~~shared~~ jurisdiction over an important maritime spot (Strait of Gibraltar)
Overall, I like the latitude, the variety, being so close to Africa, having our own little Hawaii and being part of the Mediterranean Europe gang with Portugal, Italy and Greece
Non, France, tu n'est pas invitée.
I like spain's location (mediterranean + atlantic sea)
I like the peninsula i like the variety of climates (a bit of everything gives also a lot of variety to our cuisine and also allows many different cultures inside our country)
And idk, historycally speaking it has been mostly peaceful and stable borders (the oldest border in the world is between spain and andorra), the pyrenees are a great barrier
The european great plain always looked unprotected to me
I just love the variety in everything that spain provides
The perfect location
Borders are well defined and protected by natural barriers such as rivers and mountains
Major ports close to other Mediterranean countries like Italy or the North of Africa
Warm weather but with some rainy seasons
Isolated enough to be easy to defend
Some disadvantages though
A great country in the North which used to be far more developed than us and eventually just squashed us instantly
The borders are not close to the populated areas which made it difficult for new ideas to arrive in the country (only a few exceptions)
The entire country is elevated from the sea level and decreases the closer you go to the coasts and any transport infrastructure is more expensive to build than in a flat country
And the seasons can be brutal
A very sunny place can suddenly have a rainy season and all the rain that never fell in a year drops in a few days flooding everything
From Graz to Trieste there are 3 hours by car
That's just half an hour more than from my city to the sea
From Madrid it's 4 hours
For many people in countries with a coastline, going to the beach it's always a vacation
Well, I am from a country know by its beaches and the nearest one I have is about 4 hours by car
At least in Austria you have more rivers, lakes and mountain
Here, in the middle of nowhere, we don't have that, only 40 degrees in summer :)
Although if it wasn't for the internal political issues that weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, you could've benefitted from that plain at the expense of Russia instead of the opposite
From diversity comes chaos, but god damn is it worth it
It's such an amazing clash of worlds
>We also get things later than the rest of Europe
It's always been like this, for centuries
There was a saying some centuries ago "Africa starts in the pirinees". This is how far behind we were
Oh wow, that's harsh
i remember my history lesson once, my teacher said that in our industrialisation, which grew much later, England would sell us their old weaving machines, and they would use the more modern machines
That and all the protectionism we had for a while, and here we are, a first world country and yet still behind others
Portugal feels more of a neighbour than France
France feels different to Spain in many ways
Yet I rarely hear from Portugal which is weird
A part of Spain feels like parts of Southern France, yes, but other parts are quite similar to Portugal
North Region feels like Galicia and Alentejo and the Algarve feel like Andalusia and Extremadura
I seriously doubt you felt isolated between 1000 and 1450 considering the heavy involvement of the English monarchs in France (who were arguably French monarchs in England)
Or when the English king was also elector of Hannover in the Holy Roman Empire
I know, but that's a technicality
Portuguese, Italian, Greek and Spanish people are all ethnically / culturally similar in a way that France isn't. At least that's how I see it
But I was trying to be funny in a "you can't sit with us" way
Other European states had been centralising power around the monarch for centuries at the expense of the nobility
In Poland-Lithuania this wasn't the case, tho
Nobles still had a huge power
The king needed their approval to pass any kind of legislation and the nobles had to elect a new king everytime the old one died
This isn't bad in principle
In fact it seems like a more fair system compared to most of Europe, right
The PLC was the country in Europe with a bigger voting franchise at the time
In fact the system was officially called "Nobles' Democracy" and a "Republic presided by the king". The citizens had a lot of freedoms compared to other countries (like England with its Carta Magna) and even the first religious freedom legislation in Europe
However, this system was extremely dysfunctional for a number of reasons
First of all, every single noble had a right of veto in the Sejm (assembly)
One single vote could stop new legislation that had been being negotiated in the entire session
That is never good for a country
Another thing was there were a lot of people who had a say because even poor low nobles who had nothing more than their title could vote
They were very easy to bribe by high nobles
And this is, after all, nobility, and their factionalism was more about selfish interests and family rivalries than some political ideology on how to rule the country
And then you have to apply all this factionalism to the election of kings
Other kingdoms like Bohemia and Hungary were als technically elective monarchies, but their nobles almost always elected the heir of the previous monarch and that's it
That's undemocratic, of course, but primogeniture successions did help to consolidate power
Even then, it could've worked if the nobles had limited to choose someone from among themselves, like in their contemporary Italian republics
However, after the Jagellonian dynasty, that formed the union, died out, they started to frequently elect foreign kings like the prince of Transylvania (Hungarian vassal), a deposed king of Sweden and his children or various electors of Saxony
That is of course not good
Having a foreign king also irreversibly tied them to the politics and conflicts of their country of origin
In the midst of a war with Russia and an armistice with Sweden, a faction of the nobles elected the king of Sweden on their own and invited him to invade the country and war against his own cousin, beginning the Deluge that caused a very long-lasting damage and destruction
In the 18th century, the Saxon kings often disrespected Polish-Lithuanian liberties and the nobles rebelled and deposed them, but then those exiled kings invaded with allies to be reinstated
This weakened the PLC a lot and opened the gates for the partitions by Russia, Prussia and Austria
So as you can see there was a lot of conflict caused by succession
You could argue that the Deluge would've never happened if it wasn't for the elective monarchy or at least for electing foreign kings
Didn't it began because the king of Sweden claimed the Polish throne at the request of a faction of the Polish nobility, while the Lithuanian nobles were trying secession and during an ongoing war with Russia
It seems to me that the Polish-Lithuanian nobility was very responsible for the downfall of their country
They're also very family oriented, anyone else is an outsider
My aunt married into a family, so if i were to go there i would be part of the family, and not be treated as an outsider
In my families town they have two prices for food and drinks at bars and restaurant, the cheap one for them, and the overpriced one for tourists
It's very traditional
It has similar climate, similar architecture, similar economic activity, similar landscape, similar pottery tradition
I like history so I listen to podcasts/documentaries while getting work done for college
I also read about it online when I'm bored
Nothing really serious, though, I don't read academic essays nor anything like that so I take everything I know about history with a grain of salt
Yeah
Like Andalusia lol
Alentejo reminds me of the inner parts of Andalusia as well as Extremadura and maybe even La Mancha
Areas with little population as well, relatively impoverished and with huge extentions of farming fields of cork oaks, olive trees or dehesas/montados for cattle
Évora reminds me a lot of Extremaduran cities like Mérida or Cáceres
I'm sorry to be the dick but it's Written Andalucía
Not in English
Oh right
Moved to the UK when I was 18 to study a degree and four years later I consider it home
I go back to Spain a couple of times a year at least, and now I’m here spending the summer
My relationship with the UK is love/hate but so it is with Spain
At the end of the day, there’s no perfect place
I’m open to the idea of moving countries again :)
Sorry if I dont fit the question perfectly but Ill tell you why since I am planning to leave spain to never come back as soon as I can (probably USA or Canada with preference for Canada)
The political system is so fucked up in Spain, every single politician has so much shit and since you can be president more than 8 years here and there is not a single president but a whole party behind him politics have become a way to make money, its all a fucking way to make money and 60% of people getting 5000€/month salary are fucking useless and could be perfectly fired
Corruption is very real here in Spain
To make an example I know a dude that its part of a very big political party here (not even close to the president, but not a nobody either) and since he entered the party he has got 3 university degrees in 5 years (usually it takes 4 years to do one)
He hasnt said anything, but I see something weird there
I am so tired of the situation and I want to fucking leave ASAP
I believe public services should be available in all the official languages
If you want to talk to your doctor, teacher or local administrations in Luxembourgish you should be able to
Interesting
What part of Spain are you in
I dont know, honestly I havent investigated much, and there are too many states
All I know is from movies or things that I see around here, like texas is more from the right wing (I think) or new york is very expensive and stuff like that
I should have to take a look at it, but it would be mainly where I could get a job as my dream job (teacher) so pretty much anywhere
Also, I forgot to mention that since there are a lot of places of work here for the goverment in spain and its very difficult to fire someone from the public administration it is full of lazy ass workers that dont do their job and get a ton of excuses from the doctors (since the doctor is also free) like "my knee hurts doctor, give me permission for not going to work" and since the doctor cant prove that your knee doesnt hurt probably he will give it
And since its public you cant get fired, in a private administration if you dont go to work half of the year with cheap excuses you get fired and end of the story
Miami sounds good, but I was thinking more about teaching physics :) I can speak spanish perfectly, I have a very good vocabulary, I am very good at redactions and make 0 mistakes while writing, and (of course) a very good accent BUT I suck at syntax, how are spanish clases there
What do you study
Because I remember when I studied german we did a very basic level with almost 0 syntax and just learning words and some common phrases (this with 15 years) so if the level is like that then sure, but if its with lots of syntax then for sure I couldnt teach that haha
There are many, but the funniest I can think of right now is "mandar un tronco al aserradero" (to send a log to the sawmill)
Other ways I've heard:
* Plantar un pino (to plant a pine tree) this one could be easily the most commonly used in a funny way
* Liberar a willy (free willy)
* Calcular tu Producto interior bruto (to calculate your interior brute product)
* Liberar rehenes (to free hostages)
* Descomer (un-eat)
* Hornear un muffin (to bake a muffin)
Voy a lanzar un misil (I'm going to throw a missile)
Poner a Obama en la Casablanca (put Obama in the Whitehouse)
Voy a quitarme un peso de encima
plant a pine tree, free willy, drop ballast,  there's so many of them
we could probably achieve a list of over +30 ways of saying it
Visitar al señor Roca (Visiting Mr
Roca) as Roca is the name of a known bathroom supplier
'Plantar un Pino' (Plant a pine tree or plant a pinecone) in Spanish
"Mandar un fax" (to send a fax)
"Tener una reunión con el concejal". Having a meeting with councillor
This comes from a very well known brand of toilets and sinks (Roca), which shares a name with Marbella's exceedingly corrupt councillor of Urban planning (Juan Antonio Roca)
PIB es "Gross Domestic Product" o "GDP" en inglés
Ir a hablar con el señor Roca (go talk with Mr
[Roca]
"Ir a calentar el trono
To warm up the throne
I also heard that when you feel that when you need to take a dump you say that Jordan is peeking out through the ring (Jordan asoma por el aro)
"Echar un tordo/ñordo" (Take out a turd/ñurd
"Sacar a Obama de la Casa-blanca" (Take Obama out the Whitehouse)
one that keeps in my mind is
"Plantar un obama en la casa blanca"
Put an obama in the white house
A ver Chicago
Gross domestic product sounds like a good way to describe it
That's because Roca is the most popular maker of toilets
Yeah
Or "el perrete asoma el hocico" (little dog shows the snout)
ok i laughted  a lot with this
You're welcome
I know there were a lot of them in my region, specially in villages and mining towns, because the roads were really bad back then and they were pretty cheap and reliable offroaders
Here in Spain I think only the Lada Niva has had a bit of popularity, mainly on rural zones
The good ol’ Niva, that would be
My experince was discovering I wasn't supposed to express any kind of emotion on Denmark's public transport system
I swear, I was just talking with my friend and her danish girlfriend and I assume at some point we went full spaniard speaking but we tried not being too loud
I felt like if I had just pooped on the queens crown, so many hostile looks XD
But maybe the best example i wittnessed was this one:
An american friend's friend came to visit
Imagine the most stereotypical dude/bro frat guy ever: handsome, built, tall, freindly and overall very nice
We showed him the city and he loved the food
Everything was great
We decided to show him how Spain parties
The  **"that's not how we do things here"** moment began here
He started (as most foreigners not used to how much alcohol bartenders pour on drinks and how spanish party works ) drinking too much and too quickly and decided he wanted a girl
He started just being a bit too handsy and grinding against some girls
I've been to the US so I know that's how party-flirting works but arround here that is a huge no-no, girls will easily slap you, hard
And also it's considered creepy as fuck
We came to teh rescue and explained it to him
he's a nice dude so he apologized to the girls, it was tense though
seeing guiris getting really drunk at 11pm saturday night WFT
there are 8 hours ahead of us mate
Living in the US and having Brazilian friends you will get invited to cookouts and stuff
well imagine the surprise of me being the only person eating pizza with my hands
You could see the confusion in the eyes of each of all the brazilian families, and me being spanish, not understanding
and honestly 9:30 is being conservative
many times people have dinner at 10
This represents so much, lol
Are you kidding me
Thats insultingly early
21:30 is even a bit early
22:00-22:30 is common, and sometimes I go out for dinner at 23:30
Interesting
I'd say nowadays most people wear seatbelts in Spain (everyone I know does), but maybe it's because most people I know are my age and we have been taught to wear them
Personally I feel really uncomfortable when I'm not wearing it
everyone complains about how noisy we are but I'm currently sitting in a bus in Malaga right now and there's a group of Swedes basically shouting, if they don't stfu imma go yell helvete va jobbigt
In Spain it's common for the waiter to come the table to take your order, even in pubs
That sounds weird to me too as a Spaniard
See
In Spain would be like in Ireland
Go for rounds
Well well well, how the turntables
21:30 is spot on dinner time for me
22:00 is a bit late for my taste
However my lunches are usually way past 15:00, sometimes close to 16:00
I guess I have an even weirder meal schedule
21:30 I think it's the average time
22:00 is common for going out to eat tapas, and 23:30 while it isn't uncommon, it's late
Another thing would be to go out at 21:30 and ending your dinner still in the bar at 23:30
bruh when my friends and I meet for dinner we usually meet at 20
30 and i always thought it was a bit early but still not uncommon
You are not being rude
we are super noisy
If you ever travel to Madrid or Barcelona (or Spain in general), PLEASE enter a bar at like 23:00
you'll understand why we do that ahahaha
It's funny
On the one side I find people being extremely loud in public places (typically public transportation, restaurants, bars
) annoying, obviously
On the other hand, when I've travelled to other places in Europe, the extreme silence in these same places creep the fuck out of me
If I had to choose, I'd stick to the loudness, just because I'm used to it
But ideally it should be somewhere in the middle so at least it feels like you're not surrounded by dead people but not wild animals either
We Spanish really are loud
Personally I try to adapt to where I am, if people are loud then I'm loud if they're quiet I try not to make noise
And when I travel abroad and hear someone in public transport being loud, half of the times they're Spanish
It's a bit embarassing
That's not normal
At least in all the companies in which I've worked
It's normal to lunch for more time but not when you have a meeting after lunch just because the old style management appreciates people working long hours and it's simply impossible to keep focused for that amount of time so it becomes an incredible waste of time to do the same work
That's just how we do things: normally lunch is served at 13:30
14:00 and dinner at 21:30 on weekends and vacation lunch is at 15:00 and dinner at 22:00
in between we have a snack (called merienda but that's it)
It may be becasue we are a lot more outdoorsy
I've heard that it started because 14:00 is the hottest part of the day, so having lunch and siesta from 14:00 until around 16:00 kept workers out of the worst heat
There's my bro
I knew you wouldn't betray me
23:00-24:00
And yeah, it's kinda late
Don't ger me wrong, our schedule is more fun, Specially in the summer, but it is a bit fucked up
That's when I eat lunch in Spain
I tip for a good service, otherwise I don't. That's how it should be imo
Last time I went to Germany, I remember at least two places where there was a "tips are not included" in our receipt, which I found weird as while tipping is relatively common in Spain, I don't ever remember seeing one of those
I guess it is even more common there
How many people would you say don't tip
I think the same
I had to take the train weekly for some time
Some days the train was dead silent, other days it was dead silent but with two people loudly speaking so everyone in the train can hear all the conversation
And other days, when the train was packed, some people start to speak loudly and of course the rest have to do the same to be heard, and in the end it becomes hell on earth and it's a loudness competition
A middle ground where everyone speaks freely but without shouting would be perfect
But nobody is aware of this
Same here, in fact when I travelled to Vienna with my family my father was extremely pleased with how quiet everything was (he is quite the introvert so quietness and calmness really suits him), and my sister would start shouting everytime she opened her mouth
Everytime my father would have to remind her to lower her voice
Force of habit, I guess
I do enjoy not having to shout when I'm in a bar or a restaurant in other countries
Hey, I am from Spain, I agree with you, and I would think most people here would as well
I mean, this is not a situation where you have met to have a couple of drinks and you can arrive later or ask where they are, these are people waiting for you so you can move in and tell you how everything works and so on
In fact, one of my flatmates moved out and she did the same thing you just said, and me and her other flatmates thought it was very rude or
lazy on her part
Something like that
She is incredibly impunctual/unorganised by any kind of standard, though, so even though I like her a lot as a person I did expect something like that happening
So don't think what you saw would be that common in Spain: it's true we are way more chill with punctuality and schedules, but not showing up and not even calling or something at least
That's incredibly rude
Lunch is served at 14:00-15:30 where I live
Tbh the spanish mentality tend to be like "NOISE  IS  FUN "
Probably being used to noisy environments in bars, so you have to speak louder to be heard
It's not a thing I like and I tend to be self conscious about speaking volume, specially when I'm out there
But sometimes is complicated, some of my friends can be very loud
I don't think that's the norm in Spain
There are a bit of everything, of course
From 2-12 years old they start at 9:00
From 12-18 they start school at 8:00-9:00 or so
So most kids go to sleep at 10:00-11:00 depending on the dinner time
I've always found anglo saxon people obsessed with the children's sleeping time
Literally no one but the elderly and luttle kids take naps
I wish we could
But sadly the "siesta" stereotype is false and old haha
Dinner is between 21:30 and 22:00 so sleep time for most kids is 22:30 and for teenagers 23:00-24:00
19:00 is literally homework time and videogame time
I guess we are used to it
Here only the elderly go to bed that soon
I mean i've not gone to bed that early since I was in school haha
That could be the case, but he specified that he was *moving in* that day, so they will certainly at least have to wait for you because you have no way of entering the apartment, and they have to hand over your keys
I think not even at least calling them is a complete lack of social awareness, no matter the country you come from
Yup
We tend to use "Anglosaxon" as a shorthand for English-speaking people
True, should have added that it is mainly directed to English-speaking white people, with the exception of the Irish (never heard of anyone refering to them as such)
Dude, I'm talking about the use we Spaniards give to it, not the medieval Germanic people
It's like how sometimes "Latinos" is used to refer to Hispanoamerican and Lusoamerican peoples
The *fabulas* from Samaniego, tales about wolves and shepherds in general, traditional fairytales (fairies, monsters, etc
Most of them wouldn't adapt well to what kids are supposed to read now
Kids used to read internationally famous (dark) stories too: Esopo, Perrault, Andersen
Enriqueta Martí or 'La vampira del Raval' was a woman living in the 19th century Barcelona
She used to kidnap kids by offering them sweets, and once they were in her hands, she used to decide whether that kid was sold as an adoptive kid for a new family or the kid was murdered to sell its organs for magical treatments
She also used to conserve this kids organs in jars inside her house
Luckily she was finally captured and imprisoned
I mean Sánchez could put up a bit of a fight but he'd probably fail tbh
Our king is a young, tall dude
The Queen wouldn't stand a chance
Went to visit a friend in finland and we did with his friends the whole sauna + frozen lake thing in one of the friend's countryside house
They all found very funny that I didn't know we were supposed to just "chill" naked in the sauna
They were all "why did yiu bring a swimsuit
Idk it was weird for me to be naked arround strangers hahaha
I remember my first time in the UK
My pronountiation was bad so  every time I tried to say "cheers" as thank you, I said "cheese" and everyone laughed
hahahaha
At first I didn't want to take them out either but all the finnish guys were like "come on pussy, or we'll believe all spaniards are small down there" and I was like "Ok, you little shits
Now, this is enough
for my country's honor".
Tbh being naked arroun other dudes does create a bond
Tbh being naked with yoyr friends does create a bond hahaha
It was only weird for me because I was showung my balls like 4 hour after meeting them hahaha
I never belonged to my age range nor my country/region
My mom says I never behaved like a kid of my age
In the sense I never was naughty, I never took other people stuff, I was very clean (In the sense I was always washing my hands and stuff like that) I never had a rebellious phase, I never liked the culture the other teens liked (like rap music, or dumb action movies) etc
And also I do not fit the stereotypes of my region
I never liked parties, alcohol, loud places, I'm not funny, I don't enjoy food, I'm very "cold hearted" and shy
(I always felt I fit the scandinavian stereotypes in that sense, but I'm not saying I identify myself as scandinavian)
Definitely, I'm a quiet person and huge loner who loves peace and silence, staying in at home and such, the polar opossite of this country
I haven't lived abroad so this could change, but yes, i'm a bit strange and I've often felt like i don't belong
People have even told me right away that i don't seem/act spanish
i'll probably leave after finishing college, so i'll find out
I was even a bit worried when i  entered this sub, because i wasn't sure if my comments would represent my country
Getting drunk is extremely common for teenegers, and young adults (universities and such)
We used to have mega-botellones (massive public drinking meetings)
But after 30+ years it is not so common to get completely wasted
Everyone still drink beer, wine, mixed drinks, etc
Often with food or daily
But it not common to get totally wasted at that age
I guess it's similar to the US here, it's normal for the younger folk, but not something you'd see people in their 40s do
It's viewed as something to be proud of(at least here),people can be a little mean if you tell them you don't drink alcohol
Trashy
People drink with friends to have fun
If you get too drunk it is an embarrassment
Alcohol is normalized here in Spain
Most people drink moderately, but getting drunk isn't a taboo for teenagers and younger people, since most people start drinking by the age of 13 (you need to be 18+ to buy alcohol in Spain, but I'm not sure there's a minimum age for drinking alcohol, and alcoholic drinks are easy to get in places like Chinese stores even if you're underage)
Parents don't really care as long as they aren't directly affected by its consequences, especially in smaller towns, which often celebrate festivals throughout the summer, where teenagers and adults get really drunk and nobody cares
But won't you think that even in a botellón people don't try to get wasted, but to socialize through alcohol
Still bad in a botellón you don't want to be the one that is mega drunk and annoying
Happy to hear other Americans say this
I’m from Northern California and drinking to get drunk is pretty normal
No one bats an eye
My experience is just the opposite
People drink alcohol quite often, but you'll only see drunk people in parties for youngsters during the weekend
It's quite rare to see proper adults drunk in the street, an image I've often encountered traveling through other places in Europe
That's probably the reason why tourists from all ages who come to Spain from the North of Europe and drink heavily have always been seen as outrageous and a sort of cultural shock here
Might change from one place to another,thanks for giving your view anyway
Is there any statistic out there pointing to this
Drinking is mostly a social habit in Spain, you'll very rarely see a Spaniard drinking alone
Only related piece of news I've heard about domestic consumption of alcohol here was during the confinement, when apparently beer consumption escalated at homes
Children playing in the street
In some neighbourhoods in the 70-80s  traffic was so light that you could play football in the middle of the street, stopping the game to let some car pass from time to time
The "sharpener man". He used to go to the neighborhoods in city areas on his motorcycle/bicycle and blow a whistle with a particular nice sound so people could come to sharpen their knives, scissors or any sort of blade
Dressing all in black when a relative died
Nowadays your grief goes inside and you don't have to show it to the world
The "melon man". A guy selling melons on the street with a tune saying how amazing the melons are
"¡El melonero, señora
¡Melones dulces como el caramelo
¡El mejor melón de Villaconejos
¡Ha llegado el melonero, señora
Roughly translates as "The melon man, madam
Melons as sweet as candy
The best Villaconejos (a small town known for their amazing melons) melons
The melon man has come, madam
This guy still comes around my neighborhood (in Madrid) about twice per month
The "melon man". A guy selling melons on the street with a tune saying how amazing the melons are
"¡El melonero, señora
¡Melones dulces como el caramelo
¡El mejor melón de Villaconejos
¡Ha llegado el melonero, señora
Roughly translates as "The melon man, madam
Melons as sweet as candy
The best Villaconejos (a small town known for their amazing melons) melons
The melon man has come, madam
My cat really hated that whistle
And "El Sereno", some kind of watchman who wasnt a policeman, but was around the streets at night and had the keys to the buildings
He used to "sing" the hours
"Las 5 en punto y serenooooo"...thus the name (5 a.m. and "serene")
They used to be pretty authoritarian; my mother in law had a scolding from one everytime she was coming back home at "indecent" hours
>particular nice sound
Hell no it's annoying as hell lol
Edit: Might have something to do that the ones I encountered didn't have an actual flute, they just blasted the sound on extremely crappy speakers
Spain (at least where I live) is flooded with bidets, even nowadays
I haven't ever lived in a house/apartment without one
I like how they kinda trademarked that whistle
It'd wake me up in lazy weekend mornings and it won't annoy me at all :)
Yeah
Same in mine in Barcelona, he used to come every other weekend
Now with corona not so much though
[Here] you have
People used to say that when they came, it meant it was going to rain soon
In Spain there are not public toilets, either free or paid, in most of the cities
Nope
The closest thing I've seen is a graffity that reads "read the bible". And "bible" was crossed out and said "das kapital"
North Spain here, not as religious as South, but I never seen any
Not even on churches
I remember traveling through mid East in USA and being amused by some Catholic churches holding flags neat the altar, Vatican flag and U.S. flag
I've never seen such a thing
The closest thing were my Brazilian evangelist former neighbours, who failed at street proselytism for years
Yeah, I think I've seen at least one in Spain, but it's not like people pay much attention to billboards, even less to religious messages
I live in front of a catholic [neocatechumenal] parish
In all my years never been so agressive as some of the rallies i see in some US news
Can't deny there can be some in my country, but most i've seen are some evangelical talking very loud in the public transport like
three times in a decade
Religious billboards not really
Baroque art worked wonders for the Church in the times of the Counterreform though
Also, you can see tourism ads from Spanish cities promoting their own Holy Week processions (Easter but serious, for my non-Catholic fellows)
I don't think I've ever seen one in Spain
In London, I've seen some people (who seem to have some kind of mental illness) posted outside busy tube stations shouting about Jesus
Same in Spain
There is one in Dundee that says 'Jesus is looking for sinners', I guess he is looking in the right place
I've never seen billboards in London, but I've seen people shouting "the end is nigh
" and stuff about Jesus and sinners outside tube stations in the centre (Oxford Circus for example)
There are bible passages on big billboards along various accesses to Valencia from the Barcelona highway (V21)
I've seen a few others elsewhere too, but nothing as the monstrosity OP posted, and I can't find any pictures on Google
So, there are some, but it's nothing short of a rare sight really
South Spain here, sad to hear a northern friend perpetuating stereotypes
I've never seen any either
My apologies, but, can we blame our media
Spain has this too
At least 2 public broadcasting church channels and masses on public TV
Oh yes, we can
I speak catalan and Spanish so it's really easy to read Portuguese, French and Italian
I can understand some Romanian but it's difficult, reminds me of my Latin lessons in high school
We can read Portuguese very easily, then Italian, then French
A typical Spaniard could understand an article written in Italian and Portuguese, with French usually yes but not always
Romanian cannot be understood either spoken or written
Reading: Italian and Portuguese
Listening: Brazilian Portuguese is the only one I can understand even when it's spoken at a normal speed, Italian I can understand it when spoken slowly and clearly, and Portugal portuguese is the hardest to understand
Then you have French and Romanian that are impossible to unerstand even if spoken slowly (I can understand something if read though)
I'd say Portuguese, Italian and French are pretty easy to understand when written
French is the easiest if you also speak Catalan
sad Catalan noises
[Languages of Spain]
Well, depends on your High-school "path" but if you take liberal studies it is a mandatory course, or at least it was when I was studying in the mid/late 2000
I studied it for 2 years and had to take it as one of my "selectividad" exams (University Entrance Exam) to access University
Mind you, Spain is famous for changing the Education Laws every few years (or after every election /change of party) so it may have changed after the most recent law
Haha well if you bring in Catalan then that (and Galician) is certainly the easiest one to understand
Oh well, good to know
Thanks
Actually I really liked Latin because it helps you to find the root of many words not only in Spanish but in other Latin languages
Probably the laid back culture
We will never do things exactly by the plan, we will never understand why you need to be *exactly* on time, we won't break our backs for something that's not completely worth it, we value our "chill" time much more
Also the tapas culture
The eternal two Spains: two irreconcilable sides for everything
Also bars
Figthing between us and a more paused life style ( i mean drinking a lot and sleeping siesta)
USA- Sense of independence
It took me leaving the US to realize how important being independent and self-reliant is for us
It’s reflected in where we live, how we get around, how we work, how we communicate with and judge others
and it’s a lot of the reason why our government (in my view) is so ineffective when compared to other countries
If I believe that I should provide for myself, why would I accept aid from the government
Spain- Working to live, not living to work
At least I hope it stays like this
I don't know, things can change fast in a few generations
In Spain, name days were very popular in my parents generation and before (and even when I was a kid, they were still semi popular)
But nowadays kids don't celebrate them anymore, many of them don't even know the day
I used to bake bread at home and loved it, I can't resist the curiosity
Do you have any recipe of classic German bread that you can share with us
The only one I know is pumpernickel, it is a bit of an acquired taste but I loved making and eating it
Finding the roggenschrot was quite an adventure
Your message brought back so many memories :_)
I don't agree with that except with the tapas thing, that's not going to stop, not on my watch
Honestly I don't see what I said as bad
Carpe diem my dude
Does this bread have a name
If not I'll write it down as "Cantonarita bread" hahaha
I'll try it as soon as the lockdown baking fever ends and I can find yeast and flour again in the stores
It sounds like the kind I love, wholemeal flour, raisins, sunflower seeds, 70% hydration dough
The fine and coarse salt mix is just brilliant, I can't believe I never heard it before
Thank you so much
As /u/achauv1 has said, it's only that I disagree with you
But it's only opinion
BTW I'm from the South of Spain and there are a lot of people here that like punctuality and being formal
Papa asada
Bocadillos and croquetas for sure
Tortilla de patata
Maybe patatas bravas and "bocata de calamares" if you go to Madrid
I would say roasted chestnuts
Most of our traditional dishes are too elaborate, but these are typical food of like street market, mostly in winter
[Bocadillos] probably
Sandwich with baguette-style bread, and anything goes for filling
Tortilla, grilled/fried meat, jamón/cecina/chorizo
Roast chicken
If you ever don't feel like cooking you just go to the roast chicken store and get a chicken and fries for about 8€. Feeds a whole family
What about stroopwafle
That's like the thing I most often ate in street markets there, and I still miss fresh ones like those
We call that «choripan» here
I went to Palermo when I was 10 years old and boy do I miss arancini
Torrenos are also traditionals on my provinces how do you prepare them on Portugal
I didn't knew it was eaten outside
Yeah, I guess
I saw the picture and I thought of street food
I also ate tons of frikandelen there, they were crazy cheap in spar (20 per 1'8€), and times were tough then
Im from Soria, we don't prepare them that way but ye close enough, thougth we are a little bit picky with them because outside Soria it's almost imposible to find decent torrenos, i hope portugues torrenos can make the difference
Yes its like those ones (thougth they are a good example of torrwnos out of Sorian ain't good torrenos because that looks correoso as fuck, and well im not gonna start on it or this comment will estend way too much
It is associated with being right-wing (except if the football team is playing)
Here if someone has a flag they are probably extremely right winged
Not particularly odd though some people will definitely judge you if you do
It's uncommon but I've seen a surge in the amount of flags people have due to things like the catalonia independence thing when it was starting and was much more widespread on the news
Personally its not odd for me
I've seen people that salute the flag and put the national anthem and that's definitely weird
Having or displaying the flag carries a tremendous stigma from Franco times when national symbols were abused and that tainted them to this day
We Spanish people are not good at moving on from troubled past events
Having one is acceptable for sports events
It's also common for Spanish students studying abroad to get it signed by their international friends as the end of their experience is near, as a goodbye souvenir
Displaying it has always being a big no-no and you would've been called a fascist if you did (in Spain you get called fascist if you're not left-wing, it's the "cool" thing nowadays)
However since the Catalonia stuff started a few years ago many people all over the country displayed their flags on their balconies and windows as a counter movement and a portion of them still remain today
Back then it would've been unthinkable to see random flags displayed by people
You also see them at the 20:00 applause
I never had one, but I knew people who did
Its not weird to have a flag in Canada, like it is in Spain, but it's not THAT common either
Here you would be addociated with the right wing parties
In my country it usually has conservative/fascist connotations
I think it was somewhat rare in Spain a few years ago, but recently it has become much more common as a response to Catalonian separatism
Which is kinda scary, because spanish "national pride" has certain
Connotations
Basically, 90% of the people who wear the flag as part of their clothing or hang the flag outside their window are right wing conservatives and nationalists
Which is pretty fucking worrysome, imho
Yes, because it remembers to Franco's time
But with time I suppose no
Well depends on the region
You might be seen as a fascist and in some situations you might even be attacked for displaying the spanish flag
A cyclist from southern spain was pushed off his bike catalans in the middle an amateur competition for wearing something with spanish flags for instance,
Here most people have one, if you dont have one it doesn´t really matter and its mostly used in events like football matches ,festivities or parades
Here in spain they call you a "facha" (like an extreme democrat) if you have one, nacionalism is seen very bad in spain, if you love your country, a lot of people assume you are a racist, homophobe etc
Which is really wrong
I’m socialist and I have it
I have the flag hanging on my house’s porch and I’m socialist
People need to grow up
The national symbol represents the nation, if you just allow the right wing to display it you could assume wrongly that is just a right wing thing
Also the left in Spain is socialist moderate while the right is wild and full of hatred so no wonder why the cool thing is to be leftist
People just want to live in peace (something quite opposite to what at least the leaders of the right wing say they want)
That's exactly what happens in Spain
Personally, I think it's a bad idea to tie yourself to a country you aren't in charge of
I don't feel particularly patriotic to either of my countries; they're just the places I've lived, nothing more
> I have the flag hanging on my house’s porch and I’m socialist
People need to grow up
The national symbol represents the nation, if you just allow the right wing to display it you could assume wrongly that is just a right wing thing
Desgraciadamente la realidad es que eso significa que eres "el facha del barrio".
A mí personalmente el tema me da bastante igual porque nunca he sido patriótico ni he tenido apego a símbolos nacionales
Pero tampoco me va a dar sarpullidos la bandera como a otros muchos
> Also the left in Spain is socialist moderate while the right is wild and full of hatred so no wonder why the cool thing is to be leftist
People just want to live in peace (something quite opposite to what at least the leaders of the right wing say they want)
Comentario parcial del día :) Tu PSOE está igual de lleno de locazos que la derecha, a la cabeza el inútil que tenemos de presidente del gobierno
Y si nos vamos a los extremos, de cualquier bando, ni te cuento
That was the case way before Vox even existed
In fact, one of the reasons that extreme right populist party came to be was precisely the far and moderate leftists claiming moral supremacy
Textbook example of reactonist countermovement
I live in the UK
I would say that we should keep writing in English just to make it easy for everyone (so they can know what we are discussing)
About “the neighbourhood’s fascist” I don’t care, I just like the flag, I like the dutch and german flag as well and I use to have them as well but during one storm they “flight to the moon” and I found a new spanish one at the newspapers store
About “your PSOE” it is not mine, if it would, it would be socialist
I’m socialist, PSOE is socialist in name only
Ok, I see what you mean
But I still don't see agree with your position that in Spain the left is socialist moderate and the right is wild and full of hatred
I think both sides are full of hateful, unreasonable, extremist crazies
Anyway, there's no point discussing this I guess
this one
Everyone has seen it
Not me though
Agree, I was about to post the same photo
I was thinking the same
I agree, the other one I've seen posted recently is [Marina Ginestà] by [Juan Guzmán] ([info]
i thought of this one, for a more modern take
The attempt at coup d'etat by Tejero
Strange, Never seen It
Never saw it
That's like on wvery spanish history book hahaha
Why
It's the spanish civil war
I'm actually crying
That's amazing
TIL Robert Capa was born Endre Ernő Friedmann in Budapest
The terrible quality of buildings built between 1985 and 2005
Cold in winter, hellish hot in summer, bad acoustic insulation, gotele, bad draining, humidities
Spain
Our politicians are subpar in every way, always fighting, stealing, separating and dividing us to gain more power and corruption
It's disgusting, a lot of us are sick of it and it makes me lose faith in the system
the lack of job opportunities for young people and/or recent graduates
We are living worse than our parents at the same age
Long stupid burocracy with everything related to my business but it could be for anything related to talking or dealing with the administration which makes it a struggle
Their websites are outdated, slow and not user friendly and to make them work is a continuous hassle
The process to create a business is one of the longest in Europe which discourages it and any mistake on your part (for lack of assessment most of the time) is hugely punished
im asthmathic so i agree on this one
I have lived in many cities in Europe and this happens all the time
Big companies tent to concentrate all in the same cities to have their suppliers/clients close
Don't get anxious about it, there will always be shitty appartments to share on the surroundings where you will meet wonderful people, and you will be able to move closer to the city center as soon you start earning some
Beginings are always hard but if you manage to adapt without falling into depression, when time pass and you look behind you will feel proud of yourself

Hello, brother
You can get unlimited data for a bit more than that in Spain
Same here and the disdain of some people towards students, like studying doesn't demand a serious effort unlike working in a factory or in construction
The fucking humidities never disappear
This, lot of people has lost faith in change or improve anything and with good reason
Same hahaha
gotele is like drip painting, like drops of paint thrown against the wall to hide falses, I hate it and every building has that and it's a nightmare to get it off
Yeah that's true, no job deserves to put your integrity at risk so avoiding dangerous areas should be a must
I hope you the best luck
Advices are meant to be useful, your alternative is just rant, maybe justified, but totally useless
>most people I know can't get away from renting because property prices are so high
The same problem here, I just decided to buy a cheap house because I realized that I couldn't make any savings for a good one if I continued renting
My life quality has decreased but I am saving money at a much faster pace and I know in a few years I will sell this crap and buy something better
the more similar thing that happened whats the anouncement of the death of Francisco Franco
the message
&#x200B;
edit: ok, i understand it wrong hehe sorry, the more similar would be the anouncement of the 11-M or the 11-S but as im spanish im going to choose the 11-M
Also the execution of ETA of the young PP politician that changed how Eta was view
Spain it is not affected by world wars, but
The effects of Spanish civil war is huge in our society
The country is still divided into two sides and the civil war is mentioned daily in politics
You can see the physical and human concecuences in a lot of towns
Totally agree
DO IT
One of the things I liked most was the constant feeling of "man, it did happen things here".
Sorry, no refunds
Yes, the @ (arroba)  A weight/mass unit
(also used by Portugal and some countries in South America)
&#x200B;
The wikipedia English article is not very good, [ because the arroba is not a "fixed" unit it changes its definition in every spanish region (in some places is 12,5 Kg, in others 10,4 Kg, etc
Not traditional, but in Spain we use commonly the "soccer field" unit for big area measures, specially in the media
It's a little weird, but it's a good way to mentally visualize how big some things really are
For example, if you read that 84
000 hectares of woods were burned in wildfires in 2019 you know it's a lot, but then usually the news add: "that is equivalent to almost 60
000 football fields" and then you visualize better how ridiculously big that is
in rural areas there were probably all kinds of local units of measurements
Just in Galicia we had "ferrados" for parcels, among many others
But nobody under 70 uses them lol
Spanish Media metrics:
- Area: football field
- Volume: olympic swimmung pool
- Cost: CrstianoRonaldos
One CristianoRonaldo is 96 million Euros
I'd add fanegas which is still used to mesure your land in the countryside
Funny thing, it can be used to mesure length or capacity
[fanega]
Also, *quintal* (100 kg nowadays)
Wrong, 1 quintal are 100 castillian pounds, around 46 kg
That's why I said "nowadays", because nowadays we use the metric quintal, not the old quintal
How complicated :/
There should be a list only for Italy, and another one for the rest of Europe
My pick:
Alhambra
Tour Eiffel
Coliseum
Pompeii
Neuschwanstein
Acropolis of Athens
Wieliczka salt mine
I think It would be more interesting to Talk about man made or natural
because there are many Who are ambiguous and Seven IS such a low number
I used to hate wine even though I live right next to a major wine producer area
Now I love it
I also used to hate flamenco because I fell for the stereotype there was for a long time that flamenco was tacky and dated, something either for tourists or conservative people
Other traditional genres like copla too but also a lot of mainstream pop Spanish music
I had a very edgy phase regarding music
Now I love Spanish music, both contemporary and old
The Valencian
When I was little I didn't see the sense to learn it because I practically didn't use it, I only spoke Spanish
I know how to speak it, but now I like to discover more about its vocabulary and its speech, although Valencian and Catalan are sometimes a topic of discussion
I prefer not to get involved in that subject and simply learn the way in which it is spoken in some areas of the Valencian Community, at the same time that I learn the Valencian the schools teach
for me its the not-being-on-time mentality LOL
Also  i hated all flamenco when i was younger, but now i found a few flamenco guitarists that are nice
I still dislike most flamenco tho
Theres also a huge sense of entitledment in a lot of the population here i feel
I didn't like the flamenco, but now I appreciate it
Flamenco music
I used to hate it as I saw it as a boring and quite annoying music genre
Nowadays, it’s not that I love it, but I’ve seen all that is behind: the art, the guitar playing style and its dance, its wide influence on the Spanish culture
It’s impressive that a music genre practiced by such a few amount of people has influenced a whole country and defined it internationally
PS: when something clicked in me was when I saw it live with dancers
That’s an experience to live
My polish mom forced me to skip the not-being-on-time mentality, now I always arrive to places 5 minutes earlier and wait half an hour for the rest to come
Probably the British chain Leon
It's varied and the food was better than expected
Madrid reporting: they're too expensive lol
They're nice but you can get a better presentation for the same price
Burgers, wraps, chicken and rice dishes, chicken wings
Seems like they've changed the menu since the time I went (the only one in Spain if remains, Gran Canaria airport)
I have heard gmail used, but i don't personally use it
Here we had a lot of local email providers before gmail was popular
So we use email
We still use e-mail in conversations, because several people that use Outlook or coorporate emails, from their working company
I think it's just the use of an isolated English word in countries where that language is not native
As you wouldn't use mail for snail mail because you have your own language for that, and if e-mail became a common word even when speaking in your mother tongue, mail is a natural evolution to simplify the loan word
Yeah me neither
Some people in this post are trying to explain the term Gmail not taking over because some people use other emailing software
But I don't think that's it
At the end of the day the vast majority of the people do use Gmail
The reason, in my opinion, is that emails have been a thing for many more years than Gmail, so the concept is so built in our vocabulary that it just isn't going to be replaced by a brand just because it's popular
And yeah in Spain we mostly just say *correo* (in my experience very few people add *electrónico*) and sometimes email
Never just mail though
Feliz cake day
As a guy who usually emails, I use mail, email and correo altogether depending on who I am talking to
Mail and email for work, correo for personal stuff
France
Germany
Italy
Portugal
EDIT 2: REVISED VERSION, REVENGE OF THE LIST
France
Italy
Portugal
Morocco/Germany
Probably actually studying history would yield Portugal much higher on the list, but as we tend not to study much of what happened between Portugal and Spain, I can't say for sure
In my history classes I've learnt much more about the other four countries
Edit: this is sparking a very interesting discussion, so to have a more nuanced version of the list y'all should look at the comments
Portugal
France
A Latin American country like Mexico
Holy Roman Empire (not the unified Germany)
Morocco or the Netherlands
Portugal
France
Arab Caliphate (because of Al-Andalus and all that)
England
United States
1/Italy: especially the Roman empire, but the Italian wars also feature a lot
Half of Italy was under Spanish control for a extended period of time
then you have royal links (like Amadeo de Saboya) and Mussolini appears in the civil war
2/Portugal: again, part of Spain at one point
But also there's a lot of common history with the reconquista and the Roman conquest
3/France: we've been battling and marrying France for centuries
There's also that time they invaded us
4/UK/Cuba: we have a long history with the UK too
From the early days as allies of castille to the Napoleonic wars
Cuba was one of the last colonies we lost and also one of the first we had
It was also pretty important so you'll hear about it
5/Mexico/the Benelux: it was probably the most prominent of the colonies, so I reckon it will appear from time to time
The Benelux was part of the Spanish crown for a lot of time, so expect to learn extensively about their early modern period
The Netherlands was also a bitter rival
when we weren't at war with them
Honorific mention to Morocco, which probably should be higher up the list
1-Portugal
2-France
mexico
4-Austria
5-North Africa in general
France
British Empire
New Spain territories after independence
Portugal
Italy
I'm counting history starting at the unification of Castilla and Aragón since before then it wasn't yet Spain
Otherwise I would've put Rome and Carthage on the list
I'm surprised to be the second, as far as I've studied this year (which is 1874, we have to learn the whole history of Spain from paleolithic to Pedro Sánchez) the only interactions I can remember are the hispania period (~200bc-~700ac) and the short period were Amadeo of Saboya ruled (1871-1873) but nothing else, what am I missing
IMO or should be something like this:
Portugal
France
Italy
Morocco
I think Germany's influence wasn't as lasting as the others mentioned above
Not a single Latin American country
If you refer from actual relevance in our history i would say
1-Austria
2-France
Otomans
4-North africa
5-Portugal
IIRC "arigato" is a Japanese word that comes from "obrigado". So there were  relations with Japan
Edit: I stand corrected, it seems it's just not true at all
Thank you for the correction
I think Austria would be a better fit that Germany tbh
We are talking about which other 5 countries would they learn the most
It would depend on where do we draw the line that defines "Spain". I took it to the broadest sense, which would mean about 300 years of shared history with most Latin American countries, since 1500 until most of them achieved independence around the 1800, but way more with other European countries If we are talking about right after the fall of the Roman Empire, where we tend to start when talking about "History of Spain" in highschool, it would mean 1500 years of shared history
Moreover, most Latin American countries have a lot of history before the Spanish conquest that people would know nothing about were they to learn about our history alone, they probably would learn more about other European powers, don't you think
It sucks but our school curriculum kinda stops at "Columbus <<discovered>> America" and never goes beyond that until the XIX century and the loss of the colonies
So not really
I'm not a historian but I think knowing more about our history would catapult all our colonies, Portugal and Italy to the top spots
The Netherlands, but especially Belgium might climb a lot aswell
That's what I'm saying, that if I knew more about my actual country's history, probably Portugal would be higher up on the list, but the image I have of my country's history ends up with that list
There are probably more historical links that I don't know of with Portugal, but I can't say for sure because my knowledge there is pretty limited because of what I was taught in school, so I can't make the list based upon those presuppositions
Yes, but we can only say 5
The countries that I said had a lot of importance for Spain
Being participants of important moments with huge repercussions in the history of Spain
Now I remember, but the only mention about it in my book was just that there was a conflict with france over the duchy of Milan, didn't know it was this big, thanks
Definitely but I still would put it in 6th place though
I think that when you study Spanish history you learn a lot about the Aztecs and the Incas as most foreign sources of information about these civilizations come from Spanish explorers and missionaries
You learn about Colombus, Cortés and Pizarro that are three of the most important figures of American History
If you study deeper you basically study the origin of Latin America up to the war of independence
If you take Germany for instance, you will only learn something about how king Charles the first of Spain was also Charles the fifth of Germany, and how he let the empire to his brother Ferdinand while giving Spain to his son
You won't heard much more about Germany until the thirty years war and then how Hitler helped Franco win the civil war
Those are just small parts of the German history, nothing if you compare it with how much you learn about Mexico, from the Aztecs up to the independence
Yeah, Morocco should be higher
I partly disagree
The fact that most sources of information come from Spanish sources does not mean that actually studying Spanish history would mean you learn more about it
Again, maybe if I were a historian I would disagree, but what we learn about our own history is certainly more about Europe than about Latin America
The fact that the part of history in which we come into the picture is very important doesn't mean that is bigger than other parts of other countries' history
It's true that probably Germany should be a bit more down the list though
How odd, in Madrid we devoted a lot of time to studying WWII
The syllabus is slightly different from region to region, though, isn't it
Yes, and report youtubers who advertise them
Not to mention that we know gambling addiction is a thing
Even if the kid does not have access to a payment method at the moment, it is probably something we don't want to have unregulated
And although I'm not in the business to ban things for adults, I would like for it to have mechanism to help adults that request it
An example would be the ability for an adult to opt-out of all digitally based gambling system
They can opt-in if they want, but with a 24h delay
My dumbass read Eurovision and I was confused with the comments of the post
Me too
I don't know, I wish that would happen, but my country has gone through this situation several times in our history and they just expanded the cities
Our rural areas are in a pretty bad situation right now, with lots of problems regarding access to healthcare, public transportation, phone signal, banks
Climate change will be a nightmare for all of us
Most of Spain already has problems with droughts in summer, for example, and they will get worse
The weather will also become way harder to predict for everyone and European agriculture in general will face new challenges
We'll probably lose a lot of our biodiversity too, although we don't really have that much left to begin with
r/Yurop together strong
You may not need access to your bank, but all the old people that barely know how to use a smartphone definitely do
Most of them can't drive because they're too old, so they have a hard time trying to get money from their accounts
I guess that will change in the future, when credit cards and phones become the usual method of payment, but right now this is a problem
If we remain disorganized and separated the global superpowers will devour us
China is already buying the black sea and the other poor countries of the mediterranean
me too, if im in algeria I will identify as european, if im in europe I will identify as north african and if im in the USA i will identify as a mexican
I feel like a similar thing happens in Spain
A lot of people see patriotism as a negative thing here and associate it with fascism, which leads people to feel more comfortable with being part of Europe as a whole
The only one I can think of is one where a low poly T-rex is dancing in a white background while a text to speech voice says "Help me I'm fainting, shut up you lesbian old man"
I don't know if it counts, but pokemon memes r a big thing here
They make me believe in my country again
In Spain we have our own reddit (forocoches) and yes, and a shit ton of them
This format with Julio Iglesias
It refers to Julio’s reputation of sleeping with thousand of women and getting their pregnant just by looking at them
Here in Spain left wing people use a picture that shows the [car ] of Carrero Blanco successor of Franco being blowing up by ETA
Also the ones about Españita
Also the ones with Rajoy running
La verdad es difícil que hayan memes únicamente españoles (no sobre el propio país) porque la mayoría son o ampliamente usados en Hispanoamérica o directamente de origen hispanoamericano (mucho texto, lo sé)
Can't believe you've just compared Reddit to Forocoches
Reddit's equivalent has been Menéame for years, Forocoches is like the gates of hell are open now
My understanding is it's more like 4chan: unmoderated, lots of reactionary content, etc
Do you know, did it start as just a forum for car enthusiasts as the name implies
Esos están tan arriba que se man pasao
Yeah but I think that every country has memes about their politicians
Ya, aunque ahora que me pongo a pensar están los memes como "Murcia no existe" y los típicos de reírse de la manera e decir las cosas del resto e comunidades
We know that feeling bro
More like a brother I'd say a family, Italy
But then I remember Germany, France and Portugal (even tough we tease last two a lot, we love them)
It will be Turkey for me
There is some kind of instant connection when I meet Turkish people
I think it's because of the Mediterranean Sea maybe
I'd say Portugal is our little brother, Italy the brother about the same age and France is the oldest brother that is doing good in life and you respect and love but kind of hate that they're doing better than you at the same time
It's curious how you don't mention eastern countries
Sssssh don't say that too high or UK would be mad
We've been in the same places at the same time: reconquista, empire, dictatorships
Portugal and Spain follow the same path it seems
Still I think Portugal's best friend would be England
Well Western Europe, say hi to Spain, Portugal and Italy
Mediterranean boys
And very proud of it
Italy is def like the cool cousin you see once in a while but when you do, you can expect it´s gonna be a cool night
Would you say that Germany sees Spain as anything than those lazy southerners
I have talk (in person) with many German people, but all of them said they liked Spain one way or other
We share a lot of history and culture and we even shared -some- territory during Charles V rule
Also immigration we're having from Germany and viceversa (not to talk you've unofficially conquered at least two Balearic islands :P )
It's in Extremadura, take it hardly anyone will notice lmao
Yeah, i'd say Italy IS our cool cousin
Portugal IS our brother though
We've gone through much of the same shit together and we're Closer that we like to admit
Northerner living in Germany here, let me answer that question: *No*.
If you want all of Extremadura just give them some trainstations and roads and they'll be joining you for sure, we sadly don't take good care of the extremeños
It's funny because is true
If germans had won probably that pilot could use german for his questions, but they don't
How mutually intelligible are romance languages (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Romanian, Catalan) Let's try it posting in our own language
Spanish:
Bien, el objetivo de este hilo es ver si verdaderamente podríamos entendernos sin ningún problema entre hablantes de derivados del latín sin usar el inglés como lengua
La idea es que cada uno haga un comentario en su propio idioma y gente que hable otros idiomas conteste qué % del comentario ha logrado comprender
El primero es obviamente este comentario ¿cuánto habéis logrado comprender de lo que yo he escrito
The thing is that latin languages are a dialect continuum
They are more mutually intelligible the closer they are
Something like this:
Portuguese- -》Galician --》Spanish --》Catalan --》occitan-southern French --》northern French --》wallon
Occitan --》northern italian --》southern Italian --》Romanian
Jo diria que prou, però més en l'àmbit escrit que a l'oral, la fonètica varia molt
És clar que aquells que parlem més d'una llengua romanç tenim advantages davant dels monolingües
Amb el valencià (cat), aprendre el francès per exemple m'ha suposat un repte molt més xicotet que si haguera parlat només el castellà.
El castellà és la meua llengua materna, però sempre que he viscut en una terra on es parla una altra llengua o dialecte he tractat d'aprendre-la, perquè crec que el multilingüisme és riquesa
Me hacía ilusión participar, decirlo en castellano era hacer un poco de trampa
Yo el castellà (o espanyol) ho entenc perfectament perque viu en una regió bilingüe, ací es parla espanyol i valencià. Varis idiomes llatins els entenc relativament be per mig de la llectura, pero oralment solament en alguns casos, per eixemple: l'italià puc entendre-lo en gran part quan l'escolte, pero no sé interpretar-lo quan lligc, mentres que el portugués em costa d'escoltar, pero hi han moltes paraules molt paregudes a l'espanyol i també puc llegir-lo sense problemes
L'accent català que hi ha pel nort i en la regió oriental de parla catalana òbviament no tinc problemes per a entendre llegint, pero hi ha paraules i frases que em costen prou d'entendre per l'accent, que considere que és molt més senzill en la meua regió. De francés puc llegir un poquet perque també hi han paraules que són similars a les del vocabulari valencià.
Yo diria que el portugués és l'idioma més fàcil d'entendre per mig de llectura per a mi, mentres que l'italià és el més difícil, pero per comprensió oral el francés el considere com el més difícil, i l'italià el més fàcil
Esquecícheste do galego :(
Ahora que los del norte no nos entienden, vamos a planear la masacre, hermanos latinos
Català aquí, basicament és occità (francès antic) que va evolucionar dins d'Espanya
Gramàticament s'assembla molt al francès, i parlat s'assembla al Italià. Tot això és obviament ignorant que ja s'assembla a tots els idiomes romànics
Yo hablo francés e italiano porque es muy fácil aprender una lengua Romance si vives en otro país del sur
El único que no comprendo, sobre todo al oral, es el rumano pero creo que es por la escritura
La única palabra que no entiendo del todo es "vicinanza", creo que puede ser "vecindad" (neighborship), es así?
Y sí, el italiano y portugués escritos son muy parecidos al español, es divertido ver como 80% de las palabras vienen de la misma palabra original del latín pero han evolucionado diferentemente
Gloria al imperio Romano, (entendí bastante: 95%)
Es impresionante como puedo entender prácticamente todo aún no habiendo estudiado italiano en mi vida, y como a los italianos os pasa igual
Puedo hablar catalán, pero el catalán se parece más al francés. Es curioso como el español y el italiano se parecen tanto, y a su vez el francés se parece menos aún siendo un país que está en medio de ambos
Quizás tenga que ver el carácter histórico como por ejemplo que España e Italia en según qué territorios formaban parte de una misma corona durante bastantes siglos
Perdoa, pero non queremos bárbaros xermánicos neste noso impe- quero dicir post
El rumano es el más difícil de entender para mí, entiendo un 30%, es muy diferente del español, probablemente porque vuestro país está separado y aislado de los otros paises de habla latina, mientras los demás han estado en contacto
(Romanian is the hardest to understand for me, I understand maybe a 30%, it's very diferent from Spanish, probably because your country is separated and isolated from the other latin countries while the other languages have been in contact)
A mi el francés me parece muy críptico, ¡y eso que lo estudié en el instituto
Aún así, como son mensajes cortos, con un poco de esfuerzo yo creo que también se entiende
Sería interesante ver a alguien escribiendo en esas lenguas
Sobre el portugués es curioso que siendo yo de España me parezca más fácil de entender el portugués de Brasil que el portugués de Portugal
Tienes razón, la comprensión oral es mucho más difícil
Tal vez debiéramos fundar /r/LatinEuropa y comunicarnos de esta forma, así ¡tal vez mejoraríamos nuestra comprensión de los otros idiomas de la familia
I was just waiting for this
Tibi gratias ago
Si jo parlant català i espanyol ja tinc avantatge respecte a colcu que només parla una llengua, tu amb 3 llengües i mitja ja ho tens pràcticament fet xD
É iso sardo
Si veo que más o menos somos parte de la misma familia, que vienen del latino de los romanos
Catalán: Si veig que més o manco som part de la mateixa familia, que ve del llatí dels romans
Pero la parte entre paréntesis no la entiendo 100%
Yo no creo que una persona francesa/española/italiana va a poder entender mi lengua
(I don't think a french/spanish/italian person can understand my language)
Home, el cas del galleg i el català és diferent, però no és tan habitual que un italià o un francès estudii castellà (tampoc es no n'hi hagui cap, però jo diria que el 98% d'italians no parlen espanyol)
Entiendo todo menos "beaucoup".
Con el francés es curioso, una frase la entiendo 100% pero la siguiente no entiendo nada xD
" Je ne pensais pas que j’en comprendrais autant
Mais ça demande de la concentration, surtout les premières phrases " 100% understandable, I know every single word, the only little doubt is "surtout" but I think it means "sobre todo" = "specially""
C’est incroyable, avec un peu de travail on pourraient tous " don't understand a single word of those, only c'est = it is, travail = work
peu = foot
Definitivamente el rumano es la lengua romance más difícil
Como dices supongo que la influencia de las lenguas eslavas y turcas ha afectado mucho
También los italianos, franceses y españoles hemos tenido mucho contacto, mucho comercio y, en cambio, los rumanos estabáis más aislados
Pero aún así entiendo 70% de lo que dices :)
Esperanto has multiple words from latin languages, this interests me, if you can understand
I think that Esperanto is very easy to understand
(I cannot guess what ankau means) motivates me to learn other languages
Esperanto is only (hobia = hobby
) language
(And the last sentence is hard to understand) It's a created language that has a lot in common with the culture
If you know English+1 romance language you can try to guess the meaning of everything but it's definetively easier for me to understand Italian or Portuguese, even French than Esperanto
I'd say Esperanto is as hard to understand as Romanian, and this is if you speak English, for someone who doesn't speak English it'd be harder than Romanian
They're called romance languages but yeah, the name comes from Roma so I guess you're half right
It's sad that I studied German for 2 years in high school and I could only understand 3 words out of 4 (I didn't know what Bahnof was), while I'm able to understand 90% of italian which I've never studied
That's what pissed off kids say when they aren't invited to the cool kids' party
¡Parece un dialecto oscuro del francés!
Sí, bueno, en su caso una variante del catalán que se habla en Baleares si no me equivoco, verdad u/paniniconqueso ?
I could understand that but I don't know if that's thanks to the English knowledge or because I have an A2 certificate in Dutch
I think knowing how to read it helps a lot as that way it seems much more similar to English
Guillerme o Conquistador, heroe olvidado da latinidade
Un oscuro dialecto del francés
Significa:
Ich   verstehe   nur   banhoff
Yo    entiendo   solo  estación
Es un dicho alemán que significa “estoy confundido”.. el equivalente de “me suena a chino”
No he comprendido casi nada
No lo sé exactamente, si están escritos las dos variantes son fáciles, pero en cuanto al lenguage hablado del portugués de Brasil entiendo 80-90% y del portugués de Portugal 50%.
Creo que entiendo mejor italiano hablado que portugués de Portugal hablado
Nunca he creado una, pero creo que simplemente tienes que acceder a una que esté libre y desde ahí se puede registrar
Well maybe it ha something to do with the fact that our ancestors spoke the same language 1500 years ago :)
Ah si, teño lido sobre el
Anglonormando creo que se chama
Lol, that's a funny expression xD
Qui si parlano le lingue romane
Il inglese e il tedeco sono prohibiti
Em pensava xerraves un altre idioma quan he començat a llegir jaja
Exacte
És la destrossa de la llengua normanda que van fer aquests bàrbars saxons quan le Guillem va anar a educar-los
Not sure if this is the case elsewhere but in Spain the guests are expected to give money to the married couple as a gift, this called “el cubierto
” Depending on who you invite you can end up making a tidy profit from having a wedding
> Also, at every wedding I've been to people danced the conga line
Can't explain why, but that also happens here
In many weddings, after the main dishes and before the dessert, the female friends of the bride take the groom to the bathroom steal his shorts cutting them in pieces
The male friends of the groom do the same with the garter of the bride (the groom is the one to steal it getting under her skirt)
The pieces of both clothes are sold to the guests, putting the money inside an empty bottle
The profits go to the married couple
It might be dirty in the case of the groom shorts, but I think currently they get new shorts for this thing to happen
It does seem a little bit crass, I admit
But it’s very common just to give money at a lot of occasions, like communions, godparents give money to their godchildren at certain feast holidays, etc
I can count on one hand the number of times I received a gift I actually liked, so I’m fine with the money haha
Interesting, no it does not mean envelope but rather cutlery/place setting, basically meaning you are paying for your meal
However the two probably share an etymology because cubierto more technically means “covered,” like an envelope covers :)
The old imperial flag, the Cross of Burgundy
I think it's more beautiful than the rojigualda, but sadly, today that flag is used by far-right movements and is the emblem of the Carlists
For Spain i saw one which was red white yellow in horizontal lines like Hungary, fucking lives it thougth i think it was meant for a united Iberia
I'd swap the bottom red with purple
I like purple
Back to the [Republican flag] The purple band is obviously different but notice also that the royal crown is replaced by a mural crown
The band ratio also changes from 1:2:1 to 1:1:1, but I actually prefer the 1:2:1 ratio as it's more unique
So my ideal flag would be something like [this] but horizontal (best picture I could find with 1:2:1 ratio)
I would only leave the colours so its like this  but the red is 2/3 and the yellow 1/3, simetric and simple
The old one, the one that caused terror in all Europe when we were the baddies
Maybe with purple instead of red to appease the (second) republicans
Add two legs
Or go all-in and add 5 and become a spider
One of my favorite flags for these reasons
Even the proportions
I feel like that would be too similar to the black and grey crosses on nazi tanks and such
Your flag is beautiful and perfect the way it is
It's also called the Cross of burgundy, one of the territories of our empire, not the Cross of Spain
So it doesn't really represent our current nation, or at least not originally
I mean, if you reunified, you probably have to end up changing the constitution anyway
Why isnt that a thing
Yet
I don't think it's common to charge a fixed rent but at least help to pay the bills and food
If you're living at your parent's and working (which is very common) and you don't collaborate it's because you're either spoiled or ungrateful
Depends on context
It's not normal while they have to study and find their forst work
Then maybe you have to help with the house costs, bit not a fixed ammount
As others said, it's very uncommon in Spain
Both because family culture and because with our job market that would be pointless, since taking away any amount from your children will only make them stay longer, not being able to afford moving out
It is common for older generations to own one or several housing units as opposed to renting, which is done by said young people that don't have the financial security to buy, so if your parents own the place (no or very little mortgage left) why charge when they can help you moving out
Of course if the family is humble or struggling you give everything to keep afloat, or if you're not studying and deciding to work it's normal to collaborate, but as long as you're studying and in need of support it would be both frowned upon and impracticable
I think that's the norm in the majority of Europe
Well, in Spain we had [Copito de Nieve]  it was an albino gorilla who was pretty loved
Sadly, it passed away on 2003
My granny has one of those *galos*, so typical haha
That we have a lisp
In most areas of Spain we pronounce the z and c (if it's in front of e/i) like a th sound and the s like a proper s. I think a small area lisps most of the time, but all of Spanish Speaking America do an almost s sound with z/c, and even the South of Spain
Edit: i don't know other ways to describe Spanish, maybe a boring version of Italian
I've been told Castilian Spanish sounds like Greek, and I have to agree
i'm sorry but these really make sense, Dutch is so guttural
It also depends on who speaks it, I know a Dutch person who doesn't sound guttural when speaking it, and i've heard some Dutch songs that sounded pleasant to listen to
(BTW i'm not saying Dutch sounds horrible or anything, i don't know how to say it doesn't sound really strong)
Makes sense
Finnish pronunciation is not too hard as a Spaniard, and Japanese doesn't sound too weird either
Basque sounds like Spanish
Since when
Edit: As you guys have pointed out the problem is that as a native speaker I can tell the difference, but to non native they sound practically identical
Is it because that's just how Basque works or because of the influence of the Spanish language over the years
Especially since standard Basque is artificial so it'd make sense that it lost some of its accent
If that's the case then it kind of sucks for Basque
But if that's how it's always sounded then good
I still don't understand the lisp thing
English use words like Thanks, Think, etc
and nobody say they have a lisp
"Wow, you Spanish guys speak SO fast" is the most common description I get from foreigners
Admittedly the lisp thing drives me crazy
A lisp is a speech impediment, the z sound is just a goddamn sound, like any other sounds like n, b or t! Especially when it comes from an English speaker
It's like, dude, you have it in your own language, wtf
As of how it sounds, I've been told we sound basically like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yeah here in the canaries we pronounce our z as an s aswell with one notable exception (that I know of atleast) being Zara (the clothes/ home decor store that everyone's mums adore) and the same goes for the c which to be honest I had no idea was pronounced differently
It's like they have a metrome when speaking . I like it
You guys are scary
Is szrzcz a word in Polish
I thought consonant-only words weren't a thing in Polish
Phonology is very similar
5 same vowels and very similar consonants
Basque from Guizpuzkoa doesn't as it has lots of "sh" sounds (x = sh, tx = tsh), but Basque from Bizkaia has pretty much the same sounds as Spanish (x = s, tx = ts)
I think that's because spanish words roll off the tongue really easily
No vowels last longer than others, unless the speaker wants to give an effect to what they're saying
Consonant agrupations like -mbr- or -rm- don't take long to pronounce, and words connect with each other really fluently
And in case a word is complicated or doesn't fit THAT well in the sentence phonetically, most people will just not pronounce it correctly and still be understood
I've noticed that in english there are really weird consonant agrupations like "tasks" or "lists" that really slow down the speech, as you have to say "sks" (which i struggle with) and then separate it from the next word a bit
There are also words like "bee", "long" or "keep", that take longer to pronounce because it's a long vowel
I don't think we have those in spanish, english is interesting for these things
Any Spaniard would say Italian is a sexier version of Spanish
Lol, that's how we see Italian, a sexier version of Spanish :)
I guess it's always the other way around, for us Italian is sexier
If you watch national TV, most people speak with the "standard accent", from the Madrid-Castilla area
I didn't know how Canarians spoke until I watched a video, i somehow imagined you spoke like we do
It is funny how Latin Americans think ceceo is common in Spain when it is used only in some parts of Andalusia
Despite the coughing Dutch is a nice language (i hope i'm not the only one who thinks this)
What is common in some parts of Andalucia is "ceceo". In the rest of Spain there is a difference between, for instance,  "caso" \[kaso\] and "cazo" \[*kaθo*\], but in parts of Seville or Huelva they would pronounce both \[*kaθo*\]
For some reason, there seems to be a certain stigma to "ceceo" in these regions, so it's apparently disappearing from the Andalusian accent
A lisp is a speech impediment (called "Sigmatismo" in Spanish)
Pronunciation of c/z in Spain is not a lisp, it is the correct pronunciation of the phoneme in our dialect
The same that when you say Thanks you are using the correct pronunciation for your phoneme in English
Both languages use different letters for the same sound, Spanish c/z and English use th
But that is spelling, the sound is the same
So, no, there are not 40 million  Spaniards with a speech impediment
I agree
We can say a full-length sentence in one single (long) blow, by connecting one word with another (in poetry, that's called 'sinalefa'), and I think that makes for a beautiful flow
Yeah standard accent I can understand perfectly fine it's only  other minority accents that I struggle with but that's mainly because A: my parents are British so I mainly watch English TV and B: you generally don't meet many tourists from Catalunia in the Canaries
I think maybe in Mexico they would use the ceceo for people who use the zeta sound, because they don't use the sound, when in reality for us ceceo is using the zeta sound for everything
I legit thought you was insulting me lol
Oh wow that's really interesting
I guess the different sounds sexier haha, I remember during my teens many times me and my friends pretended to be Italian to boost our chances in parties or clubs
Thank you Italy for the contributions that your countrymen have done to Spanish culture and science
[Juanelo Turriano] and [Alejandro Malaspina] are the first that came to mind, but there are many others
I’d like to thank Germany for A4 paper
Best paper size ever
And France for modern law coding and government structures set up during the 29th century after we modeled our democracy
Also Germany for its constitution, model to the Spanish one
Denmark for Legos and industrial design
The UK for music and the Monthy Python
Italy for these small house appliances they produce like Vaporetta
Poland for the books by Alexandra Mizielinska and Daniel Mizielinski that my baby read every day
Thanks Sweden and UK for your music
Thanks Switzerland for your privacy laws
Thanks Germany for your top tier industry
Thanks France and Italy for being nice role models for Spain
Thanks Portugal for being there with us even in the toughest of times
Thanks to all those in Europe that think we have more in common than not and make an effort to keep us united
Germans, good tourists (I'm from Mallorca, they take the island every summer) and not as cold as the stereotypes say
Can't thank Italy enough for the Roman empire and the Renaissance
Oh and the food too
The great Spanish general Ambrosio Spínola was actually Italian
Say thanks for A4
You are the fucking man
Thank you
Nobody thanked us and you touch my heart
I thank you, Bulgaria, because one of my best friends and probably the person that most makes m**e** laugh is from Sofia
You are right, I was mainly focusing on science and culture, but military leaders like Spinola, Farnesio or Andrea Doria were very important for Spain
Our former King was actually born in Rome
Biggest fish market in Europe is in Madrid
Omg green wine and vinho pressão. YUM
Boooffffff, sardines and green wine, erotic fantasy to me
My flat has a door that locks automatically so the minute it's closed, no one can open from outside
I was once sitting in my living room, in an apartment where the door led to the street (in the US), and luckily it was locked because I saw the knob being moved, someone trying to get in
I shudder to think what would have happened
Another time I lived in a high rise where you needed a key to come in ( in the UAE) and i would not lock the doors during the day at first
I was in my room and heard my  cat growl like a dog and I walked out and saw that someone had opened and closed my front door (I had something hanging from the knob that was moving
So I walked to the door to lock it at the same time they started to open it again
Since then I've never left a door unlocked
I live alone and I do it just so I don't forget to get the keys
I always lock the door and leave the keys in the lock, so I have to unlock the door before going out, minimizing the chances of forgetting the keys
I always do, I've never had any problem or robbery but I have a little daughter that knows how to open doors so it's better to lock it
As a general rule, all front doors are locked from the outside and can only be opened from the inside, locked with the key or not
Personally I lock the door with the key at night or when there is no one in the flat, bcs it's very easy to bypass the automatic lock if someone really wants to enter the house (a friend of mine left his keys inside his flat and we managed to get in using the library card because the lock was very basic)
Whenever I have had to move flat I have always appreciated if the door had an armoured lock or a vertical lock in addition to the horizontal one
Why so much paranoia
Because in Spain, especially in seaside areas in summer, there was a time when it was common for burglars to mark the frames of doors that were easy to open and then break in and steal
I can't even imagine if doors didn't have automatic locks
For people worried about what happens if you forget your keys and how annoying it's that ppl can't visit you without having to knock on the door: it's a cultural issue
You don't forget your keys any more than you forget your mobile phone or wallet, and it's something you do "from birth", something we have internalised
If someone visits you, it's normal for them to tell you first, so getting up to open the door is no bother at all
What would be really annoying is if they showed up in my living room while I'm in my underwear and drooling on the sofa
Bless all the locking doors
And those of you who are thinking about how uncomfortable it's to go out in the garden and so on, we're the second country in the EU with the highest % of people living in flats, many of us have only seen a real garden on TV
That sounds terrifying
Yon meid jis güei tu e tavern zru de dark forest, onli tu faind aut dat ji forgot de moni
In Spanish, it would be _”Yon meid jis güei tu a tavern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat ji forgot de moni”_
Spanish has not enough vowels and also the "J" in John cannot be represented
But it'd be something like this:
Jon meid jis uei tu a tavern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind out tat je forgot de moni
"John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money".
On Spanish:
Yon meyd jis wey chu a chavern zru de dark forest, onli chu faind aut that ji forgot de moni
Llon meid jis güey tu a tavern zru de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat ji forgot jis many
Spanish
Z sound is like th in Spain
They don’t have that sound in Latin America
The th in the is not present at the beginning of the word in Spanish and they would make a d sound
Many vowel sounds don’t exist and they are approximations to the Spanish five vowels
Something like this:
"Jon meid his uey tu a tavern zru de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat hi forgot de many"
Edit: It's curious how similar is to the polish one
Yon meid jis güey tu a tabern zru de darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat je forgot de moni
Creo que lo hubiese escrito igual y me la juego a que la inmensa mayoria de españoles también. Parece que somos la única banderita que pondríamos "moni" en vez de "mani". Lo mismo con "onli" en vez de "ounli". No sé si nos lo han enseñado así a todos o es que nos aferramos a nuestras vocales como percebes
¿Voy a tener que borrar el comentario porque una panda de pedantes sentados enfrente de una pantalla no podéis entender que es igual de incorrecto transcribir 'money' como 'moni' o 'mani'?
Las vocales en inglés son demasiado difíciles de transcribir al español, no es ni 'onli' ni 'ounly'; ni 'mani' ni 'moni', por eso lo he representado de la primera manera, ya que creo que se acerca algo más
It's just these sounds are difficult to represent with Spanish phonetics
I could've chosen 'mani' instead of 'moni' and it would be just as inaccurate
I do too
However I think it's not 'moni' or 'mani', it's an intermediate sound which I can't represent with Spanish phonetics
So basically there isnt a single good new as a popular subject in Europe at the moment
Is it just me or the world is a big shit these times
You know I never understood that saying
By definition an exception does not confirm something but negates it
In Spain we have 17 regions, which are further subdivided into a total of 50 smaller partitions (usually called provinces)
and we have 50 public universities
Therefore not much importance is given to which is the best, most students simply go to their nearest university or to the one they consider best for their field within their region
For example, I'm Andalusian and I studied at the University of Granada, which has a regional reputation in law and, above all, in medicine (the average mark required to enter medicine in Granada is usually very very high)
There re many students from all over the region and also many Erasmus students (because its WITHOUT DUBT the best university city to party)
Nowadays a university is pointed out as good if it gets you a job when you finish your studies, so the most prestigious universities are private universities in Madrid or Barcelona, with strong relationships with private companies
For Law in Spain, the best seems to be "Universidad Carlos III". It is a pretty new public university in the outskirts of Madrid
It has the reputation to be really progressive and with a vibrant student body
All true but usually the best scored Universities internationally are Pompeu Fabra, UPC, UAB and UB (from Catalonia) and Complutense, UPM and UAM (from Madrid)
Not in that order though
I would go with: Andorra and liechtenstein
I've been to Andorra, and it's a meh
The city is plain and the ski resorts expensive
Liechtenstein just feels uninteresting
I know some bits of their history and they were interesting but there's nothing that calls me
Of the big ones Germany has nothing (that I know) really that makes me say ‘oh id like to see that
Also the nordic countries look pretty dull to me, like the have a super good quality of life apparently but ... I don’t know, they look boring to death
If you've never been to the Pyrinees it may be cool to visit like 1 day
and that's it hahaha It's only cool if you want to skii
Yeah, I grew up visiting it every year (I, too, live very close) and we spent half the time buying liquor or cigarettes but I don't smoke and the price isn't that good anymore
You can go skiing but I have other places nearby too
You have Kofola
That alone makes you one of the best countries in the world
Sincerely everything you consider a given
Great expanses of pine forests, lakes and swamps
Coming from spain lakes and swamps aren't actually our strong point
neither are great expanses of flat forest
It's just a nice change of enviroment
I have to give a shout out for belgium
It's a nice country, often overlooked because of its neighbours
However, many things we think of as dutch or french actually come from belgium
Think renaissance cities and french fries with mussles
Good food, good beer, really nice cities and an interesting culture, and if you're bored you can always try to figure out their government and win a millions dollars by actually doing It
or die trying
Try chocolate
And actually a lot of things people think are French but ar Belgian
I dont know why I defend them when they hate us but
Well hate wasnt what the op was asking for lol
The music
Lol only for The Cranberries they’re adorable
Yes you also can, but Andorra has a really good connection with Barcelona, it's only 2:30h, other good skii places in Catalonia are 2h minimum, so it's not really a problem to do 30min more to reach Andorra
Bah
Slovakia is way comfier as a whole, so Czechs got 1 point and you Slovaks got 2 points :D
Well,you underestimate finland
You have more than 180
000 lakes and a great reputation across Europe
Even if Russia has the same Laky, swampy, foresty territory they haven't showed It to the world
I think theirs IS also more dispersed and worse connected
No worries I was kidding
I always name the 3 together because I used to point their positions wrongly in a map all the time (and their capitals too)
Now I don't mix them, but sadly I still don't know many things about those 3 countries…
It's funny because in Spanish Latvia is called "Letonia" so saying the three names is like a pun with rhyme: Estonia, Letonia y Lituania
"Good for you" also translates quite rudely to Spanish, as in "yeah, whatever, good for you". I've never heard it with a non-sarcastic undertone and was really confused to hear it in English being used unironically
Also the way brits say "lovely" comes off as super snobby and kinda wierd
Usually compliments can be perceived as rude, such as "Mira, guapa" (Look, beautiful), it is usually preceded to a row or scolding
Depends on what you compare it to
By world standards, we're not corrupt
Many countries in South America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe are FAR worse
But by Western European standards we're above average (more corruption than the average, I mean)
In general there is a lot of drive to fight corruption, it is investigated and corruption cases are constantly being discovered, which is a bad thing because it means they exist, but also a good thing because it means it's being fought
One of the most corrupt of Western Europe alongside Italy, but less corrupt than the East
Spain: hold my beer
Our previous president (Rajoy) had to leave due to a "moción de censura" (vote of no confidence) because his party huge amount of corruption scandals
The most corrupt country in West Europe
I think it's because there are a lot of old people, and they keep voting for the two old political parties, and those are the most corrupt ones
I said that because I remember one time my History teacher, who is always making fun of everything, wanted to show us how corrupt our government was, and he showed us a list of the most corrupt countrys
In fact, I don't know the year that list was based on or if it was a reliable source
Well, it's supernice to write here, one of the subs i enjoy the most, so no wonder :D
You think that if we get that many we can finally invade it
must be because all the  pączki  foodporn they're posting today :D
[El Concierto de Aranjuez, de Joaquín Rodrigo] If Spain was music, I'm sure it would sound like this
For Spain I'd definitely say [Entre dos aguas ] by Paco de Lucía
In catalan I would say it's "el cant dels ocells". Everytime I listen to it I get goosebumps
[el cant dels ocells ]
For me, is definitely this one, [El Gato Montés]
Hear it, it's beautiful
EDIT: These types of songs or "pasadobles", as are known in spanish, are played before or after a bullfight
I don't like bullfighting, but I love this kind of songs
[An example of this song playing before a bullfight ]
Boig per tu - Sau
(it's in catalan, not spanish, but it's beautiful)
I also love Debussy’s Arabesque No
1 and Prelude (I) from Suite Bergamasque (the suite in which Clair de lune is the third piece/movement)
Non-piano wise I think the most beautiful piece could easily be Ravel’s String quartet in F Major
Gorgeous
Shut up British citizen, don't flex to the rest of us
The same around here
Olive this
Some people here already suggested an EU-wide high speed rail network, but I'd suggest enlarging Airbus to ESA levels of European implication and developing the first commercial "ecological" planes (hydrogen, electricity
As the first models would be for domestic flights, we'd eventually replace the kerosene planes
I know it's toward outside the EU, but I think it would be great (and not so difficult) to make a runner connecting Spain with Morocco (read Ceuta/Melilla)
It's much shorter than Helsinki-Tallinn and having a corridor to our neighbouring continent has so much potential
Easing travel and commerce, increasing the influence of our consolidated democracies to help other countries develop, etc
Edit: of course I misspelt the most important word of the comment
*tunnel, I meant tunnel
I know it's toward outside the EU, but I think it would be great (and not so difficult) to make a runner connecting Spain with Morocco (read Ceuta/Melilla)

[Open-source computing hardware] (Semiconductor factories are pretty large)
Since they all use standard gauge rails I think we should keep the trains each country uses
Stations would look like airports where you see planes from all over
Plus I just want to see a Talgo 350 in, like, Austria so I can point and be like "my boi".
It sounds great, but except for the environment part I don´t see why people would use trains instead of a plane for a distance over 500km or so
Like no one would take a train from Madrid to Paris that may take over 7-8 hours when the plane does it in 2 and has no stops in the middle
I can see such a network working around central Europe, but for the North and South it doesn´t would be as effective and probably not really used
And it would be crazy expensive for the user, in Japan the Shinkansen is normally two times (or even 3/4) more expensive than the plane, because of how costly it is to mantain on such distances
Good luck with that
My country doesn't even have standardized secondary education on its own territory, each region creates their own rules
It's not
For those of us living in mountainous areas, the train networks are still very bad
I hate flying and adore trains and wish we could take a train quickly anywhere, but I feel making fuel-efficient airplanes is a more likely and immediate goal that will serve the most people
I don't think that would be a smart move
That´s true for a certain distance, but it´s definitely not the case for long distances
For example, I don´t think people would take a train Madrid-Amsterdam, even if high speed, because it would be probably 6-8 hours longer, and also more expensive than a plane
Planes are horrible for the environment, but for a distance longer than 600/800km they´re still the most effective, comfortable and cheapest way of transport
If there´s something that has made people travelling across Europe so much, it´s plane tickets, specially for the non-central parts of Europe
A train from Belgium to Germany sounds all nice, but one from Spain to Italy and you see it makes 0 sense at all
>What China has been doing over the last 10 years with expanding their 350 km/h high speed rail network is definitely something Europe should take after
We already connected Madrid and Barcelona with the French border with a HSL designed for 350Km/h (trains currently running in the line capped at 320Km/h though), but at the French side of the border there's a conventional rail line so no high speed connection at all :(
If France doesn't connect us, we cannot connect to the rest of Europe, given that Portugal isn't very interested in a HS link either
Nah, Portugal is our favourite rectangle
I agree, there needs to be a change for the environment, planes pollute way too much and for short distances they should be used as less as possible, but we cant lie saying trains are more comfortable for long distances, when they just are not
Planes, if we like it or not, are a vital part of globalization and the modern world, we can´t just pretend we use trains from now on for everything
Would love that if it were possible
We could build a station in each Balearic Island
I agree with the climate part, but I think people don´t realize how crazy expensive high speed trains are
You compared the case of Japan
I live in here, and for a longer distance, the train ticket (shinkansen) is usually 2 or 3 times more expensive than the plane ticket
A lot of taxes would need to go into it for the price being so low that people actually use it in Europe, specially with the different economic power people have
Someone in the Netherlands my be able to afford it, but someone in Spain or Croatia not, and then the whole system makes no sense
Teruel, The region even created a political party [Teruel existe] (Teruel exists)
Also Murcia
To be fair, the political party was created to raise awareness of the "España vacía" Or empty Spain, which refers to how places like herself and rural areas in general almost don't have population, there are even empty towns being sold
Also Cuenca
The joke isn't about its existence, is about how far it's and not knowing where it is exactly
But the case of Teruel is because they feel abandonated by the government, not by the people (as in the case of Murcia)
Bonus points for the opposite
We invented the place of "Babia" and we use "You are on Babia" when someone is daydreaming
There is no such place as Babia
The yanks dropped two nukes there by accident and we couldn't even be bothered to clean them up, because it wasn't worth it at all
Babia existe
>Durante la Edad Media la realeza y las clases más altas acudían a pasar sus periodos vacacionales y disfrutar de una buena cacería, debido a la abundancia de presas que por allí habitaban
>Era un sitio idóneo como lugar de reposo, donde refugiarse y distraerse de los farragosos problemas en la Corte de León, por aquel entonces reino
>Muchas fueron las ocasiones en las que los cortesanos necesitaban consultar al monarca algún asunto de vital importancia pero no podían ser recibidos por éste debido a que se encontraba ausente de palacio pues estaba en Babia
It's actually a super nice place
Ive went there with my family ages ago
The mythos probably comes when the Vulcano in Santorini exploded and whole islands with different civilizations dissapeard
So the "original" legend comes from Greece´s sea
After that many other legends have emerged, including the legend of it being in the middle between Europe and America, on the Gibraltar street, etc
Yo tampoco
Simplemente lo he aceptado como una realidad
Take your propaganda out of here
If we count only Monarchs of Unified Spain since early 16th century, we have:
**Males**: Felipe, Carlos, Fernando, Luis, Amadeo, Alfonso and Juan Carlos

If we also include Regents then we can add Baldomero (my favourite) and María Cristina
If we include Kings of Castille, Leon, Asturias, Navarra, Aragon and the Moorish Caliphs and Emirs, we have a plenty

Well, that was fun
Edit: How could I forget Amadeo
Our best monarch no doubt, abdicated the crown because there was no hope in ruling this country
If I have male twins I'll call them Ramon Berenguer and Berenguer Ramon
Or perhaps rather not
Carlos, Felipe, Fernando and Alfonso are the most popular names in our royal family
Isabel and María + whatever for girls
But Visigoth kings are top tier
[Wamba] lol
Hoooo boy, im gonna go with the Visigoths
Ataúlfo, Sigerico, Walia, Teodorico I, Turismundo, Teodorico II, Eurico, Alarico II, Gesaleico, Teodorico III, Amalarico, Teudis, Teudiselo, Ágila, Atanagildo, Liuva I, Leovigildo, Recaredo, Liuva II, Witerico, Gundermaro, Sisebuto, Recaredo II, Suintila, Sisenando, Khintila, Tulga, Chindasvinto, Recesvinto, Wamba, Ervigio, Égica, Witiza, Ágila II and Rodrigo
Those are the 35 visigoth monarchs, from 395-711 BC, these fuckers died quickly
NO FERDINAND, FOR THE LAST TIME, YOU CANNOT CALL THE KID ADOLF (soz I had to do the joke)
That does not expand the list a whole lot: Carlos, Felipe, Fernando, Luis
How would you pronounce Fajsz
In Modern Family when Gloria teachs Spanish she teachs Italian in the Spanish version (it's ridiculous because we know in Colombia they speak Spanish)
&#x200B;
In Daredevil the Spanish speakers are turned portuguese speakers
&#x200B;
Sometimes the Spanish is left, so someone speak spanish and the listener doesn't understand until other person "translates" spanish to spanish
&#x200B;
Those are usually the changes made (Spanish to Italian, Spanish to Portuguese or Spanish with no changes)
[There's a Spanish youtuber who made videos about how they managed to translate parts in Spanish in series and movies, if you speak Spanish, you should give it a try]
Is Spain dubbing, when someone wants to refer to a family in Mexico, here they change to italian so it's reallu foreign but still some people can translate
Also, let's just no get started with the Sabrina's live action series in Spain
But I guess it is as ridiculous as the Spanish dub (Paolo is Italian, but any Spaniard could understand everything he said, so the dub sounds totally unbelievable )
Here Dora la Exploradora (it rhythms) teach English too, but it's dubbed to make her speak European Spanish
It teaches English in Spain too, obviously
Serbians are in love of Spanish-speaking culture because of telenovelas and Spanish soap operas being really popular there
It's that the Latino dubbing or the Spain one
Have you seen Extremadura's? It's similar but with a black stripe
Maybe you like it
The old one
> She does have a stereotypical mediterranean name
TIL
Spent some time in Belgrade and it is an incredibly vibrant city
Really cheap too, although not very pretty
I think in the version from Spain it works better because they just play a Colombian accent on her while the rest speak with an accent from Spain
It is also pretty common in Spain for rich old guys to marry young girls from Dominican Republic or Colombia as well
They don't make Gloria look dumb
Every Spaniard is going to say the Spanish omelette fight so I'm gonna say an underrated division in our country:
Nesquik or Colacao
Spanish omelette with or without onion
But there is only one right answer: onions make it better
With onion or without onion, in Spain there are traditional dish Tortilla de Patatas (omelette of potatoes
) And it can be done with or without onion, but if you like one of these, then you hate the other option
(Well, is an exaggeration, we don't hate, we are civilized people, and anyways it doesn't matter because all who like tortilla without onion are wrong, and they must to be exiliated, so)
Apart from the famous tortilla one, there's a division in how we say olive: 'Oliva' or 'Aceituna'.
I would say if you put onion or not in a tortilla with potato
Tortilla: cement or raw on the inside
Tortilla: onion or not
Paella: green beans or not
Paella: mixed
(No)
At least we can all unite in the fact that all divisions are either due to food or language
In Spain is made with mayonnaise (we call them "Russian salad")
It usually has boiled potato, boiled egg, tuna (and some optional extras)
Colacao Turbo or Nesquik
Always hated the "grumitos"
&#x200B;
Also, after being eating Nocilla all my life once I tasted Nutella, the Nocilla tastes like vomit, I guess Nocilla has butyric acid, like [american chocolate]
When I lived in the Philippines, I loved Milo
But here in Spain, I’m 100% team ColaCao
Yes
Nesquik was so much better (haven't had one in ages
Also, nocilla is better, but nutella is really good too
Colacao
It just tastes more to chocolate
Ahhh these words bring flashbacks of my lovely time in Crete
Same thing happened in Spain, started off as "el covid" after "el virus del covid" i guess
But at some point last year the media started using "la covid" after "la enfermedad covid". I still say "el covid", and oddly enough most people went back to calling it "el covid" as far as I can tell
Is a cake in the biscuit/cookie format: the better of the three worlds
And what was the result
Times like this I hate how quickly the pronunciation of a word can radically change by adding a single letter
To me, scone rhymes with cone, but add a C, and sconce sounds like gone
Here we go again
With onion, definitely
If I wanted egg and potatoes, I would have a fried egg with fries, which is a much better use of these two ingredients
Onion makes the tortilla for me
Just because you *concebollistas* say it louder doesn't mean you are right
im sorry but  i have to  disagree sir
Onion makes it perfect
But there is only one right answer: onions make it better
100% agree and on another note: dry Vs moist
I've encountered a couple of people who liked concrete for dinner
happy cake day
(its allowed to say this here, i hadnt see anyone saying it with the exception of one in a chat so i dont know if this its allowed)
Here the only thing i had see its to put the milk after you had heated the water, honestly no idea why
Ok, hear me out
Aren't the two sides equal
You flip it and it's the other way around
Yeah, we are civilized about it but it's pretty obvious that people who prefer it without onion are sociopaths who just want to watch the world burn to ashes
We keep em as far away as possible
>all who like tortilla without onion are wrong, and they must to be exiliated
I mean, can you really be spanish if you don't like onion
This also applies to “g” at the end of words, and even if I learnt to pronounce it like “sh” in English, I must admit that it was cringy af for me to hear someone saying “Duisbursh” :/
Obviously horchata is very good and tasty :P
Huh, is that why when I bought Hershey’s Kisses for the office, it was universally rejected by everyone except the South Americans
3 and 4 are perfect
2 and 5 are acceptable
We're the Ciudadanos of omelettes this time lol
However caramelized onion is ambrosia of the Gods
I realised reading your comment that people does exactly this with the butter from Soria (mounted butter with sugar and a bit of flavor)
This butter is pure sin and when people tries it, usually can't take only one
The eastern coast (what once was the kingdom of Aragon) says oliva, and the rest of Spain says aceituna
And in the aceituna part, we also say 'olivo' to the tree
I guess it's related with the use of Catalan and Aragonese
Edit: I forgot to add that in Murcia they say oliva too
People who have cats are psychopaths
Noted
Idk how south americans make chocolate, but it may be the cause
Um what is 1
If you have to eat a tortilla with a spoon, is it even a tortilla
Gordon Ramsey’s “It’s fookin RAW” comes to mind ngl
I'm a bit more on the liquid side
3 is perfect, 2 and 4 good, 5 acceptable
If someone brings 6 or god forbid 1 or 7 or that concrete block they call "8" I'm chasing them with a hatchet
Sadly here in Andalusia you usually find 6-7 (maybe sometimes 5)
Runny tortillas in bars is one of the few things I miss from the time I lived in Madrid :P
That's funny, I wouldn't consider that a sandwich
Here we call them "tostas" or "tostadas". We only call it "Sandwich" when referring to a two loafed conception made with tin bread . If the bread is a baguette, we call it "bocadillo".
It was a Beamtin from Krefeld hahaha
But anyone else said it right
Same here and we are not small
No matter how hard I try but I'll always mix Belgrade and Sarajevo at first, and later think: ok, Belgrade -> Serbia and Sarajevo -> Bosnia
Do you mean massive slave trade
And why not slaves
Iberians did nothing wrong
The main genocide in America was the smallpox
That does not mean Spain didn't kill, slave and destroy, but it was never a genocide
Colonization of America was brutal, but it was not a planned genocide as some claim, and it was mainly driven by greed
Many events of excessive cruelty by spanish settlers were condenmed by the authorities
Colonial times were not a wonderful tale of diversity as other people say
I think our history (European in general, Iberian in particular) must be treated ruthlessly but with justice
I've seen far-right Spaniards portraying the Spanish Empire as a fairy tale
Btw, happy cake day
We gave up Cuba, Puerto Rico and Philippines in 1898, and Ecuatorial Guinea and Western Sahara in the 1970s, but these last two were not important
The war of 1898 against the USA is know as the 'disaster of the 98' and it is a very important moment in Spanish history
In Spanish snail is said caracol which (if written cara col) traslates to cabbage face
In spanish,slug translates to "babosa" wich means slimy
Perezoso (Sloth) = Lazy One
Armadillo = Little Armored One
Polla de Agua (Moorhen) = Water Cock
Chotacabras (Owlet-Nightjar) = Kidgoats
Puercoespín (Porcupine) = Spiny Hog
Mariquita (Ladybug) = Originally Little Mary, now Little Faggot
Pito Real (Green Woodpecker) = Royal Dick
Leopardo (Leopard) = Brown Lion
Conejillo de Indias (Guinea Pig) = Little Rabbit from the Indies
Pavo Real (Peacock) = Royal Turkey
We also have "washing bear" in Catalan (ós rentador)
> Gürteltier _(belt animal)_
Please tell me that they’re called like that because their skin looks beltlike, and not because of
I would add "Slug" which translates to "slimy" (babosa) and "Guinea pig" which translates to "little rabbit from the Indias" (conejillo de indias)
In catalan "turkey" is translated to "Indian rooster" (gall dindi) and "bat" translates to "winged rat" (ratpenat)
Isn't "ratpenat" Rat(a) penada
Penada vol dir amb ales, alada
Edir: bat had a huge variety of names in catalan, another one ver well-known is "ratapinyada" pinyada comes from Latin: with feathers and by extension winged too
True
I couldn't remember other curious names :-)
Same in Castilian, but the use of "Mariquita" for "Little Mary" has fallen in disuse and the word become something else
QED [
Gotta love them liberators
Macarena and Aserjé. I don't think I need to remind people about them, lol
Aserejé fucking slaps my dude
As a total outsider I would say even though it's an oldie 99 Luftballoons is definitely a match for Germany
My name's Diego, I feel uncomfortable when I listen to it
The theme of the song is that the guy named "Diego" they talk about is so wasted that when he goes to the club and asks the DJ for his favourite song, Rapper's Delight, he can only mumble the words
If you think about it this way, this was probably the first mumble rap in history, lol
Ah, what a great summer dancing to this song with offended mood
Burrito, gasolina, dale
Are you implying that masterpieces like Dragonstea din tei, Aserejé or Barbie Girl aren't good
Two words:
Santiago
Calatrava
Also some new Madrid's metro ampliations have been on renovation works more time than other lines that were 60-100 years old
Any
Well
this would be a loooong story but I can sum up with one highlight
They built an airport in Castellon and no plane has ever take off or landed there
That's the level
[Pajares high speed train tunnel] connecting Asturies with the Meseta (the plains)
[Tunnel still on construction after 15 years] with no end in sight
The construction was started without due diligence going through underground water deposits
After 15 years they haven't managed to stop the constant leakage of water into the tunnel
They also stopped for a while because money
Well the Sagrada Familia was supposed to have been finished in the 1880s
We have the Castellón airport, Who is practically unused, and the Nuevo Mestalla, which was supposed to be the new stadium for Valencia, but is under construction  since 2009
What about demolishing and starting again
Many of his works aren't practical (Zubizuri bridge in Bilbao, Ponte della Costituzione in Venice) or did cost way much more than expected (City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, the Mälmo skyscraper or the WTC subway hub in NYC)
Where I live it's all normal and I also haven't seen anything on this on the news
I've stocked just because my kitchen is chronically understocked
I use to have lunch at work and bring dinner with me when I get back home
so just in the probable case that I get sent to work at home I've bought enough to survive without my work canteen
I think I'm the exception, people is buying as usual
Nope
Except for hand sanitizer, you can't find that anywhere
Masks probably too
Not that I know
We're too lazy to make dramas out of a stupid virus
Not here (Southern Spain), everything was normal at the supermarket yesterday
All normal in bratislava
People here are "buying" masks and hand hygiene gels but not toilet paper I don't know what people is trying to achieve with that
Not so much toilet paper and stuff, but for sure alcohol, hand sanitizer, and masks
I believe it started in Hong Kong, some people started to believe that you could make masks with it and a group stole a bunch of toilet paper (like 300 packs or something crazy like that), plus some started buying it, others saw this and started buying like crazy not really knowing why but guided by panic I’d say: you are in a difficult and dangerous situation for some and suddenly see tons of people buying this like crazy right
You think it may help survival, at least unconsciously
This spread through Hong Kong and then other countries started copying it (Australia, Japan
) and here we are today
(FYI this is just my opinion from comments and posts I saw on Reddit, I don’t watch the mainstream media usually so idk if they’re enforcing this behavior or what)
I like it, almost everyone including workers are with the family on sundays and can go outside and chill
It is cool
Maybe it is because in Spain it always was that way and I'm accustomed
I see most people go for beautiful concepts, so I will propose one based mostly on sound and my personal connection with it:
Almazara - olive press, the machine to produce olive oil, incredibly numerous in my region
I find it such a beautiful word with an extremely pleasing pronunciation
That was the name of the old USSR space station
This seems to have a similar meaning to the Portuguese *saudade* listed above
I love this one
We have 2 types:
Badly written English name's (Izan, Brayan, Richar, Danyel, etc
Very old name's (Hermenegildo, Martirio, Concepción, Arsacio, etc
"Gorotz", literally means "crap" in basque
I can't understand why people would call their kids that way
Either bad adaptations from English like "yerson" or "brayan", or fucking old names like "Fructuoso", "Otilio" or "Gumersindo"
Real talk
You could say "Dolores", which mean "pains", but I actually like that name
There are so many random old people's names like "Sandalio"
I wonder if far in the future it will become more common again
It hasn't even been a full century since Hitler's death so I wouldn't expect it to be normal yet
Kiki means quick sex in spanish
Sandalio is my "favourite" old name
TIL this also happens all over Europe, lmao
In Spanish it would be:
Maycol
Brayan
Jessica/Jésica
And yeah those are like no no names
just doesn't sound right
They are English names but the adaptation to Spanish it's weird
the spelling and the sounds doesn't match at all
It sounds a lot like the word "chándal" in spanish, which means tracksuit/sweatsuit
Wouldn't recommend using it as a name in a Spanish-speaking country
Stop saying "from a Romance-speaking perspective" as if you were an authority on the matter, or as if you speak for every Romance-language speaker
Many of the names you mention seem fine, and under what "beauty standards" are you basing your choices
What are the beauty standards of Romance languages
Nothing it's wrong perse, but movies and books and memes had given certain connotation to them
For example, in Spanish "El Brayan" it's a way to refering a certain kind of person, like a thieve and robber
Of course this is in a funny way, so that's why I say it
I don't know if that happens in Italy too
I don't really know a lot of them but pretty sure we invented the chupa-chups, the cable car and the mop
The most used one has to be the disposable hypodermic needle, invented by Manuel Jalón.
Other notable inventions are the submarine (by Isaac Peral), and the auto-gyro a predecessor to the helicopter (by Juan de la Cierva)
The submarine, the cigar, the mop, the astronaut suit, disposable syringe, gyro (without it helicopters wouldn't be able to fly), high speed train and the laryngoscope
Most flavoured crisps are okay, but WHY would you invent onion and garlic flavoured ones
Only seen them there when I went to Dublin and I personally didn't like them at all and there were no non-flavoured ones haha
I always thought Him was invented in Switzerland because in Spanish it's called the same as Geneva, Ginebra
Disposable needles
Game changer in medicine
The guitar
Pretty important instrument, I would say the most important musical instrument together with the piano
Also proper blinds
I think we also invented the cable car (i think it's called that in english but idk lol but teleférico)
We invented the lollipop and the mop too, if I remember correctly
Edit: *Chupa-chups
I want to say Hungary because of the Rubik's cube
But I'm not sure because I think the dynamo is Belgian but I'm not so sure
For me, a lollipop is like flat and a chupa-chups is like a sphere, idk what the actual difference is actually
The brand Chupa-Chups was created in Barcelona, but I don't actually know what is the difference
I guess it's what you're used to, because in Dublin everyone eats the garlic and onion ones but I can't even put them in my mouth lol
That sounds tasty and now I'm hungry ngl
Ofc, if the English invented it, it would be the YES card
Ah, idk why I thought it was Belgian I just had that idea lol
I imagine there were i just said i call sphere lollipops chupa-chups whether they are or not
I don't actually know the difference
Maybe they were 2 separate flavours but I'm like 90% certain there was something with garlic as well, but yeah those cheese and onions were there as well and i didn't like them either
It's probably just me but I can't deal with onion I really don't like it haha
It means Subscriber Identity Module, it was just a joke lol
Oh don't mind me it was the salt and vinegar one lol I don't even know why I can't remember already it was not even a year ago
I plan on returning next year so I guess I'll have to try the cheese and onion ones again haha
People hate Bologna in Spain, it only contributed to make university to last longer (in some cases) and unnecessarily more expensive
Damn, we have the same problem in Catalan and Spanish
In Spain you can't buy any alcohol after a certain hour (8 pm
) in stores or supermarkets
You can go to a pub, though
Before Bologna, some careers were 3 years and others 5
With Bologna all are 4 years, having to waste one more year and pay one more tuitition was a Bologna thing
Also, it made masters kind of mandatory, without a master you can't do much, so more expenses added, more years wasted
Here with its implantation were removed, 4 years is the only option (well, medicine is more, students have to do the MIR and that alone is 2-5 years)
Spain had its own problems during World War II, but it's not unheard of to here someone called a facha (short for fascista)
Not WW2, but here is still used "Facha" (derivative from "Fascist") to indicate alt-right/extreme conservatives
Maybe it's because there were already before the war a term in french for the kind of people who supported the Vichy Regime: facho
Similarly in Spain, the most close term would be "facha", though it also existed before before the Civil War
I find myself lucky that English is my first language and I think a less complicated language should be the international one, maybe a Latin based one like Spanish or French
It’s even worse being a native Spanish speaker, from Spain, and finding the audio guides in Mexican
I think it should be an Esperanto-like language
Agreed
Oh, that's a good idea
It never occured to me that you guys must have the same problem with Brazil
Yeah but Quebec is always pissed anyway
Commandos
Blade The Edge of Darkness (or Severance: Blade of Darkness in some countries)
Castlevania Lord of Shadows trilogy
Metroid: Samus Returns
Maldita Castilla (Cursed Castilla)
Unepic (and the future Unmetal)
Blasphemous
Hollywood Monsters (I think it was never released outside Spain, but the sequel Hollywood Monsters 2 did, renamed as The Next BIG Thing)
La Abadia del Crimen (The abbey of crime)
Runaway series
The Sexy Brutale
And more
Apart from the already commented, Imperium was a good and old strategy game
Also more recently, Gris
The most beautiful game I have ever witnessed
Don't forget Trine, a small masterpiece
I always wondered how for a country of little more than 10M people Sweden has such a powerful cultural influence
I loved Blade
So much hours of entertainment
Gris is also developed by a Spanish company IIRC, and it is an amazing game
Rime is also an amazing game developed by tequila works Wich is spanish
Also, Gris, an indie game
95% Of your buyers are Germans tbh hahahah
>Imperium
Not spanish, it was developed by the bulgarian Haemimont Games (same studio that developed Tzar, Omerta, Tropico 3, 4 and 5, Victor Vran, Surviving Mars
Oh, I had no idea
[I asked that a long time ago] Turns out they like to wörk even as a past-time
&#x200B;
Edit: fixed a typo in work
Wait for the next DLC
Eurotruck Simulator, nazi Germany edition
Explore the most famous
Wait, I'm gonna stop this joke before it gets darker
Just
Imagine
Places that you could visit
During nazi germany
Now we are talking
Y'know places people used to go by train, ruined places
that kind of destinations
21 days smoking weed
German and French series are great because they don't censor anything
They follow their own rules and create this complex and amazing stories that get you
I can't watch any more American or TV show that does stuff for the audience instead of the story
I really liked it, and the casting of the characters was spot on
I think you won't realise that until season 3, though
It gets really complicated, but I think it is worth watching until the end, don't be discouraged
Best old age character-young age character casting I've ever seen
I loved Dark
It went a bit downhill, in my opinion, but it doesn't become bad in the slightest
I only know one person who has watched it, but I think it's not that unpopular here
Wait until season 3, it's cconfusing as fuck
I'd like to thank the French for
*Oh shit, what do I thank the French for
The Borbons
No, that cannot be it
Wine
Rioja is better
Eeeh
They left
After a while
Fuck
We'll have to go with Portugal
I'd like to thank Portugal for their towels, I guess
Now really, I don't live near neighbouring countries, so I can't really answer
Although I would like to hear from Galician people how good their relation with Portugal is, I guess there must be a lot of cooperation in some aspects that are probably wholesome
Portuguese brothers, you are cool, and had been cool with us for the most part of our history
I would like to thank Andorra for helping with the taxes ;)
Thank you Andorra for the low taxes and skii slopes
We can thank France for they help against ETA, for accepting over 400
000 people during and after the Spanish Civil War, and for accepting over 200
000 Spanish people trying to earn they life nowadays in their country
We can thank France for showing us how to strike
Amén.
> We can thank France for they help against ETA
After being a shelter for many many years
Those 400
000 were interned into labor (slave) camps with very bad conditions and treated like shit
>thanks to the communists, socialists, anarchists and democrats of all countries who came to Spain to fight fascism
Which included many French people, to be fair
They just were not endorsed by the French government officially
It's not about the quality, afaik, but more about the price
Apparently they are substantially cheaper in Portugal, so people living near the border go there to buy them
Popular ones here are Casera, used for tinto de verano and other fizzy drinks, KAS which is like lemon and orange Fanta, and Aquarius which people drink mostly for stomach upset or to rehydrate after exercise
I think they have Aquarius in some other countries too but could be wrong
I would say a lot of regions have their own
In Galicia at parties we usually drink a mix with a local red wine that is so acid that you have to mix it with soda sugar water and you drink it from small ceramic bowls
Kas (and Bitter Kas), although nowadays it's not as popular as it was years ago
An orange flavoured soda called Kas (owned by Pepsico)
I'd say:
* Kas: pretty much the same thing as Fanta, available in two flavors, orange and lemon
People usually mix it with alcohol though
* Casera: they started selling plain soda but their soda is available in lots of different flavors now
* Trina: a fruit flavored drink which is popular amongst those who don't really like fizzy drinks, it's actually based off the original recipe which was also used for the French Orangina
* Mirinda: it was very popular in the 50s/60s but nowadays it's available in many flavors and it's hard to find it in Spain
Aquarius is an international beverage with origin in Japan and itsi part of the Coca-Cola company unlike kas and casera that even if you may find them abroad, casera is sold in south America, they're Spanish
You forget Trina(ranjus) which  is popular among people who don't like fizzy beverages
Ah KAS, the perfect companion for alcoholic beverages, way better than Fanta or god forbid it, Schweppes
Also in the Canary Islands you have this gum-like drink Clipper
But never seen "non alcoholic, unique drinks" in every region
I'd say La Casera (sugared soda) is the most famous singular one in Spain, and Kas
Also the direct rival of Fanta in Spain, Trina, which brands itself as having more juice
We've got ACE juices and chinotto (called Bitter Kas) in Spain too
it's actually based off the original recipe of the French Orangina, which was made by a guy from Valencia
Had no idea Trina was Spanish, I thought they had it everywhere
It's really good
I get it from vending machines sometimes when taking the train
Completely agree, I absolutely hate this change
I find it very annoying, and would love to disable it
My computer is in english, so there are no autotranslations, but on my phone, I have it set to Spanish (because Siri, but that’s a discussion for another time)
You never quite know what is going on
E: siri and phone are set to same language for consistency
No point in having the phone half way between languages
Yes
I understand why it's a thing, but why can't it be disabled
I actually discovered an [incredible japanese youtuber] thanks to this, because I was able to read the title of the video in English, but I don't like it for the most part
I don't hate it as much as everybody else does, tho
Oh, sorry
I didn’t explain myself
Mea culpa
When I use the map, I prefer getting oral directions
However, if you have the phone set to English, it completely mangles up the Spanish names to a ludicrous degree
(Both Apple Maps and Google Maps are guilty of this, fyi)
Since, once again, I prefer hearing instructions then reading them (in a high speed metal casket
), and spending time deciphering what the hell the assistant said is a good way to miss your exit, as we say in Spanish: blanco y en botella, I set the phone to Spanish
As for why Siri in Spanish: consistency; though it does lead to facepalm moments with my laptop, as it’s still in English, but Siri’s language is synchronized everywhere, so
yeah
Also-also, since my phone is essentially an extension of my mind, I find myself thinking more in Spanish, which I find peculiar
This is great, thanks
They are in english to me because of the automatic translation, I think, because it translates to Spanish if I use spanish youtube instead of GB, which is the one I use
Look at the comment the maker pins at the top, the name of the channel to me appears as "kiwami japan" but in the comment it is in japanese
Maybe I'm wrong tho
I don't think the situation is easy here
We can joke about it, we also have that running joke of "esto con Franco no pasaba" (this wouldn't happen with Franco) but you'd have to be careful in order to make it land .On a serious approach, there's still a lot of division between "The two Spains" and any discussion that brings Franco up will likely lead to a heated argument
There's also a lot of controversy any time a political decision involving Franco is adopted
For example, the recent exhumation of Franco's body was really controversial
There's also a lot of controversy with changing the name of streets and avenues, even with looking for the unfound bodies from the civil War
Apology for Francoism is currently not a crime, but a notable amount of people would be for its criminalisation and it's somewhat likely it will be in the near future
Not tabu , but you arent gonna start a conversation with a people that you dont know asking what they think abaut Franco
Also we are so radicalised that you had to be truly carefull
In the toodler schools our kids sing about Franco having an ass white and cleaning it with bleach at the rhythm pf our anthem, not taboo at all
Unfortunately we didn't have a cut from the past (our king was appointed by Franco) so fascism still runs rampant and we still have several streets with names of either prominent fascists or fascists institutions
Generally speaking, still unpopular to speak about it
I was born in the 80s, (Franco died in the 70s) and I feel that the democratic parties that came after the dictatorship failed to create a conciliatory environment between the detractors and the related to the regime
Waving a Spanish flag or feeling "proud" of your nation colours is frown upon and you'll be tagged as far right extremist and a Franco's sympathiser
Democratic rights in Spain are still very weak and we still carry some remains of the dictatorship disguised as democracy
We have the same kind of jokes in spain
We say, with franco, this wouldnt happen
If coronavirus hits spain, with franco, this wouldnt happen
If we win the world cup, with franco this wouldnt happen
If somebody that you like or that you dont wins an election
With franco this wouldnt happen
Uh I find rare in my social circles to openly defend Franco
>Apology for Francoism
Apology means to publicly express to be sorry about something in English, while in Spanish a very similar word (apología) means to publicly express approval for something
OP is using the second definition
Just clarifying as most people in the sub won't understand this
For me, I appreciate Franco for essentially protecting us from war in WWII
The Republic would have cost us an annexation by Germany and even more lives lost
It makes me kinda sad
I keep telling myself that we need a couple more generations to forgive and forget but the political parties and the media are not helping
> in my social circles
Key expression
Unfortunately there are still a non negligible number of people who support the regime, and you can see it especially in the supporters of VOX, most are at the very least blind to the biggest flaws of the regime
It's rare to have people outright defend Franco but not people who have more "neutral" positions that border the parody of extreme centrism
For example "at least he saved us from communism", "the republicans were just as bad", "it's the past and we should just forget about it" or "it's the past and we have to respect it and move on". It doesn't help that the mainstream political right wing was founded by the moderate faction of the regime in favour of democratisation, so I guess they constantly have to find excuses as to why the party founders were Francoists before the transition
And that applies to the right-wing media or to their electorate
I live in a traditionally conservative Region and you won't really find a lot of open apologist apart from some radicalised idiots
However, a lot of people have this "well, the past is in the past" "both sides were bad" kind of discourse
And I find a lot of people that even go a little further with this "Francoism was bad because it was a dictatorship but
he created SS, I lived well, Republic was very bad, he rebuilt the country
" kind of discourse, full of half truths or direct false statements
It seems to be two Spains for everything: respect for Franco vs fuck him, right vs left, monarchy vs republic, Catholicism vs secular, liberalism vs socialism, covid lockdown is destroying our economy vs stay at home, against Basque Country or Catalonia independence vs supporters of it, even when it comes to Real Madrid vs Barça there is always a side to take despite you are fan of another team
The funny thing is lately people categorize others based on your thoughts about one of these topics and assume you are a puppet without your own opinion and judgement capacity and you have to be aligned with one segment in everything
[Yes, basically]  It's a literary expression that describes the division between different ideologies in Spain
Some authors talk about three main divisions: right vs left; catholicism vs secularism; nationalism vs regionalisms
The Civil War had a very ideological component, and the aftermath had a strong repression against the defeated side
A lot of republican or leftists had to exile or were imprisoned or killed
Due to this events there's a big polarization between left and right in our country still today, and discussing different points of view in a rational and calm way is sometimes difficult
Not always, apology also has other meanings
Apology: a reasoned argument or writing in justification of something, typically a theory or religious doctrine
The republic probably wouldn't get involved in the war until the latest stages of it, why would they defend those powers who didn't help Spain at all
Officially no
Off the records there's probably some nostalgic in the party still, but I'd say they drift further away from Franco every generation
Also, years ago Vox (far right) wasn't important so if you were a Francoist nostalgic your only real option was PP
Now if you are a Francoist nostalgic you have Vox so I guess there are less francoists in PP now
kinda
not really, as recently they've separated themselves more from the far right
I'd assume it's all about the circles you move in
In some it would be 100% unacceptable, in others I'd be no big deal
Same here in Spain with Franco tbh
&#x200B;
Edit: I'm talking about the jokes, not the fascist nostalgia lol
Time goes way too fast
The end of WWII was 76 years ago
That's a very good insight
I think there is no way to undo 40 years of control over education, culture, religion, politics and the law in a few weeks
When Franco died and the Constitution was written, we basically went to sleep one night as a dictatorship and woke up a democracy
That doesn't work
For example, high-ranking Francoist judges, policemen, mayors, politicians, public servants
all of them stayed in their posts
That's bound to have ripples
Our first democratically elected president, hailed as a hero of democracy and after whom Madrid International Airport is named, was literally the secretary-general of Franco's single party (Falange)
You are absolutely right
Mostof the first democratic politicians were already politicians before the regime change, so it's really no big surprise how it was conducted
Spaniard here
You are very on point here
Glad that you know or recent history with that depth
>they were members of Opus Dei
There's the problem
>the Catholics were actively searched for to be killed
Not really, keep in mind that most Spaniards were Catholics at this time
The Catholic priests on the other hand
It was a general sentiment among the anarchists and communists in the Popular Front that antagonising the Catholic Church was a way of fighting against oppression
Which to be fair, it kinda was, as the church in this time was still very powerful and influencial in Spain, and it was widely regarded as incredibly corrupt (which, again, it kinda was, as mostly everyone with the slightest amount of power in Spain at the time)
Obviously though, killing priests and burning churches did nothing to favor the working class, but it was a fairly common thing in the initial revolution that surged to fight the coup in its early stages
It's also important to note that, paradogically, these Anarchist and Communist revolutions were also crucial in defending the Republic in 1936, as the Government's power was extremely limited and some key areas like Catalunya were heavily reliant on the revolutionary mililtias to defend themselves against the fascist for several months after the war started
well yeah, the fact that he accepted the bribes is all to it im just glad that we stayed out of the war
But what i’m saying, not to glorify franco he wasn’t the best of a human being, the republic would have gotten us into the war and it would’ve been far worse for spanish lives
I think one of the roots of the problem is the Transición. Which was about the best thing we could get at the time to restore democracy without a bloodshed, but still incredibly bad in a lot of ways
No, not at all, only the extremist far right
Even Vox (far right) doesn't present itself as the heir of Franco and doesn't directly praise Francoism (though they indirectly do, and we all know they are quite sympathetic with him)
PP (conservative) was actually founded by Manuel Fraga, a Francoist official, but they don't like being associated with Francoism at all
If you use this "PP is the heir of Francoism" argument they will quickly fight it
However, I think they often fail in openly antagonizing Francoism, e.g. they oftenly don't vote for changing street names or other actions condemning the dictatorship (for different reasons, but the outcome is usually the same)
Not publicly but they are
The most conservative but not far right party, Partido Popular, was transformed from Alianza Popular, a party founded by a former Franco ministry, Manuel Fraga
The thing is, they do this kind of stuff
They say they are not supporters of Franco and they don't have Francoist policies (they are liberal, Franco was autarchic), but when someone propose the changing of a statue or a street they look for some twisted argument to get away like "we can't erase History" "this person that will replace the street name was even worse because blablabla" etc
Or sometimes they simply go the abstention route
So I wouldn't call them Francoist or nostalgics but you know
they are kind of passive towards it
PP is a failure in Basque Country and Catalonia indeed, but probably it's because there are conservative alternatives
In Galicia it's pretty successful however, maybe it's because nationalism isn't that strong there
However I'm not that sure about their politics because I'm not from there, so I'm basically speculating
Spanish, as long as it's Spanish of Spain
I usually play in English if the game was originally made or conceived in that language, because translators tend to be faulty in two ways: 1) in genres like fantasy we don't always have equivalents for the whole mythology, so they use approximations that might lead to confusion in the story; and 2) since Spanish usually has longer words and phrases than English, when translating menus and labels they might have to use related but not really exact alternatives just to make them fit on the screen
I always play in my language unless the translation is very bad
English always and subtitles in English
I prefer spanish when the translation is good, but due to specifics of spanish, sometimes is difficult
I play all video games in Spanish
I live in the USA and those things are small pieces that bring me home
Also, if we want companies to localize and translate contents they need to feel the need for it
People from countries like Sweden
If you don’t protect your language and demand everything to be in your language, it is going to be endangered soon
I've become used to being forced to play certain games in English, but I preffer Spanish dub as long as its not horrible
Blizzard does an excellent job with localization for instance, and a Spanish publisher called FX Interactive did an outstanding job too
In Spanish they're called Tendo and Nendo
Which I love
Spanish translation of the game is outstanding
Anyway, in that case the original is in Japanese, so you're losing stuff either way
I haven't seen a lot of video games translated into latin american spanish
It's always on TV shows or films, but never video games
edit: too much spanglish
It's interesting because with movies and series I always default to English
But with videogames I do play in Spanish mostly
With the exception of Paradox's games becasue the translation is lackluster,  to say the least
Here in the Basque Country, we see people from the countryside as the strong rough neighbors who lift 200kg stones every day, fight wolves, live in those enormous houses and speak an inteligible Basque
When people from the rest of Spain stereotype us (from the cities) they use the same ones
SOME people from major cities make really rude remarks about the rest of the country already, let alone the "hicks" and "goatf\*\*\*rs" from rural areas
guess it depends
People from rural areas are way more conservative too, while generally speaking urban areas are more pogressive
Here in Spain, a lot of urban people think we are are rednecks, and in Galicia, they think we are cocaine addicts and goatfuckers, while they think that people from Basque Country are Spain's russians
Yet they come here on vacations, and they stand out A LOT, they dress like they think we dress, coming like they own the place
In their defense, everyone thinks they're assholes
I live in rural Galicia and can confirm that there's more than one cocaine addict goat fucker
Thought it is true that cocaine is more prevalent in the cities
True
Friend of mine went to Colombia, and got busted in the airport with a 1kg cocaine brick, and now is in a colombian prison in fuck knows where and he got himself a phone to tell everyone where he was
Do you feel that the languages you already speak are not "enough"?
When I couldn't speak English I used to think, "if English speakers do not feel the need to learn languages, then neither will I —  for I will speak English plus Spanish".
But since I am able to speak English, I have been feeling that it is not enough
Have you also felt the same
I can speak 4 languages and a bit of a 5th, I love the process of learning a language but I am too pefectionist
I can’t allow myself to learn more lengauges because I would want to spend many hours a day with grammar books
I need to focus on my career
I really want next summer to come so I can study the C2 level of German, that’s my level of craziness for languages
I had that feeling long ago, when i was young
i took classes of chinese, french and German at the same time
That's when i learned keeping Up a language recquires a lot of effort and contact
In the end i forgot everything i had learned
I just didn't practice enough
However I still think about It
Now i have a more practical approach
I want to live abroad, so when i decide where i'll learn the language with gusto
That doesn't mean someone can't learn a language without that push, of course they can
It just means that i've found keeping Up the language to be the hardest part for me and so i give it priority
One of the reasons why I feel it is not enough is because I somewhat feel *trapped*, boldly speaking
For example, if I were to move to other country (that is in the EU), I could only move to Ireland and Malta knowing only English
So I thought about what language to learn and got to the conclusion that it'll be French
Apart from  France being my neighbour country, I decided to learn it because of all the culture and the literature it has
I love reading, so if I knew French I could read French novels in their language and reach to content that I couldn't be able only speaking Spanish and English
>And when I get angry, I usually curse/think in Spanish
It makes sense
I think I only need to say that I am from Spain, so
As of today in Madrid, YES
I measured [32cm on the handrail of my balcony] this morning
I believe this is the most snow in the history of Madrid, and it’s still snowing
Edit: I realize this is completely out of context because I missed the word _lanterns_ . Facepalm
Double edit, since we’ve already gone down that path, here’s some more pics from [a walk around Madrid today]
I'm 33 years old and in all those years I've seen snow twice in my hometown
I hope this answers your question
Here in Spain the majority of population doesn't experience snow often
I didn't know about these lamps
The country, generally speaking, isn't prepared for snow storms
I won't have the pleasure
I live in the coast of Granada, there is no snow here
Seems like you've seen the news of Madrid having 30cm snow, it's the big news here now
It's more common to have snow in the mountains, regardless of latitude (even in the Teide volcano, in Tenerife, and also Sierra Nevada (lit
: snowy mountains)), and in the northern half of the peninsula
Haha exactly
Well, most shops are closed, there’s 0 traffic, even around the city center, and people are walking around drinking beers literally in the middle of the streets
The city is completely unprepared for this, which isn’t surprising because at least to my knowledge, this has never happened before
I know they are snow plowing the main highways, but the streets in the city are still completely covered in snow
Busses and taxis aren’t running today, it would be impossible to order from Uber eats for example, but the metro (subway) is still running
The public seems to love it, it’s such a novelty
I saw so many snow men out on my walk, so many parents pulling their kids down the street in sleds, and everyone seemed to be in a pretty joyful mood about it
I heard a lot of people saying things like “this is incredible
Yeah it is lucky it happened during the weekend
The city is already weakened by covid and something like this during the week would bring the city to its knees
at least it’s semi temporary but it’s supposed to be below -10 on Monday and Tuesday night so I guess it will all turn to ice
Lockdowns in Madrid right now depends on which neighborhood you’re in, my neighborhood along with _most_ of the rest of the city isn’t locked down [this website] has a map
It didn't explode, but 4 nukes fell in Spain during WW2, by accident, plutonium is still on the land and Spain has requested since then to USA to remove it
The UK, my adoptive country
What can I say
The thought of leaving you later this year makes me tear up
Portugal is so beautiful and Portuguese people are so lovely
Underrated country
Our brothers from another mother, we have so much to learn from you
Italy, also a brother from another mother, visiting you is like visiting a warm, quirky grandma that won't let me go until she's sure I've eaten enough
I feel at home in Italy
**Portugal,** I know it might seem like we don't care about you and usually act like the we're the only ones in the peninsula, but you are our brothers and we think you are really cool
**Italy**, our other brothers, you have a beautiful country and even though we like to brag about our food, yours is equally fantastic
**France,** yes
we think you are alright despite all our battles in sports
Google translate told me you just called my grandmother a bicycle cause everybody rides on it
I'm going down there and stealing your cod, caralho
Despite our mutual jokes I defend Portugal over any country in every conversation
We really think you are the coolest neighbros any country could ever ask for
The historical friendship between our countries is renewed every year in the Eurovision contest
For real though, even though you use way too many vowels for us to understand what you're saying we are fairly sure that you guys are nice
I love Portugal, I really do
Having lived all my life in Spain, I have only really heard bad things about France but never Portugal
I am actually considering moving there some day
From Spain
You're welcome, you need good vitamins to grow strong
Thank you Austria for being such a nice and beautiful country, the nature you have is impressive and your cities take your breath away, and you have an exciting medieval history
Dear Portugal,
We couldn't ever ask for a friendlier neighbor
We sound loud and annoying because every time we visit you, we are in complete awe
I wish we could learn more about Portuguese history and customs in our classes to get to know you better as it's, sadly, vastly disregarded
We envy you in lots of things and we always talk about how we should improve the same way you are doing
Sincerely, Iberian bro
Yeah, we know
After living in the UK for some time I've come to know your typical hooligans and I've learnt to discern them from the polite and nice British (easy to diferentiate them honestly)
We also have AH here but  luckily they tend to stay in our country
By the way beers aren't enough, turism is regretfully destroying my country while getting a few people rich but that's not your fault
The feeling goes both ways fratello mio
You got yourself a deal
In the meantime we are saying this we are moving the border stones a couple km to the West
Oh no
Had no idea
The thing is, we all are mostly nice people, and we envy you a lot
Portugal has had an awesome development and every time your country appear on our news we sigh deeply, daydreaming how could we do the same if we weren't ashamed of out politicians all the time
Southern Spain too, many more we could expect I guess
The thing is your style of pizza in Chicago I'm sure it's fucking amazing but we do an abomination of it
Same way Chinese food or kebabs are awful in most European countries and when you try the real deal it's delicious
I love drinking milk, particularly cold from the fridge in summer
So refreshing and filling
I can relate with you
I love drinking milk too
I drink minimum two glasses a day
People think is strange
Not because I drink milk but because I prefer just pure white cold milk instead of milk with chocolate or anything in it
I only have milk in my tea or coffee
Or cereal on the rare occasion I have cereal for breakfast
Used to love it when I was a kid, though
Milk in Spain isn’t great for drinking, IMO
I hate drinking just milk, milk with chocolate all the way, but just and only milk, yikes no
Im not a dairy guy in general
Cheese grossed me out, except on pizza
Yogurt and creamy things are not for me either
I’ll take a splash of milk in my coffee and that’s about it
Wait, wait, this is interesting
What kind of anise
A liquor
Please elaborate
I have anise seeds
I will make this tonight
Thank you for the recipe
EDIT: Formatting
There's a lot of ways to say that something is very far away
I'm not sure if there's something that specifically means in the middle of nowhere
Some expressions that I can think of (and literal translations) are:
Está en el culo del mundo (It's in the butt of the world)
En el quinto pino (In the fifth pine) This one has an origin story
Está a tomar por culo/a tomar vientos (It's to take it in the butt/ to take winds)
Donde dios perdió el mechero (Where god lost his lighter)
I'll edit if I can think of something more
We have many expressions but my favourite it's en el quinto pinto(in the fifth pine), could also be a tomar por culo which it translates weirdly as, something like where ypu take the ass, it doesn't really make much more sense in spanish but translated it's even worse
"Where Jesus lost the lighter" is a fun one used here
In Spanish we say _a tomar por culo_.. i guess the equivalent in English is “in the ass end of nowhere”
You can also say _donde Cristo perdió su mechero_ (where Jesus lost his lighter) why he lost his lighter, instead of his sandles, like in English, I don’t know
but you can also say “where Jesus lost his sandles” and that works too
In the Canary Islands I've heard "está en Cancún"
Which is "it's in Cancún" (a city in Mexico)
"Donde Cristo perdió el mechero"
Meaning Where Jesus Christ lost the lighter
It's obvious he didn't smoke but we use this sentence
Irse a Cuenca (Going to Cuenca)
Irse al quinto pino (Going to the fifth pine tree)
Irse a tomar por culo (Going to get assfucked)
It’s the same in Spanish _a tomar por culo_
Also, "en el quinto coño" (in the fifth cunt)
The less polite version of "En el quinto pino".
I heard all those except the Dios perdió el mechero
I also heard a lot "in Cuba" to refer yo somehting far, and "Where christ lost his sandals"/Donde Cristo perdió las sandlias, which is hilarious
Also Conchinina, corresponding to more or less Vietnam
>Donde dios perdió el mechero (Where god lost his lighter)
I never heard of that before
But I've heard of "Donde Napoleón perdió el gorro" (Where Napoleon lost his hat)
Edit: there's also "Estar alejado de la mano de Dios" (To be far away from God's hand)
I know an older expression that I still use: está en Sebastopol (it's in Sevastopol)
Sevastopol is an Ukrainian city
Along with Cochinchina and Pernambuco are old expressions used with real places on them
A bit outdated, but I have also heard, and I use it often because I like it "Está en Pernambuco" ("It's in Pernambuco", a region in Brazil)
Now that I think about it, I know about that mainly through Ibáñez's comics
I don't know if he coined the expression himself or only made more popular something that already existed
The most common I've heard are "está en Parla" = "it's in Parla" in Comunidad de Madrid
And "a tomar por culo de aquí" = I don't know how to translate it but it isn't very polite
One I've heard in the Canary Islands is "está en Cancún"
> I heard all those except the Dios perdió el mechero
I know it as *donde Cristo perdió el mechero* rather
I always thought it was "Donde Cristo perdió el gorro" intead of Napoleon
I have heard a different version of this one, " Donde Napoleón se cansó de andar " (where Napoleón got tired of walking)
"Vete a Parla" (Go to Parla) or "A mamarla a Parla" (Go to Parla to suck) is definitely an used expression here in Madrid (meaning f\*ck off)
I’ve always heard _donde Cristo perdió su mechero_
Why Jesus had a lighter
I don’t know
Precisely because he was a child slave living in a fucking desert planet where you had a deadly sandstorm almost every day
Id hate sand too
Besides, he is right: sand IS rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere
My case is close to yours
Family intern, working on ER (in spain doesent exist EM specialization, and family physicians are the ones who work in ER)
Also with aunto-inmune desease taking anti-TNF biological meds
In my hospital we work with surgical masks and no protective glasses unless we are facing high suspected case
For that cases we had to wear the full EPI with ffp2 masks, and that kits start to be in lack of stock
I have two partners already infected isolated in their homes, one is pregnant
Im afraid ill catch it very soon, my ER is a chaos, sustainable at the moment, but a chaos
Hahaha I guess we share same desease, with same treatment, same speciality and i guess also we are close each other, bc i work in Pontevedra (Galicia)
Lets see what will happen next days, but looks pretty bad
Good luck Irmao, Boa sorte para ti tamén!
We also eat snails lol
The inquisition
I don't know why is It called the spanish inquisition if even Liechstenstein killed more people than us
OP in Portugal the torero doesn't fight to the death, I think that's the reason your bullfighting is not so famous
I am not entirely famliar with the Inquisition but I recently read they weren't as bloody as our modern picture tends to depict them
Apparently their actions on "heretics" were pretty lenient, **obviously** in relation to the savagery of the period
I think it said it was mostly taxes and decreased privileges, people were always given the chance to "repent" and convert before stronger measures were taken, and killing people would only be done in extreme cases were the person wouldn't budge in their convictions
I'm obviously not trying to defend the fucking Inquisition lol, but to put it into perspective, witch burning in central Europe, and the whole Catholic/Protestant cleansing was way more brutal and extreme than the crimes of the Spanish Inquisition
Inquisition:
> According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three-century duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed (~2
7% of all cases)
Witch hunts:
> The classical period of witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America took place in the Early Modern period or about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 100,000 executions, with the most recent estimate at 40,000
Those chocolate things you put on your toasts are actually very nice
Same here
Do we
Nope, you're infamous for creating and controlling for centuries the triangular slave trade routes
In the south though
Heh heh heh
*saddens as ww2 flash backs happen*
In the middle too
I think it's possible that they don't talk that much about it because afaik the English themselves brought their slaves to North America
But most of the African slaves in the Spanish Americas were sold by the Portuguese and I think any Spaniard who knows a bit about history knows that
In the north too
I guess it would also be too expensive to switch to metric and having to change everything from road signs and billboards to scales
Even then, it personally gets on my nerves that the main Western cultural producer is also the only one who doesn't use metric (why do I have to google what 6 feet means in metres or how much kg 80 pounds are whenever I read an American book or watch an American series
Lazy translators who don't bother to pass them to metric don't help)
It's just a pet peeve of mine, but still
In the East too
I don't know about other European cities, but here in Spain it's not that rare to live in a 10-storey building
Our cities may not have huge CBDs, but they're quite dense already
Here in Spain we have those laws too
Listos o no ¡allá voy
Though if you mean when playing hide and seek, when "it" has stopped counting then you usually shout: "Ronda ronda, quien no se haya escondido que se esconda"
It translates as "Ronda ronda, whoever hasn't hidden go hide" It loses it's rhyme :(
"¡Listos o no, allá voy
" A literal translation
Listo o no, ¡allá voy
First time I've ever heard that sentence
Where I live we just shouted "Y CIEN
" (and a hundred) really loud
Also, you can translate "ronda" to "rounds" as in patrol rounds, which I think makes sense in the context of hide and seek
Where I live we say "Preparado o no, allá voy".
Same
And the person counting would skip numbers, like ... 55, 56, 57 and 100
Where I live we say
"Quien no se haya escondido, tiempo ha tenido"
This Is the real one
Not at all, it makes communication much easier if we both try to adapt our vocabulary
Spanish vocabulary can be really different depending on the country
Accents are different
I don't like it much when people from regions with *seseo* (American Spanish speakers and Southern Spanish speakers, who use the sound S for Z too) try to use *distinción*.
Distinción is standard Spanish from Spain, where Z and S are pronounced differently, but non native speakers of this variety always get the sounds wrong and it's a bit annoying
It makes it seem like they don't know which one is which and that they probably have bad orthography regarding those two
It's not really that bad, just a bit unnerving
I wouldn't mind either way, I used to consume tons of Latin American media so I know some slang from pretty much everywhere
I would not mind if they use my words or their own
Actually if they use their own I could learn something and we could have a laugh when we start to misunderstand each other on silly things haha
Talking about spanish
It's not that big of a deal, each place has it's own way of speaking
People from South América make fun of the way we refer to other people, while we make fun of their accent
no i dont care
it can be dificult sometimes but its fine
It's really weird when I hear a latino talking Spanish, but since both side of the ocean are connected with Internet I'm getting used to it
As an Andalusian person, when I was growing up I would be bothered because of this s/z exchange
Specially in my home town Cadiz is quite common for people to mix it in both directions (Z --> S and S --> Z) and as in my family we have "neutral" accent, I used to be very confused with this z/s thing as a child
Sometimes this accent (and probably others) make your native language seem like stolen, like they are not using your toy as it deserves, but I came to terms with this feeling and now I am actually in love with how maleable languages can be and how beautiful it is the bond created by sharing your mother tongue language
They do the same to spaniards anyways
Wow, today I learned
I had no idea fake Spanish people were a thing
There are Spanish people that do this here, though, mostly people from the south, so some may not be that fake haha
It always seemed like a silly thing to do in my opinion
Seseo is just as beautiful as distinción and failing at distinción may make people notice you even more
I dunno
My best friend (Andaluz) basically forced me to start differentiating because he thought it sounded bad otherwise
I'm very comfortable either way: I speak with seseo to family and with differentiation to everyone else
Well, your teacher probably shouldn't be teaching much then
I've heard Mexicans have a lot of trouble with their X too, because some foreign people will insist on pronouncing it always as an X instead of using a J for the right words
They're just regional variations, each country has their own and none of them is wrong
Americans learned the to pronounce the "z" wrong
Spanish comes from Spain, the rest of the countries learned it (wrong)
Spaniards wsre more focused into getting the gold from America rather than teachimg Spanish properly
Here a common struggle for students of Spanish
Spanish really is SUPER hard lol like I am a native speaker from Spain but trying to explain the grammar rules and sintaxis to non speakers just baffles me
I’m glad I learned English is much easier in my opinion
Yeah, English verbs are definitely easier
English pronunciation is quite hard, though, there's a lot of sounds that are written differently depending on the word
And there aren't really that many rules about it that you can learn
You basically have to memorize each word
Oh, sure, jokes are fine
It's just there's Spanish speakers that actually mean that stuff, and it doesn't show much knowledge about the topic
You got then an important milestone there
Haha
A hard one when you’re learning, at least for my friend was: “Pon lo que te sobre en el sobre sobre la mesa”
It is like why
Haha
Franco did it to have the same schedule as the third reich and it just never got changed back
The reality is that i think we like it
It's fucked up but we love that at 9:00pm the sun still shines in summer
we are outdoorsy and we enjoy that
but yeah our schedule is fucked up
Coincidentally, my great grandfather (born before Franco's dictatorship) used to say he got up at 5 am with the sun, and that now we were lazy and woke up late
It probably has more to do with the change of time than lazyness, as time changed, people weren't going to get up at 5 am and wait 2 hours for the sun to come up and work the farm in the dark
I always thought they really did get up super-early, but 5 am was the equivalent of 7 am
Anyway, as i've always lived like this it's weird to go to other countries where people have different timetables
I'm not sure what time you have lunch in Portugal, when i went we ate at home, but in Spain we have lunch at 2pm the earliest, and it's odd to adapt to eating at 1pm
The only thing I truly dislike about Portugal is the remaining classism
And the lack of Lemon Fanta, but that's a completely different conversation
I live in Galicia and I totally agree
It's so weird when in June there's still daylight at about 10
30 pm, but the sun does not rise until 7 am
We should be a couple hours behind
The problem is, we're so used to this now, we have developed some habits (late meals, sleeping, and social habits) so changing is difficult
I think you probably know this but Spain's timezone got changed by dictator Franco just to be in sync with the axis
Because we are used to it now, changing it again would bring a lot of problems in the everyday life
I love my 11
00 pm summer daylight on the West coast
it's fun to go to class in winter, it's still nightime/sunrise outside lmao
Only for like twenty minutes at most but it still catches my attention every time
I can't get used to that
Especially in places like Galicia
To be honest, when you eat outside and have a great lunch time and the weather is just perfect, warm with a soft breeze, you really feel in the mood to lay down and do nothing
World: I don't understand why everyone thinks all Spaniards take a siesta, hahaha
Personally, neither I nor anyone around me sleeps siesta
I don't want to say that nobody takes a siesta either
Many people do it occasionally in summer when at 15:00 pm and +35° you can only sleep or die (electricity here is very, very expensive, air conditioning is not always an option hahaha)
Also students in times of intensive study, or workers with split hours who need to renew their energy (it is very common that the working day is from 9:00-14:00 with two or three hours to eat at home with the family and return to work at 16:00 or 17:00 and keep working until 20:00 p.m.)
So for the people who do it, the nap is a matter of survival
It is not late if you use the sun as a reference, it just says a different number in the clock
Not as late but later than most yeah
We have a pretty fucked up schedule
Which is super nice for weekends and summer but terrible for weekdays
And absolutely, the timezone affects our habbits
Spanish winter is the kind of wet cold to get in your bones, at least on the West Coast
How is it in Ireland
Well, during the day we have a massive lunch a and at least me I sleep like at 16:00 for like an hour or two
It’s not necessarily hot we can take high 30s jaja
People from northern/central europe are aways so worried about going to sleep wuth a full stimach and i don't understand why haha
It must be some grandma legend stuff
Dinners here tend to be light so idk we are used to it
And people go to sleep at 23:30-12
So yeah
[Fries toast
You don't say a thing about the important issue, the Lemon Fanta
Yeah, that's right
The sun is usually coming up at 8
30-9 in winter, so it feels so much sooner
Yes
As you can see in this [chart] our schedule is not that out of the ordinary, just the numbers in the clock are shifted
23:30 more or less
Our schedule is fucked up tbh
Most people work until 7 so everything runs late
On weekends and summer it's nice though
But then When we party is like we start at 12:00-5:00 and that's sooo late
> What is weird to me is how long your lunch break is
Instead of it having 2 hours make it one hour and be home one hour earlier, seems the better option to me honestly
Yes
This is the real oddity in our schedule that is actually related to our culture
I hate it, but I understand why we have it
Lunch is the most important meal of the day for us, schools close at that hour and parents go pick up their children
Many people commute home just to eat, a problem is that if you can't, you have to wait that extra time because your workplace gets closed
Breakfast is really light here: Coffee, orange juice and maybe some toast with some olive oil and crusshed tomatto on it
That's it
The big meal is lunch
In Spain the correction fluid is called "tipex" because of the name of the brand "tipp-ex".
An edible candy on a stick is called "Chupa chups" because of the brand of the same name (in English is called lollipop)
Mnay are shared with English but others come from Spanish brands or foreign brands that are more popular here
-Nocilla, which is kinda like our Nutella
-Kleenex for paper tissues
-Coca-Cola for all colas
-Polo (Spanidh brand) for all popsicles
-Termo (Thermo)
-Frisbi (Frisbee)
-Aspirina (Aspirine)
-Jacuzzi for all hot tubs
-Ping-pong for table tennis
-Post-it for adhesive notes
-Pladur for plasterboards in construction
Tipp-ex is also used in Spain
tempo is almost never used in austria so i got very confused when i first heard a northern neighbor say it :)) usually i would say kleenex but i think that comes from my spanish side
otherwise just taschentuch
sad Nesquik noises
schwedenbomben xD
Gomina es una marca
Me siento engañado
Following the same example, in Spanish we use the word “cometa” for both “kite” and “comet”.
In spanish we have a few
In the 90% of the cases one of the meaning is "penis
Not really two meanings, but the word "cojones" (men balls)  in spanish has a shitload of different meanings depending on what word is preceded of succeeded by
There is a nice text on this (in spanish) by Perez-reverte, one of the best Spanish writers,
But it's *un cometa* (a comet) vs *una cometa* (a kite)
Tiene nombres mil, tiene nombres mil, tiene nombres mil, el miembro viril
r/Hornyjail ?
I once went to UK and there was a Spaniard frying some sausages in the middle of the street with a mini-grill
(It was near one of the main bridges, but can't remember which one)
When I went to see the Alhambra for the first time, I saw three different tourists in the Palacios Nazaríes touching the [plaster walls] like it was nothing
I spoke up about it to let them know it's not ok
I was surprised how blatant it was because they would start touching the walls right in front of everyone, even security monitors
Tourists eating oranges from the ornamental trees in Spanish towns, particularly Sevilla
They are not for eating as their bitter mouths discover a second after the fact
Tbf this is not a tourist-only issue
Many people are stupid like that on a regular basis
Just a couple of days ago a couple of ~50 years old men were in line for the bus just before me and as soon as they paid the driver they walked 3 steps and stopped literally in the middle of the corridor blocking anybody coming after them
And they knew I and other people were in line after them
I "politely" pointed the obvious with a "sir" and one of them obliviously apologized and moved aside
I can sort-of read French but if you speak it to me it's impossible
The spelling is there but the noises, like you said, are too different
canyo not
We call "Las provincias" for everything outside Barcelona and Madrid
In Spain we call it "el extrarradio" (the outskirts) but it is used for territories outside the center of the country, not just limited to the capital
It is derogatory: "de provincias".. from the provinces
Tho Barcelona equals Madrid in this case and it's not "province". As this makes reference to a more rural-not big city
Outside those big cities
It is
Same in Spain, "provincianos" is used by the people of Madrid to talk about the rest of the country
The stereotype of smug assholes is also the same
Never heard of that and I live in Madrid
I don't think in Spain it is really that common to group all the country except Madrid in a single statement
You mostly hear people talk about levante, the cantabric/North, the South, the meseta, the peninsula
I've never heard that, but then again I don't live in any of those cities so maybe that's why
In fact, I think if someone talked to me about "las provincias" I would have no freaking clue what they were talking about lol
I'd say it's not actually the same
We wouldn't call someone from San sebastian provinciano
I think it's less about the capital and more about a Big city
That way Barcelona is not included and "metropolitan" cities neither
Its mostly used for what is Generally perceived as small or "backwards" places
I think there's also a level of contrast
my aragonese friend would call anyone from anywhere in Aragon but  Zaragoza provinciano
I have a stepbrother in Extremadura and for him Plasencia, his home city, marks the limit on what's provinciano
I think Its more a somewhat peyorative term for "Camp folk" or anyone living in a smaller city than you
Barcelona is a big city
So does not apply to it
The term is used mainly towards people from small towns, no one would say that people from Barcelona are "provincianos".
Well, the attitude towards Barcelona and Cataluña (the region where Barcelona is) tends to be different but because of the whole independence issue there
Still, it tends to be a negative perception, although "provincianos" can be the people from Cataluña that are not from Barcelona
of course not everyone, but believe me I know people who wouldn't hesitate in calling someone from San Sebastián "provinciano"...it doesn't have any logic but it's not me who needs that explained
I think that's less the case nowadays but i may be wrong
I hope it's the less case as well, and it's just a small group that makes lots of noise you know
It happened to me in every country I've gone to, I think lol
The best one was in the UK, during an exchange
Our teacher was English, but she knew Spanish and we had no idea for at least the first 3-4 days
It was very funny when she said something in Spanish for the first time
It was shocking, and everyone started to freak out about what they may have said in front of her
Specially those who knew they said something mean about her xd
Such a double edge sword speaking openly about stuff when you think they won't understand you
It also happened to me with cashiers or baristas (? It was at a Starbucks, and I don't know how to call the people making the coffee) in Dublin, Frankfort and Toronto
Those moments were mostly cool, unlike the UK one that was embarrassing xd
I saw your user flag with my yellow screen night light activated and thought: *Austria
Isn't that Spain
Haha, what a bunch of bs
(Pun absolutely intended)
Spain is the same tbh
It is basically in our dna to shit on our country
The thing is, most people are only aware about the life they're living and focus on the shitty things
I grew up in Spain and I fucking hated it and was dreaming of moving to a more civilized place with better job opportunities
Well, after living 10 years in Germany, I'm often complaining about weather, food, language barriers, humour, etc and fantasizing about the life I had next to the Mediterranean
When I'm "all namaste" I think that each place has something to offer and we should enjoy it as is
but that doesn't happen every day
It's tradition at this point  But if you are an outsider and talk shit about this country prepare yourself
Both
By the way, in Catalan "God" and "10" are the same word: "Deu"
We shit on god, diez (ten), a whore/golden whore, the sea/salty sea, milk, your/our fucking mother, your/our fucking skull, your fucking dead (relatives), etc
Your imagination is the limit
Oh I know I know
I wasn't talking about you, just in general
I think in Spain you can wear whatever you want in some cities, but in others people are really posh
People are expected to wear nice clothes in public in general, so they may judge you a bit negatively if you don't fit in at all
Spaniard in London here
I think in general people don't dress that differently from people in, say, Madrid (another big capital), but there are differences, of course
I think you can find super well-dressed people in London, in two different ways: the elegant, posh ones, and the original, interesting ones
But then, depending on which area of London you are in, things change
There are areas where you see more of the sweatpants, hoodies, caps and gold chains kind of style, and other areas where everyone dresses really posh, but in a very uninteresting, uniform way
When it comes to going out, it also depends on the area
There's the hipster areas, the alternative areas, the areas where you see all those scantily clad girls in sub zero temperatures, with a ton of make up on, etc
I think these last ones stand out a lot because this is specifically a UK/Ireland phenomenon, as far as my experience in Europe goes, and there are many of them
But it's certainly not how everyone dresses
I do feel that there are more of the sweatpants, hoodies, etc
kind in the UK, compared to Spain
In Spain, there is this thing where people from some small towns try really hard to "dress well" (or their idea of what dressing well is) every day, for every ocassion
I feel this is the same in Italy as well, but my experience is limited
However, my opinion is that they sometimes overdo it in a "cheap" kind of way that immediately gives away they are from a small town (not that being from a small town is bad in any way
I agree with you, Dutch dress amazingly well
I cannot say the same about the Germans though
Oh yes, especially in Tübingen, white shirts are kind of an indicator of fraternities/ "Burschenschaft", which is very right leaning organisations or they assumed that you majored in economics, who sometimes are a bunch of bricks (not to stereotyp, but I study with them I know what I am talking about)
The perfume or aftershave thing at least for me is something I can't do
I hate them as they give me terrible headaches
I sometimes smell the person ten minutes after they left
To feel *uncomfortablely colorful* is a thing and I discovered it the first time I went to Germany
You don't need a Passport, you can just cross with your country ID, also there's no land frontier, so they're not going to ask for that ID
Yes you can travel freely inside the Schengen zone
There is no physical border and no passport control
If you have a EU passport, you can also legally live and work in the other EU countries without needed any sort of Visa, which is pretty dope
I'm French by I lived for a few years in the UK (before Brexit) and now I live in Spain
You still have to deal with bureaucracy and paperwork, but you are free to live where you want
That was a game changer
It feels so good to travel to another country and just keep the internet, it may sound stupid, but it make me feel "closer" to other EU countries
spanish language has around 4k words from arab language
some of them coming not from just words but from gramma, for example the femenine "the" (al or a) from arab it is now directly embebed in the word
ie: albaricoque - apricot; aceituna - olive
i know this could not be surprising but to me just looks beatiful, dont know why
My favorite in spanish is CHUMINO
Which is a very colloquial way to name the pussy/cunt
Apparently it comes from back in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the port of Malaga was one of the busiest and where many English ships arrived to load and unload
Crossing a street from their usual exercise rooms, the prostitutes would come out to wait for them at the port and when they sighted a boat they “received” the crew lifting their skirts
Over time, the authorities began to persecute this practice and the girls who were waiting in the port had to find ways to hide their welcome to the ships about to dock
Meanwhile on the ships, the English sailors accustomed to greeting with their skirts raised shouted to the ladies "SHOW ME NOW
". So in Spain "Showmenow" became in "Chumino" and now is a very popular word of our vocabulary
I love that this happens between the spanish languages:
Galician:  Pavo
Euskera:  Indioilar (Indian rooster)
Catalan: Gall d'indi (Indian rooster)
Spanish: Pavo (it is also the name of the Peacock (Pavo Real), so it probably comes from there)
Edit: The Euskera one was wrong and it seems that also the Galician one
DIEEE GOOOGLEEEEEE YOUR TRANSLATOR SUCKS
Edit2: Ok, so I don't know why, but google translate is not able to translate pavo from Spanish to a lot of languages, I've been checking and in a lot fo cases he decides to translate "Pavo" as "Turkey \[in the specific language\]", it's like the translator is first translating to English and then to the other language (this seems like the most logical answer)
So for example Spanish-Finnish =  Turkki, Spanish-Turkish =  Türkiye, etc
So sorry about the misinformation
> Spanish: Pavo (it is also the name of the Peacock (Pavo Real), so it probably comes from there)
It's actually the other way around
The original *pavo* is the *pavo real* (peacock)
After the *pavo* (turkey) was introduced they renamed the original *pavo* to *pavo real* because that's the "real" turkey
It's a bit counter intuitive because they renamed the original instead of the new one
But I'd say it's because the new one became more popular because it could be eaten, so they renamed the original, albeit less popular one
In some LatAm countries, it's called brasier, if it wasn't enough
What you are saying is right, but are you sure about the "real" part
For me pavo real mean "Royal peacock", not "real peacock".
Oh, sorry, you're right
I didn't knew the Basque one so I used google translate and it's giving the wrong answer
I will edit it
That's a common misconception because it's easy to assume *real* means royal
It makes sense right
Peacocks are flashy, elegant, royal
But no, it was named *real* as in "real" (*verdadero*) for the reasons I explained
Just research for a bit and you'll find what I say is true
I'd say one of the regional languages
Probably catalán as most of the Eastern coast either speak it or use a similar language/dialect
Followed by Basque and then Gallego
In Spain it must be french
When you reach secondary school (at 11, it's like 7th grade) you have to choose another language besides english, and french is the most popular one because people think it would be easier than others like german
If you mean native speakers
I honestly have no idea
I guess excluding all the other official languages (catalan, basque, gallego
) it would be French as a foreign language because it was learnt in school in the past, over english; and as native language maybe Romanian or *Arabic* as Romanians and Moroccans are the biggest immigrant groups in Spain
Here Spain
Oh this question is hard
especially for us but that makes the answer much more interesting
First off we have to get clear what you Meam by second language
As i see there are two ways of interpreting this:
1) you're asking us to ignore the mother tongue
2) you're asking us to ignore the most used tongue
That distinction IS IMPORTANT in our case
So lets go with 1) according to the INE (national estadistic institute) the most common second language amongst people between 18 and 64 is english
with a whopping 40% of speakers . Which means they're roughly counting everyone Who knows how to "defend" themselves
I'm telling this because they also assume 14% of people can speak french which puts It in first possition
This is almost as ludicruous as the 40% thing
which means that i'm going to ignore french though It has a higher percentage of "speakers" because of the abismal quality of the speakers they're counting
According to the study spain's most common second language (understood as not-the-mother-tongue and ignoring the previously satated "overstatement" in the study) is
SPANISH with 9
1% of the speakers
Confused
Well, Spain has about 5 million inmigrants and many don't have spanish as their native tongue
Furthermore there's catalan with around 5 million native speakers
which translates to 5 million second tongue spanish speakers
To that you have to add gallician and euskera native speakers
That's a lot of people
2) i Won't do it
this would be hell to Search for
because as far as i know we don't take that viewpoint in statistics
It may be french
but i would still bet for catalan
There's some people Who have just taken out the first language of the country and talked about the second
Spain's largest second language would be
no surprise catalan
BUT if you want the simpler answer more in tune  with the rest
french
it's by far the most taught language apart from english and the official and cofficial languages of Spain
Almost nobody talks It right but many know some basics
I for one studied french for 5 years and couldn't mantain even the simplest of conversations
I did French as extra language, still, I know nothing about French
The first one sure
The second one might be true but its much Closer that you make It seem
There are around 5 million non native catalan speakers
english IS harder to count as most census are seriously overstating our english but i wouldn't say less than 10% of our population which is 4 million (when excluding Catalonia)
It all depends on  what level of profficiency you're setting the bar at
I was about to say this
There's about 5 million native catalan speakers alone
and they all speak spanish (i think It was 98%)
well, yeah
it's true that I was counting only the languages that are not native from one's country (like catalan, basque, gallego
), but if we count them it would be catalán, yes
it depends on the school that they let you choose italian or not, and they are a minority
I personaly can speak some italian thanks to apps like duolingo, and surely if I did an erasmus in Italy I could learn it much better, I guess it's the same for the spaniards that you know
I'm curious about something (as I see that you are from Catalonia): isn't spanish and catalan "at the same level"? I mean that even if you choose to speak catalan as much as you can, don't you still need to speak and read spanish often
Making it both your "first language".
I mean for example talking to friends not from Catalonia of reading through mobile apps, in the street
I there's about 5 million native catalan speakers whose second language is spanish
There's also 5 million non-native catalan speakers but if you add all the inmigrants in the country Who have learned spanish i'd say spain's largest second language is well
spanish
That's a bit twisted, don't you think
I think by second language he meant anything but the native tongue
If not the whole thing gets really murky really fast
how do you count large inmigrant groups which now speak spanish
their language is now second
The language they speak with their family
how do you get statistics about how much catalan a person speaks in their day to day
And where do you put the boundary
Almost all them speaks spanish as a first language and then the regional as a second
Maybe not in the towns of Catalonia and Baleares
I am valencian and my first language is spanish
Ive been in Baleares, Basque Country and Galicia and I barely heard other language than spanish
We all know the basics
But that's it
Stuff like excel or anything fancy that's not changing colour to letters or fort size on word is a mystery
We had some courses at university and people struggled a lot
Yet all of the French people I know could make you a proper excel file about whatever
probably more than previous generations
But most people just use the computer as facebook machine or even the ones using it as a LoL machine dont really know much a lot of the time
Or just use smartphone and see their attention-span drop to minimums as they scroll through social media and whatsapp
Lol it's cool to get your kids on board with your hobbies, they may share them with you and it can be a cool experience for them, but to force them to do it to such an extent will probably just make them hate the game and despise you when you force them to play it
Very popular
Until the start of the pandemic there were talks to legalize the selling of weed
For now you can only have them legally via shady smokers clubs and by self cultivation
Id say almost everyone of Young age has smoked sometime in their lives, so very popular
Relatively popular among young people, I smoked a few times, a lot of young people have at least tried it, and I know people who consume regularly
My parents told me they both smoked weed when they were young too
Among older people it's rarer, though
I have a couple of relatives in their 50s I know smoke but that's it
Not my country, but in Germany there’s Jannik (that should be the standard because of the name coming from Jan Niklas) but there are endless versions such as Yannik, Yannick, Janick, etc
I find it so confusing, specially when you get a Jannik -ish client and have to write his name down
This also happens with Lukas/Lucas/Luka/Luca, Markus/Marcus and almost every name that contains a C or a K.
No, because Spanish it's written as it sounds
What we DO have are some "Karens" naming their kids with English names but writting them as Spanish names
Examples:
Ethan = Izan
Ryan = Rayan
Dylan = Dilan
I've seen people legally called Maikel here aswell, theres probably people with mispelled "Jonathan" or "Jenniffer"
There are definitely some name variations
I've seen Ainoa/Ainhoa, Helena/Elena, Elia/Elía just to name a few
I guess that's why Philip II of Macedon was assassinated, he named his son Alex
After reading your edit OP, I think we should create the flair "Please excuse my English" haha
I would say native speakers mix up those words more than non native speakers
Please English my excuse
I went from Spain to Ireland at your age during the peak of the crisis 8 years ago
First thing to bear in mind: there are hundreds like you there, which means you are not special for being an Italian young man looking for new horizons, it won't help you to find a job if you focus on that characteristic
Don't mention your condition unless they ask you explicitely, you better show how being in another country is nothing to be proud/ashamed of, just a normal thing for someone like you
Focus on your true skills and let language aside, most people focus on their multilingual capacity and, as I said, that is far too common in Ireland and UK as these countries are overcrowded by European inmigrants, specially from the South and East
Second advice, take your time to have fun and enjoy the experience
My first year in Ireland was terrible because I was stressed out by not finding a good job, only shitty ones, and feeling bad about expending my salary on beers and trips
Going out in Ireland is super expensive if you compare it to Spain so you have to do it differently, much more house parties and less pubs
My second year I started doing more things and I made more friends and this eventually helped me finding a good job
Good luck
I applaud you for moving to a new country, it's gonna be a great challenging experience
As many other people have said, you'll find what you are running from in many other countries, including Ireland
It's fine to want to go, but  try **to not be bitter about your home country**. Italy has a lot to offer and I hope one day you'll be able to see it
I'm French and I move to London, UK after my studies to be with my SO
I really enjoyed it, I could find a job relatively easily, and I was able to change sector without too much trouble (moving to tech)
The UK is far from perfect, but I found it was easy to fit, in at least in London, the bureaucracy is really easy to handle, and I liked the work culture
The country is beautiful ans has a lot to offer
And being payed in a British pound made visiting other country seemingly really affordable
But it's a place where if you lose your job you're completely fucked, and it's impossible to ever buy a place
Now with Brexit, it's a door that's closed for a lot of young unqualified Europeans
Then a few years later, we moved to Spain, looking for better weather and a more latin lifestyle
We found job easily (having a few more years of experience), and we both agree that our living conditions are much better here
Even though we originally earned less, our purchasing power was higher
Now I work for a remote company and it's even more enjoyable
I feel really lucky, I know Spain has a garbage economy and with Covid it's getting worse
Accommodation is expensive compare to salaries in bigger cities and the bureaucracy is a nightmare
I love the people, the language(s), the food, the Mediterranean weather, the landscapes
If you live in Madrid or Barcelona, it's really easy to integrate as a foreigner
There is no ideal condition, only compromises, and the more you spend time in a place, the more you will lose your rose-tinted glasses
I can't see myself going back to France at the moment
I feel like things are getting worse there, but when I take a step back, I also know that's it's a beautiful rich country with a solid social security system
I moved from Spain to Scotland 5 years ago and my experience so far has been positive
My reasons to move were quite similar to yours, lower salary, higher house prices, high rent, high unemployment
I started on a job for the first 3 years, then moved to a better-paid job for another 2 years and this year started to work independently achieving financial stability that didn´t get in Spain in 10 years since I graduated
I Live in a nice house near the coast, with stunning outdoor walks close to me and people has been nice and welcoming since day 1
I only regret not coming before
Obviously, I miss my family and friends, but Spain is only over 2 hours by flight and pre-covid very affordable trip
As someone mentioned before, enjoy your life
I have encountered numerous immigrants that want to save as much money as possible to come back to their countries or start some project and they live in the cheapest flat, eating beans and potatoes every day and not doing anything fun never ever because can´t spend money
Obviously, they hated the country, the people, their jobs and never realized is not the country they hated, but their lives
I'm currently living in Estonia but I'm planning to come back once I finish my master
Imagine wanting not to be able to do this
/*cries in UK*/
I actually moved to Cork during my second year and eventually came back to Spain
I liked Cork much more than Dublin in every sense
I eventually came back to Spain when the crisis went over
Even though I hope I'll never need to migrate again, I don't regret anything about my years in Ireland and I always encourage young people to do the same
You mean [this] right
It's called vía férrea (iron way/track) or línea ferrea (iron line) or ferrocarril (iron lane) but people usually says "vías del tren" (train's tracks)
And ferrocarril
Even being correct, it's true that people always say only "via" or "via del tren".
Yo estaba to confundio pensando que era algo que solo los yanquis tienen lol
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
"Via del tren" (singular) has way less results
En España también, para referirse al objeto en concreto (por ejemplo, "no te acerques a las vías")
Pero cuando se refiere uno a la red en general se suele usar ferrocarril
I wasn't talking about plural/singular, just about "via ferrea"
The inside of Spain is very empty
There are still signs of civilisation but you could literally spend hours driving into never-ending landscapes and not seeing a single car
There are ghost towns too
Small villages of less than 20 houses all empty
Edit: if you want to live as an hermit there is no way you would be able as said in the comment under mine
As I've said you might be able to live in the Pyrénées with relatively few neighbours or even in a single house in the wilderness
But there's always a road or a nearby village and most of the place is protected (and don't even think about starting a fire)
You can still get lost exploring the mountains
Living like a hermit is practically impossible
Population density may be a factor but not a final one
Spain is more sparsely populated, especially non-coastal areas except Madrid, but you won't find what OP says unless if you count national parks, *maybe*.
It is indeed empty but completely unsuitable to live as a hermit as OP asked
A lot of it is private farms or hunting grounds so you would be trespassing
Ghost towns are out of the question too because people are fiercely protective of their properties even if it is a pile of rubble nobody has lived in for 80 years
And then there's the national parks, some of which do offer more chances to get lost, but since it is forbidden to camp in them except for very specific areas --and unless you find a spot that is far enough from walking trails-- it is quite likely you would be discovered and arrested in a short time
I clearly missed the part of living as an hermit
There is no way it could work
I've seen a few houses in the Pyrénées but that's as close as you can get
You can live as an hermit
There's still some cenobium here and there and I know positively that there are hermits in Mallorca (one of them died recently)
What you can't live as is as a squatter
Amazing character
It's not at all
It's about how population density is distributed, not about the total population density
Russia has places meeting OP's scenario not because of its 8 people/km^2 but because it has huge areas that are uninhabitable or with really harsh conditions
There's a self-sustained little town in the middle of the Sierra de Ayllón, it's called "Fraguas". It occupies a town previously destroyed by Franco forces for use as a training / target practice area
I've visited and it's pretty cool, they've reconstructed some of the houses and built new ones, they have crops and solar panels, and even a beer factory
They are being prosecuted since it's a protected area but it's just an area where autoctonous oak trees were replaced with pine for lumber
They've been replanting oak and don't do much ecological damage
They even have a reinforced house to offer resistance if they try to forcefully evict them
I think it's a pretty cool effort and it's the closest to living as a hermit I could come up with
Yeah you totally can, there is a [webpage] where you can buy entire abandoned villages and stuff
There are some stories going around about some friends and their families buying a ghost town, rebuilding it and living there from the agriculture and livestock
I didn't consider the possibility of having enough money for that, given that OP mentioned bushmen
I mean, buying a full town ain't cheap, even completely abandoned and ruined ones (nobody gives up a property for nothing in this country, even if it is an unsellable toxic dump)
But I guess being loaded and living like a hermit are not incompatible things
I'm completely unable to find the news article in English because these are usually regional news and I only know a few cases within Catalunya (which is already a small sample, and the news are in catalan)
I found two examples:
-A town called Esblada, they almost bought the town but had some problems with the bank the day before buying it
This is what I was refering to, I thought they made it in the end but I was wrong
They had a really ambitious project though
-Another town called Solanell, which is being bought and reconstructed slowly as they have to contact every owner of every house to buy them and reconstruct them
These project had to bring water and electricity there too but it is going fairly well
They have built an inn and they intend to give each house to every person in the cooperative that is buying the town so there won't be any speculation going on
In fact the people in the cooperative seem to already have some connection with the town (the town they where born in etc
[This article] explains it fairly well but I cannot find anything in english
It's in Catalan so you may be able to translate it using google translate
You could probably buy a single dilapidated house for less than 10k. Keep in mind on that price range you would most likely have to tear it down and build a new one, so you would need to add the cost of the construction
Also, it is quite likely you would not have access to modern utilities (water, electricity, internet) so that's even more extra expenses to make it livable
All in all it is probably much easier and cheaper to buy a house or a farm in a very small but still inhabited town
Our previous head of state, King Juan Carlos I, was born in Rome
It depends on the country
But our head of state, our king, has more foreign than Spanish blood, his father's family was French and his mother's Greek
No one would care
P.S: Except the republicans
In Spain the press has been sinking for a while, and the last right-wing government pretty much put the last nail in the coffin, as President Rajoy basically refused to be accountable and answered only the questions he liked (à la Trump)
El País was and still is the most important journal, but its credibility is nowhere near where it was
Nobody expects them to be really critical of politicians or the government because, well, they haven't.
I would say the closest answer to your question would be El Jueves (the Thursday)
Let me elaborate
This is a satirical magazine similar to Charlie Hebdo, published on Wednesdays by the way, were they draw cartoons of politicians and make fun of them
Seems innocent enough, but you can't imagine the shitstorms we get whenever they publish a cover with the royal family on it
They did the crown prince doing her wife doggystyle, both naked; they did the former king passing down a huge turd to his son (at the time of the real life coronation), etc
They may not ever cause the fall down of a politician, but the magazine really shows you how much hidden power the crown still holds and how large is the divide between them and the rest of society,and they got into trouble for it
The editor basically fired most of those working on it and they had to buy the rights and start their own business (as fr as I remember, it was a while ago)
I hope this sufficiently answers the question  if I have the time I'll post another example from TV later, as a reply
Cheers
Let's say that the 2 most important newspapers in spain ABC and El Pais are more comprehensive with the right than with the left
None, TV is fully bought by the leftists (the government even gave them 15 million € 10 days ago), and most newspapers are bought as well
The third paper of record El Mundo is somewhat right-tending though
ABC I think can go either way but is right-ish in the economics portal while El País is somewhat left-tending
^Also ^happy ^cake ^day
We have eldiario
es that is clearly left-wing, they were the ones that discovered the corruption with the master's degrees, etc
that lead to the resignation of Cifuentes
It's just an electronic paper, but it counts
Since when El Pais is a right wing newspaper
Another matter is when PRISA group didn't save PSOE's image back then, but they have never supported the right either
Having said that, nowadays the main left media group in Spain is Mediapro (LaSexta etc
Las entrevistas de Risto Mejide son ejemplos buenísimos de la inclinación de las periodistas y los medios de comunicación en España.
Es una vergüenza el socialismo en España.
Hombre inda que esta todo el dia ahi de izquierdas no es
Sorry but La Sexta belongs to A3Media, not Mediapro
They are not a left channel the same way Mediapro isn't a left media group
Some of the journalist you may know working there, yeah they are very lefties
We don't really have long time alliances but the Irish people and us always supported each other AFAIK
They're the only guys in Europe who didn't have a war with as in countries fighting
Germany, never fought against us alone, has fought on our side a ton of times, and against us only twice as part as a coalition
Which is a lot considering we have fought France, the UK and the Netherlands in more than 15 wars each
Last time we helped Germany it was in WW2, luckily for us we just had finished our civil war so the country was destroyed and we couldn't get in the war with full support, only volunteers went to fight for Germany, 47
000 volunteers to be exact
Some of them to restore their honor (kind of), some for money and some to fight communism
Not Lithuania
> Cant answer for us, because obvious
Not to me
Could you say who it is and why
Probably because they didn't even exist as a country haha
It never was a *soverign* country, that's what I meant
therefore they didn't have a say of who they would go to war with or support them or whatever
Yes, lots
To my despair
Lately the predominant one has the word STAFF
Staff for who
The President
The Mayor
All of us
I will have a beer here, in the subway
Thank you
Yeah, that's the generic guy t-shirt here
Usually with a picture of some random street or landmark
Maybe sometimes also a year, usually 19XX, and probably not the year the picture was taken
Although the broken English is not that common
He means that that's the number written on Roman numbers
Usually light-hearted and meant to make people feel good, but I think it's common to be sarcastic too
The most common jokes are dialogue-based ones that take a paragraph of storytelling to get to the punchline
You see this often in Whatsapp chain messages but also in person
Spanish humour is only politically correct these days
You are supposed to punch up

El pepe
One of the vets of my dogs is from Croatia
He is fluent in Spanish and he's got the darkest sense of humour I have seen in ages
I had a dog who had some kind of tumor in her tail, so this vet had to cut off the tail
My dog slept that night at the clinic, she was old and needed constant care
So next day I go to pick her, it was a Friday
I ask the vet, "Do you think we can have a barbacue at home on Sunday
" meaning would my dog be OK even if the house is fulll of people
He answered, "I am so sorry, but her tail is already in the biological hazardous waste bin".
I really love your input, thank you

Not so bad but a few weeks ago the president of the Community of Madrid freak out in an interview
She has been determined to build a hospital in record time (Madrid can't be less than China) and the interviewer asked her how many health care workers they were going to hire for the new hospital
The president slipped up to say that they were going to take doctors away from hospitals already in operation and bring them to the new hospital instead of hiring new ones
The interviewer, very surprised, asks her if she has understood correctly and they are going to take doctors from the hospitals that are already at the limit of their possibilities because of the Covid, and that is when the president realizes that she has screwed up and everything goes to hell
She takes her hands to her ears as if she wanted to be swallowed by the earth, starts moving nervously, repeat the same things over and over again and concludes proclaiming categorically "you don't ask a president things like that".
The hospital is already open and, yes, they have taken doctors from other hospitals, cost overrun of 46 million euros (97 million instead of 52 million) and on top of that it is unfinished, its basically a [very large industrial building with beds] no privacy for patients and no operating rooms
Here is an illustrative [picture] of the peak moment and, if you are interested in practicing Spanish, [here is the video]
God, that WAS cringe
Poor old man, he just couldn't hear anything :(
There's also Andrea Levy in that videocall at the Asamblea de Madrid
I think she must have been drunk:
why Madrid
why did you do that
Murcia doesn’t exist (:
The "Worldmap" of Bilbao
Miquel Montoro
If you are Spanish you know who this kid is
if you don’t prepare for the best time of your life
Wait I've seen the guy on TV, when he played for Real Madrid
Has he been put down
[Jordi Hurtado] is an immortal being that hasn't changed a bit since the dawn of time
In Catalonia we have the same running joke, but Andorra declares war against Catalonia, we surrender and become independent
I was looking for this:)
Neither does Teruel, it's suspicious that they insist that much on it by making a fucking politic party called Teruel Existe, or Teruel exists
Se vende Ford fiesta del 2009 que folla solo
In Mad Max water was the most valuable resource
In our post-apocalyptic future it will be Scott toilet paper rolls
That guy is a collective illusion
Well, they are in the government now so they may exist
But I don’t see Murcia in the government
"Mapamundi de Bilbao", showing the world as Bilbao's centered surroundings
It's an inside joke about  the alleged basque's tendency for exaggeration
So why the hell did she end up as the president of the European Comission
Maybe he homeschooled them
Here in spain we jokingly say that portuguese women have moustaches,so its not that weird
Una coña que llevo mucho tiempo escuchando en mi insti y en todas partes, lo que decía el otro era algo así como, se vende boiler, que no sé cómo se traduce
I mean you used to have reasonably-qualified people running things before you failed the 2016 election
Explain it to me please
Pues eso
Yes, I do
Mostly Ireland's because I have a personal interest on it, I am going to move there in a few years
Besides Ireland, I get informed a bit on what is happening on big and influential countries (US, France, etc
I also keep an eye on EU news
Not always, only when there is something to pay attention
For example, never put an eye on Azerbaijan until the last months
Yes
And actually the CDU event has been one of the major political news of the day here
Honestly, not really
I only follow US politics a bit when there's elections, and I used to follow UK politics during Brexit
I think we have enough shit on our plate, yet I put even more
When I had decided that I was not going to stay in Spain -  mainly due to the laboral market situation - I started to think what country I would like to live in when I finish my career
I got informed about a lot of countries (France, Netherlands, UK
) and I really liked Ireland
As much as one can learn of a country and its people from the outside, I loved it
A great plus is that I already speak the language
So that makes it easier to - apart from moving to the country without needing to learn a new language - to interact with Irish people through Internet (for example through Ireland's subreddit) and therefore being able to experience some degree of *Irishness* even before I move there
Also, I think that - even within our differences - we Spaniards and Irish are somewhat similar
There are all kinds of Irish and Spanish people, of course, but we both are known internationally for being very friendly people and for knowing how to have a great deal of craic
My impression has been overall great
The thing that I am most *upset* - to say it boldly - about is how the housing crisis is being dealed with
I do not know if I have the right or am sufficiently informed to give my opinion about it as someone who has not experienced it in first person, but I think that more can be done to improve the situation
Either Cork or Limerick, probably
I not that much into politics as to have an opinion made of the different political parties
I started to keep an eye on Irish news 6 months ago
I only know the party who's been in power since the last year's election
And I think they are doing well
To be honest, I am not a politics person
I am not even much into Spanish politics neither
I know the basics of every political party to be able to understand what's happening and that's all
Murcia
You never know what sort of crazy things they're up to down there, and there's no witnesses to tell it
On a more serious note, in any run down district of any big city there are sketchy parts
You've got some "poblados" (settlements) that are close to be slums where there is a heavy drug trafficking problem
Then there are parts of Spain completely empty where villages and towns, although they appear on the map, they've been abandoned for decades and there's no one left except for some old people
Some people with issues live isolated and can be scary if encountered alone
Like, conspiranoid survival prepper stalker kind, I've met a couple and they are the type of people that would shoot a couple of campers
Belchite, it's a village where in the Spanish Civil War, got destroyed, about 5000 died in the village, today it was rebuilt but some metres away there is still the old destroyed village
Iker Jiménez says hello
They are polite people with a great sense of humour
Add to the mix that joking about stereotypes has always been trendy, no matter how accurate they are
We all love Murcia, those are just our running gags
I understand the Murcianos who are fed up, though
very popular
most kids in rural and suburban areas drink by the age of 15
Unfortunately common and becoming a serious problem
I wonder how many more 14 year-olds in a comma we need to collectively wake up
About the same thing that you said
Most people start at around 16 in my experience, getting their drinks from the guy that looks the oldest in the group
I wonder, how popular are “botellones” these days
Are they still a thing, or have police curbed them
63 different parties received votes during the 2019 general elections
Of which 16 managed to get representatives in the Congreso de los diputados
Most are regionalist parties, others are historical parties that no longer have that much power
The rest is probably parties with a very specific interest like maybe PACMA which fights for animal rights, so this kind of parties don't usually get representation because bigger parties already have policies regarding those topics
Here we have 5 important national parties and a lot of more local parties
the "main" parties went from 2 in the 2000's to 5 in the 2010's
i think thats a good thing, more alternatives and more parties to represent people's ideas
but on the other hand our voting system benefits the bigger parties, and punishes the small ones, specially if they are spread out throughout the country
So theres a tendency to do "useful vote" and vote for the big party instead of the one that actually aligns with you
Adding to this, the main parties (from right to left Vox, PP, PSOE and Podemos; "far" right, right, left "far" left respectively) shit a lot on each other but they act very similarly and it doesn't feel like there's a choice, specially for the left
Demonstrated corruption in the main 2 parties (PSOE and PP) doesn't really help with the apathy voters feel
Edit: now that I remember, there has also been a bunch of proven corruption cases in Vox, the worst one was about a marxist party in Iran helping fund their campaign in the Andalusian local elections (because fuck ideals, the far left funding foreign reactionaries)
Podemos has now an ongoing investigation, but since this is not the first time they're accused of something and all cases have been dropped because there was 0 evidence, it's safe to say that the accusers pulled it out of their ass
We'll see if it's true
I think it's very funny that Cs didn't even make it on that list
Which is obvious
But still funny
Albert deserved it
You can't just create a """centrist""" party exclusively to shit on Catalonia and expect the voters to not realize
"""Socialdemocrats""", lol
Liberals are annoying
Vox is exactly like the Republican party on social issues (minimal gun control, Christian values, anti-immigration rhethoric), but economically I feel like they're slightly corporatist (fascist) instead of capitalist
The Popular Party (PP) is socially conservative, but not as much as the Republican party, and they're also capitalists
I'd say they're slightly further right than the Democrats
They're the main right-wing party
The Socialist Party or Spanish Socialist Worker's Party (PSOE) is economically slightly leftist, but still capitalist
They're somewhere in between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but they swing around right and left
They're the historical left-wing party and they used to be marxist until right after they won their first election in the 80s. It would have been very awkward to have Central Europe surrounded by socialist republics lol
They're also socially progressive, like the democrats
Podemos used to be anti-capitalist a few years ago, now it's what would happen if Bernie Sanders founded a party but was a coward and didn't actually get anything done
They're as socially progressive as the Socialist Party, and their ideology is generally "extremist" socialdemocracy and eurocommunism (which practically functions like socialdemocracy)
Their talking points are tangently marxist, but their policies are only marginally more left-wing than those of the Socialist Party
Right now the government is composed of a Socialist Party president and 2 vice presidents, and a vice president from Podemos
Most of the ministers are from the Socialist Party except for 2 or 3 from the Communist Party, which isn't actually communist and it's also in Podemos
I would say that the Republicans have an obvious equivalent here, Vox, but the Democrats are harder to "translate". I guess they'd be considered centrists, between the PP and the PSOE
They are economically very close to the PP but socially they'd share most opinions with the Socialist Party
I live in an area of Madrid with pretty much exclusively small hole in the wall restaurants and bars owned by immigrants
Lately I have been eating out, or getting take away a lot more- nearly every day of the week, partially because I’ve been extremely busy but also because I know a lot of these places are suffering these days
The people over at r/personalfinance would probably chew me out for eating out so much, but I am happy to support the little holes in the wall that are going through tough times
I’ve quickly become on personal terms with the staff at 4-5 places near my house, and I tip as often as I can
I travel a lot (not so much lately), and one waitress, when asking me about a recent trip, asked me if I could bring her a fridge magnet the next time I go somewhere- so now it’s become a regular thing and I’ve brought her 4 or 5 fridge magnets from all around Europe
Warms my heart to interact on a personal level with local businesses
I'm still a member of the mountain and climbing club of my hometown even though nowadays I mostly go on my own means and material and less often
I've never suspended my membership to my scout's group even when I couldn't attend
Same goes to my town's musical society, I will always pay membership even if I'm not currently playing in the band
I always pay the union monthly fee
My union does not receive funding from the state and mutual aid between workers is essential
They saved my skin, I'll save anyone's.

Hello, Spanish Ornitological Society donor here
What you are doing is very cute
Madrileño(a) ;) .. in my neighborhood, a lot of South Americans- mainly Colombians, Peruvians, and Ecuadorians
But all around the city you’ll find people from most parts of the world
There are neighborhoods with high Chinese populations, in fact they own most of the small convenience stores here, to the point where the colloquial term for that type of store is a ‘Chino’ (not here to debate the rights and wrongs of that), there areas with lots of Indians, various African nationalities
depending on where you are, Madrid can be quite multi cultural
Depending on how blunt you want to put it:
Venga vale
Bueeeeno
(Ya) Está bien
¡Suficiente
¡Hasta aquí (hemos llegado)
It would be "Buen punto" which literally translates to Good point, but it's mostly used as fair enough
I feel like those examples are kind of passive-aggressive
"Fair enough" is like "yeah i guess you have a point". *Venga vale* and *Está bien* are the most accurate, but the others are a bit mad and exasperated
The tone does most of it though, you're right on that
The expression I would most likely use would be *También es verdad*, which translates to "(i guess) that's right".
I'm going with "no te falta razón" (You don't lack a point)
I joke with a friend of mine that it's *justo justo*
There's indeed no literal translation because that would be "suficientemente justo" and nobody says that
But there's definitely ways to express that feeling of "okay okay let's go on" or "yeah okay I don't agree but okay".
Vale would work too, but I feel like it's a pretty neutral word, and it's mostly the tone that you use that can paint it differently
That's why I wanted to give more examples
That's the thing about language though
Every language can express everything
Just not necessarily as easily or with the same tools
Si tiramos de dichos (sayings), me quedo con: Para ti la perra gorda
Man, I use también es verdad constantly
Yeah, it's hard to come up with the expressions we use all the time right
Kinda weird
Probably when one person is trying to convince you about something and you just tell him "okay, whatever, you won, I dont want to argue more".
2 names max (unless you are from the monarchy) and 2 family names the first family name if your father and the first family name of your mother (or viceversa)
Women do not change their family names when they marry
&#x200B;
If you do not have the spanish nationality you are allowed to give your baby all the names your country allows (but if that baby later get the spanish nationality he would lose all the extra names)
Spanish names:
First name + A middle name if you get one + Father's surname + Mother's surname
The women get to keep their surnames, AND recently it became legal to have the mother's name as the first surname
In Spain, people have a first name, an optional middle name and two last names
The first last name is the father's, and the second is the mother's. Middle names often come before the first name, it really just depends on which you get called, which one is shorter or more recognisable
For example, my dad's name is Joaquín Silverio
Everyone calls him Silverio (or Silver, for short), and that's probably because both his dad and grandad were also named Joaquín. It was just easier to know who they're talking about if they called him Silverio
There are also a ton of two-word names
If someone's name is José Antonio, you can't really call them José nor Antonio (even if those two are names separately)
It's just José Antonio
Both goes for José María (male name) and María José (female name
Two incredibly common two-word names over here
You can basically put José, María or "del Carmen" around any name and it probably exists lol
As a fun fact, my name is Alba, vanilla Alba, and I know a girl named Alba María del Carmen
It's just how it goes
* One or two first names
* First surname (inherited from the first surname of the father)
* Second surname (inherited from the first surname of the mother)
Nothing to do with the monarchy the thing with the string of names
They have the ordinary one or two given names, as they should appear on the civil registry
The string of names are baptismal names, only appearing on church records
My mom have 3 names and they re shown in all their official documents
The thing is that she hates her first name and she has tried to remover it several times and has not been allowed to do it
Technically we have a list of surnames dating back to the invention of surnames since your first surname is the first surname of your dad, the second is the first of your mum, your third is the second of your dad, the fourth is the second of your mum and so on
I was born in Belgium and I got the 2 surnames of my dad xd, had to change it some years ago so I had my moms
That's really interesting
So the father's name is put after Mariya, in a female form
So if Mariya was a guy, it'd be "Mariya Petro Moroz"? There's probably a suffix for males, would it maybe be " Mariya Petrovich Moroz"? I'm really only guessing
and Picasso full name was  "Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso"
But law was changed (early 80s if I remember correctly) and you can't do that anymore
Is not a middle name exactly, but a composed name: Jose Antonio, my name, is composed by the names Jose and Antonio
The problem is that there are many situations in which a form is not filled out, but the ID card is used or it is mandatory that the data you provide matches the data on the card
For example, when we go to the hospital we use a card, she once missed her turn to visit a specialist because when they called her in the waiting room they used her first name, and she didn't realize they were calling her
She has tried to change it, but the civil registry will not allow her to do so because it is considered to be an insignificant change that can harm others
Bureaucracy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Would love to adopt that system
Blew my mind more than it should've lol, thanks for explaining
Legal Name: Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso
Baptismal name:Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Crispiniano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso
Here is the baptismal certificate at least a photo
I have not found the other one, but this is an "official" source
I would have died about 17 times so far
Married to a Navy soldier/officer (depending on my skill) and tending to the kids and the farm
It's basically what every woman in my family did until 1950
Either tiling the fields or killing/dying in the very bloody south American independence war in the name of the worst king Spain ever had
Probs just a fisherman in the Mediterranean with some downlived aspirations of becoming a pirate with my own Buckaneer
Assuming I've survived the Henoch–Schönlein purpura in my childhood (which would were recently described, in 1802), due to my family name ("de Vega") and for as long as I know, I would had lived in Madrid
Which due to my age, I probably would had participated in the Dos de Mayo uprising in 1808 (with no doubt) and eventually would participated in Peninsular War (or Guerra de Independencia Española)
Assuming I had survived both Dos de Mayo uprising and Peninsular War, and due my family history, I'd probably try to live as a painter reflecting scenes from war
Due to the restoration of absolutism in 1814, the feeling of the upcoming hispanoamerican independence uprisings, and unknowing the upcoming restoration of Spanish Constitution of 1812 in 1820, I would probably tried to move to Puerto Rico or Cuba
Caribbean sea always called my attention
Probably a priest or farmer who died fighting in the independence war
I would have died at birth (they had to do an emergency c section to save me)
If somehow I'd survive that, I would have died for sure at 8 months old when I had pneumonia
In my case, I would have been dead by the age of 3
A nasty case of a flu
How come
Don't want to ruin your day, but surviving seven childbirths
That sounds unlikely
I get sick all the time
I am literally typing this while waiting for my turn at the clinic
Yeah, he didn't earned the nickname "the criminal" for nothing
Lol
Get well, fellow stranger
Don't forget famine and epidemics were widespread during that time due to bad harvests and the Napoleonic wars so I'm afraid you'd be very dead
Thank you
Liberal democracies should back each other, especially when their freedom it's under threat by an undemocratic and powerful regime
Having lived in Taiwan, I can only but support their fight to have the right to be out of the shadow of China
Absolutely
I think the EU as a whole should recognize the ROC
That Taiwan is not China we all know that, we're just afraid of the response from the PRC, which is a stupid reasoning not to support a legitimate demcratic State
Taiwan has a legitimate democracy and other western democracies should indeed be siding with them instead of with PRC (by siding, I mean recognizing its independence and making the international relations that already exist with the country be official, not siding with Taiwan on the pretension that the whole continental China belongs to the government of the POC lol)
Well as Taiwan is actually democratic why i wouldnt support it, that kind of agrements benefitiate both so no problems
Yes
I hope the EU and its member state would stand against China and in favor of Taiwan self determination
There was this hope that as China get richer it would embrace democracy, but it's clearly not happening, and it's now a modern imperial power with aggressive regional ambition
We should stand with Taiwan, and support other liberal democracies
Those saying they fear offending Chine realize the more you give to China, the more power they have over you
Import substitution is a joke of a policy, look at Argentina if you want to know where that gets you
We should try to stop Chinese IP theft and currency manipulation, but ignoring comparative advantage and going backwards from a service, information and highly specialised manufacturing economy towards one of low skill mass production is a moronic populist move that would just cause poverty
I agree
Taiwan's stance on One-China policy is very complex, really
Whereas Mainland is pretty clear on the issue, Taiwan isn't so much, and every political party has its own view
All of my Taiwanese friends (they are all in the age between 20-25) have told me they don't believe in One-China, the don't even approve being called Chinese and prefer to be called Taiwanese, and they think international recognition won't ever come from holding such a policy
On the other hand, China won't negotiate unless all parties come into the debate agreeing that unification of some sort is the way to go
So yeah, the majority of Taiwan would need to unite in holding one view in orther for the western countries in the EU and America to even think about Taiwan's recognition
And that view has to be precisely that of seeking out recognition, which probably will come sooner or later (as it's the trend amongst youger voters)
Maybe they need to keep their political independence and form a some kind of Asian Union where Taiwan and PRC can co-exist with freedom of movement for their citizens
That would definitely be the ideal outcome
Edit: i just don't know whether Taiwan or China would be down for it
Definitely seems more like an option China would like rather than Taiwan's favorite
It's similar to the Hong Kong case

Well, they think the same about Spain

The Spanish army built a submarine that cannot float
100% quality
Don’t get me wrong, if the requirements were something to be down the sea, they nailed it but I don’t know if that is really functional if there are going to be soldiers inside :)
My uni still has some computers with XP
Technically, it floated, but once submerged, there was no certainty it would float back
From 440M per boat to 550M after being realistic, and then 1000M per boat
Great:
Also don’t forget the time when FNMT (the entity that prints money on Spain) tried to have their SSL certificates accepted by Firefox
It took them nearly a decade
r/DataHoarder added an extra zero
Wait, floppy disks
My uni still has XP running older emulations of windows
Mine has a humongous windows 10 gaming laptop (the best at the time) hooked to the bloody radiology machines
Windows 7 is quality
Windows XP is almost the same on functionality, but has an interface that makes everything so much difficult
I forts read it the other way and thought that helicopters not shooting at tanks not flying was OK
Reality hit me a bit late

The word "sobremesa". It is when you have already finished your meal but you are still sitting at the table talking with your companions
It is common to do that in Spain, so a perfect translation in English will come handy if it were
Does “trivial” fit into that same meaning
In spanish there's the word 'modorra' for that
I think it might be used in other similar contexts but mainly for that
>it's funny that in Spain you hang out with friends after eating, in Germany we just have dessert
The sobremesa is after the dessert, it's just staying at the table talking when you are finished eating (it's not going to another place)
>Be the change you want to see
Just don't follow me
None in particular but I honestly hate what regional governments of our eastern mediterranean regions have allowed in their coasts
You have entire sections of the mediterranean from barcelona downwards looking like this (  )
Just blocks and blocks of ugly samey looking houses
They just rode the wave of tourism and made it bigger with cheap architecture, making so many beautiful cities uglier
It's worse in the big cities' suburbs IMO
If I remember that building correctly, it's not ugly per se, it's just totally out of place in the Parisian landscape
I wouldn't call it ugly, rather Cyberpunk-y
After seein the monster citties that surround our bigger towns i'd say they are as ugly
Tbh not all the mediterranean is like that
The balearic islands are a paradise (if you ever want to go)
And also the northern coast is nothing like that and the andalucian coast has managed it way better
Yes, sadly
At least it's optional, but, at least during primary (primaria) we have the option to chose either religion or well anything else
I remember asking my teacher, when I was 8 yo, "If god created the earth, who created the rest of the planets"
She had no answer lol
We got that same scam in Spain as well through Francisco Franco
Apart from what you explained related to education, the catholic institutions don't pay taxes at all (even if they are a private university or other business making profit) and they can register any property under their name, stealing hundreds of historic buildings
tell him that in germany you cant say you dont like germany because there is no free speech
Link to the snickers story
We apparently stare as well
Barcelona: second most populated city, great industrial and tech hub, history deeply related to Spain's struggles, and it would ruffle the feathers of both Spanish and Catalan nationalists, which is always a plus
I don't think I'd move it
Madrid is the closest one to the center of the country and all the highways are already designed that way
Oviedo was once the capital city of a little kingdom that ended conquering first the Iberian Peninsula and then half of the world
It would be a good option
Barcelona would not be an option for most Spaniards due to political and historical reasons
It would make way more sense Sevilla, Valladolid, León, Santiago de Compostela, Zaragoza or even Valencia if you were going for something different to the obvious alternative to Madrid that is Toledo
>and it would ruffle the feathers of both Spanish and Catalan nationalists, which is always a plus
You have my support
The capital of Spain should switch every certain years
The country is so diverse and centrifugal, that every region should take the lead and responsibility from time to time, stopping the foolish and poisonous Capital versus Provinces dynamic
Toledo would definitely be better than Barcelona
Barcelona is a bad option due to geography
Capitals work better when they are in the center of the country, making everything more connected
Not toledo :( its too beautiful to move big offices and banks there
In the center like Brasilia, Madrid, Riga, Minsk, Brussels, Ciudad de México, Santiago de Chile, Bogotá, San José, Dodoma, Abuya, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kiev, Tirana, Ankara, Bagdad, Adis Abeba, Norsultan (Astana)
Yeah, because it's quite convininent for the country as a whole that the capital is located in the center
Specially in the past, when traveling was not as easy as today
I still think Strasbourg should be the capital, as it was originally planned
It already holds a good chunk of the EU's institutions (including the European Parliament), it has the whole symbolism about Franco-German relations, and it's way more pretty than Brussels
It's the historical reason why some countries have their capital in the center
We are the least or one of the least important countries
Weak economy, high unemployment, tourism dependant, people only comes here to get drunk and sunburnt for cheap, we are the trashcan of Europe
And when we need help, European tax havens complain
I'd say a great place for tourism (@Germany, UK), inversions and retirement, as well as food and overall gastronomy, culture (ole mi flamenco), and also a great place for food (mainly fruits and vegetables) and labourer exportation
We are also a decent economy and a potential place for maritime trade
&#x200B;
p.s it'd be a great plot twist if this was made as an exam on whether we should be expeled from the EU
To be honest I'm hoping for the greek philosophy to make a comeback
Man it'd be awesome
What we definitely do not need is entitled politicians
We still got our fair share even after the UK left
Hey, we appreciate you by how you are, not by who you are
You're alone at imperialistic politics in europe too
I searched it a few days ago, only about 20% of your population wanted to join the EU
May I ask what do you think that's the main reason of this
I feel like this is the best possible answer to this question
Without the EU none of these countries would have enough power to affect world politics and economics at the level we do now
I see people complaining about their country being a big contributor to the EU, but most of them are from small countries that wouldn't stand a chance against bigger nations if it wasn't for the EU
Unity is strength
We’re also a huge food and wine producer
Don’t underestimate the value in that respect
And while a large part of the economy is tourism based, hopefully the pandemic will start to shift that into more sustainable industries
Personally, I’d like to see a big push into renewable energy for export - not just energy production but factories building equipment for renewable energy production
Like Spain, we're so similar, the peninsular brothers
Yeah and india have a bigger economy than the UK and that doesnt mean anything
For a 50M population country we're as relevant as a 10M country
Really
With 20-25% of unemployment, seasonal and low quality jobs related to tourism and now with the covid that caused a lack of tourism and businesses closing en masse we are the 4th strongest economy
Yeah, we export more then the 50% of our food production and farmers can't cover the expenses most of the times, climate change will make water a valuable resource so we (and Europe) will be fucked when that starts to fail too
And some years ago Malaga had the biggest production of solar panels, and almost all industries closed because it was not sustainable because China produced more and cheaper
It's "rebirthing" now, but idk, China beat us once it will probably do it twice
Money causes the long term memory to not work
So it's impossible to learn from our failures (or at least for the people in charge)
It's a aytonomous territory from the Kingdom of Denmark
Do you think it's unlikely for y'all to join us in the future
It’s also disappointing that desalination plants are not a bigger thing here
Yeah, desalination plants are like batteries and grafene, they are always announcing great advances and applications but they never materialize
Some years ago I saw a documentary about a process for desalination plants that cut the costs of producing water greatly (like a 80% or 90%) yet it seems nobody thought about actually doing it
Droughts are common in Spain and every year are longer, idk what are we waiting for to invest I+D+I for desalination plants (probably when we empty the natural aquifers and is too late)
I think some of the population would be against it if they actually tried to use it
Look at the Canary Islands, everybody hates tap water there, even though it's what makes the islands able to sustain their population and produce food
It won't happen until the droughts become too bad to reject it
The only downside I see are waiting times (when it comes to surgeries)
You can be waiting for weeks or months if it is something that can wait
But it is just because they usually give priority to severe diseases
If it is something severe, for example appendicitis, they get you to surgery at the moment
So that's fine by me
My sister had cancer (osteosarcoma with metastasis in the lungs), and they treated her (surgeries and chemotherapy) immediately when they knew what she had
When it comes to appointments with your assigned doctor (we call it "médico de familia; family's doctor), you do not have to wait much, a day or a couple; a week at maximum, from my experience
But if it is something that cannot wait (or you just simply want it seen immediately), you can go to Emergencies and they'll treat you there (a lot of people do that)
The only thing that can happen if you go to Emergencies for something that is not an emergency is that they will tell you "Do you know that this is not an emergency, right
Next time get an appointment, now sit there and wait to your turn".
Slightly higher taxes, and, overall longer waiting queues
I'd rather that 1000000 times over having to sell my house to pay the bills though
I've lived in two countries with free healthcare but different culture/ level of service
To me, one of the downsides can be that people take it for "granted" and will go to the doctor for absolutely everything: colds, flu,  throat hurts, because it's been too long without a blood test and want to check everything is OK
don't get me wrong I wouldn't change free healthcare for anything and things can get picked up faster and easily if everybody goes to the doctor soon but it's not going to be sustainable long term if people keeps behaving like this
There's a level of entitlement of "doctors have to do better"; they just don't realise how lucky they are - many people don't even know you need to pay for healthcare in other countries
I've got a friend that is a doctor and she has avoided her sister taking her nephew to the doctor at least 15 times for very minor completely normal illnesses
Is not really free, I mean
I can go to the hospital or my PG and I will not receive a bill to pay, but it's paid by everyone through taxes, like education, roads, etc
That's what taxes are for
In Spain
Long waiting times to a doctor that seems not to care about you and seems to want to get you out of his office as fast as possible
It's not uncommon to wait a month for a doctor which will tell you to do a test in a month, a month afterwards you'll discuss the results and repeat
I went both through public and private healthcare, and what took the public sector approximately 5 months to do, the private doctor needed a day and 80 bucks
Granted, it wasn't urgent, but still
Depends on the healthcare system tbh
I feel like having some sort of public healthcare is always beter than not, but there's downsides to this
Public administrations are notably inefficient, that's why some countries have alternative systems, like private, non for profit hospitals with public insurance, or "guaranteed insurance" (i.e. you have to get your own insurance but if you can't, the government will fund it)
Waiting times can be long for some things, which sucks, but they try to prioritize important things
Another big advantage of having a public system is that private insurance has to compete with this public system, so they have to keep prices reasonable
All have some upsides and downsides, but I don't really see the upside of purely private healthcare systems
Honestly I struggled to see any
Yes you pay for it in taxes, but in exchange you and everyone you know (who lives here) has access to healthcare for free at the point of use
In Spain you may have to wait, but you can have a really affordable private insurance (like 50 euros/month) and get access to private healthcare network as well
Could people cut the "iT's NoT fReE iT's TaX pAyEd" bullshit
Do you even say "iT's NoT fReE iT's  pAyEd By ThE oWnEr WhO tAkEs MoNeY fRoM cUsToMeRs" when you are given free stuff
>But if it is something that cannot wait (or you just simply want it seen immediately), you can go to Emergencies and they'll treat you there (a lot of people do that)
That's the reason they are always full because people go for some shit that isn't an emergency
I think it's also important to point out that, besides the public healthcare system, there are private hospitals and clinics too, in case someone is in a hurry for something non urgent, or if they prefer to have a fancier hospital room
This private healthcare network is of course cheaper than in other countries where they don't compete with a public network
You couldn't be more clueless
Until you actually got sick and have to pay 300k for 3 nights in the hospital
Waiting for non severe issues does not make sense in a private system - ideally you'd be able to have a system that can treat a guy with a bullet in his stomach AND remove your tonsils at the same time
Public systems are slower as the cost of going to the doctor does not directly impact those that do go to the doctor - turns out people just visit the doctor more often if they don't have to pay
Private systems are self regulating in the sense that both people try not to go to the doctor if they feel they don't have to - and as the system gets strained by capacity it expands (as it is then making more money and realizes it would be able to make even more if it expanded)
Personally I'm fine with having mixed systems - a public one for those that need it and can't afford a private one, and private healthcare for those willing to pay more so they don't have to wait
It's like that in most EU countries afaik
I know this isn't universal, but where I live we have a local clinic (centro de salud) for a population of 30k even though there's supposed to be a clinic per 10k people
The autonomous government won't build another one even though the city council has been demmanding one for like 10 years
The regular services of the clinic are completely saturated all the time and if you want an appointment for your general practitioner (médico de familia) you have to wait over a week
If you have something like a bronchitis or a pharingitis you could be cured by that time if you had received treatment, but if you haven't it might get worse
So for things like that everyone in town goes to the emergency services in the same clinic, which funnily enough are never saturated
The doctors know this and accept it because otherwise they wouldn't be able to treat everyone properly
This wasn't always like that, tho
For example when I was a child I could get an appointment for the next day
I went to the practitioner once with a stomach ache thinking it would be gastroenteritis and it turned out to be apendicitis, but it was fine because I only waited a day
I couldn't do that today
I pay like 40 euros/month for private health insurance
I assume an american one is exponentially more expensive and cover way less
Yeah, you are right in that
> was very lucky to be treated immediately
Well, she was treated immediately when they knew what was going on with her
The tumor had a lot of time to develop unnoticed
They had to cut off her arm (the tumor was near the shoulder) and even then they did not know if she was gonna make it
Fortunately, they got her into an experimental treatment and she recovered eventually
She's alright now
> horrified about the low quality of Spanish Healthcare
> clearly sick people waiting for hours without help and oxygen masks in the wait room
I've never seen that in any of the hospitals I've been
The same thing happens in Spain with the PP
They never say it but when they get to power in autonomous regions (since healthcare is decentralised) they start cutting down fund
Once the healthcare services are in shambles they start saying that it's because public healthcare is inefficient, so they start introducing copayments, semi-privatising clinics and hospitals and promoting private healthcare
>it turned out to be apendicitis, but it was fine because I only waited a day
I couldn't do that today
My sister had appendicitis, she waitwd a few hours until going to emergencies, the doctors spent too much time diagnosing her because she had strong gasses along with it and the diagnosis was being meddled, and it almost got mortal, but they manage to operate her in time
I know that it's case by case, but it surprises me that you were able to wait a day, when my sister, had she waited until 19:00 instead of going to the doctor at 17:00, she would've died
> someone comes first no matter what
Only if you don't have a healthcare system with enough capacity - which will always be the case for public systems (the sole fact that you add capacity makes people use healthcare services more often)
In Spain we buy eggs unrefrigerated and then we put them into the fridge at home cause so haha
Some hospitals in Spain have the color code system
Hungarian, no doubt
Have you seen the length of the words
Euskera
From vasque country in spain
No one knows  where that thing comes from, and it's the most difficult thing ever
English
It always bothers me how word pronunciations are more dependent on the word itself than in its letters
The Spanish civil war, the preamble of the WWII, it is very interesting
The Cromwell regime
It's something I know almost nothing about
the idea of the English being in a republic fascinates me
Why is it shameful that I don't know about it
I lived a whole year in Ireland and they have
"pretty strong" views about Cromwell
For a similar reason I'll one day get into the troubles
I'm building up the courage
Don't worry in Spain they don't teach us about the civil war neither
France between Charlemagne and Joan of Arc, and again between the Battle of Pavia and Louis XIV
Just that they were bogged by internal conflicts preventing them from dominating the continent with their population that dwarfed every other country at the time
Also/particularly, what was the deal with the Cathars and later the Huguenots
Sweden's invasion of Poland is another
Well, almost anything Scandinavia, really
The Spanish Civil War, in a few lazy words:
Population votes, Republic wins
We kick the monarchy out of our country
We enjoy a few years of Republic
The military goes "nope, me no likey". They declare a military coup d'etat
The war starts
More than 500,000 people die, many of them were civilians
The Republicans surrender after almost 3 years of hunger, misery and fear
Franco becomes a dictator for 34 f*cking years and imposes monarchy back in our country after his death in 1975
The french politics in the interwar period
Generally the hystory of the balcan zone specially in the midle ages
The history of north europe pre northern war (excluding the 30 years war and how sweden was involve in it)
how was the crisis that lead to the fall of the byzantine empire
&#x200B;
And probably i will say more
I don't have a clue about the Yugoslav Wars, and I even don't know why, because I was quite aware of what was happening in the Gulf War, which was immediately before
Sadly, really is
The 30 years war is pretty interesting but im ashame that i only have some spanish information and almost nothing in english to pass you
The thing is the Spanish civil war was a prelude to the WWII and ended just before the other started so it got quickly forgotten
It goes from 1936 to 1939 and it was the Republican side who were the rightful Spanish government against the insurgents, the so-called National side who were fascists
The Republicans got help from Russia and  communist and socialist volunteers from other countries such as the  USA (the Abraham Lincoln batallion) whereas the Nationals got help from the Nazi Germany
It's very famous the Guernica painting which depicts the bombing of Guernica by the Nazi Condor Legion and it was one of the first aerial bombings, the Nazis used Spain as a testing area
After the war Spain got so devastated that we couldn't participate in WWII (we would have been Nazi allies after Franco's victory) and therefore we didn't partake of the Marshall Plan getting us behind most European countries
Franco's dictatorship lasted until his death in 1975
Yes and when people thing abaut the great war they only have the image of the western front of the Somme, never from the batles of Isonzo the balkan front or the eastern fron wich are in my opinion even more interesting
well not the best source
its like leraning medicine watching a film abaut a doctor
I mean
you're forgiven
The 30 years war was absolute chaos
There's a point when you don't even know which mercenaries are which
It's in the curriculum
yeah this is how a bad teacher will explain this, totally sided for that conflict
The republicans who fought against the fascist in Spain get exiled to France where they joined to fight against Hitler troops and participate actively to liberate Paris, they were the first to enter there and liberate it (this division is called "La novena/La nueve" "The ninth") and this is sad because once the axis lost the war in Europe, this republicans guys hope to end the fascism at all invading Spain with the allies but it never occurred and they live outside Spain all his lives, almost till the death of Franco (1975), it is sad because in France they remember this heroes but in Spain not because the fascist regime basically  wipe out their memories
Spanish civil war is, in my opinion, the saddest thing happened in Spain because today you can hear the echoes and rivalries of the war, it is normal that people, politically talking, argue using the civil war in his arguments
This is a little pill of Spanish and Europe's history, if you are interested you can search about La Novena, very interesting history
Yeah of course, all the important battles and the repercussion in a neutral point of view
also how the nationalist band pass from just wanting to have a republic orientated to the righ wing and ended supporting a dictatorship,
Wich is something most people dont know
there is a film abaut that called "Mientras dure la Guerra" from the perspective of the spanish writer Miguel de Unamuno
Paul Preston is a British historian specialised in the Spanish Civil war, he is regarded as one of the main academic authorities on it, in case you are interested
2 things to mention
The italians where the ones that give even more support than the germans specially in the ground forces the l3/33 was the secon tank more common in the conflict
Second the nationalist wherent fascist at the begining but after the events of the alcazar de Toledo Franco assumes control of the Nationalist side and then yes then they are fascist
It's shameful that I don't know about it
also you have mercenary companies changing sides constantly
i remember a case in wich they promise a mercenary to pay him to change sides only to get time for the coming troops
i would expect that it been related to the 80 years war you will have a better knowledge abaut it
I know i already explained in another reply how its part of the curriculum but how mostly you never reach it, but maybe its just my experience and of those people ive asked
It's just conviniently left to the end of history semester and at least in my experience (and all the people I've asked) you never really get to see it
Usually there's enough time to reach the s. XIX century and that's it, it's really unusual to get to 1936 in class, and if the teacher  somehow manages he is going to be short on time and won't be able to propearly teach it
yes, there are still fight abaut that so most teacher dont teach you abaut it or teach you from the perspective this side good and this side bad
Would you please give us the other side view
All my family was pro-Nationalists yet they are still unable to formulate a decent argument in favor of their position beyond "Republicans were bad people".
yes but as all the sequels is worse than the original
True to both, forgot about the Italians :)
>yes then they are fascist
Fascistoid\*. Franco wasn't an ideologist like JA Primo de Rivera (who also wasn't exactly fascist, but created falangism inspired by fascism) and his mentor Millán Astray, but he found very convenient to steal and distort PdR's image to justify and glorify his personal cult
the thing is that with the policy of giving weapond to the population the anarchist and communist take advantage and start the revolution
in a very sketchy way
yeah when i was doing a work abaut ir you realise that you also have nations lik
greece,portugal,luxemburg, albania,montenegro, greece,japan ...........
> its part of the curriculum but how mostly you never reach it
Exactly my experience
I wanted to kill my history teacher
Same experience
The CV was glossed over because by the time you get to it there are barely any days left in the school year
However, a teacher of mine told me that it can sometimes kind of be done on purpose because people still feel strongly about it and if students went back home and told their parents what they are being taught at school, parents might not be happy about it
In my school there were some grandchildren of people who were involved with the regime to different degrees, or who simply supported it, so the school definitely didn't want to upset them and lose their students/clients
A pronatiolist will mention the asturias rebelion and the thing called red terror to criminalice the other side, specially the argument abaut the "El terror Rojo" in the asturias rebelion to criminalice the other side, also will talk abaut they where supported by Stalin and talk abaut the popular front as almost a pupet of the ussr like if spain has the same status as countries like poland has in the warsaw pact
A objective person will start talking abaut the carlist wars so you have some background
will talk abaut the conflicts of the left and righ then they will proceed to explain how a movement that started wanting a righ wing repulic ended supporting a fascist dictatorship
Although the falange is the fascist party in spain the beginning of the term fascism comes from Musolini wich takes the term from the roman symbol of the Fasces the kind of axe make by a bunch of stacks and a blade wich you can see as symbol of the guardia civil (but for other reasons dont related to fascism)
But honestly that period is very convulse so i prefer to say less then say something wrong
Are you serious
Who started the revolution
Its probably not his fault if its somethibg so systemathic don't blame the teacher
What happened was that there were certain groups that saw war as the means of reaching the revolution and dedicated themselves to this, coming to face each other, the most famous confrontation being that of Barcelona where communist and republican anarchists faced each other
link to the wikipedia page in Spanish
I'm sorry I can't be more precise but with this you should be able to search for the article in English (if there is one) but I prefer to say little than to say something wrong
You're right at pointing that out, but
We finished with the DISASTER OF 98
Everything else was self studied
There IS a systemic problem
However, I believe that as a teacher you can either fight it or let it be
and my history teacher was definetely from the second group
That's not the same that you said in your prior comment, that they started the revolution
I know about the conflicts within the Republican side but they didn't start any revolution in Spain, that was all the "Nationals".
Yes i also noticed you mostly have enough time to reach to the disaster of 98
I don't know how was your teacher, but as in wishing to be in the future a histoey teacher i don't want to blame them for something thwy probably have no control over
lol at least reach the second republic mother of god
I guess its because the most recent topics are still polemic and fresh wounds, they need to be teached but the people who decide what must be teached would prefer to avoid it
maybe i spress myself wrong so im sorry
I hope that whole situation is solved by the time you become a teacher
In fairness it has to be increadibly frustrating not to have enough time
year
After
Year
It must wear you down
I'm just frustrated because
I'm not going to rant about selectividad here, but dear god did I hate the way the exams were made up
I just wished my history teacher had warned us about it the way our literature teacher did
In Spain it depends on the region but where I live classes start at 8:15 am, every hour lasts 55 minutes, there are 6 hours with a 20minute break after every two hours, this is the school day from what would be 7th grade up to 12th
(this was in Spain)
At 8:40 I would meet my friend in front of the school and skip first period to have a cup of coffee with him
After that I would go back and zone out until recess
At recess we would have a beer in the bar beside the school (aptly named "the library") and return to school where I would spend the rest of the day writing short stories in my notebook
I didn't do very well in highschool
Get up at 6:45, wash my face, dress up, take breakfast, go walking to my school, start at 7:55, each class is 55 minutes, we do 2 classes, 25 min break, 2 classes, 20 min break, and 3 or 2 more hours of class, depending on the day
My school days were like this:
Start at 9:00 end at 14:00
30 Minute break at 12:00 for breakfast
5 different classes each day
the first 2 last for one hour, the rest 50 minutes
No breaks between lessons
School starts around 8:30 (mine started at 8:40)
Class lasts 50 minutes with 5 minute pause for teachers and students to go to class and the toilet .
At 11
20 there's a 30 minute break for snacks
School finishes at 14
30 and you have lunch then
&#x200B;
In primary school, in my catholic school we had class from 9 to 13
30, we had lunch at home or at school in the cantine, and we went back at 15
30 to 17
I think now, at least my old school changed it so that all the class is in the morning
I had 1-hour classes divided in two parts from 8:00 to 11:00 and from 11:30 to 14:30
No breaks between classes but a longer break from 11:00 to 11:30 where you usually had a sandwich or some kind of snack to keep you alive until lunch time
I always had 5 minutes between classes
That way you had time to get to your class if it was in another room
I guess this is another very important different bit: in Spain each class is assigned a classroom at the start of the academic year
At least in my experience
You never change classrooms unless it's a special subject like PE or music or art class
The whole classroom changing thing I only saw in American movies and always thought it was funny
Where I study it's more like between classes the time the teacher takes to get to your class is kinda like free time
I ment between PE and art and stuff
I went to highschool in Spain
In 1601 king philip III suddenly ordered the capital be moved to Valladolid
In 1606 it went back to Madrid
Basically it was a HUGE urbanistic complot of his advisor
He bought houses in valladolid, then convinced the king to move the capital, sold them to the crown, bought properties in Madrid, and
you know the drill
This guy moved the capital to be rich-er
He also took bribes
The merchants and financiers of Valladolid paid the Duke of Lerma 50,000 ducats if he had the royal court move to Valladolid
Fast-forward five years, and the financiers of Madrid offered the Duke of Lerma 200,000 ducats if the royal court came back to Madrid
as someone that lives in Valladolid i knew this but im happy to see the story of the only other city that has been a capital of Spain asides from Madrid
Also he bough more houses in Madrid to do the same method
That's the most Belgian thing I've ever heard
**Of course he did**. He was investigated for corruption (probably framed by his political rivals, among them his own son) but he escaped the verdict by becoming a cardenal
It has to be Fallas for me, the festivity to welcome spring
Every month of March, València transforms into this place of pure joy that I cannot even begin to describe
It starts to get a little warm and the sun is so bright, everyone is on the streets, eating churros, hanging out with their friends or relatives, touring the city around watching the [fallas] (huge monuments that we burn on the 19th)
People arrange lunch with their friends and we eat paella under the sun and drink and laugh, and at night time there are dj booths next to every falla and we drink and dance all night
The whole month of march feels like summer and spring all together, everybody is so happy and the whole city is just blooming with joy and people
It's been two years without fallas now, we really miss them
Per cert, feliç Sant Jordi
In Galicia, for me it's Magosto (chestnut festival)
It's celebrated in autumn, and in my village people get together to roast chestnuts and eat together
It's feels like the last time people can get together before the winter sets in and things go quiet, a kind of farewell, until we see each other on the other side
In Madrid, probably San Isidro: music and food everywhere in the older parts of the city, nice weather (it's in mid-May), activities day and night, etc
It's a great way to welcome the sun
I'm from Valencia and my favourite day is [La Gran Nit de Juliol] The great night of July
It is a night in July where you
have plenty of free concerts around the city, the museums are open until late and there are fireworks
It is not as well known as the Fallas but the last few years, before the Covid, it has been great
Some people in Catalonia celebrate both too but I prefer St Jordi because I looooove books :)
Well, I hope you can come back and visit from time to time for St George's day
I used to live in a building in front of Las Vistillas Gardens
I could literally walk outside my door during San Isidro and be in the middle of one of the biggest parties in the city
That was unbeatable
I really miss pre-covid times Spain
Oh yes, I've been to a couple concerts in the river (next to the Palau) in the last summers but I didn't know there were so many activities
I'll keep an eye out for when they start doing it again once it's safe
Well, for all intents and purposes Christmas in Spain lasts 3 weeks, with several landmarks:
* 22nd December - Christmas lottery day
It's not an official festivity but it's undoubtedly part of the celebrations
In the morning the students of the San Ildefonso school draw the numbers of the Christmas lottery, wich is the biggest of the year and popularly known as "el Gordo" (the fat one)
It is kind of traditional to turn on the TV or the radio to hear the rythmical calling of the numbers and know which parts of the country get the prizes
* 24th December - Christmas Eve dinner
For most people this is the main event, when family gathers to have a feast (and I mean it literally, we usually have way too much food)
The King makes a speech right before dinner which will be dissected the following day to extenuation
Old-school Catholics attend a traditional midnight mass
When there's not a plague around, younger people might go out and party instead
* 25th December - Christmas Day lunch
While far less important than the previous dinner, it has also become quite normal to gather with extended family or friends on the 25th to have a more-special-than-usual lunch
The influence of the US has also brought us Santa Claus, who leaves small presents for children, and sometimes for adults that cannot meet on the 6th of January
* 28th December - Innocents Day
This is the Spanish equivalente of April Fools Day
Back in the day even the public TV news joined in the fun and made funny fake reports
Nowadays pranks and jokes seem mostly confined to the Internet, and a special TV program where famous people fool other famous people for charity
* 31st December - New Years Eve
The second biggest event, and sometimes the biggest if for some reason you couldn't make it to Christmas Eve
Depending on your age, financial status, or personal costums, you might have another feast with family or friends, you might party all night long, or you might book a dinner and dance package in a hotel or club
Quirky tradition of the night: instead of counting down loudly, we eat a grape with each of the twelve tolls of the bell at midnight, and then we wish each other a happy new year with our mouths full of mush
* 5th and 6th of January - The Three Kings
On the afternoon of the 5th the Three Kings parade on floats in most towns and cities, often accompanied by Santa Claus, unauthorized Disney characters, relevant local institutions, advertising companies, and others
Candy are thrown out to the public from the floats, sometimes with lethal force
The presents the Magi leave are then handed and open on the 6th
In Catalonia we have one more day in December, the 26th which is Sant Esteve (Saint Stephen's day) and it's celebrated eating canelons for lunch, kind of like the 25th
It's the equivalent of Boxing day
[canelons (cannelloni) ]
Additional info (I'm catalan so mainly it's gonna be info from my region):
• 24th/25th of December: in Catalonia we hit a Christmas decorated log called [Tió de Nadal] with sticks so it shits some presents or candy
It has small legs, a face and Catalonia 's traditional hat called "barretina" glued on top of it
Many schools and kids activities celebrate the Tió before the Christmas break starts, even in swimming classes where you'll hit the Tió with one of those flotation noodles
Defenders of Tió will hate on people who have their gifts brought by Santa Claus
• 26th of December: in some areas we celebrate Saint Stephen's day in which we eat (usually homemade) canelons
These are stuffed with the ground remaining meat from the "escudella", "carn d'olla", turkey, and other leftover ingredients of the previous days
Many families will meet on this day if they couldn't celebrate the 24th or 25th together
• 27th of December: my birthday
Not a national holiday, but it should be
• 31st of December: You will not be able to send a text or make a phone call for a few minutes after 00:00 hits, since we flood all social media with happy new year texts and calls
It doesn't matter if you haven't talked to someone for years, you'll probably get a text from them
Most people just hit the "send to all" button and get over with it
Kids and people who don't like grapes eat Lacasitos, which are similar to M&Ms
Also the ER of hospitals get a lot of cases of people who choked with the grapes
You'll give hugs and kisses on the cheek to everyone in the room, not just one kiss on the mouth with your special person
• 1st of January: some religious people go to mass, Spain's national television broadcasts the Vienna New Year's Concert in the morning (so if you went partying the night before and you live with your parents you'll probably wake up listening to it and it will fuck with your hangover)
You either eat a nice lunch or leftovers from the previous days
Also many people go to the beach and have the first swim of the year, some of them with Santa hats or fully dressed
Middle aged people will not stop joking about they haven't showered since last year
Young people who went partying will probably smell like they haven't showered in a year
Some people will still be partying until the 2nd of January
• 5th of January: Spanish grandmas will fight you to get the candy thrown in the parade, literally
I've seen them push, hit you with a purse, and step on other people's hands when they reach for candy on the floor
Some people put umbrellas upside down to get the candy (it's frowned upon though, and people will confront you)
People carry ladders to the streets so their kids/themselves have a better view of the parade
Balconies on the streets the parade goes through are rented for the same reason, at expensive prices
Kids will go home and count the candy, separate it, and then brag how much they got
• 6th of January: national "we had to take the batteries from all electronics in the house so kids could play" day
Some kid will unplug their grandma from the breathing machine just so they can use the PS5
• 7th-8th of January: kids usually get the 7th off from school so they can keep playing with the new toys, and on the first day of school the little kids bring one toy to school to show it off and play with their friends
Not sure this is still done
• 31st of January: people will start to question whether or not they should throw the Christmas tree away
The 26th of December here in Mallorca is called Segona Festa or “second party”, where you usually gather with your family for lunch or dinner
And you have the Caga Tió... lol
Practically all Spaniards eat the grapes with the midnight bells on the 31
Yeah,  but that's the 24th
Depends on the area, everyone I know celebrates it on la Nit de Nadal
I'm gonna add this to the comment
What we do in my family (I'm still 18 so still a thing for me :P ) is being with one side of the family in Christmas Eve (my father's) and with the other (my mother's) in New Years Eve and the Three King's day, January the 6th
Not this year obviously though
Yes, that's true
In another comment I said that TIL that it can be the 24th or the 25th, I always thought that it was the 24th for everyone
I just learned that Caga tió is celebrated on Christmas eve and the 25th
Where I'm from it's always the 24th
I'm guessing you didn't knew either and I'm your area it's the 25th
Christmas day celebration is widespread nowadays in Catalonia
[caga tió (catalan) ]
Ahhhhh that makes sense
I don't think so, in my family we've always celebrated it the 24th, always
You're just making assumptions
That's a bold statement with nothing to prove it
As I told you, I didn't now that others celebrated it the 25th so we both learned something today
Bon Nadal
No, just by the sight no, could be a Portuguese or Italian or even French
By I would instantly recognize my buddies by the speech volume
Spaniard living in the UK
I can spot other Spaniards from miles away
In fact, I don't need to see them, just hear them
As for a face I would instantly recognize as Spanish: [here]
Now that I've been living here for 3 years, I'd say the average UK bloke is, depending on age,
* old: short, fat with a bear belly and skinny arms and legs, bold, pink colour of skin and face
* young: all with the same haircut where the sides and back are almost down to zero and there's a "step", no gradual transition to the hair on the top
I wonder why on earth this horrible hairstyle is so damn common
Pretty sure that’s my ex
He was 7ft 1 from The Hague
I have friends that look mexicans, jewish, arabs, others instead seem pure blood castillians (not to tall but wide shoulders), some could look italian, french, portuguese or whatever, and then there is the ones who look north European if it wasnt because im not really tall i could look more british german, or for some even slav than spanish, specially friends from the south and tourist zones always tell me so
Yeah, I've been to Portugal a lot and we all look pretty similar
You probably have less redheads though; we have a few of those in the north, but I've never seen any in Portugal
¡Grande Pepe Viyuela
Jajajaja
Wow, wouldn't have thought that hairstyle was so common in UK
I think [he] has very common catalan features AND haircut
He's an actor, he usually plays comedy:
And fake tan, so much fake tan
When I left the UK a female English coworker bought me fake tan, I've never used it
[like this woman ]
That guy looks like he could be from any Mediterranean country, to be honest
I know, he's from Girona, but still his features are very common in Catalonia
I don't know why you think such small distance will make people look different, honestly
I mean, it's mainly used by chavs and certain groups
There are many sensible women there who don't use it but it's far too common to ignore it
Spain is overall quite touristy, but I guess the big cities (Barcelona and Madrid) and the islands (Canary and Balearic) are the ones that have (or used to have given the current situation) the most tourism
However all of the coastal towns/cities (Valencia, Alicante, Cadiz
) also host a lot of the domestic tourism
Magaluf
It's sad that the tourists normally go to the ugliest part of the island
I'm from Spain and I think Barcelona is the most visited area
The other ones also visited are some cities of the community of Valencia (Alicante, Valencia etc) and Madrid is also visited
I have a friend living in Brussels and she took me to Bruges and Ghent and they're both lovely
I mean, Bruges is a UNESCO world heritage site and if I recall correctly it's one of the best preserved medieval places and its the most visited Belgian city so
Chocolate, my friend
It's like mixing Venice and Bavaria
And not as expensive as the Netherlands
I would definitely say Barcelona for oversee tourists and the islands for european tourists
Madrid is the capital and as that it of course also recieves tons of tourists, but Barcelona is just so crowded of Asian and American tourists to another level
But of course, all of the South and East coast also gets the attention, and the North (Camino de Santiago) isn´t unpopular either
I think you are forgetting la Costa del Sol: Málaga, Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Mijas and Marbella are totally saturated every summer, plus there is a lot of retired people who are here the whole year, from UK, Belgium, Germany
Yes, it is hard to say when the entire country is just extremely touristy I guess hahaha, but this year I’ve seen a rise in tourism to places like the northern coasts, or some less touristy coastal towns, just covid things
Benidorm here has been already colonized by germans and British people, and so is Mallorca aswell
I know that it's all about weather, but I don't understand why apparently not many tourists visit the north
Our north (Santander, Basque Country, Asturias, Galicia,...) is absolutely astonishing and beautiful
Surprisingly, Madrid hosted almost 1
700
000 more tourists than Barcelona in [2018] (talking cities, not regions: Madrid 9
716
708, Barcelona 8
045
642)
But this data takes into account both domestic and foreign tourists
Madrid triples the domestic tourist cipher of Barcelona, but Barcelona recieves the most tourist from outside the country
In [2019] and 2020, Madrid repeated as the most visited city in Spain in total numbers
When considering only international tourists, Barcelona continues to be first in both years
It's a nice town, but I'd never say the best place in Spain
There are better beaches or prettier towns in Andalucía
Yes, US states are generally known
Perhaps the not so famous ones you do not know where to put them in the map, but you know they are US's states
Yeah, we know the states by name (don't ask US to name them all)
We Don't know where they are though
If you ask a random guy in the streets where kentucky or ohio IS in a map, he'll just point somewhere in the middle
I'd like to add that powerful sounding names of native american origin like Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wyoming
are instantly recognised as american
It's like saying "I'm from Chongqing, a province in China". Well, no shit
I, personally, know the name of (almost) all the states just by watching them on series, films, videogames, or just talking with people from the US, (with the exception of Washington, I just discovered it was called like that today lmao)
I can even point [some of them] in a map, mainly the most famous ones, the coastal ones, and some of them I had reasons to know (mainly because I like overall American history) for example I liked Minnesota Timberwolves back in the day, Misisipi, or Kentucky (and, of course, those that used to belong to the empire, such as California or Florida
P.S If you want to try the test for yourself you can find it [here] :)
Yes, pretty common to know the names of all (or almost all) US states
You have to understand that half the movies/tv shows we watch are american, your country does a lot of cultural exports and you always talk a lot about states
I dont know all i would just recignice names but axide the virginias florida california new york and others with very recognicable forms as texas but most of them no
but we all know that puerto rico want into usa
It’s also the only us state capital without a McDonald’s
I think most people would recognize many names as American States, even if they're not able to name themselves off the top of their heads
Most people that consume a lot of American media, which is, well, most people, would know that places such as Oregon, Massachussets, Kansas, Virginia, Michigan or Ohio are American states if they hear the names
> save perhaps New York
You may believe New York's capital is New York, but it's actually Albany
Albuquerque, New Mexico also takes the name from a Spanish town, but it's Albu**r**querque, Extremadura
I guess names drift as time goes on
>As the average includes senile old farts who believe aggricukturee is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized, and that we need back franco to bring back virtue in the country and reform the decadent yiuth
Nah, have you seen a population density map of Spain
We Don't have aggrikultors any more
That section of the population IS so small and so far away from the rest they have very little impact in the shape of the country
Bring back Franco isn't that popular either
though i've Heard old people saying they lived better under Franco
So all in all we don't have so many "old farts". Actually vox (our far right wing party) IS going for the youth
>is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized,
And i've never Heard that
If you only count where people actually live, Spain IS higher than the netherlands in population density
we just have vast expanses of almost nothing
Roughly two hungaries with only 7 million people
We're much more cosmopolitan that we may appear
And I always understand CA as Canada
Yeah, that's what I mean
I feel it's a fair distinction to make
People do recognize many of the states, even if they can't list them themselvs
Yeah, our morons are just different
The stardard only admits 2 letters for country
US for USA, CA for Canada, CH for Switzerland and so on
No es lo mismo una pelota vieja que una vieja en pelotas
An old ball is not the same as a naked old woman
I don't think Spanish allows that thing to happen
Arabic seems really tough
Without any doubt Japanese
It’s complexity gets to a point of simple being absurd
If we are talking about European languages, probably any non-Indo-European language or the grammatical complexity of German would be the hardest
Also Polish is completely unpronounceable
I've only tried to learn English and German, and I speak natively Spanish and Catalan
I'd say in order from easiest to hardest (trying to be objective) are: English, Spanish, Catalan, German
Kudos to Estonian
You thought the 4 German cases were hard
Try with the 14 cases in Estonian
(maybe it was 16, I'm not so sure anymore)
Basque, no doubt
Being able to speak both languages (Spanish is my mother tongue, but I've been living in Germany for almost 4 years now) I would say it is easier to learn the basic of Spanish, but it is way harder to become proficient in Spanish than it is in German
IMO up to B1 Spanish is easier, up to C1 German is easier
Fuck yes
Of course, I'm feeling very lucky even tough Spain is not the best place in Europe
But there are 7500 million people in this world and I'm pretty sure 6800 million have it worse, so I'm lucky to be in the top10%
I’m extremely glad I’m european
I mean an EU citizen
Yes, even if sometimes i'd wish there were even more conveniences
I don't feel like a socialist, but I love all the consumer/worker/life protections that we have in Europe
It feels like we have most of the freedom that Americans enjoy but with a lot of rules/protections so that we all can enjoy life
I agree
They don't track who voted what, but they do track who votes, you could vote twice if they didn't. At least they do here in Spain, dunno about other countries
Is it in school when you lads have your first contact with the Irish language or is it common at home for parents to teach their children a few words
We know our government is far too incompetent to keep secrets from us
And even if they were we are far too apathetic
Some people tend to believe that, the fire of the "Windsor Tower" (a building in Madrid) was intentionally started by someone
You can look for more information on the Internet, but basically, it burned at the last hours of the evening (almost night), there were no victims and the official report said that it was started by a cigarette
I personally believe in that it was made intentionally
Some years ago it wasn't that obvious, but it has been recently discovered that some big companies were trying to destroy documents, and so they did it "cleanly", with no victims, and everything seemed like an accident
As a joke we say galicia/murcia (parts of spain) doesn't exist
Don't know how extended over Spain is though
> Velvet revolution was not a peoples uprising but actually a planned  power transfer
That one is actually interesting, since a lot of people  that came to power after the revolution were on very prominent places of  power or knowledge in the old regime while the "political" faces of the  regime get deposited
But I just think that those are the type of  morally flexible shitstains that would flourish in any regime
And yes
I  mean our curent prime minister, our current president and our previous  president
Yeah, I mean, those things always happen to an extent
The politicians come and go, the bureaucracy is eternal
Happened with the Nazis in Germany (many of whom ended up as policemen or Bundeswehr officers after the war, etc
), happened to us in Spain, etc
It's just nigh-impossible to to remove the whole administrative apparatus of a State and start anew, you need to keep some people who know how to run things (even if you guillotine everyone above them), and then more often than not they will stay in power or gain further power
Yeah, those are always very funny xD Like, Cervantes, Columbus, etc
were all Catalan and the evil Castilian government rewrote the history books to cheat the world into believing otherwise
It makes you wonder, if the Castilian/Spanish government is so powerful to play a 500-year con on the whole world, why don't they just use their omnipotence to crush those pesky Catalan rebels xD
For the other side of the coin, there's a fair bunch of people who reallyl belive that Mr
Soros is trying to break Catalonia away from Spain, for whatever reason
In fact, if I google "soros" the second auto-complete option (after his name) is Spanish for "Soros is breaking Spain" xD Oh, and of course, he is also orchestrating the arrival of trillions of black muslims, because of course he is
And in Spain Soros wants to make Catalonia independent, promote LGBT+ degeneracy and so much more
My God, the dude is EVERYWHERE
She completed the immortality event chain, that's why she's still around
That sounds pretty complicated
maybe there should be a state department or a ministry
yeah, a Ministry of Magic to deal with that
I actually haven't heard a lot about Soros in our far right, the boogeyman is usually some shadowy cabal of Catalans, Chavistas or feminists
Remember, rule number one of the Internet is that no matter how bonkers, someone still believes it xD See the Google results for "soros rompiendo españa" if you'd like (I tried linking it, but Reddit doesn't like search result links)
Vox and the people in their orbit do mention him every so often
For example, see [here] They don't mention him as commonly as in many other countries, granted
Yes
I'm Spanish, and Spain didn't participate in WW2
But when the Spanish Civil War started, my great-grandfather decided to move to Germany to avoid going to war and being killed by the opposite band
Unfortunately WW2 started, so he was forced to fight in it
He never returned to Spain because he started a new life in Germany, so we don't know anything about what he lived in WW2
Pretty amazing in Catalan and Spanish, but usually not as complete as the English one obviously
Fun fact: the Catalan Wikipedia was the third one to be created after the English and the German ones, and the second edition that started publishing articles (apparently the German one was created earlier but it took a while until they started releasing posts)
I don't really enjoy the Spanish one
For most general topics that are very good in English, the Spanish counterpart reads either as a mediocre translation or as written by a high-schooler, a teenager fan or a computer-illiterate manager
People look at me like I were crazy when I state this opinion, but frankly, I've read a lot all of my life and I can't shake the feeling that it's subpar in general
Of course there are some high-quality pages, but they're scarcer to the point that Spanish Wikipedia is my last resort, or for Spanish topics where the depth of info is better, no matter the writing quality
I use Wikipedia in Spanish, is really great, but I saw that the design is different in French and English
I'd say it's pretty good on number of articles, but it sometimes severely lacks references or the ones that are provided are shitty
I prefer to use the English wikipedia
The Spanish one have plenty of articles translated with google translator, while others are very badly written
Maybe I am wrong but I think I saw somewhere that catalan Wikipedia has more articles than the Spanish one lol
You're right
With the exception of articles about Spanish stuff, most articles are really bad, it's like you said, most of them are bad translations from the English one and always with less text, like if they got tired translating half-way
honestly the wikipedia shouldnt be the source of anything
better go to specialist pages in english or spanish (or other language if you know mor)
there is something wrong with the slovakian one
also a lot of lack in terms of information in a lot of subjects
It was true at some point, but not anymore by a long shot (1,671,748 vs 675,472):  It's still pretty amazing considering the number of speakers of both languages
Definitel, so crazy, thanks for the data check
Yes, it's what most people drink, and it's safe to drink basically everywhere in the country, although some prefer bottled water
It's true bottled water usually tastes a bit better but I don't think it's worth the effort of spending more money in water and having to bring 2-3 litres per day per person of water from a store
Even when I visit the Mediterranean area (where water is known to taste pretty badly) I just drank tap water
I got used to the taste after a couple of days anyway
When I used to live in Valencia (Spain) which is a Mediterranean city I never ever would drink from the tap
Even when the water is perfectly safe and drinkable the content of minerals (mostly calcium) made it taste like hell
Not even adding flavour works
Only a expensive domestic water softener makes it bearable
Other parts of Spain as Madrid has an amazing water with great taste, but usually south and east coast cities does not
Now I live in Scotland and I always drink from the tap, my hair as well looks amazing here
It depends on the area
In Barcelona I'll never drink from the tap since I don't like the taste, but I know people who do (my dad) and say it's fine
I know in other areas it's usual to do so and in rural towns people bring large bottles and use public fountains to get drinking water
But you won't get tap water in restaurants or bars, it's always bottled water (or at least I've never been in one that serves it)
*And then there's the people from Madrid*. They will tell anyone that their tap water is amazing and will fight you to death if you say it sucks
They're the won't-shut-up-about-it vegans of tap water
If you don't use chlorine, then how is your water kept safe
Ozone
You found the only waiter that wouldn't give you water; practically anywhere they'll happily give you a glass of water if you ask them kindly, even if you didn't buy anything haha
I think you're correct, the law says that all restaurants, bars, night clubs and such are forced to offer bottled water and (if I'm not mistaken) tap water
It might have to do with charging tourists even more
Selling water to hordes of thirsty northern european tourists must be really profitable
The huge public budget we have to allocate to [pensions] and retirement
Its literally a ponzi scheme, the new retirees are already making way less money than the old ones, and the next ones will get even less
The people theorically paying for their own retirement with taxes today are guaranteed to get nearly nothing back
Most retirees have more income than people aged 20 to 34
I would say that the politicians are ultimeteley and irredimeably incompetent but you asked for things Europe doesnt know
It's funny because my experience was the opposite
I lived there a few years ago and I was absolutely amazed by how buses and trams were consistently on schedule down to the minute
Except once that I had to take a night bus line for the airport and it just didn't show up
But I think it was my fault in the sense that it was probably a special line that worked differently and I just disregarded that
But I did meet a Polish guy earlier this year and he indeed told me Wrocław is kind of known for public transport unreliability
Perhaps it's just gone to shit these literal past years because that's really not the experience I had
This is lowkey fascinating and hilarious
Sadly true
(I "live" in Granada)
XD I live there only when I have university classes I AM ALIVE
Probably just in Spain
The market is huge
In Spain is really easy to get a job as English teacher
I mean with some qualification, but being english speaker make things easy
It's sad, I could have gone for way longer but then Wroclaw appeared :'v
Bochum
Germany was getting more difficult by the second, without them I think I would've gotten much farther
Edit: there's 6 cities I don't know: 3 Germans, 2 Romanians and 1 polish
Ah, it was an important city, historically
Back in the day, Spain was the combination of Castille and Aragon at its core (I don't want to open a can of worms here, but perhaps think of England/Scotland or summat)
Castille's power became centred on Madrid after some time being iterant or in Toledo, and Aragon's was somewhat split between Zaragoza and Barcelona
Zaragoza (also known in English as Saragossa) was where Aragon had its origins, and where its kings were crowned, so it was sort of a historic capital of Aragon
However, Barcelona became more important within the Crown of Aragon as it was the actual power centre and economic powerhouse, eclipsing Zaragoza as time went on
Zaragoza nowadays is the capital of the autonomous community of Aragon
All but four
That's impressive
Well, taking into account more people have failed with Germany than poland I wouldn't read too much into it
I knew all but one of the polish cities
I didn't know 3 German cities
Except the Germans almost noone has heard of Duisburg, Bochum, Wuppertal and Bielefeld
Oh, vaguely
I wouldn't say I know enough
Those 2 Romanian cities are there so noone gets to the end
They guard the exit
>Łódź
So it's like a dog barking
They bark guau, so not very similar
Yeah, it's pronounced ˈɡwau̯...tbh it's not very similar
That's because you haven't seen:
**GÜISQUI**
Ps: yeah, it only shares **two letters** with the original word
Lol, never saw it spelled that way although it's probably the correct way to do so in Spanish
Do t try to learn everything at once, it's a simple language with some very complicated nuances
We write 5 vowels, we pronounce 5 vowels
There is little ambiguity here, so try to pronounce them correctly and don't close them too much
Open your mouth as you speak
We have phonemes which are new or difficult for most foreign speakers, and even those who learn Spanish fluently usually never get used to them, so I would say try to practice and refine your strong - rr and - z early
H does not exist, don't let it distract you
Spanish is simpler than most languages in almost every grammatic aspect except for verbs
We have some of the most complicated verb conjugations, but they don't have cases
You can manage with just a few, and there is a very clear order of frecuency (pretérito perfecto compuesto > pretérito perfecto simple > subjuntivo >>>> futuro de subjuntivo)
Note that for speaking correctly you'll end up having to deal with most of them, but trying to get the whole table for every verb from the get go is a pain in the ass
We swear a lot and it's no big deal
Por favor Y gracias will improve almost any sentence you say
Also, there's a difference between Tú and Usted, and it's completely different from American Spanish, try to not mix them up
Lastly, there is a big difference between ser and estar
It is very clear for native speakers and almost impossible to explain using logic, but it's something you will struggle with
Think of it as a nice philosophic puzzle
Is the essence of the being changed fundamentally
Ser
If it's transitory  estar
IDK, this should be mostly a matter of practice, like genres
Also, open your question marks (¿?) or your writing will be mediocre
Most of all, have fun
The Spanish love to see others learn their language, and you'll get lots of jokes and cool useless word from your friends
Learn the nouns with the article so you won’t miss the gender
And for English speakers learn that the verb _to be_ becomes two verbs in Spanish _ser_ and _estar_
For the gender it is really foreign when someone uses the wrong gender in the article like in city _ciudad_ You should learn it as a whole not as a word
So you learn _la ciudad_ “the city” and not _ciudad_ “city” this will help you a lot because it’s feminine in Spanish
In Spanish there’s a rule (which hopefully will help)
if the last syllable contains an “a” 99% will be feminine if it contains an “o” 99% will be masculine
There are some words like “motorbike” _moto_ that has an “o” but is feminine or _cava_ (the drink) which is masculine but this cases and the following one are minimal
Then you have the mix of both, you have “the sea” _el mar_ or _la mar_ this one is tricky, if you refer to the sea as a water body or geographically you will use _el mar_ if you refer to anything related to any activity you can perform there (swimming, fishing, etc) you will use _la mar_
About the verb _to be_:
In English you can say: _he is good_ which depending on context will say that he behaves good or that he is feeling good
In Spanish you will use _él está bien_ to say he is feeling good and you will use _él es bueno_ to say he behaves good
Both are translated as “He is good”
The most difficult part is probably tenses
We have around 10 tenses for the past in different configurations
Depending on the region you're in some are used and some are archaic
Generally composite tenses (haber+ participle) will be understood by everyone and it's less words to learn
Spanish has a ton of exceptions in ortography and grammar, but most of it follows some rules
If you learn the rules you are out of much truble
And try to speak as much as you can
We're all very happy to help you to learn Castellano
It’s feminine is Spanish as well: _la ciudad_
In Spanish there’s a rule, if the last syllable contains an “a” 99% will be feminine if it contains an “o” 99% will be masculine
There are some words like “motorbike” _moto_ that has an “o” but is feminine or _cava_ (the drink) which is masculine
On top of that you have “the sea” _el mar_ or _la mar_ this one is tricky, if you refer to the sea as a water body or geographically you will use _el mar_ if you refer to anything related to any activity you can perform there (swimming, fishing, etc) you will use _la mar_
Edit: I think I should add this comment as an answer as well
Not a great deal, but your accent will always be distinguishable
Because you're not used to it
When we learn English, you'd be surprised how many sound we have to adjust to, and many never do
But I think it's cool that human language has so many possibilities
It's noticeably hard for a Spanish to pronounce a word starting with several consonants, like stop
It's hard not to say "estop", and it's something you will notice most of us struggle with
Your h sound mixes up with our strong J, so I know many people that pronounce a very strong How or Horse, etc
We also don't distinguish b and v, so that's a new thing to get used to, and the soft s was particularly difficult for me (although I can't remember if it's important in English, I had to learn it for German)
That's all I can think of, off the top of my head
Oh, that's very interesting
I never thought u would be a difficult letter, but I admit it is a a bit of an extreme mouth position
The contrary is true for us: when we start out tye closest we can say is 'do llu like
' (as an English J sound)
In hollywood movies all european countries are blue
All our languages have singular and plural forms, and we all use the metric system, we all have had monarchies at one point or another
I mean,in Spain the WWs didn't exactly happen on our soil,but to say we remained unscratched would be a lie
We didn't participate in WW2, but we have had some many wars between each other that your point still holds
I mean, we've been fighting between us since the first civilizations were formed, it's a miracle that we are doing something together now
That would be awesome, but I don't think that would happen any time soon
Don't worry, you're not alone in this
Not the north, they were too busy axing people while europeans built something big
Same, i love ESC, and i was so sad about this year's "thing". We're now in 2021 season now
Happy cake day
Yeah, young people in Spain is mostly atheist
I guess that we have that in common, for what I know most European countries  are evolving to that
Yeah but it didn't even happen nor did we participate but we ended up as or even in worse condition than participating countries
Now it is Luxembourgs turn
The EU feels safe
\- When you leave the door open: "Do you think we are in the Franco era
" (If you don't know, Franco was a spanish dictator in the XX century and thieves feared him
There's also a popular saying: "In Franco era you could go out for hours leaving the door open and nothing would happen")
\- In closed mouth, flies don't get in (In spanish it's: "En boca cerrada no entran moscas")
\- If you say "I'm bored" some mothers may say: "Then eat a donkey" (In spanish "I'm bored" is traduced as "me aburro", and "Then eat a donkey" is traduced as "Pués cómete un burro". It's a spanish rhyme)
And much more than actually i can't even remember
Not exclusive of Spanish mothers, but a common one among small children who pick their noses is  asking if they are searching for oil
I am spanish andm y dad used to tell me this:
If you are cold go to your uncles underpants
you ask your parents for money and they respond:
"Do you think we are the Bank of Spain
when they think you haven't eat enough, it is typically said:
"Do you want me to fry you an egg
If you play with Fire you'll pee on
In Spain we say "close the door or the cat will escape", even if you don't have a cat
Not technically my country, but involved:
Until recently, it was legal to kill Basque people (from the Basque country) in Iceland
[Source]
the word "donut" is a registered trademark by Panrico Donuts(tm), so companies like "dunkin donuts" had to rename to operate in the spanish market (Dunkin coffee in this case)
the word "corona" (crown in spanish) is also registered, so the beer Corona is called "coronita" (Small crown) here
[heres a bunch of town-specific laws too if you want a chuckle]
I wouldn't want to walk on a stone street with high heels either, in fear that the heel would get stuck between the stones
What defines something as a bathroom
Not every bathroom has a bath, or a shower, or a toilet, or a sink
Mostly
Spanish is phonetically consistent, but has a few letters which sound the same
"ge" and "gi" sound the same as "je" and "ji", for example
Also, the h is completely silent and is sometimes found in the middle of a word, like in "zanahoria". So that can lead to mistakes as well
I'm Spanish, so yes, I can actually spell all (or almost all) words just hearing them one single time
Not quite, no
You can know how a word is pronounced by its spelling, but not the other way around, as there's a few letters that are pronounced the same
*b* and *v* (yeah, we pronounce them the same in Spanish), *y* and *ll*, and there's *h* which has no sound, *g* followed by *e* and *i* is pronounced like *j*. There's a few other letters with the same pronunciation, but those usually have rules so you can know when to write each (*c* and *z*)
In any case, a lot of words can be spelled from hearing them, as there's also a bunch of rules that determine spelling
Yes, in Spanish everything is written as it sounds, in fact if I just create a word right now that no spaniard has ever heard, everyone would pronounce it the same way
Mostly, yes
One of the few good things about German language, it is usually spelled how you say it
Please, don't mind if I make some changes to make it more correct:
Tragé el puto baso al lavabajías de mierda y me comí una zanaória cojonuda y un calabacin que te cagas con licor café.
Tienes nivel V2
My dad calls it ‘su oficina’ (his office)
I usually say "el trono" (the throne)
If it's dirty we say "el tigre", the tiger, because of the smell
El trono (the throne)
Sala de pensar (Thinking room)
El señor Roca (Mr
Roca), Roca is a common brand of bathroom equipment and furniture
The Rock, because there's this very famous brand of toilets called "Roca" (Rock in english)
"El cagodromo" - The *shit-o-drome*
Trono (Throne)
The same here in spain
something long or something with ñ
ñoñeria
or esternocleidomastoideo
El perro de San Roque no tiene rabo porque Ramón Ramírez se lo ha robado
It's a tong twister but I always enjoy seeing foreigners trying to pronounce the hard r.
I've heard that our combination of "sz" sound is difficult for foreigners
So maybe words like "piscina" or "ascender" would do
This only works with European Spanish though
I also had a Dutch friend who had problems with words like "arbitrariamente", "condescendientemente" (sc/sz bonus) or "inconstitucionalmente".
He took revenge by making me pronounce the "having sex in the kitchen" sentence someone already mentioned in the comments lol
Also long ass words like desoxirribonucleico, esternocleidomastoideo or supercalifragilisticoespialidoso, I guess
Or tongue twisters like "Tres tristes tigres comen trigo en un trigal". Especially if you have trouble rolling your R's.
I don't try to make them say anything, there's enough fun whenever they try to say anything with an R, like the word *raro* (weird)
Oh, we have a similar one:
Tres tristes tigres comían trigo en un trigal
Un tigre, dos tigres, tres tigres
It's pretty hard to say when you're drunk, even as a native speaker, because it alternates very similar sounds (tre, tri, ti)
I always go for something with 'rr' and with 'll'
>Eichhörnchen
from someone learning german - came here to say this
v and b has the same sound in spanish (although some people try to diferenciate them)
Or a h
I think that's why he said it haha
lol sorry
&#x200B;
i fell vilified
\- Tío (literally uncle)
\- Hermano (brother)
\- Colega (mate)
You can also find by regions:
\- Socio (partner, but platonical)
\- Tronco (trunk, log), typical in Madrid
\- Quillo/Illo (from *chiquillo*, kid), in Andalusia
Bonus track: *pisha* for boys and *shosho* for girls, in Cádiz, literally meaning dick and pussy
Maybe "compá" is what west sicilians from Palermo say, but in Catania people use to say "mbare" (also coming from "compare")
And let me address that "compare" comes directly from the spanish influence, since "compadre" means basically "friend".
I'm from Asturias, in the north
I almost exclusively use *tío* (lit
"uncle", but another meaning would be "dude")
I use *macho* (lit
"male") a few times, and I've seen it used
Apart from that, I guess I've heard *hermano* (lit
"brother")
Macho (male) is very common in Madrid as well, probably the most common after tío.
and add Acho/Acha for us folks in Murcia
Also every single insult that exists in the Spanish language
Nano in Valencia
>\- Quillo/Illo (from chiquillo, kid), in Andalusia
>Bonus track: pisha for boys and shosho for girls, in Cádiz, literally meaning dick and pussy
But those are not a term for friends, you use them with everybody, unknow people too (the same for tio)
I do like to use tronco and tronca, basically means tree log
I Aragón (mostly Zaragoza) we use "co" (from chico) as a vocative i.e "¿Co amigo que haces
It's regarded as a very working class/uncultured expression though, even if everyone uses it from time to time
Edit: Maño/a is also very common to refer to a friend, it's literally just the demonym of Zaragoza
Fill de puta for extra points
I often say Hola gilipollas to my friends
I mean I've never seen anyone say hi with that
Ieee fill
de putaaa
That is also used a lot where I live
That's similar to silly, used often between couples and really close friends
We have the same story in Spain but It happens in granada
So Saint Nick is a guiri
interesting
It happens in Cordoba, in Medina Azahara
I don't really agree with this meaning, but this is copied from wikipedia:
*Guiri (pronounced [ˈɡiɾi]) is a colloquial Spanish slur used in Spain applied to foreign tourists, particularly from countries in northern Europe or the Anglosphere
Many people don't really use it as a slur as we don't really see anything peyorative in the word or about being a foreigner, but some cities have tourist problems so it can be a slur depending on the context (not as horroble as the d, r, f or n words though)
To me it would mean "tourist from other (usually northern Europe or the Anglosphere) who looks and acts like the stereotype and falls into tourist traps". And well, I look like a guiri to most Spanish people, so it has become my nickname too
A tourist from another country
That's the secret: we call you guys guiris
but we are also guiris
Here every town and city has its local festival or fair, and I dare say that practically all of them celebrate it with fireworks, usually a show is organized on the last day of the festival
The best known bcs its love of gunpowder and fire is the Fallas in Valencia, although I don't know if the [mascletá] can be considered fireworks (they are more like firecrackers
It is also quite common to see them at other celebrations such as weddings, birthdays or I don't know, for those who like fireworks any excuse is good
In recent years, the number of people who do not want fireworks because of the damage they cause to autistic people and animals (dogs basically, because we already have cities with [more dogs than children] has increased, so they may end up being restricted in some way in the future
Fallas in Valencia, they make a giant statues and then they set them on fire, and in a nitgh in that celebration we make "La nit del foc" (from valencian/catalan "the night of the fire") where they use a lot of fireworks and it is incredible, we have also the mascletá but in that case it is used firecrackes
10/10 i would recommend it
I used to go to Alicante in Saint johns night and the thing is HUGE
Fire crackers all day and then the mascletá. It's INCREADIBLE
Though i suppose It can get really tiring if you have a pet
I would not consider mascletà as proper fireworks (although I really love it, even more than fireworks) but during fallas you have mascletà every evening at 14:00 and also [fireworks show] every night at 00:00 (except last night when we have the big one: la nit del foc, at 1:30)
Something also interesting that is done with fireworks in a few villages on their festivities are the [toros de fuego]
I'm not an expert, but i'll try to explain what they do
The main part are the paper mache giant sculptures/ monuments
They're marked by judges, and they win prizes, the BEST, the most original, etc
During at least a few days there's firecrackets continuously, fireworks at night and bonfires by the beach
It's total Madness
It all ends with a Big procession where all but the BEST sculpture are burned to the ground:
>little scary
Yeah, i went as a kid and It scared the shit out of me
By the third time you're a bit more used to It
King Alfonso XIII of Spain wrote the script for three porn movies
Well, I have two stories
One is the story of how the USA dropped a fucking nuclear bomb in the Palomares beach (Almería) in1966 and dictator Franco sent one of his ministers to Bath there and show the people how safe it was which was a continuous joke among Spaniards because we knew it wasn't so
Even now there's still a great deal of radiation (and people dying) on that area and the USA didn't do shit to clean it
The other story, and much older, is the Esquilache riots, in the XVIII century the Spanish Minister the Marqués of Esquilache decided that long capes and broad hats must be banned to favour facial recognition of thugs and criminals and people was so against it that the rioted
It went so bad that the king had to move from Madrid to Aranjuez and he sent the army
In the end they had to convince people to use short capes the French way telling them that it was more fashionable and that the executioners were the ones wearing long capes and with this silly solution he barely scaped the insurrection
Goya painted his "motín de Esquilache" to reference that stupid moment in our history
The time Murcia wanted to become an American State
France: yo, Spain, we really want to invade Portugal, is it cool of we cut through
Spain: yeah, no worries bro
It's not like Napoleon is slowly conquering all of Europe are anything
France: *invades Spain*
Spain: *surprised Pikachu face*
All the Borbones have great stories about pornography and "sinful" lifestyle, so I'm not surprised at all
Alfonso XIII was a man who saw the oportunity and took it, he embraced the technology with open arms
Also, one of his ministers (the good old Romanones) produced porn films in Paris and brought them to Spain
Was that the king that arrived in Spain, and after he saw the fucking mess we had here he just said "Fuck this shit" and left
Wait what
Are they on porn hub
I have to watch these
I see your ship, and raise [an entire navy
By the way, we called the armada "the invincible"
Yeah, royal inbreeding was bad
I also heard that people were mad at the ban of long capes because at the time Madrid didn't have a sewer system and it smelled terrible so people used the capes to cover their nose
I couldn't find any source in English, so here's one in Spanish:
No, they didn't. They were close to reach a solution but in the end there wasn't a signed agreement between both governments (the Spanish government at that time was only in functions) and then came Trump and everything got stopped
I haven't heard about that but it's possible
Thanks for sharing
[Long answer]
Short answer: Cartagena was under a 6 month siege by the Spanish central government and sent a letter to Ullises S. Grant proposing that Cartagena became a similar thing to Gibraltar
Obviouly it never happened
For what I can read, there might be more
The article says those are the only ones conserved
When you go ro live to another EU country you are like and have to be treated like a national of the country you are living  now, same rights, same duties, same benefits, same taxes
Barriers:
Language
Have no fucking idea about what paperwork is needed, specially taxes hahahah
I am a spanish living in slovakia, all was fucking alien to me for almost 1 year hahahaha
I moved to the UK back in the good old days when it was still part of the EU
Hopped on a plane, got here, rented a flat with a couple of friends and applied for a social security number (very easy to do)
That's it
For healthcare, here you have to register with your local General Practice (GP)
Again, very easy process
Each country has their own version of a sc number or resident ID, with different names, and different processes
Same for registering for healthcare, the process varies
But essentially, you just need to tell the government "hey, I live here now", and that's pretty much it
That doesn't mean they can kick you out, though
Each country has their own rules and can deport you if you don't meet certain criteria
I think in the UK it was something like "if you don't have a job after a number of months and you don't have savings, you're out". But I think they rarely enforced it
It's not a political or administrative issue anyways
Nobody in Spain ever called "La armada invencible" like that (that name is product of British propaganda) its official name was "La grande y felicísima armada" (the great and the most happy armada)
but but the flag with the erin harp
my live was a lie
Wait what
Really
Yeah, I know because ETA used that little island for contraband
Why was Sweden planning that
What was the potential gain
The city of Zamora in Spain has 61
000 inhabitants in 150km^2 and most of their streets are practically deserted in winter
Rovaniemi must be like a ghost town
The second name is still more tragic
>Later he got German citizenship, lost the Czechoslovak one and collaborated with Hitler to support his brand
That boat sunk fast
some of them where languages that where obsorbed by a mayor languages in the development of the kingdoms such as astur-leones ended been destroyed and integrated in castille
I know what you are referring to, there's some people like that for sure, but sometimes when I really don't understand what they are saying to me in Catalan they tend to believe that it's because I'm a bigot when in reality even if it's only a couple of letters it's difficult to understand, especially if it's spoken and not written since the pronunciation makes it harder
I know Galician and people sometimes really don't understand things when it varies less from Spanish than Catalan, I thought it was stupid too but then I realized it was easier for me because I was raised with it
If you know both Spanish and Catalan you might be able to understand something an Italian says because of the shared root, but not all of it
It's true that Spanish and Catalan are closer together, but that doesn't negate my argument
What I'm trying to say is, some people are idiots and do it on purpose, but Catalan is a different language, you can't expect people to understand you every time
Also, you are really really exaggerating by saying it's roughly half of the population
I learned about the color watching the EuroBasket
Just like as a kid learned Orange was for Netherlands in the World Cup
So that means the New Zealand is the lead producer of kiwis, interesting
I confirm
U think wales wins, 600 IS a lot of castles, and i say that coming from spain
We have a loooot of castles
well im from castille so i had any interest in learning catalan when i dont think of going there for non expecific reasons
LMAO this is like the tiny island denmark and canada fight for each few months haha
I guess the main difference is how you define cities
We wouldn't consider the houses scattered in the woods as part of the city
They would be part of other municipalities
Even "funnier" when you know that in 1942 Franco changed the time GMT+0 in Spain for GMT+1 to please Hitler
well the origin is a legend but they adopted the flag not so long after
Yeah, but strangely enough it's not that simple
Which time do you prefer better, winter time or summer time
Because winter IS standard time
Summer IS even more misaligned
I mean why cant we fight all war like this
Haha
it should be when it was french becouse fishing can be very regulated depending the autonomous goverment of the zone
well the military always love to do plans just for having them in case you need them
Is it just that
well its just 100 years later in documents so its not that long
i was expecting more 150 years
Yeah, it would be better, but
What about the memes
Haha
Seriously though imagine all world wars sending their best drinkers in a fight
The one that handles that better gets the land or whatever the f they are drinking for
No wars, no suffering, no pain no dramas, just a goos time like the one you're having for an island haha
No I was wondering whether Urge is just julmust marketed differently
Har aldrig haft den, ska prova köpa ett par flaskor från ICA nästa gång :)
Har du förslag på märken eller är de lika varandra
Jag ska kolla då :) Vilket är minst sött
Är spansk/egyptisk fast jag bor här och försöker träna min svenska så ofta jag kan hehe
[The 1 and 2 cent coins] were initially introduced to ensure that the transition to the euro was not used as an excuse by retailers to heavily round up prices
However, due to the cost of maintaining a circulation of low-value coins by business and the mints, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands round prices to the nearest five cents (Swedish rounding) if paying by cash, while producing only a handful of those coins for collectors, rather than general circulation
Despite this, the coins are still legal tender and produced outside these states, so if customers with one-cent coins minted elsewhere wish to pay with them, they may
The Nederlandse Bank calculated it would save $36 million a year by not using the smaller coins
Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to retailers' desire for €1
99 prices, which appear more attractive to the consumer than €2
00 (psychological pricing)
According to a Eurobarometer survey of EU citizens, 64% across the Eurozone want their removal with prices rounded; with over 70% in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia
Only Portugal and Latvia had a plurality in favour of retaining the coins (49% against removal, 45–46% in favour)
Source: Wikipedia
The argument for keeping them is to have exact prices, removing the possibility of sketchy rounding etc
What if we just express money in ⅒ increments so that prices would be like 3,2€ instead of 3,20€? That way there aren't any rounding issues and we can get rid of the 1, 2, and 5 cent coins
Psychological pricing strategy ;)
It depends heavily on the country
In Germany or Spain is less common than in Estonia or Finland
That term simply does not exist here
Nobody knows what they are, the only info we have about them comes from american tv shows or movies
We are not so widespread, but this comment and many below it are sorely misinformed
There are at least 500 active scouting groups in Spain, in several different organizations
We are much closer to the swiss/European model others have discussed, but because Spanish cities don't usually have widespread access to nature, we are quite limited in our ability to camp and do survival activities
In my experience we get around 6-7 trips to the countryside per year, including the 10-15 day summer camp
And yes, the public is extremely unaware of our existance, which is a pity, honestly
A random person in Spain can probably tell you more about American boy/girl scouts than about local scouts (which are always mixed)
Edit: If you're curious to see the distribution and density of scout groups, I found [this map] I'm not sure if it's comprehensive but I think it's interesting to see
Yes, I don't think something similar exists in Spain
One of my best friends was a Scout (first as a kid and later as a leader) and I know two other people that were scouts as well (not related to my friend)
I never was a Scout myself but my friend always talk good thinks about Scouts, and it seems is very similar to the other European Scout experience
A fun group for kids(boys and girls together), to encourage friendship, cooperation, and other good values
They have been traditionally confronted against Juniors group (not sure if is a thing outside Spain but they are definitely catholic related)
I can just tell them apart because scouts use to have a green scarf and juniors had it yellow)
Now I live in the UK and I have a Scout group in front of my home, and as far as I can tell they are as well a group of kids with mentors of 15-20 yo having fun, singing songs and wandering around
I'm 40+ now
I grew up in the city of València and I had plenty of friends in the Boy Scouts when I was a kid
Dunno if them don't exist anymore in Spain, but the term of course existed and wasn't really that rare a few decades ago
Wow, I didn't knew there are scouts in Spain
Where are you from
Is a common thing in your region
I live in Madrid and never heard anyone being a scout
Summer camps at most
I had no idea that scouts existed in Spain, I didn't even know they existed in Europe
I'm very surprised right now hahaha
I reckon there must be some of them, but I have never met anyone who is a scout
And if you ask someone in Spain whats a scout, they'll tell you thinhs about the ordinary amwrican movie scout
I reckon there must be some of them, but I have never met anyone who is a scout
And if you ask someone in Spain whats a scout, they'll tell you thinhs about the ordinary american movie scout
Well, what part of Spain are u from
Keep in mind that I live in a city, but the basque country has a lot of mountains and rural places to go
As an ex-scout for 15 years here I completely agree
They definitely exist and in certain places like Aragon and Valencia have reasonable public presence, but maybe still too little
Really
Well, Im basque, so that might be the reason I've never heard of such groups
Yes, a few groups exist, but as somebody said before, our groups here are really small and I didnt even know these groups existed in so many places
I thought that they only existed in the US, like collectingmedals and camping in the woods
I'm from andalusia, so probably up there you do have it easier finding a nice prairie, hahah
[20
000 Catalan scouts according to Wikipedia] For sure not as popular as the "esplais", but still
[Euskal Eskaut Gia Elkartea]
Apparently there's a [large tradition of scouts in the Basque Country] even if they're not that popular nowadays
Well, in countries with very few scouts (Spain for example) most young people only know about US scouts
Its a pity that they dont know where they came from
Well, I'm no scout, but it is indeed really easy to find a nice place to go hiking
Some remaining civil war bunkers, the Gorbea
Quite a nice place, although the times I have been on holiday I've gone to Huesca, near the Pyrenees
A ton of places to go and hike
My favorite one was a lake in the middle of a mountain
It was beautiful, and the water was nice
I even bathed in it
It was a glaciar lake, so it was clean water
Tha Basque Country is indeed a beautiful place
You have great cities, like Bilbao and San Sebastián, a ton of rural areas, mountains
It is a great place to do rural tourism or go to the beach
Oh, I didnt know
Guess youre right
Well, it makes sense given the amount of rural areas here
No, heat isnt the problem
You see a lot of people hiking near the pyrennees, near the border with France
I am from Spain and can assure you that most of the people here know what scouts are
I’m not saying they are massively popular but im sure a vast majority of us know they exist in Spain too
I personally know some people who were scouts when they were little
Well, most spanish people dont know a lot about foreign countries
Thats 1 reason for the low count of Spanish people in reddit
Add that to the fact that the English you're taught in school is pathetic
I am currently on level C1 in my English academy, and on school we've just began with B1
I think pretty much anyone you ask would say they have heard of it
Perhaps it’s not as popular as it is in other parts in Europe but I mean, it’s common knowledge
Are there any Roman ruins in your country
If so, are they well preserved
Italy or course has a lions share of ruins from the Roman era
Countries like Romania, Germany, Georgia, the U.K. and others that had parts of their territory under Roman control at some point must have some Roman sites as well, I’m assuming
Yes there are
Some are better preserved than others
A lot, for example: most of asfalt roads lie on top of roman roads
My city was founded by Romans
Country: Spain

I live there, in Alicante, Spain
[This song] by Radio Futura
It's extremely 80s and was like a meme with how popular it was
I'm not really ashamed because a lot of people liked it but listening to it at a party or something nowadays would be weird
It's about taking a girl out to dance but it turning into a really lame date where she pretty much uses the guy to get expensive food and drinks and doesn't pay much attention to him
The chorus is a bunch of metaphorical/hyperbolic rumors about the girl that they probably wish they'd taken seriously
I would never confess I enjoy any song from Camela but I know the lyrics of some songs from the beginning to the end
[Nunca debí enamorarme - Camela] or any other song by this duo
I'm particularly in love with this version feat Taburete
The typical songs that we all make fun of because is cheese and exaggerated, worthy of the best Turkish soap opera
but EVERYONE knows the lyrics and when you listen to them you're immediately transported back to your childhood, to your town's festivities, getting into the bumper cars or going all-out dancing with a few extra drinks at the carpa municipal
"Por qué te empeñas en seguir amandomeeeEEEEEEEEEE
I listen to this song on my way to work almost every day, and it was what made me start enjoying the proclaimers' music
so good
I just post practically the same  but about "nunca debí enamorarme"!  They re definitely our national guilty pleasure JAJA
Our cuisine \[Spain\] is awesome
&#x200B;
But I'd like to give a shoutout to Portuguese cuisine, which doesn't usually get as much publicity as Spanish, French or Italian, but it's just as a good
Chorizo is not an ingredient of Valencian paella
F**k you [Jaime Oliver]
100% of the people in my country agree that " all this was field before" (todo esto antes era campo)
That despite the bad economical and working situation, there’s no country that has a better quality of life than Spain
I don’t think anyone who has lived abroad wouldn’t agree on this
Spain: Rice with things isn’t Paella (This mainly apply to people from la ‘Comunitat Valenciana’)
Also about pineapple on pizza
Unas tapícas to buenas se follan a más de la mitad de la cocina europea
It isn't, but when you compare it to Italian or Spanish food
You don't need to be italian to find that disgusting
No offense
Ja, as a Spaniard I find this awful too, and I’m sure everyone in Spain would think the same :/ my German ex ate them with ketchup, disgusting
No, it’s good, find another thing
Un poco innecesaria la crudeza, pero sí, una de lmis cosas favoritas en mi ciudad es la feria de la tapa jajaja
Okay, you do you(?)
Italy and Spain shake their collective heads in dissapointment
I didn't even know that was a thing
I don't know man, chapata is pretty great
Still, that's only a fifth
Then you just hate the Spanish restaurants and hotels you visited
I totally get it, lots of them are tourist traps, next time check with locals first
Even Reddit is filled with people eager to help
Man you just ate at a couple bad places and think that Spanish cuisine in its whole it's horrible
I'm sure your country just like every country in the world has shit restaurants and tourist traps too
Oh ok
Lived in Dublin for a few months
I went lots of times to the same cafe, and chatted a little with the same waiter each time
Once I didn't have any cash so I paid by card
He asked for my ID and after reading it he said to me in spanish: "that last name has to be spaniard". He was from Spain too
So, it took more than a few minutes
But normally we spot the spaniard sooner
I can even recognize a Spaniard 5 meters away from me
It's like a super power
Hearing the voice, the accent, the way to interact is completely different, from others countries, so it's easy
Yes, I was in Venice and a couple came to me and asked in English if I could take a picture of them, I did and then when they thanked me and they were leaving I overheard them speaking my language
Another story, this one embarrasing to be honest
I had a German girlfriend for a while, we met here in Mallorca while she was on holidays and then I visited her and she introduced me to her family and friends
One night we were having a dinner with some friends and one of them asked me what I thought about germans tourists in Mallorca and I said well, germans get often drunk but at least they're civilized and they don't break urban furniture, jump over parked cars, jump off balconies, and get too crazy on the streets like brits do
He was british, I didn't know, holy fuck poor guy, I felt pretty bad, his first impression of me must have been awful xD
Ah oui oui mec
It would be diffcult for me to spot you as English, because they are usually very polite
Sure
But I suppose it was a funnier way to approach it :)
There are a few things that are written as they would be in Spanish, instead of how a native speaker would say them colloquially:
>I went lots of times
Colloquially one would say something like “I used to go to this cafe all the time” or “I used to frequent this cafe” or “I would normally go to this one cafe
” There’s quite a few different ways to say this
>chatted a little with the same waiter each time
“And would usually chat with this one waiter
>once I didn’t have any cash
“One time I didn’t have any cash” or some people would say “this one time
>he asked for my ID and after reading it
“He asked for my ID, and after looking at it
It’s worth noting that nothing here is incorrect, some of it just seems a bit more textbook than colloquial, but there are 1000 different ways to say or phrase everything
As u/odajoana pointed out, omitting the I that goes with “I lived” is technically not grammatically correct but a lot of people would say it without the I. Such as “went to the store the other day and bought a potato” or “was at work the other day and had to stay late” or “lived in Dublin for 3 years before moving to Paris
” Especially if you’re going on to tell a story which takes place in the setting discussed in the first sentence, saying it this way is not uncommon
All of what you all have noted is totally true, my English is not the best and I appreciate all of it as it is a way to improve !
Not in Spain
As in most places in Europe deliveries have to be made in person and signed (or, now that we avoid any contact, you need to give your name and ID number), they can't just be dropped in your door nilly-willy
If the package came through the public post and you're not home you will get a notification slip so you can pick it up from your nearest office
If it's a private shipping company you can ask for a new delivery, pick it up from their office or warehouse (edit: or a drop point in an associated store), or request to have it delivered to a neighbour or nearby business you trust
If you live in a big enough city there might be Amazon lockers or similar but those are far less common
I've just taken the Three Wise Men presents from my parents home's porch into it after three hours outside because it's starting to rain
Before the porch there's a fence, but the door is open and the house is in the main avenue of the town
We wouldn't trust doing this in a bigger city, though
Never seen that but on Reddit xD
Packages are given personally or, in case you are not at home, in the post office and you have to go get it
They never leave a package at your door
Well in Spain I used to not have problems but here in London and to be specific, Finsbury Park, package life expectancy is very short
The delivery service won’t care if it has to be signed
They will drop it there literally in the middle of the street

Most of the time they deliver a package and nobody is home they either deliver it to a oficial delivery point (usually an officially approved business) or in some cases even a neighbor
Luckily, so far we've never have had a package stolen, mostly because of that, and because we live in a 'closed' community of neighbors in a building of 10 residences
I live in a house in Spain
If I'm not home, they just drop the package over the fence
If they need my ID or name, they call me over the phone
I never had a package stolen anyway
Oh, sorry
I knew there was a willy there but I wasn't entirely sure where
It makes sense it's at the front
"They just drop the package over the fence"- that's the key point
Here houses have fences, the "front yards" aren't just open like in the US
She's the most accurate example to give to all those who nowadays believe that having a woman as PM will imply further women's empowerment
In fact, Thatcher's policies were quite the opposite to women's empowerment, especially for working class women
Where did I say all the power must be left to men
Because I can't find it
I just mentioned the fact that a women ruling a country doesn't necessarily mean any change for the better, especially if that women is hurtful to other women and cracks down on their rights
Next time read carefully and think twice before typing so that you don't come up with a fallacy as an answer
Albacete
We actually have a saying about it: Albacete, shit and leave
Puertollano
Andalucia has some of the most beautiful cities on Earth, and then there's Algeciras
Blandest: Madrid, most boring: Milan, soulless: London
*Note: I havent visited all that many
Also they have wonderful landmarks, just coexisting with less wondurful city spaces
I strongly agree
this was my first thought before I clicked on this thread
Britons and elders from the rest of Spain
Literally the worst place in all of Spain
I've heard good things about Montenegro though
What places are worth visiting, if not the capital
I've heard so many extremely opposite thoughts on Sofia and Bulgaria in general I'm confused
Well, MK hosts the longest (not largest) mall in Europe (and previously in the world)
Los yayos
Y Marina D'or qué
Marina D'Or es lo mismo pero algo menos masificado

Speaking of Serbia
How do you recommend Belgrade or Novi Sad for 3 weeks in January
Also how different is the country compared to the UE (I've never left the UE), in terms of safety, etc
Never got to see it open but probably you are right
Thank you so much
How's the nightlife
Does it have a young atmosphere
Are there frequent meetups
(travellers, expats, language exchange meetups
I will say the letter "ñ" in Spanish
It is not an "n" with an accent, but a letter for itself
It makes an huge difference:
- Tengo 20 años = I am 20 years old
- Tengo 20 anos = I have 20 anuses
As you see, there's a lot of difference
Another important thing in Spanish are accents (á, é, í, ó, ú, ü), they also change the meaning a lot in nouns
But as your post asks about letters, I will skip this part
Are the first two sentences pronounced any differently
Cuantos anos tienes
Me gusta el helado en cono - I like the ice cream over a cone
Me gusta el helado en coño - I like the ice cream over a pussy
N is not Ñ
Now that I count them, five
I went last year to Chernobyl and swam in a lake with dolphins of two heads
I think that has something to do
Wow
They are very similar
Moreso if we add the fact that the letter "ñ" was born as the abbreviation of "nn".
The same in Spanish, though with the accent pointing to the right
And "papa", besides the meaning of Pope, is also slang for potato in some places
I can't express with words how much I relate to this
Lol that must lead to some interesting conversations
The "~" was actually a small "n" that slowly got flattened over the centuries
You should know that there's an European order (I'm not sure if it's just an advice or a "law")  regarding the price of the ECTS (the European way of measuring hours of teaching)
It says that extra-European citizens (non-European in this case) are bound to pay the 100 % of the total prize of one ECTS, while a European are bound to pay quite less depending on the city
I know for sure that, in Spain, an extra-European student has to pay like x4 times more than an European one has to
Precisely, in France, some months ago there's been some controversy because "they should do the same" (according to some European institutions), but fortunately France is not doing it yet
You should look it up before make a decision, because the most of the European people are not aware of this
I know this because I used to work helping people to enroll in a Spanish university
Not free in Spain but pretty affordable
It goes from 800 euros in Andalusia, to 2000 a year in Catalonia
In Spain it can go from 600€ per year to like 2300€, but it tends to be in the 1000€-2000€ range
Also when you fail a class, it increases its cost substantially the following year (and it increases even more the third time you take it, to like over twice the original price)
In Spain in most regions it is usually 1200€ per year for Spaniards
Excluding accomodation, transportation, etc
Catalonia and Madrid are closer to 2000€ and Andalusia has a universal 700€ fee
But our salaries are similar to Portugal so there's that
I have been looking for this regulations in the universities in Andalusia, that I am more familiar with, and haven't found different tuition fees or any mention of price differences for non-Europeans
Maybe is just in Madrid or Cataluña?
Actually, I don’t know, since I think Andalousian universities are free for everyone now
But what I can say it’s the most of the time this fee for non-EU is likely hidden in order to get more people to apply for it
Coffee and pastries, at a coffee shop
Good wine and good cheese
Food, in general, is pretty cheap
And Spain, in general, is pretty cheap to live in (depending on the area, of course, I live in Catalonia)
Fresh fruits and vegetables (food overall is decently priced)
Whenever I leave Spain, I realize how cheap they are in here
Olive oil definitely
Probably fish as well
And vegetables
Coffee (about 1,20€ for a cup) . I ordered a cup of coffee in Paris and nearly had a stroke when I saw the bill
Alcohol and drugs
Fruit is very cheap especially in Andalucía as well as certain vegetables
We export a lot of produce to northern countries
I can buy a crate full of tomatoes in summer for like 4€ and freeze enough puré to last all year
Good olive oil, good ham, good wine
Payed 6€ for a coffee in Paris once
They are way cheaper in Spain (40-60 cents)
Probably the french ones are better
>Hence we host all your stag parties, where you barf and piss on our streets
Living in a town on the Spanish coast, this is pretty relatable
We definitely do
You're invited to come
It depends on what country you compare it with
Compared to Western Europe, it's probably cheaper (except Portugal, I think they have similar prices to us)
If you compare it with most Central/Eastern Europe, it certainly isn't.
> only place I have been able to find cheaper wine in regular supermarkets was Moldova
Wines can be very cheap in Spain supermarkets
Cheap wines range from 1 to 3 euros
Don Simon is usually around 1,50 in most supermarkets
But there are Don Simon "imitations" (wine in carton) that are sold with the supermarket label (dia, hacendado, alcampo, etc
) usually at 1$ and often cheaper than that
But wines in carton like that are mostly used for cooking (wine is used often in Spanish cooking)
It is rarely drunk alone xD
It is good for kalimotxo because Coke is stronger in flavour
But it is not even good for a basic "tinto de verano" with lemon soda xD
I like the sound when I’m in bed
yes a lot, best thing to fall asleep
There's a Spanish cheese called "queso de tetilla", which translates to "small tit cheese", as its shape resembles a breast
In Spanish it would be:
Hola, me llamo Juan
Un placer conocerte / Encantado de conocerte
¿De dónde eres
\- Hi, (I) call myself John
A pleasure know-you/ Charmed to know-you
¿Of where are (you)
Hola me llamo Juan, es un placer conocerte
¿De donde eres
Hello, I call myself John, its a pleasure to meet you
From where are you
Trying to keep the meaning of each word in both translations, the result is not that bad
>Hola, mi nombre es John/Juan, eso es un placer conocer tú. ¿Dónde eres tú de
>Hi, my name is John, that is a pleasure meet you
Where from are you
I also tried google translating each word and back
> Hola, mi nombre es Juan, eso es uno placer a reunirse tú. ¿Dónde son tú desde
> Hi, me name it is John, that it is one pleasure to get together you
Where they are you since
Hola, me llamo John, es un placer conocerte
De donde vienes
Hello, to me I call John, is a pleasure to meet you
From where you come
ARRIBA ESPAÑA!!!!
Up Spain
wouldn't the 'me llamo Juan' part translate directly as:
me I call John
Turkish can be hard with all the affixes, but it is a very regular language with no irregular verbs, so it has some easy parts
We have that in Spanish :P
Not really, the verb is llamarse, it's reflexive, so it's something I do on myself
Hmm, the problem is it's not a separate word, is a part of the verb marking it's reflexive aspect, so I translated it as 1 word, but I guess you could say it would be then "(I) myself call John"
Yeah that’s what I got from the topic which is why I posted my comment above
Brown bears, the Mediterranean/European Black Widow, scorpions and some venomous snakes, mostly vipers, can be extremely dangerous if you encounter them
But it's rare
Statistically, boars and wasps are probably more dangerous
Pedro Sánchez
Vipers, bears, wolves, boars
and maybe bugs that carry illnesses like ticks
How can the common snake be more dangerous than that tiger
Finally the comment I was expecting to come up
Appreciate
Okay, that sounds really funny
In Spain the PM works as the President in the US
(It's actually named President of Government, not prime minister but English media go after the British standards for naming)
Over him is the king, but obviously he is just a figurehead
In Spain our president is really more of a Prime Minister, but Franco called that position President and we still call it president for whatever reason
I never paid much attention to it
But in a daily basis you can always see the EU flag in public buildings along with the one of the country and of the Autonomous Community (in my case Andalusia)
There are also EU flags in some turnarounds
I'll not fly it above all because we Spaniards don't usually fly flags
You'll almost exclusively only see people flying Spanish flags in some houses/apartments when the national football team is going to play
Besides that, it's pretty rare
No not at all but to represent this better
I didnt knew that there was a europe day
Actually since last years it's been common to see Spanish (or Catalan) flags hanging from balconies but it's a sign for others, some Spanish people are worried about what it means and others are proud of it
In Spain it's, at least, controversial to fly a flag
I wouldn't fly a flag, I support Europe but I don't support what a flag means in Spain
I'm obliged to ask:
Why you Germans are the most "European nationalistic" of all Europe
Every German thing I see advertised always say "Made in Europe", "#1 in Europe", "European tech".
People in Spain use flags to attack other people
The Spanish flag for example, for some people, has negative connotations because they see it as a reminder of the dictatorship, and is employed by the right wing when they protest against things like abortion, LGTB rights, Catalonia
Nobody flew flags in Spain until 4 years ago or so
There was not a single flag on the streets / balconies until Catalans started hanging the flags of Catalan independence on their balconies as a mean to protest and show their pride
Those who were anti-independence took that as an offence and so they started hanging the Spanish flag in opposition, as if to saying "no, that is not going to happen, you are and will always be Spain". And that's how the Game of Flags started in Spain and now they're a very controversial issue
Flags have always been seen as an extreme nationalist symbol in Spain anyway, but in recent years it's gotten worse
Usually the Spanish flag is used by far right parties like a symbol against those who "lost" the Civil War
Today that flag doesn't represent all Spanish people
It's a shitty situation
My poor mother, who doesn't give a shit about politics, hung the Spanish flag on the door of her house when we won the World Cup in 2010
She loves to decorate the house for any occasion, no matter how insignificant it may be, and when your national team wins, it's normal to put up the damn flag
My father made a special stand for it because where they live it's usually windy, so she decided not to take it down (plus we had quite a few sporting successes at that time, which was her main reason for hanging the flag)
Now her house is "the house of the flag" and she has received more than one comment like "ah, that's your house
Why do you have that flag
Do you want to be called facha (fascist)
The flag is still there because she likes it, she doesn't want to waste the support my father gave her and she doesn't feel like giving in to anyone's pressures
She usually hangs other flags, but not the European flag because she doesn't know there is EU day lol
>she has received more than one comment like "ah, that's your house
Why  do you have that flag
Do you want to be called facha (fascist)
I'm from Madrid and if you ask that question to someone with the flag you'll get a very aggressive answer
Some time ago I tried to get a United Federation of Planets flag to hang from  my balcony but they were too expensive just to troll neighbors
A good one from this year: Mientras dure la guerra
(As long as this war continues)
It's about the life of Unamuno during the Civil War, including his famous speech to a bunch of fascists, when he was almost lynched and had to be saved by Franco's wife
It's basically about a conservative man who realizes that fascism is more dangerous than it seems
The speech makes the whole movie worth it, it's awesome
I think it's in wikiquote too
Here's the trailer:
- *Celda 211*. It's about a prison riot and it's brutal but amazing
- *Mar adentro*. Total drama
Based on a true story about euthanasia
- *Isla Mínima*. Basically Spanish True Detective
- *El laberinto del fauno* (Pan's Labyrinth)
You probably know this one already
- *Los santos inocentes*. Based on a novel
It's already 40 years old but it's great
Total drama too
La piel que habito - The skin i live in
"Ay Carmela" A tragic comedy about the civil war
The name is a famous antifascist song (watch the movie or not, but the song is great
Any Almodovar movie, but his best movies are probably "Volver" and "The Bad education".
Torrente
The 5 of them
Campeones
For spanish cinema, I would say:
-El Espíritu de la Colmena (Víctor Erice, 1973)
Unanimously best spanish film in history
-Arrebato (Iván Zulueta, 1979)
Highly recommended cult film
-Blancanieves (Pablo Berger, 2012)
Must-seen masterpiece of this century
-Magical Girl (Carlos Vermut, 2014)
Representative film of the new wave some spanish filmmakers have been exploring in the last decade
* Viridiana
* Blancanieves (2012)
* Quién te cantará
* Magical Girl
* Dolor y Gloria
* Pan's Labyrinth
Amazing movie
Great recommendation
My favorite movie
I watch it every year
So sad and wholesome
I would add Viridiana
A masterpiece of Buñuel criticizing naive Christian charity and in favour of progress
*Tesis* as well for a great thriller, although it's quite a hard watch
I remember watching *Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios*, but I don't remember if I liked it or not, but I do remember there were funny moments, and as we have recommended only dramas or thrillers, maybe this will do for something in the field of comedy, although having been nominated for an oscar many people will probably know about it
*AzulOscuroCasiNegro* is a bit more indie and modern, about a homosexual descovering his sexuality
*Balada triste de trompeta* is quite madness but incredibly good
However, without a doubt, the one I'd recommend the most, and fills the role of comedy, is *Amanece que no es poco*, which is an absurd comedy film about a litle agricultural town deep in Spain with very peculiar inhabitants
*Tarde para la vida* is great as well
Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso
Do you want to kill him
Whoever is reading this, Torrente is basically spanish shitposting
But watch it
I would reccomend you "Airbag", or any Álex De la Iglesia film ("El Día de la Bestia", "La Comunidad", "Balada Triste de Trompeta", "El Bar")
Another recent comedy I enjoyed a lot was "Abracadabra" by Pablo Berger
Spanish movies are all about drama
Your friends are summer children
We all should push the UK to help it literally leave europe if brexits succeeds
Vatican
US take out the aliens, we take out the predators
> Also European women raiding Mount Athos would be fun to watch
Yes please
Do they have a border guard or something
Somebody gotta steal the stolen water
There's a difference between a private propierty not open to the public and a whole peninsula
Angela, without a doubt, even if she is too conservative to me
Angela Merkel for sure
She could be more pro LGBT etc, but in terms of economics, she is doing a great work, we just need to see how well German economy is going
It doesn't matter what I choose because that leader would become corrupt after a while being around our parties
The person doesn't matter, it's the country that is completly rotten
I think anyone who isn't Orbán or the Polish PM (sorry, don't know the name) would be if not an upgrade, a sidegrade
And not just as an alternative to Sánchez, but to any of the leaders of the more prominent parties
They're all so bad
We in Spain trying to get rid of the monarchy while this fella wants to reinstitute it in Italy
Hey, the English are not going to lend their Queen to you, they are too in love with her, but you can take ours
> We don’t need more division in our society, it’s bad enough as it is
A little offtopic, but how's that
It seems pretty stable from the outside (especially when comparing to UK, the US and such)
I like Gezellig, that's a word that many languages lack, it's not exactly cozy
It's just Gezellig
From Spanish, I like the speed mostly, live in the UK and English is so slow
Also I'd say the huge variety of slang, British English is quite rich on that too
The speed and the thousands of slang words and ways of pronouncing words depending where you are from
The words/expressions we use to cuss, I just find them extremely funny
Ima add some history here
We have an equivalent to "asshole" which is *gilipollas*. That word contains our equivalent to "dick", *polla*. The word doesn't have a literal meaning regarding the dick, it's just the word
But AS IT TURNS OUT, it does mean something
In the 18th century there was a guy whose last name was Gil
He was a poor bourgueois and wanted to marry his two girls to the aristocracy
SO he dressed them up in beautiful dresses and taught them walking and manners, but the poor girls were so incredibly tight in these tiny dresses they couldn't even walk, so they walked in small steps and with stiff bodies, which people connected to how a chicken would walk
People just mocked Mr
Gil, he was a kinda ridiculous man and he spent loads of time showing off his poor kids in the rich neighborhood
Spanish for "chicken" is *pollo*, and it doesn't work in femenine (you get *polla*, which is "dick"), but people started to call his girls *pollas* as in female chickens
So when they saw them walking down the street, they said "Look, Mr
Gil and his dicks(pollas)", which translates to "El Sr
Gil y sus pollas". That got contracted until becoming the word *gilipollas
Massive use of subjunctive: Spanish has entered the chat
Real equality
Blood sausage (made with blood, rice, onion, leek and spices)
It's common in many countries I think but still considered disgusting by many tourists
In Spain we eat rice with sweet milk, it's like creamy we also add it cinammon or a biscuit
My family also love eating boiled snails with salt
In Galicia they eat any kind of sea food they are specially good at crustaceans like percebes, octopus, goose barnacles, lamprey in its blood, also in the north i think specially basques eat bby eels like if they were noodles
In the north of Castille we also eat blood sausages, fried hard bread, the bull tail, his testicles, ear pigs,tripe stew
In Catalonia they make calçots which is like grilled green onions or similar, i don't know which kind of vegetable it is really
I don't know were is from but my father loves pasta with squid ink and ink, i guess comes from Galicia because they also eat squid with ink
Bull tail, it's delicious but I understand the pro-animal arguments behind it
We have stew of tripes as well
We call tem *callos*, which is the same name we use for feet callus and that makes it even more disgusting
To give the whole thing more structure
Actually having tasted the riceless version (thos one was french) i preffer it with it
It is the filler
It gives structure to the sausage
There are some that are just onions or leek
it is for many people
I foind the broth of callos really good but I can't with the texture of teh callo itself
It's the one from Burgos that uses rice
Here in León we don't use rice in ours
Belgian food is good, tho
I'm studying in Burgos, here they have maybe the most famous morcilla ( the blood sausage), im not an exoert on it but i think they don't use any rice just blood, i ve heard in Leon they are traditionally made with rice so i guess we have many regional recipes
In my experience as a foreigner this feels true, and sadly most of this issues are a global trend
We've seen a demential increase in inequality as well, and the complete destruction of the labour movement and its accomplishments is going strong
París has more rainy days by far, I don't know if it is true but I heard that Disney didn't take it into account when deciding the location of disneyland in Europe and regretted it
Very common when written, but less common when talking
I mean, people use it, but "Vale" is still more prominent
Very common and widespread
Even my parents (in their fifties) and my college professors use it as a regular word
It's not common in speech, you'd normally use "vale" or "va", but it's not unheard of either
In written form it's a bit more common, often written as okay/okey/oki as "ok" is sometimes considered a bit curt, especially if written on it's own
Here in Spain is not  usually used in a normal conversation, we use "Vale" instead (it has more or less the same meaning)
However, a lot of people write "Ok" or "Okay" while texting
Very common
It’s usual to hear people saying “Ok” as “Vale” in Spanish, which means approval
Also at the beginning of a sentence: “Okay, voy a...”
I would say the opposite, it is used almost as much as the Spanish equivalent (vale)
Maybe the difference comes for our age-gap or less likely the place
I'm from Valencia (East Spain)
Ok can mean "bien" (good) when used as an adverb (*It was ok*), while ok as an interjection can mean "vale" (*Ok, I'll call you later*)
I buy that we use those expressions in a written way, but if I hear someone verbalizing oki, I denounce him to the Inquisition
Que cute ni que pollas xD
I was going to say that it is common to see it written (in messaging apps for example) but I think when we talk we keep using more the word "vale".
I'm from Madrid, nobody uses "ok", it'd sound ridiculous
I'd dare to say it's the standard reply when messaging, even for old people (60+ yo)
Well, here in valencia and murcia we do use it
I'm from Barcelona
"Ok" is everywhere, but when messaging it's like the default response
In spanish the same, "fin de semana"
I’d inform them that they’d have less than 20 years to sort their affairs and hightail it to LatAm, unless they want to die in war, or be executed
Kill the guy with the moustache
If the person was visiting from 1931, this is exactly what I would say as well
And while both of you are rightfully overwhelmed, a pissed man pukes in the background
And that will stay as it is now
So don't be moving the border during the night to reconquer it bit by bit again please
Shit, you got me with your over-complicated spelling
i would say that the history of Sweden or Portugal
I had always be amace that a country with that low population could form an empire that was that dangerous and had an active participation in important wars of Europe when almost all the countries around them wants to kill them (i identify with this one)
Also Portugal history seems pretty interesting, they where a countrie with one of the best navies and a good merchant structure that is often forgotten, also how they gain their independence from ""Spain"" multiple times
i talk abaut what we study, and honestly we study very litle abaut Portugal wich i think its a shame
and its a shame becouse specially that, becouse Portugal has many interesting things
That's certainly weird
well one of that we achieve it
almost 100 years so its not that bad
La Ciutat de las Arts y les Ciencies in Valencia has been used in multiple scifi tv shows and movies
The most recent one that I remember is the Season 3 of Westworld (it's the Delos HQ), the buildings were also used in Doctor Who, V, Tomorrowland, etc
Right now:
\- City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia
\- AZCA neighbourhood and CTBA in Madrid, looking forward to *Operación Chamartín* in the future
All three aligned to the main road of Madrid, the *Paseo de la Castellana*. Also, the [PAU de Carabanchel] features some interesting modern residential building designs
\- Distrito 22@ in Poble Nou neighbourhood, Barcelona
\- [Expo 92] in Seville
The finantial centers of madrid and barcelona probably
Although if i had to choose like one place it may be the ciudad de las artes y las ciencias (city of arts and sciences of valencia) because all tgose buildings are very futuristy looking
I'm pretty impressed by those pics
Definitely planning a trip to Hamburg as soon as this shitty health crisis ends
Also the buildings designed by Calatrava, like the [mall in Oviedo] or [the bridge in Bilbao] . They haven't aged well, though, as far as I know
That was going to be my reply too, although it is not a whole city, just a concrete place of a city
>La Ciutat de las Arts y les Ciencies in Valencia
That was what came first to mind but just to add some others:
Ciudad de la cultura in Santiago de Compostela
Centro cultural internacional Oscar niemeyer in Avilés
Correct me if I’m wrong, but in Azerbaijan I’m convinced it’s Qax
Both in Denmark and in Norway there are towns called "Å"
In the island of Lanzarote there is a small village called "Ye" and in Spain I don't think it gets any shorter than that
I've tried all the languages (speaking Catalan and Spanish) and I was surprised to be able to understand all of them
The most difficult was the Italian one, but because most of it was the argument of a DC comic book about "White Lantern" and it was very confusing at first
I could understand all of it anyway
Portuguese and French were also ok, one talking about an stadium, the other about a theater play
Finally, the Romanian one was surprisingly very easy to understand, at some points it felt like reading Catalan, it talked about some local movie called Felicia
Spaniard from Mallorca (I speak both Catalan and Spanish):
Romanian and French, I (think I) understand about 40-60% of the words, and it's enough to get the idea but I'm not sure if it means what I think it means
Italian and Portuguese, I understand about 70-80% of the words (maybe even more in Portuguese, like 85-95%) and I'm pretty confident in getting the overall meaning of the paragraph
Nice, all of you forgot about Galician
You are not invited for tea at my place anymore
*(Spaniard from Galicia)*
Spanish, Portuguese and French (I got an easy one) I understood all what was said
The French one I had to read it slowly
Then comes Catalan which I only ever hear and never read
It looks like a Spanish 7th grader's French homework that he did in 5 min
I understood everything but it took some re-read
Italian
I opened two and I could get the general idea but there where some words I couldn't figure out
Romanian
I understood nothing
I recognized some words but not enough to get the context of the paragraph without the photos and word in other languages of the article
My mother tongue is Spanish and I can understand Italian, Catalan and Portuguese, the French not
I only had problems with Romanian
Others I got 80-90% and deduced the rest by context
* French: could understand mostly everything
The article was about a scientist so a lot of similar words between both languages
* Italian: same
It was bout endometriosis so not a hard one
* Portuguese:  Lithuanian flag
Understod it easily
* Romanian: understood around 30-40%. It was about the Hubble telescope
* Catalan: 100% understood it
I'm not Catalonian but I'm kinda familiar with the language anyway
* Galician: Santiago de Compostela's cathedral, couldn't be more appropriate
100% understood it too
tl;dr: Understood easily most of them except for Romanian
&#x200B;
EDIT: I've studied three years of latin, three of French, and one of Italian
So that probably helped with it
I opened the Romanian article and could understand the basic outline of the article
It was about Anne Frank and a book containing her diary entries
The image portrayed an edition published in June 25th, I don't remember the year
Then it went on about dates and the content of the book, which is written in Portuguese (I think) and disserts about entries in Frank's diary
Pretty proud, Romanian is a cool language
Edit: misspelled language :(
Spaniard that moved to barcelona relatively recently here:
French: A musician, I can understand soooome things
It'd be an effort to make a word by word translation but I can understand the meaning of sentences
Italian: Another musician, I can pick out words here and there, but I have a harder time figuring out how whole sentences go
Portuguese: The easiest one by far, listening to protuguese speech still goes way past my head though
Romanian: The Y element in the periodic table, feels like half-way between french and italian to me
Catalan: A french town, I'd say easier than protuguese, although
I have been living in Barcelona for a couple months now
I intend to learn the language eventually but it's hard to balance learning Catalonian, then learning other more practical languages, studying for certifications in my career path, and actually working
Galician: Definitely also very close to spanish, if Catalan is half-way between Spanish and French, Galician is halfway between Spanish and Portuguese or so
The page is about a team of handball in Cantabria
&#x200B;
So honestly
If I were to order the languages by how easy they are to understand for me, I'd go Galician > Catalan > Portuguese > French > Romanian > Italian
FRENCH: Noah Bernardo Jr
Is the drummer from POD and second causin of the lead singer
He is also friends with the WWE super star Rey Mysterio
My wife is Chinese and her Spanish is not that great
We took a trip to Paris for a weekend and she was amazed that I could understand everything
I could understand basically all of them, it's weird, I don't know all the words but I still get the message and instead of reading it on that language badly, I just read it as if it was spanish on the go
Weird
I spent a fair amount of time clicking the "random page" until I got tired, I was on the page of some random skyscraper, so I went to the "skyscraper" page
Catalan: Perfectly understood, expected
French: 90% Understood
My French is very rusty and was never very good to begin with, but it's easier to understand written and I can geuss the meaning of many things due to context
Portuguese: Perfectly understood, expected
It's harder spoken, but written it's really similar to Spanish
Italian: I'd say 90% as well, but in general I understand much more Italian than French
Romanian: No clue
Maybe an isolated word
Latin: More or less 50%, I can reasonably understand what it's about
I'm from Galicia, so I understand perfectly Galician, Spanish and Portuguese
Catalan and Italian were easy to understand, but French
Of course, I can understand what it tries to say, but there are some words that are really different from other romance languages
Portuguese, Galician and Catalan: Very easy to understand, almost like reading Spanish with different spelling, especially for the first two
French: This one doesn't count since I learned it as a kid
Italian: I don't really understand the structure of individual phrases, but can sort of pick up the meaning of each one, so I get a general idea of what they mean through a couple of words of vocabulary
Romanian: it's a 50/50, I either understand the sentence rather well, or I would have understood it much better if it was in dutch lol
Half my family is Spanish and the other half is Italian/Canadian
One time my Zia Maria from Rome came to visit and her and my Spanish mother had full on conversations in their respective languages
With Spanish and Catalan, French must have been pretty easy
From what I understand Catalan is closer to French than Spanish
That's interesting, for me it's quite the contrary
I understand fine French, Italian or Portuguese but I have a very harsh time trying to make sense of Romanian
Maybe your knowledge of Catalan helps you more with that language
Argamasa means mortar and by extension a paste that glues two stones
I did the other way around
I understood about 50% but I had a difficult one about an oil company
I understood loose words, and knew the context but wasn't enough to understand it completely
Same happens to me with French
I guess the pronunciation of the two languages is too different
I find it funny how Spanish comes easily for most Romanians but Romanian seems hard for most Spanish speakers (except Catalonians, they find Romanian easy too)
Yes, knowing Catalan helps with French, but just with reading it, the French accent is too complex and different from the rest of the family, so it's almost impossible for me to really understand a conversation in French
Also Catalan helps with the understanding of the other romance languages too, for example it has a lot of common words with Italian that are not shared with Spanish, so at the end you can understand a little more of the text/conversation
Also as a side note (I'm not and expert) but I really think that Catalan is more similar than Italian than Spanish or French
I think that this morning I've been just lucky with the random entry, I've just tried it again now, and yeah, I can understand a lot of it, but this entry has a lot more of slavic words, and that's a no-no for me
LMAO probably opened Argamasilla, a small town south of Ciudad Real
>Gallego: a former province of portugal,
lmao
I always heard that Spanish was very easy to understand for Italians
Much easier than Italian for Spaniards
I wonder why it's like that
Anyway, in my own experience, I was always able to communicate with Italians both speaking our respective languages
I actually know a Romanian girl named after a character from a Telenovela
Never would have thought of that hahaha
"Baggins" is translated as "Bolsón" in Spanish, which means big bag
"Bag End" is translated as "Bolsón Cerrado", which means Closed bag
"Bard" is translated as "Bardo". Some of the hobbit surnames, the ones that refer to actual things are translated too: "Brandybuck" is translated as "Brandigamo".
The river Brandywine is called "Brandivino".
I actually prefer that they decided to translate all of these things, I think the way it's done mantains the feeling of familiarity and if they had keep the english ones it would have sound very foreign for the Shire, which it is a place that you are supposed to identify with
EDIT: Just adding another translation:
"Bywater", one of the villages near Hobbiton is translated as "Delagua".
Just to point out that Tolkien was a control freak and he personally supervised the translation to the names himself to Spanish, French and German, and probably some other languages
He wanted it that way because the names have some significance in being properly understood, and the characters are not speaking English to begin with in his fictional world
I'm not sure about this, La Comarca is the translation of The Shire
Hobbiton is just a village inside of the Shire
And in Spanish it is called Hobbiton aswell
I feel devastated
I visited Notre-Dame a year ago and I got so many beautiful memories from that
Notre-Dame is part of our global heritage
It's a tragedy for all of us
They might rebuild the damaged parts, but it's never gonna be the same thing
It can be rebuild, no one lost their lives, so it's not that bad
>	It’s actually forbidden in Germany to honk over inconveniences, it is strictly reserved for dangerous situations
Same in Spain
Nobody gives a fuck
I bet they also honked at you for taking roundabouts properly
That's cool
As Spanish I don't think that Madrid is particularly hated by Spanish people (Im Basque so I might be wrong)
With all the respect, british people have a lot of reasons to hate London
I don't blame them
I don't hear anyone hating on Madrid except maybe Barca fans (in a playful way)
Most people have visited Madrid before and I get the sense that it's generally liked
I think Lisboa is more hated than O Porto in portugal
Many Lithuanians told me that there's a bit of a battle between Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania
I don't think people dislike Barcelona besides the usual nationalist conflict
As some other pointed out, Madrid as a city gets a lot more hate
However, there is probably a greater (or at least louder ATM) degree of hate against anything Spanish nationalists perceive as "pro independent" or catalan - symbolic
So there is football hate, hate against the people, and even a hot hate for the language, shared among many of the regions in the Eastern part
I hope I helped you get a bit of a broader picture
Mmm
I would put the people of Madrid as right wingers
I would put Valencia but yeah
Might be
I mean, your ruler is the pope
The current one would be a benevolent dictator situation, so depending on how you view it, it might even be an improvement ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
Many people live in French towns near the Swiss border and comute to work in Switzerland
Swiss earnings with French expenses
In 2018, following the final verdict of the [Gürtel Case] which condemned the ruling People's Party to pay a fine for benefiting from the scheme, the opposing party PSOE registered a [vote of no confidence] in Congress
On the 1st of June 2018, the vote became the first successful one in the modern History of Spain, replacing the then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy with our current one, Pedro Sánchez
I wouldn't say quitting a month before elections is "collapse"
More like an electoral maneuver
I seriously doubt they would do that half term
In spain it happened in 2018 because the governing party was decleared a criminal organization by the judge bacause of corruption
Infamous suits better IMHO
Kids start learning English in school at 6-8 yo and stop at 16 or 18 yo, so it's kind of granted, but the level is quite low
Also, in regions with their own language (Galicia, Basque Country, Catalonia, Valencia, etc
) they also learn the regional language, so they have trilingual education
pretty impressive if you can speak english in spain
we are literally known for our terrible language skills
but the boomer generation was taught french in school so that’s still quite common
a lot of people speak french but no english because of this
Here we are still struggling to learn english
many have tried, but very few could use it on a fluid conversation
Nice-to-have asset that most people don't have
Although amongst people below 35 years old is kind of common to speak English (kind of common = 15-30% of the population)
Not really
It's more common for young people to speak English but it's not taken for granted
Some old people may speak a rusty French
I just wanted to confess that everytime I see a commenter with the UK flair I read it with The Closer Look's voice and accent and everything
same in spanish
They don't stop learning at 16-18 yo, at 16-18 yo it stops being mandatory to learn it, as you can change it for other classes, at least where I study
I'm sorry, pardon
WDYM italian people in rural zones barely speak Italian
I do get how, like in rural spanish zones, many will have a strong accent and will make common mistakes, which are due to poor/insufficient education
But even with that I wouldn't say they "can barely speak spanish" lmao
Yeah if you have an interest for English you'll probably find ways to continue your education, either through classes or consuming english/american media, but many people would just stop learning as soon as it stops being mandatory
yeah but only for a couple of years at a low level
We end mandatory education at 16, with a A2 level of English I believe, but if you wanna go to college you'll take another 2 years of education which grant you a B1
However, in practise most people will have trouble understanding spoken english, even if they speak slow and vocalize a lot
We'd have to take an extra interest and either have the money to take external classes or consume english/american media
My class did go to Ireland this one year, we were 16, and we were divided in groups of 2-3 to go live in a native family's house for the week
It was so bad
There were groups who didn't speak AT ALL with the family, apart from "Hi, thank you, good morning, I'm leaving". A friend of mine did ask the lady for a literal "DRYER MACHINE". She meant a hair dryer, the lady was so confused, and my friend ended up going to bed with her hair wet
Public education is still lagging in most aspect
yeah, they're excellent in getting people to science ans arts, but lacking in the matter of everyone knowing how to use a second language
The English level of most Spaniards is basically knowing a few words that they mash together with the typical structure of a Spanish sentence and pronounced exclusively with sounds found in Spanish plus one or two overly forced English consonants thrown in along the way
As you might imagine, going from 15 vowels and around 30 consonants to 5 vowels and under 20 consonants, knowing that only a small percentage of those phonemes are shared between both languages, does not work out very well
Same in Spanish: 'inglés macarrónico'.
Can confirm, the closest thing to a mandatory foreign language we get besides English is the option to learn French in highschool (at least in mine, but I think it was a trilingual school so
Same
Many old people in Spain spent decades working in France, like my own grandparents and some of my friends'. But I'm yet to meet someone who did so in Portugal
Funny how we're literally shoulder to shoulder and we have so little interaction
Where I study there are two types of class, bilingual and normal, in bilingual you have some classes like math in English and another class in French,like PE, if you are keep going to bilingual classes you will keep studying English
That's really interesting
I went to a pretty average high-school and we had the same situation
Same, never got the option to take Portuguese in highschool
Unless you're told to or given permission I'd say that'd be considered rude, yes
I like that the French have a culture of intellectualism
Be it philosophy or arts, I feel like the common French person is expected to have their own formed opinions about them, which creates a country where a higher form of discourse is possible
Portugal is so similar to my region of Spain (Galicia) and our languages have a common origin much closer than latin so we have a similar culture and can have conversation in our own native language
For France, its the food
a spaniard cant understand a portuguese therefore theres no mutual intelligibility and they are not the same language
Theres 89% lexical similarity between the two, but its probably around the same with Dutch & English
well i think most spanish cant really understand spoken portuguese at all
written down its much easier obviously
I'd say so, but i'd still consider a lot of the culture to be shared with Spain, specially when you visit other countries and see the huge culture difference compared to the "general" spanish culture
Probably
Obviously most of us feel closer to another spaniard than a brit or french, but some of us also feel closer to portugal than to Spain
Yes from the Galician Nationalist Bloc, but its really small right now
Peaked in the 90's
Either Albert Rivera or Inés Arrimadas
Everyone i know Hates them regardless of politics
The fucking thief we have for King
His father passed him the crown because of a corruption/love scandal and now during the pandemic there's been a shitstorm surrounding the family again
Those Bourbons never get sick of bankrupting Spain, so they must be kept out at all costs
Please NOT
NOT more politicians
our economy can no longer feed more parasites
You gave us the Boubons
It is already a tradition for you
Send them all here, then let me in and close the border forever
Aren't they just United Russia's puppet at this point
OK, but it has to be more than they embezzle
I mean, what's one more, right
Nononono, even for money, we can't accommodate any more politicians
I tell you a sad story: when I was in high school (14-15 years old) I had a teacher who was really worried about my classmates' lack of motivation to study
More or less half of my classmates aspired only to "work as a builder, you earn a lot of money and you don't have to study".Then, the crisis of 2008 came and the real estate bubble exploded
Do you know what all those useless bullies who just finished their compulsory education are working on now
THEY ARE POLITICIANS, everyone who hasn't found a job has joined a political party
(exaggerating in andalusian)
send help/hope/common sense/structural reform project of the economy
We already have our own Le Pens and Macrons
And we don't want more
Tye gender rule you mention is not applicable since I know
There are unisex names, for example Muriel
The Spanish rule that really friends my gears is one was dismissed a couple decades ago
No foreign names allowed
For example, I know a guy, English ascendants, is called Jon
Why
Jon is basque
John is foreigner thus forbidden
Ah, forget to mention guanche names, from canary islands
Anyone can tell me if chachiraxi is a male name or not
Chaxiraxi, Sibisse, Rayco, Xerach, Agoney
I live in Germany even tho I'm Spanish and became a father three months ago
I thought it would be cool to name my son after me (I'm named after my father too) so he would be "my name" III
Turns out it wasn't allowed so we gave him another name
Are Álex and Pau legally names
Pau is legal for a boy's name but I can image that you wouldn't be allowed to name a girl Pau and would have to go with Paula, same with Álex for both genders
Even though the administration may be lenient
I kinda like this naming rules it keeps the thing fairly simple and doesn't allow parents to experiment to much with a childs name
I would like to name my daughter “Drop table c_an_registro”
But I bet they won’t let me
Lol in the family of the boyfriend of my sister there are like 6 Jesus so no we dont have that here
(it seems like a tradition to them to call the first son Jesus dont ask me why)
Wait you're saying you can't name your kid after yourself
Yes, I registered my children in the Spanish consulate in San Francisco and they have to follow Spanish rules
So if I chose a ridiculous name for them in the USA, Spain would have made me choose a different one
Happily I knew and we chose normal names
In Spain, nowadays, you can name your child with foreign names, or even invented ones
But you must follow the rules
For example, Andrea is a girl's name in Spain and a boy's name in Italy
If Italian parents living in Spain want to register a baby boy name Andrea they will be asked to add another name to clarify it is a boy for example José Andrea
My father and his siblings have all three given names but all very Catholic and traditional ones so I guess that’s how they avoided the only two given names rule
If the actual surname is Messi, of course you can name your son Lionel
What you cannot do is to use Lionel Messi as given names: so not a chance to a see a Lionel Messi Pérez López or something like that
Pau, in Catalan, can be translated as Pablo (Paul) and Paz (Peace)
Both are very popular names in Spanish
Pau, for girls, is not short for Paula
I have always thought it is very creepy to name your child after their dead sibling
Yep, and as a teacher in the USA one thing that I hate the most is students getting angry because you misspell or mispronounce their names
Sorry, it's not my fault that there are 50 Kayla, Keily, Kaelya, Kaylea, Caitlyn, Caylin, variations
Yes, it is, it was explained on other comment, but the part I find interesting is that some are non gendered, and the others are unknown out of this specific region
But they are permitted in all the country, so it is possible to find a man called Chachiraxi (female name) in continental Spain because the officer didn't knew
Or a woman in Canary Island called Ganix, which is a basque male name
Also, Jose Maria is a male name and Maria Jose a female name
So Ganix Sibisse should be a male name, but Sibisse Ganix a female name
Who approves this
Who knows that
(One basque, one from canary islands)
My man
I know guys called Muriel
Myself am almost named Muriel, it is admitted as a male name
Or at least it was when I was born
Oooh no in chinese you have to carefully take into account the meaning of the characters
Very interesting
I meant if they are truly legal or if the administration just doesn't care
They not exclusive for one gender so they are technically against the law
try to explain to the police that it is your real name and that its pronunce Albin
Famous in 80s Spain too
Yep, English or creative names are very trashy in Spain
Wth
Obviously because Hebrew is as common in Catalunya as Cátala
I thought foreign names were not considered so they shouldn’t take it as foreign name when it means something in one of the two official languages
I'm sure most people from Spain will say [Museo del Prado] but to me it's either [Guggenheim Bilbao] or [MACBA (Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art) ]
I guess it depends on whetever you like more modern stuff or not
All of those are excellent however, very well maintained
I really enjoy modern art and the [Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía] (even better than MACBA, despite myself being from Barcelona and how stupid the Reina Sofía's name I think it is), but compared to Museo del Prado there's simply no competition
I would say no
However in my family we use English for that
I live in Madrid, so you might (maybe
) get more interesting answers from the bilingual regions of the country
I remember using it in Christmas when discussing about the presents
My stepfather used English and then french
I use english with my sister to prevent my mother from understanding
No we usually know more language than them but as a side note i dont speak french very well so my sister and mother that speaks french pretty well tend to speak in french in front of me to annoy me
Shit i need to recover my french lessons
It helps and we appreciate the effort even if it's very basic
I wouldn't mind at all
In fact I would be charmed, just try your best
That said among tourists, English (if they try to speak spanish) really do have a way of butchering our language
I think it's not their fault, their vowels just sound really strange in spanish and it translates into a very particular form of speech, which is hard to understand
Anyway it will always be seen as a plus, especially if we don't associate Spanish with your country
Oh, and if we talk too fast ask us to slow down, I wouldn't mind and it can really help
I feel good to see that someone wants to lear my language expecially if he/she its from our big brothers in the north
But you will also find people that will just make jokes on you and laugh on your face
All of u sound drunk af, except italians and Portuguese but the rest
My brother has been living in Norway for a couple of years and speaks Norwegian fluently
He gets so annoyed when Norwegians answer him in English because he looks "very Spaniard".
I'm always like 'moi, puhutko englanti
' Because even though 90% of the time they do, I'm used to moi-ying but don't want to jump from it straight to English
>where an old fellow demanded me to speak Catalan
Hahahahahaha
Not all Catalans are like that **AT ALL** you just found an idiot
You can find th anywhere
jajaja lol well the things there are special but i think that some people are nice to a broken spanish becouse we are know for our broken english
He uses it at work and has no problems, it is more when talking to strangers when he finds this problems
But I know there is no bad intention, but they just want to help him
Btw, Norway is such a cool country, and the few Norwegians I know are shy but lovely
50% of Catalans have Spanish as their native language
I don't want to get into a Discussion
You can check it in surveys made by Catalonia
Anyway, by this time almost everyone in Europe knows Catalan exists
>espanish
Accurate accent
>espanish
I see you're a man of culture
Probably so goes to show you how good my Finnish is
FML
Happy to hear
Well in spain there are diferent dialects and also you had to take into acount the american dialects so we are use to hear words that dont match with the rule in our zone
At least this is what i want to say
Nor good nor bad imo
I'm not arguing politics, I think you are
I brought to the table a fact backed by linguistics and estatistical surveys and you brought one backed by the constitution
The same one which considers valentian a language
and not a dialect of Catalan, against linguists consensus
As you can see I agree that Politics muddles the truth
However, my argument isn't political in the slightest, it's a number, and it's not a baseless afirmation
I'm not sure because it has been so many years
but IIRC the difficulty wasn't in not pronouncing "s" as "es", but to appreciate the difference in first place
Once you realise they're different sounds, if you keep saying "es" it's just due to laziness
No you are right
It is I who sucks
I'm not arguing
well, at least I'm trying not to
but you called my arguments baseless and political
I agree that Catalan is an official language of Catalonia as should everyone, because as you pointed out it is
it's also native to the region
And yeah, In that way it's native to catalonia
You're right
I just wanted to share a fact which I thought was relevant
Spanish is widespread in Catalonia even as a first tongue
As a Catalan has already said in this post: Catalan survival is in part dependant on non native speakers, which isn't a bad thing at all(We see this situation elsewhere, like in Belarus where the most spoken language is Russian, or Ireland where Irish is mostly and sadly an anecdote)
I think that's not the impression Catalonia gives the rest of the world, thus I wanted to share the number
It particularly struck me when I read about it
I though it was way more extended as a native tongue
But you're right this is getting a bit out of hand
I'll stop messaging, bye
According to Victoria Beckham, Spain smell like garlic
I don't think so
Victoria Beckham said Spain smells like garlic
Some people here didn't like what she said but I think they took it the wrong way since garlic smell is awesome
And ya, we have almost a bar per each 5 habitants so kinda makes sense
This makes me sad
Garlic smells amazing, I don’t see the problem
Garlic in olive oil, I'd choose this smell no matter what any random lady thinks of it
I would say holm oak, pine, ham and bread
Please, excuse my ignorance, I'm not trying to hurt any feelings
I knew some Germans who said kebab was from Germany, invented by Turkish inmigrants but they consider it German
I have always thought that it was from Turkey but I'm not really sure and they may be mistaken
I haven't been in Turkey yet to try your food that I've heard is amazing so I have little idea about kebabs in Turkey
B... But french fries are found all over the world
First time in London the airport smelled like hamburger in a really good way, I mean, I'm hungry just remembering it
Amazing and detailed explanation
Thank you very much
Siempre que vienen mis compañeros mexicanos a España, les invitan a toneladas de cerveza y hamburguesas pero me gustaría que les dieran jamón del bueno
El jamón bueno suele ser de entrante, sólo y acompañado con vino por ejemplo
También está bueno en pan tostado con aceite de oliva, un poco de ajo y tomate triturado
You just feel it in the villages
I'm from Aragon, one of the "oldest" regions in Spain, one of the "oldest" countries and you really see that even in the cities there are only old people
but if you hang out with your classmates and friends you might just don't realize
i live in a 20k town, the population is slowly decreasing year by year, young people flee to places with more opportunities, its all old people on the street (now not even that lol) and its a bit depressing
i saw some stat that thousands of villages were becoming unpopulated in Spain
I live in a region of Spain that has the same population density as Siberia, and we continue losing habitants
The government doesn't do anything and I'm sure my town will disapear in a hundred of years
The population is basically eldery people and studiants move to other cities to study at their universities, although we have one
On the good side, people from big cities come to our region to disconect with their busy lives and we have amazing natural monuments
I wish it was my case, at least we would have cheap houses, but in my case the town is getting bigger and more expensive while there is more competitivity to find jobs and the unemployment is raising now, with this crisis we will have 1 year with no jobs since we live off tourism so hopefully a lot of people will go back to their countries or native towns
I'll let you know when I can leave my house to see
Interesting
I get that you're talking about your town but France is one of the fastest growing countries in the EU, along with Ireland
Or any village in Spain
All the population is concentrated around Madrid, Barcelona, and the coast, where all the industry is
The middle of Spain is losing people (except Madrid)
I just realised now with the lockdown how many old people live in my neighbourhood
Before i saw more younger people because they were working, but now it's all old people + a few younger families
And my village only has retired people, and younger generations who go in the summer, but mainly old people
It shouldn't be legalized
Simply: it's a drug and I'm not in favor of drugs, any kind of them (medical issues apart)
I am totally in favour
Here, in Spain, almost everyone under 30 smokes weed or hash, be it daily or just at parties
We're also dealing with the mafia in Algeciras which has gotten a bit out of hand
On the economic side of it, I think we really need a new industry that can absorb the jobless farmers and give them a job
Also, our climate is perfect for cannabis and we could be one of the biggest producers in the world which would bring lots of money thanks to exports and taxation
I think there's way more positives to it than negatives and we could benefit from it more than we do from alcohol or tobacco anyway
Maybe we should ask why don't we prohibite tobacco and alcohol instead of legalizing more drugs
There are no soft drugs, all of them are dangerous and can destroy lives and community
EDIT: I expressed myself very badly
Check out below for an explanation (maybe you disagree anyways, but it is better explained)
Because those arguments are not really important
The only argument that should be of importance is personal freedom
Why the government should dictate what can I consume
There are more dangerous and harmful activities that are perfectly legal
As long as you're not harming others, you should be free even if you want to chop your leg
Why is pathetic
Why do you judge that people so harshly
Man, it's impossible to enjoy anything without someone else being annoyed by it when it has nothing to do with them
In order to not be an hypocrite, I imagine that you judge equally people on bars waiting in line to get a beer
I can be addictive, but in the same way of gambling or video games
Not like alcohol or heroine, which are physically very addictive, and if you're an addict you could die going suddenly sober
"Almost everyone", what a brave thought :D
I'd say that a good amount of people consume weed in Spain, it's very common, but not the norm
For me, the best argument for legalisation is personal freedom, I don't care about crime or economics, although those can be good points to convince the more backwards minds
Why should the government tell me what plant can I have or consume
At the very least, let me grow, carry or consume in peace
I'm not even asking for business selling it
Yes, and I wouldn't be bothered if it turns illegal too
Well, I said everyone under 30 has smoked at least once or if they are out, partying, and they get offered a joint, they usually take it
It's not even about personal freedom, I understand your point and I agree with it but it would be easier to convince those that are against by stating the economical benefits of its legalization
Medicines are not legal
The police didn't come to my house knocking to seize my lorazepan and I've never been searched and fined for carrying paracetamol
Guns are very dangerous and can be used to easily kill a large amount of people
But I'm all in favor for recreational use in safe environment as currently happens at least in my country
You can own a gun and use it on a shooting range, but licenses have strict requisites
I should be free to reasonably "harm myself" if that makes me happy
For example, eating in McDonalds every weekend
I'll happily pay my taxes to help others even if they have a bad diet or they want to drink alcohol
If I were such a cheap-ass should I be in favor of monitoring everything everyone does to make sure they don't take risk, so my taxes are lower
Should we ban football because here everybody plays it and it's a high injury activity
And we're not taking into account that very much like alcohol, cannabis can be consumed responsibly not making any long term harm with a moderate use
Which is how most people I know uses it
I remember thinking with like 10 years that portugal was just another region of spain
As a child I used to think that Germany and Italy were the same place, they're not even that close in name in spanish (Alemania and Italia)
As a child in the mid 90s I thought Baja California was part of the USA, Sinai was part of Israel, and Chechnya was an independent country
Also, every encyclopedia and dictionary in my parents house was bought in 1990 so it took a while to learn what the USSR was and that it was not around anymore
And regarding history, when I was a child the adults would talk all the time about "the war" meaning the civil war, but the movies would use "the war" to mean WW2, and nobody would explain anything
So I had a vague idea that there was one big ass European war in the early 20th century and that Spain was a combatant
When people talked about how Brits drive on the left I figured they drove primarily on the left side of the right lane, and didn't know why everybody made such a fuss about that
The idea of driving on the left lane was inconceivable to me
Also, I thought Charlemagne and Alexander the Great (Carlomagno and Alejandro Magno in Spanish) were the same person, and I was very confused as to why they changed the first part constantly
That's what right-wingers actually believe
Literally i was like "but why doesn't the weather man talks about pourtugal
Yeah, but I wasn't aware of that, to me Sinai just sounded like Biblical stuff and Israel did not register as a 'new' country
I found it more aesthetically pleasant
Baja in one side, Florida in the other
Besides, everytime something said America California would come next, so how could some part of California not be in the same country
The first time I saw a "disembodied" map of the US I was almost as disturbed as seeing an acquitance missing one arm
I first encountered the word Prussia in a childrens encyclopedia and instantly assumed it was a typo
Yes
Oh yeah, 3rd joke out of 4
Next is apache helicopter
Or "you criticise society yet you're part of it"?
Wait, is it "nazis were socialists, antifascists are fascist"?
The nationalism in Latin American schools is ridiculous
In the early Bruguera comics they used  to avoid references to the Spanish Civil War in order to prevent issues with the Francoist censorship
Whenever old people (like the "Abuelo Cebolleta") talked about *The War*, they used to talk specifically about distant wars, and the Franco-Prussian War was one of the favorites because it has nothing to do with the Civil War, but there is a *Franco* in the name
Of course, there are other references about Prussia in M&F, usually someone sitting on a Pickelhaube or stuff like that
Mister L. is the Superintendente Vicente, or el Súper
Bakterius is Profesor Bacterio and Ophelia is Ofelia haha
Tiffy I guess is Irma
The blonde super hot girl, right
That character is apocryphal, anyway
For some amount of time, Ibáñez wasn't the one doing the comics, Irma is a character from that time
But thanks to that the films had Irma
A small price to pay for salvation
Seville, Paris, Florence, Budapest, Istanbul
Here's an alternative:
Lisbon, London, Berlin, stockholm, St Petersburg
Another alternative:
Barcelona, Brussels, Rome, Viena, Krakow
And Another:
Madrid, Edinburgh, Napoli, Copenhagen, Prague
But really, the one that makes most sense to me IS:
London-paris-berlin-budapest-istanbul
All amazing cities i can Talk for and pretty much in a line
Feel free to change Budapest for vienna if you're feeling classy or prague if you want a fairytail (i just can't Talk for those because i haven't seen them
yet)
Lisbon-Seville (yeah seville is much more beautiful than barcelona or madrid)-paris- Rome- Amsterdam
Barcelona, Paris, Rome, Vienna and Athens
All of them are beautiful and have history
They all have airports, as far as I know, so traveling from one to the next would be easier
They're also all on the mainland, so with enough time, it would be possible to drive to each of them and see the countryside on the way
They tend to have good weather too
Anyway, there's a lot of cities in Europe that are just as good as those ones, so it's just my personal preference
Using just train literally removes from the equation south Europe and you would just visit the most homogeneous parts of Europe
I guess
Catunambú is my favorite
A lot of bars and cafes have it and it's by far the best of the commonly available coffees here
Their regular beans (not torrefacto) have a lovely light roast to them that gives a smooth and mild flavor and lots of oils
I describe it as kind of floral
It seems like dark roasts are all the rage lately, especially with the Starbucks coffees, but I really do prefer a medium-light roast
No burnt or bitter notes
Since it's roasted in Sevilla it's reasonably fresh when I buy whole beans which is a big plus
Not same-day but same-month
I used to live in Hawaii, where there are lots of small coffee farms growing some of the best, and also most expensive (Kona Coffee) in the world
It's a bit fruiter than your average coffee, but it's been years since I drank it so I'm struggling to remember all the details, other than that it was excellent
In my normal life, I go frequently to a little cafe in Madrid called [Mision Cafe] They serve [Hola Coffee] a small local roaster from Madrid
Spanish coffee is typically quite bitter, since they roast the beans with sugar - a byproduct of the days when coffee was in short supply, they used to cut it with extra sugar to increase the weight
I have tried a lot of high end cafes around Spain, Europe, and Australia (surprisingly snobby about their coffee) and this is on par with the best cafes I've found elsewhere, I'm sure it's due to both the skill of the baristas and the quality of the coffee
If you're ever in Madrid, give it a try
They also have the BEST napolitana (pan au chocolat) I've had anywhere on the planet
disclaimer: I don't work for them, just a fan ;)
Well I just broke with my French girlfriend
With the virus going on, we won't be able to see each other until the next year, so we decided to stop it
Dating someone from another country is a great experience
It's different and exotic
Even if you have the same things in common, the cultural factor means that it will be differences
Communication might be a problem
But it's part of the experience
You won't have trouble trying to explain something no matter how bad you are in the language you use
English is usually the way to go, but it has the feeling of whatever language the other person speaks
The words and the way of speaking use in his/her country will be translated in English making conversations very "colourful".
It doesn't feel the same as dating someone from your own country
And once you try, you won't want to go back
It's something that can't be explained easily as it has too many small details that make it special
I dated a german girl for 2 years
Sometimes I regret breaking up since it's the person I've connected more with but it was very complicated
First of all because when we were with her friends and family I wasn't able to interact because I didn't know German and I didnt' like that they felt forced to speak English, same happened with my family and friends, plus some of them aren't even fluent in English
We also had the problem of where to live, we visited each other, one month she'd come, one month I'd go to Germany, it was cheap with Ryanair but it didn't feel like a true relationship
Finally we broke up and I miss her sometimes but life is hard and full of obstacles, you have to keep moving
Sobremesa is a magical word that links family lunch with dinner
In Spanish year and anus are pronounced and written very similar, Año(Year) Ano(Anus) and to top if off natives don't really know how to pronounce the letter ñ, which makes for hilarious conversations "Yo tengo 20 anos" I have 20 anus
A teacher of mine once heard a British girl in a bar ordering an "ensalada de polla" When trying to say "ensalada de pollo" Which means chicken salad, instead she said something like "dick salad"
A friend of mine was learning Spanish (English Native), and whenever he messed up he would say “Estoy embarazado” meaning to say he was embarrassed
Not knowing of course that he was instead saying he was pregnant
When you try to say año (year), but because you can't find the Spanish n, you say ano (butthole)
Basically yeah
In Spanish (estás comiendo/comes) and French (tu est en train de manger/tu manges) as well
The most haunted place in Spain is a small town called Belchite
During the spanish civil war (1936-1939) there was a horrific battle in Belchite that destroyed most of the town, leaving only skeletons of the houses
It is said you can record cacophonies and hear voices at night
Oh and, while the ruins still remain, a huge part of the town was rebuilt and there's people who live there
There is a [really creepy palace] in the centre of Madrid that was built over the ruins of a burned convent and seems to be empty most of the time
Legend says every now and then you can hear inhuman screams if you get close enough
Nuevo Belchite is next to the ruins, tho
It wasn't rebuilt
The ruins were left by the Francoists as a remainder of the war
It's also said that Satanic groups go there to do their rituals as it's a place where many people died, but I doubt it since it's kinda touristy and rght next to the new houses of Nuevo Belchite
Wow, that's the shitties wiki article I've ever seen about something that's actually important lol
I didn't know that, but thanks for the info
Every place where a lot of people dies is considered haunted
I'm reading the comments and
I lived in the UK for two years and I was constantly saying "fuck" and "fucking", even at work and stuff
fuck
Don't you mean no one would give a fuck
In Spanish only vowels can form a single letter word
Consonants need a vowel, so only two letters at least if so
There are:
A (to)
Y/e (and)
O/u (or)
In Galician is mostly the same
Only vowels
A (the, to)
Á (to the)
E  ( and)
É (he is)
O (the)
Ó (to the)
U (where
usually used only as u-lo: where is)
a (to)
o,u (or)
y, e (and)
*a =* to
*e =* and (if the next word begins with hi- or i-)
y = and
*o* = or
*u* = or (if the next word begins with ho- or o-)
A (to), y (and), e (and when followed by a word starting with I), o (or), u (or when followed by a word starting with o)
y (and), a (to)
Yes
y, o, a.
Spanish is quite similar:
a - to
y - and
o - or (when the following word doesn't start by "o")
u - or (when the following word starts by "o")
FYI in spanish we say "es" (is) and "ellos" (the, plural masculine), so those doesn't count here
Cómo explicas "c mamo"?
You've got u, but you forgot e.
Hahaha, first time I see it
Mexican slang
Mostly as "q tal", and q is not a word
C mamo jjkajsjajja
In Spanish /e/ is like /y/ but when the next word starts with /i/, to avoid repeating the sound
So you would say "Pedro y Pablo", but "Pedro e Ignacio".
That means in Spanish every vowel *sound* can be a word just by itself
Pretty cool
Totally right
I'm ashamed I forgot it
Not i
I was sick some months ago xD
Maybe I was not paying attention xD
I meant counting "y" as "i". Focusing on the sound of the vowel
I personally don't see it as rude, but discussing salaries feels kinda intimate, like discussing your sex life or your relationship problems
So asking an acquantance detailed questions about money feels invasive (you can ask more open-ended questions if you are tactful)
My dad, my siblings and I discuss these issues quite openly (we have to be a bit more indirect with our mom though), and also with our friends
But a lot of people don't like discussing money
My parent's generation was all about "how can cousin Jorge afford that Mercedes
", you know, judging too much, and tended to be more private about their income and wealth
Younger people are generally a bit more open (among friends)
I'd say it depends on the situation
There's cases where you might talk about work and mentioning your wage makes sense
Mentioning out of nowhere *might* be considered rude, same for asking for it for no reason
And it goes without saying that bragging about your wage is pretty rude
People do not talk often about their wages, which I think is bad for workers
Knowing how much your colleagues or other people earn gives you the idea about how much should you earn, and if you are earning less than that, demanding it
This secretism makes employees earn less than they deserve
Completely agree with you
we produce lots of both
I'd say the standard are the green ones but then there are so many subdivisions and types I dont even know
I think people don't know olives are black or green depending on the moment they get picked from the trees and processed
olives get darker when they are riper so you get green olives if you pick them before they are ripe and black olives if you pick them when they are ripe
then they get even darker when they get processed
I only see black olives in pizza
Green olives are everywhere in Spain
As it's already been said, green olives are the most common here
However my favorite by far are some purple, reddish bitter olives
They are pickled, and are always made "crushing" them, they are cracked but still have the pit
I don't know their variety or even if they are common anywhere else, but they make me crazy
Since stuffed olives have also been discussed, a regional (i think) delicacy are "[kimbos] or "aceitunas follás" (fucked olives)
They are stuffed with a small pickle (the most common ones here, cornichons) and the flavors fit so well together
I love pickles and fermented foods, and olives are definitely a gateway
That's sounds interesting
Never thought about olives with almond
The two typical fillings here are anchovies and red or hot pepper
Not true
Black and green are almost equally popular
There are tons of varieties here in Spain with different flavours and you can get either color in any supermarket
Yes, they are actually the most common type of stuffed olives in Spain (and probably Portugal)
The flavour is not too strong though, it is a kinda marinated salty anchovie paste
It doesn't taste to raw or fresh fish
These are my favourite, I hate dealing with the olive's pit
And if it's with the pit I love the gordal variety, yum
Bilingualism is a common practice
Spain has several languages with legal and co-official status in specific communities:
* Basque, co-official in the Basque Country and northern Navarre
* Catalan, co-official in Catalonia and in the Balearic Islands
* Valencian (variety of Catalan), co-official in the Valencian Community
* Galician, co-official in Galicia
They are widespread enough to have daily newspapers and significant book publishing and media presence in those communities
In the cases of Catalan and Galician, they are the main languages used by the Catalan and Galician regional governments and local administrations
A number of citizens in these areas consider their regional language as their primary language and Spanish as secondary
In Spain there is a main language (Spanish) and then 3 other "big" languages (Catalan, Euskera, Galician) and a lot of not so spread languages
Everyone understand Spanish, 100%, but some have lost some fluency while speaking since they don't use it very often
In my case I learnt Catalan as my mother tongue and I started learning Spanish through TV, movies, music, etc
Then when you're 4 years old you start taking at least 4 hours a week of Spanish at school and at 8 years old you're fluent (mostly because of TV and movies, not gonna lie)
Nowadays Spanish is more used on the streets than when I was young, I was born in 1987 and NOBODY spoke Spanish on the streets back then when I was a kid, nowadays maybe 30% of the population speaks Spanish since we recieved a lot of inmigration from other countries that obviously learn Spanish instead of Catalan (and latin americans have it as their native language) and from the rest of Spain
in my region of spain most people are fluent in both languages we have, Galician and Spanish, but also because they are closely related
You also need galician for government positions in galicia, catalan for catalonya, basque in basque country
just a basic exam tho i think
In galician schools some teachers speak spanish and others galician
Education:
The galician and the castillian teachers have to speak those respective language in their classes, but outside of that its free choice for the teachers
I assume its the same way in basque country and catalonya
You start getting galician as soon as you get castillian classes at school
and everyone can understand each other fine speaking spanish throughout spain ofc, hell we can even have basic conversations with portuguese people if we ask them to slow down
(Spain)
For Spain it is kind of difficult to give a single answer
As others have pointed out some autonomous communities have their own official language alongside with Spanish
It is taught in school, and a basic knowledge of it is necessary for running for office or work as a public servant
Their actual use is a much more complicated matter
It depends on lots of things: roots (immigrant or not), who you use to hang out with, political affiliation, area, social position and many more that also can be specific to that region
My experience is limited to Navarra and Valencia, but I'll only talk about the latter since I don't speak Basque
Valencian is the name given to the Catalan dialects spoken there
There is a deep rooted and very complex identity conflict concerning this topic, so I won't make things worse, you can look it up
As for the use of the language, I would say its days are numbered
Yes, it is taught in schools, and required to access the regional administration
But unless you were born and raised in a Valencian-speaking family in a town were it is actively used by the majority, chances you will actually use it are slim
Valencia (city), which concentrates most of the population and economic development has been deprived of the language since the start of the 20th century, with this phenomenon intensifying drastically during the dictatorship(s), so immigrants from other parts of Spain didn't have any incentives to learn it or use it and elites abandoned it's use so the social role models were Spanish monolinguals
Most of Valencian spoken in the city is actually "reintroduced". Also many people complain that it is necessary to access public jobs (I mean, what did you expect), but the exam (I took it) is a total joke and many public servants rarely know how to speak it
Add to this the fact that during the first years of democracy valencians inherited a terrible division between full Catalan independence including Valencia as part the same nation (Fuster) or closeted fascist and other right wingers advocating for keeping Valencia free from anything that had something to do with Catalunya, but actually siding almost always with centralist spanish nationalist rhetoric and you've got the current situation
Only time will tell, but sadly I see it disappearing in a couple generations
It might not be the same but in Spain there are many secondary languages
Usually people can speak both of them or at least understand them
Spanish is more widespread in big cities while rural areas tend to use secondary languages as their main
In the case of Valencia, as I've already mentioned before, people switch constantly between Spanish and valencian
You might speak mainly Spanish with some friends while valencian with others
If someone talks to you in one language you reply with the same one
There are of course people that don't follow social etiquette and will only speak in the secondary language even if you don't understand it but thankfully they are a small minority
The chances of this happening increases in places like catalonia for example, where they use it much more and the language policy is stricter
In a nutshell Spanish is the language that people use for everything but secondary languages are more usen for socialising and interacting with the culture
Edit: We all start learning it at school
Some subjects are in the secondary language
Once you go further from primary education it starts decreasing as your studies improve
As the concepts you learn become more complex and specific subjects slowly focus on Spanish
Usually one year you might have one subject in valencian and the next year its in Spanish
The closest you are from finishing your studies the less valencian you will see until you will only learn it on one subject (which is valencian studies)
You can also do proficiency exams just like you do for any other language
Despite sounding quite useless as it is worthless once you move away from the region, it can give you an advantage if you want to work in the public sector
Isn't Balear a recognised variety of Catalan like Valencian
Kids do (because at school at least 30% of the hours are in those languages, and often more than 70% of the hours are in catalan where I live, so they have no choice), but adults don't, they just speak Spanish because it's enough
The use of the language outside of the school depends on the person, I had a colombian girlfriend 10 years ago, she moved to Spain when she was 13 and at 15 she spoke perfect catalan, no accent, just like a native, her brother, on the other hand, only 1 year older, and I've never seen him speaking Catalan, he understands the language but he doesn't use it
Of course each school/institution can choose how the language will be applied
Also Basque country and catalonia integrate the language more on the studies as they have stronger language policies
Studying on a public or private place also tends to affect, with public schools having more focus on the secondary language than private ones
I wrote based on my experience which might now be very accurate regarding other regions
Thanks for the insight
Any romance language is easier for me since for a lot of words I have 2 roots
Example: "To want" in Spanish is "querer", in Catalan "voler". I have both roots so when I read italian "volere" or in french "vouloir" I know the meaning of the word while another spaniard that only speaks Spanish would have troubles understanding it
It's not hard to read and understand the overall meaning of a text written in a romance language, listening and understanding what you hear is a complete different thing though
French is harder than Italian or Portuguese for me, but it's true that French has a lot more in common with Catalan than with Spanish
The problem with french is that it's not written as it sounds, and when they speak, they do it so fast, but if they speak slowly and clearly you can notice that catalan is very similar
They used to when I was a kid, but nowadays parents drive their kids even if they live in the same street where the school is
Stupid paranoia
Depends on the city and even the neighbourhood
I didn't take the metro to the city center alone until I was 15 myself, but I can see 12-13 year olds there alone too
Not any more
In the 90s, when I was a kid, we went everywhere alone from a very young age, even to the beach, which can be potentially dangerous
A few decades of famous cases of missing or murdered children have instilled in society a fear of leaving kids alone
Now it makes parents look irresponsible, in my opinion overprotecting our children is not good either and makes them spend more time at home because they can only go out when their parents or grandparents have time to go out with them
Spain: it obviously depends on where you live
I grew up in Madrid and started going to school on my own from 11-12 years old approx (1998-99)
It was either a 30min walk or a 15min bus ride
I could go down to the park and play around my neighbourhood without parents at 10 years old
However, whenever we visited the village my family are from, I could be out on my own from age 8 or so
Everybody knows you there, very little danger aside from cars, and there aren't that many as in the city
Spain has a lot of different contexts
But, I used to walk to the bus stop to wait to the school bus since I was 6 yo
Everyone did
Damn, I wish I had a helicopter parent
Not everywhere though
I think that's more or less limited to Catholic schools were parents live farther from the school and go to work to the area
Maybe some people do that but lots of children walk by themselves
>drive their kids even if they live in the same street where the school is
That only happens if they're going to work immediately after so they drope the kid in their way
I think in cities is normal once they are 12 or 13
In small villages they usually start way early
I agree
I went alone to the bus stop since I was 6, and I used to play alone with other kids in the street since I am
Always
Of course, adults was watching over us, but not necessarily all the parents at anytime
I don't think walking your small kid to school is overprotectiveness
Specially because of the traffic
Children are allowed to go around 10-11 years old and usually do it in groups
At least in my city
There are some schools near my college so I see them everyday
What I noticed is a trend of parents leaving their child by car before going to work or because they live a bit far away
They're very annoying and always end up creating a traffic jam of sorts around schools because they all have to leave the kid at the door like if they couldn't walk 2 minutes
This specially happens in private schools
Well, as a Spanish-Catalan speaker, I can understand only a few words in Latin (maybe up to 600-700
), and most words and sentences from Medieval Spanish (1200-1500)(sample text from [here]
Now, I've been looking for a few minutes for Arcaic Spanish (time is being debated, from 800-1000(?), to 1200) texts and I haven't found any sample text, sadly
I've read it's poorly documented, so that's not cool
The fact that I speak Catalan is important, because this language has been more traditional with Latin, compared to Spanish
Same with Spanish
Our languages are not THAT old, during the time of Al-Andalus they didn't even exist and they were actually born during the "Reconquista" from other languages that descended from Latin
In Spanish there are some that most of Spanish speakers do even when they are already quite fluent
Right off the bat, I can think of:
"People is" instead of "People are"
"Lose the train/bus" instead of "Miss the train/bus"
"Dream with" instead "Dream about"
"How is/are he/she/they" instead of "How he/she/they is/are"
I am sure there are others
We also make/do photos (*hacer fotos*), while you can take/get a photo too in Spanish (*sacar una foto*)
Same in spanish here it's "actualmente"
Yeah, I think we're on the same boat
Our word for it is *divertido* (*divertida* if it's a female word)
My teachers hated when we said "those are mineS" in Spanish you say esos son mios
Another one is the whole person vs people thing that  I still can't get right
Similar thing in Spanish, but slightly different
I used to make that same mistake quite often when I first started learning English, but I didn't quite understand why, since in Spanish we use a neutral possessive for both  "his/her" (su hermana, su hermano)
BUT when the subject or the complement are in plural, it is clearer: if the subject is plural, but the complement is singular, the possessive remains singular, whereas when the subject is singular and the complement is plural, the possessive becomes plural (sus), showing that the possessive does indeed need to agree with the complement, and not the subject
English has it backwards :p
It is even clearer when using "hers" and "his". In this case, it is obvious that what matters in Spanish is the complement
_Sacar una foto_ would translate directly as to take *out* a photo, wouldn’t it
The direct translation of the English _take_ a photo would be *tomar* una foto, which I have never heard
I'd say *sacar* is more like take out
I assume it comes from the old polaroid-like cameras
Would you consider the sentence "the police is trying to find the perpetrator" incorrect
Ok, thanks :)
Spending 40 minutes talking with someone in english online only to realize that he is spanish and never speak to him again
This happened about ten years ago when I was in Dublin visiting a friend for a week
My friend was working, so I took my time to explore the city on my own
It was lunch time one day, and I had eaten at typical Irish places the days before, so I decided to just go to an Italian restaurant for a change
I saw the waiter, and he looked like a freaking red haired Harry Potter with an Irish accent
While I was reading the menu, I noticed that all that the dish names were in Italian, and I contemplated three options to place my order:
* to use a Italian accent for the names of the dishes
* to guess how Irish people say the Italian dishes with the risk of ridicule
* to follow the usual Spanish pronunciation of Italian dishes and hope for the best
Finally, I decided to go for a (unintentionally bad) Italian pronunciation
After all, the waiter worked at an Italian restaurant and he should be able to understand me
I started to say what I wanted to order when the waiter interrupted me:
* *Espera, espera, espera
¿Eres español
* (wait, wait, wait
Are you Spanish
* Sí... ¿Tú también, no
(yes, you too, right
* *Sí, soy de Galicia, si quieres dime qué quieres en español y ya está* (Yes, I'm from Galicia, you can just tell me what you want in Spanish if you prefer)
He was very helpful and he didn't make me feel bad about my misunderstanding, in fact we both laughed
Why do foreigners like the macarena so much
That song hasn't been played in a Spanish party in several decades
It's like granny music here hahaha
>Give joy to your body Macarena
(meaning that she has to keep dancing gracefully, I guess)
>Your body is made to be given joy Macarena
(basically that she's hot)
>Give joy to your body Macarena
>Heeeeey Macarena Aha
I think that sums it up
If you want a full translation tell me
I'm bored and it's always good to practise translating texts
even if it's the Macarena
Yes, it's a mild sexual reference
I'd say al least 80% Spanish songs have mild indirect sexual references like that one, maybe more
Thanks, I'll do
Here we have a national ID and if you make your diligence it can work to make bureocracy online
[Here is a picture of the latest model]
Most curious thing is that i has the parents' names in the back
Yes, and it's pretty useful since you can travel wherever you want in Europe without anything else than your ID
It says your name, city of birth, day of birth, gender, address, signature, father and mother's name and your identification number
It looks like this:  [
In Spain we have a "DNI" (Documento Nacional de Identidad/ National Identity Document)
On it is the info of where on Spain were you born, your full name and birth date as well as a number followed by a letter which can be used to determine the veracity of the number
And Spain
I'm always a bit creeped out by how important your personal number is, yet it only has one random character
Like, if you upload a picture of your birthday, anyone instantly knows 95% of your personal number
Am I mistaken
Do people in Sweden worry about this
[Here is the non cropped version
So I don't know if the Canary Islands are just weird but I've never seen one of those, everyone just uses that big old green residencia paper
No, parents' names it's something that basically never appears on forms
The exceptions I know are the family booklet and your education booklets from primary and secondary education
That has to go with special discounts for travels of the islands
In Spain we must carry two surnames, one from the mother's family and one from the father's family
Cool
Thanks for the comprehensive answer
Not true, I'm in uni and I have to fill at least 2 forms with my parents' names per year
I guess it depends on which forms
I had never had to fill in my parent's names in any forms, let alone in university, where the forms I filled in had the regular stuff: name, surnames, full adress, DNI number, the usual things
IIRC: Seville, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid
As a trivia, Barcelona got a bigger population than Madrid in the 1930s.
For Spain It would be: Seville, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, Madrid and Madrid
In 1900 Barcelona had almost the same population as Madrid (and It would surpass It for a few years) and lisbon was just behind Seville in 1600 ( and would greatly surpass In following years until the independence of Portugal)
The rest were pretty clear cut
Madrid has been the biggest one for the longest time
Granada or Sevilla may have been bigger during the XIV-XV centuries
That looks like a tonguetwister
He, we also had Naples in the top ones
If we are including Lisbon we should probably check Naples, Milan, Ghent
as well
I thought it was Flensborg, are you sure
Yeah, naples would beat seville in the 1600 by a lot
Good point
I have no idea
DF had less than half million people in 1895
I wouldn't say I speak English well, but it's going to be easier if you watch and read content you like
Don't read and watch for the sake of reading and watching, you'll learn in the process
You're on the right path now, don't worry
I learned the basics at school, but 80% of my knowledge comes from watching subtitled shows and movies
At some point I realized I wasn't even reading the subtitles and was able to understand everything
I was sent to a bilingüal school since i was 3 and was mostly fluente by 6-7
To mantain certain level y stay on Reddit and try to watch shows in english
My school pushed languages hard so we started at 3 yr old
I started English lessons when I was eight, at school
When I was 17 and 18 years old I also had a secondary English subject called Practical English, which was focused on improving speaking, listening and conversational skills
In my third year at university I made a German erasmus friend who came to my class and we usually communicated in English with each other
I improved my reading and writing skills a lot since i use social media in English (mainly YouTube and Reddit)
Also through memes
I'm Spain it's possible as well, I think it's called the Seneca program so you can do both an Erasmus and a Seneca
It've only known people from Canary islands doing it to spend a year in the mainland though
That's because your uni puts English as the required language to apply instead of Greek and people think that they can expect English lectures
In Athens is the same
People could stop going, but I guess that Greece and Cyprus are still attractive in spring
I've never seen any option in Greece when I had to choose my destination, which personally is strange
I expected Greece to be a great place for Erasmus
Sure, but the thing is that most universities *require* you to have at least B1 of the language of teaching to even apply
Universities in Greece and Cyprus seem to have chosen not to require Greek in order to get more exchange students, which is fine as long as the student knows it and want that, as you said
I cant really tell italians or portuguese from average spaniards
I can kinda tell that if somebody is really pale they might be nordic or british or that if they are blonde they're prboably not from southern europe
It can be difficult but after living for some time in Poland I distinguish Polish features (eye shape, for example) quite easily
Surprisingly, yes
I think its really easy to spot people from countries such as Germany, the Uk, Belgium, Nt, and even some balcanic countries
Same goes for Spaniards in another country
Last time I visited Edinburgh castle the only thing I heard was a group of Spaniards yelling super loud
One of them was crying because reasons
I live in a tourist town
You can see the British and northern europeans from a mile away
With French, spanish and Italian i can't tell the difference
General idea: you can't. However there's cultural cues, do they have a deuter backpack
Do they wear sandals with socks
How do they sound
Do they move their hands a lot
How tall are they
There's not a simple rule, it comes from experience
There's so much appearance variation in many European country, you'd be lost without culture
For example, you may picture a spaniard as dark haired, dark eyed and short, but
it's not gonna work,  because we have plenty of blue eyed, blonde, tall gals and pals
Same goes with Italy and Portugal
Sometimes
It is mostly the combination of clothes, mannerisms and then looks, but it is mostly based around stereotypes
Some people already mentioned Dutch cause in average they are much taller in comparison to other countries
Some might say, they are preparing for the rising sea levels ;) French people tend to have in more often curly or wavy hair and have a pretty elegant style
In general I never try to assume
We use the same trick here, bonus points if they are heavily sunburned
Loud with dark hair, dark eyes and litre sized beer, those are spanish
Yeah the difficult part comes when you have to set them apart
Without language it's much trickier than one would think
> I cant really tell italians or portuguese from average spaniards
Came to say this
Of course this is a game I play when visiting other places, but Italians and Portuguese are indiscernible from the average Spaniard to me
They get me every time
Same with southern france
I feel attacked when it's said that Spaniards are loud but
it's just true
A look
An English friend once told me how easy is to spot the Spaniard in a pub
All you have to do is search for the loudest, fastest speaker of the room
Leonardo de Caprio has German roots and Austrian and Germans, depending on the region can have a very similar phenotype
But I think I know what you mean, a lot of Austrians have pretty full cheeks
In my experience Austrians are already a bit darker than Germans
Where I come from, few people have blond hair
For example my dad sometimes gets mistaken for a Croatian in the summer
Austria is a bit of a special case, cause we are a melting pot for a lot of different heritages
I think the most defined types come from the mountain valleys, which were pretty isolated for a long time
Reduce your meat consumption to a couple of times per week and use reusable containers and bags
Try to buy things that are made to last, and take good care of them
Don't buy things you don't need
Those are the basics, I think
Some of my favorites that may not have an exact equivalent:
- "A buenas horas, mangas verdes" literally "in good time, green sleeves".  It is used when something or someone arrives so late that it is no longer useful
It refers to the "police" of the 15th century, who dressed in green and used to arrive late (funny)
- "Poner una pica en Flandes", "to take a long spear to Flandes" (I don't know if that's the right name in Dutch),  is an expression used to indicate that something very complicated and expensive has been done and it is also a milestone
As you can imagine it has its origin in the war with the Netherlands, because sending the Tercios there was very expensive and difficult
It is used less and less, but this type of phrases with a historical background, I love it
My own favourite in Spanish: "nunca digas de este agua no beberé ni este cura no es mi padre", which translates as "never say from this water shan't I drink or this priest is not my father"
In Spain we have "matar moscas a cañonazos" (to kill flies with canon shots) that basically means that something is an overkill
I don't know if this one is already been said but there's this Spanish one that always amuses me:
"No tengo el chocho para farolillos"
Literally: 'My pussy isn't ready for little lanterns'
What it means is "I'm not in the mood for (your) bullshit"
In English Flanders
In Dutch Vlaanderen
In Spain, for heavy rains we say "caen chuzos de punta" (there are lances falling tip first")
In Spain it is similar: "Don't make a mountain out of a grain of sand"
We have hablando del rey de Roma (por la puerta asoma), talking about the king of rome (thought the door he comes) the last part isn't usually said as it isn't really necessary to understand it
Really
I've never heard of it
Where do you use it
I use "llueve a cántaros", which literally means "it rains like pitchers"
In Galicia we say it quite a lot
It also developed into the verb "chuzar". A chuzo was a short lance used in the navy, and in Madrid it was carried by the serenos
I've heard it plenty of times in Catalonia and València, although I doubt it's original from there
So cool
Maybe I'm too young to know, but at least I know what the serenos were
Maybe I'm just too young
The Royal Spanish Academy ( [RAE] ) is an organization composed of experts (academics, writters, journalists, scientists) that study how the language is actuakky being spoken
how real people speak it
There is one in every single spanish speaking country and they all come together as equals every few years and make the dictionary together
it is muuuuuch more democratic than oxford deciding they are the best at english and people saying "ok yeah I guess". That's why spanish is such a clean language, it gets updated every few years
In my country Galicia we have the [Real Academia Galega] :\^)
We have the Real Academia Española (Royal Spanish Academy) which is the institution that publishes the official dictionary
In my region we have the Ofizina de Lengua Aragonesa, which tries to ensure that the aragonese language (the romanic language closest to disappear, very similar to catalan) doesn't disappear
You manage just fine but tbh your spelling and pronuntiation rules could use some experts and solid rulings hahaha
Hahahahaha, exactly
>On a more practical level, who would do the ruling
Who is an expert
The academics are self apointed
The RAE is not controled by any gobernment
there are 54 academics and when one resigns or dies some names are brought up (scientists, writters, proffesors, etc) and they just vote
And nobody does the ruling of anything
They are just notaries of the language
they observe how the language is being spoken and written and change the rules based on how people are actually speaking
Their motto is "Cleans it fixes it and gives it splendor", it being the language
they remove hte useless shit and they implement the new shit
There's one of these in every single spanish speaking country and every few years they all come together and make the new version of the dictionary
it's far more democratic than just a bunch of universities deciding they are the best at english and people going "yeah ok i guess".
This system allows for a lot of dynamism and also keeps the language coherent for every speaker of it
a lawyer from buenos aires uses the same vocabulary as one from Barcelona
And at the same time, dialects are obviously respected
"Limpia, fija y da esplendor"
I think Covid19 is a disease, not a virus
Not French related but once a tourist told me very surprised that they didn’t know that Spanish was spoken in Europe
I know
Dos cerveceras por favor lets go Benidorm
What parts of Flanders have French speakers
Same in Spain, English speaking countries and culture are referred to as anglo-saxons for some reason
But wouldn't they be part of the Brussels-Capital region rather than Flanders
I'm very traditional when it comes to listening to music
I would usually put flamenco when I'm reading and sometimes I like to put "pasodoble" (the music they play during the corridas, interesting to hear)
I'm from Aragon and our traditional music is called "la Jota", I honestly don't like it but well
Spanish rock and punk scene was roaring throughout the 80s and 90s, and some are still around with some other newer ones
If you're into that kind of music take a look at some bands like Kortatu, Cicatriz, Eskorbuto, Barricada, Reincidentes, Commando 9mm, Vómito, RIP, Soziedad Alkoholika, Baron Rojo, Rosendo, MCD, La Polla Records, Ska-P, Arpaviejas, Segismundo Toxicómano, Animales Muertos, Non Servium, and many others are great
Rap is not my genre of choice most of the time but something like Violadores del Verso, it's pretty good imo
Of all traditional music to be found in Spain, Galician/Asturian is awesome, many styles are similar to what you encounter in Brittany for example but with different scales
We've got amazing interpreters of Medieval/Renaissance music
Check out Jordi Savall or Capella de Ministrers
Superb
Manuel de Falla, Amor Brujo ️ I love this guitar arrangement by Paco de Lucía
Rap scene from the 90's

A predictable one, but Madrid vs Barcelona for football and politics
Its almost a batle royale but with zones aliance
but for my city Valladolid our rivals would be Leon
that castilian independentist from the comunity
I am not Irish myself, but I know there's a rivalry between Dublin and Cork
Of course everyone knows that Cork is the real capital of Ireland
In my expierence the capital of Gran Canaria Island, Las Palmas, and the capital of Tenerife Island, Santa Cruz
Both cities also have support by the second largest in the other ones island, La Laguna in Tenerife supports the Las Palmas football team while Telde in Gran Canaria has many fans of 'Tete', the Tenerife team
I know they might be bigger rivalries but this one is the one I have seen closer, there's also Vigo vs Coruña or Vigo vs Pontevedra and of course Barcelona and Madrid
Also Zaragoza and Huesca, but they aren't that famous so I think this is just a thing in Aragon
honestly i always love to read something abaut Italy and say
dude, you could be talking abaut my country
Reading the rest of the post, it is clear that in Europe the excessive centralisation in national capitals is generating a wave of hatred towards them from the rest of the country, and for similar reasons
Food for thought
In Toy Story 3, Buzz Lightyear starts speaking Spanish
In the Spanish dub he speaks Spanish with Andalusian accent, which is a nice detail
Yes, for example, Sebastian ( the crab/lobster from the little mermaid) that originally has Jamaican accent, for our version his accent is Cuban
Not really, Castilian Spanish dubs tend to destroy all the accents of all movies, there's some exceptions but as a norm characters don't have accents
Sometimes if the character is obviously foreign they keep the typical french or russian accent, but that's it
In Spanish dubs, characters often lose their accents
It's one of the many reasons I'm not a fan of dubs
The Little Mermaid was Disney's last movie to be premiered in Spain without a Spanish dub
They made a Spanish dub years later and they kept Sebastian's Cuban accent
Do Shrek and Donkey have different accents in English
In the Spanish dub all characters have standard accents except the Puss in Boots, who in English has a Spanish accent as he was dubbed by Antonio Banderas (who is Spanish, even if this version of the Puss in Boots was inspired by El Zorro, who's a Mexican character but was played by Banderas) and in Spanish has a thick Andalusian accent (Banderas is Andalusian)
Really
I didn't know that, I always watched all anime in Catalan, and with the Catalan dubbing Kero sounds normal
The Catalan regional TV had tons and tons of anime back then
I'm so used to the Catalan dubs of old anime that I also can't stand the Spanish ones in general
I'm not used to them
Edit: I just watched the castilian dub of Kero, WTF hahaha
I've watched videos from Latin experts and they say the classical Latin in the show is actually pretty good for most of the actors
Yeah the Spanish sub for anime does some weird shit sometimes
If I recall correctly in One Piece, [Usop had his name changed to Usuff and was suposed to be Arabic]
We do
But I think it depends on your definition of dialect
I read someone on this post say that a dialect needs a different grammar and word spelling
If that's the case, then I wonder what grammar differences some of our dialects have
We have a lot of dialects in Spain alone but they're more regional than local with some exceptions like Andalusia
There isn't a single Andalusian accent and we can't even consider "Andalusian" a dialect itself but rather a group of them
In Central and Northern Spain the accent is basically the same (although people from other regions claim they can tell differences) but there are different expressions and names for the same things
In regions with their own languages, Spanish is very influenced by whatever dialect of the other language the person speak and by how much they're exposed to it (native speaker or learnt it at school)
I dunno, Spain differs between regions but there isn't much of a change from town to town, but britain does have a lot of variety with the local accents
In Spain there's a huge dialectal variety
I'm from Catalonia (where there are also many dialects) and I have problems when understanding people from Extremadura or Andalusia
In Spain it's practically that, especially in the towns and villages, everyone of them has at least one special word that none other use
In Spain the younger people use a lot of region-specific dialects of Spanish
Theres dialects of Spanish in andalucia, theres dialects in catalonya where they speak inadvertenly put catalan words when they speak spanish
same in galicia, where they dont have compound verbs so they never use them and also use some galician words in Spanish
Can Flemish people understand the Dutch from the Netherlands
I'd say Argentinian does have enough properties to be a dialect
Yes there are
Andalusia, Murcia, Extremadura or Canary Islands speak their own dialect
Golden rule:
If it has its own grammar -> it’s a language
If it doesn’t but it has differences -> it’s a dialect
Accents are part of what makes a regional dialect
There is no line separating the two
Grammatical, phonetical and ortographical traits are all part of dialectal variation
If that different accent is particular to you, it would be part of your idiolect
If it were a family thing, it would be part of the familect
If it is common among one group of people, not exclusively constrained geographically, it would be part of a sociolect
If your pronunciation is different than the standard dialect used in media, you are indeed speaking another dialect
Some dialects are closer together than others in the dialectal continuum, but that doesn't mean they are to be ignored or underclassified
Phonetic differences aren't any lesser than ortographic differences (they actually tend to arise much earlier and determine the latter)
It is very infrequent for a population to be segmented enough to develop a specific accent without also developing some other linguistic particularities, such as lexical differences or new grammar constructions
So I think your distinction is pretty moot
You are using a definition of dialect that is very withdrawn from what linguists actually define as dialects; there is no golden rule that says it isn't a dialect until the spelling is different or the grammar changes
Phonetic and lexical deviations are actually much more common than a change in formal grammar, and especially ortography, since these are often crystallized by institutional enforcement
No linguist would tell you to not pay attention to phonetic changes until they make their way to the written form
One of the first things you learn in linguistics is that the difference between accent/dialect/language is primarily political rather than linguistic
Depending on the grade of acceptance, the common understanding of the word accent/dialect, and the linguistical image that the ones in power want to present, variants are moved from one group to the other
There you have China calling their different languages dialects, unintelligible to a speaker of a different one, while in Spain Andalusian is considered a dialect even though the difference are mainly in phonetics and it is mostly intelligible by other speakers
This is one of those cases where the words has so vastly different meanings depending on where you were born, that trying to pinpoint exactly one definition for each of them is a waste of time
Mutual intelligibility is a feature people try to use to distinguish between [languages and dialects] (this video also has a segment on "accents vs dialects" so I recommend you check it out)
You are saying if there is enough mutual intelligibility they aren't dialects at all
The truth is, an accent is just an imprecise and biased way of talking about the most noticeable nonstandard features of dialects while ignoring their linguistic complexity
As I said before, it's unlikely that an accent will develop without some other particularities
African-American Vernacular English has entirely original grammar and spelling features, but people still call it "blaccent".
Not saying you are biased, of course
You didn't invent the word "accent". We're used to looking at the wealthy dialect and setting it as the standard, and looking at everything else as an oddity and sort of lesser
Linguists try to approach language objectively and just observe, that's why they don't try to distinguish between "true" dialects and "just accents". They analyse the differences, big or small, and describe them
The name they happen to give to these differences is dialectal variation
There are some things, like etymology, reconstruction and written records, that can tell us when languages were born, and what they were born out of
These can tell us Catalan sprouted independently out of Latin, so it's definitely its own language
Many other factors determine language status, mostly, politics
While what I just stated is incontrovertible fact, for decades Catalan, Galician, Euskera and others were outlawed and considered by virtually everyone to be illegitimate dialects, if not outright inventions
Asturleonese is a language from the north of Spain that has been suppressed and ignored to virtual extinction, and many people believe it to just be a dialect to this day, which thanks to factors mentioned above we know is not true
Moldavia insists on calling their language Moldavian instead of Romanian, Valencia calls their dialect of Catalan Valencian and considers it a different language
Czechia and Slovakia too, etc
There is a common saying that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy, i.e. institutional power often leaves actual languages unrecognized and recognizes things that are not really their own languages as such, for non-scientific reasons
There is no fine line between an accent and a dialect, and neither is there between a dialect and a language
[Check this out]
Yeah, that's totally legit
As I said, linguistics seeks to observe language, rather than to determine right and wrong ways to use it, so I'm not about to go and say there is only one true meaning to "dialect".
In this case, we're talking about a specialised meaning and a colloquial one
But they aren't neat categories, for example, I wonder if you would consider the Netherlands to have as many dialects as OP does in their assessment, given that grammar and spelling variations are not necessarily the most commmon in these regional varieties
I think OP was using "dialect" in a broader way that aligns closer with the scientific criteria than with your colloquial usage, but it was still in an informal, non-specialized context
In other words, the lines between "accents" "dialects" and "languages" are very fuzzy even in informal context
I try to pitch the scientific/linguistic criteria whenever possible because I think it's a healthier way of thinking about language
For example, in Spain people from wealthy central areas like Madrid and Castille claim to have "no accent" while Andalusians are stereotyped to have a single, very thick accent seen as "hickspeak" so to say (a feeling that is documented all the way back to the 1500s)
Andalusian Spanish is actually [very complex] each region has distinct phonetics with their own cultural connotations (morphological and grammatical ones as well)
Accents *do* tend to evolve beyond superficial phonetics, that's why I think making regional variants out to be just accents might make us complicit in the erasure and stigmatization of nonstandard speech, which is class politics rather than language
The "Spanish Flu" probably originated in France
Since Spain was not censoring their press, unlike France, United States, Germany or UK, there was plenty of news about the influenza
The other countries started calling Spanish Flu and hiding the effects on their own population
You know, to keep morale high while you are dying from dehydration and malnourishment
Spaniards are blamed for wars in America while in real life the american tribes hated each other and wanted to kill each other way before the spaniards arrived
Spaniards only helped one side or another
*Latin America*: it should rather be called  "Hispanic America", but because our beloved Frenchies, with the help of their jelous partners in crime, Anglos and Dutchies, that term became popular and the latter got replaced
The goal of this was to overshadow and belittle Spain's leading role in the colonization and development of the Americas
*Spain-owned overseas territories were like British colonies*: no, the various territories located in the Americas, Africa and East Asia were all fully integral parts of Spain at the time, much like Castile or Aragon were, and weren't aimed at land exploitation or trade solely, unlike Great Britain or the Netherlands did with theirs
*Spain's slavery policy*: Spain rarely, if ever, involved in African slave smuggling unlike the English, the Dutch and the Portuguese
The Spanish abuses on America
Spain was the first one into create laws for native Americans protection, native slavery was banned, just black slaves were allowed, they had the same rights as a Spanish from Spain
Colombus went to jail for his brutal abuses
Spaniards created hospitals and collages in America for natives and mestizos
Yes, they used to don't care a lot about it, yes it wasn't exactly the same to live in Spain than in America but at least we weren't Brits French or Belgians and did genocidio
Please, Cortes conquered the Incan empire with just 300man
Also the inquisicion killed less people in Spain than the inquisiton on Germany France or England that also existed
Also the Americans blame us for kill all the Indians for California,  pretty ironic
Also, the Inquisition, another French invention
Damn it, France
What have we done to you
I don't think Spaniards think in Belgium when they mention Brussels and the EU
I think there are even Spaniards that don't know in which country is Brussels
The so known Black Legend, my friend
The jealous betraying merciless pirates (English and Dutchies mainly) have always been trying to belittle Spain in every aspect; its work in the Americas, its leading role there and in fields like the arts, alchemy, seafaring, astronomy, etc
at the time which were all crucial for human progress and without which modern science wouldn't be the same, etc
Also, as much as these pricks deny it, the Catholic Church did play a vital role in the colonization of the Americas as well as in its societal development (literacy of native population, creation for the first time of a proper grammar for Native-American languages and codification of those into the Latin alphabet
So yeah, definitely Spain isn't as bad as Hollywood and their Globalist Anglo friends make it to be
Brussels has become a synonim for EU
But we don't blame you
I believe England was way more "persuasive"... You can't even compare the extermination of north american natives and latin american native
And the only proof needed is the color of the skin, the facial features of the average north american (pure european until 50 years ago when they started to recieve inmigration from latam) and the average latinamerican, mixed and with a lot of american natives
Yeah I know, but a lot of people blames spaniards too and also the films does about the Spaniards and never about English French, etc
Yeah, Spanish empire is viewed as a brutal and dumb bunch of people, yeah I know what the Black legend is, but we can't fall in the white legend, that also exists
Well I doubt there are other countries out there with 'Galician language and literature' as a compulsory subject in some high schools
Alternative to religion (Alternativa a la religión)
I have friends from other countries in Europe that did have a Religion subject and, for those who don't want to take it, there are others to choose and some of them are interesting
In Spain we had this subject where we did literally nothing: no books, no exams, no homework, no content
Just spend an hour doing whatever you want while the teacher reads the newspaper
We do it in Spain
In the humanities path you have "history of art" as an optative subject, my brother did it
And in the tecnological path you do technical drawing too
We have them both, but arranged differently, in fact, just yesterday I had a dibujo técnico exam
In Spain Latin and Greek are taught in the bachillerato de humanidades (one of the 5 paths you can choose for 16-18 years)
In Spain we have Latin in Humanities (High school) and you can choose greek too
I did Latin and honestly it's very useful when learning other romance languages
What kind of projects and experiences
Sounds very cool, wish we had had such a subject
Instead, our final year trip (4 days to Paris) got cancelled becase most teachers didn’t want to go without being paid for the whole hours and not only 8 xdddd
I have some better subjects:
* 7th grade: "Interdisciplinary Proyect". It was such a filler, we mostly read studying guides and/or did other subjects homeworks
* 8th grade: "Education for the citizens"(? "Educación para la ciudadanía")
About human rights, feminism, ecology, laws, etc
* 11th grade: "Science for the Contemporary World". A little bit of general science
Iirc we had a lot of food related classes, to eat better, try to be healthier and "greener" in general
This was like 10 years ago
If you change it to catalan or Basque literature it's the same
But it's an optative subject in the humanities path in Catalonia . I took it
God this is so accurate
I was in alternative to religion as well and we didn't even have a teacher, we were free to do anything
Oh, when I was in high school it was mandatory for humanities (and easily the most time-consuming subject) and optional for arts
Same in Spain
My mother had mandatory sewing classes
At Science for the Contemporary World, we mostly did  Physics about the Universe
the teacher was our Physics teacher and very freak about the Universe so
I guess every teacher chose what to do in that shitty subject
I had almost forgotten it
Is it optative in high school
I thought these kind of subjects were always obligatory in their own regions
Maybe in the prior education system
My brother did  the old bachiller but I was one of the first doing the LOMCE
Spain is famous for changing the education system every few years :/
Yes
I'm pretty sure there aren't on the program anymore and maybe it was an Autonomy thing
I had a Bio teacher
I got lucky because my class was 95% humanities and socials plus me and my two buddies that did technology so the teacher was chill because most of the classroom hadn't had any science in some time
Yes, it is
You have catalan as a language subject just like Spanish or English but the catalan literature is an optative subject
Maybe
It might also depend on the autonomous community
I did it in Castilla La-Mancha but it might be different in Madrid or Andalucia
For us it was this subject for which you don’t really study and get a 10 (of course, if you are to some point interested in Science and have at least some brain cells xD)
It was multiple choice and very essy
Ooh that's sad :( we have language and literature inside the same subject
Well, I studied in Catalonia but I think subjects aren't changed
Are you older than 38
That's around when they changed the older education plan
This was more recent
Iirc 7th grade was 2011
Why
I don't think that's sad actually you can focus more on the subject, it's more specific, if you're keen on it because that's all you'll do the whole year
nah I'm 28
I did the last year the LOE (I think it was the last year at least) was active
Idk I think you can understand better a language through its literature as well
And it's never a bad thing to learn the culture around you
Then it's the education plan after mine
Yes but If you do 2 subjects in one you won't go as deep on both subjects as you would if you devide them
Edit: Spain
The closest thing we have to that is Irun/Hendaia (Basque Country)
Also Vilar formoso (Portugal) and Línea de la Concepción/Gibraltar (UK) might be some examples
But nothing quite like some Benelux cities
Le Perthus is a little Catalan mountain town divided between France and Spain after the Spanish kings ceded the parts of Catalonia north of the Pyrenees in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659
The main street serves as the "physical" border
Dantxarinea (Spain) and Dancharia (France) is a small village in the Navarrese border so I guess that it was divided as a result of the division of the former kingdom of Navarre between France and Spain in the 16th century
There are no more divided towns that I know of
Borders between Portugal and, subsequently, the kingdom of León, the Crown of Castile and Spain have barely changed and if they have (like Olivenza/Olivença) they were redone taking towns into account
The same thing goes for the majority of towns in the border with France
What is very common is "sister" towns appearing is strategic parts of the borders like La Línea next to Gibraltar, or towns separated by a river that became a border like Hendaya and Irun or Tuy and Valença.
Not that many
at least that I know of
Being a peninsula we don't really share that much border like in mainland Europe, so there's only two borderes where "border towns" could happen: France and Portugal
Geography makes it harder for the first case, but after a quick look at the map there seem to be a couple of very small merged villages in the Pyrenees
Irún/Hendaya in the Basque Country could be considered the same town, only separated by a small river
In the case of Portugal geography wouldn't be a problem, however, there really isn't that many border towns
I only found a few small villages on the map
There's also the border with Morocco with our cities Ceuta and Melilla but they're not border towns with any Moroccan counterpart
Yeah theres a few in the Spain-France border
I've been in the basque one
Jeeze
imagine living in that town before the EU/Schengen Area
I assume they had some sort of special immigration considerations
In a trip before the corona I crossed from Slovenia to Italy through Gorizia in bus and there was a super long police check
We were stopped for like 45 minutes, which sucked
Is that normal
What's the deal
I didn't expect such a control whithin the EU
Yeah I didn't notice crossing the border
The stop was a regular city stop to pick/drop people up/off at the bus station/stop, but there was a Carabinieri car which ran that long, annoying passport/ID check
Actually I luckily cut it close but the panic didn't start yet
It was only a few days after that, just when I got back home, that the panic started when the outbreak was reported in Northern Italy
Btw how are you guys holding out in Slovenia
I was in Ljubljana and Bled
Total lockdown
Yeah what's the deal with the red water
Is it boat oil
Algae
He is respected as one of the strongest and most influential figures in the history of Europe
At the same time, he betrayed us and invaded us (along with many other places), and he turned his own country into a despotic regime again
So he's seen as an ambitious and ruthless ruler, as are many other historic strongmen
In Spain he’s seen as a person who was a great military leader and he organized a good state in France, however, he’s also seen as a despotic madman who conquered, pillaged, raped, and anihilated his way through Europe, especially Spain, where he’s remembered as the person who the brave civilians fought back against for our independence and made us create modern guerrilla warfare to fight his troops and the Mamelukes
Thanks to him, or thanks to the hatred we had to him we developed our first liberal constitution and we were first really united us as a nation
Nothing about The slavery
I read sometimes Ago that after you got the independence from Spain and the USA was the new "owner" your president came to the funeral of the spanish King and told that he regreted to support the independence because the americans betrayed you and Spain didnt
I don't know a lot
You were a colony and then you got independence in the late 1800's. I reckon we killed a lot of people in your country
I do know that the British came afterwards, and purged Spanish speakers, but only because I was curious about the relatively low numbers of Spanish speakers given the colonial past, and did some research
Can confirm
I know we were at war with "Flandes" and it was our territory before but I had no idea it was so important for y'all
Nah, the eastern front is where it really was at, the western front was a gentlemen Battle, you won that shit not the english or the USA
Yeah, in Spain he's a complex figure
On one hand he betrayed us and ruthlesly conquered us
But on the other, he exiled arguably the worst king in our history, and the independence war against France gave us our first constitution and reinforced the sense of national identity (at least in Madrid, where Independence war stuff is everywhere)
Spain accepted it and it didnt go well for them neither napoleon
The average Spaniard's knowledge about the Philippines is "oh yeah ,we had that too".
Yeah, and it started a civil war in Spain , so so
I've always felt a sort of pity for him because of the end of his life story
Exiled to an island, manages to return, garner troop support out of sheer popularity and seize power for 100 days, and then exiled to an island much further away until he died
Such a humiliating end for a once mighty emperor
I have a strong sense of admiration for him
Sometimes I think what Spain would be like had we not won against France
Sure, no independence, but no Fernando VII or Isabel II either, possibly not Carlist wars
who knows, it's fun to imagine
It would be interesting if you try some of the romance languages like French or Spanish, since English is a german language but with a lot of romance vocabulary
French: [French]
Spanish: [Spanish]
Yes
Any sweatpants, and old, baggy clothes from before I lost a weight
Same
We don't have a song, but we have a saying, that It says: "Todo buen Español debe mear mirando hacia Inglaterra", which translates to: "Every good Spaniard has to piss watching to England". It's a very old saying that originated when we were always fighting eachother
Sorry but what is that because most people don't understand
I mean, your anthem is literally a military marching song about fighting invaders
OMG I've been waiting for this all my life
HOI4: I like to play as a Spain for quite obvious reasons, win the civil war and then join maybe the allies, the axis or the commies, and try to hold against the others until american reinforcements arrive, try it as a challenge, it's fun (if I'm inspired I also go for the Mercadona anarchism world conquest thanks to the best mod ever created)
Also, as a tip (please dont get mad boys
NO NOT OLIVENÇA AGAIN PLS) the first thing I do as soon as I finish the civil war is annex Portugal
Spain early sucks and those factories, territory and overseas are basically free and really useful
I also like playing with France, the Uk, Italy, Greece and for some weird reason almost all Balkan countries
As for other games, I also like CK2-3
Again, my main is Spain, but this time is not for obvious reasons, but because they have one of the funniest games
Just try Urraca and fuck and assassinate your way to all three kingdoms, and then try to win the reconquista
The HRM and biz is cool to play with
I haven't done a lot of runs yet in CK (II and III) and EUIV, but I went for Spain in my first games and it's really fun
In Crusader Kings I usually go for the Kingdom of Galicia in 1066 because that's where I'm from and it's a fun game to struggle against your brothers of Castille and Leon while trying to get as much territory as possible in the Reconquista ASAP so you can overpower them or plot against them so you can inherit or even conquer their Kingdoms
I've also played a couple games with vikings and I obviously started my first games in Ireland (AKA Tutorial Island)
In EUIV Spain is also very fun, rushing colonization is basically like painting the map and it gives you a ton of money, once you have all of America (North and South and the Caribbean), Australia and half the Pacific and Africa you're just too OP for other to deals with you, I just ended up eating Italy, France and even started advancing east towards the Balkans against Poland-Lithuania, which got extremely big in my game
I was planning on backstabbing Austria (my allies) and probably conquering China, but I changed my PC and didn't backup the games so :'(. I've also played as Portugal (painting the map as well) and played for a couple hundred years or so as England, but I never really got that hooked in that one
In Hearts of Iron I do have more experience though
I first went to play the big countries, Germany and USSR (hope the latter gets a rework soon) and basically learnt how to play with them
Then I played with some smaller countries and realised I have no idea how to actually play lol
I'd say the Spanish Civil War is a great tutorial and it's extremely fun
I played with Spain a lot of times and loved what they did in La Resistance with it, I sometimes even started a game with no intention of playing past 1938-39 just for the civil war
It's painfully slow now, but it used to be a great way to learn how to move your army in a more flexible frontline (there were literally not enough troops to cover it before the rework) and make advances and encirclements
Nowdays it's just another war but in a smaller scale, and the focuses are pretty awesome, especially if you know the actual history behind it
So far I've played with Germany, the USSR, Spain, France, Italy, USA, Japan, Portugal and UK
It's a game I really love and strongly recommend to anyone who actually has the time to dive into it and slowly get a hold of the extremely complex mechanics of land warfare
In naval all you have to know unless you're playing with UK or the USA is submarines go BRRRRRR
I have mostly played Crusader Kings, although quite extensively
Still suck at it so I usually play "easier" early game countries
- Irish Earldoms - Easy peasy and is always cool to unite the whole of Ireland
- Kingdom of Navarra or Asturias (Spain) - I'm from Navarra so is quite fun to play around places you know
Plus Reconquista
- Lombardy or Tuscany (Italy) - I think they have a quite interesting early game
You can try to unite Italy and reform the Roman Empire
- Norse Jarldoms - Easy to grab large pieces of land from other nordic territories
Love to play as Sweden in more modern history strategy games like Total War Empire, so creating the kingdom tends to be my first target
CKII: I tend to go with smaller countries or duchies and escalate from that position
The most memorable games I've play were Navarre, Brittany, Scotland and Croatia
In this last one I failed to take control over Hungary, but it was fun
I play the one with the skill/habilities/whatever that fits my gameplay style or tastes
On Civ V I always pick Catherine the Great
I always try to keep Portugal as a friend and ally for obvious reasons, as Spain
It's true at some point during the colonization period you have to take over otherwise they become a too strong competitor
But I feel bad about wiping Portugal off the face of the Earth so I try to get a personal union or, although less happy about it, forced vassalization
I've never played Portugal but I'd love to, and I'd totally murder Spain and have a Portuguese Iberia instead
To avoid a civil war in hoi4 Portugal try to have good stability
It’s one of the best countries to play imo
Hey man I like you
I also try to do that with Spain (hoi)
You gotta try it, its a nice fun challenge
Funny, I like to play as France and try to hold the germans haha
What I usually do is war early on to get rid of the alliance with England and maybe get some of the provinces and then let them colonize for a couple centuries before conquering them
It's free real state
The Pyrenees make it kinda manageable
You either go all in with the Allies' support and try to rush through France (and probably lose hundreds of thousands) or accept the standstill in the mountains and focus on getting Africa back from Vichy
I always enjoy a good war against the Allies and getting Gibraltar back though lol
If you're bored you can always go for the reconquest back america because memes
Just be fascist or commie, bring some ships and take brazil, the rest of countries are free to take\*
\*As long as US is not guaranteeing them
Ummm
Spain's got older kingdoms inside of it but as a whole Portugal is older so
I like to think of it as three young brothers, Castille, Portugal and Aragon
Then Castille ate Aragon and then ate Potugal, but then barfed Portugal because it made it's tummy feel sick
I'm starting to think this is not the best metaphor
Gargantilla del Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago, with 44 letters
Spain: Gargantilla del Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago (44 chars)
How do you guys pronounce the parts with the "wszczcyzn"?
Villarcayo de Merindad de Castilla la Vieja, with 43 comes close
But that's a municipality, aren't gargantilla de lozoya and Pinilla de Buitrago two towns
I've found Colinas del Campo de Martín Moro Toledano with 35 letters
Don't know whats the criteria but i'll leave It here just in case
Much more epic name to be fair
No, it's the name of a town
[here]
Wow, got it
Thanks for explaining it
It does have a nice ring to it
and here IS the sign from when you leave one of the towns
A municipality can include several towns
It is  officially the town with the longest name
It was 2 towns but they got united as one with one council
It's something quite common and sometimes they keep the original names
In my in laws town they did it even if they changed the name 40 years ago
Entre 1920 y 2001 el municipio se llamó Gargantilla de Lozoya, hasta que cambió su nombre por Gargantilla de Lozoya y Pinilla de Buitrago
By the way municipality is usually used as synonymous of town/city
It can have more than one but that's not the case
Ok, my bad
Then the sign must be outdated
If you mean a city abroad, I'm supposed to go to Ghent, Belgium, to do my Erasmus this September
I still don't know if I'm going to as I delayed the decision after the exams
It'll be harder to look for accomodation by then, but I hope I have more information
If I don't, I don't really want to risk going just to be stuck at my apartment with online lessons so I'll probably reduce the Erasmus to the last semester and probably try to apply for the next year's first semester in the same place
Or maybe leave the entire erasmus for the next year
I don't know
In Europe I want to visit Rejkjavik, out of Europe I want to visit Hong Kong
I'd been wanting to take the train from Madrid to Bordeaux, staying at a couple stops along the way
I love trains and I love wine so it's like an ideal vacation for me
Never heard of it
What's the flex program
Geneva
Sport cars everywhere
Bankers and ads about watches and luxury items
Everyone wearing expensive suits
Monaco
Full of expensive car shops and expensive cars
I saw several Rolls-Royce cars and Bentleys and so on during like a 5 minute stroll
But Nice was also really posh
I live in Marbella, Spain
Luxury tourism is huge here, specially from Central/Northern Europe, Russia and the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa), so I am used to see weird license plates in rather expensive cars
The rarest I've encountered is a Dubai license plate, which really colourful and beautiful was very different from other ones I've seen from the MENA region, such as Morocco and Saudi Arabia, which are the most common
Link: [
A New Zealand plate in Zaragoza
I almost ran a red light staring at it
Arroba in Spanish
It's an old measurement equivalent to 11,502 kg
(Edit: 25,3575694 lbs)
It's an *arroba*. The symbol itself has been traditionally used in commerce to represent the unit of mass of the same name
@ = Arroba
Which is a way of saying amphora (ánfora) and was formerly a measure of weight represented by the same symbol
#TIL that it is called "at" in many languages lol
Why had I never thought about how @ would be called in other languages
La letra que roba
AFAIK arroba is the only name for the symbol
Yep, usually in this order:
* Portugal
* France
* Italy
* Any other EU country
* Whoever is playing against England
Spanish here
Usually underdogs like Croatia, Wales, Iceland, etc
I can't avoid to cheer for the underdogs
I like to cheer for Portugal, Italy or Netherlands if there is not a better option
I cheer the team that plays against France, England or Germany too
In southern Europe, we cheer **against** our neighbour countries
The farther a country is, the more we encourage it
If we're eliminated I root for the Portuguese team in the Euro Cup and Argentina in the World Cup
I feel patriotic for more than one country even
Tho I'm spannish/brittish i'll cheer for the croats and the poles or basicaly any underdog
I tend to cheer for Germany after Spain
I don't really know why
Simply, I don't cheer for any other country, I simply don't care if they win or lose
Ooh, but we do cheer for Portugal
We like you
It’s just protocol, nothing else
You can dislike us, but that doesn’t mean we won’t love you :)
Why are you so mean
How amazingly rowdy the London nightlife is
Every night
No matter where we went
We saw fights
Also, cocaine
It seemed as common as alcohol at times, even at like bbqs hahaha
When I visited in Britain, i was surprised at how little people cared for cuisine
Even parents cared very little for cooking, and young families would barely know how to cook anything
THe standards for food were extremelly low compared to the ones in Spain
Also it was surprising to me how there wasnt a  mid-day break for lunch but I now realize its Spain thats special in that regard
I went one year to Ireland (studied abroad)
boys only schools, how Green everything is all year round, how long the Sky can be covered in clouds, how much the irish LOVE their native Sports, how few gaeilge irish people can actually speak, how the police IS (virtually) unarmed, how there are no birds bigger than a seagull whatsoever, how many small birds there are, how repetitive irish food really IS, those 1 kg crisp bags, how flat everything was, gravy dust, bogs, how nice is Dublin, how crazy IS Dublin in St Patricks, how sporty irish students are, how few gingers there are (yeah, you're stereotype is Ginger)
Those from the top of my head, i was very Young and It was a long time ago,
In Ireland for 3 years, they seem to love cold wet wind
crazy people
I miss them (the people, not the wind, I hated the wind)
what time did they start to work
because here he start 8-9 and at 10:30 we usually go breakfast and this would be very shocking for me too, plus my stomach is partially closed to eat some type of food at 10:30am
That sounds a lot like Madrid, somehow I didn't expect It from Germany
>I don't think I've used cash in Finland for a good 8 years now
I think we're a bit behind
I use cash constantly, last time a few hours ago
Domestic violence is not particularly worse than in other countries, it is just that it has become a very important issue in Spanish society
We are trying to take it seriously
The slap thing is true
I live in the USA which is similar to the UK in terms of international cuisine
The thing is that countries like Spain or Italy have a "system" of cooking and eating that allows for nutritious food at an affordable price
My wife also complains about how most Spanish recipes follow the same basis and the lack of variety in supermarkets
I've lived in Cork for 3 years and I miss their restaurants
They weren't cheap but they were good as fck
People said Cork restaurants have a lot of French influence while using local products, that's what makes them so good
Their politeness ends when they enter a pub haha
See that's the thing
I assume coke is common here in spain (we rsnk high) but never in like a bbq or with friends
I remember once going to a bar in Lisboa with my aunt one summer we travelled together, she asked for a coffee with ice and the bartender automatically said "Ah, Spanish
". I was just a kid and thought it was a bit magic that he knew that fast
In hindsight, it could have also been the accent
Do you eat something else before going to bed or is dinner your last meal
Because if a normal person goes to bed at 11pm that is 5 hours without having eaten anything, I can't sleep with my stomach empty
>I find eating before 8 super strange too
Yeah, eating at 7:30
Sounds alien
We need a fisrt hand account about Spain, i think It Will Sit comfortably between the two
>My wife also complains about how most Spanish recipes follow the same basis and the lack of variety in supermarkets
How so
Genuinely curious
I really don't know much about day to day cooking in the US, so it's a bit hard to compare
What do they eat
What does spanish day to day food look like to them
and you don't have breakfast with your coworkers
Yeah, if they're loud and eating late, they're either portuguese, spanish or italian
Portuguese- sound russian
Italian- move a lot their hands
You can also spot an italian from their clothes and a German for their backpack
Never thought of It that way, but it's true
in Spain supermarkets are thought to make spanish food
There's a lot of variation to the method but the ideas repeat, it's definetely not as varied as having japanese and Indian cooking on your sleave
However i have to ask, do english people actually cook so much variety
Or do you only find It on restaurants
Because when i was in Ireland the diversity plumitted to almost 0, and my impression has always been that english people don't care much for cooking
In Spain going out to eat at a restaurant IS way less common, even takeout food doesn't seem as prevalent as in other places
If you could go a bit deeper on what patterns you see repeating in spanish cooking i would LOVE It
Para ella hay muy pocas cosas y faltan productos que son normales en los supermercados de EEUU porque hay tantos inmigrantes de todos los países del mundo
La mayoría de las recetas españolas si lo piensas están basadas en el sofrito o en pucheros de algún tipo y a veces es un poco repetitivo
En mi opinión las ventajas de la cocina española es que necesita frigos menos llenos de cosas, salsas que usas muy poco y botes de conservas
Eso y la gestión de la alacena
Digamos que mi mujer y yo, pero sobre todo ella, hace la compra en función de las recetas que vamos a cocinar y a veces por cualquier razón no cocinamos y entonces hay cosas que se echan a perder
Sin embargo, tengo la impresión que en la cocina española, salvo que vayas a hacer algo especial la compra es siempre muy similar: verduras, fruta, pollo, queso, yogur, pescado
Creo que la falta de este sistema que menciono es una pequeña parte de los factores que contribuyen a la obesidad
I met a guy who worked at a restaurant called Orso and told me that, there is like a chain of restaurants there that have all this French inspired cuisine
I remember a lot of French people living in Cork so it didn't suprised me
At what time do you dinner
You must be starving by 6pm
Tiene sentido, es verdad que la estructura del sofrito y el puchero se repite mucho
Aunque lo cierto es que parece más bien que es un problema de los sitios con gastronomía bien arragaida, es decir en china, según la región también encontrarás sabores muy similares y técnicas muy parecidas, en Japón igual, así como en Perú o en México
Al final una gastronomía tiene que tener algo que la defina
Las recetas se han ido desarrollando alrededor de un núcleo de ingredientes y técnicas y por tanto al cabo de un tiempo se puede hacer repetitiva
Pero lo cierto es que dentro de las gastronomías mundiales nunca me ha parecido que la española fuera especialmente repetitiva
I mean, no one can beat Romania at being the latín black sheep
In short: TAX HAVENS
I know that some have left the official list of havens in recent years, but different countries are constantly entering and leaving that list depending on whether or not they get agreements that allow them to pretend that they are not
For me, the worst thing is that they feed certain nationalisms that aspire to become tax havens and get rich at the expense of the impoverishment of other countries
I love them, I think decentralization is way better than full centralization, and redundancy, contrary to what some people might think, is positive
I wish there were more small states and kingdoms all over europe
I'm Catalan so I love Andorra and they're like cousins to us
I go there every year usually and honestly with all the current politics in Catalonia I think many people look up to them as an example of a future independence
I've been to Vatican City and I really enjoyed my visit, its a curious and interesting little "city".
Regretfully I don't know much about the other microstates
Sometimes I wonder how they can get their wealth from, most of them are tax havens though so it's a plus
I dont get Luxembourg
My in-laws live in France but work in Geneva, so they are pretty close to the border
They have two phones each one, a French one and a Swiss one
Visiting them mean to turn off my data plan and only turning it on when I want to look up something but checking the current network company first
This situation made me realize how man-made and arbitrary borders are
In Andorra the presidency is shared between the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell (Catalonia /so far Spain)
It's a 50%.
US trying to force a war to the limit
Always good to be reelected as President
&#x200B;
If Iran would've killed a US general, tomorrow there would be fire on Teheran
The guy was a terrorist and didn't deserve better
But assassinating him is a dumb idea (and an act of war from the US
) that will only escalate things in the middle East
Iran doesn't want war with the US, they know they won't gain anything from it
But they can retaliate against Saudi Arabia, Israel, or even closing the Ormuz strait
In summary, the US caused it but the ones paying the price will probably be their allies
That Trump's reelection prospects must be really dire if he has to
resort to outright war with Iran to garner support
I just hope Macron, Merkel and other European leaders make a firm stand against this
Even if Suleimani had indeed been leading the embassy attacks and planning to go after other US assets this hardly justifies such a reckless and inflamatory action
EDIT: after looking up a bit about the man it seems he did indeed deserve to be killed, but again, this was a reckless move that only poured gasoline to the region
Let's be real, this will be just another Gulf War
I hope
It's an error
Europe wants none if this wouldn't be surprised if we bought their oil
Usa is a kid with guns
Dangerous and erratic
On one hand you have the option of killing a man responsible for thousands of deaths in Iraq and Syria
On the other hand you have the option of killing that man and risk inflamating the region and causing more thousands of deaths
There's really no good option here, but I'd say it would have been better not to kill Suleimani, even if he deserved it
As much as he deserved to be killed, I just don't see any good outcome coming out of this (for the people in the Middle East; we know Trump will surely capitalize on it for the coming elections)
Maybe, but blowing up one of the top dogs in the Middle East with an air strike doesn't sound like a smart move if what you want is that Iran stops attacking your assets and extending their influence, let alone stabilizing the place
I doubt anybody wants war, neither Washington nor Teheran
Maybe Iran retaliates attacking objectives in Saudi Arabia or intervening further in Iraq, with the maximum being closing the Hormuz Strait
high oil prices winners:
USA, Russia, Arabia
&#x200B;
Losers:
China, Europe
I think OP meant Iran doesn't operate *against* Europe
I mean, if we were honest many state organizations could be considered as terrorist organizations
Almost every intelligence organization would belong on that list
"BUT I WANT BIG BOOM-BOOM
" Trump, probably
Arabia would win in the long term, plus the destruction of his long time shia foe
(Actually, Arabia has been dumping oil prices for some time now and is doing fine)
Russia would win with the rising prices anyway as Europe would have no alternative market
Morocco
They've already done it (even though last time it was just a rock in the middle of the sea), and there are still some unresolved border issues
Morocco
I'm in Barcelona, so, Spain
The amount of "Russia"s in this thread is astonishing
Spain
What no no we don’t....
Can we agree to trade lisbon for i dont know maybe Catalonia
Totally not
Anyway how are your air forces
Asking for a friend
Long as you respect our tapas we are fine bros
Russia being invaded by Russia sounds like a civil war to me
Still there, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but certainly not bad enough to warrant an invasion
Brexit has smoothed things up a bit for now
We would be the invaders in that case
ಠ_ಠ
We are watching you
We are experts on that
At least this time they aren't emus
And we have a counter counter attack its called pee the tagus river
There’s nothing you can do to stop it from flowing into your country
They are our main source of income during summer, so they have a higher price
Even we are trying and we didn't even joined the war
*1385 vietnam flashbacks intensifies*
Truce break and best cb should do it
Yes, we have “bares” (“bar” in singular) where you usually can have cheap food or “tapas”, really common here AFAIK, specially around university areas where they have really cheap beer
In Spain there are menu restaurants, with a fix price of 10-12€ and a full meal
They only serve menus and they are a mix of traditional, cheap food and basic food like macaroni or soup
I guess that's a typo, but I love the idea of a giant monster full of cheese and bechamel sauce
I didn't know that, but I love it
There's that old [Spanish song] about that woman who cheats on her boyfriend with two of his friends and wants to go to New York to cheat some more
You might not have heard it though
"Que tinguem sort". It's a song written in Catalan, not even in Spanish
But it's a beautiful song,  a really beautiful song with a beautiful meaning
[La canción del velero]
One of the advantages of having a global language with a worldwide music industry is that music in our language can be pretty famous everywhere
On the other side, sometimes things like Despacito happen and you can't even get away from it during your holidays abroad
Was looking for someone recommending Alligatoah, thank you sir
I was shown Du Bist Schön at my german course and since then I've been learning the lyrics
It's amazing
In Spanish he speaks completely normal, no accent and 100% correct spelling
Yes
I am a native Spanish speaker and I found it very weird as I read the books in German, since in Spanish Hagrid speaks completely normal
In middle school I was chosen for the school board as a student representative
I spent 4 years lobbying for lockers, but those are unheard of in Spain (also: budget)
Editorial companies really push their agenda and you get around 10 books a year, usually having to carry at least 5 a day + notebooks and other material
Note these books are very heavy, so I was carrying the order of 10-15+ kg with a height of 130 cm and a weight of 40-50 kg myself
Luckily the way was short, but I struggled with back problems for years until I finished compulsory education
To my knowledge, later students got their books split in smaller tomes, so they could carry only 1/3 of the pages to school, and to be fair for a couple years we got a very thoughtful teacher who established a system wherein we each got a little bit of shelf-space in the classroom cabinet, but yeah, I consider books and material carrying one of the many systemic problems in Spanish education
I've never went to a school with lockers
In my current highschool we have lockers, which appear to only be symbolic because nobody uses them
Why
Because they have no lock, no code, no padlock
Anyone can open it by twisting the thing
Every single corridor is lined with these dead lockers
I don't know either
My HS had acquired lockers when I was in \~2 year (12-13yo) since the alternative was carting around 10 Kg+ bags all over the place (yes, only the essential books for the day)
They were for rent, though, and my parents didn't believe in them, so
Obligatory "Kids these days have it so easy" xD
I'd've loved to have had books in fascicles, my bag would have been soooooooo much lighter
I didn't realise how that makes me look, hahaha
But really, it's great that kids these days have it easier
My backpack was inhumane
> I didn't realise how that makes me look, hahaha
It helps if I cherrypicked a single sentence from your two paragraphs hahahahahah
I just realised that a few years ago, when I did a week of the Camino, I carried ***less*** weight (8Kg) on my back than an average day of highschool (10-13 Kg)
FOR A WEEK ON THE ROAD
Absolutely ridiculous
Yes
I do frequent hiking/camping and my full backpack for 15 days with water and some food was only slightly heavier than the school one
Besides, those backpacks are much more comfortable and better suited for heavy weights
School backpacks are usually very uncomfortable on the shoulders for me
millions = millones
billions = miles de millones (thousands of millions)
trillions = billones
quadrillions = miles de billones
And so on
In Spanish it's as in German, millones, millardos, billones, billardos, trillones, trillardos, etc
But the -ardo ones are barely used so it's more common to use "mil millones" (a thousand millions) than "un millardo" (a millard)
10³=mil
10⁶=millón
10⁹=mil millones
10¹²=billón
10¹⁵=mil billones
10¹⁸=trillón
million = millón
billion = mil millones (“one thousand millions”)
trillion = billón
Same in Spanish
["Millardo"] exists for "miles de millones" like close words in other languages in this post
Also "billardo" for a thousand billions and "trillardo" for a thousand trillions (from the same article)
Absolutely nobody uses "millardo", though, unless maybe in some specific scientific context, although I have never heard it uttered
You only use "millardo" when explaining that word actually exists lol
I know the word exists, but I literally haven't heard or seen it used even once
You always see "mil millones".
I heard it on a gameplay though
Was it from a Spaniard
Yes, MayorceteGaming
On this gameplay:
I just realised it is the game itself that uses the word "millardo".
A friend of mine lives in the town of Alcalá de Henares (  )
This place is old
Talking various preroman sites old
And the thing is this friend lives in the city center and was making some work in the garage and they torn down a wall and suddenly they were in the catacombs, that used to be the late roman-early medieval streets
So fucking cool
I read all three Metro books and I thought Metro-2 was just an inside lore thing
Interesting
Didn't know about it
Is ithe book canon
I'll probably read it, then
Usually people would say: Weather, Gastronomy (paella, tapas and much more),  Wine, History and Culture, Parties (sangria), Flamenco (Olé),  Soccer and sports in general (Nadal, Alonso, Gasol, Marc Marquez, Carolina Marin
Also, the fact that more people speak Spanish than English
It's the second-most widely spoken language in the world (after Mandarin Chinese), with 400 million native speakers, and official status in a staggering 21 countries, spanning South, Central and North America, as well as Africa and Europe
Also, unfortunately Bullfights, but thankfully it's slowly disappearing
And I would like to add some unknown things:
We are the third country with the most World Heritage sites behind Italy and China
There is a bar for every 169 inhabitants, the highest average in the European Union
We are leaders in organ donation
We are top-3 most visited countries (with France and USA)
Spain is the first country in the world in terms of acceptance of homosexuality, only 6% of the population believes that it is "morally unacceptable
We are at the forefront of Europe in cocaine use
We invented the mop, the stapler, the lollipop, the submarine, the cable car, the foosball
We are one of the European countries with the lowest suicide rate
We win in bars per capita, this is a good one
Our constant Infighting
Oh and beaches too
High quality infrastructures
We have one of the largest high speed train systems in the world, with trains reaching the highest speeds in Europe
And Madrid has one of the largest metro systems as well
We are one of the world leaders on super-fast broadband availability
Motorways/freeways are mostly free and well cared
Importing of olive oil, the second most visited country, and the country that once conquered a huge part of the world (and there is still discussion about it)
And also confusing with Mexicans
Great public Healthcare, I guess
Oh, and also we are in top 3 olive oil producers/exporters
They guy who invented the mop patented it and became very rich
I love Basque, but a lot of languages have no known relatives around the world
For example Korean has more speakers and it is considered an isolated language too
And a lot of smaller languages, too
Tbh, me too
That's what Charles I of Spain said Like 300 years before the british Empire was a thing :)
The rave scene started in the UK though, and the concept of "superstar DJs" like Paul Oakenfold
I can name many current DJs and producers from UK like Third Party, Gareth Emery, Carl Cox or Above and Beyond
No, we don't.
No, it's rare but I usually do it
Here we say it to the bus driver when we enter
Not in Spain
You are not alowed to exit to the front so no way you can say anything to the driver
But we do say hello or goodmorning or whatever when we enter
I don't know about anywhere else, but for general public transport in Madrid you don't. Mostly because there's a second door in the middle, where you get off the bus, and then obviously, you're too far away
Same, although plenty of people say nothing even at the entrance
Well, not everybody, but some people does
Especially in smaller towns or when the bus is almost empty
I'm from a small town and no one says anything because you disembark through the rear door
Me, a Spaniard, watching some English, Welsh, and Irish people arguing about the correct and polite term to mention the two islands in the north of France
\[insert the stonks meme man with "cultur" in it\]
Usually I'd support them taking the anti-capitalist side, but in this case they're anything but that when it comes to their actual business
They take an absurd amount of money selling virtual items to people who get hooked on their games, especially Hearthstone
People spend thousands on that game
So fuck them for that
It will look veary bleak on blizzard's part when china eventualy changes, but we can only hope
I know it will have no real effects (Blizzard will definitely win more money thanks to their decision than they'll lose from any boycott from western players), but I'm not going to buy any Activision-Blizzard games if they don't change their stance
A shame as I wanted the new Call of Duty, but eh, I have a lot of games to play anyway
I understand, but in my case for example I was in doubt of joining wow classic and now I just dont
So for many people just made their decision easier
Fuck any totalitarian party*. There are democratic communist parties and the CCP isn't even communist
Why this is the first time I read this
Please make a post about this
I understand the sense but sorry, I honestly cringed
There are
It has never been applied, for sure, and it may never happen, but theoretically in democratic communism the establishment of the new system is progressive and through democratic means and the economy is controlled through democratic decisions as well, not by an unlected bureaucracy
Not saying I support that or that it's feasible, just that there are people who support those things and also multiparty democracy with full rights and guarantees
I'm not talking about Cold War EE communist regimes nor their nostalgics
It is to prevent hackers from deleting accounts, and has been implemented way before the China thing many years ago
But I do agree that I wouldnt trust neither Activision to have my face ID seeing how easy they fall for leak attacks
But surely we should differentiate between people who support that and people who support Stalinism or Maoism, shouldn't we
>Not saying that I support it or tht it's even feasible
Did you miss the part of supporting democracy with full rights and guarantees
Democratic communists and socialists aren't people just waiting to be voted to establish dictatorship
I thought we were talking about totalitarianism vs democracy, not about economic success
Portugal and Spain
Portugal looks like a face and Spain is its hair making the Iberian Peninsula a head
If we go farther France is a neck and Italy is a claw making Europe look like a human faced T-rex
Spain is a toilet
I always think of the Yucatan peninsula as the largest continental dick
I love that we form a face looking to the side
Well, if we add Portugal ;)
Every EU country positon is the same: "no, don't do it, that is not good
" but tbh on a more national level people and the government just don't fucking care about yet another war on that region
It's a fucking landgrab
One day the world will look on Yemen and Syria the way it looks on 1930s Spain and Czechoslovakia
Everyone is being a dick lately .
Just the same here,  I tried to think about it deeply
Yet the genocide of kurds should not be tolerated by Europe and something must be done, but what
I bet you are fun at parties, huh
I was just stating the complete lack of interest europe in general (and spain in particular) with the constant conflicts that part of the world has
It's sad but it's just a fact, very few peoole care
Because they won't be an agreement
Pissed enough so the givernments will agree to send troups or do actually useful about it
I just Doubt it, man
We can be angry for a week but we won't care for much longer and if we did we wouldn't hesitate on doing what's needed
I know when they aren't native speakers because I understand them
When someone is speaking a second language they speak slower and clearer
Easy rule
If somebody uses 3 vocals at the same time and uses lazy consonants
Boom, native
Example: æxcüese me sïer, äre you frœm England
Unless it is highly predominant the O, so there is a chance to be oirish
Example, hoy, moyt, hoy yo dooin'
Side note, if there is no T, probably English
Yes because everyone has accents when they speak
If English is a second language there is usually an accent and/or phrase rhythm and tone that stands out in varying degrees
Absolutely, we can even detect where they are from
And we can detect the English speakers accent too
Even if their accent in English is really good, there are a few ones I think I can identify: Spanish, Italian, French and Greek tend to be the most obvious, maybe German and Dutch too
Beyond that, I can only tell whether they are Nordic or Easter European, but I can't pinpoint the exact country, and for some reason I mix up Polish and Russian accents in English
I am Spanish, living in the UK and working in an international environment
Oh, and after 10 years in the UK I can identify some regional accents too: Brummie, Scouse, Scottish (but can't tell Glaswegian from Edinburgh or anywhere else), Landan, Manchester, Sommerset
It's fun trying to guess, it's like a game
Depends on where they're from
People from some places have stronger accents, for instance Spaniards, Italians and Greeks are usually easy to recognize, so are the French
For others I can usually tell they're foreign, but not where they're from
Of course there's always exceptions, people without the local accent
For instance, from what I've been told I have a "foreign" accent in English, but not the typical Spanish accent
And some people manage to fully get rid of their accents, usually by living in an English speaking country for a long enough time
It depends on how good they are, obvious examples with 2 of our politicians:
Pablo Iglesias, it's obvious he's not a native speaker: [
Ivan Espinosa, if I didn't know he's spaniard, I'd have thought he's an English native speaker: [
Those are extreme examples, of course, if someone sits in the middle I'm not sure if I'd know if he's a native speaker or not
Let me introduce you the Greeks
They have the exact same accent as Spaniards in English
I'm ashamed to say I have spoken Spanish to many Greeks because I was 100% sure they were Spaniards after I hear their English
In writing, one thing that gives away Germans is when they let slip "until" instead of "by". As in, "I need this until 3 PM" meaning "by 3 PM". I've seen Germans with an otherwise excellent command of English, written and spoken, do this
Why is it
I imagine you use the same German word for both
Just that
Double consonants does the music and and hand movements, the dance
It is an artsy way
I've been four time in Rome and the difference is not exactly subtle, but it is not difficult to adapt the pronunciation and speak a proper Italian, with accent
But yes, Spanish version of lo schiaccianoci is 'lo eschiakianochi', no rythm
Everybody cringes HARD at their own country's accent
But don't feel forced to switch back, faking a good accent is the first step to actually acquiring it
"Morder el polvo" (bite the dust) has in my experience the connotation of failing big at something, or being humiliated (you cannot sink lower), more than of dying (of course it might come from that, but I haven't seen that use) . For example, before a game: "we will make them bite the dust/Les haremos morder el polvo".
Alternativas: Estirar la pata/To stretch your leg
Irse al otro barrio/To go to the other neighborhood
Espicharla/(not sure how to translate this
Your dick falls off
Diñarla
Cascar[la]/To crack
For being dead already: Estar criando malvas/To be gardening mallow flowers
In Spanish "Moder el polvo"(bite the dust) is used when someone is defeated and humiliated
Is not used with the sense of death or is related to dying
&#x200B;
We say "estirar la pata" (Stretch/tense the leg
Also "pata" is non-human leg a human leg is called "pierna") or "irse al otro barrio" (go to other neighborhood) or "está descansando con los gusanos" (he/she is resting with the worms) or "está criando malvas" (growing mallow flowers) when someone die
Nothing, that expression does not exist in spanish, or if translated, it is an unnatural translation of the english version
Edit: since people are giving other examples, there is «estirar la pata», that means stretch the leg
We have "morder el polvo" - biting the dust - probably a transliteration from English, but usually people dont "bite", but "stretch their leg" instead - "Estirar la pata" - referring to rigor mortis
The best one for me: "irse al corral de los quietos" which roughly trasnlated as "going to the farmyard of the quiet ones". It's not funny translated, but whatever
Sería más como "going to the farmyard of the still ones", "quiet" sería de los silenciosos
yeah that's true
It means both quiet and still as I understand it
Our mealtimes
Lunch around 14:00
Dinner around 22:00
&#x200B;
Also, stores (not big chains) close at lunch time
Everybody is eating, is like +40 ºC outside, nobody is going to go out and buy stuff, plus it's not safe work under those conditions (think about construction workers or farmers, office work have a more "standard" timetable since they have AC) No reason to be open
Probably the "pass the bucket" culture
Its not as bad as in China, but a lot of people like to "pass the bucket" of a problem to a different person
Its what happens with lazy government workers a lot, that keep "bouncing" you from place to place
In spain whe have a thing called “persianas”, best Arab import you guys should check it out
Just came from another post and here It IS
One defining trait of Spain might be our playing cards
The more universally mainstream IS the french deck but in spain you'll usually see the spanish deck
It's not unique though, they also have them in Italy
Except for tuscany
for some reason
The last three Cars have special names "sota" "caballo" (Horse) and "rey"(King) [spanish deck]
This is both hilarious and sad
Basque is pretty similar in the sense that 80 is 20x4 or 40 is 20x2
It took me a while even to understand what you were saying
WHY DO YOU COUNT LIKE THAT IT'S DIABOLIC
Admired by citizens of other countries I must say
The late mealtimes are not only unique inside Europe, I think that we are weird on this matter all over the world
Anyway, I want  to take advantage of this to send a message to all our European friends & colleagues
Please, stop setting meeting at 14:00pm, please stop #DoItForSpain
Another unique thing might be our unusually long workdays and the absurd time we get for lunch break
I've been told It comes from mashing together morning and afternoon Jobs into one
For example my aunt works roughly from 9:30-7:00 but god save the 2 HOURS  lunch break
Most people actually leave the office to eat
we just Don't quite get the Sandwich lunch of the english
(For those curious, we also eat heavy dinners though normally lighter than the lunch)
Are you sure you're not Spanish
You cannot write Spain without pain
I think in Morocco they have our mealtimes
But in spain it would be more like 14:00 to 18:00 around where I used to live
Maybe because of the sun hours, we have same time zone but way more in the West so sun for us is stronger on different hours than yours
Yeah but in Spain if you eat at 12:00 you'll get some suspicious/funny looks
2 for lunch in spain IS even a bit early
Specially in summer
Most people eat between 2 and 3
And if you're working you can even eat at 4
idk, maybe
> which is because of tourists and trade etc
No, it's because Franco wanted to have the same time zone as his friend Hitler
Yeah, usually at 7:00 or 8:00
The lunch is a proper meal, not just a sandwich
>Siesta
Siesta is like sangria, not really a thing between spaniards
I'm spanish
don't compete with a portuguese on cod
you'll loose
If there's one thing they know how to cook IS bacalhau
And
>most production of salted cod (bacalao) is in Northern Europe (Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands)
Don't we eat THAT
Iceland and norway add Up to roughly 6 million and we (Portugal and Spain) add Up to 56
i'm sure cod IS a vital part of their cuisine but even taking into account (this measure IS taken from all fish spexies, couldnt find one for cod) we consume half the fish per capita we still consume almost 5 times more fish
and the portuguese LOVE their cod
production doesn't NECESARILY mean consumption
i just found an article that claims that Spain IS the biggest consumer of cod in the world
and i would bet we eat way less cod per capita than Portugal
Cod IS a religion there
We share some parts of our history, such as industrializing very late in our history (china did it even later than us)
So for example in China they keep pre-industrial era midday breaks, similar to our lunch breaks
Its not always a siesta but the workday is split in two, the morning shift and afternoon shift
"Sandwiches" are for breakfast
Dinner is something lighter than the lunch but it can be warm too
It's a lunch break
The story IS pretty funny because It shows how wrong the whole "siesta" stereotype IS (not that It didn't exist, It was a thing
until It wasn't)
We spanish work long workdays, we're talking from 9 to 19 but we have a huge "lunch break" in the middle (2 HOURS) and It just doesn't make sense NOW
however Spain wasn't always the same
About 70 years ago we were just escaping from a brutal civil War, most people were dirt poor (my grandparent worked since he was 14 and his mother was imprisoned for smuggling) and had two Jobs to compensate for the meeger salaries ....one in the morning and one in the afternoon
with time we got accostumed to this framework and when we started having one work instead of two the dirt was already settled on our strange workday
it's long and with a huge pause because it's really two
glued together
Yeah, 40 hours a week IS the legal barrier here
However many people work more especially in private companies
there's the "tradition" of not leaving office until the Boss leaves Office
thus my aunt normally gets home for late dinner 9:30-10:00
In reality most people work more than 40 hours a week it's just not counted that way
About a year ago they implemented a system of filing to avoid these "extra-hours" to no avail, people file out when the workday "ends" and then continue working
they also file in at given hours instead of when they start working
>However, then my shoe broke during the lunch break and I had no chance but to sit it out
And yeah
sorry about that
Excuse me, how do I get that flag
Surprisingly close to the situation in Spain, except for the dialect thing
Basque country
They don't speak a knoen language, have weird genetics
For geographic regions overall the canary islands, they are very far
There's an island which has a language of only whistles, and they have a quite interesting history, and an accent that sounds more Latinamerican than anything else
I would say Murcia
Despite having regions with different languages, in Murcia they speak the same language 99% of people speak, but it doesn't seems like it
They don't even have a dialect I would say, it is just a very strong accent
Everyone I've ever met from Murcia was a weird, but fun person
Everyone
Catalonia and the Vasc Country
Murcia
The Basque Country
Just the language makes them the odd one, not being related to any other in the world
Every map of Spain shows a region in the southeastern coast called "Murcia".
It actually doesn't exist, it's like an imaginary place where no one has ever been to, but everyone uses as a point of reference for what's weird or impossible
Quite the phenomenon
Vasque Country
They have their own language and we still don't know it's roots
It's the oddest one, I would say
In Spain there are two odd regions: Vasque Country and Extremadura
Vasque Country's own language is Euskera, one of the few Mediterranean languages that doesn't come from Latin: Euskera is a celtic language that has been talked since the Prerromanic period
Extremadura is a big rural region with a very little population, and living there is like burying yourself socially, as even the Internet doesn't work well
To be fair, we have a lot of weird regions in Spain
Also Basques are the Spanish equivalent of Russians, because their main stereotype is that they overdo and oversize everything
Also, they never fuck
Edit: [Spanish memes about Basques
] They are in Spanish, but you get the idea with the images
Wait how does having people from all over the place (ex Yugoslavia) translate into a stronger regional identity
Teruel
Apparently, it exists now
How many Basques are needed to change a lightbulb
Five, one holds the lightbulb and the other four spin the house
It's creative, I'll give you that

Leonardo Dantés
Tamara AKA Ambar AKA Yurena
&#x200B;
I refuse to search them on youtube and its recomendation algorithms
We have some of those as well but from bigger reality shows and better video production, even if the music is as shitty
[For example]
wtf really
jajaja
Nope her videos became famous because she was famous in Spain
Used to be a big star in children TV shows and everyone loved to laugh at how far she had fallen
Ah so it's the Bulgarian equivalent to reggaeton
I wish it was
My mother used to say "Kids will have sex anyway, I prefer them to do it safely under my roof than on a dark alley or a car in the streets".
That said of course you closed the door and tried to be quiet, but my parents knew perfectly what we were doing and there was no problem
It's generally ok to have your SO stay for the night from time to time, as long as it's a more or less serious relationship
People aren't loud in general, even if they live alone, as far as I know
It's very rare to hear your neighbors through the walls at night, in general
Our walls are made of bricks, we don't usually use wood for building houses, or anything else in general, so noise doesn't travel that easily
Also, most people that are very active sexually or want to be autonomous tend to prefer to rent a room in a shared apartment with people of a similar age range (it's cheap and their parents are not going to be around)
This is super common for college students, especially if they're studying in a different city from the one they come from
Since we have proper scholarships, people with low income doesn't have to pay tuition and some get some extra money to cover part of their expenses during the year, so they spend it on the rent
They're not loans, they don't have to return them in any way, but they do need to pass most of their subjects to keep being eligible for the scholarship the next year
While we generally have smaller houses, the living space is way better distributed than in a house with several floors
We also tend to manage our storage space way better that people from the USA, from what I've seen
People never really share bedrooms unless they're a couple or really small kids
Most families have at least 3 bedrooms in their house (income doesn't make much of a difference in this, since most apartments here are built that way), and usually less than 3 kids
Same in Spain, and my family tends to also scream across the house or announce before going into a closed room
Roughly the same for Spain, but "conservative" parents may not allow it not* because of religion but "respecting your family". Most of us just wait to have our parents out of home to sneak in
Maybe that's why we have many motels and 2-star hotels (hostales) everywhere
I swear I've heard that exact phrase before because all my friends commented once that this was exactly what their parents told them all
The Kingdom Council
Do you know the council in Game of Thrones
Well, that's it
It was created in 1552 by the emperor Charles V. Nowadays it's formed by former ministers and presidents
The council is asked by the Government about laws and important issues to give its opinion (in a technical way, not political)
It's  usually considered a way to give money to retired politicians
or a good way to share their expertise
>- Sea-Airport Cuxhaven / Nordholz GmbH: We have an airport without a flight plan that is just barely in use and fund it with 8 million Euros ...
Sounds like Spain to me
Yes
That one
The one who controlled half Europe
Charles V probably copied that from Burgundy for each of his realms
It doesn't have lyrics so it's kinda shitty
You'll be killed for singing the Spanish national anthem, tho
You would be speechless
well
it has no lyrics, and the melody is pretty mediocre, so
I don't like it
We (all) should learn of the DDR's anthem, that song gives me tingles every time I listen to it
An anthem with no lyrics is absurd
It should have lyrics
It should have lyrics
It's a boring military march with no lyrics I feel no attachment to
We should've got back the Himno de Riego after Francoism
It isn't realy a republican anthem, it's a constitutionalist anthem that was the anthem during the Liberal Triennium and the two republics
It has a very Marseillaise feel about fighting to defend the motherland's freedom and it came from the people
It wasn't a march handpicked by a king 250 years ago
Feel like pure shit I just want the [Himno de Riego] back
It's the best, you don't even have to learn the lyrics
Well there are only two versions you can sing
The fun but very disrespectful version, or Riego’s hymn (which is the republican hymn, so you can see the problem with that)
At some point in the future, I’d love to have a hymn that isn’t a military march, and actually had words to it
But all things considered, I’d have to wait quite a while for that
At least it has easy lyrics
LOLOLOLO
But it's the same anthem that we had in the 1st Spanish Republic but without lyrics, so that makes it a good anthem for me
And in the other hand, I wouldn't like some patriotic lyrics in the Spanish anthem
See that´s why ours doesnt have any lyrics and we just scream LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOOLOLOLO
Yeah it was a joke
I live in Euskadi so you know, if you wear something Spain related here you'll get some weird looks
As long as I never have to sing or hear again the Marta Sánchez version I'm okay with it
That song still haunts me
Anyone that's proud of being Spanish or wears something with the Spanish flag gets called fascist, racist and everyone assumes that you're an intolerant extreme right voter
Just for showing the Spanish flag yes
Vuelvo a casa, a mi amada tierra
***shivers violently***
That's just simply not true
Just look at the news
Yeah but you're saying it like there isn't a reason for that
I literally haven't said anything, mostly because I think it's a complex issue for people who probably are not up to the news here
I'll have to write the Bible to explain every side and perspective the problem has
I can agree on that but just know that if someone calls you a facist either they're a extreme leftist or they're right
No one should call you facist for liking your country
Agree completely but nowadays it seems like everyone is so mad and full of hate that we no longer tolerate each other anymore
Probably I see it this way because I live in Euskadi and you surely know that issue is specially problematic here
I'm not sure about san Marino, but i think i've seen a liechtensteiner around and there's an andorran too
The thing i love in this sobreddit it is there is a lot of different cultures
Yeah i stuck for the community
This is the nicest most quirky sub i've seen in reddit
Everyone IS there to help, respectfull, attentive
People are here to enjoy and learn
I really LOVE that
This man, absolutely this
I remember there was a liechtensteiner because someone just randomly asked him about how his country was
It was one of the first things i remember from this sub
In late summer/early fall maybe six to ten
In winter four or five
4 or so
Most people in Spain have one of the [multiple Nocilla collectible glass containers] that Nocilla comes in
they’ve been around forever
Paelleras maybe
&#x200B;
A paella specific pan
[Persianas]  I don't know if it's true or not, but as far as I know in northern Europe you don't have these kinds of blinds, without which we Spaniards can't live hehehe
old people like to put statues of christ on the cross or of saints and have a lot of ceramics at home, they might also have pictures from weddings from the family, or from the [first communion] of the kids
Also [palillos] hand fans
that's pretty accurate
They are relatively common in Spain
I've been in a lot of houses with one (and of course they are in every bar)
"This thing" is a finnish invention
Everybody have one of these here
A danish butter cookies container filled with sewing supplies
&#x200B;
Fun fact, "Pryca" (supermarket chain) does not exist anymore, closed in 2000
They are super common in Spain and Portugal too
Funnily enough not in France despite inventing them
I've always been weirded out by those in movies
Never seen one in Europe
why mold would grow there
>Almost, except for Portugal I don't remember any other country where bidets are present in more than 90% of households
Spain
He meant that the name of the pan is paella
All the houses I know have one
Maybe the places you went were too new or tourist oriented
well, TIL
I always called the pan paellera
and paella is the food
It is mandatory in Spain
The project has to be aproved with at least one "whole" bathroom
"Whole" includes bidet
in dutch PLATYPUS is calles Vogel-Beck-Dier = Bird-beak-animal
simmilarly Lignin (stuff that makes trees hard) is houtstoff = woodstuff
We call it «fris fris» becuase of the sound it makes
Reminds of jeux vidéo, instead of vidéo jeux
It’s the same in Spainish “hacer caca” / “hacer pipi”
The Spanish word for ladybug can also mean 'gay'
We call them zebra crossings in Spanish too
Grammar*.
Also in Spanish and catalan, but it's not that much defined in some cases
I'm English we are taught the specific order they should be given, in Spanish I think there's not a specific universal order, but it still exists
For example, "la gran y veloz avioneta" is ok, but "la veloz y gran avioneta" sounds weird
I agree with you completely
I have seen, and written too, entire paragraphs in Spanish that consist of only a long, complex, and convoluted sentence that, however, sounds completely logical to the native Spanish speaker, more used to compound sentences than the average English speaker, that prefers the more "start and stop", so to speak, structure of their language
In Spanish it's considered I correct and hardly seen in written form, but somewhat usual in spoken language in some regions
And in Spain we had Gabriel Rufián bringing [a printer] and at a different point [a pair of handcuffs] He is like that, the parliament's buffoon
The printer was about the illegal referendum in Catalonia
The regional law that called for the referendum violated about half a dozen laws both in form and in content, so the referendum was disallowed, etc
Rufián, being Rufián, took the printer to the Parliament to explain that the Catalans could print the ballots themselves ("with this humble republican Samsung printer" he said)
As for the handcuffs, he used them in November 2017 just as props to say "I wish one day Mariano Rajoy will wear this".
He's from a Catalan separatist party, I find it a bit more unlikely than those examples
Rufián is an MP for Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, a Catalan nationalist party that in Congress only gets some 4-5 MPs, so it is not going to happen
In Spanish it's "have sex", but then we also have "make the love", so
In Spanish we have sex but we make THE love
We are more romantic and we have sex (tener sexo), but we do/make love (hacer el amor)
The have sex "tener sexo" is probably one of the worst recent additions to Spanish from English
It sounds horrible
I’d say “practicar sexo” is more popular
Is it an English loan-word/-expression
I thought it was Spanish proper, as in "tener relaciones sexuales" ----> "tener sexo". While you can say "mantener relaciones sexuales" but not "mantener sexo". But I agree it sounds awful xD
Idealmente
"Tener relaciones sexuales" is fine, that's what a ginecologist would say
"Tener sexo" is a literal translation from English
But to be fair, we have no elegant word for "follar".
> "Tener sexo" is a literal translation from English
Hum, I am not entirely convinced, but maybe you are right
I have tried to search for an etimology on Google but nothing comes up
>But to be fair, we have no elegant word for "follar".
Yeah, that's the real problem here xD
&#x200B;
I have found instances as far back as 1975 in some Spanish [corpora] I don't think it's an English imitation
But if it is it's well settled in common usage already
They're seen as flowers, you can sometimes find some baked goods with poppy seeds, but they're not that common
So if you ask a Spaniard about poppies, the thing they'll be thinking about is the flower, mostly because there's a point of the year where they seem to be growing everywhere
For us they're just [pretty flowers that grow on the fields] People like to take selfies and pictures on them
We don't really do anything else with them, as far as I know, they just come and go with the seasons, they're part of the landscape
I guess some breads might have poppy seeds along with many other seeds, but I don't know for sure
First as a flower, then as source of opium and lastly as a condiment
We Don't use poppy Seeds that much, you might find them in some pastries, but it's pretty weird
However, I've Heard we're the top 1 legal exporter of opiates
We have fields upon fields of poppies from Madrid to Valencia
So why do we associated It to the flower
in spring they are EVERYWHERE
In the train rails, in your garden, in between the cobblestones of your street, in the fields, in between the rocks
Just in Madrid i think we have 3 or 4 different species
Oh, cool, I didn't know that
I just googled this out of curiosity and apparently Spain is one of the biggest producers of legal opium in Europe, so I guess we do have that variety as well
You were right about the one in the fields being *Papaver rhoeas*.
I also found out that some people here use this wild variety for salads and tea, just the petals, which apparently don't have enough concentration of psychotropics to do much to people
It's interesting, because I had always thought they were dangerous for the human body
We have the black novels about detectives and crimes, and pink for romantic novels
In journalism we have pink press for gossip and yellow press for media using eye-catching and even fake headlines for increased sales instead of well-researched news and articles
Salmon press is the economy and finances sections on newspapers (because is the color of the paper used for those sections)
I always heard the economic pages in newspapers referred as "salmon pages" (btw that reminds me of yellow pages phonebook and I wonder if in other countries they also have a phone guide with yellow pages
) but never as salmon press, however I searched it up and apparently it's actually called like that, TIL
The Spanish company is called *Páginas Amarillas* (yellow pages) as well
The part for businesses and service advertisements is yellow, and the part for private landlines is white (Páginas Blancas), but most people don't put their private landlines on the phonebook anymore, because it makes you vulnerable to scams
Also, most people has switched to the internet nowadays, and so has the Páginas Amarillas company
Idk if this counts but in spanish there’s a game where you talk normal but with only using one vowel
Like for example: I saw a blue car
Vi un coche azul (normal)
Va an cacha azal (only using the a vowel)
In Spanish my father told me about a language game about repeating every syllable but adding a p, like this:
Instead of saying "Gilipollas" (which is something similar to dumbass)
You had to say "Gipilipipopollaspas" repeating the last syllable and adding a p.
It's actually very difficult to talk like that but my father could, just gotta practice
Does it really exist
I always thought it was something made up in The Simpsons' dub to Castilian Spanish
I've never heard of this before
I've never heard of it before
We could really have done without Franco, the spanish dictator who started spain’s only civil war in 1936
He led to social and economical repercussions that lasted decades
Stop spending gold like crazy and actually worrying about Dutch people might have avoided the disastrous defeat against the Netherlands
Also if the people were a little smarter and religion didn't play such an important role in Spain, I would be happy with Napoleon winning in Spain, or the Spanish winning and the king accepts the constitution
It would have helped prevent the slow downfall that our country had and could have prevented many conflicts
If we hadn't fucked up, Spain and Portugal would've probably remained united under the house of Austria, and the Iberian peninsula would've mostly ruled the world
All of South America, most of North America, Africa's coastline, the Philippines, a bit of India, the south of Italy, Sicily and The Netherlands
And whatever else we could've had next
Definitely the civil war
I wonder how our country might be now if some right wing generals hadn't decided to fuck things up for 40 years
Instead we got Franco people in our highest courts and the Franco family is a freaking Noble House
A continuous event or a single event
If it was a continuous event it would be the inflation of the gold and silver brought back from America to Spain, wich left the kingdom of spain almost as quickly as it entered, while the actual kingdom's economy and agriculture didnt have much efforts of improvement
If it was a single event, it would be the Treaty of Utrech
Ignoring unforeseeable consequences, I wish the civil war had ended differently
Putting my own political opinions aside, I feel that we had a late start into the modern era due to the lack of democracy until the late 70s.
Probably would make the empire's colonies management better
That the Civil War didin't start
We may have entered the World War, but we wouldn't have had a dictatorship
Exactly what I was going to write
What I wanted to say or alternatively not prevent the drowning that almost occurred in his childhood
I think without Franco there would have been no civil war
I wish he hadn’t risen to power
I never said that's what I wanted
If I could change something, it would be that, because it's the best thing I could think of  that:
A) Didn't relate to our last civil war, because that's too easy
B) Made the biggest impact to our current world
Think for a moment of how different the world would've been
The USA would probably not exist
I don't want to have colonies
In fact, even if what I gave as an example were to be real, I'm pretty sure they'd eventually become independent
As they should
But I can see howmy original comment could be interpreted that way
fair, then just not having that war but along with it i guess comes the dictatorship
People is usually completely unaware of this so most British and Spaniards might tell you "no, we walk either side" but I use to go to the UK because of work and I wondered why I was continuously almost bumping into people in those kind of encounters in the office while in Spain that just flows naturally (for me)
also if I spent more than usual in the UK, I was finding my moves more rough back in Spain so I became conscious of this as well and yes
Spaniards tend to walk on the right side and British tend to walk on the left side
Also I found that London is completely mixed in this regard so it might be harder to observe there than in other parts of the UK
Probably they receive much more international visitors in their offices there so "unconscious rules" have adapted to that
Not written on stone but repeated enough times for not being a coincidence
The [Don Quixote] books are a brutal satire of the [wandering knight archetipe] which was very popular in Europe at the time
Aside from that, the closest thing to gunslingers we ever had in this country were the [bandoleros] (brigands) , which, even though had actually existed for a long time in one form or another (a famous earlier one is mentioned in Don Quixote), reached their peak in the XIX century after the [wars against the French invasion] Their character was greatly romanticised partly due to the overlap between actual criminals and the guerrilla warriors that fought the Napoleonic troops, and also because they were seen as rebels against the [often despotic governments] that followed
There were songs and poems dedicated to them, and in the 70s there was even a TV show about the adventures of a group of bandits lead by Curro Jimenez, who was based on a [real-life brigand]
In Spain it would be a Knight or a mercenary in the middle ages
Or both, as El Cid was
Great answer for Spain
It might be useful to add a comment here about the more general archetype of the homeless wanderer that uses wit and deception to try unsuccesfully to go up the social ladder, and by chance or intentionally helps fellow people from the lower classes of society
The Lazarillo de Tormes novel or El Buscon by Quevedo are first examples of this
There is also the wandering sword for hire type from the renaissance like Capitán Alatriste and Íñigo Montoya from "the princess bride". I think that's more stereotypically Spanish
Yup - just to add on, this genre is called picaresca, because this kind of person is called "pícaro", which could be translated as "naughty" "rogue" or "rascal".
Uh, I thought every country in the European continent (America aswell) write them when referring to centuries
You use 17th instead of XVII
Oh, I'm happy to hear that :)
AFAIK is the most translated book in the world behind The Bible
>I wonder about the Spanish Conquistador
It is not a thing in Spain
In Spain we could say that we had our Wild West during the Reconquista, in the border of the Duero
It was a land of no one
Both the Christians and the Moors did skirmishes in that terrain, or even getting into each other's territories to loot and even kill the people who was living there
So I think that is what best fits
I don't know
I have just found out they exist xd
The modern version are the [Spanish Maquis] who fought against the dictatorship
Those navajas were used by bandoleros, outlaws that stole from the rich
The were quite a thing in Andalucía (South of Spain)
There are many legends and songs about them
Hollywood even made a movie with Charlton Heston as the Cid and Sophia Loren as Julieta (his wife)
But most of the story is not real History
He was more a mercenary than a crusader against the Moors
I would say the same, yes
>why would we translate roman numerals for when we have numbers
Ask you king, Carl XVI Gustaf, he is not called Carl 16 Gustaf after all
Really
I have never seen written centuries as "siglo 3" or "siglo 17" it even hurts seeing it
That's true, indeed
I mean it's not that it's hard, but I agree with the American
It's pretty unnecessary, just an old tradition that's stuck around
We have some regulates prices for electricity, and recently some price regulation for mask and hidroalcoholic gel
The prices of the physical books in Spain are untouchable
The price is what is set by the manufacturer and you cannot run promotions or anything like that to "protect the industry". In my opinion this have a negative impact on the industry and customers
When Churchill sentenced us to 30 years of fascist tyranny because oranges grown with slave labor are cheaper
>  Roosevelt slept through the whole meeting
I´ve read somewhere that Roosevelt was ~~somehow sick (some even say Spanish Flu) and he had high fever and other sympthoms~~ which made him unable to focus on the conference, resulting in his decision taking being pretty much null
If true or not, we will never know
*EDIT: missed up with end of 1st World War and Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt was just old*
I´ve read somewhere that Roosevelt ~~was somehow sick (some even say Spanish Flu) and he had high fever and other sympthoms which made him unable to focus on the conference~~, resulting in his decision taking being pretty much null
If true or not, we will never know
*EDIT: missed up with end of 1st World War and Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt was just old*
That doesn't make sense, Spanish flu refers to the 1918 pandemic
Roosevelt was just in very poor health by February 1945, he would die just two months later
>we had our own war and our own fascists
Welp, they had already handed our asses back
But we definitely had more important matters to take care of, like a draconian fascist regime with a bomb-proof leader
Oh my god, I completely messed up
Thanks for clarifying
Roosevelt was probably just old and not in best shape
True
But it's a shame, what a wasted opportunity to give Franco a premature end at Nuremberg
Or maybe it'd make the allies lose, who knows
Any country other than Italy and Greece unemployment rates
I guess from the the UK, allowing its members to do a referendum for independence without getting our ass kicked
The working life of Norway
The efficiency and seriousness of the German Government, man the Spanish government is the least efficient thing there is
The bravery of the French to fight back when government/corporations/elites step on our rights or achievements
Urban planning of the Nordics (SPACING BETWEEN BUILDINGS), I hate how everything in Spain is built so close together when most of the country is empty
Dense =\= cramped
Road infrastructure of the Netherlands
Chouchenn and gallettes from Brittany, love them
Salaries from richer and more competitive countries in Europe
6% I see, not bad
Actually it's Catalonia but yep :(
Solution: Just abolish politics
Ancap gang
Corrupt politicians get rid of decent people not decent people get rid of corrupt politicians nono
I don't know if it's necessary
Europe already has more forest land that before the Industrial Revolution
Maybe we should focus on protecting what we have from fores and recovering what we lose now
Haven't they stopped doing that
Cubalibre
Now seriously, there are several and depends on the region:
\- [Pacharán]
\- [Licor 43]
\- Licor de café (Coffee liqueur)
\- [Orujo]
\- [Ron miel] (Honey rum)
We have so many
Aguardiente (Firewater) - Strong liquor made from fermented juice, grain or vegetables
Anis - Liquor made from anisette
Licor Cafe (Cofffee liquor) - Sweet chocolatey-like liquor from north-west Spain
When I went to Budapest I bought Unicum for my boyfriend
It really is an acquired taste
And the bottles look very nice
That's right
I just came to add [this map] in case anyone wants to know more
They are more regional than national
But we have a fuck ton of regional ones
I didn't know that either
I know most countries have their own gin and whisky though
Do you think English is hard
This question is obviously geared towards non-native speakers, but every answer is welcomed
I've seen this trend on the internet of native English speakers who think English is hard
It's not that I speak many languages, only English and Spanish, and I studied a little bit of French in high school, but I think English is quite comfortably on the easier side
Spelling is all over the place and reeeally inconsistent, but leaving that aside I can't find much else that is actually difficult
Verbs are simple, sentence structure is straightforward, there are no cases, no tones, the alphabet is simple
What do you think
English is definitely the easiest
No gendered articles, no bended verbs, oh and no separate form just to express feelings
As you might notice, I have a kind of love/hate relationship with Spanish since I have to learn it for school
I think it depends to which language are you comparing it and which is your native tongue
I agree which you that spelling is obviously the hardest part, but you eventually learn it
Being a student of Japanese I can say that English is pretty easy
I might be biased because I'm a fluent English speaker, but I don't think it's the worst
Sure, writing is really weird, but English doesn't have genders nor does it have 7 different endings for verbs based on who you're talking to, which can also changed based on the tense
Overall, I think it's pretty tame
I've tried to learn English and German and English is way easier to learn
I think it's stupid that writing has nothing to do with how it's pronounced
SO more stupid than really hard
That of course plays a part
When I was in high school I listened to music in English, watched all kind of media in English, from random YT videos to Top Gear, played games in English
For French I had to go out of my way to find content, which I never did, by the way
I was about to reply, from the inbox, that I wass surprised that you found Spanish easier
Then I clicked and saw your flair
Yeah, that's what I meant
I had to do it, but I never did
Not "I never found it" but "I never, or almost never, actually tried to do it".
Yeah, I was reading twitter earlier regarding the passing of Paulo Gonçalves and I understood everything easily
I imagine that if I had the interest, I could learn the phonetics with a little bit of time and with that I could at least get people to understand what I'm saying in Portugal
People explaining how they bankrupted because they sprained an ankle
There's a lot of MLM in EUrope as well
At least in my country I remember it being covered in TV shows of investigative journalism and the news a couple of times so I guess it's important enough to be talked about by mainstream media
Oh, MLMs are also in europe
Specially herbalife
They also (try to)  recruit people through job offers
Why do you assume everyone outside the US learn british english
Yep nobody likes superheros in enlightened europe
That was normal when I was that age
I still see it normal
Portuguese insecure nationalism is hilarious
Movies, Tv shows, music, videogames, other forums
Also I think some countries teach american english in school, just like in the US they teach mostly mexican spanish
BTW american english is as legitimate as the british one, and the most spoken
> ortugal is older and more unified than Spain and we beaten in wars multiple times having a Portuguese soldier to 5 or 10 Spaniards
More the "ortugal is older and more unified than Spain and we beaten in wars multiple times having a Portuguese soldier to 5 or 10 Spaniards" thing that portuguese users like to say every single time spanish protuguese relations are discussed
"facts" like folktales of a baker woman beating 10 spanish soldiers lol
The one I can think of is Beijing
In Spanish, the most accepted way to say it is "Pekín" and a person from Beijing is "pekinés", not "beijinés". If you say Beijing people will likely understand you, but our Language Academy recommends saying Pekín.
Apparently this difference is due to the different system used for the transcription of the Chinese alphabet to the Latin alphabet
I don't know if Peking is also used in English, I only heard Beijing
Other cities are quite similar or literal transcriptions like "London/Londres, Rome/Roma, Seville/Sevilla, New York/Nueva York, Cape Town/Ciudad del Cabo
English Channel = Canal de la Mancha
Falklands = Malvinas
Cornualles = Cornwall
Lovaina = Leuven
Amberes = Antwerp
La Haya = Den Hagg
Colonia = Köln
Copenhague = København
But the true winner is
Bolduque = 's-Hertogenbosch
It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize 'Antwerp' and 'Amberes' are the same city
In Spanish a lot of cities' names are changed so that they're pronounceable, like Aachen is Aquisgrán (that's a weird one) Moskvá (moscow) is Moscú, Bruxelles is Bruselas, Edimburgh is Edimburog, Köln is Colonia, Warsaw is Varsovia, Krakow is Cracovia
and a long long etc
An as a final curiosity, most Dutch/Flemish important big cities are still called by the names they had back when they were Spain
Like Maastricht is Mastrique and Leuven/Louvain is Lovaina
Brugge/Bruges is Brujas,  Lüttich/Liège is Lieja
And so on
I usually get confused with Geneva/Genève/Genf (Ginebra in Spanish) and Genoa (Génova in Spanish) because the name of the Swiss city in English and French is very similar to the name in Spanish of the Italian city
So if I read or play a videogame that speaks about Geneva, I must do an effort to not confuse it with Genoa
Same in Spanish: Varsovia
Yeah there are some Dutch and Belgian cities where there is a name in Spanish for them, thanks Charles V I guess
- Groningen = Groninga
- Nigmejen = Nimega
Wait until you google Bolduque
Oh talking about Warsaw you just reminded me of Wroclaw
In Spanish it's called "Breslavia".
> 's-Hertogenbosch
I guess the answer is "history", but how did that happen
In Spanish, the Thames is el Támesis
Funny thing is in Spanish is "Bolonia", not "Boloña"
Minga is pee pee in Spanish lol
I use maps
me because it's way better with offline stuff
But that's just me, not my country
(Spain)
In Spain CNIG/IGN (our National geographical studies institute) has two tools [Iberpix] and [Signa]
However, they are mainly used for cadastral consults and GIS data sourcing rather than for the regular citizen to move around
Our most popular hiking maps app, [Oruxmaps] and Wikiloc source data from there
We used to have two or three different mapping services, but Google Maps was way better at the time so they took the whole cake
Not really
However, people tend to use local apps to plan their public transport journeys instead of Citymapper or Moovit, although they also have Spanish cities
[Example]
When you are from a country where the name of the country starts with a different letter in your language than in English you have the same problem, the country list are usually a mess so even with the webpage in Spanish sometimes Spain is in the S written with E in the Spanish webside, sometimes in the S written with S, sometimes it's in the E written with S in an English website, it's always a mistery
Probably because in Spanish americans are called 'estadounidenses' (also 'americanos')
I understand them, it is not nice that one country uses the name of the whole continent only for themselves
Inglaterra se usa un montón. Reino Unido también bastante
Gran Bretaña diría que es lo que menos se usa, aunque sí se dice mucho "británico/a".
Post Data: Para traducir "usually" es más natural decir "normalmente" o "habitualmente" que "usualmente".
Me alegro mucho :)  Sigue practicando y cada día será más fácil
¿Has leído algún libro ya
Si lees un libro que conozcas bien, seguramente aprendas mucho
Wow really
In Spain it gets shortened as UE all the time
Interesting, what part of Spain are you from
I've only ever seen in written UE but never said that way
I'm from Madrid, but I did mean written
It depends
Is it peninsular Spanish or south american Spanish
In Spain they didn't respect the spelling and changed the song
So you basically get a song with letters that don't relate to the lyrics
In south america they say "Well in english it's said fun so
" and they spell it with F for "familia". U for "unión" and N as in "don't stop having fun anywhere".
Not all of us do, trust me
I don't think it's fixed and it depends on the teacher
I learned how to write in cursive first, then when I was around 9-10 switched to printed-like and nobody cared, then when I was 12-13 a teacher made us write in cursive again because "every time you lift the pen from the paper, it's a 0
1 second of life you're losing".
Now I write in cursive if it's notes to myself, and print-like if I know other people are going to read it
We learnt cursive and I also find crazy that some people don't start learning with it
Although a lot of people tend to mix cursive and printed
I still write everything on cursive
They teach first in uppercase printed-like and then in lowercase cursive
But that is only how they teach
The teachers generally doesn't care about the writting style afterwards, so people can write one way, the other, or in a mix of both (which I think is the most common case)
In elementary school we learn cursive until ~11 years
Then it's your choice
I don't even remember how I was taught to write at school
I join sometimes some letters, but I never join other letters
A supposedly good paella at the center of Madrid
British owned and staffed companies providing outrageous expensive services for British locals in souther Spain / Costa del Sol
Real examples: installing a TV antenna por 800 euros instead of 200
3 AC installations for 3500 euros instead of 2000, et cetera
Maybe overpriced stuff
However we do have some kind of touristic reputation and most people will not try to scam you
Doesn't mean it never happens but I've never seen or heard anything
Probably all the bad stuff happens at Barcelona
However as someone who is studying tourism in València listen to my wise words:
If you want to eat paella bear something in mind
A paella takes time
A good restaurant will ask you to make a reservation or to wait a few hours if you want one
If they don't do that and they give you one straight away, it's not a good paella
Most of the places already have paellas cooked and they will sell you that (they cook them all in the morning and just sell them at any time)
Always ask how long it will take
Anything less than 30 minutes or even an hour is not "fresh paella".
Great post, very useful
I guess the main problem in Spain is pickpocketing, so put your phone/wallet in a safe place and keep your attention on it them when you're in the subway or in a crowded place
Most people in Spain never touch others when walking, so it would be a good idea to check your pockets if someone ever bumps into you
In Madrid or Barcelona you have to watch out for people in motorcycles, because there has been an increase of people stealing bags/purses from their bikes recently
There are other scams made for tourists, mostly related to the lack of knowledge of our language (places advertising *zumo de naranja* for 2€ and asking for 5€ for orange juice, that is, the same thing)
As long as you stick to official tour guides you're probably safe though
Oh, and avoid taxis in Madrid
They're legal and safe, but they tend to pick the "scenic route" (taking the longest route so they can charge you extra)
They're fine in most of the other cities, as far as I've seen
Also, don't accept flowers or any trinkets from people on the street
They will come back for payment, although you can certainly refuse and give it back to them (or leave it on the floor if they won't take it back)
I've paid a 9€ pint in Paris, I think that one is universal XD
It's possible, you just have to find a restaurant in more hidden streets that aren't right next to the main sights
Well, I don't know this for certain, but I think my country takes care of my healthcare even when I'm travelling to other countries
It does in France and Portugal at least, but I'm not sure about countries outside the EU
Yes, I have the card
I suspected it wouldn't work outside the EU
It's a shame
I'll have to check my home insurance, maybe I'll be lucky and it would be included
Thanks for the tip
Well, I checked it out and it only covers the EU countries and a few other European ones
I do have to pay private healthcare if I go outside of Europe, if that gives you any consolation
One of the best tapas in my opinion is galician style octopus
Bed of potatoes, the sliced up octopus and lots of smoked paprika and olive oil
If ypu don't cook it propperly tho eating octopus is like chewing on a rubber ball
I didn’t even know this was controversial lol it’s super common in Spain
I don't think it is any weirder than any other kind of fish or seafood
The only thing I find gross is eating raw oysters, which, ironically, is something many Americans love
Different cultural beats, I guess
There are very common in Spain, but I don't eat aliens (including sea cockroaches, even if they are quite prestigious in my area)
On the other hand, a friend of mine used to do some research with octopuses and he always told how amazingly intelligent they are
When I asked him how could he then eat them, he answered "I eat them to get their powers
It's a very common dish in Northern Spain
It's fabulous served at galician style
I don't think it is disgusting but they are very intelligent creatures and I feel sad for them
I had them as a kid
But I've been vegetarian for almost a decade now, and it does obviously repulse me
One of the best things in this world: "Pulpo a la gallega".
Literally just had [octopus for dinner] its a pretty common dish in my region and i love it
I wholeheartedly agree
[Pulpo a la gallega]
I’ve tried it dozens of times when I ate animals, and I have never understood why it’s so loved and overpriced
Without paprika it wouldn’t have any flavour
Just like seafood
Any good squid or cuttlefish is way better than octopus
But raw oysters aren’t something alien to Spanish food culture at all
in fact it’s the way they are usually eaten in Galicia, raw with some lemon juice perhaps and a glass of Albariño nearby, aren’t they
Fried rings
I think you may be reffering to squid
Eat your fears
Own them
Squids are about as intelligent as octopuses
We call it pulpo a la gallega but yeah it's amazing :)
Yeah, it's cool, I love polvo a feira (octopus ala galician)
Those eucalyptus forests are previously burnt forests, they planted eucalyptus because they grow fast but they aren't good for the land nor they are the original trees
They are completely different products
I don't think you can compsre them
They are just both cephalopods
And i disagree
Good octopus has a very nice texture and great sweet taste
Not bland at all in my opinion
Same hahaha I never understood why is so loved
Yes, octopus and calamari are different
In Spain we eat a lot of both
They are not alien but they are only a common dish in very specific areas, mostly in the north (where you can eat them shortly after being caught), whereas you can find octopus basically everywhere in Spain --whether it's properly cooked or not it's a different story
Similarly, I like snails in sauce but I understand it's a very localised dish not everybody has tasted, and it sounds disgusting if you didn't grew up with it like I did
Don't you have octopus in your sea
If you don't maybe that's why
>they planted eucalyptus because they grow fast
They plant eucalyptus to make paper
it's a huge deal in Galicia
They are planted for paper
Well, not for me
I don’t think they have a taste, at all
The texture is just meh
and my family loves them, I have tried them at many different restaurants that were supposed to have great octopus
Don’t get me wrong, I could eat octopus if I was hungry and wouldn’t have anything else
It’s not that I don’t like it
It’s just flavourless: even the boiled potatoes under the pulpo have more flavour
I see your point, but I’m pretty sure that eating alive oysters is actually even more uncommon and niche in other oyster producing countries
Look at France or China, for example, they tend to be cooked
Same for the USA, eating seafood there is proportionally way more unusual and specific of certain locations there than in Spain
I’m quite sure that the average USA citizen is way more hesitant to eat raw oysters than the average Spaniard
Snails in sauce
So good
You're right, every summer they do
No need, it's Galicia
They pour the petrol
Eucalyptus are used to make paper because they grow fast
I'm not sure but they may be forbidden, Euskadi has always took really well care of its forests
That happens pretty much everywhere
Average there refers to the amount of seafood per capita that someone eats
Perhaps it wasn’t the best expression, but what I meant is that the amount of seafood eaten per capita in the USA is way below than in Spain, so knowing this figure and the idiosyncrasy of both places, if you pick a random Spaniard and a random USA citizen, the former is more likely to be comfortable eating raw oysters than the latter
I may be wrong though
Spain eats a LOT of Fish, 56
2 pounds per year per capita (The US is at 16
That's probably because even in Madrid, which IS 300km away, we eat It regularly
Fish has been carried for centuries to the interior
There's traditional cod dishes all around Spain, even 200km inland
in the coast they eat fish  non stop
In the interior we eat It very often
Yes but in summer temperatures are higher and it rains less
>And if you look at this map,
I find It hard to read though, as It doesn't take into account population
Most dark spots are just there bacause if inmense cities like los Angeles
Can you find which state has more consumption per capita (no Hawaii included)
>Oh, one more thing: In some interior states, like Wisconsin, fresh-water fish is regularly consumed, especially on Fridays
But that's not seafood, so it doesn't count
In Spain we Don't eat much fresh water fish
In The northern plateau it's more traditional, but most of the country sticks to saltwater
>The center of the US is over 2,000km from the ocean
Yeah, but in Europe 300km IS quite far
Bern (switzerland) IS roughly that far away from the coastline
Found out the spanish figures
Though
they're on spanish, so i'll just lay my thoughts on them
Basically the consumption IS very even along the territory with a peak of 28
64 kg per capita and a low of 19
04 kg in the peninsula
The outlier IS actually a set of islands
The canaries, somewhat ironically, have the lowest consumption per capita at 15
72 kg
So in conclusion, there DOESN'T seem to be a strong correlation between being near the coast and eating fish and seafood
In fact castilla y León a landlocked region IS second only to Galicia, while Andalucía, murcia and Valencia are all coastal and bellow average
Funnily enough, there seems to be a north/south divide with more consumption in the north, even in non coastal regions like Aragon and Castille and Leon
Edit: i looked a bit into It, and the coastal northeast, the region which eats more seafood in the US IS at 9kg per year
As i said, we eat a LOT of seafood
It used to be the town of Lepe but I don’t know if it is anymore
All of them
We have a lot of funny stereotypes for every region
The most common are probably the Basque country for brute force, Catalonia for being cheap and Madrid for bad tourists (*domingueros*)
I’ll say Murcia (it doesn’t exist)
Murcia
In Spain is Murcia
What the fuck is that
Spreading disinformation
I see
I lived there as a student for 6 months so idk how valid my opinion is but I thi k that the US offers a great job market and real good money if you study certain things but I would not move there, why
I just hate the "every man for himself" mentality in work
I hate the every man for himself in society
Nobody gives a crap about poor people
But my main reson is that life in the citties is just uncomfortable
I litterally needed a car to go to get cash to an atm
Public transport is a nightmare
I liked the people and the food and how vibrant the whole country is but i swear to god i was miserable when i had to take the car for fucking everyrhing
No, because of the Educational (getting loans in order to go to college doesn't seem right) and Healthcare system
Also I wouldn't be comfortable knowing that anyone can have a gun
If I had to move to another country because of unemployment or something like this it'd be an european country, Denmark or Germany most likely
If I became rich or I got an American girlfriend I'd make an exception
No and basically because of the same reasons already stated: impossibly expensive healthcare system, expensive universities that leave you in crippling debt, quite bleak vacations and worker rights
Also the fact that US americans tend to be quite US-centric and there’s a lot of ignorance regarding the rest of the world
Of course you have other wonderful qualities, concepts and life standards that are great but this would be my list of no-nos
Depends on which state and which job I’d have, given that US is probably an amazing place to live if you have a high income
Right now I am a university student and I won't need a loan because university is free
Guns are heavily regulated and the only school shootings I know about are the ones in the international news
When I have children, they will be able to walk to school alone the same way I did and the school won't lack funding or teachers
Once the US might have been the land of hopes and dreams, but for me this is long gone
International news showed me the harsh realities many people live in, like not being able to afford insulin or working three jobs at the same time
This could never happen to me in Austria or Germany
To be (brutally) honest, I don't think I would like living in the US, especially after joining Reddit
I mean, I understand that people tend to be their worst when they're anonymous users online, but I've seen a lot of bigotry, religious intolerance and passive-agressive attitudes from the users of the US in general
I'm not saying all US users are like that, but I think theres a trend
It's also a less safer country than mine and it offers me a lot less advantages when it comes to healthcare or public education
I do love some aspects of the North American culture, like movies, music, books or other parts of your cultural production, but it's not enough to make me want to live there, not in the long term
I could consider staying there for a couple of months to improve my English, but I think Canada, Ireland or any other english speaking country that I can think of would be better for me and can help me improve my language skills just the same
Edit: I'd like to add the xenophobia/racism factor too
People from my extended family has lived there for a while for work (engineering and high salary jobs) and they experienced racism for being Spanish (especially in airports or crossing the border to Mexico) almost in a daily basis
They look European, so I'd say it was more about xenophobia than racism, but it was still fucked up
After reading other comments, I think this one is going to be the uppopular opinion
I would like to live there, probably not my whole life but a few years
I think my opinion is biased because I'm software engineer and in USA you can have great jobs and career progression in that field
&#x200B;
Probably I won't live there because the inmigration policy that as far as I know is extremely difficult to get in but to be fair I know nothing about it
Information would be appreciate haha
if you mean like forever i wouldnt do it
Too many religous people, bad health care, too many fats, too much self centered, i dont like the work culture or the city desings etc etc
I wouldn't feel very comfortable knowing every person I see could have a gun
>people jumped out of their cars trying to get her
This is true
the comunity values for these kinds of stuff are unseen in europe
or like when everything is covered in snow and every neighbour picks a shovel
that's all great
&#x200B;
i was refering more to how self centered everyone is
to the level that nobody will question their friends life decission
And even in the workplace
IDK maybe it's just not the country for me
&#x200B;
And i lived in michigan
I'd been to Portugal many times
Life is nice there, just like in most countries of the EU
Not sure what you expect to prove by saying that
Spain is full of extroverts too :)
Not all states allow that, as far as I know
I'm curious, don't you feel attracted to other European countries  where you could have one too and be probably closer to your relatives
Well, you must have encountered weird Spanish people then XD
Italian people seem to be quite friendly too, in my experience, although maybe it is because Spanish and Italian people tend to have some mild sense on having a kindred spirit
>Since the 2015 ruling of the Supreme Court, all states
Oh, that's great
I'm happy that they finally fixed that
In Spain every mum and dad will tell you every little detail about pregnancy, maternity and solve every doubt you may or may not have
Socially is view as something natural and beautiful so it isn't a taboo
Churros/porras with chocolate
God I'd kill for some right now
^(Edito, a todos los que hablábais de comida antes de que comiese, que os den por c, me he hecho unas croquetas DPM)
unas croquetitas
Macarrones con chorizo too
Döner is the best confort food
Can confirm you do
As a foreigner being invited to a small town near Košice (don't remember the name sorry, well don't remember much to be honest) I was constantly offered slivovice, becherovka, Tatratea
after LUNCH
It was Sunday, just a regular one, and everybody wanted to get the foreigner wasted those little rascals
Please man I haven't eat yet have some mercy
I just ate that today, God they were delicious
Then imagine eating them in the middle of the night, being half drunk hahahahaha
(I can understand you don't like them, have you tried it w/out sugar
Here in my region in Andalucía, churros are not so sweet
We don't add sugar
Un cachopo me estoy haciendo yo :)
Los cachopos están riquísimos, qué bien saben comer en esa zona
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
• Netherlands -> Países Bajos
Literally means "low countries".
• Germany -> Alemania
Being the same because German in Spanish is "Alemán".
• Belarus -> Bielorrusia
• Switzerland -> Suiza
• Latvia -> Letonia
• Sweden -> Suecia
• Iceland -> Islandia
That's curious because it means "Island land".
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
Latvia: Letonia (i don't know why, possibly because of Lithuania
Belarus: Bielorrusia (Bielo i don't know where It comes from, but Russia because it's right Next to It)
Germany: Alemania (Because we call the Germans Alemanes)
Germany  - Alemania (from the alamani people, probably french influence)
Sweden / Swizterland - Suecia / Suiza (some people get these confused :DD)
Netherlands - Paises Bajos (Low countries)
Latvia - Letonia
Iceland and Greenland: Lose the meaning completelly to just Islandia and Groenlandia, wich dont sound anything like Ice or Green in Spanish
Islandia just sounds like "Island land" if anything
UK: We often just generalize "England" or "English people" when talking about UK as a whole
I think this happens in Italy too
We also call people from USA "Estadounidenses" (Unitedstatians) as "America" reffers to the whole continent here
Beijing - Pekín (not a country but i think its odd)
We used to call the area of southern vietnam [Conchinchina] and we have a saying that if something is very far away its in Conchinchina, but i doubt most people know the real origin of that word as an actual geographical region
Also during the Spanish civil war we called the I-16 aircraft "Mosca" (fly) because of the letters in the crates where its parts came ( Москва́ , Moscow)
I wouldn't say "Hiszpania" is different than Spain/España. It's literally the same etymology
In fact, of all those you mentioned, all of them have the same etymology/direct translation except Germany
Although I concede Węgry does sound really different, but in the end, it's a cognate of "Hungary".
Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe that uses the "deutsch" root like you  (D in German = T in nordic languages)
All Spanish cities have a bar (not related to each other) named "La oficina" (the office), so you can say you're at the office when you're drinking
There’s a hair salon in Luxembourg called ‘Ryan Hair’. Same colour scheme too
In Spain, the word "Arte" un the end, that means art and also is the ending referring "do to you"
Example:
soap store - enjabonarte
Advisory - aconsejarte
Parfum - perfumarte
Food - alimentarte
It was fashion some years ago
Too pretentious for my taste
I know of at least two bars in different cities called "Nottingham Prisa"
In some restaurants (specially in touristic areas) they charge fish and expensive meats (sirloin, etc
) by its weight
It's actually kinda shady tactic that some places do and is easy to fall for it if your a tourist
By law it has to be clearly estated in the menu
It happened to me in Asturias, Northern Spain
If i had to chose one it'd probably be the "Cantar de mío Cid" an epic and the first serious piece of literature in spanish
There are many other poetic works but i'd say this is the one
Probably "Poderoso caballero es don Dinero", by Francisco de Quevedo
Not quite a national poem, but it is the one most people can get behind as it is equal parts saddening and descriptive
I came here to comment on others, but i don't find anyone talking about the Kalevipoeg or Lacplesis and i don't know if i'm wrong and those aren't the national epic of Estonia and Latvia
In spanish literature Cantar de mio Cid
In valencian literature Tirant lo Blanch
Valencian literature is amazing and back in the day it was a huge deal (The Golden Age of Valencia)
>If i had to chose one it'd probably be the "Cantar de mío Cid"
I was about to say the same
I'll be that guy and say that's only for traditionally Castilian Spain (not the story, the poem and it's style)
Why not Cantar de mio Cid
I would rather say the Sigismund monologue in "La vida es sueño" by Calderón de la Barca
Me too, found a translation to spanish and i keep it like a treasure :D
i support this one more but probably becouse im from castille
Too honourable, not bleak enough
The last monologue of Sigismund is probably the most brilliant piece of drama ever written in Spanish
it was translated to spanish some years ago and got me a copy, i really like it :D
I had studied it and im not even german
Where i live we have an army of cats and many boars
let me tell you, being pursuit by a boar IS not fun
On a lighter note we also have rabbits and dears though they keep out of the resiential areas
We also see a couple of foxes every year and a few squirrels
There are lots of Birds of course and amongst them the iberian magpie ...which thrives in our town and almost nowhere else on Earth
that's what happens when you live by the campo (it's not the BEST translation, but lets go with  forest)
Only cats, birds and lizards
AND FUCKING HUGE ASIAN WASP THEY'VE COME TO KILL US ALL THE TOWN IS FULL OF THEM THIS YEAR WHAT THE FUCK
And don't forget they make holes through metalic fences so they're really hard to control
My aunt once hit a monstruous boar with the car, the boar just shruded off the hit and run away, but It left a pretty dent on the car
As someone who lives in Qatar, I won’t say too much on this because
you know
freedom of speech isn’t a right here
But yeah I agree with most people in this comment section
I hope there's a Corona outbreak exclusively confined to Qatar the month before the World Cup
Yeah it’s okay
I actually moved here with my parents when I was 8
They moved here due to financial incentives (high salaries, no income taxes)
However I am graduating high school this year and will move back to Europe
It's because they are boring and bland
I almost cried of laghter when a dutch friend told me the national dish was fucking smashed potatoes with vegetables in it and a bit of salt
I just always seems that norhtern cuisines are too simple and boring and without any spice
There are of course exceptions and a roasted whatever is always nice but there is no variation
Because Spain and Italy are kings when it comes to flavour
OP said southern european, not souther asian
Spanish food is basically the opposite
See, when i think about northern europe i was refering more to central europe (poland germany, netherlands, etc)
Ofc i hadn't thought about food growth in finland
And I still think about it as bland
Very little variation
No coulour, few spice
Idk maybe i'm just spoiled since spanish food is so varied
That's cool
But sauce it up a little bit
A finnish friend made me try it and sold it as like the best thing since fire hahahaha
It wasn't that bad, honestly
Not even close
Those are mashed potstoes
Spanish omelette is made bu frying the potatoes and onions and then mixing them with eggs and then cook it a little bit to shape it
It's rich and sweet and salty
Simple yet good
I think that's it
We've historically had access to a lot of things the Northern Europeans simply didn't. Specially in Spain where Arabs brought a lot of then exotic stuff like rice or saffron (hence paella among other things)
Or in the Balkans where they hd a lot of contact with Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine because of trade and later the Ottoman period
Also I'd say our food has way more carb (cereals, rice
) than Northern Europe's.
Yeah i like the stpry
And it makes sense with the potatoes and all that
Well i fuess it's a matter of opinion but a tortilla should not be bland
Only bland tortillas are bland
Try putting more salt
The first one is tortilla
The socind one is herecy (spanish inquisition intensiefies)
"Sacro Imperio Romano Germanico"
Usually call "El sacro Imperio"
(Sacred(Holy)-empire-roman-germanic)
(The Sacred (Holy) Empire)
In Spanish is the same as in Turkish when you translate it to English:
- *Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico* (Holy Roman Germanic Empire)
Sacto Imperio romano germánico
Here you have it
Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico
It sounds really cool
maybe as the romans had a lot of liks with the zone they consider that it was more relevant part of the name than the others
Would you say it's "usually" called *El Sacro Imperio*? I would say the most common way is *El Sacro Imperio Romano*, only omitting the *Germánico* part
Another note is that while *sacro* does mean "holy", the typical way to say "holy" in Spanish is *sagrado*.
I would say "el Sacro Imperio Romano" is more popular
na its better this way
now the people know that in Spain and in Portugal we call the HRE the same way
Sacro and Sagrado are the same in spanish, different addaptations of latin
Sacro is usually in "cult" contexts, while sagrado was the evolution of the latin word
Santo (Holy) is however different
And being Spanish catholic as fuck, we also have Sacrosanto, which is like Holy Sacred
Feels like an RPG item prefix, but essentially means that something is holy and sacred
For the first part i had see more the "El sacro imperio" than "El sacro imperio romano" but it will probably depend on the zone, and "sacro" is a quite hard word to define but i had search it in the RAE and is just a nother form of the adjective and its the same as "sagrado" so i will edit the post
too long to be used comonly in my opinion
TIL, never heard it english
The Real Academia Española is also trying to do it and failing
They can't add any fad word that is going to be forgotten next year
AFAIK the RAE only adapts their spelling to the spanish spelling norms - with hilarious results
They say that if there's an alternative in Spanish, you should use that
If there isn't, then you should used the adapted spelling
> They say that if there's an alternative in Spanish, you should use that
As it should be
Replacing words with no reason makes one looks stupid
It's natural that some foreign words replace "native" ones
Specially since speaking a second language is so widespread
It's happened before with words from other languages
In the 19th century it happened with French because that was the influential language at the time
Now it happens with English
I'm of the opinion that rules should adapt to speakers, not the other way around
sensitive/sensible
In Spanish "sensitive" means "sensible" and "sensible" traslates as "sensato".
You can't imagine the faces I get with clients every time a tell them their dogs tummy feels sensible
I teach English in Spain and they always jet ‘chicken’ and ‘kitchen’ mixed up
It’s so cute when they say they had a kitchen sandwich for lunch
When spanish people starts learning Spanish we tend to believe after means before and before means after
It's probably because before in spanish is antes, which looks pretty much like after
"In" and "on" I mix them a lot
Also translating subjuntive from Spanish to English
I always have a horrible time with prepositions in English
To be based on / off of
Take something *from* somewhere / *off of* somewhere
I was tought you can't have two prepositions together and then to hear /off of/ everywhere
The same for me
It's the same word in Spanish also, aislar
It was for me
In the same vein, assist/attend screw with me hard
For those who don't know, *to attend* = *asistir*.
To pull an Uno reverse card, I mindlessly said "atender a las clases" because of English influence
A lot of constipated students, then
Poland is very catholic so makes kinda sense
In Spain, and I think in the rest of the world as well, is the favorite pope of everyone
In Spain probabily Andrés Iniesta or Rafa Nadal
Antonio Banderas
Especially here in Málaga where I live, his hometown
Same in Spain
They are uncommon in Spain
Maybe the climate change deniers are more common than others, but still a minority
Not in Spain, AFAIK
There's propaganda and extreme beliefs, like in any other country –for example, people claiming that we lived better under Franco's dictatorship
But I haven't really felt any anti-science movement
Climate change deniers, for sure
Homeopathy must be a thing as I've seen several signs advertising "homeopathic doctors". Antivaxx are also a thing
Don't know about flat earthers but I'm sure there are a few as we have all of the others
No antivaxx at all
No flat-Earth believers at all
There are some climate change deniers though
We have a few CC deniers
For instance, [Federico Jiménez Losantos] a right-wing radio personality with a decent amount of followers, denies anthropogenic climate change
Not really, at least not with any noticeable presence
People who defend those arguments are just idolatrous of America who try to follow every trend thoughtlessly
Denying climate change would be to looking at a graph and say "That line is really not going up, is an optical illusion"
I had never heard about that, just searched it & wow
While it's true that we are still far from anti-science propaganda (like anti-vax people, flat earthers or homeopathy), there are some politicians that either ignore of flat out deny the problem of climate change
I'm not gonna throw names, but only a few parties are advocating for green policies, & a lot are not paying any attention to the issue
Anyways, this is something we'll see in these next elections
The war happened 80 years ago, 95% of the european population we have today was not even alive, and most of the people who was actually alive by then weren't even aware of what was happening because they were too young
So most europeans are over it already
At least in Western Europe I'd say we get along pretty well nowadays
The thing that has most effect on foreign relations nowadays is Brexit, and I wouldn't say it changes too much our perception of either Europe nor UK
As a spaniard, I think that neither of them have any effect on our country's foreign relations currently
However our own Civil War has still an effect in our country's interiors affairs and in everything that happens nowadays
Is there hate towards germans and/or russians nowadays there in Poland
Most of the people who fought that war is dead already or they were too young to remember
Little bit more complicated than that
Franco's regime influence can be noticed countrywide for sure, culturally and politically
Of course in Cataluña and País Vasco is noticed in a different way than in Madrid, Castilla or Andalucía (national pride vs reaction against nation)
What I mean about the Civil War influence is the division between republicans and nationalist people, still very strong
Actually the only time we spanish people agree the country has been united in the last decades  was in the recent period of success in football, winning two Euros and the World Cup in four years
Everybody supporting Spain in the streets and enjoying
The magic of sports
I really get confused in /r/relationship_advice and some others like these
It's like things there are so different that I can't relate at all
Like dating multiple people to see which one you want to be with, or moving in with someone after a month (or six), or 19 years old married and having kids
Such negativity against age difference in relationships too, it seems everyone there has to be with someone that is just their age or 2 more 2 less, and if not is bad/weird
I come from a culture where people start having kids in their early to mid 30, and most people don't move out of their parents home until then (or if they can get a job, since Spain has a huge problem with people getting jobs), and moving in with someone here is like a super huge step, and it's just not done in one month, or 6
If some friend did that I would be worried
Also age difference is not like super important
It only gets weird if you are with someone 20 years older, and in some case (my sisters) it's not even that big deal
People just accept it and move on
Also here being married at 19 is considered like teen marriage or something because you are not really considered an adult, even if you legally are
But these years, your late teens/ twenties are supposed to be about partying, going to college and trying things, traveling
Like, when my troublesome cousin got a woman pregnant at 18 at my family was really hush hush about it because some of them (specially my grandma) were ashamed
But the majority would feel very sorry for someone having kids in their late teens/early twenties because it is seen as losing your youth with kids
My cousin was really sorry about it, that's for sure
And if you are with someone, even a potential someone, you are not seeing other people
They would be mad
I would be mad
It would be seen as playing with someone
And the dating culture here doesn't exist as such
We don't go on dates, or date people like they do
We just hang with people and it just happens
Or Tinder I guess
But you don't do that programming on a date with the specifics of it being romantic
You just ask to hang on with someone to do stuff
I am not saying what things are better here, only that they are so so so different that their relationship advice is not relatable to me at all
Also I read /r/talesfromyourserver and these, and things here are really different too, since here no one tips, and it's not like waiters earn a lot of money
They also don't talk to people or do nothing except serve your food
If you want you leave some leftover coins, but that is all
Also you don't tip you hairdresser either, or the taxi driver (TAXIS HERE ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE
) or anyone i guess
There is no tipping culture, so when I read about it it's strange, but it also shows me that things are different in different part of the world
Specially USA since is so USA-centric
And there's so much drama
I feel the same that you
But to be honest, I have never believed that internet is a good place to ask personal advice
It's a double edged sword
It gives us access to people with a wide variety of experiences, but also to a lot of noise, lies and people whose authenticity can't be confirmed
It's the same with any kind of information
I this case you don't have even the variety element, since there is a dominant cultural filter
For personal advice, I prefer people I can trust, either friends, partners or professionals, depending on the case
On the other hand, I like to follow some of those subreddits out of anthropological curiosity
They are a great window to certain American cultural manierisms
I actually don't, but I do feel frustration sometimes, like when people go ballistic in the downvoting of a simple mistake or when some proven and documented facts of History are overlooked to fit silly agendas
I come here for the fun and the laughs and I am in the geek side of the spectrum, so this place is like a little paradise to me
Lots of subs to investigate, some subs to carefully avoid
Do you
What would change that
It may be so, but if you got to these subs all the posts are made by really young people, and a lot are married and with kids
Not saying is a general thing there, just in that sub
I am not trying to offend anyone
I just wonder how they do it
I mean, here when people start seeing each other are in that honeymoon stage and messaging each other all day **rolls eyes**, and if there were more than one person you could literally spend all day messaging people
Or maybe people here are just too needy and want all the attention
LMAO
Seeing it in Reddit is pretty normal
Just look at those subs and you will see
Let me add r/touchthafishy , please
Curiosity is a legitimate reason
I actually think I become a bit more passive aggressive and annoying
In the mood of "I don't give a fuck about anything" when I think in reality I'm really a shy guy who can get easily nervous
Idk if it counts as changing personality, but I find it harder to express anger and frustration in English than in Spanish, mostly because cursing in English feels so weak
I can't swear comfortably in english so its harder for me to get angry
I am way more polite in english than spanish
I feel it's easier to curse and I think I have less inhibitions when I change languages
Igen
Spanish government has created a ton of jobs as beach security
Basically people that remind you to wear a mask and keep the beach civil
They make about 2000€/month
Not to say that it isn't hard work
It's just good salary
Same here in Spain, and I guess everywhere as it not a pleasant job
I had a familiar that worked as a garbage truck driver here in Spain and he got 500
000 pts every month (about 3
000 €, and it was after taxes) when the national average were 100
000 pts (about 600 € after taxes), that was about 30 years ago
He worked all night and he switched for a "normal" job in order to not have to sleep all day and work at night
Nowadays the difference between the average national salary and the garbage truck driver is not as big as it was before
I think standing in 40 degree sun for 8 hours straight wouldn't be so enjoyable
I was at the beach yesterday
They just wander along the beach and let people know when they are too close
No parasol, just a hat
I didn't see a clipboard
Madrid - busy, tons of pedestrians and parkways, art and museums, nightlife, great metro system
Barcelona - built up, lavish hotels and shopping, distinct neighborhoods, also great metro plus trams
Málaga - tourists, beach resorts, major airport and seaport which means cruise ships
Sevilla - flamenco, foods most associated with Spain, gothic cathedral, only one metro line but there's also a streetcar
Granada - Alhambra, arabic architecture and art, hills, cobblestone bridges, narrow streets, impossible to drive downtown, you're going to walk a lot
I might add more later
You made me laugh
I have been in Ostrava as erasmus but spent several weekends in Kraków, Katowice and Wroclaw
Very good memories, a lot of "hooligans" as you say but no problem as long as you drink enough to get respect
Oviedo: partying with cyder
>Galway: \[...\] Spaniards
Could you explain this one
Hey, leave Palma out of this
Maybe former Yugoslavian countries
That's all
No further expansion unless Norway or Iceland change their mind
the later 30 years were mainly economic integration, comon laws
the next 30 years I expect to see deeper integration on military and diplomatic fields
The last steps to secure a no-war Europe
The brexiteers won't see that and this will be part of the reason why the UK will rejoin
The UK: We are going to leave and become a third country
The EU: *Treats the UK as a third country*
The UK: *Pikachu face* You are a bully
I think the key in a federation is that "we're one but we're not the same"
We don't need to be the same to be in the same country
I think we need a common foreign policy in order to be considered a confederation
Once that's a thing the EU would pretty much look like a single country from outside its borders, not matter how decentralized it's internally
You can ask the same question about Spain: why do we speak a Romance language instead of a Visigothic one
The explanation is the same exact one that was given in this post about France: the ruling class were a minority of invaders, but the majority of the population spoke Vulgar Latin
Same thing if you extend it to the 700-year Muslim period: they were the ruling class and, although there was a certain degree of mixture, the common people were of native Roman/Iberian origin, culture and language
I think if you think about spain you could find the answer to your question
Why do spaniards speak spanish and not arabic
Interestingly enough, in England the opposite happened: the Celtic and Latin speaking subjects ended up adopting the Germanic languages of their Angle, Saxon and Jute rulers
Similarly, in Muslim Iberia people at first spoke a Romance language inffluenced by Arab but in time they ended up adopting the Arab of their rulers
I guess that in this last case it was easy because people would learn Arab in their communities' mosques and there was a period of bilingualism
Portugal did have colonies well into the 20th century
Spain had a few with much lesser importance both economically and culturally
I'm definitely interested in what difference there are in Portuguese opinions about Angola and Mozambique depending on age
- Basque country (Basque names are easy to identify, even if someone can name his child a Basque name without being from there):
- First names: Iñaki, Mikel, Ander, Julen Aitor, Andoni, Antxon, Gorka, Iker
/Ainhoa, Amaia, Irati, Izaskun
- Last names: Goikoetxea, Etxeberria, Iraizoz, Odriozola
- Galicia:
- First names: Iago, Brais, Xoel
/Uxia, Naia, Diana, Icía...
- Last names: I can't think of a lot of Galician surnames
Bouxo, Loureiro, Bergantiños
- Catalonia/Balearic Islands/Valencia (I can't differentiate between these three regions, maybe someone from there can enlighten more):
- First names: Joan, Jordi, Oriol, Josep, Xavi, Carles, Sergi, Eric, Marc, Pol, Pau
/Carme, Dolors, Joana
- Last names: Puig, Ferrer, Serra, Bosch, Forcadell
Those are relatively easy, but I have no idea about the rest of Spain
There are some first names I can link to Canary Islands like Aday, Yeray or Yurena but they are pretty extended
Also, in Murcia and South Alicante there are some very common surnames with Catalan origins, like Verdú, Puigcerver or Cánovas, that I usually link to this zone
About the rest of Spanish names and surnames, I don't think I would be able to link them to any particular zone
Specially from the basque country are the easier but not all
here you have a list
There's hundreds of surnames in my country that straight up reveal where one is from
I would say the most blunt factor is language
If you have a Spanish surname you could be from anywhere in Spain, but if your surname is in Galician, Catalan or Basque, the options narrow
For instance Smith in Spanish would be Herrero, in Catalan it is Ferrer, in Galician it is Ferreiro
(I don't know about Basque, as it is not a Latin language and it is very different from the rest)
Once you've discarded the minoritarian languages and obviously the toponims (that is, the surnames that are just the name of a city or a mountain, in which case it is pretty obvious), and therefore their respective regions, you are probably left with a bunch of Pérez, Martínez, García, López and Hernández
You have absolutely no way to know where these people come from
There's many other surnames that you can guess, for instance, those that sound Arab are most likely from the south of Spain, where the Moors lived for longer than in the rest of the peninsula, between the 8th and the 15th century
Arab surnames sometimes start with Al-, like Alcántara, Almonacid, Almeida, Alcaide
But if you're not a Spaniard, I believe this is the furthest you can dive into the surnames thing
As for Spaniards, they'll most likely recognise regional surnames
My first name is of Catalan-descent, but it ONLY exists in my 3,000 inhabitants village in the Valencian Community
People in the neighbouring villages have their "autochthonous" surnames too, so if someone at my university has a surname such as Aparici, Magraner or Girbés, I'll immediately suspect they might be from my village's region
My second surname is very obviously Catalan too, so people know for certain I'm from the East of Spain, more specifically from València; it is also from Jewish ancestry and my mother's village used to be a Jewish village many centuries ago, so there's a lot of us with the same surname in the same region
Yeah
Here's very easy to tell if someone is from the Basque Country or a Catalan speaking region from their last name alone
While the same is true about Galicia, I'd say Spanish last names are very extended so it's harder to find purely Galician ones
People having Spanish first names but last names in the local language is also really common
It depends on the region and the parent's preference
For example, Julia Etxebarria Gómez (Spa+Bas+Spa) or Jordi Sánchez Pujol are names you can totally see (Cat+Spa+Cat)
Also Basque first names are somewhat popular outside the Basque Country even if you're not Basque
I guess because they sound cool and unique
As of other regions, I'd agree only the Canary Island have some weird names that you would never hear in other places
But last names are always Spanish
I don't know if there's even local last names
The rest of Spain is pretty uniform, I'd say
I'd like to add the typical last names from the province of Álava, normally composed of a patronymic and a place: López de Mendoza, López de Ayala, Díaz de Mendívil, Ortiz de Zárate, Ruiz de Aguirre
Just a thing, Naia is quite common in Catalonia nowadays and I think it's origin can be Greek or Basque where it is extremely common
Nowadays it is getting more difficult to supose someone's place of birth by its name
Agreed
Names and surnames of Basque, Galician and Catalan origin are easy to spot, but the rest not so much (at least for me
If you take the Spanish surnames and change the "J" (it doesn't exist) for an "X" chances are you end up with a Galician name
Another useful trick is changing "H" for "F".
> Catalonia/Balearic Islands/Valencia
Those are more Catalan than anything
In Mallorca for characteristic names you'll find suff like Tomeu, Xisco, Toni or Tomeu /Catalina, Margalida
There are many particular surnames: Quetglas, Rotger, Rullán, Llabrés, Amengual, Adrover, Salom
That I haven't seen outside
Then there's the noble surnames: Dameto, Zaforteza, Cotoner, Oleza, Ferrer de Sant Jordi
And the "jewish surnames": Aguiló, Bonnín, Cortès, Forteza, Fuster, Martí, Miró, Picó, Piña, Pomar, Segura, Tarongí, Valentí, Valleriola, Valls
(Many have non-jewish variants outside tho)
And in Ibiza everyone is called Torres, Costa, Marí, Tur or Escandell
Wow there are Tatars in Lithuania
There are still plenty of José Maria's being born
Naia is also greek, hence my comment
But it exists in other languages such as Hawaiian or Arabic
So hardly Basque only
It's in Greek too but with a different meaning, though
Haven’t lived in South Africa for 23 years
Been in Spain for three years now and hoping to never leave - it’s such a great country
I have left France in 2014, then lived in London, UK for a few years and really enjoyed it
Left London in 2018 and now I live in Barcelona, Spain, and I really like it
Spain worked out well for us, got jobs quickly and easily
Now my partner and I both work for remote companies so we feel privileged
We both spoke Spanish beforehand, the people are nice, the lifestyle is great, and the country is dope
Catalunya has a nice coastline (I like diving) and beautiful hills and mountains further inland
I do like Catalan culture, language and identity
I'm from not too far across the border and I feel pretty close to the local culture
The only pain point is the nonsensical bureaucracy
Getting the paperwork in order is a pain in the ass, especially compared to the UK
Not planning to go back to France any time soon
I might move there in the far future but that's not planned at the moment
It's nearby and I can visit often
Kenyan moved to Spain 4 almost 5 years ago, I go back at least once every two years to visit family
I do plan on going back but not to live
My story is a bit weird, i was born in Andorra, moved to Italy when i was 2 years old and then moved again from Italy to the USA when i was 13 years old, i currently live in Andorra and i love It here, i dont want to move out and i definetely dont want to live in Italy or the US again
Molta força! You can always come back home :)
Catalonia (or Spain) is a great place to live as long as you have a good job, it has everything you need to be happy: good weather, good food and friendly people
I lived 2 years in England and I made very good friends there but I had everything at home, I "had" to come back
Indeed
Malaga is just like Cape Town in that regard
Wine is arguably better in Spain, though
Left SA middle of ‘97
Moved to Bahrain
Lived there for around a year and a half, then lived in Qatar for 6 months for a project
Back to Bahrain for around 6 months and then to the U.K. Lived there for 17 years
Post Brexit we sold the house, I shut my business and moved here
The long way - we lived in the U.K. (got an offer and a work permit) for long enough to get a British passport and moved as EU citizens
Absolutely
We really wanted to live in the EU
Brexit broke our hearts because we had a great life there
Left a lot of friends behind but some visit
I’m working freelance now, but not in Spain - I work at the EC in Brussels
Children
We wanted them to have the opportunity to live and work in the EU
Growing up in SA meant 90% of travel required a visa prior to travelling
But Norwegians still enjoy FoM, no
The most important part for us
> Ah ok
Anyone can apply for a job in the EU though, whether you are a citizen of the EU, or the US, or India
But its obviously a bit easier living in the EU
A lot easier
Work permits are expensive
> Yes
My South African husband tried for a few years talking me into moving to the UK (way before Brexit was a thing)
He never succeeded, so we are still in Norway
Wise choice (in both husband and staying) :)
Bakamonoga, doitsu no kagaku wa sekai ichi
Neuken in de keuken
Not me but I have to mention it, a guy I met told me one of the few sentences he knew in Spanish was "Saca tus manos de mi pene, por favor".
My ex girlfriend’s brother taught me *Ich pinkle im stehen* and told me to say it to a group of my girlfriends friends
Anata wa suteki desu
It would be "*no tengo dinero*", but what were they teaching you in Spanish class
You have to add a little: “soy una puta muy* estúpida” is the literal translation :)
ColaCao - Powdered cocoa drink
And of course the food
when you spend a few weeks abroad and see some food from Spain its like you're back home, specially if its well done
Those look rather cool
It sounds to me like the lake scene of "Call me by your name"
A kiwi that knows Spain better than locals
[I like this video about Galicia]
This vlogger has a bunch of videos in general about Spain
This Guy IS amazing
Me too
Es el sindrome de españita, todos hablamos mal de ella pero todos la echamos de menos
I can't even remember the name
"Do it for your lover" perhaps
TLTR: Manel Navarro's do it for your lover
Never Chiki Chiki
A foolish Spanish man would say Chiki Chiki:
Chiki Chiki was a joke, it's a Spanish comedian that was sent thanks to a massive voting
That means Spain made a little light-hearted joke, we all laughed about it, and it was funny
The lyrics are stupid but at least they reference some situation from Spain like "Juan Carlos le dice ¿por qué no te callas
"It's basically a bunch of Spanish memes from the time
It was always good to be laughed at, but it was the intention
At least it showed we know how to make fun of ourselves and we have a sense of humour
Manel Navarro's "Do it for your lover" is however, the worst by far in my opinion
- I couldn't care less about Eurovision, but there are some people that do
Well, guess what, Spanish TV said their votes didn't matter (people voted for a different singer to go) and sent Manel Navarro and his awful song anyway
- Eurovision could be a way to show your culture and promote your country
Well, the song had nothing to do with Spain, it's not a Spanish genre and it's not about Spain
- At least you can have some good singers and nice visuals
No way, the dance was dull, the atmosphere was bland and the singing was terrible to the point it left a horrible voice crack (the only thing worth saving)
It's only good to be laughed at
but it wasn't the intention
"Do it for your lover". We wanted to get 0 points because the guy was awful but Portugal had to give us some
Hmm
All but the Chiqui Chiqui, that shit hit hard
Special mention to that guy who had a voice crack
Not the worse, but the most ridiculous
I honestly think that in 2003 your country got zero points due to the Iraq war
Eurovision is heavily impacted by politics
When I went to work to Poland my boss showed me that song, it was so funny and I felt some much second-hand embarrassment at the same time
Doohtjhooo it for your loooover
Damn you Portugal, why did you give us 5 points
We were so close to 0
> that was sent thanks to a massive voting
Our very own Chiki McChikiface
The best part is that Chiki Chiki won the vote in Spain to go to Eurovision thanks to a campaign by an online forum similar to 4Chan
It was then that Spain decided to change the way the voting system worked
I couldn't say which was worse, Manel or "[Que me quiten lo bailao] from 2011
Both are a joke, poor Manel was the punchline to a bunch of shitty songs, with the final off-key climax
We don't want to win Eurovision, it's clear that what we like is Eurodrama
Eurovision 2019, that couple that seemed to want to kill themselves
What was that
Do it for your lovaaaaaaaaa
Manel Navarro was the worst
With all my love I agree
not only that, he also was chosen by RTVE even when the audience chose another singer
Yeah
I don't feel proud of chikilicuatre, at all
Spanish broadcasting did something similar, they got pissed and organised a jury that bypassed the people's choice
It's pretty sad, it's just a silly circus, let the people have their fun at least
The problem is that Spanish national television doesn't take participation in Eurovision seriously and those of us who like the show are fed up with it
They don't realise that it is part of our image as a country and they send any kind of bullshit without investing seriously or considering the candidatures with professionalism
Chiki Chiki was a joke that started in a late night that ended up as something that can be interpreted as an act of protest: if RTVE is not going to take the festival seriously, we will vote to send the most absurd entry we can
I wish we had something like Melodifestivalen or Sanremo
I personally feel much more proud of Chiki Chiki than of the next twelve that have come after it
PD: To no one's surprise, this year we're sending another piece of shit
I SHIT shits more interesting than the two songs that have been proposed for this year
In fact, the melody is almost a satire of Daddy Yankee's Gasolina
They even had to change it a little bit because it was identical I think
Even worse,  Chiki Chiki was bad on purpose
Ok, I had the memory of being quite ok but now I have heard and
yeah, it wasn't politics
Iberian bros
Guys, WE WANTED A ZERO
We love you but we wanted zero
If you cannot win lose big
Agree to disagree
Pointless, apparently
Nope, officially Spain didn't fight in any of the two world wars
I think it's mainly a British thing though
No, the soviet invasion of finland
Which Finland lost, but the soviets lost a lot of soldiers
The Spaniard comes here too
That isn't unique to Germany though
Here I would say that Galicia is closer to northern Portugal than to Andalusia, for example
I wish we did use the short version *Chequia* because it's more practical tham verbose *República Checa*. But for some reason the younger generation has been taught to call it the former so now using *Chequia* sounds a bit weird
Yes
1its shorter
2 it helps us to save time
Like in Spanish: “Chechenia”
A lot of countries do it this way
For instance not everyone in Malaysia is Malay or not everyone in Laos is Lao
I guess the country just ends up being named after the largest or more influential geographical area or people group and that's the logic to it
Not too crazy :)
Aesthetically any of these two:
[The II Republic of Spain] flag has to be one of the best in Spanish History
IT'S GOT PURPLE FFS
I think the best is La Cruz de Brogoña (I don't know how to put the link, sorry)
Burgundy cross
That flag is so strong and beautiful
I liked more my flag when it had some purple
"My country"
I would go with the flag of the kingdom of Galicia since the middle ages
Might be too religious with the chalice and one cross for each province, but I like it
Castilla y León [flag]
[Asturias flag and the Castille & Leon flag] would look really unique compared to modern flags
I'm obviously talking about the visual taste, not the ideological one: the one used during the fascist regime of Franco and the Aspes de Borgoña (the flag of the Spanish empire and the conservative "carlista" movement)
I'm in love with the Cantabria labarum but it's historicity is disputed at best:
I think the best "Cruz de Borgoña" is the one with the [two headed eagle]
And the crown is substituted by a castle
If Spain becomes a republic some day the only thing I would want to keep the same would be the flag colours, I just don't like the purple addition
If i'm not wrong we have "celos" for jealousy and "envidia" for envy
"Envidia" is envy, and "celos" is jealousy
I think they almost have the same meaning, although one is more appropriate to use in different contexts than the other
This happens to a lot of Spanish words
Well
That's a tough question
So there's **roughly** 7 languages in the country I would personally consider: Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque, aranes, aragones, asturleones and Arabic
Spanish has **roughly** 14 dialects in the country (pretty few for our size and geography) [here is a map]
Catalan has **roughly** 8 dialects in the country
[here is a map]
Galician has **very roughly** three dialectal groups, with who knows how many dialects
**Roughly** 42
[source]
Basque has **officially** 5 dialects,  Though historically almost each town had its own dialect
[here is a map]
Aranes **I think** has only 1 dialect in Spain
Though it may have in France, if occitan is somehow still alive after french normalisation
Aragones has 4 **dialectal groups
** and **roughly
** 12 **dialects
** [here is the wiki]
Asturleones has 3 **dialectal groups** and **roughly** 12 dialects
[here is a map]
Arabic has 1 dialect in Spain, in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla
So all in all
8 languages and 40-98 *dialects*.
Edit: However the level of intelegibility varies a lot
The Basque dialects are almost languages of their own
Spanish in comparisson is **very** tame with its dialects
That's probably because there was a great effort done by the crown to estandardize Spanish
and also impose it in non native territory
That has ironically prevented other languages from doing the same
I think that's why the likes of Basque or asturleones have such astonishing variety for their respective sizes
Spanish
Only in Spain, one per valley
Spain has three official languages, apart from Spanish: Catalan, Basque and Galician
Then you have Valencian (some say it's a language, some say it's a dialect from Catalan), Asturianu which is a dialect from Latin (not from Spanish) I think
Then we have Aragonese, Extremeño, Andaluz and Murcian (I think all of them are considered dialects) and there are a lot of different dialects that I'm probably forgetting
I think it may be due to historic reasons
After Rome, Spain was very dislocated into different kingdoms and small counties, and a lot of centuries had to pass until there was a real union between those different territories
That may have led to those differences but I'm not certain
well yes
having take almost a whole continent gives you a lot of variety
There are more languages, like the Caló or Fala
They just don't have the same protection because of political and historical reasons
Here Gaelic refers to Scottish Gaelic, not Irish
How is it even possible with such a huge extension of land
Well, Franco's dictatorship tried it here  with regional languages and it didn't work
So it's still impressive in a weird way
Wow, that really shows their character, huh
Lol, Spanish has many dialects and Spain has many languages, everyone wants to kill others just for that
We have more than 10 dialects only in Spain and I'm not even talking about Catalan or other regional languages, it's impressive what they have achieved
Edited
Dublin (Ireland) usually attracts a lot of IT workers
I would also say that
it also has an increadible amount of connections, a large population very nearby, a strategic location, KLM HQ and Delta hub
Apart from that it's in the same country as the largest port in Europe (and second
In the world)
In other words, if you travel by plane a bit you're bound to end up in schiphol
I went there 3 times before visiting Amsterdam
It's usually called Pfizer vaccine, and sometimes you'll see the full name of Pfizer-BioNTech
Only 8 (spanish, portuguese, catalan, french, italian, english, russian, german)
Oh i forgot that merci was exported, so romanian and hungarian aswell
Edit: apparently hungarians don't use merci
spanish, galician, portuguese, french, italian, english, german, slovak, ukrainian, russian
Romanian, Spanish, Catalonian, Asturian (although it’s not considered an official language, so idk if it counts), English, French, German
Gracias, Obrigado, Thank you, Merci, Tak, Aitäh, Eskerrik asko, Grazie, Spasiba, Danke,  Dziękuję Ci, Ačiū
Edit: Had to check the spelling of the last two
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Catalan, German, English, French, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic
Spanish, Galician, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish
Not many, now that I count them
Spanish, English, Swedish, German, Portuguese, French, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian (Danish
Idk these three languages are dialects hehe), Russian
Spanish, Galician, Portuguese, French, English, Italian, German, Russian and Danish
West to east:
Obrigado
Gracias
Thank you
Merci
Gracie
Danke
Dzenkuije (I can say it but not write it)
Spanish, Basque, English, French, Portuguese, Italian, German and Polish
Oh my bad, when i went there i used it
I did as the guide said .
Not much
In Castillan it’s “gracias” and in Asturian it’s “gracies”
...non, now it's just a Matter of time
So, IS merci hungarian
>Merci can be a nickname for someone called Mercédesz
Hey here it's Merche, nickname for Mercedes
Thanks for your wisdom, dear Magyar
There's this Spanish fashion brand called "Desigual" that decided that to release [this campaign] for Spring and Mother's Day
Basically, a model dancing around while dressing up to go out, trying a fake pregnant belly and then poking condoms
The slogan
"You decide", way too similar to pro-choice abortion slogans
Everyone hated that ad lol
Anti-feminists claim that this was today's left way of thinking: putting women's desires over men's rights and whatnot
Feminists, the ones that the ad supposedly aimed at, said that it gave a frivolous image of women as man-eaters and completely missed the point of feminism
Fake wokeness at its finest
Obviously, they ended up pulling the ad
Rich chinese people
Ships, docks a ton of sea transport and commerce
Micro state that all it's city, extremely expensive, adored by some for how good they do or have implemented something that gets a headline, but at the same time super strict country like banning gum or porn
At first glance it looks like a nice country but you look closer and it isn't.
money swamp
Those 3 buildngs that share a roof, the floating stadium and chewing gum ban
Small rich country south of Malaysia, had a minor role at the beginning of WW2 when it was occupied by the Japanese (from the British)
And that's pretty much all I know
Money and gum
My 2 friends from there
Also the fact that they were both gay and never would tell each other since it is not well accepted in their society
In Spain, a common female first name is "Dolores", which literally means "Pain". There is a famous song about a naughty girl named Dolores that doesnt want to be called Pain but Lola (which is a short for Dolores, but also Lolita), and claims she is the one that goes always alone in the night of Barcelona looking for fun
Here is the song:
"Auxilio" and "Socorro" (both of them mean literally "Help" and are the words you are supposed to shout when you are in serious trouble) are also female first names in Spain
My village is one of the last that celebrate a festivity called "os maios", held during May
It welcomes the spring and celebrates mother earth
It's a pre-roman festivity that was almost untouched by Christianity
People dance and sing traditional songs, called "coplas" around fake trees that are built with plants, flowers, eggs shells and fruits peels (like oranges or lemons) ([this is a traditional one] )
There are other cities on the north that celebrate this as well, but as far as I know is a festival that is dying
Everybody knows about the "Armada Invencible", how the king of Spain tried to conquer England and failed but there's much more to this story
It's portrayed as a huge fleet attacking an innocent country with fewer numbers
Actually Queen Elizabeth had been attacking the Spanish ships that came from the Americas for years and she had filled her pockets with the Spanish gold
That's how Drake got knighted, by the way
The Spanish army then sailed to England in 1588, it was a large fleet but by no means it was the largest who had ever tried to conquer England (which is often said) like the French fleet in 1544
England initially had less ships but the Queen recruited private ships surpassing the Spanish fleet in number
The weather scattered the ships and an accident decimated even more the Spanish fleet decreasing their power
In the end, as is already known, the English fleet won against the Spanish
What isn't told, though, is that just a year later, in 1589, the English with Francis Drake on the head did the opposite and tried to destroy the remaining Spanish fleet but instead it was a complete disaster and got their ass kicked
1/5 of the English men died, around 20k soldiers, doubling the losses that suffered the Spanish with the "Invincible Armada". This is known as the [English Armada]
**Cartagena, on the east coast of Spain, attempted to become a U.S. state, and the north americans missed the opportunity to have their own Gibraltar
How
In 1873, during the First Republic, the cantonal revolt took place in Spain
A canton would be an independent territory, and the cantonal movement could be considered federalist
The curious thing about this movement is not the idea of wanting a federated Spain, but the type of territories that wanted to become independent
We have better known cantons or independence movements such as Cartagena, Sevilla, Granada, Valencia, but there were also much smaller independence movements all over the country
For example, the town of Motril, which at that time had only 10-12k inhabitants, declared independence, although it only existed from July 22 to 25, 1873
F for Motril
Violent armed conflicts with the republican government broke out, especially in Cartagena, which **tried to become a US state** to get rid of government aggression (obviously they didn't succeed LOL)
Finally, in 1874 the republic went to shit and the monarchy was reinstated, ending a very intense year for the history of Spain
Don't know who were the best sailors, but there's no doubt that the English have always been better at marketing
I will not be the one to judge the conquistadores from today's point of view, but just as we can agree that the Romans came to plunder gold, lead, iron, copper and silver from the iberian peninsula and we don't call it roman gold, I think we can stop calling american gold as spanish gold
I didn't know the English Armada, very interesting, now I want to know more
Ehh, yes, the mother of my best friend in primary school was named Socorro and I once saw her in the distance in public and started shouting her name without thinking it twice
Of course I felt the stare of everybody in there asking themselves why a smiling kid with no apparent troubles was shouting for help
Everybody except Socorro, who didn't notice I was calling her
Auxiliadora is another name meaning helper, (usually shortened to Auxi)
Anyway these names do exist but are very infrequent and practically non-existent between younger generations
From what I've been told, they are named after different "virgins" and statues/idols of Virgin Mary
You have la Virgen de los Dolores, la Virgen del Valle, la Virgen del Camino, de la Soledad
So girls would literally be named Pain, Valley, Path, or Solitude
They're names from different Catholic virgins, and usually go with María before (i.e. María Dolores)
Yes :)
is pronounced exactly as it is written
you re welcome :)
Yes, true
There were many reasons to do it
They didn't risk a fleet just for the lols
They were provoked by the English
Idk if it's 'common' to have Socorro mixed with María, I only got to know that Socorro in my whole life and I was just a kid
But if I remember correctly, the Maria X or the José Y thing was a thing only because during the dictatorship (although it could well be a longer tradition) the government wouldn't register anybody without the name of a Saint, so if your parents wanted to use any name out of the list of saints, they had to append another first or second name from the list, and José and Maria were just the default ones
Nowadays you can use any name for your kids
Well, I'm going to be more precise and say that the second "LL" (Llu**LL**) is pronounced more like a long L, but you can't escape from the initial LL
The name "Socorro" comes from "Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro" or a Virgen María del Socorro
So I guess that is why he asked
Some are (like Maria Dolores) but Socorro is usually standalone
We'd just have to bring [Basque Pelota] back to the Olympics
There would be good competition, but I think that Spain would have a good chance
Nah, partying until late would be our sport
Spain enters the chat
I think you forgot about us
An example: "me cago en la puta madre que te pario" translates to "i shit on the whore mother that bore you"....that's spanish for "fuck you".
"Basketball without the US" should be a sport
Here they don't open another cashier even if the building is on fire
It's exasperating, especially compared to others like Mercadona where as soon as there are two people waiting they open a new one
Nah, but Argentinians would be the REAL champions, they would say: "Me cago en reputa vieja que te recontra pario" along with other creative insults like  tobogán de piojos if you are bald or cementerio de canelones if you are fat
1 to 15
they like those chances
I'd pay to see that
But It has to be the maggot cheese
Escaños en Blanco, it's a party against the current political climate and system
There's no representatives
You just vote them and they don't get their salary, they just never go to the Congress, hence the name (Escaños en Blanco translates to Empty Seats
Surprisingly there are still Carlist parties in Spain
Long story short: Ferdinand VII of Spain dies in 1833, leaving a daughter, Isabella
His wife, María Cristina, becomes Regent until Isabella comes of age
However, some consider that a woman should not be able to inherit the crown due to the Salic law, present in French royalty (the Bourbon house), but not in Spanish tradition (neither the Trastámara nor the Habsburg), so they rally around Carlos, younger brother of Ferdinand
After a civil war, Isabella's supporters control the country, she reigns, and her son eventually becomes King
She is the great-great-grandmother of the current King
Some 180 years after the beginning of Carlism, there are still some parties that consider our current King to be illegitimate and instead support the heir of the Infante Carlos
Why
Well don't ask me
It's true that there are ideological differences (Carlists were hardline catholics, ultra-nationalists and absolutists) but we're in the 21st century, so
Teruel Existe is a somewhat normal party but it was made to spread that Teruel (a “city” in Spain) exists
I support them
>[Partido del Karma democrático]
>Their goals are the use of humour, drugs and free love as a mean to solve the problems
You reminded me how fast life changes
When finally the UK decides to go on Its main leader may die
I wonder if that will change anything or not
I have carlists in my family, it is very easy to explain
There is no logic in a monarchist mind
They learned it from their  parents, and their parents from the grandparents and so on
It's like a football team; you sing the songs, wear the uniform, cheer with your team etc
Yeah, I think they are the ones I'm voting in the next elections
India I think
You know, you couldn't tell from maps because of the projection, but when I last checked, Sweden has like 2/3 the surfice of Spain
Yeah Portugal
It's not as small as Switzerland but it's not bad
I knew a few guys from mali in spain
Yup
I was certain Sweden was larger until I saw the numbers
Idk, it's something very subjective
But I think of Portugal like France or Spain but I don't think of in it the same way as Switzerland, Kosovo or Panamá
That sounds amazing, we need to have some here, because so far I haven't seen it
Not sure about specific trains
I've never seen one taking the AVE or Cercanías
However, in the UK, there's at least one per train
València
When you live in that city you learn to love it and hate it at the same time in the best possible way
So many things are wrong with it, but you don't want to leave at all
It's a close call between Salamanca and Toledo but I think I have to say Toledo
Former capital, beautifully preserved old center with buildings from a variety of major architectural eras, near several wine regions, direct connection to Madrid by train
I don't know that I would want to live there though since there are a lot of tourists year-round but it is very beautiful
For everyone who has been in Granada, it is difficult to find reasons to justify any other city in Spain is more beautiful
Foreigners and Spaniards oftenly agree in this point, which is not the same than saying it's the best city to live in
I am in love with Vitoria which is in País Vasco
One of the best places to party, see cultural sites, and Pinxos
Tourist-wise, I fell in love with Seville
Baroque and Modernism at its finest
Also it's flat, has lots of gardening and you can eat well
Quoting a famous song here in Spain, *Seville has a special colour*.
Oh boe

The [first spanish astronaut] Carrero Blanco, a francoist minister that got killed during a bomb attack, and whose car flew over one entire 5 floor building
The best part is that, one girl got charged and [went to trials for making tweets] (read them, they are in national court trial)
After that everyone started making memes of that
&#x200B;
We suck at a lot of things, but most of our memes are pure gold
Terrible, spanish memes are about politics and celebrities, and Spanish people also see a lot of Latin American memes written with a bit of Spanglish sometimes and a lot of orthographic mistakes taken from Facebook groups made by 12 year old
Only a very few sometimes can be good and even become a English speaking meme too like the outstanding move meme
Some good Spanish memes can go to r/yo_elvr, the Spanish speaking me_irl
English speaking memes are way better
Our meme game is usually weak (aside from politics) but Spanish Twitter is wild
Spanish speaking memes are right there at the top with the English ones
It's the benefit of having a language with a huge amount of speakers: there's a lot of variety and exchange among many different countries
As good as Finnish or Polish memes might be, they can't compete with the amount of memes that Hispanics put out there and transcend to other languages (like "El risitas")
Some memes even have an indirect Spanish origin, like the distracted boyfriend meme, which comes from Spanish stock photos
The Hispanic meme scene isn't as big in reddit because we have our own communities, but there are still a lot of good things in Latin American subs and r/yo_elvr, r/LatinoPeopleTwitter and national subs like r/Mexico
spanish memes are all on recent political events
some girl almost got arrested for a meme of a dead dictator we had almost 100 years ago
the ones that aren’t political are just straight out stupid
english memes>
We really don't know where to stop, huh
LOVE these
PD: Nos han abandonado
:'(
You are going to be surprised, but he's not a meme here (i mean, we still laugh at it when we see it online, but we don't make things about him)
In fact, he's speaking spanish, and it's really weird when he's talking and there are captions in different languages haha
Was an option too, but I didn't want to flood the comment
Actually I'm gonna add it now, thanks for pointing it out
Our meme culture > Literally everything else
Nuestro humor es muy humor y mucho humor
>Nos han abandonado
:'(
A qué te refieres con esto
Any example
haha
I have a Chrome extension that converts units automatically to metric
Everything metric, if you're interested
I have just removed the recommended subreddits from my feed, no politics, no worldnews (cancer), that kind of stuff
And I try to clean my subreddit once in a while, so I actually only see content I really want to see, not something the algo want me to see
I follow the subs i want and unsubscribed from default bullshit
No, as other said, I only browse the subs I am subscribed to and I like
Some days ago I tried r/all and it was full of American stuff that I couldn't care less
It felt like Facebook, yikes
Also, I use Reddit from my phone with the app "Boost for Reddit" 99% of the time
I have never really liked Reddit in desktop
I dunno, call me youngling
Just out of curiosity, why is worldnews cancer
Yeah, it does that but I can live with it
Lots of clickbaity anxiety generating titles, lots of American stuff, Orange man this Orange man that
Since I removed it, my Reddit experience is a 7/10, 10/10 with rice
Really liked Mérida and its roman ruins
The latin class school trips were great
I can't imagine what it must've felt visiting a place like that as a child
I went to  Sachsenhausen last summer when I was in Berlin and we specifically picked the last day of the trip
It was such a depressing experience, but at the same time very necessary
We went with a guide and there were a couple of children with their families
Some were too young in my opinion
That being said, I've never saw Spanish children so quiet and attentive during a guided tour
Specific talks in school, biology class, parents and mostly, "the word of the street".
Parents and school
In Spain we are culturally very open with eachother
They gave us at 11-12 years
Agreed
Some important members of the Bagrationi dinasty, the former royal family of Georgia, used to live in Spain
Also, the presumptive heiress of the Russian Empire, Maria Vladimirovna, was born and raise in Spain too
I don't know if it can be called a "relation", but at the XIX century a region in Spain (Murcia) declared independence and started a war against the central Spanish government
They asked USA for help, asking the president to become (in some way) part of the states and use the American flag so the Spanish government could not attack and siege the city
More info can be found [here] in Spanish
Maybe the English Wikipedia has something too
Nicolás Maduro will blame any country for anything that happens there
The Canton of Cartagena was such a meme
They didn't have a red flag to fly over the city so they used an old ottoman flag they found
They also briefly considered declaring war on the German Empire because one of their ships was sunk in a skirmish with a German ship
Looks really quaint - and they make sure to tell all visitors about their [Finnish origin
I'm half Irish and half Spanish
Even if I feel a connection to Ireland and love Irish culture and history, I've lived in Spain all my life, and for all intents and purposes I'm a Spaniard
I don't speak English with an Irish accent, nevermind speaking Irish
I'm not up to date on Irish current events and politics, I just have general knowledge of what's going on, and what family members tell me, but that's it
If you asked me to choose in between my two countries, I'd have to choose Spain
Despite loving Ireland, I think it would be very hard for me to adapt if I wanted to live there long-term, and, I can't stand the weather lol
My father is from Spain, and my mother is half Norwegian half Irish/Scottish, I mainly identify with Spain since it’s my majority since my mother’s family is more spread out
I have three half Spanish, half German nephews in their twenties and they all consider themselves to be 100% Spanish
It's just they can speak German because their fathers happen to be German
I think two of them haven't even bothered to get their German nationality
Half English and half Spanish here
And my experience is basically the same
I would add that I enjoy a pretty nice hybrid culture
Like for example when it comes to food and all that
That's very interesting
I've read that accounts of the Irish outside of the pale made by marooned Spaniards from the Armada are valued a lot by historians as they give a lot of insight into the daily life of the people and their customs
Isabella and Ferdiand of Spain:
"Oh, man
The portugues control the african coastline to the india and we want the moneys too"
What
Who are you
A crazy captain that wants to go and see if he can find India
You want us to pay for everything
What
, The king of portugal, the most sensible nation in sea matters thought you were a crazy nutjob
Ok, here have three ships, what could go wrong
"Yeah, sure, let's allow this french dude march freely to Portugal
What's the worst thing that could happen
We all should do like in TV and never say hello or goodbye at the phone
Just speak ans say whatever we have to say
Well I didn't learn "Flugmaschine" from a teacher, rather my own search, but I realized no one uses it (except for me because I think  that word is cool as fuck)
Also my English teacher once said to me that "shut up" is a very rude way to say to someone that they need to keep it quiet
yeah I don't think that one is true
Waaait so you use the same pronoun to say "she sings" and "I kissed her" are both "lei"? In Spanish it would be "ella canta" and "la besé". I assumed Italian would work similarly
Then you have to say BS like "emparedado" and "cierra el pico".
We say «¿Qué tal
» here in Spain
"¿Qué tal
" is the standard greeting in Spain, sometimes followed by "¿Cómo estás?". It's like saying "How is it going
How are you
Pronto is "soon" in Spanish, which is not "make it quick" but could be understood as such in phrases like "vamos a terminar pronto/let's finish early"
That's exhausting
Personally, I've grown used to have less verbal interaction and gesture more, like nodding in acknowledgement instead of speaking a "Gracias".
I love this new power you just gave me
I just love germans, y'all are built differently <3
Pronto is "soon" in Spanish, so maybe it's not Italian after all
Is "l'" the contraction for "la" or for "lei"? Or is "lei" an indirect pronoun
For example, "le di un regalo" (I have her/him a gift)
«¿Qué tal
» is the shorter version of «¿Qué tal estás?», for me they both mean the same
I live in Madrid and here people use both versions, idk if it's a regional thing
What ThePedrolui said: "¿Qué tal
" is the shortened version of "¿Qué tal estás?" which means "How are you
"¿Cómo estás?" means "How are you
" too
Sometimes we use both, one after the other: "¿Qué tal
, ¿Cómo estás?" = "How is it going
How are you
Yes, it has basically the same meanings
We also have an extra meaning, when you meet someone and you say «¿Qué tal
», it means «How are you
Similarly in Spanish
Pronto = soon
To add to the confussion, "de pronto" means "suddenly" in Spanish from Spain
Valencia stays like that in English
But in French is "Valence" and I really love it
I like the names in Spanish but I don't like the names in English because they're literally just the neme in Spanish but pronunciated (?) wrong
Madrid - Mehdrieed
Barcelona -  Buarsselonna
Ibiza - Aivissa
I only like Donostia (technically it's not Donostia in Spanish, it's San Sebastián) because the pronunciation doesn't and Sevilla (Seville, pronounced "Sevil") because it's a similar name but with nicer pronunciation
I think "Sevilla" is OK but "Seville"? I hate the english translation
Also, i don't like the way english speakers pronounce "Toledo" and really like the way they say "Ibiza".
Mm TIL
At least in Spanish it's actually pronounced like the name
The spelling is "Sofía" just like the name
It's not wrong, it's just how the name was adapted in our language
We had to cancel it this year but I hope to see you around next year
Es que se escribe Sofía en español XD
Definitely Cuenca
When you don't know where, how or what, it is definitely in Cuenca
Everything around Madrid, Spain it's just Madrid + the Coast
Teruel or Soria
Most of central Spain could be included
Extremadura and any of the two Castiles
Castilla-La Mancha
It’s pretty much a bulls-eye with Madrid at the center and the coast at the rim, with everything else being pretty much in the middle of nowhere
Or you might say the middle of nowhere is actually in the middle of somewhere
Castille
What once used to be the most powerful european kingdom, now is a vast plain land with a few old people living there
pretty much all of inland spain except Madrid
Peple have been moving from there to the big cities for the last 2 centuries or so, so  its comparable to the Midwest in US
If you want to see truly desserted parts of Spain theres a [map]
Well, In Europe "the middle of nowhere" is smaller than in the US, but in Spain it would be probably Castilla La Mancha, Teruel or Soria
Extremadura and to a lesser extent Castilla-La Mancha
Not really, that's where we make people look to
Edit: but yeah, La Mancha and Extremadura qualify due to big towns and big lands in between
Teruel
The entire so-called [Spanish Lapland]
But yeah you say it because it's nowhere
like Teruel and Extremadura
But you could say la Gomera too
La España olvidada
Everything that hasn't coast or is Madrid
It's like an internal donut of nothingness
Literally
It was a big trend for people to move to from the inside of Spain full of emptiness and little towns to the big industrial cities
People tend to go back in holidays or weekends to see the family and relax
While there's plenty of programs to help save depopulated villages, in many cases its already too late
I've seen my own share of ghost towns
In a nutshell, eventually over time as people make their lifes in the city and the reasons to go back fade away, villages slowly dissapear
I would say in Spain the cycle is:
People from small towns -> bigger cities to study or work around the age of 20 +/- 2 years -> suburbs of bigger cities around early 30’s where there is more space to raise a family
Or in the case of some of my friends, move to the big city with possibilities, give up on city, move back to their parents house :(
This is true
However, thanks to the pandemic and companies opening to remote work, there has been a recent wave in the opposite direction, people moving from big cities to towns (I did)
As a native English speaker, I have never seen “a vibe” used in this context before
I kid you not when I say that once i saw a "beware haunted zone" sign in an abandoned village up a hill
I can't remember it
We were hiking around and a man pointed us in the direction
Now that I think of it he may have been a ghost
A moonbrella
When I worked close to Seattle, I read more than a few news articles about tourists in some parks taking pictures close to bear cubs
They made the news because Mama grizzly bear was always close, and  not very happy about it
How popular is rugby in your country
It seems like it’s most popular in the British Isles within Europe, adding France and perhaps Italy to the list
I was surprised to see it’s quite popular in Georgia
It's well known but not very popular
There are local clubs but apart from that I've never seen on TV a rugby match
Football outshines everything here
I've been playing for six years in Madrid
Not very popular but growing fast and it is moderately popular in some cities like Valladolid, and within the university students in Madrid
In my whole life I haven't heard of anyone that plays it
It has some people interested, but there isn't a huge national league
Europe is still a football centered continent
I had a Kiwi bid back in uni
Because if him I got into rugby
When I make it to NZ I have to watch a match at Eden Park
A rugby match and Six60 in Aotearoa
It’s definitely not popular in the U.S. in my opinion, but little by little more people are becoming aware of the sport
I saw a few Rugby 7s Championship matches in California in late February before COVID-19 started its world tour
I've met a few in Catalonia and Valencia, not sure if it's a local thing
Anyway, it's almost non-existent for the general public
There are some people playing in Asturias
The Uni even has their own team
But we're probably talking 100 people
And I've only heard about this because I happen to know two players
Otherwise
I wouldn't have
I buy UHT milk, so I only refrigerate it after I've opened it
As for eggs, yes, I refrigerate them too
It's not necessary but it keeps them from spoiling a week or two past the expiration date
Milk goes to the fridge whenever it's open at least once so it keeps fresh
(We usually buy brick packs of 6)
We always have our eggs refrigerated in Spain
I buy them non-refrigerated and keep the milk non-refrigerated unless opened and the eggs refrigerated
Chocolate out of the fridge
We buy pasteurised fresh milk so we have to put it in de fridge (because it's not uperized)
Sometimes we get it directly from the farms and if you don't boil it and put it in the fridge bacteria will make their work and you will obtain [something similar to yogurt] Some people here like it that way
Eggs don't go in the fridge and milk only goes in the fridge if the bottle is open
UHT Milk (the most common here in Spain and other parts of Europe) must be stored in the firdge once you open it (and must be consumed within one or two weeks), but until then I keep it out as  it takes a lot of space and can last in good conditions for months (in a fresh and dry place)
You might be used to fresh milk, which is sold already refrigerated and you must keep it refrigerated
Also you don't usually buy milk 6-packs as you would with UHT because it doesn't last for that long
Eggs in Europe are sold not-refrigerated, you can refrigerate they at home (I do so) as they last for longer, but once eggs are refrigerated you must strictly keep the cold chain
Basically the same for Spain
> standard fresh
Fresh is only standard in some countries
Here the standard is UHT
UHT is the the default and in many cases only option in Spanish supermarkets
I guess there might be historical reasons for it but I couldn't say
Now you can find "fresh" (pasteurised) milk in some places but it is still kind of a novelty
In Spain it is not common to have leftovers either, not only because portions are usually adequate and people try not to order too much, but also because the one thing that is actually frowned upon is not finishing your plate (for cultural reasons I can only especulate about)
I don't think it's ever been a problem to ask for a doggy bag but most people were not used to that
Nowadays takeout food is much more common and even normal restaurants offer some, so it's far less weird to take your leftovers home
I'm a bit taken aback by other spaniards saying is not common at all in Spain
I've done it my whole life, sometimes even being the waiter the one asking if I would like to take the rest home
It might be a Galician thing since a person said is mandatory by law here, but yeah, completely normal in my experience
Ps: Asking for a doggy bag if you go to each ribs (for the bones) is also quite common, even among older people, so i don't think it's something we implemented because of american movies
It's has been and still is unheard of in Spain
At least that's my experience
It would be ridiculous to try to take the remains of a tapa for obvious reasons
But it would also be a weird request for a regular dish, no matter how much you have left
The same here
It's a fairly new thing
I think it's a common thing in Southern Spain
In the Canary Islands the portions are massive
I had to teach myself to order properly
like, I can only do with a main and feel satisfied and full
The mentality of having and entrée, a main and dessert doesn't work here if you want to stay thin and healthy
I live in Catalonia and I've seen restaurants offering this to tourists, as it's well known it's an acceptable habit in other places
Not so common for locals, but I have no clue about the Canary Islands TBH
In some places the portions are not that adequate, I don't remember where exactly it was, but in a restaurant in Galicia with my girlfriend we ordered something like caldo for the both of us and they basically gave us a pot that could have fed 4 people at least
Obviously it was supposed to be only the first plate, so we didn't even eat half of it, the second was a bit more adequate, but still too much
Had a similar experience in Asturias with fabada, but that time I was so hungry I ate like an animal
I guess it depends on where
Here in the north it's quite common to have leftovers because the portions are relatively large
And yeah, it's normal to take it home, the waiter will usually ask whether you want to
Yeah, that's what I was going to say
I have taken leftovers home many times, especially pizza (there are some places where pizza can be huge), or with children
Obviously it depends on the food you are eating or the restaurant
Not really that common here in Madrid
I've seen it mostly when kids are involved
The general idea is that you ask for what you're going to eat, so if you don't finish "it's your fault" (???)
However as they said it's getting more common
I think there's a cultural divide somewhere In the north
In my experience, much closer to what the other commenter said
Unheard of some years ago, but became pretty common pretty quick and it is not unusual anymore
The last few years there's been talk about food waste it and people are starting to practice it
In big cities its become more normal and acceptable
Here in Andalusia it has become common in recent years
I do it sometimes and all restaurants has containers for it
But that's not a portion, they literally give you a whole pot so you can take as much or as little as you want instead of being served a generic amount
Nobody expects you to finish all of it, even though I'm pretty sure some people do or at least try
Asturias IS just on a different league
They serve as if you had one and a half stomachs
I've seen what I can only describe as monstrous cachopos
Forget the classic "for 2 people" you'd need a whole batallion to finish those
You seem to be a rational person, then
My friends in the north would be caught dead before leaving something in the plate
I went to a grill buffet with them and I was completely full half an hour before they stopped eating
I'm not entirely sure they are human
You are not expected to, of course (thanks God)
But the fact that you could eat it all is already quite baffling
I always wondered if they then serve what you do not eat from that pot to someone else or what happens after
Oh, no, I'm not one of the rational ones, that's my friends who leave food
I'll eat until I'm sick xD
Yeah
but that's not how it usually goes here
Rations are generally modest
If anything's left it's usually very little
Most times when someone asks for the leftovers it's down to kids, as they might not finish their food
Btw, That's how it generally works
There's plenty of exceptions
I've been served half a cow in Asturias (northern Spain)
However, you would just adapt and order less, rather than take the food home
There's also a culture of cooking your own food
Going out to a restaurant is seen as very especial
Smth you may do once a month (more or less)
There's also, at least here In Spain, a "scourge" associated with "not finishing your food". That's one other reason why kids are often the ones who don't finish
They haven't "learned" to order and eat "properly". So even if what you say makes total sense, it's contextualised by our take on food
>All through my upbringing i was told to think of the poor children in Africa when I didn't finish my plate
Same
[This one] it's QWERTY
&#x200B;
Adding more text so the post it's not deleted automatically without any kind of warning because it's to short, yes I'm making this post longer, just ignore this text
Well, could you find the differences
there are stuff like  the Ñ, the Ç and the ¡ ¿ symbols
QWERTY
With Spanish letter such as ñ and all the accents
When I have to write in French I use the Swiss keyboard (which is also QWERTY) because AZERTY or however is called it's just cursed
QWERTY but with the Ñ under the P and to the left of the L
QWERTY with acute and grave accent diacritics (`, the other isn't in my phone), ñ and ç
Same in Spanish
All of those characters are easy in the Spanish layout
Plus "ç", because of Catalan
Honestly, take the Spanish layout, add a "~" so you can write Portuguese, and boom, you have a Western Latin layout
Oh, yeah
We had some computers with Italian keayboards at my uni, don't ask me why, and at first I tought they were French because of the Ç.
Any particular reason why shift+letter doesn't get you the capital one
Is it because there are several accented letters in the same key
By the way, I realized that you can write letters like ã with the Spanish layout easily
Yeah, the Spanish one is good for all the Western Romance languages, or at least the major ones
Ouch
Then I don't see any advantage to your keyboard
You could migrate to ours and would probably have an easier time
Spain
Great Hispanic Emperor's and legions
I believe it was the IX Hispania
The iberian peninsula was the most romanized region in western europe besides the italic peninsula itself imo
The peoples quickly adopted roman language, culture, and roman names, to the point that all of the names of peasants recorded at the start of the Asturian kingdom were roman, and unlike the britons, they didnt just destroy everything and go back to iron age behavior when the roman empire fell
The 3 places I lived in with big Roman heritage took great care of it:
\- France (the motherland): tons of Roman stuff everywhere
I'm from the South and there is an infinity of well preserved "Arenes" (usually still used), aqueducts, bridge, path, and many cities have actually been founded by the Ancient greek or the Romans
\- Spain, same, tons of stuff everywhere
\- UK, England/Scotland was the very edge of the Roman Empire
The Museum of London has great content on London's Roman heritage
Not as much stuff as in more Southern nations, but until Hadrian wall, you can see a lot of stuff
Spain
Others have already commented on the linguistic, cultural and architectural influence
I want to emphasize that the legacy is still alive, Rome is still in the news every day
In my city, works began on a street in the old city and, as soon as they had begun to dig the ground, they found Roman walls used as foundations for the current houses, as well as other remains
Last month, some works in a hotel in the same city found other Roman ruins with objects
And this is something that is happening all over the country, we are constantly hearing about this kind of thing
1500 years and a few invasions later, every time we want to build something that involves a little digging, the past hits us in the face to remind us that we were Romans
And (now I'm going to generalize) people are happy about these discoveries, are proud of them and want them to be preserved, so I guess, deep down, we all feel a little bit Roman
You are right that the native customs did survive for quite a long time - this is because for a long time and in many places, there were parallel societies of Romans and Celtiberians, so there were holdouts of Celtiberian culture
Sheep herding is not very particular to Spain and is widespread globally so I don’t know if it’s any more “original Spanish” than the olive, which is cultivated all over the Mediterranean but seems to have originated in Italy according to current evidence
And many of the other things you mention are not relevant to modern society anymore
It’s hard to talk about these things because the history has been warped by nationalists from all sides, and also there is a generalised human desire that who were are today gets passed on in some form to posterity
So we want there to be traces of the Celtiberians in our culture
And maybe there are some, but there is scant evidence for it today
We know quite a lot about what spoken Latin sounded like and it was quite far from Romanian which has far more complex vowels
In terms of what it sounded like, about equal measure to Italian and Spanish, but several consonants were different (they had no sound equivalent to the English J or V for instance, the J was like a Y and the V like a U)
Lived two years in England, where to start
- Shaking hands with women when you meet them
That awkward phase when you see them again but you're not familiar enough with each other to hug them
- Awful eating habits - saw plenty of students pass on rice dishes with meat and vegetables for some fries, pizza and beans
FOR LUNCH
- Being absolutely wasted by 00
00, whereas that's normally when you leave the house in Spain
Also, how some English girls choose to wear very short and sleeveless dresses in January
- Also, the inane amount of make-up English women wear
It was astonishing, from a very young age too
- Ranking of schools
Immense pressure on teachers and departments
On a more positive note:
- Way more freedom in how to dress
Really stood out in sixth form and college
Many people chose more risky or alternative styles of clothing, and no-one bat an eye
I feel Spain is more conservative regarding this
- Bigger amount of vegetarians and vegans, also from a young age
- A significantly noticeable respect for public and personal space
People don't shout, push, have loud conversations on the phone, keep music to a minimum, avert eye contact if possible, but are also very polite and helpful if needed
As an extrovert I struggled with this at first, but it must be heaven for introverts
- A greater appreciation of local culture
It was easier to come across live music, art galleries and drama shows with lots of attendance
When people eat bad Paella in places that are not Valencia
And believe its a food from all of Spain
People shouting
Amsterdam-style coffee shops exist in Spain (well, not exactly)
There is a "loophole" thanks to which coffee shops are legal, or rather, alegal (but not ilegal)
Selling weed is illegal, but it is legal to grow for your own consumption
This means that you can set up a kind of "co-operative" that essentially works as a smokers' club
As long as you pay a membership (mine is a monthly one), you can go to your club and buy weed
In theory, you can only smoke it there
Since the weed is only sold internally to club members this is not considered as production with commercial purposes, it is grown for self consumption by the club members
All profits must be reinvested in the club - they work as non-for-profit organisations
The best part is that a lot of people have no idea these places exist
They can't advertise and normally you can only become a member through invitation by another member
From the outside, they look like empty commercial spaces
The weed and other derived products are more expensive than on the street, but there is a lot more variety and the quality is much, much better (there's quality weed on the street too, but it's harder to find)
Also, in these places they have music, boardgames, videogames, TVs, books
So you can spend your evening just chilling, playing some chess, or making new friends
S/O, ha
That’s a good one
"Te quiero"
"Te amo"
Although both mean "I love you", "Te amo" is much more meaningful
Whereas "Te quiero" can be said to friends and family too, "Te amo" is usually reserved for your SO
"SO, jajajajajajaja"
Translation:  "SO, hahahahahahaha"
Esa sensación cuando te das cuenta de que probablemente vas a morir virgen xD
Although "te amo" sounds very soap-opera-ish
I like to say "te adoro" (I cherish you), I love the sound of it
>Hit her with the tongue in the native I love you
>always works
Of course not
I'm left handed…
Well Franco stood in power until his dead, so
Obviously during his regime there was no democracy, not even ''fake elections'' and there was a brutal repression and social paranoia about communists, socialists and masonry  (Yes, the story tells that Franco tried to join a Mason group, they rejected him, and then he hated them so much lol)
Declare a war
Against ourselves
Being a traitor to the democratic republic and starting a civil war with half a million victims
Francisco franco
Thats not completely true, yes, he won the elections
An elections where the main opponents had been illegalized, imprisoned, murdered, had been exiled or were being coerced
So yeah, he won the elections, but a *democratic* election
Never
He betrayed all the monarchists that were in his side during the civil war, after promising them to restore the monarchy
And he kept all the power for himself for decades
To be honest I’m not sure you can blame any politician for Brexit
You guys voted out
I mean, he did restore the monarchy in 1947, it's just that he proclaimed himself "regent for life".
> the best the Nazis did in free and fair elections (despite voters being "nudged" by the SA) was only a bit more than one third of seats in the Reichstag
Which is still a fucking ton
This is funnysad (it has english subtitles)
&#x200B;
I wonder how a dane (or another tourist) would react after a stranger telling to use sunscreen at the beach
Yes, I read in class that in the Victorian Era having tuberculosis was seen as fashionable because it make the skin look paler and more fragile looking with the thin/ethereal enhanced look
Incredible how aesthetics and fashion standards can change with time
Did your skin ever got more used to the uv index down here, or you would have burnt the last day if you had been less careful just like the first day
Yeah, just google it
They also used things like arsenic as makeup to look paler
Yikes
In Spain we make jokes about each other's accents but I seriusly doubt anyone takes accents as something important
At the end of the day why should I care about how anyone talks as long as I understand them
Keep in mind Spain is a quite diverse country in the matter of accents and dialects
Each region has a different accent and some regions have even languages of their own such as Catalan, Gallego and Euskera
Murcian and andalusian accents are seen as a stigma, rest of Spain make fun of us, specially politicians and high class people
We make fun of each other
no one understand people from Galicia, Catalans speak like snobs, the Aragonese sound like farmers with diarrhoea and so on
As fellow Spaniards said, we mock a lot national accents
Andalucia (and some people from the Canary Islands) suffers the most from this
Andalusians have the known stereotypes of being lazy
Other accents live normally in peace
Now from my perspective, asian accents like Chinese are also mocked in a somewhat racist way but I would say that the general opinion has changed in their favor
(I don't want to say Spain is racist)
With Europeans we usually just make fun of the French:
***~~^(Una sena de picogteo)~~***
Latin America is so funny
Both sides are always in war regarding how to speak and both sides have stupid people
Except in the case of foreigner accents, there's xenophobe people in every country sadly
"We make jokes about each other's accents"
Can confirm, I live in Murcia
>In Spain we make jokes about each other's accents but I seriusly doubt anyone takes accents as something important
This is plainly and unfortunately untrue
Andalusian accent is still heavily stigmatized and looked down on
Add Extremadura too
But Galician accent is seen as uncultured, Catalan accent as effeminate, the accent from Madrid is posh, basque accent is coarse
If we Spaniards have a characteristic I would say it's to be assholes towards other Spaniards
My ex, who was from NRW (near Düsseldorf) would constantly make fun of Bavarian accent
and the accent from Cologne
it was so curious for me to see that Cologne does have a very different accent although it’s so near to Düsseldorf
I lived in a city with 200
000 inhabitants and its different boroughs had different accents some decades ago, that’s very surprising for me too
Not to speak about the German from elderly and the German from young people
I had a hard time in the hospital where I worked, and with some of the family members of my ex too
whereas I could speak perfectly with people aged 2 to 40
It’s not the accent that is considered lazy, it’s the people, different thing
And yeah, they sort of are more lazy than the rest but it’s mostly because of the heat so kinda understandable
What we think of the accent it’s that is fast, and not understandable
¿Murcia
¿Donde esta eso
Entre Teruel y Narnia supongo :)
> Catalan accent as effeminate
I have never heard this, for Galician I'd say people say it's rustic and that's not necesarily bad
Mexico with their "wey" "no mames" "la concha de tu madre" it's so true and stereotypical at the same time
I do and I'm catalan ;-)
Nah, Chilean immigrants are very uncommon in Spain (better economy than neighbors probably) and a lot of people don't recognize Chilean accent because we don't interact with Chileans often
We have more exposure to dialects from Argentina, Caribe, Colombia, Peru, etc
Argentinian is probably the most imitated one
But a lot of Spanish women find it sexy, lol
I’m catalan too and I’ve never heard of it
and I don’t think that the accent in Madrid is considered posh, it’s more of a *cuñao* accent :P
Nobody fucking cares
It's completely normal
Nope
It's uncommon but no one will pay any attention to you or judge you
I agree
I see a lot of people eating alone the "menu del día" in restaurants and bars for lunch and nobody cares
I understand that it would be weird in fancier restaurants, but in a McDonalds
That's why I eat normally man
If the judge considers you could flee then you're sent to preventive prison until trial
- It's a regional dish so maybe it's cheating, but [Murcian meat pies]  are amazing
It's a crusty pastry filled with meat, chorizo, egg and spices, and it's a very traditional dish that comes from medieval times
- Differen stews with [lentils]  [beans]  [chickpeas]  and many others
They are very traditional and nutritious, but I don't think they are usually linked to Spanish cuisine except for [fabada asturiana]  and [cocido madrileño]  and still I'm not sure if they are very well known
- [Broken eggs with iberic ham]
- [Bull's tail stew]
There's so many rice recipes apart from paella which are much better in my opinion
Arroz al horno "oven rice" is my favourite
Black rice with squid's ink is a also great
Really interesting, the same dish cooked with leftovers is called "Ropa vieja" also here, but it is made with legumes and meat
Wondering why is it given such unique name
There's a dish in Spain called "Ropa Vieja" made from leftovers
It is delicious
One of the best things I tried in the Netherlands
I would also add "Cargols a la llauna" (basically snails), from Catalonia
Either you hate them or you love them
Now I'm craving some fabes con almejas
What about asados
Not exactly unique, but it's crazy good
Of course, every spaniard knows what to eat in Segovia, but I think their existance is pretty unknown outside our country
Maybe you are referring to [torreznos]  they can be made from frying different parts of the pig's body, including the belly, and the [face]  The frontal part of the face is called "morro" and the cheeks are usually called "careta".
Snails are a rather common snack in bars in the south too
It is, once I checked it out and we extended torreznos everywhere we went
Funny enough in China they make a similar product (totally unrelated) but the Filipino version comes from us
[48] one of them in my hometown, [la llotja de la seda]
the Alhambra
The Alcazar
"Santiago de compostela"
Toledo
Burgos Cathedral
the number is
42 cultural
4 natural
2 mixed
and 4 are shared with Portugal or France
agh you guys have more and more
we had been in 3º place for years
Another one in my hometown,
We're third only after Italy and China
You could easily have three times that amount
>Zamość,
I went there and everyone kept asking me why
I liked It very much
>the Bizkaia Bridge
Been there, it's worth very much the visit
>Like the whole city
I mean the whole ancient city
It's still pretty big
Anything inside the walls of urban VIII
It's quite common
For example in Spain we have one about primeval beech forest which we share with 11 countries
In the adriatic i visited the same WHS 3 times, "Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar" in kotor, sibenik and zadar
Obviously It extends to Italy aswell
The debate if the potato omelette must have or not onion
It is more than anything a matter of taste, but it has divided Spaniards for generations
Our greatest debate is wether Spanish omelette has to be cooked with or without onions, also known as the incorrect and correct ways respectively
Also, we non-Valencians have tried for years to cook a paella deemed worthy by Valencians, so far without success
Spanish tortilla with or without onions is a reocurring one
There's a strong debate about what belongs and doesn't belong in a paella
Concebollismo o barbarie
Give me onion or give me death
People who like tortilla de patata without onion are just stupid, but I feel that this will eventually start another civil war
I'll bring preace between germans
Those are different dishes in Spain
Ensalada cateta: Potatoes, olives, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, tuna, onion, green pepper, vinegar and olive oil
Ensaladilla rusa (Olivier salad): Potatoes, peas, carrots, olives, tuna, hard boiled eggs, red pepper and mayonnaise
&#x200B;
Now you can make distinction too and stop the war
I can't believe you consider acceptable to put ketchup on pasta
my impression of Sweden as a civilized society is crumbling
Kvass is listed as an ingredient in the article you linked
My father from Madrid has sometimes been told that  his paella is as good as the best Valencian ones and I've grown up eating paella every time someone come to our house, so I kinda ended hating them
But when I went to Castellón (in the Valencian community) once and ate a paella there it was really similar to my father's
Cheese
In coffee
Are you okay neighbor
Im concerned
¡¡¡cereals first always
never pinneaple
there was even a meme here in spain with that while coronavirus striking hard
The meme was empty frozen pizza fridge on a market but pinneape pizzas hahahahaha
I'll give you a hint, not chorizo
this is so fucking true man hahahaha
fucking talibans
(for non spaniards, to call someone taliban in spain means to be extremist or really square minded)
There's none more blind than he who does not want to see
Onion makes spanish omelette worse
Onion usually makes everything worse for me because onion has a strong flavor and everything onion touches makes it tatse like just onion
Also, the real traditional spanish omelette is called TORTILLA DE PATATAS, not Tortilla de cebollas y patatas
Love you Austrian brother
Calla tonto
Problem is the texture
if u want it to be sweet just put sugar
Imagine not putting onion in your tortilla de patata
^This ^post ^was ^made ^by ^Cebolla ^Gang
Username checks out
Yes
I just did an image search and this is what i get
And even with asparragus
See
it's normal here, those are non-spicy peppers
I still had hope you could be saved, but I guess you're up to God now, or worse, the Italians
Imagine having good taste
^(The Sincebolla Gang^^TM will win this holy war)
In japan they put sake, (sugar) but obviously in the cooking process
u can do the same with normal sugar
Wow man, to know about "taliban ortografico" makes me feel amazed
If u cook wine it stays the sugar of the rice or the whatever wine u use
Hispania because Spain rhymes with pain
Thi is gonna sound wrong to you, but I really really wish the name changed to Espain
Most country names change a lot in translation, sometimes outrageously so, but they usually retain their first letter
I am used to thinking of spain as starting with E-, but usually when filling online info I have to check the list many times, unsure whether it will be listed among the countries starting with E- or with S-. It is very similar to the problem with USB drives, where you end up needing more attempts than necessary because of the insecurity
Also sometimes you will find things like Singapore, España, Swaziland
It is confusing
It is wrong
Please stop this
I actually like Germany (or Germania) and Alemania way better
I never really got the meaning of Deutschland at all
Was born in Germany btw, I'm both German and Spaniard
To avoid confusion
Maybe Magyaria since the -ia suffix is used for land
I actually love the name "Magyar", but you gotta admit the etymology for "Hungary" is also really cool (it comes from the Huns)
It's even worse in Spanish translations: you are Suiza and they are Suecia (and remember z and C sound exactly the same in those words)
I agree
The English spelling of Czechia is stupid
And Bohemia sounds much cooler too
Something that we can pronounce properly
That initial S is a pain in the ass
Another option is we get annexed by Portugal and become Iberia once again
I'd change it to "República Española" and enjoy videos of english speakers try to pronounce it
Even though no one uses it in Spanish the language is called "Neerlandés".
English spelling as a whole is just stupid sometimes
The fact that you write a word and then you just ~~invent~~ *make up* how to pronounce it tilts me in cases like this
Isn't the -nia prounced more like an "ñ"? (similar to English ca**ny**on)
100% agree but i would change it to tercera republica federal española xd
Von Vaters seite
You not having ties to the actual Huns doesn't necessarily mean the etymology of the word "Hungary" doesn't come from that name
Yes, it originally came from the Ungari nomads, but the "h" was preppended when they were confused with the Huns:
Por cierto, "invent" se usa cuando se refiere a inventos más bien
Normalmente en el sentido de inventarse algo, se usa "make up".
I mean, that's kind of a pointless point because "Czechia" literally equals "Bohemia". So "Czechia" is only one land in "Czechia" anyway
Many countries do it this way
The name of the country goes after the larger/more influential region/people group
Can relate
Now I can pronounce it if I try, but when I am speaking normally, my spanish accent comes back
Gracias
Supongo que se me ha pegado demasiado el slang, jaja
Not to be extremely picky, but I'm just curious about languages and phonology
Wouldn't you say that rather than -ña it'd be more like -ñja
Where *j* is a quick *i* (semivocalic *i*)
Oh YEAH
Nope, it doesn’t
Mit ein par Rechtschreib fehlern aber mit sprechen und verstehen habe keine probleme
Hab 7 Jahre in München gelebt
Yup I'm totally aware the Czech Republic is made up of historical Bohemia, Moravia and a tiny part of Silesia
Historial doesn't mean they don't exist today
I love french names, especially Adèle
But people would look at me super weird if I ever named my kids like that, instead of a spanish name
I would like to name my daughters as Hayley and Aoife but in Spain this could be a source of pronunciation issues haha
In spanish it would be like:
* Hayley: ailei (if they are really chavs) or Jeili (with a strong spanish "j" sound that I don't like in this name) and probably 90% of people would write it as Jeily
* Aoife: the chavs would say aoife if the read it, and if they hear how it sounds they would write Ifa (which is a supermaket in Spain)
I love a lot of Japanese names, and also some more Russian-ish like Natasha, which I absolutely love
But it would be very weird to name my kids like that here
I like the name Akesha, but I wouldn't name a kid that way
Yes, same here hahaha
Marina is a spanish nane too
Nah, It's not weird stuff
They're just talking about some poor kid that was named Son Goku da Silva
We definitely wear clothes with logos on them
HOWEVER, you friend might have perceived a big difference because people in the US (based on my own limited experience) wear them considerably more
In fact, it is something that caught my attention while I was there
I can wear a brand for their quality but if the logo is minimal I won’t choose that clothing
I’m not going to pay them to advertise them
As a Spaniard I can confirm people wear clothes with logos all the time
Might be less common than in the US (I have no idea), but you won't have to walk long until you see someone wearing something with a logo
I'm wearing a Columbia hoodie right now
It's not unusual to see, but I guess not that common like other brands
I'm sorry greeks, but Athens was a total shock
The city is
ugly in general (with notable exceptions) and i just didn't expect such a monstruosity of a city
However i ended up liking the city a lot not despite, but because of its "ugliness". somehow It just worked for me
I would go again no doubt
Beauty IS often overrated
That said you do project a very different image
France
I still have a mainly positive view of the country, but after following French politics, reading the history on things like nuclear tests and cooperation with U.S. imperialism, learning that it's basically the anti-vaccine capital of the world (per capita), and seeing some of the messed up stuff French multinationals get away with (again after I started following the news more closely), it isn't the magical place it once was in my mind
Despite losing that rosy perspective, I still want to travel France by train someday to visit its cities, see its history, meet its people, and especially explore its rich wine heritage
A lot of the things I love about Spain also apply to France so I could never hate it
I used to love the UK, since I visited it when I was like 16
The calmness compared to here, the weather (I love rain
yup
) the architecture, some parts of their culture and many other things made me fall in love with it to the point I was even planning on moving there someday, at least temporarily
Aaaaaaand then some of them ( ^(not all okay
)) thought they were still a great empire and  the people of other nations were taking their jobs, their fishes ,their women or whatever the fuck the were thinking, and then did a backflip and fall headlong to the ground
In the process betraying their brothers for about 73 years and losing a lot of things that made them Great in the first place
Just by thinking about it saddens me
Athens is like that kind of people that are rather ugly but have a charming personality that makes you fall in love
> Parisian clubs' problem with overpricing
This doesn't only happen in Paris haha
Have you Heard about the [Paris syndrome]
I'm sorry my friend but more than compliments is the biggest pile of tourist stereotypes I've read in a long time
Specifically I can't believe that the compliment for Spain, of all the things you could choose, is for bullfighting, I can even understand that you admire the courage of the bullfighters, but that the first thing that comes to your mind about Spain is that, is a defeat for us
These shows of animal brutality are fortunately in danger of extinction, prohibited in many parts of the country, and las corridas are mostly attended by a very specific type of person (right-wing, traditionalists and nationalists)
Its a minority tradition, not at all representative of today's Spain, and I am sure that most of us dont find it a compliment
You could have praised the paella which is also a great stereotype but at least it really tastes good
Edit: And I appreciate your intention to give a positive vision of each country, only I think that the example has not been good at all
idk how french restaurants works, but in Spain the kitchen only works during lunch and dinner times, if you want to eat at 12:00 or dinner at 20:00 you'll have a hard time in Spain
>It's just 4 million people packed together in grey apartments
Yeah that was the part that surprised me most, you don't Imagine how Big the city actually is until you get there
>(although the metro system us quite clean and organized)
Yeah
Though they did rob us at the metro
>Do they really project a different image
One friend of mine wanted nothing more than visiting Athens
So i would say they do, especially outside travelers
>like I felt the same when I visited Berlin,
Funny, i've been to Berlín and i felt the same, and i did like it more
Berlin isn't beautifull, but it's not as ugly as Athens
I would say it's just average, not really beautifull, not unwholy ugly
That's why i didn't write about It
Also their image isn't so romanticized
You kind of expect that Berlin is not beautifull but It is interesting
Madrid isn't beautifull either, there's beautifull chunks but i would rate the city along Berlin
However if you search "Madrid travel" you'll be way less mislead that if you search "Athens travel". I think it's because you have the acropolis to show and with some quick editing the Grey ugly boxes are out of sight
Search "Athens travel" in Google
Now, Imagine you didn't know how Athens IS
Kind of hard to tell how It is from the photos, isn't It
they only show Plaka and several ruins
That's the problem
However  i did find ONE photo which shows a bit more
>like being in a ghost city,
I don't know, it can be a bit creepy but It wasn't that bad
There's nothing like [Chiatura] Georgia
That's a Ghost city
Check out the [Paris syndrome]
I'd say it's because UK (and France and Germany) are political powers
And the UK is also a cultural power too (I've never heard of Australian or South African film industry, for example)
Its
more like the fact that (some, of course) of you put some fishes over several decades of cooperation, shared culture, commerce
Its just nothing personal, like feeling attacked, its something more like if a friend with whom we've live together for several decades just leaves because they treat him better somewhere else, except there's no somewhere else, and, as I said, that deeply saddens me
>Also Berlin is the only capital city in the world that is a net drain, our GDP would increase by like 0
2 percent or whatever without it
You're kidding
You're CAPITAL IS poorer than the rest of the country
> It's important to contribute to the spread of tourism in Greece to places other than Mykonos, Santorini, Athens and Crete, imo
Yeah, i Think so too
That Focus on the south IS really a pain
personally i liked better your forests in the north
However that's not all, the combinations are misleading
They Talk Athens and show the acropolis, then they show Santorini, until Athens looks in your mind all White and blue bellow the acropolis
I think i haven't seen one photo of Athens (from an agency) which wasn't awfully romanticized
In the case of Athens it's just worse because in some parts it's kind of a shithole
>Is 12
00 not lunch time in Spain
No, by far
I would say the Most common hour IS 14:00
When i ate at 12:30 in uni people looked at me as if i was alien
Dinner at 20:00 in a restaurant
pretty soon too
As he said you might run into problems
In Spain I've never seen or heard of a single building sharing  washing machines
I knew the concept from American shows/movies, but I thought it was just from US
These last 4-5 years I've seen some laundry places being open all over Barcelona, they're mostly used by immigrants, my guess is that landlords with cheap flats don't bother to put a washing machine anymore, but who knows, the general rule is still to have your own machine
In Madrid too
I thought it was because of the air-bnb boom
Washing machines are expensive and if you're going to have 10-15 groups of people per month in your apartment, it's only natural someone would fuck it up, so it's best not to have one and make them rely on laundry places
I'm thinking about sitcoms like Friends, Big bang theory
Scenes in the laundry room are common
I imagine, one for 20 families is not enough
Yeah you're probably right, your theory also makes sense
At least in Barcelona most of this kind of stuff is located at the center, thing is that both inmigration and airbnb can be found there, so it overlaps
Spanish wasn't mention in the post, but I'll explain them a bit just in case someone is interested:
—Termination in - ez: This termination means "Son of". So "López" means "son of Lope". And "Rodríguez" means "Son of Rodrigo"
—Surname with "de la", "del" or -es termination:  This means the place where the person is from
This kind of names are hereditary, nowadays no one makes himself a name
One famous example is "Don Quixote de la Mancha (Don Quixote of La Mancha)
But that surname is pretty rare, more common examples are "de la Rubia", "del Prado (of the meadow)", "montañés (of the mountains)"
There are other kinds of surnames in Spanish but I don't know what logic they follow
In Spanish the ending -ez is like the ending -son in English
Dominguez - Son of Domingo
Gutierrez - Son of Guti
Álvarez - Son of Álvaro
Fernandez - Son of Fernando
In Spanish many surnames end with - ez, Hernández, Martínez, Rodríguez, etc
It means son of Hernan, son of Martín, son of Rodrigo, of course now a days is no longer the name of your father but something you inherited but is cool
Also we keep the last names of both father and mother, we only really use the first 2, the first one of your father, the first one of your mother, but technically you could just keep going back and adding more and it will be accurate, i think i only know 4 of my surnames but if i sitted down with my parents we could keep going until who know how many, the order goes like this, first surname (your father one, inherited from his), then your mother(inherited from his father), then you could also add your father second surname(the one given by his mother), and same with surname of ypur mother's mother, and yeah keep doing that going back generations as much as you want
Also some of us have religious surnames like, iglesias(church), monje(priest), etc
Those were given back in the day to child without parents who were didn't have any other surname, we also have many surnames about profesions, it comes from you having some ancestor who worked on that, we also have people who has surnames which are just the name of a place, like Soria, Valencia, etc
I'm not really sure but i think those come from jewish who converted to chrsitianism, and of course we also have aristocrats surnames
Spanish -ez meaning song of
like: Pérez, Jimenez, Álvarez, Gutierrez, Gonzalez and so on
First off, i can't help you with those, if you want a spanish name i'll help you with it
However i love that you're taking your time to make the names make sense
So i wish you luck on your project
> Peréz
That'd be *Pérez* actually
-az also means "Son of" like one of my surnames, which is Díaz means "Son of Dio"
I actually know someone with that name
Not really, I would prefer to speak in my native language but thanks to the English language I can communicate with a lot of people over the world and learn a language is a good mind training
Yes, i want to share content in Spanish, one of the most spoken languages in the world, but still i can't do it outside spanish specific sites
&#x200B;
I'm almost biligual in english, but there is a lot of content in spanish that deserves credit
No, because I'm spaniard
Our language is also so important, so I don't really have a reason to be annoyed by that
Not at all
In fact, I love it
Apart from the fact that I think English is a beautiful and relatively easy to learn language (I’m not as good as in Spanish, but still I can have a conversation), it “forced me” (in a good way) to learn the language, and so that way I discovered that I enjoy learning and speaking several languages (now I am learning French)
Also if there was no universal language I wouldn’t be able to communicate, for example, with a German
If anything I'm grateful it is
On today's globalism, there is a need for a dominant language, be it English, Esperanto, or whatever
English is really easy to learn, its grammar is simple, it's easy to dominate on a day-to-day basis, and well, phonetics is hell but it's not like I have to actually speak it regularly so who cares
The fact that I'm a native speaker of the second/third most spoken language doesn't hurt either
No, it's easy to learn, specially the basics
It'd be way worse if we'd have to learn French or German
Yeah definitely
I kinda also feel bad abut, especially older, people who couldn't or didn't learn English, since it's really important
I for one like It better(America english)
Yeah, but most of the other options (french, german, spanish, italian or russian) are hard to start with and hard to master
English has a ton of words from latin roots and a lot from germanic roots, that makes it the perfect language for all western europeans to learn
Well thankfully some people can learn even when they're older but some people just can't. In Spain a lot of people have problems not knowing English, and we're a very touristic country
It's because they are lazy or because they don't care, it's just really hard
Europeans: No
Morocco: Yes, and we're being too good to them
France, Andorra and Portugal: Nah, we are bros
Gibraltar: Not really
That being said, a tax haven being adjacent to the poorest municipality in all of Spain is no mere coincidence
Morocco: **This one i find worrisome** and i'd be willing to bet their expansionist rhetoric is going to spark a major diplomatic issue in the next few years
Nope
I mean France invaded Spain a couple-three times in in the XIX century, but we good since they don't have kings or wannabe emperors anymore
As Morocco modernizes, it stays an absolute monarchy (I think) and they have tried some territorial shenanigans in the past
Also they push around their neighbours in Western Sahara, etc
So yea, living in the southern coast of Spain, Morocco is my most threatening neighbour
Then of course, the most threatening country for us, period, is the U. S., which has several military bases agreed by Franco and now we're stuck with them
Dear God, don't jynx it
MechaFranco 2
"The Papal States want to know your location
I don't think you understand what protectorate means
I use more catalan than spanish on a daily basis
I can speak Asturian fluently, as almost everybody in my fathers' family
The family of my mother is also asturian but they are from the capital of the region (Oviedo) so they don't speak too much
Asturian is a language placed between Old Castillian and Gallego, in the mountains in northern Spain
I'm Galician, though I'm a *neofalante* (someone whose mother language wasn't Galician but who began to speak it regularly in adulthood)
While Galician is relatively healthier than other minority languages (around half of the population speaks it as its main language, compared to 30% of the Basques, and almost everybody knows it), it's suffering a heavy decline in usage among the younger generations (only a quarter of the children population has it as its first language)
This varies between the countryside and small towns, where it's still widely spoken, and bigger towns and cities, where Spanish is the main language you'll hear, though it isn't rare to see someone speaking Galician
I do speak Spanish and Basque (I am from the Basque country)
I also speak English, some french a very little Danish
I speak Galician, as basically everyone in Galicia speaks Galician, especially in rural areas
Valencian (or catalán depending who you ask), its pretty much compulsory at school
You learn it until you end highschool
It's common to hear it all around the region
Spanish is used more
However everybody knows how to speak it and it is used normally by people from smaller towns, with your family or with a particular friend or group
You can talk in Spanish to someone and switch to valencian to speak to the person next to it if you know they use it as the primary language
Switching back and forth from Spanish to valencian and the other way around is extremely common and it's not seen as a bad thing to switch if the other person replies differently
Speaking valencian when the other person doesn't know and not changing is seen as something very rude however
Dude, it's good
That's some really interesting insight on minority languages in the US
To sum up, I use catalan at work and with most of my friends
If I go to a restaurant or a shop, I usually notice what language the staff use among themselves and go with that
If I had to adress a total stranger i'd probably use spanish first, but idk why sometimes you can just tell if they're from here
Sounds complicated explained like this but in reality i just go with the flow and what the other person prefers
I'd say the majority of catalan speakers are bilingual, so yes :)
It's hard to say
The tendency of the last decades is bad, fewer speakers each year, but current government in Asturias supports some kind of "officialization" and making it compulsatory in schools and public administration
I personally have mixed feelings about it, I want it to survive but not forcing people to it
One big issue is Asturias is a montainous place and the language varies a lot from one valley to the other, in just 150 km we have 5 or 6 "local variants" with their own vocabulary and accent
I am from central Asturias and for me western Asturian sounds almost as Galego, while easter one sounds somehow like Old Castilian
We also have accents in local places as Siero, Langreo or Mieres, and in other places outside Asturias as Laciana or Bierzo (Leonés)
The thing is they have "unified" the language, it is used a lot in local TV but sounds really fake and forced for us traditional speakers
It's very strange to hear (posh) people from Oviedo using it in that strange mixed way and almost telling the rest of us how to speak it properly, it's a non sense
But I guess that is better than than just let it die
Edit: spelling
They are fairly similar (partly due to both being part of the Western Iberian Romance family, and partly because of centuries of contact and imposition of Spanish over Galician has made the latter adopt some Spanish vocabulary), though Galician is closer to Portuguese (given that they both come from medieval Galaico-Portuguese), to the point that some linguists argue that Galician is actually a dialect of Portuguese (or Portuguese a dialect of Galician :P)
Depends
My mother is non-basqur and speaks Basque, but because she is a public employee and he gets bonuses for speaking Basque
But most people non-basque people won't learn it unless for professional reasons
Differently to catalonian, which is very easy to learn for a Spanish speaking people as both are very close language, Basque is completely different to Spanish, so it's difficult to learn
Yeah, my mother speaks Spanish and learned Portuguese and she understands almost perfectly oral Galician
We had some cool languages here in the south
In adittion to Andalusí Arabic we had "mozarabic", the language descendant of latin spoken by christians that lived in Al-Andalus
Both language died centuries ago, but at least they left some substratum in Andalusian Spanish
Totally right
I know morocco is one of the most moderate when it comes to Shariah Law, and that for the most part, north africa is much safer than latinamerica or even north america in some cases
I also know Egypt is the most populated arab country
and that some parts of north africa arent as dry as people tend to think, and seem similar to southern spain
Well on Spain we study the geography and a bit of history, specially about the Muslim occupation (I'm not sure if it's the right word), its contributions to our culture and the "Reconquista" when the Catholic Kings conquered the land back
Lately, there is some beligerant take on it, specially on Morocco, since they seem to test the limit of our borders (Moroccan army claiming more land and defying Canary Islands water jurisdiction)
Also there was a scandal about arabs saying something about conquering Iberian Peninsula again and Spaniards didn't like that a bit, so it boosted a bit the far-right movement
The average spaniard doesn't dislike northern africa, some of them go there on holidays, but honestly we don't know much about you apart from international media
Even though we're literally 14 Km away, we know fuck all about them, except for Morocco
Sometimes we even forget which one's the country next to it, Algeria, which is ridiculous considering it's literally across our south eastern edge
I know absolutely nothing of Algeria, other than France has many immigrants from there
In fact, I'm not too confident the average Spaniard could even tell you the name of the country
All we know is Morocco
We do have tight relationships from Morocco and many of us like to travel there, some to buy cheap immitation/counterfeit goods, usually clothes
We also know them for their crafts, like leather, fabrics, tiles, lamps, carpets
and some people appreciate and buy them
The cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which I remind you, are in North Africa, have extremely close ties with Morocco since it's literally on their doorstep and half or over half of the population is of Moroccan origin
The most common last name in them is Mohammed, so go figure
Other than that, we don't really have close contact with them other than what comes up in the international news or some issue about our countries' trade relationships or whatever
And well, there's a decent population of Moroccan immigrants: they usually run bazars (convenience stores) and many teenagers and young adults, along with South Saharan immigrants (actually they're usually the majority), come in pateras (small boats) smuggled in by mafias across the strait which is usually a very dangerous journey
Also, frequently we have waves of immigrants rushing over Ceuta's or Melilla's fence (yes, we have a "wall", like Trump's) or even through the main control points
Usually this involves a clash with police and people get hurt
Sometimes they get through, sometimes they don't.
We also have a huge issue with drug smugglers crossing from their side to our side, many drug dealers are of Moroccan origin (for obvious geographical reasons) and there's a bit of a debate on whether Morocco is "letting" them cross
I've heard they're pretty tough on drug control, but also that their police force is more prone to corruption, so mafias just bribe them to let them smuggle (drugs or people) over to Spain
All hash comes from there, everybody knows it
We've also had "armed" conflicts with Morocco on territorial disputes, mainly the [Perejil Island incident] but it's always pretty much meaningless clashes
I think fishing disputes as well
Oh, also, a lot of food comes from Morocco, like vegetable, melons, fish, shrimps
For me based on my experience, people from Morroco (specially berbers) are quite nice
I spend 9 days in the country and had a good experience
I know nothing about Algeria except for one taxi driver in Belgium that explained me how corrupt was the government
Tunisia is weird for me
I always wanted to visit it
I love its history and its supposed to be the best democracy in the region
However (I don't want to generalise, take this with a grain of salt) either on the news or on TV shows, they are always mentioned as problematic
Almost like it's stereotypical
I know mostly about Morocco, specially about their culture and story, not that much about the current politics
There's a lot of Moroccans here
We share a lot of story and even a land frontier, I guess that we're probably the European country that knows more about Maghreb
I know just the history that concern my country or my interest
Especially the things abaut moroco becouse what has affect them has affect us specially during the "Reconquista" and also the time in wich Spain had colonies in Africa and how Moroco retake the Spanish sahara and we give near all of north moroco (except Ceuta and Melilla)
I've been a couple of times to Morocco and our histories were intertwined for a long time, so I know a bit about their country's history and general nowadays affairs
Especially those that include Spain in some manner
Algeria is in contrast way more exotic
I know we had historic presence there, but very little more
I've heard about the Algerian war for independence against France, how France thought of Algeria as a part of France itself, and how that was very problematic afterwards
Lybia is uncharted territory, I know they're on a (triple
) civil war, that the French are in and that it used to be an Italian colony
Tunisia, I've been there, but sincerely I know very little about
I know Cartago was based there, I know they have one of the most moderate Islamic parties in the world
I know they were a French colony and
little more
Egypt I know a bit more, basically because of its importance in world history
So as you can see, the more eastern the less I know about
It also applies in the southern direction
I know next to nothing about Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan
Yeah, I may add Portugal
However I think France and Spain really take the cake
France because of the colonies and us because we still have a border with them+ we have a lot of history with Morocco
I think Spain, especially the south is quite connected with the north of Africa, mostly Morroco
We share a lot of gastronomy, culture, a lot of Morrocan and Sahara people lives in Spain
I know a lot of people that have been on holidays in Morroco or Tunisia and has to discover the country (not all-inclusive resorts)
Politically we all know how our Monarchy has always had a good relationship with Morrocan monarchy, so I would say most of Spaniards known at least that Morroco is a Monarchy, that Sahara is in conflict with Morroco and was once part of Spain
Lately I have noticed news about their armies and the danger some countries represent to us
I guess it's just political propaganda but I think there is an increasing tension /fear
We also know the "Reconquista" mostly forced people to convert to Christianity but they kept living in Spain so in fact our cultural and genetical roots are bond
Algeria is known as the country where our natural gas comes from lol
We used to own Oran, and there was a small Spanish colony in Algeria in the French administration era
Francoist Spain hid some OAS prosecuted terrorists
>Also you can find runic inscriptions in Hagia Sofia, Istanbul
I've seen them, I have to say it's cool af
Only improved upon by the fact that dandolo is somehow buried in the church, which I don't understand in any measure
And to think that more than half of Spain was a Caliphate for a 700 years
Edit: making up dates
[On African Romance]
>Spain so in fact our cultural and genetical roots are bond
Not really, when the moors were expelled they were expelled for real
The 800 years of ocuparion by the moors left no genetical traces in Spain
>The genetic data revealed that no significant African component remained in the genetic legacy of the population of the southern Iberian Peninsula compared to other Iberian and European populations, despite North African people living in the region for almost 800 years
The people with most north african DNA are the Galicians
Well, I'm not an expert in History nor genetics, I said what I said because it's what I have studied and because I know and I've seen lot of people that look alike North African people
Anyway, about the links you posted, the genetic study from Nature is focused in 146 people from Granada, Malaga, and Almeria, I wouldn't say it's a large abnd mixed enough measure but anyway the same article says there is a 8%-10% North African genetic influence in the south and around 20% in the north, I wouldn't say they were expelled, that's a lot of people and there were people too when they invaded the peninsula so, again, a lot of people mixed, they weren't replaced
About the ABC article, well, we all know that newspaper and its ideology so I expect it to be biased
The article talks about another study with another results from the previous genetic study
It says Galicia has the higher similarity with North Africans with an 11%, quite different from the other article's 20%.
I also don't understand why the newspaper talks about it in an amazed way, I mean, I have friends from Galicia and they look like North Africans, as their families and people from their villages
I only trust science, I don't trust biased articles or faulty studies so I don't think those 2 articles are enough to affirm they were expelled in the Reconquista, at least not all of them
Lol, it seems people do not like scientific (and objetive) papers
Well it makes sense that the genetic variation would be east to west because of the reconquista
We even have the same evidence with language, but somehow I didn't expect it
That out of Cadiz, Málaga and Asturias the closest ones are Asturias and Cadiz just seems so weird
That qualifies France as "north african empire"
146 people, and start going back in time 500 years
1 person has 2 parents, 4 grandfathers, 16 great fathers, etc
it may look small but they have hundreds and thousands of ancestors
And is Nature, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world
The other, is also a scientific study, the newspaper ideology is not relevant neither
I for one do
I was about to say the exact same
It's a common misconception that iberia and the Maghreb share much ancestry
when in fact they don't.
Well, it's usually told that the expulsion was either christian propaganda or temporal since people previously expulsed returned and just lied about their origins
Well, today science says they werevreally expelled and didn't returned
Yes but can't be sure their ancestors are from Granada or Almería, so they aren't relevant
Nature is prestigious and I don't doubt it's true what it says, I'm just saying it's just an study that we can't extrapolate to the whole country
The ideology is important as the writer interpretation of the data may be biased
10% of genetic similarity is a lot
Is too little
What's to be expected
What about other countries
The writer interprets it as little while 1 in ten people has root with North Africa is not a small number
Also Nature's article doubles the quantity from the one from Oxford so it seem there isn't enough data to get to any conclusion
So a north african empire colonized Indochina
> 10% of genetic similarity is a lot
Is too little
Is not higher compared to other european countries
>What's to be expected
Well, since they lived here for 800 it was logical to asume it would be way more, as they also say
also
> We are aware that 146 individuals is a small sample size for 3 provinces
Reduced sample sizes in population and evolutionary studies may underscore the allelic frequencies of certain alleles, underestimating the number of alleles that aredetected33,34
However, studies that have compared different samples sizes have revealed that, after increasing sample size, newly detected alleles are rare34
In this case, nearly all alleles represented in the allelic ladder are represented in the population and all alleles have frequencies that are similar to those in nearby populations
A bigger samble won't change the study much others studiess (referenced) say, when it comes to genetics
The Independence War (against Napoleon)
It was guerrilla warfare so it kinda makes sense, it would be like that one Assassins Creed game set in the 13 colonies
A game set in Al-Andalus or reconquista period in general would be cool too
If I didn't say the expansion and unification of the early Andalusian Caliphate by Abd Al Raman the 1st (who, remember, survived a coup that killed his entire royal family and crossed a continent until he reached the farthest tip of his empire, reclaimed it and helped it become one of the most advanced kingdoms of Europe), I would be wrong
Edit: emirate
It wouldn't become a full-fledged caliphate until 2 centuries later
- 1750 or 1810 Cadiz (colonies trade monopoly/Peninsular War)
- 1550 Seville (colonies trade monopoly)
- 1000 AD Cordoba (Just before Caliphate's fall)
- 1917 Barcelona or Madrid (general strikes)
Also Havana or Manila 1895 (independence movements before Spanish-American War) could be good
For Spain i'd say the middle ages, when christians, jews and moors lived alongside each other, it would be fun to see the different architecture styles in the different neighbourhoods
Other than that maybe Al-Andalus or el Califato de Córdoba would be rad
- Second punic war and Roman invasion (we would be the good guys)
- El Cid related era (medieval Spain and reconquista, really interesting period)
No good or bad guys
- Conquest of América
Bad guys
- Empire or Charles V and/Philip II and their infinite wars, could be centered on the Netherlands (we would be the bad guys)
- War of Spanish succesion
No good or bad guys
- Spanish Independece War against Napoleon
Good guys
There's a lot of obvious answers, la Reconquista during middle ages, the independence of the American colonies or other colonial periods in america, africa or asia, etc
But I'll love an Assasins Creed about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Anarquist Assassin's vs fascist (and maybe some communist) Templars
It would be great, but it's to recent and political to be a reality, they just don't want to mess with this kind of XX century stuff, unless it's WW2 or Cold War, then it's ok because the Nazis/Russians are always the baddies
1936 Spanish civil war
Endless memes would come from that and lots of juicy posts on r/spain

Canis o killos
nationally, the word is paleto, and it's used for people from rural backround with very little education
it's kind of unfair since their flaw is not being educated and that's not all their fault
&#x200B;
The most typical behaviour to a redneck or chav would be gitanos, that are spanish gypsies
but then we'd enter the racial things and i don't really want to
Canis

They can be found in “rough” neighborhoods, always have a pocket knife and sometimes try to rob teens or kids

Canis
[Gañanes]
I'm half gañan, can speak the language
The Flodder TV show was pretty popular in Spain during the 90s.
Them Brits
I though they meant chonis and canis but paletos makes more sense
I'm from "rural" Spain and we sometimes call the urbanites paletos because they have no idea how life is "out here".
The word that is equivalent to British Chav is cani or choni
Paleto is a different story
Example:
Yes, but a chav and a gopnik is nothing like a redneck or a paleto, and a lot like a cani
Well, chungo is an adjective, "un barrio chungo" is a dangerous neighborhood, "un tio chungo" is a dangerous guy
We went on a day trip to a little village with the school when we were like 12 and a friend said: "look guys, a cow
Like the ones in the book" hahah
Andalusia is very, VERY rural and it's a region famous for its low education rates but andalusia is not a word we use to offend anyone
In the 70s, "melodic music" like Italy (Nino Bravo comes to mind), rumba vallecana (flamenco+Cuban rumba, descending from Catalan rumba which was popular in the 60s. It shares topics with trap and rap, like poverty and . Los Chichos, Los Chunguitos) and some rock-pop too (Los Pecos)
In the 80s, the Movida Madrileña will rise up inspired from British new wave (Mecano, Alaska, Radio Futura, Los Secretos, Nacha Pop
) and rock (Hombres G, Loquillo
I would say glam-rock/synth-pop here in Spain
La Movida was the only artistic movement created in Spain in the 20th century, a a explosion of talent repressed during the dictatorship and released after Franco's death in the Transition
It was specially remarkable in the music area
I can have a normal conversation with Portuguese, however i do not understand the Italians
I'm fluent in English and Spanish so:
Italian: if you speak a bit slower I can pick up on 85% of what you're saying, reading is also not too bad
Portuguese: I can understand it less than Italian, but I can pick up on every other sentence (ish), reading in Portuguese is slightly easier than Italian
French: Spanish only really helps with the odd word, it's actually the French I was taught in school that helps me more
Spanish here
I can understand very well the Portuguese, Italian and Catalan
The French is different, I can understand some words but I can't have a fluent conversation as I can have with Italians and Portugueses
I've been in Italy and Portugal and I have had short conversations speaking in spanish and they answering me in italian and portugese
It was easier with italian than with portuguese but we still made it work
With french is absolutely impossible, I can only understand it a little bit when is written
Portuguese: I can understand completely written Portuguese, I can barely understand a 35% of spoken Portuguese
Italian: I can understand 65% of written Italian, I can understand a 50% of spoken Italian
French: 40% Written, 20% Spoken
Catalan: 50% Written, 25% Spoken
Romanian: I can't understand nothing of it
It seems weird
I think I will understand even more of Dutch, probably because my knowledge of English
Written, pretty well
Spoken, not so much
Portuguese: I can understand it with 0 problems, im from Galicia which helps a lot
Italian: 50/50 or less
French: I dont even bother to understand It, a whole another world
I can understand Portuguese and Italian if they are written
The pronunciation is very different
Italian: written 80%, oral 60%
Portuguese: written 85% oral 50%
Catalan (with some exposure): written 95% oral 75%
Galician (with some exposure): written 95% oral 60%
Romanian: written 50% oral 40%
French: I speak it, otherwise I think written 50% oral 30%
I'm a translator, so I may not be the average observer
I can translate from Galician and Catalan pretty confidently despite having no training in those languages
What
Is all the opposite for me
Catalan is very similar to spanish
Most people from don't have trouble understanding it
When I hear Portuguese I don't understand it that much
But written I can get everything
In Italian is the same, although I understand them a bit more
Idk which one is closer, I guess it must be Portuguese
Italian didn't get the influence Arab gave us during their 800 years occupation
I can understand a lot of Brazilian Portuguese
But Iberian Portuguese is a lot harder to understand despite me being from Spain

For Spain It depends on the region as Spanish is not the only official language
In Valencia for example school is in both Spanish and Catalan (% depends on school but 40-60 more or less)
For English our region once introduced a plan to have all public schools make the 3 language system
1/3 of all classes in Spanish, 1/3 Catalan and 1/3 English
It horribly failed because the English level of teachers was/is not good enough for teaching subjects in it
And that pretty much translates to all of Spain
Bilingual schools in foreign languages are mostly only private and more of the higher end of pay
Legally all people learn spanish and english, in zone where there is another official language, it varies, but they tend to know the regional language
But for english let's say not that much people can use it fluently
We have classes in Spanish and valencian
Each year we used to change the language of some subjects
Which was a bad idea as in subjects like biology I knew half the names of stuff in valencian and the other half in Spanish
We have English at school but it's a joke
Some places have French or German but it tends to be not compulsory so the people that choose them are more motivated and the teachers are good
I think there are many highschools that want to transition into a bilingual education but they are not ready to do it
As you said, the level of English is pretty bad in teachers
But I live in Madrid and many people i know have studied in a bilingual highschool
I studied in a bilingual school but I didn't do English, I did French (about 50% of my classe were in French) which is not as common
So introducing english is an "attack". Great
Heh
I don't know what's that
_sweats nervously_
Hello there, if we talk about them existing, out of the 17 regions we have at least 4 have a noticeable separatist movement, Catalonia, Basque country, Galicia, and maybe Andalusia and Valencian community or baleares have a very small one
But I think currently none of these movements are viable, at least in the moment as around 50% of local population supports literal independence in the strongest movement, we will see in the future tho, it's a daily topic in Spain, as we say only Spain can destroy herself
We have a weirdly large amount, but Catalonia is the one that most people have heard of
And honestly, I don’t think they’re going to be able to gain their independence any time soon
The two big ones are Catalonia and the Basque Country, with smaller ones in basically every autonomous community
Support for both of the large ones is under 50% in each of their respective regions, but it's close, so in a decade or a few we might see either of them or both becoming independent
well from what i can gather catalonyan independentists are pro-europe but europe doesnt want unstability and having even more countries to manage, plus for EU to position themselves supporting any independence movement would undermine the unity that EU seeks and most importantly, the country where that independentist movement is from would lose all trust in the EU
2, Basque country and Catalonia, They wouln't join the EU
Literally every autonomous community in Spain has separatist movements
It's quite complex, they come in all types of shapes and colours
Basque country has a movement
It used to be backed by ETA (aka terrorists) but now it's peaceful and not as strong anymore, I think
Even Andalucía has its own (very little, mostly unknown) independence movement
Yes, we do, I voted for them nor because I want independence from Spain, it's just how this country work, you have to make noise to be listened by madrid
They do, but it's not very strong
The Catalan one is the strongest now, then the Basque
The rest follow at a considerable distance
> their own economy, wich would be bigger and better if they didn't divide it with Spain
This reason makes no sense
Every country has a richer region that would be better off if it didn't have to send taxes to the poorer regions
At least theoretically, because once you factor in how things like trade would affect the economy, it's not so clear, but let's ignore that for the sake of argument
There are many self-identified leftists that support the rich paying more taxes yet don't want Catalonia to pay taxes to Extremadura
I think that's clearly a contradiction
I'm not sure if that your case, of course
In general, I'm in favour of them getting independence if they so desire, but not at any cost
It must be carefully planned and agreed upon, otherwise we would end up with brexit times ten levels of shitshow
But I think it benefits no one, all aspects of Catalonian culture are respected and promoted nowadays, independence wouldn't affect that whatsoever, and I think it's pretty stupid, in this day and age, to go around creating new borders and amplifying our differences instead of getting together and cooperate
It's not a problem to you but you also have Catalan independentism in your territory
>Abkhazia, on the other hand, was probably supposed to be a premier Black Sea tourism spot as it once was during USSR
That moment when you support a breakaway state in order to get some nice beach front
*Looks worringly to Germany and the Balearic Islands
I mean, all I said was that it used to be backed by ETA, which is true
Not that it was originated by ETA or that ETA was all there is to it
But your comment was far more informative than mine, so thank you for that
You wouldn't believe the amount of propaganda Spanish nationalism has put into linking both, and how well it's worked
He meant peaceful
Pacífico in Spanish -> Peaceful in English but mistaken with Pacific because of the similarity
> So and what about Spain joining Portugal under the Portuguese government, would you like that
Under a government that functioned like the Spanish government does
Sure, it wouldn't be a Portuguese government anymore, though, it would be an Iberian government, because Spain recognized different nationalities in the Constitution and said nationalities have great autonomy
Everyone does, Spain is de facto a federal state
> Are you sure
The Catalans voted for Carles Puigdemont and he was forced to step down, and that is happening again with Quim Torra, but he is refusing to step down, isn't that oppression
He was forced to step down because he made illegal things
There are plenty of separatists, many much more radical than Puidgemont, in several parliaments of Spain, including the national parliament
> And image if France annexed Spain, would you like to pay taxes to them
France is generally richer than Spain, but if there is a region that needs it, I already do through the European Union
And yes, I'd be in favour of expanding that
Same as with Portugal, if the government respects the culture of the minorities and it's not a situation of repression or dominance, I'm all for it
> Spain annexed Catalonia, Catalonia off course doesn't want to pay anything to they invaders and oppressors
Spain did not annex Catalonia
The Crowns of Castile and Aragon entered a personal union and, over time, merged into the same country, called Spain, that has gone through a lot of different governments and ideologies
The "Kingdom of Catalonia and Aragon" never existed, it was the "Crown of Aragon", which included a lot of feudal entities, including the Kingdom of Aragon, the County of Barcelona or the Kingdom of Valencia
Personal unions aren't annexations, far from it
Indeed, the crowns were merged in the 18th century
The Catalans were not sllightly more oppressed under Franco, they were very oppressed, and they aren't know
> Name them
He only did a referendum to see what the people want
So, he used public resources to do something that was outside his powers
That doesn't sound very legal to me
I'm not going to pretend that Madrid's management of the issue hasn't been a shitshow, but separatists are no different, especially PDC, which seems to be willing to throw the rest of us under the proverbial fascist bus if it befits them
ERC is showing that at least they care about the bigger picture and for that they have my respect
> He used Catalan resources to show something most Catalans wanted to be shown, he only made what the people wanted
And if the people wanted to crack down on separatist leaders
I don't think a PP, for example, leader of Catalonia should be able to ban the use of Catalan, through referendum or not
Laws are there to protect the rights of everyone, you can't ignore them just because you feel that more or less the majority of the population wants something
Yeah, laws can change
But not because the executive power wills so, laws have to be changed by the legislative power under their own rules
The Catalan parliament needs a 2/3 majority to change the Statute of Autonomy, it doesn't make any sense to attempt to declare independence when they can't even change that according to their own rules
That depends on what you consider upgrade or downgrade, but in any case that's irrlevant to my point
"Raven" and "crow", we only have "cuervo".
On the other hand, we have "buho" and "lechuza" where they only have "owl"
Wife and handcuffs are both esposa
Yeah, I find this difference pretty annoying in both cases
Also, "cake" and "pie" are both "tarta".
Existe también ponzoña. Aunque es una palabra ya antigua y en desuso (o eso creo)
Phonetics don't help
Is the book read or red
Correct
We do use prefixes to refer to this daytime nouns to avoid confusion, as in english
Example: if you want to say you'll do or have done something in the morning, it's "por la mañana" (during the morning), "esta mañana" (this morning), or soneyying similar
If you want to talk about tomorrow you just say it as a self explaining noun: "Lo haré+mañana" (I'll do it+tomorrow)
Do you have separate words for hunting birds like eaqle, different falcons too
If they dark and look similar, they are cuervos
I checked and it's a word used in Mexico for some owls
Don't remember hearing of it before
However is normal, they have a lot of vocabulary different from the spanish of Spain, like saltamontes and chapulin
TIL
Never have heard corneja before, thanks for the info
This is where the fun begins
Brits must be a bit confused about the gifts you give
In Spanish novio/novia can mean just going out formally (usually) to how you are right before you're officially married
So it can be a casual teen relation, or a fully developed couple right before marriage with 10 years of relation on their backs
Ditto spain
We need Romania and Portugal to confirm Latin languages agree
I know
I meant that it sounded like the basic colour, and looked like the other tense
Why create this confusion
Note that spanish is bad at this too , I'm not saying English is worse
Falconiformes (look like falcons) include those 3 words too: Águila, Halcón, and Buitre respectively
Plus many native ones and the names are more often about size than about actual evolution paths
>This is for me a mantra
I've heard so many times that thing about people learning languages only through video games or partly through video games
It does not work like that
Sure, you might have become better at it, learnt many words and idioms, your pronunciation and listening skills might have gotten better
But in order for you to improve in those areas effectively you need to study the basis of the language and get a proper immersion
Grammar books, classes, traveling, language exchanges and a years of practice
Had you not done that before playing games, you would not have been able to understand a thing
You won't become proficient with it either
>Learning through video games, music and media is just a ressource, a bit of help, but not a proper method
That being said I'm glad it has helped you that much
I identify with my city when I'm in another city of the same region, and I identify with my region when I'm in another region of Spain, if that makes any sense
I once heard a quote of someone along those lines, but I couldn't remember it
My region
The basque region is very different from the rest of Spain
My nation
I love the city were I was born and raised (Valencia) but my parents and grandparents are from all over Spain
So we never spoke valencian even tho we understand it, we never liked Fallas too much or never fell super tied to any valencian traditions other than paella for lunch on saturdays
My city always comes first
I have a deep sense of belonging to my land, the Mediterranean sea, my language and my culture
I consider myself a Spaniard too, but the truth is that there are so many different cultures and traditions in Spain that I can't feel a connection with the whole country, I don't think I know my country as well as to consider all of it a part of me
I'd say I'm Asturian, then European, then Spanish, but I identify as all three
City and region over country all the way
I can hardly identify as a Spaniard, although there's an undeniable strong cultural tie
But even in the event of considering Catalonia a nation, I still identify more deeply with my city and region
In this order:
Granada (city/province)
Spanish (Country)
Andalusian (region)
European
Mostly castillian but as that includes la mancha i would say that im from Valladolid then from spain then from a spanish talking country then from southern europe and then from europe, then as a member of the human specie fuck that alien
Most of the times I identify as Galician
Unless I'm not in Spain, in that case I'll identify as Spaniard, but if they ask where in Spain then I'll identify as Galician again lol
Edit: and if I am in a visiting a different city or town in Galicia, I'll just identify as being from my city
As being Galician in Galicia is kind of redundant, same way as being Spaniard in Spain is xd
It's funny that in my experience depending on what region a person is from they'll identify with their region or with the province/city in the region
For example I've heard many times "I'm from Galicia" (region) but you'll never hear anybody from Andalucía (region) say they're from Andalucía, they'll always say the province
Same with the Canary or Balearic islands, they'll usually say what specific island they're from
I still haven't quite gotten which regions favor which response and it obviously depends on the person but it's something I've noticed
Overall however I'd say people tend to answer with the province rather than the region
And the city if they're from a capital or major one
As a Spanish, is something like that
Barcelona and Girona usually don't have any good relationship, unless there comes Aragon to talk about borders, vall d'Aran, stolen sacred art during the war on yr
1036-9 and so on
Then they show the shield wall
Later on, they are again argueing
Huge regions will favor province over small or uniprovincial regions
Andalucía and the 2 Castillas are huge, so they will just say Toledo or Granada instead
Adding up to this, you won't hear a guy from Ponferrada say they're from León, so it gets even more complicated when "shire\* identity" comes into play
\* (for lack of a better translation to Comarca)
in a lot of countries is usually all against the capital (then all against all)
i find that in castilla and leon the ones that tend to say castilla are the one from the "capital" valladolid the rest no, special mention to Leon
I've found the "opposite" in the Canary Islands IME
They will remark they're Canarian first and later the island they come from
It might have to do with the fact that many people outside the archipielago don't really have a mental image for every single island, unless it's Gran Canaria or Tenerife, who usually say "Tenerife" or "Las Palmas".
i would translate county as condado wich is not exactly the same at least in my view
A family friend had a very nice house in a village nearby
It was on a very tall mountain and we went every Sunday to BBQ (Argentinian family lol) and hike
I loved those hikes and the dogs that man had
He had a car accident a few years back and passed away, I still think of him
I loved drawing, playing on my brand new pink DSLite and playing with my cat, Emi
She's a grown up cat now and very healthy, for those concerned about cats dying on this comment
For extracurriculars, I did English and swimming, I did martial arts too
I read a lot and my dad was always buying me new books that I started reading as soon as we left the bookshop and were all read the day after
When summer came I'd go to the beach everyday and swim and build sand castles
I loved watching movies with my parents, who never hesitated to watch the appropriate "grown-up" stuff with me
We also built puzzles, my favorite puzzle is a Klimt painting that is now framed in my bedroom
I also went for walks with my mom around town (a beautiful seaside Catalan town) and played around with my friends
Once a month we made it a point to go to Barcelona and have Starbucks and walk around and go shopping or to museums or art exhibits
I had an awesome childhood
I used to play with my toys at home on my own
Also watched some TV but not a lot, nor being a fan of any TV series
Growing up in South Africa, my favourite game was called ‘kleilat’.
Basically, we’d head to the local stream where there was a good clay bank and willow trees
You’d get a nice long piece of willow, a handful of clay then got added to the end and you’d launch it at someone on the opposite bank
Ended up with loads of bruises but it was great fun
"Queue" not because is hard but because I never remember how is pronounced
&#x200B;
also words with b/v. In Spanish they are pronounced the same (even when latin was the language of the peninsula, "Beati Hispani quibus vivere bibere est". Lucky Spanish for whom living is drinking)
Literature
Sometimes that word just feels like a tongue twister to pronounce
Edit: and if I try to pronounce it several times in a row, it just becomes a weird amalgamation of a non sensical mess of weird sounding sylabells
"Collaborativelly". I need to look at a fixed point and concentrate to say it well on my first try
As a result, most times I say it well but I look quite dramatic
For me the impossible one is "definitely"
I see 5 syllables but I'm supposed to say it in just 2 or 3
Impossible to my mind
There's no English sounds I particularily struggle with, and I'd say my pronunciation of words in general is decent (although there's surely a ton of words I mispronounce even slightly because English pronunciation is weird)
But what I really struggle with when speaking is vowels in general
It's not that I can't pronounce them, but I'm used to have only 5 vowel sounds like in Spanish, and I just confuse them relatively often
For instance, say I'm trying to pronounce "cup" and I might pronounce it like "cap", usually I just realize instantly and say the word again correctly
It's just something I notice I do quite often when speaking with my non-Spanish friends
Those are difficult for me because they are the same words in Spanish and my mind goes to the default set up
Sometimes they sound the same for me  when spoken fast
Worcestershire Sauce
"Gewfwend", "lichualy" and "weldwide" are waaaaaay easier for me to spell
People think that coming from a country in which we roll our Rs it would be easier for us to spell these words, but our Rs are never surrounded by other consonants and then followed by even more Rs
You just taught me how to say it
Nah, in Spanish is easy, ardilla
&#x200B;
Kiwi (not kibi, please, dont be my yaya)
For me it's not about the words itself, it is more about similar words: cup, cap; Beer, bear, beard, bird, bare (...)
I just say "line".
I have internalized the v sound and I have no problem with now, I did when I started speaking English
However I still have problems with the vowels when they are not the Spanish sounds like in bus or focus, those are “a” sound but holy molly I get weird a’s.
Also the y and ll sounds
pfff
li cher chuer
Aprox
Rural rur
ok I see what you did there
My English friends usually struggle with the Spanish words: piscina and fascismo
Apparently the s and th sound together are tricky
Yeah, but my brain keep saying "there are too many vowels to be just Q"
Exactly hahaha It's the ch sound that makes it hard
In school are thought British English, so I'm much more familiar with the English accent than the American one
I honestly like the pronounciation a lot (my favorite accents are Australian and English)
It's just that when I say it, sometimes it just feels like I'm having a stroke lol
I love the non pronounciation of "r" in English
It's pretty much the reason why Australian is my favorite accent
It makes pronouncing some words much more easier
Like those last two words, you just make the "o" in "more" longer and forget about "re", and the "ie" longer and forget about the "r" in "easier".
I have lived in the UK and honestly, the people who go out just to get pissed are more than in other places
It's the same people who then go to Spain and do exactly the same tbh
I haven't find this kind of people in such large numbers in other European countries, maybe in Eastern Europe
I was thinking in Russia mostly but I'm not sure either, that's why I said maybe
It makes sense then if it happens inside your home you won't have this kind of conflicts
Argentina, maybe it is quite obvious but our society and theirs share common problems, mentality and way of life
Montenegro and Andalucía both have a reputation of being lazy and be all day sleeping, so there is that
But Im myself im castillian and i don't really know with what compare it
My hometown was sometimes called spanish finland because its cold as fuck and we get good school grades but that's all
I keep getting surprised by how similar Cuba is when compared to other Latin American countries
From spellings to attitudes and ways of life
It cannot be the extra 100 years of colony because Puerto Rico feels more different, and the Philippines may be other planet
You'd think being semi-locked away after a communist revolution and a economic blockade would change that but
nope
I wonder if it's exactly that
They got rid of obscenely high/colonial legacy wealth disparity, and had the same slide from omnipresent Catholicism to apathetic Atheism as us while avoiding the Evangelical surge elsewhere in Latin America
Also while they have their anticolonial and independence heroes they aren't as anal and in-your-face hispanophobes as others can be
I am from Spain and I said exactly that when I visited Australia
This is true
>I can bet that people in Spain still vote depending on whether their ancestors were republican or monarchist
You would win that bet, 100% true
You don't know if your granfather was republican because they haven't foubd the body yet
Well, to an untrained ear, Portuguese can sound Russian
I'm going to say the [Cíes Islands] I've gone there a couple of times, one of my favourite places
[The beach of Rodas] in there was chosen by the Guardian in 2007 as the best in the world
As for unic I would say it's between [la pedriza] [Guadarrama mountain range national park] or [the beech forest of montejo]
The first is basically what it means, bundle of rocks
It's the one of the largest granitic ranges in europe
I used to live near
in my town there was a rock the size of a house no one had cared (or could afford) to move
The second looks like any mountain range but due to its altitude isolation (a mountain range separating two plateaus) it has plenty of endemisms and rare species
There's 1680 species in the park, many of which are normally found at higher latitudes
The third might look unimpressive if you come from central Europe but that's one of the southernmost beech forests in Europe and the world
Just 4° north of the world record holder in Sicily
And tbh beech forest are **glorious** in autumn
That's absolutely stunning
Reminds me a bit of Cuenca's "[Haunted City] (don't get too excited, it's just weird rocks)
I went there a few years ago and hiked up to the top where you could see the lighthouse
Absolutely stunning
I was surprised how white and powdery the sand was on the beaches
A good friend of mine lives in a small town on the coast up there (Bueu) and we’ve taken his dad’s boat and circled the islands a few times as well
Man, Galicia is a special place, can’t wait till I can go again
I thought they were called spaghetti westerns  when they were shot in Italy and chorizo westerns when they were shot in Spain
Shhh, we're trying to cheer him/her up
I have the exact same classes and at the same hour except for one subjet where the teacher is just sending powerpoints with his voice
My university has an special app for them to use integrated in the online classroom we already had
I dont kniw what is that zoom app
We only use skpe and google meet
High school here, we do about 5 weekly hours of video class, usually with zoom, google meet or Jitsi Meet
We also get about 15h of weekly homework to do, but in my school we haven't got many homework
I’m in highscool in Spain, we only use google meet, google classroom, google drive and so on
It works fine and it’s included in the G suite fee
The only issue I’ve had is that it didn’t have a grid view feature, it needed a chrome extension
I think it does include it now tho
Discord and Google Classroom
Discord because it's free and everyone had it already, and with the text channels and voice chats came in handy
At the end only like 4 of 25 in class assist to VCs where the teachers explain stuff
You don't have to either anyway really
At the start they tried to enforce it but they quickly stopped because they knew they wouldn't win
Some teachers also tried Google Meet instead of Discord but again, almost nobody joins
Our teachers have been very lax with the lessons, schedules and due times for stuff
They also don't feel like working much, I feel, haha, so it's a win win for everyone
I'm a vocational education teacher and my wife teaches a subject at the Uni
We're both using Meet because of that exact reason
Your wife is a keeper
Since the lockdown began only 2 out of 5 teachers have actually been teaching at my Uni, and we have to do the exams in the same conditions as before
We have:
Guarromán (Dirty man),
Venta de Baños (Sale of toilets),
Parderrubias (Pair of blondes),
Vilapene (Penis ville),

Berga (Dick),
Alcantarilla (Sewer)
And we have a town named Aveinte (To Twenty) and right Next to It theres a sign that says 50
Ajo (onion) and that's the only one I know
In Spain we have a bunch of those:
Malcocinados: badly cooked
Seno: an formal way of saying tit
Adiós: bye
Poo: recently renamed to Po without the locals approval
In Galicia they have Villapene (penis village)
I think we won lol
I'd like to add:
Meadero de la Reina (I don't even know how to translate it lol
The Queen's bathroom
The Queen's pee area
Whatever, you get the idea)
Espera (Wait)
Ajo (Garlic)
Los infiernos (The hells)
Villalibre de la Jurisdicción (if you throw a space between "villa" and "libre" it's "Village free of the Jurisdiction)
Buenas Noches (Goodnight)
Peleas de arriba (Fights of up there)
Peleas de abajo (Fights of down there)
Espolla (it'sdick)
Revilla Cabriada, formerly Revilla Cabriada con Franco (angry Revilla, formerly Revilla angry at Franco)
There's also a river called Polla (dick) that flows into river Ebro
Not a village, but I think it's worth mentioning lmao
And Berga
Also Guarromán, the dirty superhero
There's also a city in Asturias called Entrepeñas that in Asturian is called Entrepenes (Between penises)
Just 15 people live there
For us it's probably the [Tenerife Airport Disaster] which is the deadliest aviation accident to date
583 dead, 61 wounded
It's pretty well known, but the summary is that a pilot tried to take off without clearance, hitting an aircraft that was leaving the runway
The [Santiago de Compostela derailment] in 2013 is pretty well known, a train derailed due to it doubling the speed limit
79 people died, 139 were injured
However, that one is far from the worst train accident in Spain, [which was in 1944] when it's estimated 500 people died in a train accident
Exact number isn't known as the Franco regime covered it up (estimations range between 200 and 800)
While it was due to a brake failure, this was due to the very poor maintenance state of the trains, so I think it fits your question as well
That man might be indirectly responsible for WW1, WW2 and all the conflicts surrounding the Cold War lol
The first one that came to mind was a train accident as well, because it was "recent", in 2013: [Santiago de Compostela derailment] 79 people died because the train was at twice the speed on a curve and it was all the driver's fault
I can't imagine the feeling of guilt on the guy but
it *was* his fault
But I think the actual worse accident was the [Los Rodeos airport crash] in 1977, the deadliest accident in aviation ever with 583 deceased
Two planes crashed as they attempted takeoff when the pilot in one of the planes mistakenly thought the landing stop was clear for takeoff when it was not
A Sweden the largest city of the world :)
Well a shade of that happened: he was not sentenced to death but to life in prison and he died only a few weeks before the end of the war in 1918
By that time Serbia was occupied and had lost 1/3 of its population
I think they askdd him how he felt and he said he didn't care
He was depressive and off his medication
Whoever allowed him to fly also fucked up
Besides, he was only the copilot so the entire crisis could have been averted if the pilot had not taken a bathroom break (or, if plane doors had not been made invulnerable in the aftermath of 9/11)
Sweden is the largest CITY of the world (he meant country probably)
Oh, I remember studying that case in my engineering class
By size (extension) will be the larger
Those are just set phrases and idioms, they don't imply a belief anymore
However, people seem to get more religious when they get old, specially women
Fear,  uncertainty, and despair are allies to religion
Not necesarilly
We mostly mourn more in the sense that we're present to help the family of the deceased
Not really, I've never seen someone young talking about this stuff, it's usually older people that gets religious when someone die, but they were already realigios in private
A lot of old people here believe in some kind of god but they never go to church, so the only moment where they talk about it is at a funeral
Why especially women and in what way
In my experience it's kind of been the other way around
The older women I know are more pragmatic and seem to accept that they won't be here much longer
If they were religious before, they continue to be so at the same level
On the other hand, the guys are getting a bit more "anxious" to put it that way, and dialling up their religious sentiment to get over that anxiety
My grandfather has become insufferable (I'm saying this with love) and brings up god and heaven in every conversation, no matter what the conversation is about, lol
It's a crime how underappreciated this show is
I mean
, it's no available for streaming and it's usually a played channel tv show, if at all
Maybe in the US the show is well known but in Spain most have never heard of it
How are you so pale
Don't you guys have the hot weather and the sun shining
Or the, "Paella flamenco toros futbol oleole", and if you're an American with a lack of knowledge on geography, the "taco sombrero cholo"
The most wtf situation happened in the US:
\-And where are you from
\-I'm from Spain
\-But you look caucasian \[confused face\]
I didn't know how to react after a few seconds I said "Well, Spain is part of Europe so I guess it's normal, right
Canada:Is it cold
Spain: is it sunny
The answer to both is yes
The only foreign country I visited is England (London)  people that asked about my nationality were Spanish or had lived in Spain so they just started speaking Spanish
Barca, Barça, FC Barcelona, Messi
Oléeee, paella, toros, flamencoo, fiesta
I've been to Paris
I wouldn't want to live there either
I got that one too
Also from an American
The thing I hate most about myself is that I've got a natural tan
And that means that I look like what people think we look like
So if I ever go abroad, and say that I'm from Spain, people will think that we actually look as tanned as I look
And if that's not enough, half of my family is British
Which makes it all more confusing
Wait, why puta madre
"What
I thought Spain was in Mexico
" after flying for 15 hours to get here
I remember an interview to a spanish soccer player (Albiol) during the Euro 2008
The journalist asked him why would he visit Austria if weren't because of the eurocup
He answered: "To see the kangaroos". Really embarrassing
Eef yee could cheenge yer feet wooja
Why wouldn't you
But that's less than half of all French people right
I had a boss from Paris once and, being Canadian, Quebec came up
He said their accent sounds nasally and whiney and he said something In a mocking voice in French as if to imitate them
I'm from Vancouver so I have no idea what he said
And it was only 1 person, it's not like it happened to me with every american I met, I just said that because I found it funny
To this day I still don't know if he thought that Spain was in latin America or he said that because I have blue/grey eyes and light brown hair and I don't look like the stereotypical spaniard (something like Antonio Banderas, to name one)
Very very rarely, every 10 years or more
Nope
I live in the south
Doesn't snow here
No, and I'm not disappointed or anything cuz, you know, I live in Valencia (Spain) and It would be very very wired if I had a white Christmas
Btw, to day we have had 19 degrees Celsius
Asturias here
It snowed in the mountains, but where I live (200 m altitude) it hasn't yet
Not a single snowflake, and I live in Galicia, the "cold" part of Spain
Like 3 days here in Bratislava, what a shame brat
Reporting from Madrid, 3 days ago or so it snowed in the mountains nearby (Cotos, Sierra de Guadarrama for the Madrileños who read this) as it rained this week
Madrid is 650m above sea level, mountains are like 1000-1500m.
It won't snow here in Madrid anymore, last snow in the city was like 5 years ago at least
It was fairly popular, but today mostly it's relegated to crappy tv channels just because they have the license and some commercial in morning programs for housewives
It's not popular at all, not even with old people
I don't understand where they get the money to exist in 2020
I would like to add we have a problem with TV fortune-tellers, too many stealing money at too many 'innocent' people
I will say this  one
Robert's Capa The Falling  Soldier
We have a lot I can't choose, maybe franco and hitler idk
To add to this, also one of the most iconic photos from the civil war:
[Marina Ginestà on top of the Hotel Colón in Barcelona]
(Note: the Wikipedia article on her is a good read, she was a Republican journalist and translator for a Soviet newspaper's correspondent, and she didn't actually fight per se)
[The first Spanish astronaut should also make it to the list]
Yep
Saw it all over the place when I was in Berlin
Isnt that picture from a movie though
I do not think anyone filmed the real explosion
Idk, it doesn't look the same to me
He did took inspiration from Mussolini, didn't he
And Liechtenstein
As a Spanish I never cared about nationalistic rhetoric but I always wanted Gibraltar to comply with taxes, alcohol and tobacco prices so they could make Schengen a reality for Gibraltar too
Sealand is officially part of Britain and doesn't exist as a recognised sovereign state, tho
I could be listening to Romanian for hours
I like french and the Argentinian variation of my own language
I love Italian
They kinda sing speaking
For women italian, french or spanish with argentinian accent
For men italian
Portuguese and Catalan are two of my favourite latin languages
To me Irish and Quechua are the most beautiful, I can't say why but I love them
I am from the Basque Country and I am very impressed someone so far away played that song to you
That's incredible
Thank you
You may like this group
I find it beautiful the way they sing
[Huntza]
I've always liked [this one] although I understand 0% of what she's singing
For a non-speaker's ears there's not that much difference
Enserio, podría estar escuchando a un argentino/a hablar todo el día sin parar y no me importaría
No te estás enterando campeón. Para ti y para mi obviamente las diferencias son obvias
**Para alguien que no habla nada de español** esas diferencias fonéticas simplemente no son lo suficiente diferentes como para darse cuenta de que son variedades distintas
A ver si leemos bien en vez de salir a la ofensiva a la primera de cambio
No diría italiana, como tal, pero mola mucho jajajaja
Quizás algo canaria a lo mejor
Jajajaja pues puede ser, habría que buscar de dónde viene el acento
Charles V of Germany and I of Spain was more german than spanish
Felipe V duke of Anjou was indeed French
Amadeo I of Savoy wich was elected as monarch when the glorius revolution
Carlos III lived a lot in Naples
In the time of al-andalus some of the caliphs where from Africa especially the almohads or the almoravids
A few times these ones are the ones that come to mind:
Charles I: born in Gante
Philip V: born in France
Joseph Bonaparte: born in Corsica
Amadeo of Savoy: born in Turin
[We've had a prime minister born in the Philipines]
I think Amadeo could had been a good monarch if the spanish allowed him
Savoy was pretty liberal with all of the unification at least as far as i know
I forgot about Charles IV
He came from Naples, right
well also the french and spanish ocupation as well as the austrian one could count
> In the time of al-andalus some of the caliphs where from Africa especially the almohads or the almoravids
But those all ruled from Marrakech
Well the last almoravids ended up in Mallorca (the Banu Ghaniya)
well if i remember righ the Servian monarchy was couped due to their tendency to Austria before ww1
Please correct me if im wrong
well i should had say HRE but in spanish its calle
"Carlos I de España y V de Alemania"
(Charles I of Spain and V of Germany"
im sorry and i apologice
well due to the treaty the king of France cant be also the king of Spain
well excluding the iberian muslim kingdoms i would still consider it as i would consider grece part of the otoman empire when it was under they control and the otomans ruling grece
but its just a point of view
thats a good reason to dont count them honestly
I just say that due to his mention of the "trend" of having german monarch but thats truly interesting
As a spaniard I've taken it as this:
Born in your historic territory: not foreign
Born elsewhere: foreign
Otherwise we would have to enumerate all the kings of Spain and that would be less interesting
Basically, where they considered foreign at the time
that would had cause another war indeed and if the treaty its not valid i want naples back lol
A History teacher in secondary school, 15/16 years old, said in class that the UK betrayed Belgium during WWI
I didn't say anything but I facepalmed heavily
A couple of years before, the Math teacher said that an object standing over something is only stable if the center of gravity is exactly on the same vertical axis as the geometrical baricenter of the base of said object
I said that was not possible, that it was enough for the center of mass to be over the base, not necessarily over the baricenter, or for example a table would tip over as soon as anything is put on it
The teacher did some mental gymnastics to argue his point but there was no way on Earth to convince him
No civilization appeared in warm climates
Just a little correction: it's Crete in English
Correct me like a dumbass teacher if I'm wrong, but I think democracy does absolutely come from Greek: demos (people, folk) and kratos (power)
Power of the people
Do you celebrate the 6th of January
Here (Spain) today is The Three Wise Men's day, día de Reyes
The day prior there is a big parade at night in wich the 3 Kings and their "assistants" trow candy at cildren and as a kid is really fun
At night you leave cookies and a beverage for the Kings and water and vegetables for their camels, and leave yor clean shoes under the tree
The morning of 6th is the day children open their Christmas presents, placed  strategically next to their shoes, family gathers together and we eat Roscón de Reyes- orange blossom water sweet bread/ pastry shaped as a ring decorated with colorful candied fruits and almonds simulating a crown
Inside the baker hides a ceramic figurine or coin that if you find in your portion it is said to bring good luck and a bean that if you find you have to pay the Roscón. It is great and yummy
Father Christmas is slowly gaining terrain, though
Never expected haha so cool
So it's a wich taking part on a christian hollyday
Wow so cool
Yes, here parades weren't a big thing this year due to Covid too
Lol, in Spain it's OK to say it for an additional week as a lot of people is on leave from the office this week
Spanish Christmas season lasts 3 weeks, the week of Xmas (25/12), the week of new year and the week of the kings (6/1)
Most people usually take at least one week off from work and people in some workplaces take turns to not close, but some lucky ones take all three weeks (I.e. Teachers and students mostly)
Well, Santa Claus is finnish after all, so it makes sense
Why just only in some states
Are they traditionally Christian regions
Haha the cheap cardboard crown is a thing here too
Oooh, it seems sad to work in the last day of Christmas :(
Sup neighbor
I freaking love bacalhau à Brás. All bacalhau really
That's a really cool souvenir
So wholesome
How is that possible
Don't you have a pastry called Gallete des Rois
Makes sense haha
Hahaha I don't even know how I know this exists
Spain here
To be honest, nothing comes to my mind
The only time I remember now when I say, "Oh, shit
Here we go again" is when a headline appears saying "Juan Carlos is being investigated for
*P. D.: Why the NHS gets overwhelmed during winters
Flu
The usual news now are: it's very cold outside
In summer: it's very hot outside
I think the classic discussion about the Three Wise Men (The three Kings in Spanish) parades and if Baltazar should be a black man or any black faced guy is ok for the job fits here
Also the former king of Spain birthday is 6th of January, which made that day all about royalty
And it's the beginning of the winter sales, so it's handy to analyse the annual inflation
- It is cold in winter, the horror
- 1 mm snow causes traffic stops along mountain roads, snow plows are ready
People trapped in their cars cry they left their comfy homes because they wanted to see the snow but not like this
- Do kids these days get too much toys for Christmas
Are they good for them
- Is this year's Three Wise Men ride proof of the Left's war on Christmas
Uuh the only one that comes to my mind is this one from Bécquer:
"¿Qué es poesía? ¿Y tú me lo preguntas
Poesía… eres tú"
("What is poetry
And you ask it to me
Poetry
is you")
And a common sentence that I think is used by many people who don't even know the author (Pablo Neruda):
"Me gusta cuando callas porque estás como ausente"
("I like it when you shut up because you're like absent")
Without any doubt "Caminante no hay camino, se hace camino al andar" by Antonio Machado
It means something like "Walker, there's no path, the path is done when you walk"
O la canción del pirata:
"Con cien cañones por banda, viento en popa marinero"
What came to my mind was: "En tierra, en sombra, en polvo en nada" from Luis de Góngora (into soil, into shade, into dust, into nothing) the poem IS about a beautifull women Who eventually will loose everything that makes her pretty
Others: "volverán las oscuras golondrinas en tu balcón sus nidos a colgar" from Bécquer (the dark swallows Will in your balcony hung their nests) (the translation IS pretty awkward because the order of the sentence is: Will the dark swallows in your balcony hung their nest)
And: "polvo serán, mas polvo enamorado" Francisco de Quevedo (dust they'll be, though dust in love)
Really good
I was thinking in that poem too
Films based in Spain are full of stereotypes, romanticising many aspects of our culture, so it's kind of hard to find a good movie that represents us
I'm from Barcelona so they usually show the best parts of the city and nothing more
I think a good portrayal of Barcelona was in l[l'auberge espagnole ] spagnole
I'd say the problem relies on the fact* that while international cinema relies on Spanish stereotypes, Spanish cinema relies on regional and/or socioeconomic stereotypes or little to non-existent depictions of the locations
> that place where some dictator or bad guy has a secret bank account and the good guys need to close it down
Well, our former king (that is now living in Emirates so he won't face justice in case is required) had an account there for money laundering and most of our corrupt polititians too, so maybe is a real issue and not a Hollywood myth
Yes, we have Paella y flamenco as well
Olé!
Can't believe you just forgot the siesta
And "Money Heist".
Yeah, that doesn't count but I haven't watched it and it looks fun
Thanks
If you're studying in Barcelona (UB) as an exchange student catalan IS a footnote
That's not realistic
Otherwise study somewhere else like in UAB
You know you are swimming in pools of stolen money RIGHT NOW, not 70 years ago, don't you
Have you lived with foreign students in Barcelona
It's a movie about students living in Barcelona and it shows parts of Barcelona that aren't shown in other foreign movies
It has a realistic portrayal of it
Honestly if you expect real live in Barcelona from a catalan living here I guess you can watch any Catalan soap opera
They're talking about  something else
I bet your social benefits are higher than the highest salary I've ever had
I rather see you were touchy about the inner works of your country instead of people pointing at them
Oh, yeah, the courts of all the rest of the world are filled with those "literally no proof", but whatever
Apparently the Swiss press is as *discreet* as the Swiss banks
Cost of living is higher because you are rich
You're welcome
"I won't assume that every Spaniard is still bemoaning the passing of Franco because I'm not a complete fucking moron
That doesn't happen because he's been dead for 45 years, unlike your criminal bank industry
If you identify yourself with your banks, that's up to you
I didn't point who stole the money any time
I had to post that article in English because it literally is in other 5 languages and none of them is spoken in Switzerland:
* (JA)[スイス、銀行秘密首位から陥落]

* Português(PT)[Suíça ainda é um bom lugar para esconder dinheiro]
* عربي(AR)[سويسرا لا تزال مركزا مهما لإخفاء الأموال رغم احرازها بعض التقدّم]

Throw yourself out of a balcony
It's disrespectful for the Hotel employees that have to clean and the police that has to fill all the paperwork
Don't assume we like bullfighting, specially in the cities
Vast majority of young people despise every tradition related to cruelty with animals
Don't jump off balconies
Get close to a balcony
Specially British tourists
Damn senseless Finnish laws
Yeah, there's a common opinion in Spain that bullfighting would be nice and everything if it just didn't involved torturing and killing an animal
Lots of people would be ok with just "dodging" the bull and stuff like that, without all the violence involved
It was created in Roma
> Our beer has a bit more alcohol than in some other places
I imagine this plays a huge part
People who don't know a lot about beer think that if they have X amount at home they can have X amount in Belgium and it should be the same, right
No, not right
Pretty wrong, indeed
And England
So what
It's an italian dish
Cheap but pretty furniture and some cool food
Very popular here for young people
Also the vegan meatballs are kinda famous between vegans/vegetarians
Has the image of cheap furniture but they actually have low and high-end furniture
The high-end furniture is usually of good value for the price because of standardisation and volume
Traditional shops sometimes have better products and will generally provide a better service, and they might look more expensive but the price usually includes home delivery and assembly
Now again
you don't always need delivery and assembly
Also it's a great place to get ideas
Very good restaurant and food, I love the sour cream chips
Cheap and modern furniture, usually young couples
Then you have Leroy Merlin, Bricomart, Bauhaus etc
which caters another type of people
But not long lasting, at all
Even if the designs are kinda  cute I would never get an ikea kitchen if I wanted to have it for a long time, maybe some bookcase
When we furnished our house I only got ikea in the attic and one toilet
My Ikea bathroom furniture had problems with the humidity after just 2 years
Edit:wow all the "hurt"people cause I complained about ikea's quality
Man you need to chill, you don't own the business
It isn't personal
Cheap furniture is always bad, IKEA also have more expensive stuff
I don't know, I guess that it also depends on the product
The thing is ikea isn't even that cheap anymore so if you're going for a more expensive furniture go to a decent place
If you want to have a proper kitchen you go for a kitchen furniture business such as Santos, Aroca or Inko in Spain or go directly to small local shops
Kinda weird to know that as there's another IKEA in Seville, maybe they think it's cheaper in Portugal
Yeah sure, but people don't go to IKEA to do the kitchen, usually it's used to buy some desk, shelves, wardroves, etc
and it's really useful for students or young people that are renting a shitty flat, then when leaving the flat you can abandon the poor IKEA furniture there
If you have bought a flat/house then it's normal if you want to buy some better stuff
Actually lots of people go to IKEA to do their kitchen, just read all the "hurt" messages to my prior message ;)
That explains it all haha
oh, I guess I'm wrong, I've never used IKEA that way
For us catalonia and nationalism
Politics in general can get out of control
> I saw people trying to argue Japan was "Western" due to (among other reasons) their similar culture
Here's the thing: "Western culture"/"Western civilization"/"the West" is a veeeeery slippery concept, which can be applied in many variants
Japan is not culturally Western, but I would definitely say they are Western *politically* speaking
Latin America is totally Western from a political and cultural point of view, but if we are discussing geopolitics then "the West" is usually USA + Europe + ANZAC
And so on and so forth
Same with Russia, etc
So, I don't think this person was necessarily wrong, depending how they were framing their point
It's just hard to pinpoint "the West" accurately and it very much depends on what are you focusing in
(Incidentally, the same happens with "Eastern Europe"... do you mean geographically, politically, economically, culturally, ethnically, etc
Wow
Such a brave take on redditdotcom
Oops, sorry, I meant to summarize "Australia, New Zealand and Canada".
Yeah, in terms of global developed that's also a useful way of dividing things
Oh my god, you are the new Jesus
I bet you also think that Black panther was "just" ok
Someone should erect a monument to you
Probably best, yeah, I always read ANZAC in my mind as "Australia, New Zealand And Canada", hence my confusion and mistake xD
All hail the Messiah of Free Thought and Independence
There's a shared base in Rota that Spain uses for ships as well
Technically it is Spain's and we're just letting them use it, so I think if they ever told them to gtfo they would have to oblige
I don't like that it's there since I don't agree with most U.S. intervention in the middle East, but it's not of high importance to me
I'd much rather have NATO bases for joint NTO operations rather than US bases
in spain we call it "Embutido" but apart from this you also have some like "morcilla" ¿blood sausage
ok in english this sounds like a bad recipe for hallowen
>The Dutch, Italian, French and Swiss will never agree on which one makes the best
Spain enters the chat
Yeah
not necessarily applicable to all Europe
Here in Spain we have great water, but much of the south and eastern coast has horrible one
In spanish we say charcutería or chacinería, romance conexion
it dont finish to feel well
well you would be forgotte ones like this [
well in reality all the blood sausages
As a spaniard you have my eternal gratitude
Happy spanish sounds
now seriusly im quite tired that people only know us for paella
where have you been in Spain
I guess levante, water there is not good, is drinkable but too hard
Funny thing I learned a while back
We taught them that
The "fish frying" business (very common in southern Spain) was introduced by the sefardi comunity (Spanish Jews) to England
In fact, you can trace a surprising amount of fish frying down to the Iberian peninsula, from the US to Japan
Probably most famous internationally (at least seems to be very popular in food related subreddits) is manchego, which is a cured sheep cheese
Also, cabrales which is a STRONG blue cheese
Torta del Casar is a very creamy (you usually eat it over bread) but strong tasting cheese
Queso de Burgos is basically milk that you can eat instead of drink
But there any many, many others: it looks like almost every village here has it's own kind of cheese
Manchego (Castilla la Mancha) is the most famous and it's great, Cabrales (Asturias) if you like roquefort-like stuff also a weird suggestion is Mató (Catalonia) is eaten with honey as a dessert
Also other suggestions, Queso de Mahón (Menorca), Torta del Casar (Extremadura), Queso de Tetilla (Galicia), Idiazábal (Navarra)
There's a lot of good cheese here, Spain is like really bad at the internalization of our own products
We also have great wine, bread, olive oil, beer, etc
but all our products are always hidden behind the ones from another European country or sold as products of this country (a lot of Italian branded olive oils are actually from Spain)
I don't know, Spain being Spain I guess
I would say the most surprising would be torta del casar
It's a creamy, strong cheese
Think Munster but even more creamy
Then you have the blue cheeses in the north
Everyone here talking about Cabrales, but *"in my opinion** gamoneu reigns supreme
They go from more alike to Roquefort style to Gorgonzola
Then you have manchego cheeses, which I'm sure you know
They're sheep cheese (though I've seen cow), they vary a lot depending on the age (think how a young gouda has nothing to do with an old one)
So choose wisely
Then there's many more
You'll just have to find them out, from idiazabal to mahon
One of the great pleasures of Spain is just going to a region and tasting their cheeses
Check this page out if you want a bit more detail
Cabrales   [
its a tipe of blue cheese quite famous in spain
well the diferencies of climate and sheer sice help
Don't know about France, but here in spain
We have remarkably similar sweets
I've eaten them in Morocco and the flavours did ring a bell
>Same with fish
We live on an island surrounded by excellent fishing waters but we don't eat the fish, we sell it
(Or we did pre Brexit)
Yeah
Why though
We eat tons of fish here
Even in the interior
And we don't even have much fish left nowadays
Every time you hear the "EU" and "Fishing" Spain is there somewhere
Do you really have Spanish restaurants
How are they
(Shudders in fear)
yes but it doesnt englobe all the meats
They're pretty similar to a set of Spanish traditional sweets
>but isnt that common in other european countries too
Not really
Hungarian food isn't particularly spicy on the world stage but most countries in Europe are  spicy adverse
Probably, now that I think about it many fish eating countries are notably mountainous
Hmm interesting, I'll need a closer inspection
Do you know any by name, most have the menus online
This was
more interesting
The first you've got to know is that tapas isn't the norm in Spain at all, we eat in restaurants
However there is a strong tendency to "modernize" classics, especially when talking about starters or tapas
This restaurant follows that idea
some of the time
That means there's some reaaaaaallly weird stuff going on, like "hake wrapped in jamón with Spanish lentils" which will cause (at the very least) a coginitive dissonance in any Spaniard
There's also an extended use of harissa
which isn't used in Spain, and butter bean hummus, which I have never seen (though it may exist and butter bean is in fact typical of Valencia and fricking delicious)
There's also very non Spanish dishes (no way how you look at them) like chargrilled sweet potato
I would say it's a weird combination of Spanish "restaurant
" And "international" "tapas bar"...but it's pretty confusing
Though this is actually closer to what a Spanish restaurant might look like
A few classics (though with a bit more taste in my opinion) and a few novelties, often using foreign ingredients, or new techniques
It's kind of the opposite question
The UK has tons of variety, that's not common at all in Europe
It's actually pretty on point
Of course there is some funky stuff, but it's ok
Funny to see the combination of dishes
You wouldn't get a menu like that anywhere on Spain, it's a weird mix from everywhere and anywhere
there's some very homemad-y stuff like empanadillas, next to southern classics like "pescaíto frito" and northern deserts like Tarta de Santiago
I wouldn't say it mimics a Spanish restaurant as much as it mimics Spanish cooking along the territory
It's a strange scene
Spain here
I live in a city of 150k, used to be one that closed, we have Polish products in a shop that says it's Russian
And yes because I'm half Polish and can't live without my Pierogi
Yep, and since we discovered it my dziadzio doesn't have to send us as much things, only pierogis
No, they are very uncommon
And I don't think the average Spaniard know the name of any Polish product xD
There are some supermarket chains like Lidl or department stores like El Corte Inglés that have sections of international food that change once in a while so I guess that they might've had some Polish stuff at one moment
But it's not usual and I haven't seen any specialised store either
Maybe in bigger cities
What I have seen are stores of groceries from different Latino countries, from Morocco and from China with some extra stuff from other East Asian countries
Spain here
I am not aware of what polish groceries are
Never seen any marketed as such
Edit: I do not live in a big city though
Maybe you can find some in Madrid or Barcelona
But I've never heard of such thing
Eastern european countries and everything around the USSR & CCCP, I think that the main reason is that I've never been properly taught about it
Everything is always about France, England, some Italy and Germany, then for the XX century everything is always explained frome the USA perspective and the East is mostly ignored (not only Eastern Europe, also Asia)
So as an adult I find fascinating everything related to this because it feels new and different
Lately I'm also really interested in the story of China, it's a fascinating country
Austria and Armenia
From our history ive learnt we are stupid, and we have hard heads, our people have specialized througth history in killing between brothers, and partying over no reason
Shanghai's history for me
Yeeees, China story is completely ignored and even despised by most western people and it's great
I also find Japan and specially China very interesting with all the different dinasties but come on, European history from the collapse of the Roman Empire until pretty much First World War is the most complicated and convoluted thing ever
There´s so many wars followed by peace treaties with parties shifting sides, that it´s hard to follow
I study in Japan now and had once a class of History in IR where mostly it was European IR until the 20th Century and my asian classmate said once "compared to European history, Chinas once was at least understandable"
> our people have specialized througth history in killing between brothers, and partying over no reason
Ahh, that explains why we're nowadays so good at it
> and partying over no reason
U need a reason for that
Back in high school, it was embarrassing learning how much of a mess the 19th century was for the country
It also explains a lot of our current situation
It´s important to talk about the WWs for sure but you don´t focus on the whole Habsburg dinasty that much then
They were pretty much one of the big powerhouses for hundreds of years
In Spain we talk a lot about it as Spain and Austria had the same Habsburg dinastic line for quite a while until the succession war in 1701
800,000 years ago
I want to know who ate Gran Dolina Kid and if they seasoned him
i would travel to 1885 and try to save the live of Alfonso XII a king that was beloved by the people and seems as one of the good kings against his song alfonso XIII wich was a truly bad king
That or maybe try to make Luis Amadeo of Savoy remain as a king
Year 1000 BC
Visit the Tartessians before the Roman conquest and find out if the stories the Greeks and Romans told about them are true
Id like to see what the aztec or inca empires looked like
around 1000 during the Ummayad period of the Cordoba caliphate
I would make a trip to see the differences between the christian kingdoms and the caliphate and how they used to interact
It's Movida Madrileña in the 80's for me
About the same thing but the country just came out of a decades long dictatorship and people went completely crazy with everything
As i had regarded he was a liberal and a progresive king wich its what i think that Spain needed as it was a country that was lacking behind Europe
also his main oposition was eighter becouse he was a king or becouse he was elected
Apart from the carlist and republicans the liberals supported him a lot, imagine that they tried to convince him to stay but as he said «Ah, per Bacco, io non capisco niente
Siamo una gabbia di pazzi — No entiendo nada, esto es una jaula de locos-I don't understand anything, this is a crazy cage ».
i know russia (if that counts as europe) and would probably recognize the british one, but not much else really
I know the Spanish anthem (who wouldn’t) and I also know part of the Italian and German, as well as the Marseillaise off by heart, it’s just so badass sounding
God save the queen too
Man, I can recognise a few if I listen to them (English, French, Italian)but can we all agree that Russia's is by far the coolest anthem
I feel like fighting for mother Russia just by listening to it
I don't know the lyrics since the languages are different, but when I hear them I know where are they from
My favorite one is the russian anthem
I don't follow any sport, so I'm not exposed to anthems
You also gotta know the Spanish lyrics
> I can hum
My man, everybody can do this with the spanish one, even us spaniards
The reason is that spanish anthem has no lyrics hehehe
Spain had anthem with lyrics during the dictatorship but it was changed when it ended because it's a fascist anthem
I’d say everyone knows the words to the spanish anthem xD
Yes I know it's patriotic, but here in Spain (sadly) patriotism was a synonym of fascism since they used the flag and the anthem to glorify it
Maybe it's sad, maybe it's ridiculous, but nowadays thinking about having a patrotic lyrics reminds us the dictatorship
The Spanish anthem officially has no lyrics
That’s why I said everyone knows the words
The Spanish anthem officially has no lyrics
That’s why I said everyone knows the lyrics
That's why I said it's sad
I wish patriotism wasn't seen as fascism in Spain, and I wish people didn't use it to attack each other
But that's what we have after almost 40 years of fascism, the wounds are still open
The wounds may still be open to most resentful Leftists, Communists and Separatists, but the great majority of Spaniards thankfully got past that a long time ago
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the leftists, communist and independentistas were the most affected people during the civil war and the dictatorship
Instead of learning of our mistakes, the rightist keep attacking to that groups
As long as the right continues to use nationalism to do harm, I will continue to feel weird with patriotic symbols
What wealth
It has to be Karlos Arguiñano's cookery show
It has switched networks a few times, but his programme has been on air for 25 years, 5 days a week if I am not mistaken
It took me a day to understand andalusian accent in seville
Not im my country and even though it's not really the question, i can't unserstand dominican spanish,It just sounds foreign
All the Spanish accents are understandable between each other, so no
It struck me to know that some English-speaking people could not be able to understand between each other because of their accents
I was startled because that doesn't happen in Spanish
I guess it is because Spanish is a completely phonetic language and has a very consistent pronuntiation system
But there is always the case that you can not understand a person, not for their accent but because they do not pronounce properly or have a very lazy spelling
To this day I'm convinced certain parts of Andalucia don't speak Spanish
I would say very thick (maybe rural
) accents from: Galicia, Andalucía & Catalonia can be the hardest to understand
funnily enough when I lived in Ireland, it was Dublin's Northside accent that really got me
I had problems with some areas of Andalucía. I understood but it was harder than usual or I had to ask the person to repeat the sentece
I am from Madrid and I genuinely cannot understand some people from Córdoba or Jaén (not the capitals but the villages around)
Pretty much like with italian and portuguese, i I never learned catalonian nor galician but can understand about 70% of it
Madrid outskirts: when I was a child it was common to have 3-4 days of snow a year, sometimes more
I don't remember now the last time I saw snow on the ground
However, it's common in the mountains and the north
Where I live, in Málaga, in the south of Spain it snow 0 days of 365
Depends
At the mountains every year for many days
A day each two years, if we only count when the snow can settle
Spain
It really depends on the region and altitude but lets say generally speaking and focusing on cities like ... once or twice every two or three years in random 50% areas of the country specially towards the inner region (not coast)
Here they are well accepted, unless exceptions
I've seen medics, policemans, lawyers
with piercings and covered with tattoos
In Spain is the same as you mention for Germany, 2
288,28€.
Also, something that confuses some people is that we use billion as a million of millions, rather than the British billion, which is a thousand millions
when i was a child i was taught to use ' as decimal
3'141592
200'0003
it was in the 80'
we use the german mode 1
200,55€ (so comas for decimal separator)
It is always confusing though
I still get confused sometimes with the billion and billion
I’ve seen a lot of people write it like this tho 2
288’28€ or 2 288’28€. A lot of people use ‘ as ,
Never seen anyone use . tho
Current recommendations from the RAE is to use spaces to separate the thousands
This is to avoid confusion with the fact that some Spanish-speaking countries use dots as decimal separator, and some use commas as decimal separator
So both are currently considered valid
I like our billion, from a mathematical point of view It just makes more sense
I can almost forget that we don't call 1000 ten hundred
Not used in Spain, but the dot is the norm in some other spanish speaking countries
Millón (million)
Mil millones (thousand millions)
Billón (billion)
Mil billones (thousand billions)
Well
if you want to minimize the amount of words you have to "invent" to Code the name of a number (and still mantain base ten) It would go 10, 100, 10000, 100000000, ...
The same way, It makes sense for a mathematician to name 1
000
000 times a 1
000
000 a billion, It saves "number names".
In fact the BEST way to do It would be base 2, as done with computers
With 10 number names which IS what we need to get to 9 you could go Up to  512, without ever having to do like the romans
Of course from a day to day point of view this IS an absurd point, there's no reason to minimize the number of words needed
But again
if you want a down to earth argument ask AN engineer
This IS a student rambling
(Spain)
As some other Spanish redditors commented, it is often seen as the default mainly among the younger generation, while middle aged people may identify as religious but most don't practice at all except maybe taking part in some ceremonies
Of course old people tend to be more into it
I have to say however that in my experience, even though suffering public rejection is fortunately unheard of nowadays except in some hardcore religious groups, you can expect some degree of it in very socially conservative environments (in my town of origin not all but many people won't regard you in a good way if you skipped an important mass while being in town for example)
In bigger towns and cities nobody cares one bit, people are more open and accepting
The are not view good or bad, Spain follows a culture of live and let live so basically no one really cares about religious beliefs of neighbours or fellow countrymen
Spain has a huge amount of irreligion or atheists over 14 million people (30
3% of the population as of January 2020) while Spain is mostly catholic, practicing is falling really quick
Two decades ago used to be around 75% of the population and now is around 42%
It depends
Most religious people here aren't really that religious (believing in God but going to church only in holyday days)
There's still church going people and then we have devoted people
If you told any of these you are an atheist it is most likely that the first type will get angry with you (and probably call you a communist)
The second type is usually more comprehensive (yet not always)
atheist are always anoying over here
they are like ultra religious people, just anoying and uncomfortable to talk to
agnostics are fine tho, just like moderate believers
Well in Spain by law you can burn down a restaurant if they bring you Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola when you actually ordered Coca-Cola, so here things are more serious about cola brands than religion
Dude wtf no, they don't try to shove their beliefs down people's trougts
I don't think there's any difference between religious and atheists
Normally, they celebrate the holidays cause they see it as part of culture and tradition
This is not true
Atheists may come as annoying or bad to really religous people, often catholics that are from other generations
But right now, and in the younger generations, atheists live a normal live as everyone else, and don't really brag about being an atheist or confront other people for not being it
What surprises me is that from the information that I have gotten in the internet, and some studies, in Spain around 70% of people are Catholic
Although you don't even notice
many do try
it's as anoying talking to a militant atheist as it is to a militan religious person
Sure, but I really don't know many, from ether side
Our previous prime minister (Mariano Rajoy )was a walking joke, when he got lost in a sentence he would say absurd things
These are one of my favourites:
*Holding a glass of milk* "¡VIVA EL VINO
(LONG LIVE THE WINE
* At an election rally* "Es el vecino el que elige al alcalde y es el alcalde el que quiere que sean los vecinos el alcalde"
(It is the neighbor who chooses the mayor and it is the mayor who wants the neighbors to be the mayor)
*In the parlament, refering to the leader of Podemos, a left-wing political party*
"Cuanto peor mejor para todos y cuanto peor para todos mejor, mejor para mí el suyo, beneficio político"
(The worse, the better for all, and the worse for all, the better, the better for me, yours, political benefit)
It is the hell of Spanish syntax
Manita arriba for the translations
* "Somos sentimientos y tenemos seres humanos" ("We are feelings and we have human beings")
* "Tenemos que fabricar máquinas que nos permitan seguir fabricando máquinas porque lo que nunca va a hacer una máquina es fabricar máquinas" ("We have to fabricate machines that let us continue fabricating machines because what a machine will never do is fabricate more machines")
* "Me gusta Cataluña, me gustan sus gentes, \[...\], son emprendedores, hacen cosas, exportan" ("I like Catalonia, I like its peoples, \[...\], they are entrepenurial, they do things, they export")
* "La cerámica de Talavera no es cosa menor, dicho de otra manera, es cosa mayor" ("Ceramics from Talavare are not a minor things, to put it in another manner, they are a major thing")
* "It's very difficult todo esto" ("It's very difficult all of this")
* "España es una gran nación y los españoles muy españoles y mucho español" ("Spain is a great nation, and the Spaniards very Spanish and much Spanish")
* "Esto no es como el agua del cielo que cae sin que se sepa muy bien por qué" ("This is not like the rain from the sky which falls without anyone really knowing why")

The wild thing is that apparently he was a pretty good orator in Parliament back when he was leader of the opposition (pre-2012), it was only (mostly) after becoming PM that he began doing these things
The toll of leadership, I guess xD
And my personal favourite:
He voted against the national budgets proposed by himself
Here you can get in trouble for sending threats or trying to revolt against the king but not being able to joke about him sounds awful, sorry turkbros
It was more the way he said it that sounded more absurd, in Spanish syntax the phrase is quite messy and lacks meaning
Thank you there
He did multiple fucks up anyway, so
kind of counts lol
Well at least you can point the stupidity of it
There is no "-sh" in Spanish (oh, the irony), except for the former PM Rajoy
In spanish i had heard 2 ways one with the t ond one without the t
in english ii would say with the s instead of the sh
I say both, tbh
I know it's supposed to be pronounced with a -sh- but sometimes I forget and just use -s-.
Weeeell in some parts of Andalucía "ch" is pronounced "sh". But yeah no "sh" sound in standard Spanish
That's sh-, not -sh
Also, it exists even in my dialect, not an Argentine exclusive
That's sh-, not -sh
I'm from the Canary Islands in Spain
We generally have it a bit better than some other overseas territories in other countries due to how much tourism we get
I'd say most of the younger generations keep in touch with the mainland but if you go to smaller communities they tend to feel more isolated
The majority of people feel European due to our relative closeness to the continent and the fact that we never really had any other ruler besides Spain for 500 years
There's plenty of local news here in Tenerife especially when it comes to radio or newspapers, I can't say for any of the other islands
But often when watching news on TV you could feel a bit disconnected from a robbery that has happened 500 km away in a town you've never heard of
As for relatives, most are in Ireland
However most people I know have atleast one close relative that lives in the mainland
I live in the United States and the other day a Mexican guy was fixing something in my house
I switched to Spanish and he suddenly was like "where are you from
" "Do you speak Spanish in Spain
" To which I answered, "seems like it"
Hahahahah, sounds about right
However my family are actually Irish, only my mum wanted to escape the shitty weather
Play your cards right and we can be relatively close to 3 continents ;)
Nah my family is actually Irish, just my mum decided to move to Tenerife
Python, Go and C++ so I won't have any problem in the future finding jobs
Korean, French and Iberian
Such a shame Iberian is almost completely lost, it is impossible to learn it with the knowledge we have today
I have a long list of languages I want to learn, to be honest
The ones which should be useful to communicate with as many people as possible (and that have business value, for example) would be Chinese, German and possibly French
The latter two would greatly help me move across Europe
An extra boost to my English would be nice, too
The ones I like would be Swedish, Icelandic, Japanese
And I'd love to learn Russian or Polish, or even Finnish
Old languages like Latin, Goth, Old Norse, Celt dialects, Iberian, etc
would be cool too though
Probably French, I've never been really good at it
Also German and Chinese
I would never learn Chinese in any other way, it looks too hard to read to even try
Russian, Mandarin chinese and Basque
Russian because it's very useful in the ex-soviet countries and can be used in very different countries
Mandarin because China is gaining weight and influence in the world, plus I really like China
Basque because it is something that I always wanted to learn but I feel it's too difficult and not useful in my situation, as I live far fron the Basque Country
If one day I move to the Basque Country or Navarra I'm pretty sure I will learn it
Europeans: German, russian and french
I migt be learning German soon either way, because i want to study there and russian and french are great for travel
I once Saw a russian, a montenegrin and a Czech talking no problem with each other and that just feels crazy to me
I also really like how russian and german sound
All included: mandarin, french, german
Mandarin just for the sake of understanding 1
3 "billion" people, plus i want to explore china one day of these and It might come usefull
French would just be great, if you Talk french and english you can kind of get by in Africa as a whole (with some exceptions) and that would be amazing
if I got to keep the ones I already speak, I would probably choose German and Russian, which I've been thinking about studying
Not sure about the 3rd, maybe Dutch or Arabic
Mandarin because of the huge amount of speakers, Japanese so I can read untranslated LN (yes I'm a fucking weeb) and basque just to flex
German, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese
- German: useful language to know in Europe, can allow me to work there more easily as well
- Chinese: China is one of the most powerful countries in the world, and it keeps growing
Adding to this, the language is very difficult so to be able to speak it without having to learn would be a huge advantage
- Japanese: Uhh, yeah, I like Japan, I'm kind of a weeb
And the language is not easy either
I considered picking French, which I've started studying recently, but as a Spaniard it's an easy language to learn so I can do that on my own
But do I lose the ones I already know
If I'm still able to speak the ones I know (Catalan, Spanish, English) I'd learn German, Chinese, Japanese
If I have to choose only 3: Catalan, Spanish and English
>also makes Italian somewhat understandable
I can vouch for that
the written form is really similar and the pronunciation isn't crazy like with portuguese or french
I can at least make sense of some slowly talked italian and the written form is way easier
This reminds me I actually tried to find resources to learn at least a bit of our Iberian language, but found none of it
It's a shame it disappeared so harshly that nowadays there is close to zero information about it
Celtiberian and the different celtic dialects of the north/north-east would be great too
I just wish we knew as much about our native tonges as other countries in Europe do (for example, there seems to be much more information about gaulish languages, even though those became extinct too)
Maybe Goth would be interesting too
If I remember well, northern Spain was the last place (or at least one of them) outside of Eastern Europe were this germanic language was still spoken
If I had to go for a pre-Roman language, I'd probably choose tartésico
I also want to learn “sort of Iberian”, but in my case it would be the Spanish languages that I don’t know as well as Portuguese:
+Euskera
+Galician
+Portuguese
Catalán/Valencian and Castilian Spanish I already know, so those are the main languages I’ve got left
Yep, it was spoken in the east of the peninsula before the romans came
If I remember correctly in the west you had Tartessian and Lusitanian
This [website] has all the info we know about pre-roman languages (is not much though)
In the case of Iberian we know how to pronounce it and read it, but the meaning is completely lost
There is a "Rosetta stone" (Arquitrabe de Sagunto) with an inscription in Latin and its (supossedly) translation in Iberian, but it is broken and a lot of the information is lost
We can only hope that someday we find something similar to finally learn the language
Yeah tartéstico would be really cool too, the tartessian civilization is really interesting
Yes, the problem with portuguese IS pronunciation
Italian IS Close enough so that we understand most words and the pronunciation IS pretty straightforward, so even though portuguese IS Closer It ends Up being HARDER to understand
I guess that in the end Latin fused with all the languages of that era and we ended up with the million languages we have in the peninsula, but yeah it would be nice to know the original languages
At midnight no people outside of the pub at the terrace or just hanging around, everyone in, doors close and smoking is allowed (kinda)
So neighbours don't complain
If they serve you beer bottles instead of glasses, don't bring them back to the bar when you're done, they're a sign of status and seniority
It isn't an unwritten rule if nobody follows it
Man those are the best :)
I thought regulations regarding pubs would be laxer up there given the big culture present
Where I'm from it's normal for establishments to stay open well into the next day's early morning (3-4am or even until later)
ask the barman
Otherwise they're going to think you're stealing
Barcelona citizen here so I'll speak about my city only
They're everywhere in the centre of the city, specially in the whole Plaça Catalunya-Las Ramblas-Barceloneta area, and they wear huge firearms
Since 2020 has been a weird year I haven't seen them that much, mostly because there isn't any tourism so I'm guessing that the risk of having a terrorist attack has been reduced
Also, a lot of cops are dressed as civilians in that area but they still carry guns with them
In the rest of the city you can see the heavily armed ones sometimes, but it's not as common
All the police I have seen were armed with hand-arms
I have even seen traffic police with G36s.
In the Basque country where I live, It's pretty common, and has always been
Since there was this terrorist organization ETA and a many violent protests on the streets, police was very common and most of times heavily armed
It all went calm after in 2010 ETA was finally dissolved and people began focusing more on Catalonia
However this year with covid restrictions been  skipped, you won't go outside without seeing a couple of police cars
I have lived in several cities of Spain and the usual equipment is a pistol
Traffic agents may not carry it within the city
Heavier weapons (submachine guns or shotguns) are usually seen only if there is a terrorism alarm
When ETA still existed you could see heavy guns guarding the entrance of some official buildings too
That's pretty much just Madrid or Barcelona
In the rest of the country, policemen of whatever force carry a "just" handgun
It's unthinkable for me that a policeman wouldn't carry a weapon, like it seems to happen in other countries
You could see an increase in their numbers and start seeing rifles when the risk of terrorist attacks was through the roof
Now you see many more patrol cars because of covid, trying to enforce all the measures
In Alicante I've only really noticed them in the airport, not around the city
Definitely not in towns (as far as I can tell)
They carry heavy arms only when they are looking for a specific, dangerous criminal
They get you when you run out of luck
That's funny because the only place I've seen regular police with heavy firearms, other than in special deployments, is in the UK
Here in Donosti havs been some confrontation between youngsters doing botellón and ertzaintzas armed with rubber ball guns, remembering the good old days when kale borroka was a thing, garbage containers set in fire and policemen formed in squad
You see, half of the cars around La Línea carry a ton of hashish
Oceania, and America is one continent that has three subcontinents: North, Central and South America, being CA what's between Mexico and South America
Five continents, just as the five olympic rings represent the five continents of the world since 1920
We don't care for Antartica cause they are not good at sports over there
Zealandia was considered a full fledged continent like one or two years ago, so it is not taught, and most data is not updated
The seven-continent model is usually taught in most English-speaking countries including the United States, United Kingdom[38] and Australia,[39] and also in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and parts of Western Europe
The six-continent combined-Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan
The six-continent combined-America model is often used in Latin America,[40] Greece,[23] and countries that speak Romance languages
The United Nations[24] and in the Olympic Charter[25] in its description of the Olympic flag derived the five-continent model from the combined-America model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited
Can confirm
I tend to still use the word America to refer to the US in spanish and they always give me the "But you're american".
I won't forget that Canadian girl that was mad at me when she asked me whether I had been to Canada and I answered I had never been to America
Earth Has a New Continent Called 'Zealandia', Study Reveals
But according to a new study of Earth's crust, there's a seventh geologic continent called 'Zealandia', and it has been hiding under our figurative noses for millennia
The 11 researchers behind the study argue that New Zealand and New Caledonia aren't merely an island chain
Instead, they're both part of a single, 4
9-million-square kilometre (1
89 million-square-mile) slab of continental crust that's distinct from Australia
"This is not a sudden discovery but a gradual realisation; as recently as 10 years ago we would not have had the accumulated data or confidence in interpretation to write this paper,"
Since yor comment was a mere link it was hidden by the automod so I can't reply to it
>‘The importance of Zealandia is not so much that there is now a case for a formerly little-known continent, but that by virtue of its being thinned and submerged, but not shredded into microcontinents, it is a new and useful continental end member
’ This view is reiterated in the conclusion to the paper, ‘Zealandia is not a collection of partially submerged continental fragments \[as was inferred for Pacifica\] but is a coherent 4
9 Mkm2 continent
This is from your pdf, it says what I said, Zealandia is a continent
and this was on the news recently
It didn't ceased to exists (as you say) it was discovered that exists
Mexico is in North America
North America has USA, Canada and Mexico
Was pretty bad
But it got better with time
It's still not very bike friendly but at least the Dutch can manage now
In my city it's horrible, there aren't that many bike lanes and many of the ones that exist exclusive aa lanes for biked are abandoned
Bur many bike lanes are on the road itself, so you either move out of the way to let cars pass or live with the fact that you're inconveniencing someone
I know my city infrastructure is complicated to adapt as most streets are narrow but the unattended lanes just shows there isn't much interest anyway
We eat
a lot and talk
while eating
We mostly eat
There's always some drama but mostly it's just a pretty chill reunion
Got a big family so we split the time with my father's family and my mother's family
I usually hang out more with my father's family, but for Christmas or special occasions we hang out with my mother's family as it's pretty big
My family gatherings are just my parents and me now (they're divorced but they have a good relationship and hang out often), so there's not much
The "larger" family gatherings were not even that large, that'd be my parents, 4 grandparents, my uncle and his SO (and me)
It's just
Talking
Nothing interesting goes down

Velázquez too
Don Pelayo
>Spinoza
Pictured me surprised
Didn't know it was still such a big deal
He was from the Republic of Genova, but he is a very important figure in Spain's history, that's why I listed him
There are many regions in Spain with their own Columbus' origin story, taken with different levels of seriousness
I should have included Estanislao Figueras as well, just for his very famous phrase during a cabinet meeting:
"Gentlemen, I'll be frank you with you
I have fucking had it with us all
" (Caballeros, voy a serles franco
Estoy hasta los cojones de todos nosotros)
It's very well known that he was from the Republic of Genova, but he is definitely an important figure in the history of Spain, that's why I listed him
There are many regions in Spain with their own Columbus' origin story, taken with different levels of seriousness
But everyone knows that the official history at least says he's genoese XD
He was Italian (Genoan, to be more precise), but he is definitely a historical figure in Spain
“Gentlemen, I can’t take it anymore
I’ll be honest with you
I’m bloody tired of all of us”
I think it would be a more accurate translation
But for a president it was kinda a strong statement
But I didn’t know about while I knew the quote
Clarification for foreigners: we do study it but not to the point of learning the names of inquisitors
Torquemada is the most famous one (and the only one I personally know) but I wouldn't say everyone knows him
I wanted to add a very strong swear word to match the strong "cojones" used by Figueras
Fair enough then
Are the Brit tourist in your country also jumping from the balconies and dying
Is quite common in Spain, specially in summer and in places like Magaluf or Salou
Are the balconies existing in Britain
&#x200B;
This is the thrid case in **this week
&#x200B;
Normally they are getting drunk and trying to jump from the balcony to the pool of the hotel, sometimes with fatal consecuences
&#x200B;
Lloyd Milen said  "Brits don't typically have balconies in their homes, so they're not used to it
" .
&#x200B;
Is it the case
Is it common in your country
In  Spain is so common that it has his own name: "balconing"
_Cries in living in Mallorca and all the balconing news every week in regional TV_
Do you realize that if somehow Spain is at war against UK, the only thing we have to do to defeat them is move the pools a metre away
Edit: typo
Funny to find this topic because a friend of mine just sent me yesterday  [
In spain we have a spanenglish verb for that    balconing
>"Brits don't typically have balconies in their homes, so they're not used to it
Gracias, edito
WTF I love bar owners now
In Spanish we usually treat it more like a noun:
"Murió haciendo balconing" = "He died doing balconing";
"El balconing es muy peligroso" = "Balconing is very dangerous".
I think it's not a a beautiful sounding leanguage and I like my nother tongue way more
For example, if I explain my feelings in english, I feel completely detached from what I'm saying
I use it almost all my day
It's a clusterfuck of made up rules that don't reinforce each other, and pronunciation can be anything
Still get a lot of productivity of it, but i enjoy using my native spanish more
Spaniard here: there are five vowel sounds in our language
The Latin alphabet has 5 vowels : a, e, i, o, and u. I guess you can see what's my main complain about using English
I enjoy It
It's grown on me ever since I lived in Ireland
In the future I would like to gain a native accent and level C2
Many here are pointing out that English has a huge vocabulary
While that's true, some languages like spanish can easily compete
That's probably why english has never stricken me as particularly vocabulary rich
I have a deep respect and appreciation for my mother tongue, so, even though I love English, Spanish will always have a prime place in my heart
English pronunciation is anarchic
I use it as a tool
I don't know about you, but I don't like my tools to be anarchic
It is more flexible than spanish
But spanish sounds more powerful
> Our spelling is a lot more consistent (even if not obvious at first if you don't know the rules)
This
I always hear people saying that French is more inconsistent in its spelling/pronunciation than English, but that is not true
Yeah, French has stuck with its historical spelling, and three vowels are pronounced as one, but the sound of those three vowels does not change
If you see those three vowel combination, you'll know how to exactly pronounce it; whilst this is not possible in English because one letter, or combination of them, can be pronounced in a lot of different ways
Just a little rant xD
There are other languages with an unnecessary amount of vowel sounds but they thought "hey, maybe we should write them as ä, à, â, å... Ya, that should do the job". Meanwhile you guys went: "I bet I'll know how to do it when i see it, fuck it".
Tell that to the French speakers
Spanish name\*, it literally means "mercies", the plural form of mercy
Try Portuguese or danish
It sounds like they're required to say the word but they're too tired to care, so the ending is a fluke
Well, the initial outbreak "started" near my municipality and now we have outbreaks here too, soo I'm not really confident in going back to school
If anyone is wandering, I'm from the south of the comunidad de Madrid
I live in Bratislava, pretty safe here for my boy at the kindergarten
In the words of one of the country's largest civil servants' unions: "[schools do not have enough staff, protocols, or resources to implement the Early Response Plan to the Covid19 designed by the Ministry of Health] In short, a plan exists but it seems impossible that it will be implemented by September (which is when the schools should be reopened)
This is totally credible according to our experience of past months (in April they were supposed to give financial aid to the self-employed workers to survive the lockdown and there is still people who have not received it
They also talk about the fact that the systems to be able to give classes online have not been improved, so the situation in this sense remains as chaotic and uneven as it was during the lockdown
Considering that classrooms in most of Spain were already overcrowded before all this madness, to this day I have no confidence that this will work and I am worried about several members of my family who are teachers (and of course worried about the children
I think the best humoristic quotes are from M. Rajoy
Some of his best quotes are:
•"I like Catalonia, I like it's people
They do things"
•"We are feelings and we have human beings"
•"Is the citizen the one who chooses the mayor and is the mayor who wants to be the citizens, the mayor"
•"Spain it's a great nation and the spaniards very spanish and a lot spanish"
•"You think before talking or you talk after thinking
•"ETA (a terrorist group) is a great nation
Spain, sorry it's a great nation"
•"The worst the better for everyone and the worst for everyone the better, the better for me  the yours political benefit"
Yes, he was our president
Julius Caesar once said: “Beati Hispani quibus bibere vivere est
” wich means "blissful are the Spanish, for whom drinking is living"
Well, Mariano Rajoy has sort of humoristic quotes
Our former PM, Mariano Rajoy, was famous for his weird quotes, like:
"The spanish, very spanish and a lot of spanish",
"When Worse, better for everyone, and when better, for everyone, Worse, for me, and yours, political benefit",
"It's the neighbors who choose the mayor, and it's the mayor Who wants the neighbors to be the mayor",
"Because after year 14, comes year 15",
"Talavera's ceramics aren't a minor thing, said differently, they are a Major thing",
"One thing is being solidary and other one is being It for nothing in return",
"We are feelings and we have human beings",
"It's very difficult todo esto",
"¿Do you think before speaking or speak after thinking
"I said i would lower taxes but i am raising them"
"Be like me, don't get into politics" - Francisco Franco
Well, I mean, she's right
- A glass is a glass and a dish is a dish
- We are feelings and have human beings
- It's the neighbor the one who chooses the mayor, and it's the mayor the one who want to be the neighbors the mayor
- ETA is a great nation
- I like Catalonia, I like its people, they are hardworking, they do things
- Glory to the wine
(while drinking milk)
- You see, something remarkable has happened to me
I wrote down some notes, but I can't read my own handwriting (during a radio talk)
Of course we have, they are in Spanish obviously but here you go:
One of my favourites is: "We are feelings and we have human beings"
Not even him knows what he was trying to say
Not to good
I'm sorry
I know they have beautiful mountains and that they learn spanish really really fast
Damn it, I was gonna make the same joke
Quoting the username of the guy you're responding to
That's a power move and I respect it
Romania, as well as other countries that have significant inmigration in Spain, tend to have the reputation that these people have generally speaking, which is not that great at this point
Meaning that the average Spaniard ignores almost everything else about the actual Romania, sorry, we are very self absorbed
The same way that in many southamerican countries Spaniards used (or even today) to be seen as hardworking but somewhat dull people, because of the waves of humble, uneducated and starving  people that left Spain looking for a better life on the early and mid 20th century (many of them from my region, Galicia)
In Costa Rica they even have "Gallego" (Galician) as a derogatory term for dull people, out of xenophobia and ignorance
Same as in Spain regarding Romania because of the Romanian gypsies
For me, Romania is just Bucharest, Ceausescu and his palace, Transilvania legends and Gica Hagi
I don't know much about it's landscape or culture
I think for us it is the least known of our latin/romance family, and a country still to be discovered as a travel destination
Unfortunately your people are treated really bad there, and I apologize for that also
Ah there's nothing we can do against that
Or maybe yes, idk
I think the racism against Romanians in Spain has more to do with the country they come from (and obviously the amount of immigration) than from any association with gypsies
Basically because there are a lot of gypsies themselves with their fair share of racial discrimination, but I would say these two are distinct
There might be but it's too hot right now and I'm going to go to sleep until it's cooler
Night night
> I mean originally it was xenophobia, but now we do it because tradition
I feel the same, I don't think "gallego" is necessarily offesnive nowadays
I'd say it's got more to do with unfair association with crime
Im from the north of Spain, from the province of Soria, we ain't mediterranean at all and sadly i've never had the chance to travel outside of Spain but i always felt like italians and portuguese are close to us and quite similar, romanian speakers, well they are already a different thing, amd french speakers
Well i don't really feel them closer to us than a german or a british, but honestly i may not be the more objective when talking about France
I am from Northern Spain and somehow I feel more related to the Atlantic or Celtic Europe than to the Mediterranean Area
Even when our languages are so different the landscapes, food or cultural traditions are very familiar to me
I think it's more of a historical/geographical thing
So for example most spaniards feel close to italians
But it's more of a Southern thing in both countries
Galicia IS much Closer to Portugal and overall both northern Spain and Italy have closer ties with France
It might seem it's a linguistic link but then there's Romania which shares very little culturally with the rest of romance speaking countries
In the other hand there's malta, they speak semitic and they're among the closest countries to Italy
In the end language doesn't have an overarching influence in culture
However it's a nice way to broaden nationalistic claims
that's why serbian, Bosnian and Croatian are "different" languages despite all being the same, or why languages get forbidden again and again
They're a tangible and clear difference in a world where culture is often gradual
So to add Up: most times countries which share similar languages are Close not because of the language but because of common history, or proximity, which develops into cultural ties (we use the same deck of cards as Italy, canelones are a regional Dish in Catalonia, malta eats timpana, and greece baklava)
Many times similar enviroment upbring similar customs, like cider culture in northern Spain and certain parts of the UK
Finally, language can be used to broaden cultural differences and that's made language a target of nationalism (and even centralism), which has "created" new languages (Urdu vs Hindi) as well as destroy them (the BEST example i could think of is the US, though many countries have tried It with different levels of succes
Spain has tried to kill it's languages for a loooong time and during the franco regime shit hit the fan, essentially forbiding use outside the home)
Portugal = Spain = Italy
France and Romania
Well
Yes, in fact I think the language is the only thing that makes us different, otherwise, I wouldn't feel closer to someone from Madrid than to someone from Rome
He doesn't sound like the most unbiased source
Do you feel any link to the Canarians
Is "uma hora menos en Açores" a thing
The Brazilians I've met in Spain don't feel different than Colombians or Venezuelans, for instance
I'm from Asturias hehe
The same thing happened to me while visiting London, I felt the landscapes in the countryside were like my home region, just less mountainous
In Madrid it's a complete different history, it is dry and sunny even when is cold
>I'm wondering: do you fellow Andalusians feel more connected to us Algarvians/people from Alentejo (Alentejians, I guess) than people in the northern Spanish provinces
I live by the very border, and no
I've crossed the border hundreds, if not thousands of times, and I don't get accustomed to how obvious are the differences in such a short trip
It's not that the difference is that huge, but the border makes them more abrupt than the gradual continuum you find when travelling all over Spain
I live in Valencia, so I would say the Cathedral of Santa María or the Silk Market
Either the [Farola] building at the center of town or the [city hall]
Yes, I live in a very irrelevant city
I'm don't live in a town, but the nearest one has part of an old medieval wall (with tower included which is used as a tourism agency) and  around it it conserves a lot of the original street layout
A famous castle, built in 1579 (during the rule Philip II of Spain)  over the remaining of a watchtower to fight the Barbary pirates
Nowadays I think more people think of the arts and science area
Well, currently yes, I would say that the arts and science area is more remarkable
its a small city with only 20k population in Galicia (northwest Spain)
you can find way better ones to visit like [Santiago] in there
The Spanish word for hammer is "martillo".
I guess it's subjective how bad-ass a word may sound to people
I don't know of other languages, I only speak English and Spanish and a bit of French (which I don't know what the word for "hammer" is)
In spanish it dont have that sense of power is just "Martillo" wich is pretty boring and standart
I had always feel that hammer is better specially warhammer
[Click to hear "martillo".]
Martell in catalan
Martell is how we say it in Catalan and martillo in Spanish
It sounds exactly like [Spanish for "they crash"] You don't get much more metal than that lol
In Catalan it's also very similar
'Martell'. It's pronounced more like 'mart-ey'.
Still it's a very little *marto*
I'd say "martillo" sounds pretty hard, I think it's harder than "hammer".
This one wins it for me
Finnish is a very cool language
In Spanish Carles Martel is called Carlos Martel, without translating the last name
I guess Carlos Martillo doesn't have the same ring
Martillear in Spanish, exactly same meaning
Is the "ll" always pronounced as -y in Catalan when it comes after a consonant
Depends if you still live with your parents or not
At 25 me and all my friends were already working but some of us were  living alone and some still at their parents
Us would save little to none while the others would obviously save way more
I'd say the average salary was between 1500 to 2000 at the time so I'd save around 200 or so living alone
I was living in London at 25, renting with my partner in a shared flat
I was saving around 400-500 GBP / month which was around 20-25% of my take-home pay
I'll be glad if I make 1000€ after finishing my master's degree
Same here and that's why Italy and Spain have one of the lowest birth rates in the world
What
Average
In Spain
Are we talking about the same Spain here
Or you mean average between you and your group of friends
As a Spaniard I feel this
You'll be glad if you find a payed job in Spain
This is something super important that we have to fix
We won't be able to pay our parents' pensions otherwise, but I've yet to see a single political party, from the left or the right, adress the issue
And there are people that don't want immigrants, smh
I joke to my friends that they better have at least two kids lol
Thank you for your comment, I was feeling poor
The French 25's in that comment is like the Spanish 30's (for an engineer)
That's because our economy has structural problems
Most businesses are too small to provide well paid jobs and if you check the average wage by sector in Spain, most people work in the sectors with the lowest average wages (mostly shops and bars)
In order to solve this, we need investments, especially in regions like Extremadura or Castille-La Mancha, which have left behind
But that takes long, we would see the results in 15 or 20 years, too complicated for our short-term mentality
Yeah, although that's another problem on its own
Covid has shown that we can't rely on tourism to sustain a big chunk of the economy
This doesn't have an easy solution, Spain has had a budget deficit and a lot of unemployment practically since the 19th century
Spain could become the Silicon Valley of Europe if only people realized we need big businesses to create wealth BEFORE we can have a complete welfare state
We got pretty good infrastructure and we were one of the first countries in Europe with 4G coverage, if we invested in the technological sector we could grant wealth and plenty of jobs
I think they will eventually develop a culture close to the original one of the people of that place
The North people will die of heat and dehydration and the south of people will die of cold and overhydration
Andalucia would want independence
A lot of southerners freezing to death because they don't have winter coats
Northerners not knowing how the air conditioner works
Then Catalonia will have finally lemons
(And Murcia will want to indepence themselves)
So, a disaster of biblical proportions
The main conflict would be *mini* vs *cachi*
Just imagine, Murcia independent again
No, but suddenly Spaniards are ok with letting Cataluña go
The near 1 litre plastic cups are usually called "minis" in the Center and South of Spain and cachis in several northern regions
There are more names besides those two, but they are the ones I'm the most familiar with, and I was just joking
Prueba sin la tilde, tal vez sea eso
In a couple o years
How are they called at your area
I find this issue oddly interesting
It's not accepted but it's really common among young people (both men and women) during parties
I have to admit I have done it many times and I am sure most Spanish would say the same thing
It's disgusting because it smells really bad and it's unhealthy for the people living in the area
Plus it usually happens on summer and the dry and hot air doesn't help
Just pee anywhere but like away from people no one really cares
Pero dnd vives me meo
On a night out in Spain everyone does it
>"No, it's fine bro, as long as your dick isn't showing people won't care if they see you doing it
Yeah well people do care, they won't say anything because people don't care enough to say something to 3 young guys probably drunk, risking being beaten up, but they care
I too though people didn't care when I was younger until I received a bucked of freezing water upon my head while peeing in the wall of a residential building
nunca has estado en un botellón?
Si bro, pero mear en la calle no es pa tanto lol ayer mee en la estacion y meh
I like mine al dente, but I don't judge
Except when I see people putting oil in the water
I do, but my wife doesn't so I never get to eat it lol
I like pasta in almost every way but ya, I prefer al dente
Viva Italia
I do this sometimes and a friend saw me once and looked at me like I was the worst monster to ever live
Tbh I have done this too with spaghetti while I wait the water to star boiling
Yo lo hago siempre
Mientras espero a que el agua hierva me voy tomando algun espagueti crudito
Supposedly they put oil to stop the pasta from sticking (which doesn't work either)
I've read somewhere that it can prevent the pasta from properly absorbing water, making it cook unevenly
It can even stop the sauce from properly sticking to the pasta
So it has 0 benefits, and some potential drawbacks
It's a big no
We don't sleep siesta often
Like, except retired people and some children, and overworked people falling asleep on the couch when they arrive home
Also, it's not always sunny/hot, we aren't the Sahara desert, it's quite cold/fresh all the year on many places
Add that we don't attend parties/traditions so often and aren't as lazy as people say, and we aren't eating stereotypical food (paella/tortilla/churros
) everyday
Eco friendly
Does conscription apply to women
Come on, you've got to hold your homie's hand once in a while bro
Most people I know sleep siesta if they have time for it
>if they have time for it
Exactly
I mean, it depends on who you ask
I'm a student, and sometimes people are so stressed that they take long naps weekly or even daily
Not everyone in my family sleeps "siestas", but a lot of them do if we have like an Sunday family meeting (after a big, three-course meal) or if their work schedule allows them to
We do eat dinner between 20:00 and 22:00, but we tend to go to sleep at around 00:00, though 2 am would still be seen as a normal, if rather late, hour ot go to bed, especially if you come home late or aren't a sleepy person
Crimes against humanity
Too strong flavour, it chokes any other flavour of the pizza
Just eat bread with ketchup, for that purpose
When I learned about spelling bees I was quite surprised
As you already know, in Spanish the concept would be pretty absurd
There are some weird words and some homophones, but the  spelling is pretty straightforward
In fact, reading is supposed to be obvious except for a FEW  exceptions, like psicólogo
I remember the exact moment It occurred me I would never be able to learn English spelling completely
I had been living in Ireland for a while and I had to read the word vineyard in class
I assumed it was pronounced vine-yard, because it made Sense
Why
English WHY
I know about them thanks to Disney Channel
As a kid I was confused because the shows were  dubbed in Spanish so I was like "this is really easy, why do they have these competitions
". It didn't occurred to me that the original show was in English xD so they started to make more sense when I grew up
It is not a big thing in Spain, but it does exist
I only heard it once during 3rd or 4th of secondary school (ESO) and at least my region has a "Concurso regional de ortografía" which translates to a regional spelling bee competition
As you say, Spanish is ridicously easy in that matter, so it has no merits being able to spell words correctly
I know about them from watching American movies and TV, as I’m sure many Spaniards do, but no, we don’t have them in Spain
As you well guessed, Spanish is a language where things are mostly written the way they are pronounced, so these contests wouldn’t make much sense
Sure, there are some weird spelling rules and people do make spelling mistakes, but the words where this happens are not enough to justify a whole contest about it
When I was a kid and I watched a spelling bee scene on a movie (dubbed) I was always a bit confused, since I could see the characters who were supposed to be the “smart kid” struggling, and I thought it looked so easy
Now that I know English, I understand
Yeah no, Spanish is spelled phonetically so there is no such thing as spelling bees
it blew my mind when I realized they were a thing in English
Actually, there’s a Spelling Bee in Spain
It’s called “Concurso Hispanoamericano de Ortografía” (Hispanoamerican Ortography Contest)
In 2017, I was the Valencian Community representant for this tournament, and there’s a representant for each of the 19 regions, and there’s a representant from the Instituto Cervantes (kinda like a Spanish international school); it’s organized by the Ministry of Education
It consists basically in writing down sentences with words you haven’t really heard and are very rarely used, or maybe foreign words adapted to the Spanish spelling rules (e.g. writing “zum” instead of “zoom”, or even “güisqui” instead of “whiskey”)
I ended up 4th :)
We do in Catalan, we had a prior TV program about it (el gran dictat) and currently we have "Pica Lletres".
As far as I know it doesn't exist in Spanish because it's very easy to spell words (we pronounce it as we write it) except for some words with h, v/b or j/g.
Never did, when i heard it happened in the US and the UK it was new to me
Same here in Spain
The only challenge spelling bee would have is knowing if the word has S/C or J/G
Let's remember that USA is the origin of shows like Cupcake Wars or Forged in Fire (sorry I don't know if these are the original names)
Its a country where they promote competitiveness and make a competition out of everything, even if it's knife forging or cupcake decorating
Stressful, isn't it
We do :)
En castellano, la Fundéu y el ministerio de Educación hacen el concurso hispanoamericano de ortografía; si quedas primero, te dan 1000€; yo fui por la Comunidad Valenciana y sí que había palabras chungas que no tenías ni idea de cómo escribir solo de oídas
I always found funny that because Spanish is a romance language some of those obscure loan words are surprisingly obvious to us
When I lived in Ireland my classmates would ask me how some words were spelled
Then I would ask them how to say water tap or how to spell borough
Oh no
very specific examples of words that most people will never heard or use in their lives
My statement is shatered into pieces
I'll be crying over that corner
Also, s/z is not an issue if you speak properly
To practical effects it IS the same
You write it as you pronounce it and the other way around, therefore it's useless to have a spelling bee
That wasn't my point, but how easily you turn anything into a competition (I really couldn't believe there was a show with judges judging people forging knives lol)
And I don't think it's a bad thing either, I'm just surprised because in my country we don't have such a competitive spirit
Right now the most watched competitive show on our TV is an island where they compete to see who can last the longest without fucking someone other than their partner or something like that
We have a few but it wouldn't be that easy for you
Basically because of the RAE (royal academy of the Spanish language)
The RAE an institution whose primary focus is to protect the Spanish tongue
They don't like complicated spelling (they had a feud with Mexico for years over the letter X)
Many words are instead  transcribed to Spanish pronunciation
Sometimes with hilarious results, like GÜISQUI
Guess which word is that
A spelling contest of english loanwords with RAE spelling could be tricky
"Wrong, it's CEDERRÓN"
Hahahaha, I would surely loosely
I'm against spelling GÜISQUI and JONRÁN on principle
We elect the deputies from each province to represent us in the Congress of deputies, each of them is from a political party, and then they choose the president of the government
closed lists
you vote for a list
the next head of the new government is in that list
people from that list vote for the next head of the new government
new government
its not that proportional
regionalist parties see their suppor increases than countries that go for all the countrie in number of votes per representative
Hahahaha
61 MPs -> 30 Ministers
Basically every 2 MPs get a Ministry
To (somewhat) fix that you only need to put a national threshold
You need to have, say, 2% of the total of national votes to even be able to get a seat
Then you can get your seat for some provinces
This wouldn't affect big parties like ERC or PNV but the ones that only have 1 seat would struggle
Imho all this 1-2 seat parties are way to many
Same goes for our king
He also sign laws and can choose not to do so
Iirc the law just goes back to parliment and gets approved there, the Senate has the same problem: laws need to be signed by them but if they don't they just go back to the lower chamber and get approved there
The system is kinda broken hahaha
There is no pressure because if there was there'd be mass suicides given our country's economy
In Spain young people often live with their parents until late 20s or early 30s, and it's not uncommon for unmarried people or without partner to live with their parents even after that
It used to be, nowadays our families are happy just with us surviving all we have to face
I think it is about Spain, and pretty accurate
**Andalucía:** You know the stereotypes about Spain in general
Well, is those but more intense
**Extremadura:** Mostly empty wasteland filled with inbred people
**Castilla-La mancha:** No one lives there
And a lot of Don Quijote jokes
**Madrid:** Narcissistic assholes
**Castilla y León:** Mostly empty wasteland filled with conservative people
**Murcia:** *This place does not exist, do not keep asking questions, you would not like what is in such place
**Valencia:** The land of paella, currently under Guiri occupation
**Baleares:** Currently under Guiri occupation
**Catalonia:** Greedy assholes
**Aragón:** A mostly empty land in which everyone acts like Paco Martinez Soria
**Navarra:** Doesn't have any
**Basque Country:** Superhuman beings that speak in an impossible to comprehend tongue
**Asturias:** Where Spain came from, very proud of it
**La rioja:** Wine
**Cantabria:** PRAISE LORD REVILLA, GOD EMPEROR, KING IN THE NORTH, LORD OF SOBAOS AND PROTECTOR OF THE ATLANTIC
**Galicia:** Shithole full of rain, bagpipes, conservatives, drugs, and people that refuse to give straight answers to questions
**Canarias:** A tropical place that never shows up in maps and has people with really weird names
**Ceuta** and **Melilla:** Full of muslim people
* Galicians: Naive farmers
* Andalucians: Lazy and extrovert
* Basques: Brutes and terrorists
* Catalans: Greedy
* Madrid: Proud & arrogant
Andalucía: lazy
Backwards crazy about bullfighting and religion
Catalonia: nationalist assholes who think they're better than the rest and hate Madrid
Madrid: posh assholes who think they're better than the rest and hate Catalonia
Valencia: pyromaniacs who make the only true paella
Galicia: gray skies, green land, seafood
This is where Gallicians are raised
Once they're grown they emigrate to Madrid and spent 24/7 speaking to everybody about Galicia
Castille and Leon: Conservative people
Basque country: super strong neanderthals who make awesome food and speak the black tongue of Mordor
It's a mystery how they reproduce since basque girls never let you get laid with them
Probably spores
Castilla La Mancha: depopulated wasteland which very rural manners and way of speaking
Have a hidden humorists factory
Canary Islands: brown but beautiful people that speak like Caribbeans and only eat bananas
Murcia: They speak the absolutely most bloody horrible version of Spanish (trough Puerto Rico and Republica Dominicana are strong contenders)
If their way of speaking was a horse, it should be shot down
Except in Cartagena
Aragon: Strong willed and stubborn
They speak funny putting stress on every sillabe (ZÁRÁGÓZÁ)
Asturias: Green
This is our reserve to start a new reconquista in case the arabs come again
Navarre: basically like basques
They created the San Fermin conspiracy to get entertained seeing guiris get killed by bulls
Cantabria: Green
Castillians who think they aren't castillians
La Rioja: wine
Extremadura: roman ruins, iberian pigs and nothing else
Balearic Islands: this is where we grow Germans
Navarre is basically Basque but they aren’t actually aliens
Me has matado con lo de Paco Martínez Soria, cabrón.
Valencians also go crazy at the sight of fire
>Mallorca: Actually germany
Hmmmm
Andalucia is still the best region
Yes
But is not really part of the standard Basque stereotype
British be warned
What's this Murcia you talk about
For some reason, they are both cheap and well made, so it's typical for spanish tourists to load on towels over there
They dissolved already, and we Basques are not proud of it
Murwhat
What's it like to travel for hundreds and thousands of miles and still see everybody speaking the same language, and the same restaurant franchises
Basically the same (but opposite)
If you are close enough to a border, it is nice to easily practice another language, get groceries you cannot find easily at home (or the same, at a lower price)
And overall you see that people from a different country are not that different after all
(at least in non-pandemic times)
It's great
You don't realise you're in another country until you hear the people speaking or have to read a few signs
I did my Erasmus in Belgium
Went to the Netherlands a few times to see some friends, went to Germany for the Christmas markets, to Paris and Luxembourg
I'm from Spain which is a big country and we only have Portugal and France which are a bit far from my hometown
So I never appreciated that opportunity until this happened
From where I currently live (Madrid) Guarda, Portugal is about 4h driving, and Baiona, France is about 5h. Capital city hopping isn’t all that viable: Lisbon is 6ish hours, Paris is 12ish hours, Andorra la Vella is 6ish hours, and Gibraltar another 6ish hours away
It isn’t much for US standards, but it’s enough for it to not be something you do on the daily for cheap gas or something
One of my best friends lives really close to the border between Spain and Portugal, on the Spanish side
Both countries have different time zones so she will often go to the shops in Portugal if in Spain they have closed for the day
She gets bread from a bakery in Portugal, goes to the dentist in Portugal and gets all the Portuguese channels on TV
She says it's lots easier now she doesn't need to keep different currencies in her house
I have visited often and it's pretty great but I often forget to change the language if we go to a shop or café.
Yes I guess we do compare to other country
I'm from the South of France and we always went on holiday to Spain
When I was a kid I had a week-long school trip to Rome
We had exchange student from the UK
Even as a broke student I was able to go to the Netherlands by car and camp in Amsterdam with friends
Or travel to Ibiza one summer
That's pretty cool
Or go on a roadtrip to some cool music festival a few countries away
It was still 20 hours driving so not sure it qualifies as "nearby".
As an adult I often travel abroad for holidays or to visit friends and family
Well Spain is a special case, we're not only big (for Europe) but also quite isolated
If you're in Zurich you can drive in less than two hours to 5 countries
If you are in Madrid
zero is the answer
I would say it takes about 6h for the average spaniard to get to France by car
If you live in Girona you're lucky, if you live in Huelva
you're in for 10h.
Most people take an airplane to go anywhere other than Portugal or the french pyrinees
That said, planes are absolutely great
Tickets are dirt cheap and flights very short
I used to travel to Europe about 3/4 times a year
Any low cost traveller knows the city of Bergamo, you can go there for 20€ from basically anywhere in the EU
We had trips to Morocco, Iceland, Italy, France, UK, Munich, Portugal and more it was really cool
>100km gets me to one neighbouring country, 200km to another three countries, 400km to two more and 600km to two-three more
For comparison:
100km gets me to zero neighbouring countries, 200 km to another zero countries, 400km to two more and 600 km to three more (counting Andorra and Gibraltar)
I lived once 20 minutes away from the Netherlands and my ex introduced me to cheap dutch outlets and vanilla vla <3
Absolutely every single Spanish house has [windows shutters] and I just can't understand how this is not a universal thing
No curtain, no matter how thick it is, can give the light, thermal, and acoustic isolation these shutters give
Maybe fans
The ones with the fabric screen and wooden frame
Not that we use it every day everywhere in Spain, but in the summer it comes in handy, and I think every Spanish family has at least one in some drawer
Persianas
Window blinds but heavier and they block the sun really well
They aren't very common outside Spain or Italy
A [holder for the jamon ] and a [specific knife for it]
[Paellera
I've had toasters like that for decades now
It's pretty uncommon in Spain, but my wife got one years ago and we found it so useful we've replaced it every time it's broken
The Norwegian cheese slicers are common here, but pretty sure you won't find them in every household
Conversely I thought that can opener was a universal thing
In Spain, by law, a house must have windows shutters
>instead of putting it in the trash where it may Stef to smell
Maybe you see so few of these in Europe because of the different plumbing
In Spain smelly trash is not a problem because trash is collected every single night
I was baffled when I learned this is not a common thing at all
Very common in Spain
The porrón is something we consider to be very Spanish, but it is so basic that it must exist in many other places
There in Catalonia and in the rest of the country also, in the whole spain we call it aceitera
In the night
That's funny, because I realised this was indeed not a common thing was the first time I went to Berlin
Something you can lift with two fingers or break with a punch is not meant as a security device, and they are meant to be used mostly at night, not to block sunlight
If you just want to remove some sunlight, we have curtains too
Both bidet and moka machinez are very common in every Spanish house
True
I think it's a Mediterranean thing, sunny places after all
It may be mandatory by law here to have a bidet too, they're everywhere
I recommend you to visit other countries, I have several boxes in my kitchen as everybody
I actually confused the porrón with la bota, ignore me
But yeah, it is used in the rest of Spain too, not just in Catalonia
Have you never seen it in other parts of Spain, or have you never been outside of your region
(maybe you are very young
> Glad you guys in Spain also make use of it
Lol
Sure they are
Total darkness and noise and temperature insulation
No, it isn't. It's just cultural
I just bought a new flat and they give you the option but it isn't mandatory
Definitely seem them outside of Catalonia but for the places where those can be useful (outside work) botas are definitely more common (less fragile, better cooling)
Many people can't sleep otherwise
I had a GF that had to put a towel covering the gap under the bedroom's door and even made me to put the mobile phone facing down the table because the notification LED lighting the ceiling would wake her
The term Hernitcraftlike comes from a YouTube series called Hermitcraft, it's a smp (survival multiplayer)
And it's composed by a few youtubers (iskall85, Grian, Docm77
So It would mean a survival multiplayer server
I would really love to see those recycling machines in supermarkets where you put in plastic bottles and get some money back
There's nothing like it in Spain if I'm not mistaken
A better bureaucracy, Spanish one sometimes sucks a lot
[These patterned sidewalks omnipresent in Portugal (and former colonies)]
Lived in Poznań for a year and now I terribly miss public transportation, buses and trams (loved the tram system)
You don't have night urban buses in here, at around 23 you have to take a taxi if you want to return home
And they're not cheap
And also bus schedules between cities are awful, and if you live in a city under 30k inhabitants, forget about train station and assume you'll have like a bus twice a day and not even in time
Oooh, the farm code in Germany, where people from the countryside leave pumpkins, eggs or whatever they produce leave the goods up for sale and people just pick them up and put the money on the mailbox
There used to be, back in the day :(
Edit: for glass, not for plastic
>here in germany where governmental retirement schemes pay so little that it's possible to work a fulltime job for 40+ years and still having to collect bottles during retirement,
Are you kiddin' me
The bidet in my former house was the fountain for the cats
In my current house, I removed it when I remade the bathroom
That' wasn't a thing in Spain until COVID
Cash payment were discouraged and everybody accepted this
Before this, I only used the debit car to pay for fuel (yummy discounts), but since then, the only cash I've used in a year is for the coin-op car washing machine
>You don't have night urban buses in here, at around 23 you have to take a taxi if you want to return home
Poznan Has 500000 inhabitants
In Madrid we also have night urban buses, where do you live in Spain
>also bus schedules between cities are awful
And terribly expensive
Exactly
I was shocked when I found out that one can buy tobacco at supermarkets in Germany, and I began questioning why one can buy alcohol at supermarkets in Spain
The Bottle Deposit Scheme in Germany is a mess
You need space at home yo leave the used bottles, remember to take them with you yo the supermarket, if you don’t have a car it’s absolutely tedious to carry them with you every time you go to the supermarket
And bottles with Pfand are more expensive, it’s not like if you got money from recycling your bottles: you hire their bottles
It’s far more convenient to recycle your plastic
Yeah, but's still a nice way to encourage recycling
I'm from Spain where pay to use bathrooms aren't usually a thing and I'm a bit torn on the issue
On the one hand I appreciate not having to pay just to pee here
But on the other hand I appreciate not needing a hazmat suit to use a public toilet like in other countries
>Did not expect to hear that about Athens tbh
have you been there
There's an important dissonance between Athens and what people think Athens is like
Well maybe it was a bad comparison
I live in Galicia, and not even Vigo has night bus
I find that a way worse solution than just encouraging card payment (and the more modern systems) everywhere
We too went through rationing after our civil war (and for many years after, honestly) and it didn't change our food culture to bland unsavoury food
I highly doubt that's the reason
Many countries went through that or worse
Also many countries use internal organs and cuts of meat and still get many savoury recipes, we use them [too]
We have showers down here, you know
Not that it's excusable, but Vigo is half the size of poznan
Maybe it's a bad comparison, I don't know the polish public transport system
Yes, in Germany
You shower every time you shit
Well
Of course it's a hyperbole :), but Athens gets really bad
way more than people expect
I think beans and toast are one of the least unsavoury food that you have there, honestly
You're talking about meat cuttings and offals which honestly can be used in delicious food
You also have potatoes, radish, parsnip, berries, etc
so it isn't as if you live in a  desert
I've tried your Sunday roast and it's amazing, you have enough to create good dishes
Anice stew doesn't need much
Do you have bowel issues
No, but I don't always shit at a convenient time for a shower
The city center has lots of narrow streets and some buildings are litterally like 500 years old and dont even have elevators lol
In Europe a building from 1880 is nothing special, please don't be offended, I just mean it's really common to have older ones
There are cathedrals from the 1200 and they're really incredible buildings good maintained
And also if it does happen the wall won't collapse like it was made of papier-maché
Lately, a lot
Specially from the left voting people
This happened in our regional elections this year
For the generals you can't vote a regional party becuase it would just split the vote and give PP more seats so people vote either Podemos or PSOE, albeit reluctantly
When the regional elections came around nobody voted for Podemos and PSOE is not even 2nd
Also back in the day, where the parliament just was 2 parties + regionalists and nationalists (where absolute majority was achievable for those 2 parties) you just voted to avoid having the other party in power, as there wasn't such ideological variety in the parliament
We have some really shitty left wing parties
I mean
there isn't that much variety now either
You have PSOE+UP or PP with either Cs or VOX
Where I live only PP or PSOE get seats and I won't risk my vote
People, that voted for them, say that with the other party it would have been worse
I'm not really sure
On one side the right likes money and closing restaurants and tourism wouldn't be great
On the other side they are more authoritarian so maybe they wouldn't be so opposed to lockdown
Note: the opposition will always be against what the government is doing, even if they probably would have done the same if they were in power
The Autonomies are the ones that did most of the heavy lifting during the pandemic and the colours of the local government didn't influence too much how it went
There are legal procedures that only central Gov can do and some Autonomies have practically begged that they needed a lockdown and Madrid said no, worst case is in one of their own Autonomies (governments are from the same party) that now has 400 to 450 of cumulative incidence
Easy
Healthcare is run by the regions, not the central government
So you can always say it was the opponent or another party who did it bad in their regions
To be fair, as the situation and measures was different in every region, results are varied
Partially because the government itself finances those election polls, but there are other reasons
You'd be surprised how fanatical spanish voters are, and how corrupt the system can be
Bullfighting in Spain is, luckily, getting more and more unpopular and I think it's bound to disappear or at least stay just as a tradition without the current cruelty (avoiding the bull, veronicas and that but not killing it slowly)
The same for every animal abusive local tradition like El Toro embolado, which I'm not sure if it's already prohibited tbh
Also, the population is getting less and less religious and some festivities are losing weight, like midnight mas on December 24th, or the different saints days and the saints in general
Others are still relevant but lost some importance due to foreign traditions spreading
For instance, a lot of people share presents on December 25th instead of traditional January 6th, people celebrate Halloween instead of November 1st, but those still hold relevance nonetheless
Almost all religious traditions related to Catholic saints are disappearing, unless they are accompanied by a feast day and are an excuse to get drunk
For example, last February 3rd was San Blas's day, who is a medical saint and his [bread rolls] are supposed to protect you from sore throats
This year it was my turn to buy a bread roll for my grandfather, and he told me that in the old days grandmothers used to take their grandchildren to buy bread very, very early in the morning and then go to the church to have the rolls blessed, tied with cotton threads
Then they would make necklaces out of those threads and wear them throughout the month of February to protect themselves from sore throats and colds
My mother remembers doing that as a child with her grandmother and I didn't even know that was the full tradition, nowadays it's the bakers who take the bread to be blessed in church (if they get to do it) and then sell it in the bakery and thats all
With a bit of luck, Toros
Already out, throwing a goat from the bell tower to celebrate something
It is turning out ok
Bullfighting in many areas of Spain has already disappeared and rightfully so
If it wasn't for the bunch of rich bull breeders with political contacts and huge public funding it would have desappeared everywhere decades ago except for a few places such as San Fermines
\> midnight mas on December 24th
I always find it full of people, but maybe it's because the Sibil·la concert we do in Mallorca
In Spain the "three wizard kings" traditionally brought  presents
Nowadays Christmas is slowly but surely gaining territory
However "kings day" is still pretty important in Spain
You'll see nativity scenes around the country and many kids get their "strong" presents the 6 of january as opposed to Christmas
My town is actually famous for its real size nativity scene
Edit: "three wizard kings" is what we say in Spanish (tres reyes magos)
In English it's the three wise men
It gets even more interesting when you do it with Italians because they start with the opposite cheek
Can't count the number of times I've kissed random Italians on the lips by mistake (while not being drunk)
I never heard of the pins tradition (it looks painful
) and I don't know if it has to do with San Antonio, but it is common to celebrate "your" saint's day, it's like celebrating your name day basically
As you said, it's a second birthday (usually without gifts) and mostly celebrated when there is more than one family member with the same name
I only found out as an adult that the kings are not actually wizards (magos), they are called Magos because they were Zoroastrians and Magi were the "class" these kings belonged to within the ranks of Zoroastrianism
Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
In English they call them The Three Wise Kings/Men
It didn't work well for us, did it
Legislation is always a step behind social changes
I think it was declared inmateiral world heritage by the UNESCO some years ago
>I only found out as an adult that the kings are not actually wizards (magos), they are called Magos because they were Zoroastrians and Magi were the "class" these kings belonged to within the ranks of Zoroastrianism
Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
That's fascinating
And I bet it is related
>In English they call them The Three Wise Kings/Men
I'll change it ;)
> Not sure if the word has anything to do with our "mago" (probably yes
Yes, that is interesting
As you said Magi was the Persian Zoroastrian clergy
So as Greeks interacted a lot with Persians in history they took the word as a loanword
Later it would pass to Latin and we get nowadays Mago in Spanish
As Zoroastrian religion had a heavy imagery based on the sun and fire, over the time the word switched to be related to supernatural elements and we got mago /magia
Fun fact: when Al-Andalus was raided by vikings for the first time, Andalusí people called vikings "al-madjus" (the fire worshippers) because they were pagans and used lot of fire
This came too from Persian "magi".
Yeah, in Catalonia
I haven't seen one in my life, don't know how common it is
Real size
Nativities In Spain are usually miniatures
Like [this]
Thanks for the explanation
This is my town's ["monumental" Belen] for comparison
"I Danmark er jeg født" ("in Denmark I was born") is the no
1 patriotic song in Denmark
Some people (me included) think it should be the national anthem
The lyrics were written by famous writer H.C. Andersen
I will translate some of it:
> In Denmark I was born, it is my home
>There are my roots, there lies my world
>You Danish tongue, you are my mother's voice
>So sweet and blessed you reach my heart
>You fresh Danish beach
>Where ancient burial mounds
>Stand between apple farm and hops garden
>You're the one I love
>Denmark my fatherland
A fragment of the third verse also sums up the history of Denmark pretty well:
> You were once the ruler of the North
> You prayed in England, now they call you weak
>A small country, and yet around the world
>The song and hammering of the Danes can still be heard
In Catalan I would say that this s song is very well-known and loved:
[el cant dels ocells ] (the song of the birds)
And also [l'estaca] (the peg) with lyrics about Franco's dictatorship but nowadays used as an independence song
Basically it says that if we all fight for something we can achieve anything
The peg is something that keep us tied but if everyone pulls it will eventually fall down
For my country, (Spain), I would have to go with “concierto de Aranjuez” which is a classical composition heavily based on guitar, because I think it is internationally known as a Spanish composition and personally I feel like it represents musically our very diverse culture and landscapes
If I had to go for a “song” instead of a composition I would have to go with Mediterráneo by Serrat because of the same reasons but with the catch that it represents mostly the Mediterranean part of our culture which is not so influential on the rest of the country especially in the northwest
[This one
I'm from sapin]
"En livstid utan krig" then haha
Actually not a lie
just the opposite
The river Guadiana in southern Spain comes from ana (pre Roman for river)
Later, when Arabs invaded, they named it wadi Ana (wadi meaning river in Arabic)
So when you say "river Guadiana" you are literally saying "river river river"
"pueblo de islallana" (village of the flat island) also called the village of the 3 lies, as is isn't a village (legally it's another category), isn't a island, and isn't flat
Maybe not incorrectly but in Spain there are some weird names, like Ultramort (Ultradead)
The town is small but it is not a dead town
We also have Peratallada, which means "cut pear" or "slashed pear", but the place is not important for their pear-slashing culture (at least that I know)
Spanish explorers calles nevada like that because all the mountains with snow on winter
Also Santillana del Mar (Holy Flat from the Sea)
It's neither holy, nor flat, and it isn't by the sea
Oh yeah and Puertollano, the town of the 2 lies: not a port (puerto) as it's in the middle of the mountain in centre of Spain, and not flat (llano) for the same reason
not in al-andalus arabic ;)
&#x200B;
Actually almost every river in souther Spain start with wadi (Guad-)
There is no basis, period
National and regional languages will still be taught in schools, and there will still be a whole apparatus of public and private media, cultural institutions, etc
, that will promote those languages and cultures
For starters, what would the homogeneous language/culture be
People complain about the "4th Reich" and how Germany dominates Europe, but fail to realize that German speakers are less that 20% of the EU population
And they are the biggest language group
How are they going to impose their culture over the other 80%? How is any other, smaller, culture going to impose itself over the others
At the end of the day, there is no basis to believe that a federal Europe would harm our cultural and linguistic diversity
On the contrary, a European federal government that cared for, protected and promoted the national cultures (and it would to those things, be us, the citizens, would make sure of that) could be a great help to them
From unity comes strength, and you can do much more when you represented 500+ million people than when you represent 20
Case in point,[the EU is forcing streaming platforms to produce local content] which is surely good for our film industries
Does anyone think that, say, Portugal could enforce this regulation effectively on its own
>Therefore I wouldn't not like to pool my electoral power with them as they have very different interests to my own and may support laws which are not desired by my country
Tbf that happens inside every country too: the interests and decisions of certain regions can be detrimental or go against the will of others, just look at Brexit or the US elections, to name a couple
Well, catalan is an official language in Catalonia, (almost) all school is in catalan, if you want to get a job in the administration in Catalonia, you must know catalan, etc
Catalan is not in danger at all, or at least not more than it has been ever
It might not be promoted outside, but it's definitely protected inside Catalonia
As for culture, each region has its own holidays in which they celebrate their days, and on its own way
There are a few national days off, and then each autonomous community has its own own set of days off for that reason, so I don't think that it's specially in danger for that reason
It is true though that maybe some other minor languages like euskera or gallego etc are getting less use every generation
... except that regional languages are promoted and protected by their regional government, taught in the schools, and cultural productions in those languages is encouraged
You hear a lot of talk about how supposedly cultural minorities are mistreated in Spain, but, are there many European countries who can claim to have 5 official languages (with one or two more to probably soon come)
> One thing that could happen theoretically is that say 1 million swedes,  for some reason, relocates to estonia for example
And the same nr of  estonians to other countries
What is then left of estonia
The Estonian government would still be there and teach the children of those people Estonian, would demand knowledge of Estonian as a requisite for working for the administration, etc
In a couple of generations, you have a culture that, sure, hybridized with Swedish culture (if the influx of immigrants is a big % of local population), but is still recognizably Estonian
> Why do you hate you country so much that you want it to disapear as sovereign and have no longer power ?
For starters, because "national sovereignty" is a fucking lie
Please ask the Poles how national sovereignty worked for them in 1939
Or to the Belgians in 1914
Or to the German when they were partitioned after both World Wars
Or to your own country when Napoleon was deposed
Or to any of the Eastern Bloc countries, when the Soviet tanks came rolling in
Chile after Allende was elected, Iran after Mossadeq, etc
I can keep giving you examples if you want, by the way
No, "national sovereignty" is a lie that only only works for those who are strong enough to support that lie with hard power
If you are weak, those who are strong will respect your sovereignty only in so much as it fits with their objectives
If you are strong, then you can make yourself and your sovereignty respected, and force others to do what you would like
And I hate to break it to you, but: European countries, today, are weak
All of them
None have a fucking chance against the USA and China
And we all know the ways in which those two erode our sovereignty
So, it's either work to become stronger together and piece together our common sovereignty, or just disappear into the tomes of history as just another American pseudo-vassal
And by the way, I don't hate my country (I love my country and am proud of being part of it), just because I have different opinions on what its future should be than you have for yours
Thinking that only those who think like you love their country and everyone else hates it, is bullshit nationalism
> A vote with 40 million people, you have very more power than a vote with  500 million people who have not the same political interest as you
Don't worry, the [subsidiarity principle] comes to the rescue
Just as the French government doesn't decide upon your local garbage collection, the European Parliament won't either
Rather, the European Parliament will decide on those things which are so far detached from the citizens' day-to-day life that a lower representation ratio is acceptable
Things that don't affect you as directly mean that you can form broader and bigger political coalitions with others, and those coalitions will ensure your representation and your voice being heard
For example, in European foreign policy with respect to Russia, there are likely going to be 3 or 4 positions, at most
No matter what you think on the matter, you will find someone that supports that position
> Shouldn't the Constitution of the Weimar Republic prevented the takeover
The Weimar Republic had a lack of democratic culture and a lack of tools to protect their democracy (for examples, Hitler was able to easily suspend constitutional guarantees following the burning of the Reichstag)
They furthermore had to deal with the ascendance of fascism, which was even more dangerous then than it is now, because back then it was a new phenomenon and nobody knew what to do (well, within democratic bounds, that is
> The fact that 'currently the EU had a veneer of protecting national  culture' does not mean that once power is centralised that those  policies will remain eternal
Why do you trust the British government to protect your individual rights
It does now, and it has in the past, but why do you extend that to the future
Probably it's a combination of "I trust my democratic system and its protections", "I trust my fellow citizens not to stand that bullshit if it happened" and "I don't fully trust them, but recognize it is better than anything else".
Well, the same things apply here
With the added advantage that, since we would be building a new Constitution and government for the European Federation, we would have the chance to create a system that could assuage all our doubts and set up barriers to ensure those things are not breached
For example, write in the federal Constitutions that "the right of the member States to educate their children in their national language(s) shall never be infringed", that "the member States have a duty to safeguard their cultural and linguistic heritage for the future, and the federal government has a duty to aid them in it", that "the member States have a duty to have a public broadcaster in their national language(s), and invest X% of GDP in culture", etc
And then make those things into hard-coded parts of the Constitution, so that it is nearly impossible to change them
Hell, we could even have the recognition of the right of a member State to secede, as a last-resort measure if they feel the federal government is overstepping out of control
But at the end of the day, the best constitutional protection there exists is us, the citizens
So long as we truly believe that preserving our cultural diversity is important, we can make it happen
And I honestly think that would be the case
People care about their countries, regardless of their position on the European Project
So I would feel perfectly comfortable in trusting ourselves with that, along with some constitutional provisions
>It comes from a distrust of where things could go once that power is centralised, not how things are right now
I think a certain level of distrust on institutions/politicians is healthy, so long as you channel it into asking yourself "what can I do to improve the system to solve/mitigate that distrust". And as I said, I believe we perfectly could achieve that, just as the American Constitution managed to solve their own issues quite well, for example
Yes, of course
I think it should be done like it is right now with catalan
Every language should be mandatory in its region, just like now, and maybe make English co-oficial and make it like Spanish is in Catalonia now: we have a Spanish class 2 hours a week up to secondary education
But I think this is already a thing in most Europe, so it wouldn't be a problem
Of course we'd still have people trying to make those languages less relevant, but it can't be helped, there will always be people like that everywhere, sadly
Well, the post was talking about language, culture, literature etc
So I assumed you were talking about that
"Having a hard time" =/= "wanting independence". They can argue in favor of independence if they like, but they are NOT "having a hard time".
Sure, but again, I think you underestimate the capacity that a dominant culture has to assimilate others
Unless an overwhelming majority the population of Estonia is new immigrants, I don't see them displacing the local culture
Mixing with it, sure, but not displacing it
And honestly, that's good, since a culture that does not change over time is one that is dead
And if an overwhelming majority of the population of Estonia were new immigrants
well, sure, there might be some problems, but what's the chance of that happening all of a sudden, with no time to assimilate them
Like, sure, if I leave my house I might get run over by a car, but that doesn't stop me from going out to work/study
Same with this
Aww, thank you, I love you too <3
> Because we have a system which has been continuous for 400 years, mate
We are in the top few most politically stable countries in Europe
... and Brexit is showing precisely that
> I choose not to pool my democracy with countries which have only been  countries (let alone democracies) for a few decades
No thanks
That's your (elitist and arrogant) prerogative, for sure
> The EU is too much too soon for me
The EU is not changing to anything until the citizens decide to do so, but if you don't like its current state, sure
>  I don't trust the people who would be writing it that they would do so  with the protection of the interests of the individual nations
Why wouldn't you trust them
They would be citizens of those same countries, representing their citizens
They are not aliens sent by who knows what to destroy the European countries
They would be citizens not any different from the current MEPs or folks at Westminster
And they would be subject to the exact same democratic mandate of every other political representative, they wouldn't get to do whatever
So, really, why the distrust
> I'm glad we're out and good luck to the EU
Why, thank you, good luck to you with your "global Britain"!
But again, what are the chances of one million Swedish immigrants moving to Estonia
How would those immigrants live there, where would they work
And why can't that happen now
And why do you assume we would do nothing if that happened
Again, yes, we can set up the worst scenario possible and say "huh, how would you solve THAT
", but that is pointless because if you set up and unbelievably harsh scenario, then no shit that things would get bad
The only sane way of doing this kind of speculations is with reasonable and plausible, not arguing about what would happen if a million Swedes randomly moved to Estonia
"Well, if the world ended then that would surely fuck up your democratic system, so I think we should stay with feudalism"
> Compare that with what has happened in your country in the last 100 years and it seems little greater than a family squabble
I'm not saying the opposite xD God knows we are a mess of a country, but we take it with humor xD
> Are you stating there aren't dozens of constitutional matters that the  citizens of the EU would reject if put to popular vote
That's brave
No, I am stating that if we made a constitution from scratch today, the citizens would be decently happy
There would still be disagreements and compromises to be made, but ultimately there would be a nice thing coming out
Of course people don't like X or Y from their constitutions, but that's because political mentalities change with time, while (unreformed) constitutions don't. If we made a new one today, it would be closer to what we like today than the current constitution
> I don't believe the European Commission is solely interested in what the people of Europe want
You can choose to believe that (I personally think that Commission staffers have personal opinions of how things should be, like everyone else, but that's it), but the issue is that the Commission is not deciding anything, and never has
It is just the go-fetch-me of the Council, and little more
The Treaties only name her the "guardian of the Treaties", it has no other authority by itself
> Sylvio Berlesconi is just a citizen of his country
So is Viktor Orban
Both were democratically elected but not people *you personally* would like writing your Constitution
Sure, but you wouldn't (or I wouldn't, anyway) want Farage or Rees-Mogg writing the Constitution either
My point was that people in your country are not (generally) any more good or bad for Constitution-writing or democracy-keeping than those in other European countries
> The European Commission is not elected by the citizens of Europe
I have  very little doubt the people like Ursuala von der Leyen and JCJ will be  the types actually writing it
Again, for some reason you believe that a body with little real authority and power would be writing a Constitution in a fictional Convention, instead of elected representatives
And by the way, the College of Commissioners *is* elected
by the national governments
If you dislike that, and would like a more direct election, then I suggest you join the campaign of the European Movement, the European Federalists and others to have the Commission directly chosen by the European Parliament :)
> I just do not feel part of a European Demos
And that is entirely fair enough, and a perfectly valid reason for not wanting these things
Of course I feel different than you, but again, it is totally understandable and respectable
It is not a stupid question at all
In Spanish 90s usually people worked 9-14 and 5-8 or something like that, so there was full rest periods, but no free time
With the europeisation of the work schedules, is way more common to rush 8 hours straight and heat some food at lunch time
I personally prefer the European schedule, it unlocks the afternoons to develop hobbies and personal life
Sometimes yes, sometimes not
I’m a student and my official timetable starts at 8am and ends at 8 pm
There are free days but there are also days where you can’t even stop to lunch calmly
Workers in Spain complain about the split timetable: it is common that office and shop workers make a long pause at middays, and that makes that they work somewhere between 8am-6pm
People ask the government to regulate these horrible timetables so that people can spend time with their family, have free time, etc
Yes I have time for that but not so much for other things
I enjoy cooking in the evening so we always have a proper dinner with my girlfriend
For lunch I usually take 1h break and I either cook or eat leftovers (I make sure to cook more for that)
I also try to go to bed early but I live in Spain, and the curfew will be gone in a few days so we'll be back to the late life
I enjoy the late culture but I like to sleep
Since I started my remote job, I feel like I have much more time to enjoy the routine
I agree
Luckily this situation is changing in most office works
I had a job where I was working 8-13 & 16-19
It was hard, on mid-day I had time to go back home, make a good lunch, take a nap and go back
But that also means 4 displacements, two for going to work and two for leaving, means half an hour or two on the car
Per day
If you are 30 minutes afar from your job
And supposing that there is parking available
It does not adapt to city life at all
So that’s basically like revetlla de sant joan in the coast of Spain
We have the same tradition in the day of San Juán (Saint John)
It is actually an ancient pagan tradition that predates the saint name
Oh, I thought it was older
But it's on the 24th :(
Spain is really diverse so it's very difficult, if not impossible to say
Ceuta and Melilla seems like the most obvious answer since they are in continental Africa, but I haven't been there so I honestly don't know
Other than that, I don't think something like "normal" Spain exists
If we talk about extension, maybe one could say the north is more heterogeneous despite being smaller than the middle and southern regions in extension, but I feel like it's stretching it too much
If we talk about the stereotypical Spanish flamenco
olé, then Andalusian culture is the stereotypical Spain, but that's just the external image
I don't think there's such a thing like "normal" Spain, there's a huge diversity and that's one of the things that make this country beautiful, in my opinion
Canary Islands because they are in Africa and not Europe, therefore the climate is so different, and people's accents
Completely agree with you on everything
I agree
Spanish cities can have very different feels depending on the region but all feel very Spanish unlike maybe Ceuta and Melilla like you say
If anything there are some places like Perpignan or Bayonne that feel like they could be in Spain but only because they feel (and are) Catalan and Basque
I would say Cadíz definitely has a 'Latin/ Caribbean pirate town' vibe to it
I mean, I suppose that's because it's one of the oldest inhabited places in Spain, but still - I felt more like I was somewhere in Latin America or the Caribbean there
In fact, Cadíz has stood in for Havana in movies before, such as [Die Another Day]
That, or certain areas of the Canary Islands - those feel more Latin American to me as well
Madrid is ugly
Man, you need to visit Madrid again, it is fucking beautiful
>Maybe Barcelona the less Spanish because of how it's built
What do you mean
If you're referring to the squared street structure, there are many other cities and villages with the same pattern in Spain
You've visitied very few areas then lol
Cities and towns in every area have their distinct colour mainly because of the local stone or the tones of paint traditionally used in facades in the area
Idk, most Spanish towns and villages are white like this
>The size of Amsterdam however means that there is plenty of non-tourist city centre left, most notably De Pijp
Don't go around saying that too much or we tourists we'll find out about it and take it away from you like the rest of the centre
It means native population has stopped using their local language (Low Saxon) in favour of Standard German
Well, in Andalucía, not in the rest of Spain
To each their own, I guess
These ones are not fromAndalucia, yet the facades are painted white
Spanish absolutely should be
Mainly because learning other languages is hard
Because English is the lingua franca and most Europeans already speak it
I see no point in Spanish being the lingua franca when we already have English working fine
It'll be a waste of resources to put everyone to learn Spanish for replacing English
Plus points: We actually have one phonem per word
Minus points: Grammar
It should be Interlingua
Basically automatic to understand for Romance language speakers, probably it just takes a couple months to master it, and easy to learn for the rest
\-The UK is not part of the EU, no reason to maintain English
\-Super simple and consistent phonetics (it's almost one letter = one sound and that's all, no weird or random sounds, no clusters of silent letters, etc
the few exceptions remain consistent)
\-the áéíóú are not extra letters or have different pronunciation, the accent is there just to indicate the stressed syllabe
So learners have it easy to know how to say the words just reading them
\-Plenty of people already speak it outside Europe (even in the US there are plenty of speakers), so it's useful
\-Only one weird extra letter to learn (for no Spanish speakers) and that letter is just an abbreviature from latin (the scholars writing books abbreviatted the "nn" present in latin texts into "ñ")
I support languages where the spelling matches the pronunciation
**So you guys you can chose between  un caffè al mattino or vámonos de fiesta
Well in europe is a minor language with litle relevance so that is enough to say that it shoulnt be the european language
I would be fine with that
The phonology is almost the same as C
Spain Spanish
A lot easier to pronounce that French or English xD
And the soft d....
I still have nightmares about trying to pronounce the soft d.
Spanish from Spain is heavy in blasphemy too
One of the most common words is "hostia" (communion wafer) and expressions like "me cago en Dios" (I shit on God) are common
The selling point of Spanish is that our pronuntiation is straightforward, what you see is what you get, if you know how to read it you know how to pronounce it and we have the easiest vowels, just 5 of 'em
We even have grammar rules to let us know which syllables to stress, it's THAT easy
Mostly for us
French: the language with the most outdated and nonsensical spelling system after English
Makes sense
we don't even know how to conjugate verbs properly so we can't expect other europeans to learn
I was thinking “only 1% of the population speak it as the first language,” that _cant_ be right
then I remembered that the UK isn’t in the EU anymore
usually i only understand 100% to non native speakers hahahaha
Nah, if everyone learns Spanish, they can half-speak Portuguese and Italian
You don't have to
Most spanish speakers don't, they do the opposite
Half of Portugal lives in Luxembourg already so you'd have an advantage
(We want to keep the fun for ourselves)
Sure, but French outside of France was really only spoken by a small educated elite
Diplomats, nobles and scholars spoke it, peasants and workers just spoke their native language, French was useless to them
English is now taught in most school systems, and hundreds of millions of normal people have learnt it because of the economic opportunities it affords in a globalised economy and the spread of English language media
Yeah, better to be prepared
But I think that there is a difference now that back then there was not
English has been spreaded far more through the world than any other language has been before
And we are also far more connected
With this I am not saying that English is not going to be replaced eventually, but that is going to take a lot more time to happen so
If Latin stayed with a strong presence for a few centuries even after the fall of the Romans, with the poor communication between communities and the relatively small (compared to the magnitude of English today) number of people who could speak it and the low literacy; I personally think that English is not going to be replaced as the lingua franca in my lifetime
Moreover, in my view, the language has become a tool of international communication rather than a language that will fall when the superpower that made us start to speak it does so
But as you said, better to be prepared
Just in case
That's our politicians
You guys should revive your own language, is dying
And, well, Malta, the whole island, has the population of a city
It has no weight (and they also have Maltese) in this debate
Have everyone learn Basque, since it has no relatives at all in the world
It was a joke
were indeed not expected
"Hey guys, how about we let that french dude march here so he could take Portugal
Everything from 1700 to nowdays I'd say
What do you think about Napoleon invading Spain
It was a war of attrition that tied a lot of resources, for actually little gain since Spain was already fighting on his side

¿Nieva en La Concha
It has gone lower, but it's extremely rare around here
Yes, once in a while
We don't know where a surprising number of our cities names come from
For example, Madrid and Barcelona both have unknown etimology
However my favourite is this one
You know how the Abbasids dethroned the Umayyads in 750
Well shortly after (756) a blond guy found its way to iberia with an army stating he was the last Umayyad, Abd Al Rahman
He came to "inherit" Al Andalus and proclaim independence
The thing is
we don't really know for sure how the prince escaped or how he ended in iberia
In fact, we're not absolutely sure if he was really who he said he was
What we know is that he was a key figure in Spain's history
An amazing king without whom Spanish history can't be understood
Why the Muslims did not conquer the peninsula in its entirety and, moreover, they did not advance further north than the Duero River, which leaves enough space for the Christian kingdoms to have a good space with countryside, mines and forests to have resources to establish themselves
Also, the name Cedric exists only because Walter Scott misspelled Cerdic
honestly the myth for the flag is pretty standart i had heard several abaut, batle blood and then boom new coat of arms
also you could had been partners with the spanish empire if phillip II achieve to have a son with your queen that strange time
And the funny part is that most of his family was slaughtered by the Abbasid in a dinner very similar to the red wedding in Game of Thrones
The legend says that he was protected by his mother's Berber tribe in the Maghreb before going to Al-Andalus while the rest of the Ummayad in the middle East perished
So you say Scots-English-Romans instead of Rock-Paper-Scissors
>Why would the last Kharazmi Shah order the murders of the mongol caravan
,  don't caravans mean business
He thought it was a spy mission posing as a caravan, trying to prepare the ground for an invasion when the Mongols were done in China
So he nipped it, confident that the Mongols would be too distracted with the Chinese to react
Little did the fool know, the Mongols would invade Persia and China at the same time
>Why didn't Yazdgerd retreat the way The Bizantines did from the Arab  invasion
If the Arabs didn't succeed Iran would be very different,  perhaps Zoroastrian, having our own alphabet, being very distinct from  the rest of the middle east
Wait he didn't? Wasn't he killed by a thief in Afghanistan or something like that
And his son fled to China and became a nobleman there
Or you mean a more orderly retreat, setting up defensive lines somewhere
Some centuries before, Roman empire started conquering Hispania in 218 a.C and the didn't finish conquering the Basque  region until 19 a.C. It took two centuries
So that part of the country was always hard to conquer (reason why Basque language survived and other pre-roman languages didn't)
I guess they are some good mountains xD
As far as I remember, it means land of castles, curiously, the same as Castilla
This is bullshit
I went to public schools and there was much more time on the Muslim conquest and the Caliphate than the Visigoths and roughly the same as the Romans
And from everyone I've read until now, Andalusia gives them more time than other regions, not less
Probably
He was offered to have the white flag as his royal standard and keep the tricolore as the national flag, as a compromise, and he also said no
And when he died 10+ years later, an old drawing of a compromise tricolore with the Bourbon arms in the middle was found in his library
Most likely, he was open to accept the flag before 1871; in 1871, however, he didn't want to become king, but he didn't want to be the one to turn down the offer either, so he pushed the flag demand in order to force the government to turn him down and not the other way around
Well that explains everything
Yeah, tbh his life is ripe for a Hollywood movie
I can't believe he's been so ignored
From Syria, so not only Muslim but arab
As for his hair colour it's well documented
no, sorry jejeje
they didnt even reach that mountains, they didnt even conque the whole sub-plateau north
they didnt pass in that zone further than what is call "Sistema central"
The PM of a country with sea-going crocodiles, sharks, lionfish, ring octopuses, cube jellyfish, Steve Irwin-killing stingrays, went for a swim in the sea and never came back
It must been a Chinese sub
We are long due for a Spanish series on the Visigoths and the Caiphate
Unfortunately studios are reluctant to get in the Middle Ages and when they do they actually don't care for the history and just repeat tired tropes
I thought he was redheaded but maybe I'm confusing him with Tariq
"Land of the Goths" makes the most sense, it was one of the first places settled by the Visigoths and that they ruled the longest
Plus, the Franks coopting the local Gothic elites in the 8th century and allowing them to have their old Gothic laws in order to make a common front against the Muslims
Didn't your kings historically style themselves the king of the Swedes, Goths, and Vandals
Three crowns would be an ovious reference to that
I know Abd al rahman III had blonde redish hair
I couldn't find tariq's hair color
Abd Al Rahman I was blond I couldn't find any mention of redness
Was it Ostmark before Osterreich
Or the other way around
Most words in English that come from Latin sound really impressive for English natives
I tend to use those ones a lot because they're the ones more similar to the equivalent in my language, so they're really easy for me, while natives tend to think they're hard
I once ordered food in Hebrew, and the guys were shocked
I barely speak it, but apparently I’ve got a proper tel aviv accent
Another anecdote: was going to pick my tray from McDonald’s, but the worker dropped the Fanta and splashed a bit on me
She kept saying sorry and was very ashamed
I noticed that she was called Daciana and I said “Sunt bine sunt bine” (Romanian)
And she really got happy, but really really happy
And finally, at a coffee shop in London the waiter was called “Xavier Perello” (obviously Catalan), so I just said common expressions and he got really happy
As a Spaniard I hated phrasal verbs, because they are hard to memorize
So I usually learned a synonym
Some British people were surprised I knew some of them because they were considered too formal or technical for casual conversations
The point is the more formal or technical an English text is, the more Latin words are present
making easier to anyone whose native language is Spanish, Italian or Portuguese
*¡Que te folle un pez espada, con la punta bien afilada
(Get fucked by a sword fish, with the point well sharped
I have always found Celta's crest to be a bit dull
Maybe it's the colour scheme
From Spain I like [Albacete] and [Betis] signs
Definitely [this] (or something like that)
Generic and good vibes
I think it fits my city
Some soft Spanish guitar
Not something very energetic
A very relaxing melody
The kind of music you don't even notice its playing on the background
Nope, it's the background music what I wanted to post
Siesta time
Territorial stability :D
Siesta as worker right
no worries
Spain here, say bye bye to your record
2 years without a real government (no laws passed)+ 3rd year with 3rd elections, baby
I came here hoping that the top voted comment for Spain was not "siesta". I would propose other positive things we have and others might not know: live expectancy (2nd in the world behind Japan) or how positive or open we are
Glorious mi amigo
But you will miss on all the fun
Spanish hospitality
If you say "level of corruption" you're kinda implying there's some
You could add "or lack of thereof" to make it a little more clear
You're right but I'd say it still gets your message across better if what you're doing is discussing the high integrity swedes are regarded with
Idk it's not a big deal anyway lol
I'm not sure of the exact definition of "entitled" and have never heard of "helicopter parents"
Otherwise we have ***niños mimados / niño de mama*** \- pampered children / mommy's child
I lived 5 min walking from the Plaza de Toros de Sevilla and I have never been there
I used to be able to see the [Royal Palace of Madrid] from my old apartment (since moved to a slightly different area of the city) and I've never been inside
Of course I've been in the courtyard between the palace and the cathedral 1000 times, and walked in front of the palace through the gardens, but I've seen several other palaces around Europe, and I doubt the carpets, suits of armor, artwork on the walls and antique furniture are *that* different to make it worth waiting in line for
Maybe one day I'll go if I have a visitor who wants to see it
My ex lives less than 1 hour from Sierra Nevada's ski tracks and had never been skiing, which is specially weird because she's totally into rollerskating and extreme sports
I've always suspected she has some secret childhood trauma about skiing
Due to COVID lockdowns, I started to do some hiking in the forests and countryside around my hometown, and I've discovered a number of hidden small gems
This kind of stuff makes me think how inadvertently stubborn we can be
I live in Aranjuez (south of madrid) and I’ve never been to the palace, even tho its free on wednesdays
I live in Madrid, but never went to the royal palace
Ironically, I've been in in the royal pañace of more than 4 other countries, but not mine
Can confirm, I've never been to sagrada família either, it's just so turisty and at the same time so available that you just don't care
I've been to parc Güell a few times though, mostly to show it to outsider friends
That's the problem with Barcelona, I avoid it at all costs now and when I do I prefer to visit less touristic areas
I went for free two years ago
Sometimes they make a weird promotion/event where it's free (I think that you have to be from Barcelona's metropolitan area)
I don't remember the exact conditions but it was fast, no queues (you have a turn), 0€, it was nice
First time being there too in my life
I think that they do it in winter too, so there's tourist but not that many
But well now it's close anyway
Yeah, I meant the same, actually going in Sagrada Família
Of course I've been in the area and in front of it like a thousand times but I never paid to get in (there's a free day but gets incredibly crowded)
I have visited Parc Güell before they changed it (you didn't have to pay before)
Then maybe it's just with a DNI, I don't really remember the details, buy anyway it's the best way to visit if you're not a tourist
Spaniards do we have something for this that I'm not aware of or we don't at all
I'm from Spain and I also use one Mississippi, two M, etc
Your influence has been great so far
count from eleven hundred:
mil ciento uno (1101), mil cientgo dos(1102), mil ciento tres(1103)
(that is how I was taught how far a storm was, in seconds between lightning and thunder)
Nah, I count in seconds, somehow I learned the pause to make between numbers
Not in school but at home my parents taught me to count using thousands (mil uno, mil dos
Elephants, dear
1 elefante, 2 elefantes, 3 elefantes
I use Mississippi to count like in the USA, but I don’t know if that’s the majority here
I thought about it but then later I realized that I probably did it because of the song "Un elefante se balanceaba por la tela de un araña..." and so on
And I don't think that song was made for timing, but maybe I'm wrong
Yeah my mother taught me the Mississippi thing, but none of my friends knew that so idk
Well that could be a reasonable explanation, I never thought of it
I just tried it and it is quite accurate
Who knows
In Spain: Medicine, Mathematics, Physics, Computer science, dentistry to some degree, some engineerings, agriculture science
The worst: History of art, psychology, Spanish or English literature, education, sociology, or similar
Maths and Computer Science are very demanded right now
Other STEM degrees are also needed
Medicine or nursery have also good prospects
Well,i'm studying math and everyone is SO EAGER to tell me that it's a VERY usefull degree (i sincerely think they can't think of anything good about It Other than that), so i guess study math
The cut-off Mark has been rising like Foam the last couple of years and for the first time ever we're seeing recognition in Spain, a country with so much math legacy It could outweight half a nail
That's how the education system should work
Here we have It all mesed Up,
> wasting many years of your life to get a Masters in engineering if you don't give a shit about it and you suck at math
This IS SPAIN education system in a sentence
We have the same problem here in Spain, you'll have way more problems finding a job with some engineering degrees than with a plumber trade
Medicine and nursery are perfect to work abroad but here the situation in general isn't that good
Lots of temporary contracts that brings you uncertainty and economic insecurity
I would like to add statistics degree and actuarial science, I worked a few years in HR and recruiting these kind of profiles and they get a nice salary
Nice to know
I said that before that those degrees should be very selective and let in only elite students in fewer universities
We still need Historians of art as researchers, museum curators and such, but we don't need SO many
I love art but if I want to learn about it I can read books, watch documentaries or attend conferences
I remember being at the University of Granada and seeing History of Art classes with 200-300 students, makes no sense
Yes, but we don't need so many
There are 12000 unemployed psychologist in Spain
Sounds like hell, but im glad it all worked out
not in Spain, if you don't have a degree you can be the BEST in the world and still don't get the job
I knew a Guy Who had 25+ years of experience in his sector (IT related stuff) when he was cut down
He didn't have a degree
It took him 7 years to find a job
That's a good question
Most of those degrees are majority women, so it doesn't help them bridge the salary gap with men and female graduates have more unemployment and precarious working conditions, including working on things completely unrelated to their degrees
Medicine is also majority female but does not have that problem
Most of the high unemployment rate in Spain is because of the high proportion of school drop outs, nearly 40% of the workforce does not have any professional qualification
Spain has a very rigid and academic school system that does not provide solutions for students that are not suited for that kind of education, particularly makes from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
These students see there are work opportunities in the hospitality business, construction or agriculture and give up on studying
We also have in Spain a very high rate of student retention (repetition) that demotivate students and ends up being a disaster
The education system needs a total reform to provide individualized itineraries for students so they can achieve at least a basic professional qualification
Not everyone wants to be an academic, but as soon as you say that, a lot of people complain
There is also a lot to be done about businesses in Spain not wanting to spend anything in research and staff formation, they are very conservative and don't want to invest money in order to get more later
Well, the cronic unemployment of Spain IS very linked to the black market, a significant amount of people in spain work while "unemployed". Mostly in the agricultural sector
and the conditions of some of this "Jobs" are Really terrible
Search for Jornaleros if you want to know more
STEM
First to know IS that Spain has always sucked at science and math, they didn't have any type of reputation and It was even looked down upon
Most science majors ended Up as proffesors and the college system in Spain IS a semi-corrupt pudding, full of limpets Who Will retire when they're 85
However, there are a few science majors in the private sector
Math had It even worse
until a decade ago, math had a 5/14 as a cut-off Mark with about 80 students per year in the BEST colleges
that should tell you about how prestigious It was
Basically you studied math to become a teacher or a proffesor
This IS rapidly changing though, with math getting an umprecedented amount of attention, we have a 13/14 as cut-off Mark now
everyone is talking about math as the promissed land, but they've probably hardly ever meet a spanish mathematician
Engineering by contrast was pretty revered a couple of decades ago, so much so, that everyone got into engineering and after a couple of decades we had so many engineers they couldn't find any Jobs (yeah engineers were unemployed, yikes)
Today hardly anyone gets into engineering
it's a really hard degree and you have fierce job competition from every side
Technollogy has had a few nice decades and it's starting to take flight, with a miriad of students per year (lets Hope they don't end like engineers)
It also has a pretty good reputation
This IS also by far the degree i have less info about
So our E started soon and died, our T is promissing and Will probably implode under it's own weight, our S has a seemingly sane development with PLENTY of job opportunities
mainly out of spain, and our M was meager until 10 years ago and it's now exploding at forced marches
In conclussion, we have an uderdeveloped STEM, prone to explotions in popularity with very little lasting job demand for It
In words of my stepfather, we have now more forestal engineers in Spain that what We'll ever need again
In Spain choosing subjects outside of the scope of your degree is very strange
Most of the students in those courses, such as medieval art, or ancient art were History of Art undergrads
I don't think in the modern world universities have the same importance in spreading culture than they had even 40 years ago
Knowledge is more available and if you're curious there are many ways you can learn about things
If you want to do like in the USA where the first year of college is about the experience and trying different things that's fine, but spending so many resources in training history or art, or philosophy majors in a country like Spain with so much unemployment is not reasonable
Yeah, but we are dedicating public resources to hobbies
There are more things in life than what's practical, but there are ways to learn about something outside of the professional environment
Oh yeah, these are not medically trained and if they want to be clinical psychologist they need to do a master and some more testing
I agree with everything you said
I am entering my second year of college and I see so many people being unmotivated and putting leisure as a priority (partying all the time)
There's too many students and not nearly enough job opportunities that are worth it
Plus, a lot of people like myself need to go work / do internships abroad if they want any chance at success in their field
It's very sad
Yeah, but there's a Big difference between Spain and Germany, you have a work oriented education
For example it's not strange for a German to go into job training instead of college
in Spain it's still seen as a joke, something shamefull
Yo see this degrees as smth to do in your fifties, in Spain thats not how It works, few people ever go back to college
Art and history are full of people Who expect to live out of that degree, they study for profesional reasons
the thing IS there's no need for so many
Spain IS a country where knowledge IS venerated and practicality IS ignored
It's a Stark contrast with Germany where practicality IS always one of the goals to achieve
In Riofrio, Granada it is produced one of the best caviars in the World
>The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
You mean the *merienda*?
>The amount of rice we eat compared to other European countries and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
We cook rice like that too but we don't eat it as much as you guys
I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
>I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
Here it's an hour
>I think it kind of sucks but I suppose it's better that way in the long tern
When it was banned here people were PISSED, and it was the only thing everyone talked about
It was forgotten in no time, people got used to it and now when I go to a place where they allow to smoke (Like in some little town in the middle of nowhere where law enforcement turns a blind eye) I find it disgusting
That's very typical in Spain and it had to be regulated because of "overpicking" lol
We do that in Spain
I live in the uk now and whenever someone asks me how do you eat a particular thing, the answer is inevitably always “with bread”.
Even Chinese restaurants will offer bread and wine
You mean fried pig skin
In Spain we call them cortezas, they’re pretty common (we eat pretty much every part of the pig, nothing goes to waste)
In the uk they’re called pork scratchings, they’re a common pub snack
I can't tell you when was the last time I had soup
Okay, I don't particulary like it so I probably have less soup than the average Spaniard, but still
You mean within Europe, don't you
East Asian countries mist consume and produce it way more
Yeah, that’s how we do it in Spain too
We have those in Spain too, we call them garrapiñadas
Occasionally I’ve seen them made with hazelnuts too
In Spain it's merienda
Smoking outside is allowed
Smoking areas indoors were allowed for a brief amount of time, but it's been illegal for years
So like pork sashimi
we have it in Spain :D
Yup, raw pork is a no from me
You keep talking about the Inquisition and forget about how we collapsed native American civilizations and had a Fascist Dictatorship until 1975 okay
Andorra has been traditionally a hive of smugglers
During World War II they offered safe passage thru the mountains to jews fleeing occupied France, but once in the middle of the mountain they killed them and stole all their goods they carried
I'd say that is pretty well known at this point
Switzerland has much darker stuff though
Because no one considers Balkan countries innocent
Well, each of the 17 regions have autonomy
They have their own parliaments, enact their own laws, and have control over most of the matters: Education, Healthcare, Universities, Environment, Culture, Rural and Maritime matters, Industry, officiality of languages, regional infrastructure, some of them (Catalonia, Basque Country and Navarre) have their own police forces, Catalonia has control over its own prison system and Civil Law
There are matters that strictly belong to the State, though, like Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Energy Policy
Aragon, Valencia, Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia and the Balearic Islands also have their own Civil Law
The Canary Islands also have their own police force, while Galicia, Andalusia, Aragon and Valencia have autonomous units within the National Police
Welcome to the group
May I present our 17 Autonomous regions
We ocasionally call our system "asymmetric federalism".
We would have to fight back the invasion and win again
No Catalonian nor Basque nationalism probably
We would talk shit of the French government though
We'd be half invaded by the French, in the middle of taking Spain back
Well, definitely the Spanish economy would be better
Ah shit, here we go again (*grabs blunderbluss, grows awesome sideburns and hides in the mountains*)
Oh, no
That's how it all begin
Part of it (where I live) would be French, the rest would be a puppet state
Catalan independence problem would be France's problem
Well, it's a long story but basically Spain betrayed Portugal letting France go through spanish territory to invade Portugal and when France was already with his army inside Spain, they betrayed Spain and the spanish King was overthrown in an army coup
After that Spain fought back for a few years and finally won the war
I guess this was divine justice for our betrayal to Portugal xD Sorry bros, our king was an asshole
More like a cultural trait we share
We couldn't betray Portugal if we weren't allies, not even friendly neighbours
We were enemies with Portugal too
It was French-spain vs England-Portugal-Prussia
The last good Spanish leader died about 4 centuries ago, ita hard to do it worse
But we, as a society, are as bad as them
We've proved that during the last 45 years of democracy
Not only terrible monarchs, they were cowards and traitors
I cant believe a descendant of those pieces of shit sits on the spanish throne today
Well, I guess if you're comparing Spain to 90% of the world we're doing good, but compared to the rest of Europe we could do way better
Mate, I had an English teacher in highschool who wrote several times New York with a j. New Jork
New fucking Jork City
Granted it was not a bilingual school but you're doing alright, trust me our English education is based on repeating the verb to be and hope for the best
Yes, in Spain apricots, and most fruits, are eaten "raw" (I really don't know if that's the best word to describe it)
Sorry there must be a mistake
At 11:45
I look at my clock again
I went into the bar 15 minutes ago
After 4 bears
about anything I find near
Usually pizza
At 11:45 people just finished dinner
You still need some hours for getting drunk
I'm just not too imaginative
At 3AM kebab/shewarma (or kebab meat with fries and sauce)
If it is a special long night, then some churros at 8AM
I rush back home through the deserted streets in panic over a potential hefty fine
It's 45 minutes past curfew
I live in hell
Six *cubalibres* and it's 8 AM you say
I'm gonna go ahead and get some hot chocolate with *churros* with my friends before we all head to bed and sleep at least until 3PM
How so
You are served with "free" food with your beer in most decent places around here (it isn't the same in all of Spain)
Here in Andalucía every beer comes with a tapa, so if you are still hungry, just ask for a fifth beer, or maybe for a 1L jar which comes with a set of different tapas
Pfff dear god, should I change it
Or just leave it as it is
Let's be charitable, maybe 4 beers = 4 litronas
Surprisingly I'd say we too
Actually we sometimes eat some churros too
I always order it a bit bigger for the next day
I know I probably won't be in the mood to even put together some milk and biscuits/cereal
I do not know what is the most iconic of Spain, but these three are really famous:
— La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
— Plaza de España (Seville
It appeared in Star Wars II, it was Naboo)
—The Alhambra (Granada)
Just from Rome I'll take the Pantheon dome and the Colisseum, but Italy has so many buildings across the whole country that is hard to choose just one
If Freddie Mercury had wanted to buy my parliament building I would brag too
Being the background picture in many versions of Tetris helps
Not a building but if I had to choose a switz landmark I would say toblerone mountain .
Who would've thought that after all the shitty things we did to you, your iconic building would be built under the spanish monarchy
Could It be also Palácio da Pena
Edit: so apparently, the Belém tower was built way before Portugal was inherited by Phillip II
The construction finished in 1520, 7 years before the monarch was born
>Spain: Sagrada familia
Yeah
nope
it's kind of problematic
Spain has many cultural regions and giving the priviledge of "the country's building" to any of them would greatly upset the rest
No building can represent all
Even in the same autonomous community this could lead to problems
Castilla y León for example, there's the  catedral of burgos and the catedral of leon
let me explain
the rivalry between castilla and León IS so pronounced that there's no official capital
50 years into the democracy
This kind of thing repeats again and again even in the same provinces (for example Murcia, where there's a rivalry between Cartagena and Murcia, the city)
Sagrada familia IS specially a bad idea because it's very catalan from it's inception
Many will say It  should only represent Catalonia
If i had to choose La Alhambra IS a gorgeus place and (i think) waaaaaaay less problematic
It turns out the Elizabeth Tower is the same as the Big Ben:
As for the stave churches, I had never heard of them, but I've just googled it and I love them
Yeah, totally agree
Yeah, i've discussed several times this issue with my family and Friends
and we always get to this conclussion
That I did not know
>Palácio da Pena
I'm going to edit It, thanks
Huh, you're completely right
Do you want me to erase It, so nobody picks Up the false fact
>but more about what building foreigners first think of when they think about that country
I think not, read the question again
It's what people from the country think, not foreigners
It says:
What's the defining building of *your* country
Edit: Ok It can be read either way, didn't realize till now, that's a bit confusing
I would say the sagrada familia IS what most foreigners think of when talking Spain, but at the same time i wouldn't call It a defining building
So did I.
I'm probably moving away from the original question, but everything I'm reading seems so "alien" to me and I'm so jealous that I want to comment
Here it isn't very common to use a bike to move around, although it is a relevant sport, many people have road or mountain bikes and cycling clubs are very common
Cities have been trying for years to become more accessible to cyclists, but this is proving to be ineffective: bike-lanes either lead nowhere or share space with buses and taxis
In addition, there are no bike exams like in other european countries and, in general, there is no respect between drivers, cyclists and pedestrians (drivers+pedestrians vs
cyclists)
In addition, bikes are an object of desire for thieves: leaving your bike on the street, even with a chain, is in some places dangerous
When I moved to Granada to go to university I wanted to use a bike to move around the city and thus save money on transport
I left it in front of the supermarket, in a central area of the city, with a chain on, and in the half hour I was inside it was stolen lol
It was my first week in the city and everyone advised me not to buy another one
In 2017 the city council hired 1000 bikes for rent and basically most of them were stolen or victims of banditry and in 2018 the service stopped working
>Mountain bike
>The Netherlands
Barcelona resident here
It used to be like this, but fortunately things are changing fast
For this nice transition to happen, improvements in the bike-lanes infrastructure have been absolutely key
Bike thieves are still a problem everywhere, that's for sure
Regarding number of users, [not just Barcelona, but Madrid also seems to be another place where the numbers have grown drastically over the last years] Of course there's still a lot to be done, but I'm pretty sure there're more cities in Spain following the same trend
We're still far from places like Amsterdam or Copenhague, but the number of users are going up everyday and [COVID-19 seems to be helping a lot as of late]
Don't listen that guy, the meat thing is a big lie, also we treat dogs like a member of the family not like in other countries
Sounds more like a Western thing than something uniquely European
True, or just meat
All of them except from the Napoleon occupation I think
If we consider "free" to be living in some kind of constitutional democracy, the First Republic lasted from 1873 to 1874 before the monarchy was restored
The Second Republic lasted from 1931 to 1939 until it lost the civil war
The current constitution was ratified in 1978 after Franco's death and is in effect currently, although this time we still have a (very limited) monarchy
218bC - 476 aC part of the Roman Empire
476 - 711 Free
711 - 1492 conquered by the muslims (although by the year 1150 half Spain was already free and by 1300 90% of Spain was free)
1492-1808 Free
1808-1813 Napoleon's brother betrays and invades Spain
1813-2020 Free
Yeah exactly lol not occupied either but
"married" let's say
You can tell who controlled the country from within or from a foreign land though
During the Roman Empire, it was controlled from Rome
During the Muslim Invasion, it was controlled from Bagdad (at least until year 929 when Al-Andalus / Emirato de Córdoba declared their independence from Bagdad and became el califato de Córdoba instead)
During Napoleon's invasion it was controlled from Paris
The visigoths ruled from within, were born, raised, and died here, didn't pay taxes or anything else to anyone outside Iberia, the muslims had their leader in Bagdad until 929 when Abd ar-Rahman III proclaimed himself Caliph
The muslims were accepting orders and paying taxes to Bagdad
The spaniards during the Roman Empire did the same to Rome, and during the Napoleonic invasion did the same to Paris
Spanish kings nowadays don't, even if their lineage is french
But whatever, I'm tired of this discussion, if you want to believe that spaniards have been free since 1492 be my guest, and if you want to believe that they have been free since the roman empire I won't argue with that
Almost every single city in the UK
Idk why but i expected most of them to be beautiful since they were such a rich nation for centuries
Barcelona
Warsaw and pretty much anywhere in Poland aside from the hotel I stayed at since it just so happened to be one of the 10 locations around Europe where FIFA 13 was debuting ahead of release and Robert Lewandowski and a bunch of Borussia Dortmund players who I loved at the time there promoting it
Bruges
Glorified theme park
No soul to it  Long queues
Tourist traps wherever you look
Expensive
Small
Ghent was 100 times better
I hear a lot of people giving it a lot of shit but I actually liked it very much
I'm not a big fan of Paris either, but partly it might be because of bad experiences I had there (like getting lost and missing a train for example)
I've been to Paris twice, once when I was 10 and the second one when I was 20, my experience was much better the first time
I can’t say anything about the others, but I didn’t like Paris for other reasons
I knew it has changed over the years, not a problem for me, but I didn’t like the people, the unsafe feeling all around the city, the huge amount of shell games in the streets, etc
Technically "Big Ben" is only the bell inside the tower, which is named "Elizabeth Tower"
And imagine how disappointed someone would be arriving [not having realised it's being restored]
Everyone shits on Athens, but I really liked it when I was there
What other places do you recommend in Barcelona
I'm Spanish myself but believe it or not I've never been
I plan on going for a couple of weeks, perhaps more, depending on Airbnb prices
I've heard awesome stuff about it even though it's so touristy
Also lately there are many news about street thefts, some with violence, which gives me some doubts
I've only been in england and in big cities
Idk, i kinda expected more from a country with such heritage and empire and all
It's my fault i guess
Nope, is it nice
And i guess they weren't rebuil in the same way
Idk i just expected more
That's the word
Bland, boring, samey
Yes, totally
But idk, being the capital of a hugely rich empire I expected more
But that's just my fault
Oh, ok
I didn't know
What exactly consitutes the old city
El Raval and The Gothic Quarter
My (very raw) plans are to stay in Gràcia
I've heard it has a nice atmosphere
That's the Uk I was hoping yo see when i visitted tbh
Georgian style, maybe some medieval here and there
But i saw too much 60's architecture and ugly limitless brick terrace houses
None of those, but i get what you say
There very few nice looking new parts of cities yeah
Also i hate those thousands of red brick terrace houses haha
But that is just personal
I don't know
I just expected that a country like the UK wpuld have been more careful with their heritage but after a war that's what you get i guess
I understand that after a war the most important thing is to house the people but come on
Aren't there any new plans to rebuild all that stuff
I've been to london, bristol and sheffield(visitting a friend)
And yeah idk, i just expected more from a metropoli like london
Again, i liked it, i just thought it'd be nicer looking hahaha, but anyway i had a great time
Nobody would be surprised, everybody drinks cheap in Spain
That's why the streets of Madrid have become a rave of drunkard foreigners while we Spaniards are locked in our houses, unable to visit our own family because it is forbidden to go to the next province but for some reason it's perfectly fine to take a whole plane to vomit on our streets
You probably would get a "caña" (a 200ml tap beer)
It is between 1 to 2 euro depending on the part of Spain (maybe more in touristy places)
It's absolutely infuriating
[They're ignoring curfew] they're not wearing masks, they do not respect social distancing
They can do that in their countries too, they just don't want to face the legal consequences
They come here to do "ilegal" stuff that puts us all in danger, but it's not their country, so they don't care, they gather their shit and go back home without a single worry
In Spain, at least in my school, we talked mainly about Rome and Carthage, and briefly about ancient Greece
However and unfortunately, it was quite brief compared to modern history
IIRC, in high school we had like one chapter about Carthage an Rome, one about al-Andalus, and the rest was modern or contemporary history
Amazing empires and cultures like Sumerians, Parthians and Persians, China or India are not even mentioned
Not even Egypt I think
Cyrus, Xerxes, Dario
not even mentioned
And I'm not sure about Alexander
If you ask me, our curriculum is extremely flawed and ancient history is extremely underestimated
We did talk about ancient Jews and the tribes of Israel, but maybe it's because mine was a Catholic school
Ironic, we talk about Moses and Aaron but not about Egypt
Fenicians Ejiptians Greeks Romans Celts, Iberians, and the diferent people of the zone of Masopotamia
Romans greek egyptians aztecs incas mayans and some of mesopotamia
In religion class babylionians assyrians and persians are mentioned as well
None :'v
except for Romans Greeks, Egyptians and (a bit) Babylonians
Not the most original choice
History is underrated af in both my countries
Celts, Greeks, Romans
thats about it for basic education as far as i remember
others might be mentioned but not taught
More or less is the same in Spain, but add Carthago (Cartago Nova is the current Cartagena), with Hannibal crossing the Pirinees to attack Rome, and the Phoenicians (Málaga was founded by them, for instance)
And before all of them there was Tartessos, but we do not know about them
We did not study Asian cultures (China or India, for example)
Nowhere near that here
Rome is barely a couple weeks, maybe
ROME
For us, Rome is the base of our culture, language, law
More than a milennia of civilisation = 15 pages of content
Bravo
Absolutely, there was even classic lathin as an optional subject but no Greek
I remember having literally one page about Greece at school, and 0 at high school
We learned more about classic Greece in Philosophy than History
I see it actually changed a lot with LOGSE
We studied the Greeks, Romans and a bit of Egyptians, Babylonians etc at 6° EGB, which would be equivalent to 6° Primaria  age wise
Did they focus on Spanish history on the the years before 4° ESO
I know, it's amazing
I even think that your average Spaniard is able to name more Visigoths kings than Roman Emperors
And we had two of the best
I don't really understand it, al Andalus and Rome are probably the brightest part of our history, but we spend all the year with nineteenth century and Habsburgs
I really don't get it, maybe it's a way to make us feel more patriotic about Bourbons or something, I don't know
If I'm not mistaken, which I can be because it's been some years for me now:
2º ESO: one page about Greece, one page about Rome
3º ESO: I honestly can't remember
4º ESO: Universal History, but ancient times were nowhere to be seen
A lot of Illustration, French Revolution, nineteenth century revolutions, socialism, Russian Revolution WWI, WWII
1º BACH: More or less the same as 4º ESO I think
I remember because I had two different teachers but I think the curriculum was pretty similar
2º BACH: Good' ol' History of Spain for Selectividad
We call it "hache" and it's silent
Our letter J has the H sound, and we don't have J sound
In Spain, the letter H has no sound
For example: It's the same to say Hola (Hello) and Ola (Wave), the pronunciation is the same :)
I find it very curious that the opposite phenomenon happens in Spanish
Our "c" sounds like a "k", while the h softens the consonant (Ch, like the sound for "much" in English)
Edit: letter C actually has a lot of phonemes associated, so I removed vowels in the examples to avoid confusion
It's silent unless preceeded by a "C" like in its name, then its pronounced \[t͡ʃ\]
Actually in it's name you find both forms as the first one is silent
We do have the English J sound, in LL and Y, I think
I think J and Y sound a bit different, they don't have the same sound, but yes
We actually use “Ya” to say Yes in some especial situations which is pronounced like “Ja” in German
I have some preferences of course but I think every country has something worth visiting/experiencing
Belgium, I will never forgive them for embracing Spanish terrorist fugitives 20 years ago
Here we say la conchinchina, that is a place in soth-east Asia
We also have:
"Where Jesus gave the last shout"
"Where the wind u-turns to get back"
"On the fifth pine", sometimes made vulgar ("on the fifth cunt", and so on)
Apparently "[the fifth pine] was a lover's lane outside Madrid in the early 1700s.
"In the Cochinchina", which comes from the mid-19th century [invasion of Cochinchina]
Several involving "[the place] where Christ did X". The original was "where Christ shouted three times" in reference to a biblical passage but over time it became "where Christ **lost** X", and there are [several versions in Spain and Latin America] each with a different item: "where Christ lost his sandal", "where Christ lost his hat", "where Christ lost his lighter", even "where Christ lost his poncho" in the Andes
In Spain we say "en el quinto huevo/cojón", which means "on the fifth testicle".
En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme
In Spanish we sometimes say “eso está en Mordor” (that’s in Mordor) As default you are always in The Shire
Tombuctú in Spanish, same meaning
Other common choices include:
* [Pernambuco]
* El quinto pino (the fifth pinetree)
* Donde Cristo perdió el mechero (where Jesus lost his lighter)
* A tomar por culo (?)
Also: Honolulu and La quinta China (the fifth China)
The origin of "El quinto pino" is quite curious: in XVIII century, a series of pinetrees where planted in Madrid from el paseo del prado until nuevos ministerios (a pretty long distance) and people used them as a reference for meet ups (we meet at the first pinetree, or the second, and so forth) so the fifth pinetree was the furthest one
The lighter can be changed for some kind of shoe
A vulgar variation is *en el quinto coño* or *en la quinta polla*. In the fifth pussy or in the fifth dick
No, we don't haha
Yes, al Congo Belga
Estar en el Congo Belga sí lo decimos
I heard it before but the others are more frequent
No yeah, we participated in one of the wars
That's why we use it
El coño de la Bernarda,
población: 48 millones
*jaja
Nunca lo había escuchado
Porque eres persona joven
CoFFFFF
A guy asked me for directions to go to the guggenheim museum while being in a completely different city 300km away
At first i tried my hardest not to laugh but he then realised he had it mixed with the Niemeyer centre which was still in another town but 20 min away
We were having our traditional Basque festivity, in said festivity the city is visited by our Farmers that, normally, come with their Oxens as by culture, the oxen is a very respected animal here
Our bulls are very big and Oxens are even bigger and by bigger I mean those are some fucking beasts but gentle gigants at the same time so people from outside the basque country (including other parts of Spain) freak out when they find themselves face to face with two super buff bulls that weights up to a ton in the middle of a crowded street
That day (some years ago btw) there were a big concentration of international tourists and they all gathered around the oxens
There was a small group of germans/swiss or Austrians, theybwere accompained by another small group of Spanirds and they kept asking if they could touch them, when they were given a yes, they started peting our good ol' oxens and giving them food
Once their "i want to pet this dangerously looking animal" thirst was satisfied, one of them came back towards the oxens
He deadass slaped one of the oxens, turned towards his group and the spaniards and shouted:
*this bad boy can fit enough germans to invade Poland*
I laughed like the dumb basque I am, it was so random, I was so unprepared
When I was 18 I worked at the beach in my town in Catalonia, Spain
I had a couple from Madrid congratulate me on my flawless Spanish after learning that I was actually born in Catalonia and hadn't moved there recently as they thought
Thank you, I guess
I wish that were us
They probably wanted to get them from the (usually illegal) resale
An English guest at my hotel kept talking to me in Italian, even though I barely know two words of it and I always answered him in his own language
I would be even more bewildered if not for the fact it was not the first (or second, or third) time someone insisted on using the language of a country a thousand kilometers and one sea away from here
I hadn't heard of it, but I don't really watch the news a lot, I just visit an online newspaper
They had an article on it but I missed it
Yes but it wasn't an important event
In Spain you are allow to use violence for self defense in a proportional way and only when someones integrity is at risk
For example, if you get robbed and the thief runs away, you can't shoot him because no ones integrity is at risk
But if someone tries to rape you and you smash his head with a rock and the guy dies, then that is allowed because that saved your integrity and there was no other way you could have think of
If the guy doesn't die but it's knocked out and you continue hitting him until he dies, that is murder, even though it could be pardonated if you demonstrate you were too scared to stop hitting
At the end, it's up to the judge to determine if the violence used was proportional or not
Proportionality
That's it
You can't shot someone if he tries to attack you with his fist
That's murder, not self defense
This also applies to police
Even with a knife sometimes does not equal a gun
But it depends on the actual situation
yes, it's a difficult decision
I remember some news about someone killing another in self-defense stabbing him 20 times
It was difficult to demonstrate it was just self-defense without cruelty
I'm glad I'm not a judge, tough work
We do, it's called the [Guardia Civil] and it patrols in rural, certain suburban areas, and natural areas (except in the [Basque Country] [Navarre] and [Catalonia] where the autonomous police does) as well as in all highways, ports and airports
The [National Police Corps] operates in bigger urban areas and does passport control and issues IDs
General policing is also under the control of autonomous police in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre
Interesting
Spain's police system is the same as yours, no wonder we are neighbors
State Police (Policia Nacional) and Military Police (Guardia Civil)
Also, there is a third Corps named Policia Local
Think of it like a Sheriff or City Police
Guardia Civil is pretty much military police and some even sleeping barracks, but for the most part they work like normal police
They are assigned to rural areas and forestkeeping
Yes, as others mentioned, the Guardia Civil is a gendarmerie, a military police that mostly does civil policing
Then the Army have their own military police, BUT the Guardia Civil can also act as military police in missions abroad
We had to call the GNR when we were in Vila Real de Santo Antonio last summer
They were hot as f*ck
The word "ojalá" in Spanish that means "hopefully". Comes from "Oj Ala" or something similar in Arabic that means If Ala wants
The word "tiquismiquis", one of my favorite Spanish words that means picky or fastidious (especially for picky eaters) and that comes from the Latin "Tibi mihis" that means something like "yours mine" (like you have it your way, I have it mine".
The word "rebeca", to name a specific kind of cardigan (sweater) in Spain
The name came after the Alfred Hitchcock's movie "Rebecca" where its main character (Rebecca [Joan Fontaine]) wears one
The movie made it very popular in the 40s, so the people name it after her
"Estar alikindoi" in Málaga, Spain, means to be aware of something in order to be prepared to repeat it
It's from the times when British sailors employed people in the Spanish coast and they were always sayng "take a look and and do it".
futbol
at first when it cames the people use the english football
the RAE(the institution that regulates the language) propose to say balon pie (literall ball and foot)
the people said no and still using football
&#x200B;
so the RAE said "well you bastadrs, but at least we are gonna make it seem spanish"
and we write it as it sounds in spanish futbol
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
also a lot of words have strange origins from latin and conversions but are more complicated and technical than futbol
For Spanish I would add perro lazarillo for dogs that assist the blind, taken from the main character of [Lazarillo de Tormes]
are you sayin that when i wear a rebequita i wear somthing related with hitchcocks
Yes, don't know Arabic
The XIX century in Spain is total chaos
Tens of government changes, 6 different constitutions, tens of military coups
So we just simplify it a lot and choose the most important characteristics of each period
We have a very extensive content in history subjects now tht I think about it
It's very summarised and condensed to the most important bits and taught throughout different years
It includes:
-Different ages and characteristics of pre-history
-Basic things of the first civilisations (Egypt and Mesopotamia)
-General history of Ancient Greece
-Pre-Roman Iberian peoples
-General history of the Roman Empire
-Very summarised history of the Byzantine Empire during the Early Middle Ages
-Very summarised history of the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo
-Apparition and extension of Islam
-Muslim conquest of Iberia and history of Al-Andalus until the 11th century
-Apparition and evolution of the Northern Christian kingdoms until the 11th century
-Most active phase of the Reconquista both from the Christian and the Muslim side including main dates of conquests and which kingdom did what
This ends around 1250
-Late Middle Ages of the five Iberian kingdoms that had consolidated since 1250
This includes the Black Death, Aragonese conquests in the Mediterranean, the involvement of Castile and Portugal in the Hundred Years War, the bid for power between the nobility and the monarchy, peasants revolts, apparition of bourgeoisie as a powerful class, etc
-The Castilian and Catalan Civil Wars and the reign of the Catholic Kings
It includes the discovery expeditions of the Americas, with an introduction about the Portuguese discoveries
Up until then, only the most important kings are taught because there are too many with the different Christian and Muslim states
For example: Abderramán I of Cordoba, Abderramán III of Cordoba, Alfonso I of Portugal, Alfonso VI of León, Urraca I of León, Fernando III of Castile, Alfonso X the Wise of Castile, etc
Since Isabel and Fernando, all the reigns of every monarch are taught
-16th century: Reigns of the "Austrias mayores": Charles I (V) and Phillip II
It includes the conquest of the colonial empire in the Americas, the Reformation and the Dutch Revolts
-17th century: Reigns of the "Austrias menores": Phillip III, Phillip IV and Charles II
It includes the Thirty Years War and the different fights with France and England
-18th century: War of the Spanish Succession and reigns of the first Bourbons: Phillip V, Louis I, Ferdinand VI, Charles III and Charles IV
It includes the most important consequences of the Spanish involvement in the different European wars of succession
Now it's when it becomes tricky with contemporary history
-Revolutions: English Revolution (or Civil War) as a precedent, American Revolution, French Revolution
-Napoleonic empire, invasion of Spain, Iberian War and the constitution of 1813
-Summary of 19th century Europe: absolutist restoration, industrialization, liberal revolutions, unification of Germany and Italy, mention of the Crimean War and scramble for Africa
-Reign of Ferdinand VII with the absolutist restoration, the liberal triennium and the "dreadful decade".
-First Carlist War and reign of Isabel II
Establishment of constitutional monarchy, beginning of industrialization, different changes of government through coup d'état and their reforms and constitutions
-Glorious Revolution and the Democratic Six Years
Revolution and provisional government, reign of Amadeo I of Saboya, I Republic and fall of the regime (Cuban war, federalist and Carlist revolts)
-Second Bourbon Restoration: reign of Alfonso XII and regency of Maria Cristina, institutionally rigged democracy, industrialization and economic progress, colonialism in Morocco, independence wars of Cuba and Philippines (Disaster of the '98)
-Crisis of the Restoration regime: reign of Alfonso XIII, different crises and political conflicts (like the Tragic Week of Barcelona or the Disaster of Annual), failure of the system of rigging elections, coup d'état and pseudo-fascist dictatorship of Primo de Rivera
-WW1 and postwar period in Europe
Impact on neutral Spain
-End of the dictatorship and II Republic with all its turbulences
-Spanish Civil War and terror in both sides
-WW2 with a focus on the European theater
The Pacific theater is taught in like 3 pages with the atomic bomb and the rest is ignored
-Francoism: early (outright fascism, isolationism after the defeat of the Acis, autarchy, repression) and late (US alliance, technocratic government, opening to the world, authoritarian capitalism) periods
-Cold War
-Transition to democracy and '78 Constitution
-Creation of the EU and recent history until the 2000
Many of those lessons include sections about culture, art and society, too
Because it's so much content, it's usual that some final lessons each year aren't taught at all so many students have gaps
Spain, plan might get changed soon:
We had mixed world and spanish history classes where we studied architecture and art along history
One of the 3 trimesters was for geography (world or Spanish one)
TLDR is we had World and spanish history slowly and without repetition, giving a lot of value to art and such
Then you get a repeated and condensed class of Spanish history, no dates mentioned, the general ideas and concepts are mroe relevant
1st year: from early hominids, through prehistory, up to western roman empire fall
2nd year: through middle ages up to fall of Eastern roman empire
3rd year: was only geography iirc, but we apparently we had history and art up to the end of 17th century (I though we saw it on 2nd)
4rd year: we saw world history since 18th century
Didn't make it to WW2 tbh, we just said nazis and Stalin were bad and the class was a chaos
5th year (1st of bachillerato): nothing
6th year (2nd bachillerato): all spanish history condensed from prehistory to 1975 democracy
Only thing you get marks to enter to university
WW2 wasn't even mentioned, got like 1 line
No geography
Assyrians: look what a normie
America is a continent, United States of America is a country
Which is weird as hell
We don't use "the Asias" to refer to eurasia+Indoasian continental plate
They are a single continent now
And using America as a synonym of USA has been an error
Alienates the rest of the continent (or continents if we play geologist)
How would you call those people that live in America/"the Americas"?
African, European
American
Yeah, but how would you call the people living in that single landmass (ignoring Caribbean islands)
No, in most countries constitutions are over monatchs in hiersrchy
No because constitutions state very clearly the sovereignty of the country as an independent one
Castile and Aragon united with the Nueva Planta Decrees in the 1710s, not with the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand
Similarly to how the UK united with the Union Act, not when James VI of Scotland inherited England
At the age of 18 if you didn't have to retake any year of highschool
when you are 18 you anters university and it can long 3-5 years for normal career or up to 12 for medicine
This is the answer also in Spain
17/18 in Spain too
This gets little to no coverage even in Spain, so I dont really know what they´re up to
It should have more autonomy but if their point is having a different culture than the rest of Spain, the Basque have a better chance of getting independence
Honestly I don't think they will succeed in getting independence
They already got the attention of europe and the world and no real change happened
Don't get me wrong, many things happened in Catalonia (leaders in prison, protest in the streets…) but they need the support from other countries, politically and socially, and they didn't get it completely
Now with Covid-19 everyone has other issues to cover, even if the protest and pressure comes back it won't be a new thing and the momentum is long gone
well, the short version is that there's hasn't been much happening but politics showing their real faces and everything being confirmed
Long version:
This lasts months the political parties "pro-independence" (JxCAT and ER mainly) had showed in bright light that they care more about names and who does what that anything else (like, you know, the supposed independence) and the "lliristes" (the independentists that thought that everything was going to be smooth and rainbows because "we are in the right and Europe would not allow what is happening", "don't gove them the image they want
", "som gent de pau" mainly the ones that followed JxCAT, Puigdemont and associations like Assemblea) had started to realise it (the rest had known that since the beginning or since 2017
2018
) and everything is basically in Stand By
Among the independentist movement per se (as in: the people) the majority still supports the independence but know that at this moment we don't have the conditions to get it (as much as they/we want it there's nobody in the political power to be a leader and create what it has to be created to be an independent state and neither is someone there economically), this last part had reopened problems and divisions on it's own as the independentist movement is not an ideology in itself as it's just some common objective
All in all I think everything is going toward the left as new people (and a lot of them young) had started to take over, there's really a big difference between the older independentists (right and center) and the younger ones (leftists)
The olders are the ones that fit more in the stereotype (followers of Pujol in his time [nowadays no-one likes him], CiU voters, lliristes and all of that) while the youngers were the ones who participated in/take over Tsunami's action (not organizers, we all suspected since the beginning it was made from somewhere in ER) and Urquinaona's. All of that is stopped due to the inability to keep those things in the long run, principally
I could still say thing about this or that but as what is it I think it's long enough
The coronavirus happened xD
The PM was elected with catalan pro independency parties and "a negotiation" was agreed
(Negotiation being a sinonymous for just some meetings and the central government to offer a new autonomy status while denying an independency referendum
The catalan being pissed
but the pm already elected and everyone can play "is the other one fault" as negotiations fail and everyone is happy as their electorate is fine with no solution)
But not meetings yet (that were supposed to take place in March after the PM election in January) because of coronavirus
The current government has better relationship with them compared to when conservatives governed
So they don't declare independence or make illegal referendums right now
We have been busy with Covid too, but probably the independence situation will worsen again in a few months

More like they have finally realised something that every one saw a million years ago: that nationalists have never, ever, got the majority of the popular vote, that on this day and age there is no way that a region can rebel against the government of a European country, that the EU and the countries will never support a bunch of ultranationalists or any other kind of people defying the rule of the law in the heart of Europe, and that independence would mean the ruin for the region (see the three thousand companies, starting with the main banks and firms, that left catalonia during those weeks)
Hopefully one day people in catalonia will realise too that, much like trump or brexit, this too has been a fraud that only benefits the rich, used by the elite to hide the fact that catalan students have to pay on average twice as much as the other regions for university fees, that despite being the fourth richest region per capita it has one of the worst healthcare systems (by very far the most privatised, read: taxpayer's money for their friends) ...
Almost ten years ago the left protested all over the country
As a results of that, the leader of those protests is now the Spanish vice-president
Meanwhile, in catalonia, the fuck-the-poor regional government started waving the flag to hide its corruption and budget cuts, and here we are
Yeah but the Basque already have more autonomy than Catalonia, no need for them to seek independence
Just so you know what kind of people we are talking about, during the early days of the coronavirus that woman (puigdemonts minister of education, no less) made a extremely shitty joke on twitter (retweeted by puigdemont) , openly laughing at the people who were dying in Madrid, the region most affected in Spain (8500 deaths in Madrid, almost 6000 in catalonia) . I wonder if she still thinks that 6000 people dying in her region is something to laugh about
As a Spaniard, I wish the catalan nationalists were anything like the Scots, just a fraction as democratic, respectful, progressives and the luke
Instead, we have these regional presidents, vicepresidents and presidents of the regional Parliament saying, among many other things, and just in the last years, that:
-Spaniards are crazy, illiterate monsters
-catalans are genetically superior to Spaniards
-those who vote for non-nationalist parties (more than half of the voters) are not real catalans
-the leaders of the non-nationalist parties are pigs that should be exported to Madrid or Brussels
Again, this is just a fraction of what the ultranationalist leaders at the top of the regional government have said recently
I have never, ever heard anything remotely like that from the SNP, which seems to me to be a bunch of people who love Scotland more than they hate england, and not the other way around
We tried to invade Portugal, but catalonia was always part of either aragon or france so its not the same, besides, there are many people in catalonia that dont want independence, what would become of them
That right doesn't exist anywhere, though
Not in the UK, where it's the British parliament who decides if Scotland can vote
Not in Canada, where the supreme courted sentenced that Quebec could only vote with the federal government's permission
Not in the US, where the supreme Court, and more recently the Obama administration, made it very clear that the states have no right to independence
Not in Belgium, where about half the people in Flandes support secesion from a country in which all kind of referendums are illegal
Not in France, where the constitution forbids secession
Not in Germany, where the constitutional court sentenced a few years ago that the states have no right to independence
And not in your beautiful Italy either, where, like in Germany, the constitunal Court ruled a few years ago that the regions have no right to independence and that the referendum in the North was illegal
At least in Spain there is a legal possibility for the regions to secede
Sure, currently it's not exactly easy (it doesn't help that nationalists have never got 50% of the popular vote), but at least there is a legal way to do it
Because they were tricked by the bourguoise in the XIX century to believe they were better off alone
They essentially created an outside enemy so the workers wouldnt rebell against their masters
Just like every independentist movement in the 19th century in spain, but this movements (catalonian and basque independence) have endured until today, while others just disappeared
People there who want indepence have a pretty different culture
+the language isnt related at all to any european languages and its quite common in non-formal situations
Maybe illegal was  wrong word
I'm in favour of a Catalonian referendum voted only in Catalonia
But that one had no concensus in the Catalonia parliament with half of the parties against it
And in the day vote all anti independence citizens didn't vote because it was not considered a real one
So the results were heavily biased
A real one must be done some day, but the Catalan society must decide to do it and vote it (Spaniards doesn't matter)
You keep talking about Spain, as if it were your only enemy
Let me remind you that almost three years later still not a single country or international organisation of any kind have recognised anything
Let me remind you that the EU, the United nations, the US, China, Russia and every other major power, as well as the very symbolic Kosovo and Palestine, fully supported Madrid
Let me remind you that weeks before the illegal referendum the eu's main organization for democracy sent an official letter to Puigdemont, asking him to stop with his plan and obey the Spanish rule of law
Let me remind you that nationalists have lost all the six or seven cases at the European Court of human rights (with only one exception, when the court ruled against the European Parliament and Spain, and in favour of former vp junqueras
Days later, and following orders from Madrid, the European Parliament kicked him out of the Parliament
Not even a pyrrhic victory
Let me remind you that nationalists have never won the popular vote
You can blame Spain all you want, but the truth is that you are not fighting spain, but the catalan people, the EU and the entire international community, who, as this very thread shows, couldn't care less about your "oppression" . Good luck with that, my friend
Ok, I have a question
What do you do with the people that dont want independence
You force them out of their country
Specially if the percentage is like 60-40
Now that London knows that a referendum might be not as easy or favorable for England as it was several years ago, they're not letting Scotland vote
But you don't see the Scots breaking the law or disobeying judges
In Portugal regional parties are illegal
In Belgium (where about half the people in Flandes support independence) referendums of all kind are illegal, but you don't see they breaking the law
In Italy (where about half the people or far more than that support indpendende in some northern regions) referendums were declared illegal, but you don't see the far right Liga norte breaking the law
Something similar in France or Germany, whose laws make secession illegal under all circumstances
In general, since wwii, at least in the Western world, I don't think anyone has dared to disobey the courts (certainly not at such high level)
Now, let me tell you a little bit about these "Democrats" :
The draft of the catalan constitution for the new Republic said that "parties against the Republic and the constitution" (ie, pro-Spanish parties) would be illegal
Nationalists have never, ever won the popular vote, but yet they get the majority of the parliamentary seats (and thus the government) because they are the only of the 17 regions in Spain without their own electoral law, as the one they are using (the old Spanish law) hugely favours the rural, poorer, smaller, very nationalistic provinces of lleida and girona, over the unionist provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona (a vote in girona is more than twice as important as a vote in Barcelona)
Nationalist can pass their own law anytime they want to, but they don't have the majority, so between a "foreign" undemocratic law that gives them the power they don't deserve, and a truly democratic own law with which they would often lose the power, guess what these champions of democracy have been doing for decades
Several years ago, during the crisis, leftist activists hold a popular referendum on the streets asking people about the regional fuck-the-poor government's massive budget cuts
The nationalists sent the regional police to remove the ballot boxes, arguing that the referendum was illegal
When tens of thousands of people protested against the regional government's budget cuts in from of the parliament (before they were distracted by flags and nationalism to hide the corruption and the welfare system going to shit), the now regional president called it a "coup". Similarly, when thousands of (mostly leftist) people were peacefully protesting in one of the main squares in Barcelona, they were violently dissolved by the rwgional police so that barça fans and players could celebrate winning the champions league
Puigdemont and the rest of the nationalists (with the exception of a minor far left party) voted in the regional Parliament against the righ of Western Sahara and the kurds to independence, even though they are truly oppressed and being murdered by the thousands .
I could go on, but I guess that's enough
Anyway, these people couldn't care less about democracy
They are a bunch of Conservative, elitist, classist, ultranationalist, supremacist assholes who just want to enrich themselves (according to the regional government, about 60% of the wealthiest echelon support independence ; among the poorest, only 20%)
They are nothing but an even more xenophobic and totalitarian version of trump, who has never dared to disobey a judge (let alone the supreme Court) and has never called Democrats "pigs who should be exported out of the country" or accused more than half of the country (those who didn't vote for him) of "not being real Americans', like the top catalan leaders have done
They'd win
Catalans are Spaniards, they've never ever had their own territory
We either belonged to Spain or France
The situation isn't the same as in Scotland, at all
On the other hand I agree that we have a problem, created mostly by some parties to cover their spoliation over the last decades (I'm looking at you CiU no matter how many times you change your party name)
Until 10 years ago the talking about independence was residual but you start telling people that all their problems come from the lazy Spaniards and how we are superior a nv d more educated and
Rings a bell
Well, now we are and something needs to be done but don't get mistaken it's nothing like Scotland
It is sad, yes
I personally think Spain should have been a real federation after Franco, with states with more power
Like Germany
If Catalans could collect their own taxes (like Basques and Navarre can do for historical reasons) the situation would be better
PP (conservatives) fucked the situation when they blocked in the supreme tribunal the 2006 Catalonia Statute that had been voted in favour in referendum
They did it in 2010, and after that independism scalated
Wat
Bro, nationalists (jxcat, erc, cup) got 47
49% of the popular vote in 2017, and 42
62% in the national elections last November
That's not an opinion, it's just a fact
As for polls, the last CEO (made by the regional government) from last December, shows a 43
7% support for independence, and 47
9% against
The former number is even lower (about 30%, if I recall correctly, I can't find the poll on the phone right now) when the option for federalism is given
Again, that's data form the regional government itself
Secondly, only about 40% of the people voted on that shitty referendum (the nationalists, of course) so no wonder that you guys won an illegal election made by yourselves and for yourselves, lmao
And let's not forget that people from Madrid were able to vote 4 times (there are pictures of that), that people were voting on the street without any control, and that the whole thing was such a scam that even the 'international observers' paid by the regional government (which is illegal according to UN law, but who cares anyway) said that the result wasn't worth half a shit
Congratulations, you won one of the most useless, retarded elections ever
Finally, let's not forget that Spain has the same laws that every other country (actually, far more Liberal and permissive) , including a future catalan republic, whose constitution said that 'parties against the Republic or the constitution [e.g., pro-Spanish parties or organisations]' would be illegal
To be honest, our bros in Portugal have a similar law (regional parties are illegal, no matter how much they love the Republic), so you would not be alone, but please, spare us your speeches and sermons about democracy, because you don't give a fuck about it (just ask the leftist activists protesting against the regional government's budget cuts some years ago that had their ballot boxes removed by the regional police because, according to nationalists, 'the referendum was illegal')
That's the thing, Catalonia was never it's own kingdom or anything
Por esa regla de tres you most autonomous regions should also be independant, and most not even in their current form
Up until the 19th century calatuña was just another region, until the renaxença, which started as a cultural movement and was later converted to a political reason
There has to be a point where you can accept differences and yet still be the same
We could all be independant comunidades autónomas, and yet there's still differences between provinces, cities
Where would be the end of the hypothetical independence
The mentioned Statute is interesting because what happen with it shows a problem that Spain always has had, to avoid conflicts certain things/terms are intentionally vague so everyone can give it it's own interpretation and everyone is happy, reading about the Statute make some think it was a missed opportunity to have a real conversation and ditch euphemisms, now, reading that the participation to vote for it was at around 49% takes away some force of using it as an argument when it is mentioned as a cause for the current situation
Renaixença*
Man why are you answering me as if I was in favour of it
I vote for an independent Tabarnia, fuck it all
By the way, I love Spain even with all its flaws (just like Catalonia has many flaws too) we're part of it, we're a rich complex country and we should stay together
The independence would translate in riches for corrupt politicians and a lack of prosperity for the rest and getting out of the EU
There is no denying that the polls are very close, I never said otherwise
But it's not about the numbers, but the rule of the law that we have in Europe
If they want a referendum, instead of breaking their own laws and disobeying judges, they should go to the Spanish parliament (taking advantage that, unlike in most European countries, they have the right to exist and be there) and ask for a referendum
That's what the Scots did when they wanted to vote, and that's what the basque president did when he wanted to turn our region into some kind of Puerto Rico
Of course, we all know what the result will be, but that's how Europe works: EU law overrides national law, and national law overrides regional law
In any case, getting 45% of the popular vote, or even 99%, does not give you the right to break any law
Instead of doing whatever they want, they should start convincing the catalans about the wonders of independence
If they manage to convince enough people, it would a matter of time before they get what they want
IMHO, it's hard to blame the Spanish parliament for not kneeling to 4% of the national population, who are not a even a majority in their region
Sorry, i always confused the writing
Anyway, i figured you weren't pro independence, i was just adding more backround information
It's sad to see poeple being ropped politician's ideas (though that happens all the time)
Ribadeo was named after the place it was in "Ría del Eo (name of the river)/Estuary of the Eo" and that's pretty much it
~ Almuñécar/Sexi ~
Called Sexi by phoenicias and romans, the exact meaning is unknow
Called Almuñécar (al-munakkar) after the arab conquest, means fortress surrounded by mountains
Not my city, but is disappointed that the current name given to the people from the village is "sexitanos" and not "sexys". A missed opportunity
The first time Coruña appears in the historiographic registers (under the form Crunia) is in 1208, when King Alfonso IX of León decides to repopulate the village of Faro (which means lighthouse), and grants it all of the privileges and exemptions enjoyed by the cities that are under the Charter of Benavente
The name itself is a rather peculiar case as it appeared ex novo
The only prior reference is book IV of the Historia Turpini, where a number of populations conquered by Charlemagne in Gallaecia are mentioned, including a certain Crunia
Modern philologists consider that Crunia to be a mistake by the scribe, and that it should read Cauria
Málaga was originally a colony called Malaka (In punic: 𐤌𐤋𐤊𐤀, MLKʾ) , founded by phoenicians
But to be honest I have no clue what the name was supposed to mean
It was founded by the romans as *Palma* in conmemoration for the victory over the locals (As Palms were a symbol of victory)
After the fall of the roman empire the city was abandoned and when the arabs conquered the island they rebuild it and named it simply *Madina Mayurqa*, that means city of Mallorca
After the christian conquest they followed the arab pattern and called it *Mallorca/Mallorques*, *ciutat de Mallorca/Mallorques* or simply *Ciutat* (City)
In 1715 with the Bourbon forceful centralization it got its name of Palma back, maybe for classicism
Named after a Roman proconsul, Quinta Servilius Ceipio, who in 140 B.C. built a lighthouse at the mouth of the Guadalquivir to lead ships away from the Salmedina rock
The naming goes Ceipio > Turris Cæpionis (Ceipio's Tower) > Chipiona
The lighthouse was and still is very important
Throughout history many ships have sunk after hitting Salmedina and while no official expedition has been conducted, it's suspected that there's a lot of stuff down there from Roman times and onward
Many of the lost ships were carrying valuable cargo inland to Sevilla
It is called Royal City because it was founded anew by a king
Fuenlabrada
Fuente labrada
Powed fountain
I don't know if it's the correct word, it refers to a field where you have moved the dirt to plant things, so it's like you have done it to a fountain
San Lorenzo de el Escorial
San Lorenzo means st Laurent
You see there's a very important monastery of the same name which is in fact the reason this town exists at all
It was built by philip II of Spain after winning the battle of San Quintín which took place in, you guessed It, st Laurent's day
The monastery was built near the town of El escorial and so the name stuck, It literally means  Saint laurent of el Escorial
As for the "el Escorial" part nobody knows for sure
some say It comes from holm oaks, others darkness and others minning waste
It checks out, the place is dark, full of holm oaks and
well, i don't know about the third, It sounds similar though (escoria)
It was a roman legion camp, and it dropped a few letter, so it went from Legion to Leon
Madrid has a disputed etymology
The most accepted is that it comes from Latin "matrice" (water stream), later "mayra" and "magerit" in Arabic, turning into Madrid with the Castilian conquest
Another less popular theory says it comes from a Roman settlement called Mantua Carpetana, in honor of the current Italian city
While it's true that in the southwest of the city there are Roman ruins, we don't know for sure how big was the settlement, it's likely it was just a villa
Yeah it's important to note that León doesn't come from the word *león* (meaning lion) but Latin *legio* (meaning legion)
Although of course the lion is one of its symbols
To be fair the first thought I had was if it was linked to Falun Gong, I don't know which one could be worse haha
Finnish names just don't beat around the bush
In Spanish the verb is ronronear
In Spain, it depends on the university degree you want to do:
The Salamanca University is probably the most famous and prestigious since it's the oldest one, part of the three first universities of Europe
It's no longer a major school though
Attendance is quite low compared to others
It focuses on language and law/politics and is the authority on the Spanish language, same as Oxford is to English
Is La Sorbonne university good for social sciences
I'm asking because I'm an International Relations major, and I really would like to study in a french-speaking country
How does KTH usually rank
That's my uni
It's pretty recent compared to the other ones, but the quality of education is amazing
That being said, it's different from the other public universities because it lacks in certain areas
For example, the only science majors are engineering degrees
There's no philosophy or philology
I left the UPM to get here and I couldn't be happier
The system is tricky because of all the attendance/daily work, so it's like more like being in highschool
That was just what I was about to say
Definetly the best public university for social sciences
Also, it has very new and well kept facilities  (as it was founded in 1989) and it has the youngest teachers among all public universities
I live in Madrid -where the university is- and study in the UC3M, and I have to say -although this may be a relatively biased opinion- that the Carlos III University is considered to be the best public university here in the capital, especially in degrees like economics, law, international studies and other degrees along those lines
Hey I studied an engineering degree and two masters (one of them pretty techie and the other one not so much) at UC3M and I couldn't be any prouder of the uni
I still keep in contact with teachers from there and I even hangout with them once in a while
Great education, great facilities and great uni all around
Also I'm surprised the OP of the original comment didn't mention Politécnica of Madrid, of Barcelona and of Valencia
Tbh, in southern europe we habe been way too catholic for a long time so that kind of folklore is mostly dead
In northern spain some "celtic" folklore has survived and it's very similar from the basque country to galicia
Yeah, not really
There are traditional tales and stories and fables but that kind of like magical folklore is mostly non existant
As I said it survived in remote and rural areas, specially in the north
They exist, but most have been brought back so they are not "typical"
There you can see some examples
But as I've said, not really a huge thing
Nope
Some places have legends about ghosts and similar stuff, but nothing really unique to the culture, unless you count Virgin Mary showing up to random people at random places
I always forget about you guys ahahaha
So used to seen you inside the map of the ottoman empire
I was reffering to spain portugal and italy
Tiny country with very little historical influence
The relationship between spain and roman catholicism is much closer
Plus you can't base an 800 year war against islam without being a fanatic
Our patron saint is called Santiago matamoros ffs (that means Santiago the moor-killer)
What I'm trying to say is that pre-roman-celtic folklore kinda already died when hispania was conquered by the romans (it remained in some isolated places like the north) and also after that spain was one of the most integrated provinces on the (roman) empire since it was conquered early on so the change to christianity was very organic too
Then add the reconquista to that and there you have it, pre-roman folklore in very few places
It's not weird if you think about it that way, ireland was pretty untouched
*Shawshank Redemption*: "Andrés" would never have been sentenced to life in prison
Even in the 1940s. Well, I suppose he might still want to get out after doing 20 years, but there is certainly no way Brooks (Arroyos
) would have been imprisoned for c.60 years before getting paroled
*Twelve Angry Men*: We don't have public juries for most crimes and when we do they actually don't have to agree unanimously to give a verdict
So the movie would end with the guys walking out after 11 voted yes the first time
*Schindler's List:* No Holocaust here, not much Jews in the 20th century to begin with either
*Forrest Gump:* His mother wouldn't have to have sex to have him schooled because he would have been schooled by law at 6
However, he would probably drop out and take some apprentice job when he was 12
There is no way in hell that he would pass high school and college despite being a moron by playing football
I also can't imagine what could replace the Vietnam War experience
Maybe he can get deployed to Guinea with the army or the civil guard but the "crisis" there never got that violent
In fact there was only one dead in 1968 and he was a civilian
Pretty much every other popular American history event would have to be changed, but there is *Cuéntame* as proof that something in the same spirit can be done
If I were a vampire I would live in the nordics in winter and somewhere in the southern hemisphere in summer
>I used to think Los Angeles and San Francisco were pretty much neighbouring cities the way people in movies talk how they're close together, but according to google it's a 6 hour drive
\-Meh, this can't be right
*opens google maps*
\-Holy shit
It's like going from Madrid to the coast
>I wonder how other European people from larger countries experience that
A couple of thousands of turist drive every summer from Madrid to our little town to spend at least 2 weeks
It's a 6h drive and they only do it because they come with the whole household (complete families with multiple cars)
For a short trip (1-3 days) to Madrid we always take the plane but we are finally getting our High Speed Train next year (that's what we've been told)
Mind you
That doesn't make sense for America either
>a bad review on yelp
With the knowledge I have of my fellow countrymen I don't trust this kind of reviews
Why would I trust what someone thinks it's bad food or good service if I don't even know them
For someone's opinion to matter they need to be a) an expert or b) someone I know
The comic was set in a Inuit settlement instead of white, correct
You'd be surprised
And if they ask the number they'll also ask a shit ton of other data that is in the card so you'll have to steal the card to actually steal an identity
However by that point the card has likely been reported stolen already, and the police has your prints from when you made your first card at 14 or earlier, anyway
If many of them are positive I would think [this is what happened]
And if I see that they are Spaniards it's often «Best service ever
10/10
Will come back» or «2h waiting for table and 3h waiting for the food».
I don't really eat in a place that has hundreds of reviews because it's most likely a tourist trap or packed and I don't like neither
Nope
they will speak as they normally do but just avoid the strange words
In Valencia, if someone talks to you in valencian and you reply in Spanish they switch to Spanish instantly without any question or hesitation
It is very rude not to do it
In catalonia its supposed to be the same although by my experience and some others, they stick with catalan sometimes
Edit: right we're talking about dialects
Valencian and catalan can be or not be the same language depending on who you ask
Some words are different, which can be confusing but the real problem is the pronunciation
I struggle to understand catalan
And it's not something you can change
So at the end while we're supposed to understand each other, we can feel the difference and can be a bit difficult to communicate
I imagine that if someone realises they're speaking with a foreigner who's struggling to understand them, they'll try to speak clearer (clearer pronunciation, standard words instead of regional, etc
) as a natural and logical reaction
If they are asked to "speak proper Spanish" they'll slap you across the face because that is just rude
That's a lie, actors and TV hosts go to coaches to remove their accent (or otherwise they will not be hired, neutral Spanish is required to work on TV)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Very few are "allowed" to keep their accent on TV, like Paco Tous or Paz Padilla
The stabbing part made me chuckle
I can see it happening
Wtf is that language
I can only kind of guess what some words mean
Can you post the translation of that paragraph, please
Just to clarify, Catalan, Galician, Basque
are distinct languages, not dialects
I don't think you are saying they are not, and I imagine you've used inverted commas to refer to the Italian and German ones because they are arguably separate languages too (at least some)
There are diferences on working on a tv and walking in the street that a foreigner ask you where is the plaza mayor for example and when you are awnsering them been required to use a neutral accent
That's nothing that would happen in everyday life
They have to train their accent to be sure most people can understand them at a work aimed at millions of consumers (and even then many people don't watch Spanish movies just because on-stage recorded speech is not clear enough) or simply because they're playing a character that just doesn't feature their native accents
It is confusing, but no, they are different languages
I saw that post about Jewish Ladino too and was shocked that 1) I had never even heard of it, and 2) I could understand everything
Hahahaha, that is possible too, yes
What makes Catalan different than Balearic
Valencia
East Aragonese, Arani
Pirenaic Aragonese
Why are those not considered also languages
They share the same root
Maybe people need to learn to hear, because saying the accent is not understanable it's dumb and offensive
Catalan, Valencian and Balearic are all dialects of the same language
Pfff there are people in my town with an accent I can barely understand
There's nothing offensive in not understanding other people, what's offensive is to demand them to "speak properly like me". BTW, I don't speak with a "TV accent" at all
It depends on who you ask
And what if I tell you that there are studies that attributes basque to Iberian language
Where does fit the "iberian-romance" thing then
True
Also Aragonese language has plenty of variations, mentioned in another post
More or less, one or two per valley
In La França they speak also another variation mixed with Catalonian
But also there is not only one "Astur-Leones", afaik, there is one in Asturias, one in North Leon and other around Teleno
It was just a simplification
I ask linguists
Argumentum ad verecundiam
Some taxes and worker rights should be equal to every place

We've got English, but it's not fair nor optimal
Tax harmony
Try importing a used car to Spain
EU has a free market and you are allowed to buy foreign cars, but the reason it's difficult is because cars are not a normal item like food or clothing
Cars are very expensive items that have a lot of taxes associated to them and get used by criminals to launder money
Cars are also items that get registered to an owner and that require the owner to have insurance and regular checkups
It's only normal that when you import a car to Austria, you go through all the paperwork to make the car Austrian
The only way we could get rid of the extra paperwork is if the EU would use one EU-wide-system
I don't think this would happen any time soon as countries would lose their powers
I mean, I think it's a thing in more countries than it seems
I'm Spain, for example, it is a thing, but nobody does it
But I agree, it *should* be a thing everywhere
You're right, definitely [blue]
Totally
Latin and Germanic based, simple grammar, and intuitive word construction
Importing
Poorly worded by me
The used car market is small because people buy cars new and drive them until the car dies
So used cars are very expensive
Importing cars is a bureaucratic and costly nightmare
Uuuh
Empanadilla I guess
A small version of the empanada
Dough filled with almost anything savory and into the oven
Although I think the empanadilla can be fried too
But idk if those would be considered dumplings
I didn't even know what a dumpling was until I visited Poland
Quick question, what do you understand for a dumpling
because "anything with fillings wrapped in dough" describes both a beef Wellington and a strudel
I just looked It Up
they don't count
If you look on wikipedia our sections for dumplings IS increadibly short and pretty strange
I had never Heard of bolo de pote or cocido de pelotas till today
I Guess we just don't have well known dumplings
Empanadillas are listed as pies, i think along the line of english meat pies
And that feels kind of right
I don't even know how do you translate dumpling to Spanish
We don't have any traditional dumpling at all
We don't really have either (well, we have one example, boiled meatballs with breadcrumbs)
unless you consider fried stuff, then croquetas are a dumpling, and so are empanadillas and buñuelos
So does frying count
Pilota is very common in Catalonia during Christmas,  but I never imagined that it would be considered a dumpling
I mean it's meat with egg and flour
are then Croquetas dumplings too
It's not cocido de pelotas, in regular cocido (like the madrileño) you usually put big "meatballs" made from meat and breadcrumbs
Those are called "pelotas" and apparently count as dumplings
At least in Comunidad Valenciana, Cataluña and Madrid they are very common
I think they include them because they're boiled while croquetas are fried
Well, you could define It that way
but then you get some problems
A chocolate croissant IS suddenly a dumpling, but gnochi aren't, and neither are spätzle
Beef Wellington, meat pie, strudel, ensaimada, Apple pie, etc
they would all be dumplings
So you end up missing some clear ones and Including many dubious ones
Here IS my take:
I think the key aspect IS: boiling/steaming some type of dough with a roughly spherical shape, as opposed to noodles which are more elongated and thiner
You can make them with or without(again, spätzle and gnochi) filling
I searched for info in the wiki and the spanish edition of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen
However i think it's down to the culture and the definition IS a bit open
I mean the english wiki is way more open about the term
Funny, i'm from Madrid and i've never seen It, though my family IS from Castilla la Mancha, so that might be It
i'm from madrid too and have never heard of meatballs in cocido neither lol
it's definetely been too much time since i Saw them in a petty food war
>pan fried
I've Heard about this but i've never seen It
I think Gyozas are not pan fried if that's what you mean
They're steamed, that's why you add water to the pan
About the size limit
If you add it It works way better, i think because we think of dumplings as small
but it's still pretty arbitrary
Why would an empanadilla be a dumpling but a calzone miss out
And what happens with buñuelos
Or choux pastry
I don't think of them as dumplings
and then there's this:
....IS It a dumpling
Well i think that criteria is better, But there are dessert fillings
I've seen some sour cherry for Ukraine
You still ran into some problems with popovers or choux pastry and I've seen some monstruous dim sum in china
I STILL believe empanadillas (which i think in America are called empanadas) aren't dumplings
The consistency of the dough when fried IS too diferent to be a dumpling, not to Talk about making them in the oven
That's my opinion
Yeah
except empanadillas aren't boiled
The problem IS not the shape, it's the method of cooking
Pierogis are virtually equal in shape to empanadillas
But maybe i'm missing smth, i for one don't know of a single boiled empanadilla
Cooking method IS very important, the dough used to make strudel and spätzle IS almost the same ...you just add milk to the  latter one
and the end result IS quite different
I'd argue pierogi isn't an empanadilla
Yeah but the spanish wiki excludes frying from the list and in the english wiki empanadillas aren't even mentioned
>But they could be boiled, and then you'd have a dumpling like the ones you described
If they were boiled i would call them dumplings, but they're not
>Shape is the main difference between cultures, imo
Ravioli, which is the Italian reply, doesn't have a round shape, and that's just the traditional part of every place for what's the same cooking process: wrapping something
I added shape because if you consider spätzle and gnochi dumplings there's literally nothing else to save noodles from being dumplings
And you can wrap things in dough without It being a dumpling, strudel, beef Wellington
>Gnocchi, otoh, are considered dumplings in their English Wikipedia page
>Noodles can't be because they don't wrap the other food, which is the main idea imo
Gnochi don't have filling
And dumplings can get Big
>And then again, I still believe that what OP asks is what kind of completely wrapped in dough food is typical of other cultures, and not if they have exactly that kind of dumpling
I agree
The op said dumplings, but he/she really didn't mean exactly dumplings or at least he/she didn't look into what the Word means, which seems pretty debated
>Regarding the link, I don't think they call those big dumplings by the same name of the little ones anyway
I'll look into it
Do sincebollistas deserve human rights
You can also totally break apart Spain with Paella ingredients
Spanish omelette without onion of course
Also, those who prefer the Spanish omelette a bit raw or those who prefere it well done
I'll solve it for you guys: in Spain we call it "napolitana"
I'm not Italian, but I have to say that Panettones are way better, I love them
Panettone all the way
I don't think so, con cebolla ftw
Obviously not
I love raisins
And chocolate
salted chocolateraisins
Mixed with popcorn

What is that country that you have a huge crush and maybe you don't even know way
In my case is the Czech Republic
I want to visit so bad, I've started learning the langueage, listening to Czech music and I can spend a lot of time wandering in StreetView through its streets, despite the fact I have no conection whatsoever to that country in particular
Ireland, for sure
Maybe it's the green landscape, blue sea and grey sky
Maybe it's the culture, its history (pre-Norman Ireland is particularly fascinating) and especially its music
It definitely isn't the beer, that's for sure
Greece
I love Greece so much and even tried to learn the language, I think it’s a beautiful country and I love their culture
I hope I get to visit one day
Norway
There's this huge spanish youtuber/streamer called Rubius who also happens to be half nowegian
I used to watch his videos as a kid, back in 2011/2012 and his vlogs when visiting his family in Norway made me fall in love with the country
The UK
The architecture, the landscapes, the music, the humor, the food (yes, the food
It also helps that I'm in love with a Brit (5 years together and counting)
Leaving soon after 10 years here but I know I'll be back sooner or later
I'm actually enjoying learning it
Čestina je těžčí než další jazyky, které jsem se naučil, ale mám cizí jazyky velmi rád. Také, je pro mě zajímavé, že čeština je úplně jiný, a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost
I hope I didn't do too bad, and I hope to keep learning about your country
I'm from Galicia and went I went to the South of England it felt more like home (at least nature wise) than most of the rest of my country, so I don't expect Brits to come here, as they mostly look for the hot and sunny weather
Funnily enough, there's a somewhat similar law in modern Spanish legislation (it's even a meme between law students)
\- Article 612 of the Civil Code: the owner of a swarm of bees shall have the right to chase it over other person's farm, compensating its possessor for any harm done
If the farm was enclosed, he will need the consent of the owner to enter it
And yeah, the Brehon laws in general are quite fascinating
Poor girl is going to get her British citizenship removed for saying such heresy
I've learned that every time you have different clauses you have to put them between commas, but maybe I understood it wrong
Could you tell me how you would say this so I can learn the more natural way to speak Czech
I would rather preffer not to need a passport
I don't care, the spanish passport is the 8th in the list of best passports in the world, it gives me access to 186 countries, and the best passport in Europe is the german which gives access to 188 countries, so not a big difference
I would definitely go for the EU one
I wouldn't mind an EU one, but I'd rather have a national passport
I am definitely pro-EU, I'm glad the EU exists and that we're a part of it, but if I have to choose I'm Spanish before European
Although I gotta say recent events are making me feel more European rather than Spanish, so my answer might change in a year from now

Good but in Spanish you need to start the exclamation with “¡”
Sorry I’m having a bad day
We don't have that song
After all, it's an English children's song, not a Spanish one, so why would we have it to begin with
Pobre joan petit :/ no sabia pas de la seva historia
Probably is because is a song that does not translate very well in Spanish, the words are so long that there is no way to fit it in the tunes
Head - Cabeza
Shoulders - Hombros
Knee - rodillas
Toes -  dedos de los pies
It's Spain is quite popular to teach during English class for kids
So essentially has became an educational song to learn some English
To be honest, I didn't know this song had a 'Spanish version'. Although that seems to be a direct translation of the English lyrics (not even and adaptation to try to keep the rhymes)
If anyone had heard it before, let me know :)
Never in my life have I heard that before, and it looks like an abomination
All of them
Many of them, but one particularly cringing is Cristina Cifuentes, former President of Madrid region
She was a high profile politician, with a promising career, soft right wing but very beligerant and outspoken
And then it was published on a newspaper that she got a Master's degree in a very fishy way, without any evidence of  her role and qualifications as a student
She declined to resign in a ver stubborn style and while waiting for a hearing/trial, the press got access to a security video of her stealing in a supermarket
She is out of politics for good
A lot and still few
Accurate
Even Adolfo Suarez
>So much suppressed history too
I'm not sure how it'll work its way out eventually
It won't. We are like that family that doesn't talk about their feelings
We suppress everything and carry on pretending like nothing happened while deep down we hate each other
Suárez exploited people's fear of going back to fascism to get elected
If not for the stealing in the supermarket, she would be still in politics
Shit doesn't hit the fan here for other politicians that did the same thing
Hvala
Piedra, papel, tijeras, so the usual rock, paper, scissors
By the way, do you have a Game called gunner
You can either shot, guard or reload
Guard protects against shot and you need a reload before a shot
It's played in turns like rock paper scissors
Here it's rock paper scissors too but there is a version including knife and trash bin
There's also another game used for the same purposes which is called "pares o nones" (even or odd)
Both players have to choose either odd or even and they show at the same time their hands with some fingers out
They count the fingers and check if the number of fingers is odd or even, the player which has chosen that result wins (or goes first at whatever they decided to)
We played it where I grew up in the US
You’d have to double tap your thighs and then either shoot, guard or reload and so on until someone got shot lol
Not really, but you can divide the Game in sections
And everybody calls them turns
It's not a version, but rather a different Game altogether
Yeah you're right
It only works if n(n-1)/2n is a whole number
so n must be odd
De-industralization due to the European Union
Our economic model is based on tourism and services
We became a party and vacation place for norther europeans at the same time we were losing almost all of our industry
One of the background reasons is in good weather areas people have less tendency to leave the area if the economy is not going good
Think for one second of this, you are offered the same job (same conditions) in a rainy town in northern europe and in a sunny one by the mediterranean (you are not from any of them)
Most people will choose the second one
This different behaviour impacts directly in the unemployment rate
In Spain a lot of young people are qualified for professional jobs in STEM but the economy is centered around the service and tourism industries so not that many Engineering or Science jobs aside from Mechanical or Civil Engineering jobs and basic IT telecommunications and customer service jobs
Want to be a Software Developer, a Chemical Engineer, or a high finance professional
You're gonna have to leave to another country
Some foreign companies don't value the Spanish workforce enough to create non-customer service/sales jobs in Spain for several reasons (e.g. very bad level of English in older Spaniards, no proficiency with technology, etc)
It's not an innovative economy, a lot of people work government jobs rated per hour where they're often just staring at screens trying to pass the time
Doesn't help that our social security is spiraling out of control bc of the generational gap
Politicians who focus more on power than changing things, I'm frustrated to see my country let experts and geniuses go and then open shitty hotels on the coast so that the drunks of the north come to do what they can't do in their country
It's just the fucking politicians
More tarrdellas and less puigdemont, more Pastor and less casado, more rubalcaba and less Sanchez
And now it's harder than ever, separatists no matter how much they say they only think about independence (it's legitimate) but this greatly reduces the actions of government, and the "Spanish centre right" is the equivalent of the European far right, and the government we have it's progressive so I don't expect many pacts
My opinion is that politicians have 70% blame for the current situation
Btw: EU made us dismantle part of our industry to enter the EU
The lack of industrialization throughout the countries combined with an ideology that predates what "successful" countries are doing now
Before the industrial era large plots of land for agriculture and nice weather were the way to wealth, now not so much
Now beautiful beaches together with nice weather are the way to a somewhat okay life standard for most people
all in all southern Europe is just kinda stuck between what used to be an amazing past and an uncertain future
&#x200B;
EDIT: corruption doesnt help either
1- Because stronger nations that are also part of the EU eat all the cake
Most policies and politics are designed to fulfill the necessities of Germany, France, Belgium
Most are not positive for southern European countries, but who cares right
2- Illegal immigration
I think it's obvious that Mediterranean countries received the majority of the wave of people coming to Europe illegally
We have to feed them, dress them, give them a place to sleep and live
Even if immigrants get distribute between some EU countries (not all, because we all now that Poland and Hungary never receive immigrants but the poor countries got to do it because if not we get a sanction)
This means that every year there are thousands of people coming here
More people = less jobs = more competitiveness = the few jobs that exist are shit because companies know they can do whatever they want and people will still need those jobs
3- Southern Europe has become a tourism paradise
That's cool, it means a lot of the GDP comes from services (hotels, restaurants, disco
) But now other industries are low developed there's almost no jobs available
Doctors, engineers move to other countries (UK, Germany, France) just to have an opportunity to work in what they studied for
4- Companies are pretty smart and they know how to get the best of the law without breaking it
For example here in Spain a company can make you a temporary contract for 6 months, then they can renovate it for another 6 months, and after that they have to make you a permanent contract (by law)
So they hire you for a year and then they fire you no matter how good you are so then don't have to make you a permanent employee and pay the medical insurance, holidays, days off, bonuses
then after a month or two they hire you again if you are lucky (so them don't have to make a permanent contract)
Aside from this, all about political situation is not helping at all
I won't go into details but politics are shit
> 4- Companies are pretty smart and they know how to get the best of the law without breaking it

The "picaresca" is common rule
Unemployment figures are high, but nowhere close to the official ones
It's just companies (and, to some extent, workers) trying to evade taxes
Spain is in the South and the description of @RedKrypton is amazingly impressive
Partially, they just said that operators and engineers had to earn the same as in Germany so the Spanish industry would not beat the German one by prices
In that moment in Spain even the president of goverment was earning less or average as a German engineer
We didn't have money to pay the standard, so they ditch the industry and with it 30% of the economy those days
The goverment then invested in agriculture a tourism and saved the face, but some places as Extremadura are really fucked because they have no tourism and no industry
Now the services sector (banking) is growing in main capitals like Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, so they atract investment and the remaining and new industries are set up around them, this build a syphon effect that attracts young educated people to this capitals making the rest of Spain literally empty of these professionals, so other industries are struggling and they don't have people, some professions even dissapearing
The money goes centralised to capitals so the country side is very poor while most people live there
This makes the perfect battle field for populism and the rise of the far-right
I could keep going but I think you can see the situation
Is the EU to be blamed
Absolutely not
The Spanish politicians are as they didn't reindustrialised the economy once Spain were able to do it and so far they didn't rise salaries neither, so we are in the situation they wanted but now they are worried about the far-right because that was not in the plan
Often there is a **huge** language barrier
A Portuguese moving to Germany means he will have to start learning German from scratch at >20 yrs old
You might be able to get by a bit with English, but often people from the southern countries don't speak English that well either
From what I have noticed with friends is that they will move when there is really no more place to go
Or when they have been stuck unemployed at their parent's home for many many years
Maybe it's to build more buildings for more tourism
Such beautiful islands are going to end up being the hotel of Europe :(
Don't worry mate, the topic is hot
Imagine having a degree and a master in engineering and be working at McDonals for years
Then you said that :)
&#x200B;
I moved to London, but many are to attached to their families or actually have already children and it's too difficult to jump to other EU state
Thanks for the info (I didn't know it) ;)
I've just googled it and our National Statistics Institute says that the average monthly spending in food and non-alcoholic drinks was 142 €. Looks a bit low to me, I estimate I spend about 160 (not including eating out or ordering delivery food which accounts for 1-2 meals a week), but I guess that depends on the person
Accodring to Google, 70% of Spaniards spend between 150€ and 420€. The average seems to be 210€ (2525€/year)
From the OCU in 2015 the average cost of the grocery shopping (includes things that aren't food) is 415,5€ per month and you can spend up to 3
600€ more per year depending on where you live and shop
About 120€
That seems to be a lot compared to your average income
It's about the same in Spain
Nothing outright dumb but just understandable assumptions, like thinking all of Spain is a semi-arid plain while most of the north is extremelly forested
Well
This was beyond saying anything
[When George W. Bush Jr
painted a portrait of our ex-president J.M. Aznar]
Trump's speech is recognizable enough that I start reading stuff with his voice even if I've not been told it was something he said
no, only cittizens should participate
It's like the whole basis of democracy
Nope, and I'd support a further decentralization of the EU and reduction of EU powers over member states
This
My father has lived in Spain for 30 years and isn't allowed to vote whereas my aunt who hasn't lived here for nearly 50 years or my cousin who wasn't even born here can vote in the generals
Edit: For the people commenting that my father should get Spanish citizenship
He could do it easily enough but he would need to renounce his German citizenship it isn't worth it for the shitshow called the Spanish general election
I just think that you either say everybody can vote, people that are in some way blood related to someone that lived here decades or centuries ago and people that live here (for long periods) regardless of their citezenship, or you deny both groups their right to vote
then tell your father to get the cittizenship
he can
if he hasn't yet he's obviously not interested in participating on spanish politics
**Meter la pata:** To put in the paw - To take an incorrect decision

We have a very vulgar but funny one: Me cago en la leche
Literal translation
I take a shit on the milk (We use it to say that we are angry)
> Costruire castelli in aria (to build castels on air)
This exists in Spanish also ("Construir castillos en el aire")
I've even heard it in Catalan ("Construir castells en l'aire")
Both might come from the Italian one
According to this [source] (sorry, only in Spanish), it comes from the French and it exists in multiple languages, not just the Romance ones
I could get by in almost all Romance language countries but Romania and Italy would be a challenge
I don't know how far my German is going to get me in the Netherlands
Switzerland wouldn't be that hard but my French isn't the best and the German speaking Swiss can make if very hard to understand them
I guess I'd be able to communicate with italian and portuguese people, but other than that I'd need to switch to English
I could go to Italy and Portugal without speaking English and I am sure we would understand each other perfectly
With a Latin based language you can have a conversation in Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy (possibly Romania too)
Do you think France is easier than Italy
I got by in Italy just fine
I haven't been to France but I assume it would be harder
Yes
Everybody here says I'm going to do my Erasmus in Itlay because it's just like Spanish and then nobody passes the language test
I don't know, French and Romanian are way harder to understand than Portuguese and Italian for a spaniard
But maybe with short words and using the hands we could get to understand each other
You just start driving until you find out you're in another country
Seriously, might be some few random controls in the border, but nothing special, normally it's just like going to another city in your own country
You can't even place exactly where the border is if you don't spot the sign that says *FRANCE*
Completely seamles
Just pass as if just changes the language
I like to have picters I took myself that remind me of cool places/moments, or sometimes customizer my phone with a theme from a videogame/show
So right now I have an ATLA lock screen and my home screen is a picture of a snowy lake in Sweden, from my Erasmus exchange
On my desktop screens I have pictures from a very cool sunset, one of them has a picture of some grapes growing in a vine covered in sunlight, and the other a misty hilltop bathed in shadows
[This for my phone, centered]
Phone: My dog locked and me and my fiancee when unlocked
PC: My dog
On my desktop and laptop: Windows 10 default background pre 1903 update, the one with more deep blue, I hate the new light blue one
Beer, chocolate, waffle, french fries, tintin, bad roads, no government most of the time, hazaard and Courtois, Brussels and the EU, Congo genocide
Ben L.G. Weyts, the N-VA flemish minister for animal welfare and a bunch of other things
How divided they actually are, politically speaking
I've heard in the last elections they had, half of the country voted far-right and the other half far-left
French fries
Nothing to be honest
Redhead big boob's with a moustache
I'm not sure why I have this picture
Oh come on
Portugal and France mostly
As a Spanish, Spain
The most joked country in Spain is Catalonia
We kinda have a love/hate relationship with France
Mostly hate
So yeah, they get shat on
Probably Spain itself (we see ourselves as a bad country) and the countries giving us tourists (Germany, France and Britain)
Or ourselves
I think is more about ourselves haha
Also British *balconers*
Agree
And before Murcia was popular, it was Andalusians and Lepe xDD
Teruel existe también
It was a prank, bro
Right now it says 17,7º, which is indeed chilly
Anything under 19º feels cold because we have a high humidity, and in this apartment we only get like and hour and a half of direct sun every day
I should turn on the heating but we have an old A/C that makes a lot of noise and consumes a lot of power, and it's not like I'm freezing anyway (that's what a good, thick cotton robe is for)
18,5°C in my living room
Something between 18°C and 20°C it's OK for me
20º
>what do you consider to be a cold room
Depends on what I am doing, what I am wearing
If I am sitting in front of my computer's screen, for many hours, less than 20º feels cold
24C. 19C and below I'd consider a little cold, 20C is ok
20,8C
I feel some disconfort so I just adjusted the thermostat to 23C (like 30 minutes before reading this
21,2 ºC according to the thermometer
Decent room temperature, I'd say anything under 20 is cold, 21-23 is ideal, 24 and more is hot
I aim for 21 ºC in my room in winter (not easy because we have some shitty storage heaters)
The rest of the house is probably at 18 at best, but I don't mind it much as I live alone and spend most of the day in my room anyway
Thermostats aren't very precise in general, and their location within the room also affects a lot to the measure
20-21 is ideal for me when I'm moving, but if I'm just watching tv I only feel confortable from 23
When I'm working in the desk I'm ok if it's 22-23
Wait, it is part of Schengen
Do you mean any european can go there to live and work without a visa
Yes but not because of Schengen, which is only about borderless travel
Me, a wanna-be Scandinavian, using these words
Same structure as in spanish, «vergüenza ajena».
I am curious, is there any reason for the use of those two nationalities
Seems a fun story
Can’t understand a thing but I can recognise a sort of Navy SEAL copypasta when I see one
Am I right
Lo sé, el comentario era más por hacer la gracia que por otra cosa
In the Canaries, very
You can go for a stroll or walk the dog at 2am easily
Before covid
Now there's a curfew from 11pm
In addition, I have many Latin American friends that when I asked what is what they like the most from Spain, the reply is how safe it is
In Murcia (460k) there are some very bad areas that you should certainly avoid
Mainly because of drug dealing, social marginality, and ethnic conflictivity, those places are indeed dangerous
Outside of those neighbourhoods the city is mostly safe
There's still a chance to get mugged but nothing special I guess
I have lived in Madrid for 6 years (in the central area, inside the M-30), and exceptuating a friend that's been pick pocketed, no incidents at all
I usually came home drunk as one can get at 4 am in the morning and nothing never happened to me
The neighbourhood in the outskirts probably are a different story, but I think most of the fame they have of being dangerous come from the 80s when they were actually dangerous
In my hometown (75k), also nothing happened, just being "mugged" by some gypsy children when I was like 13, but nothing serious
Now living in Coruña (230k), there is a curfew so I didn't really walked late at night but never felt unsafe at the city
Plus, the city is so dense that I think I've never been alone at street so far
When I did my Erasmus in Germany tho, I didn't feel unsafe and nothing happened to me, but the lack of light of some places was really disturbing to me, so it felt a little scary
I'm talking as a woman
I've never felt unsafe here in Spain (except in Barcelona, I'd never comeback there because of that anyway)
Where I live I've walked outside happily in the middle of the night with a bunch of girl friends, and none felt unsafe
And it's not even like I live in a rural place far away from everyone, I'm from the Canary Islands lol
Pretty walkable
One of the things that I've noticed is that abroad the streetlamps lighten just a small spot around them
Which leaves spots of darkness where you can't see what's in it
In Spain there are no dark spots
The light extends to all the street
So it's much better and safer to walk around
Since nightlife here is pretty normal, it can be very safe to walk at night
You can be unlucky of course, but it's not a risk to do it
Edit: The police patrols at night and they tend to move around the city so you feel extra safe
Are there any areas at all in Iceland where you could feel unsafe
I think most people would be scared in Barcelona
I'm a man who lives in Santa Coloma, next to BCN, and I prefer to not walk alone at home, at any moment that's dark
I do it anyway because my girl friends are even more afraid than me
Based on what some friends told me I wouldn't even walk alone at day
I don't know, I usually feel really safe in Barcelona, you just have to avoid specific neighborhoods, but even then
The only problem in BCN is if you're drunk and fall sleep, then you'll be 100% robbed
> In addition, I have many Latin American friends that when I asked what is what they like the most from Spain is how safe it is
I live in Barcelona, where according to some [comments here] is even considered dangerous
I know a lot of Latin American people and they all appreciate how safe the Barcelona metropolitan area feels to them
Oh, well I'll keep that in mind
When I went to London I felt pretty safe, but I guess as a tourist I see things differently
Shit
That was scary, it gave me goosebumps
Recently, I met a Spanish guy who lived in Northern Ireland 25 years ago (I did too for a year)
He was only 18yo and didn't speak much English
He had a written address on a piece of paper where he was meant to go
A proper punk guy (mohawk and all), which back in the day they were unfairly labeled as dangerous, approached him as he looked lost
Grabbed the piece of paper and told him to follow him
He walked him all the way to the address and say goodbye
that was all
It's a Barcelona problem, not a nation-wide one
Where I live it's pretty safe, but I've seen someone getting robbed in Barcelona
I'll never comeback, unless that problem's solved
I've felt far more unsafe in places like Alicante, València or Murcia, than in Barcelona
It has some bad areas, as every big city does
Good thing in Cartagena is that the bad zone, Lo campano, is on the outskirts and badly connected so you can't really get there by accident
In Murcia there are a couple dangerous zones in the middle of the town
I'd like to be mugged by a glacier then
Regarding the Icelandic standards of gettho looks xD I did experience a similar thing in the Netherlands, in Eindhoven
The area where I lived was kinda nice to me but then found out by the locals that it was considered a bit of middle/working class area
From your experience, which nationalities are most present among inmigrants in that area
That's a ghetto
Daaaamn
Robbed is too general of a phrase in English, was it a pickpocketing or mugging
I'm from Murcia capital and I've been several times in Alicante and I can say I've been at late hours of the night and didn't feel unsafe at all
Can't say a thing of Valencia though
Alicante or Murcia
Valencia I cam believe, but I always felt that Barcelona is the worst when it comes to that
Arguably some neighborhoods in Madrid too, but most is fine
Someone felt asleep waiting at the metro station and a group of people started taking their things
Idk if I'd define that as pickpocketing, but no one was threatened
Ah okay
Tbf getting robbed after falling asleep at the metro station would happen in the safest of cities
Oh yeah, I mean I've been personally lucky, but I know people who had gotten their phone pickpocketed, and I've seen news about
I'm just saying I feel uncomfortable and that I don't like it, not that Barcelona is the most dangerous place on earth
Not really
As everything in spain (and europe), it is a regional thing
If you want to go by stereotypes then yeah you could say the spanish guitar but other typical instruments are the bagpipes, the txistu (a 3 hole flute that sounds like the devil), the castannettes, nunut, etc,etc
In Galicia, it's definitely the Galician bagpipe
The pandeiro (a type of tambourine) is also quite typical
For the rest of Spain, the lute and the bandurria, on top of the obvious Spanish guitar
well the spanish guitar or the clasic guitar is quite closelly asociated with spain
Imho the [bandurria] could be the one, or at least more widespread than most
What do you mean "not really"? The standard/classical guitar is literally called [Spanish guitar]
As someone from Navarre, your Txistu description is spot on
That said, I would say Spanish guitar is a good example
Albéniz, Tárrega, Rodrigo
in galicia you will see that their instrument is the Galician bagpipe
Yep, the tunos are also fun when they play that hahaha
Yeah but that guitar doesn't apear in many other traditional music styles
Like you won't see a guitar in any gallician, basque, asturian, cantabrian or for that matter castillian music
I'd say the guitar could be the national instrent because we are known for it and peoole play the guitar
But it can also be discussed
I barely tolerate txistu just because i'm from bilbao hahaha
But yeah it is terrible
How can you not like the txistu
It makes me feel nostalgic whenever I hear txistu eta danbolina played by the same person
Those unforgettable Christmas moments
More than 1000 people were killed by the [1755 Lisbon earthquake] being a town of less than 2000 inhabitants at the time
Also, some of the crew of Columbus' first voyage to America were locals, and one of them allegedly was the first European ever to smoke tobacco, for which he was jailed
The battle of Vitoria in 1813, a major battle in the napoleonic wars were France got kicked out of the Iberian peninsula
The fact that in 1873 it declared independence and got it for a brief moment, we were able to even produce our own coin the "Duro cantonal"
IIRC my region also got independence around that time and even tried to ally the United States
I wouldn't now where to start, so much shit has happened in Madrid at this point that I don't think there's a most notable event
We have the [Centro Virtual Cervantes] or CVC, but I'm not sure if they're the ones managing the property rights of Cervantes's work, considering that his works are so old that they don't have copyright anymore
Author's rights expire in 70 or 80 years here, if I remember it correctly
Didnt he sell the licence for the game adaptation, not the IP itself
And from what i heard the problem was that he didnt think the games were going to be very successful so he asked for an upfront price instead of a % of earnings and then TW3 became wildly popular
"Pie" means foot in Spanish
And I have a H&M cap that says "PURE" on it because is the spanish version of the word purée and it always makes me smile
"Dick" (English) = "Dic" (Catalan) and it means "(to) say/tell" (1st person present tense)
One of my favourites has to be "constipado", which simply means that you have a cold (so nothing to do with bowel movements or lack thereof)
In Spain we use the word "Constipado" when someone has a cold, but some people think it translates to Constipation
Rape is a kind of fish in spanish
First that comes to mind is "actual" which means "current" as in right now, a pretty confusing "false friend" for many people in school (including me)
"Actually", is wrongfully used as "currently" many, many times
And "Rape" means angler fish
Interesting
what is the infinitive
In Spanish it’s _saltar_
Just be a decent person and try to blend in, by that I mean do as you see locals do
Also, many countries in Europe, specially in less touristic areas, are monolingual, so they speak their native language and that's it
Trying to learn some basics helps a lot, for example, some weeks ago I was in Germany with my parents, who only speak Spanish, and when I tried to speak some very basic German they were impressed and more eager to help
You may not be the best speaker, but people will appreciate the effort
On top of what they've said which is pretty much simple common sense, honestly, I'd say try not to look like the typical tourist, and I'm talking specifically about the clothing (but also about being oblivious and unaware of your surroundings)
We have have a word for these in Spanish: *guiri*; look it up
Talking specifically about warmer countries or warm season
Ditch cargo pants, knee-long pants in freaking November, socks & sandals combo, safari hats, sports caps, university/sports t-shirts or hoodies, sports shoes instead of regular shoes, trekking shoes, travelling backpack (or anything resembling the backpacker look), Hawaiian shirts, swimsuit or shirtless in the town center, high socks
Just wear jeans and t-shirt/shirt like everyone else does and try to blend in
To point the obvious, if you look like this you're just begging to get pickpicketed (places with high tourist density)
Also, don't get shitfaced drunk and jump off balconies
What do you mean
If you're actually interested in the local culture and languages you'll be very welcome wherever you go
use deodorant and shower regularly
you can be the most respectful guy out there but if you smell like a trash can then you're annoying people next to you at trains, restaurants, hostels, etc
you kiss me too much
I am spanish, she is ukrainian
I think everybody can figure out who said that
My colombian gf likes hot chocolate with cheese, which i find to be *a true aberration of nature
Besides that, spanish is weird, so we might dont be able to understand each other even if we are speaking the same language lol
They sell sweet popcorn in the cinemas here and it’s delicious
*yes*
*I feel you*
Chocolate a la taza y queso fresco
Same in Catalonia (although not in other Catalan-speaking regions like Valencia AFAIK): "dos quarts de tres" (two quarters of three)
Queso sin madurar
Con chocolate  encima sería parecido a queso con miel que es de lo mejor
That we are socialist and there's no freedom of speech At least we don't lock children in cells  u know
That we have wars all the time
*Oh wait
Not really a stereotype but
Many americans online seem to think that we don't exist or just assume we're American too
To be fair, there definitely are more Americans than Europeans online and I too simply assume I'm talking to someone from the US
That Europe is all the same and you can make stereotypes about the whole region somehow
There was a 5 bed house with large basement (with wine cellar) and swimming pool for sale in our area for €425K recently
Probably could’ve got it for €380-390K
In Almería, Spain you can get [this] a pretty nice apartment
Something like this with pool and garden

I thought the op is American so he can compare with something s/he is familiar with
Avoid restaurants with menus in multiple languages, or with photos of a paella and sangria
Not authentic, and they rip you off
These are normally closer to monuments or landmarks, or along promenades in seaside towns
And if the menu is translated to English, the worse  the translation and design, the better the quality
And if the menu is translated to English, the worse  the translation and design, the better the quality
I dont know, in Spain is relatively common in any city where the menu is in spanish, regional language (basque/catalan/whatever) and english
Regarding the "empty steak" there is a certain cut from the sirloin called "vacío" (empty) in spanish
Maybe in portuguese it's the same
Same in Spanish, "diente de león".
Normalmente escribo en español y luego el traductor automático me lo traduce todo
EDIT: oh, it didn't work this time, I usually write in Spanish and the translator do the rest automatically
No, we just use English in the multicultural subs and other languages in the language-specific subs
I write in French on the r/France but English everywhere else
I write them in English directly
It's the main reason why I use Reddit, because it helps me improve my skills on informal English
That and the subs about cute pet videos haha
I just learnt English
I like to speak in english so for practice i have never chosen to translate
Except onders instead of subs, this sounds like how my siblings talk, as they spoke way less Dutch as children than me so they use English grammar with Dutch words
In your country, what's considered the first floor of a building
The one at street level or the next one
In Spain, the floor at street level is floor 0 (or *bajo*, literally "low" or "short"), and the next one is the first floor
What about your country
Barcelona has a lot of buildings where you have ground floor, then above it you have the principal or main floor and then the first floor
And in some cases it can be even more confusing with a "entresuelo" before the principal, so the second floor is actually the fourth
So delivery agencies usually ask for big packages "is the address a real n-th floor
". People looking for renting usually ask the same question, specially if the building has no elevator
Interesting
We also have the word *parterre* (from French, too) in Spanish, but it means garden or something like that
I have never been in a building like that, but honestly it doesn't surprise me
We're such a mess at everything
Principal is 1st floor
Entresuelo is mezzanine
Maybe those first floors where open to each other
One of the most revolutionary inventions of the 20^th century
The mop
The mop, the lolipop, the submarine and the astronaut suit
Marine corps
We are basically the best at inventing things by puting a stick to something that already exists
Don't know if it counts, but in Spain a lot of rivers/places start with Guada, which comes from Arabic and means "living water" or "current"
Some examples include:
Guadalajara
Guadalquivir
Guadarrama
Guadiana
Guadalete
Guadalaviar
Guadalupe
Etc
There are many places with names tht have a bland entomological origin but nowadays they don't sound that wya because those words aren't used anymore
For example, "extremadura" used to be a land in the "extreme" of a kingdom, so kinda like "borderland", but nowadays "Extremadura" is an specific region
Similarly, there are many towns called "Medina", which is city or town in Arab
Nobody uses "medina" or "extremadura" in their original general meaning anymore
There are also many towns and villages that have very straightforward names
Many are called things like Villa(something) of (river/region)
"Plaza de España"; technically all of them are
No, Guada comes from "wad", meaning current
"Wād al-ḥaŷara" (Guadalajara) means stone river, for example
Edit: So after briefly double checking, I think that wadi/wad actually means both river and valley (?) I'm not sure though
I see, that's probably it
I think using "wad" as the main word for river instead of "nahur" was a feature on Andalusi Arabic dialect
The Arabic dialect in Al-Andalus was close to Maghrebi Arabic but it developed his own features too
Most of the names I gave refer to rivers, it is also something I've always been told
When searching the origin for the prefix "Guada", most Spanish sites tend to agree that it comes from river/current/water in Arabic
A directive, every country will adapt it differently and internet will just ignore countries law since, let's be frank, most webpages only care to follow US laws
I let out a small little *fuck
* and then I continue with my life
It also comes down to how each member enforces the article and adapts itw own legislation to it just like any other EU directive
On the other hand, it's understandable and desirable that countries have the ability to adapt a generic directive to their own specific conditions
Meat+mushrooms+Margherita base is quite standard in most mainstream pizzerias
Dipping crust, I hope
Donerkebab pizza
Doner just means spinning, and refers to food cooked on a spinning stick
I'm drooling right now
Oversalted fries really benefit from some sugar/vinegar mix like ketchup
It's usually too fatty
A good way to end up with a stomach reminding you all night of it, if you are past your teens
Pros: Weather, food, nightlife, maaaaany things to do
Cons: Awful wages compared to other countries, politics has been a shitshow since forever, streets aren't as clean as I would like
Concebollismo o muerte
Agreed
Bonus if you live on a main Street in Barcelona or a tourist-only town
I have never found [this] kind of blinds for windows in Northern Europe
Why
You have a very changing light duration along the year, it's ideal for you
I just can't get it, first days up there to sleep always is an issue for me
Same point by point
Pros: beer paradise
The country responsible for Chimay, Rochefort, Triple Karmeliet and Westvleteren deserves a spot in my heart
Food is really good
Iberian brothers
Bilbao is one of a kind, the best city in Spain in my opinion
Yeah when I see these people I'd like to throw their faces on the street too
Dog shit however has gotten WAY better over the years
In my experience virtually all dog owners clean after their dogs
Onion should be on onion
Not really, just a lot of people that vote for the public benefits
Maybe you are right
Actually I am not sure if the differences with Italy are so big but compared to other countries like Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands etc I don't see Spain significantly more progressive than them
We even have a right wing party (Vox) on the rise that wants harden border controls and deport all illegal inmigrants
Younger people tend to be more progressive but since all this came in such a short time (compared to other countries) these views get really different when you talk to older people, or even get borderline fascist
Right wing parties new and old are feeding on this situation (and on pure hate campaigns) so the situation is actually worse every year
A few years back you wouldn't think people would be gloryfying the Spanish Empire, and nowadays you can find weirdos with the cross of burgundy military flag on their backpacks
I can't think of a name for it, but I think it was a common thing to "go to London" to have an abortion a few decades ago
Celestina or Curandera, I'd say
Celestina
Like "La Celestina"?
Oh wait lol, that's not what I wanted to say
I meant to say "Casamentera", as it is said that they would also practice abortions, apart from getting people married, but yeah, I'd say curandera is more accurate
This soviet song: [Полюшко-поле (Polyushka Polye / Oh fields my fields)] goosebumps
The Red Army Choir performance is the best and the most known, but any performance, [even this weird version from Helene Fischer] with some verses in english, is still amazing
Another one is the Portuguese popular song [Grândola Vila Morena] , related to the carnation Revolution (it was, in fact, broadcasted on radio \[it was banned by the  dictatorship\] as a signal to begin it)
Erika is an absolute banger ngl, Bella ciao too since la casa de papel, katyoshka too, the basis for the blue division song primavera
Didnt they end it because it wasnt as profitable anymore
1) [**The Palomares nuclear accident**] was a nuclear accident that occurred in the Spanish town of Palomares, belonging to the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora (Almería), on 17 January 1966
In the historical context of the Cold War, two United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft, a tanker plane and a B-52 strategic bomber collided in flight during a refuelling manoeuvre
This resulted in the detachment and fall of the four thermonuclear bombs carried by the B-52, as well as the death of seven of the eleven crew members of both aircraft
2) [**The Prestige oil spill**] occurred off the coast of Galicia, Spain, caused by the sinking of the 26 year old structurally deficient oil tanker MV Prestige in November 2002
The spill polluted thousands of kilometers of coastline and more than one thousand beaches on the Spanish, French and Portuguese coast, as well as causing great harm to the local fishing industry
The spill is the largest environmental disaster in the history of both Spain and Portugal
The amount of oil spilled was more than the Exxon Valdez incident and the toxicity considered higher, because of the higher water temperatures
3) [**The 2011 Lorca earthquake**] (Spanish: Terremoto de Lorca de 2011) was a moderate 5
1 Mw earthquake that occurred on 11 May 2011 causing significant localized damage in the Region of Murcia, Spain, and panic among locals, and displacing many from their homes
The [1962 Riadas del Vallés] (wikipedia in Spanish) are one of the most famous floodings in the history of Spain, between 600-1000 people died
It rained a lot and very suddenly after a period of drought, and since a lot of towns had built small houses made with cheap materials right next to the rivers everything was destroyed when the rivers overflowed
It affected a lot of buildings in Spain like churches and abyss
It was a huge fact in the History for us Spanish people too
Not one of the most famous, but one I remember reading about after my parents mentioned it when we walked past the place where it happened is [Los Alfaques disaster] in which 217 people died and 200+ were injured after a tanker truck exploded near a campsite
Warning: Google shows some disturbing NSFW pictures
Yeah
I always wondered why the stain glass of Plasencia's cathedral was so crappy
Turns out that the old one was destroyed during the earthquake
And the church of Granada
Really far from Lisbon
That's really far
Sangría and churros
I personally like both a lot but I don't think it's that common in a Spanish table
- Sangría is sometimes drank in the summer, but I'd say most people prefer to have an ice cold beer
- Churros or porras would be like a special sunday breakfast, but I don't think it's what a Spaniard would usually have for breakfast, specially the ones that have breakfast at home
They are both fairly popular, there's always people at churrerías, and people will indeed order sangria in a restaurant
But they are probably not your day to day option
Definitely "paella". In some regions is very usal but in the rest of the country it's something you once a year practically
in Madrid: Callos a la Madrileña. It's supposed to be our regional dish¹ but almost no one eats it regularly nowadays
Here you have a pic
It's basically a tripe stew
Many people are put off by the texture
Tbh I can't say I'm a fan
As for Spain
Foreigners go too hardcore on tapas restaurants and paella
We don't eat them that often². Same with sangria and churros
Sangria is pretty unpopular overall
Churros IS regarded as a treat
Paella and tapas (whole dinner) are regional
Elsewhere in the country you might eat them once or twice a year
But tell me some dishes you associate with us and I'll tell you how often we eat them
¹contested with cocido
²depending on the region
Yeah, what lots of people drink during summer is tinto de verano, which is red wine mixed with either lemon soda or sparkling water
I would say churros are more common than sangría. I've literally never witnessed anybody ordering sangría, it's always tinto de verano or beer
However churros is something you do occasionally as a fun Sunday plan or whatever
Like going for brunch
Completely agree, I acknowledge sangria as a typical Spanish drink, but I can count with my fingers the amount of times I've had it
Love it though
Tinto de verano is a cheaper version of sangria that is what people order here in summer
I totally agree about sangría. It's the kind of thing a teenager would drink briefly when they are just starting to drink alcohol
I don't remember ever going out with friends and someone ordering sangría, it's just not what we drink at all
I much prefer tinto de verano with Casera
I disagree somewhat about churros
At least in Madrid, it is the tradition to eat them for breakfast on the 1st of January (hangover cure), and people do eat them every now and then (not necessarily for breakfast), mostly in the winter
Spain and Italy united against spaghetti with meatballs and paella with chorizo
&#x200B;
because in other parts of spain we dont eat paella, we eat things with rice :)
If we count tapas, its very easy to eat paella weekly (as long as there is no global pandemic)
And eating "yellow rice with stuff" and calling it paella for short, is very common, I would say weekly/monthly in most parts of the country
IMO churros are only appropriate to have with your friends at 8 AM after partying all night
No way, Los Serrano
Please tell me you lived in Spain or something
If Los Serrano aired in Finnish TV I don't know what's real anymore
Just to clarify, it's Casera, not sparkling water (slightly different things)
Casera is the best
I like sangría and have drunk it often enough, but yeah, it's not that widespread
Beer is king
I prefer sangría mainly for its fruity flavor, but in that category tinto is better because it tastes less like alcohol
Sangría is better if you want more alcohol for your buck, of course
Churros are too heavy to eat as a dessert, considering that you have already eaten
They are usually eaten on their own at breakfast with a drink, most commonly dipped in hot chocolate
In my region they're also usually eaten in the middle of the afternoon in summer (19:00 or 20:00 pm), because there is a long time between lunch (14:00 or 15:00 pm) and dinner (22:00 pm or even later)
They are sold in paper cartridges, sprinkled with sugar, and you eat them as you walk along the promenade watching the sunset
Andalusian around here, in my family its tradition to have onion soup every year at Easter, and sometimes also at Christmas
Maybe it's something more southern or maybe not, because I don't know many people who have this tradition (mainly because they don't like that soup), but in my university canteens they used to put onion soup on the menu from time to time and also in the menu bar where I used to go to eat in my previous job
¯\_O_/¯
I'm from Valencia and I eat it in every family gathering
Ahora vivo en Inglaterra y no te vas a creer las veces que he visto mierda mezclada con arroz llamada 'paella' en las tiendas
I would say that the most common paella here is "mixta": rice, vegetables and chicken, rabbit, prawns and mussels
Then there is the traditional Valencian paella, which is prepared without seafood
Sometimes I've seen fish paella (monkfish instead of chicken and rabbit), but it's not very common
Great investment of tax-payer's money tbh
Gracias, buen yankee, por ayudarnos con la guerra contra el diablo
Hahaha, era todo un puto sueño de Resines
If you're ear rings (tinnitus
), someone is gossiping about you
If a black cat crosses the street in front of you, it's bad luck
If you don't want something bad that you just said happening, touch wood (any kind of wood)
If you're a bad kid, the Three Mage Kings (from the bible) will only bring you coal as a present on the 6th of January
If one of your teeth falls as a kid, the ratoncito Pérez (little mouse Pérez) will trade it for money
Don't open an umbrella inside the house
If you put your handbag on the floor, your money will go away (your finances will be bad)
Edit: I forgot my favourite one
If someone is sweeping the floor and they accidentally sweep over your feet with the broom, you won't get married
Oh, and if a bird shits on you, it's good luck ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
*Wearing some red garment on new year's eve brings good luck
(Specially underwear)
*If you rob a thief you have 100 years of good luck
*If you break a mirror the following 7 year will bring you bad luck
We have a bunch, some I know:
For bad luck:
* Walking under a ladder
* Breaking a mirror
* Making a toast with water
* Spilling salt
* Getting out of the bed with the left foot
* Being gift with a knife (when somebody gifts you a knife you are supposed to pay at least some cents so it's not a gift)
* Being looked at by a one eyed person
* Pointing at a pumpkin of supposed to kill that pumpkin
For good luck:
* Stepping on shit
* Rubbing a lottery ticket on a pregnant belly or on a humpback's hump
* Wearing red underwear for new year's eve
* Put something made of gold in your glass for new year's eve toast
* On st John's day night (June 23rd) we celebrate it traditionally in the beach, and you have to jump 3 waves
Also in Spain the day of bad luck is Tuesday 13th instead of friday 13th
Oranges in the morning are gold, in the afternoon they're silver and at night they kill you
&#x200B;
We say the same about olives
oof we got that one too
also i've heard that many old people here believe that if you're making funny faces and the wind changes, you'll be stuck with that face forever
&#x200B;
honestly wtf
I doubt there is a thief robbing spanish guide but perhaps we should first define what does good luck mean
I would say that the severity of the good luck you are given is proportional to how much did you steal and how much did the thief you roobed theft before
I know it's confusing, no one said being spanish was easy
We could also agree that if you rob a thief you are allowed to break an aprox of 14,3 mirrors
Always:
Literature - green
Maths - red
Geography/history - blue
Science - yellow
And the rest depends on the subjects and the years
Red for maths
Blue for Spanish
Green for sciences
Not folders, but notebooks:
Math - Yellow; Sciences/history - Green; Spanish - Red; Galician - blue; Second language - purple
Those are the basics for me
ooohh i got it, we used to do this in primary school but with notebooks
Now most of us use one folder for everything, but this is how we did it in our class:
math - red
spanish - yellow
biology/nature shit - green (obv)
english - dark blue
valencian (the language) - light blue
history/social shit - orange
&#x200B;
edit: and then a small nasty yellow one for religion, because no one cares about it
Red: mathematics
Orange: physical
Yellow: technology
Green: science
Blue: language
Purple: music
Pink: art
Brown: history, geography, social studies
- Math - blue
- Literature - red + orange (2 languages)
- English - yellow
- Physics - Purple
- Chemistry - Green
- "Technical drawing" - grey
- History - dark red/brown
- Computer science - plastic sheaths
- industrial tech - plastic sheaths
Edit: back in "bachillerato", and not folders but notebooks
Last time someone brought this on twitter we almost start another civil war
I think I'm gonna pass this one
I had 6 different colours twice so I used yellow for catalan/history, orange for spanish/philosophy, red for maths/technology, green for science/religion, light blue for english/P.E., dark blue for german/random stuff
It would've been a good idea to add a picture of what you meant haha
If it's [this] you're talking about, then I only recall using purple folders for music and art ([like this one] I don't know if it was because those were the ones they sold at the paper store we'd go to purchase most of my school material or because I used very few folders and those were sold individually
For anything else I'd buy packets of paper or one of those notebooks with holes and store them on my file folder thing, the one with the dangerous rings that could snap a finger in two
I don't remember which color I assigned to each subject on those separators
At one point I stopped using individual folders and I started using one of these:  [
Mine didn't have color tags
I never color-coded anything, it was random every year
Only people with OCD would do that
The main downside of living in Spain is alredy widely known: lack of jobs, which also makes wages lower due to this supply-demand thingy
Honestly I am quite surprised Germans and Brits complained about wages here
You may not be Norway but at least you aren't Southern Europe :(
Rooki numbers
18:02 here
It's nice enough but the sun has just started to get up so there's the downside
I was paid almost the double of what I could get in Spain for a not-really-that-qualified IT job in Slovakia
Two-thousand upwards salaries are hard to come by even in positions which require uni degrees (engineering
), because they have gotten us used to it with the recent crisis
Why bother paying a good salary when you got hundreds of fresh graduates willing to take the position at any cost
It’s already very depressing to see no sun at 18, I can’t imagine living up north
Honestly I would enjoy the sun raising 30-45 earlier
When I drive to school it looks like 2:00
I'd say a provincial capital like Granada
Even tho some autonomic capitals like Seville, Bilbao or Valencia are liked by the rest of the country, it seems like anybody else in their autonomous region hates them
Granada is a great smaller city, with a big student life, close to mountains and the sea, the mother fucking Alhambra, the Albaicin, etc
For Spain I would say Andalucía, the southest part of Europe
It is the region with the best weather, one of the best gastronomy (if not the best), nice people, cheaper than almost any other region in the country, and you can find whatever sort of entertainment you are looking for: there is fantastic beaches, historical tourism, hipster and trendy cities, snowy mountains, deserts regions, a lot of nature reserves
The foreign tourists choose Andalucía as the best part of the country as well
Maybe TOLEDO for Spain
Or Cordoba
Definitely none of the bigger regional capitals as everyone claims to be the best
I loved Ghent as well when I was there a couple of years ago
In fact I'm considering doing my Erasmus next year in a school that the University of Leuven has there
What's the reason
I don´t think it´s necessary hate, it´s just that Berlin and Munich are sooooo different that it´s normal for ones to just dislike the atmosphere of the other city
And politics also don´t help with that as there´s always the CDU-CSU rope pull
But being born in Munich it´s not like people hate Berlin, just most of the ones who go don´t like the vibes
Yep
I was about to say Granada
And maybe Asturias, Gijón has a very good reputation too (even though I can remember they hate Oviedo
Ill go for the Canary Islands
I've never heard anyone say anything bad about Valencia, the city
But everyone says Valencianos are cold and more stand-offish
While this hasn't been my personal experience with Valencianos, every time I bring up the fact that I want to move there, the first thing everyone says is "oh but what about the people there
Madrileños are so much nicer
" I wonder if that might just be classic Madrileño superiority though
That kinda makes me like it more lol
They do, i went to college in Gijón while my sister went to Oviedo and both cities had some hate that you could see on posters, grafittis and my sister even found a "puta Gijón" written in one of the tables in the university
From what i see in Gijón the hate comes from the fact that people  from Oviedo are posh, classist and consider themselves better than the rest of Asturias just because they are the capital and have "more culture" than the rest of us
Gotta say i kinda agree with Gijón on this one but since i've been living here a few years i might not be impartial
Yeah, but Bilbao is the city tht suffers the "capital hatred" syndrome, kinda like NYC in New York instead of Albany
Revilla isn't precisely impartial, is he
And with Asturias right next to Cantabria
Quien no conoce a Dios, a cualquier santo le reza
A lot of people in the Valencian Autonomous Community (Alicante, Castellón, etc) have some hate for Valencia often
And in addition to that
I've seen in other regions of Spain negative impressions about Valencia because corruption, "maletines", Rita or unsustainable tourism
Architecture
My school has made me used to loads of work and all-nighters so I won't worry about that lol
Yeah, this year filomena (a snow storm) completely collapsed the northern half of Spain
Madrid was hit specially hard, just because snow in Madrid is pretty rare
They got about half a meter of snow and everything collapsed
No garbage removal, roads closed, trees fallen,... They had to move my exams two weeks up ahead
I went a week later and my college was In shambles
My departments drawing room ceiling had collapsed under the snow
In my town, which regularly gets snow, everything was fine by day 2
I know I should do it in English, but most of the time I don't. I'm studying, so my teachers:
a) wouldn't understand it
b) would think I just copied the code from the internet
I guess once I'm a professional I'll do it in English all of the time
I do always write in English my code, README, comments
I also search errors and tutorials in English
Mostly spanish/catalan (in university)
English if it is meant to be professional code or public project, both for names and comments/documentation, otherwise it can be seen as unprofessional and can pose a challenge to proper understanding within international teams
However, I often try to duplicate documentation at least in Spanish (not only because it is my first language, it is also the second language in the world by native speakers so I guess it makes sense)
When the code and comments are for some small personal project or dumb tinkering then I end up mixing whatever goes through my head
I use both English and Spanish when I'm writing for myself, and for the most part switch to English only if I'm sharing the code
It helps that in my job 90% of my scripts are only going to be used by me lol
Is it easy learning Russian knowing Serbian
Thanks for the answer
By the way, I just realized how little I know about Eastern Europe history
What is their anti-union stance there
Do they fire people if they are found to be members of an union or something like that
Genuinely asking because doing these things in Spain at the very least is a guarantee of a permanent strike or even going to the judges (if the workers care that is)
In Spain about 50 years ago there was a lot of difference between sexes
There were single sex schools untill college
But nowadays almost all of schools are mixed schools and there is a lot of social context to go wit friends, from either sex, like going for a drink or coffee
So yes, absolutely
It's pretty normal, especially as you grow up
I'm in high school and I was surprised to see how while Spanish girls and boys socialize together and it's no big deal, our German exchange students would feel uncomfortable when doing anything with someone of the opposite sex
Of course, but its mostly that one wierd guy who everyone thinks is gay
Of course
If it's an unknown number:
¿Diga
Imperative of "to say", second person formal
Or ¿Si
(Yes
If it's a known person I talk like in a normal conversation face to face
Old people will awnser with their family name but young people will awnser just with a hellow or tell me
You'd say "¿sí?", which means "yes
", or "¿dígame
" more formally, meaning "tell me
The only correct way is "dígamelón", a combination of "tell me" and "melon"
How old you have to be to answer like that
+100 yo
My grandparents never answer like that
Im just 17 almost 18 lol
Technically in 1492, but it had been formed since the start of the Reconquista
More or less 528 years
That was a really productive year tho
Well, the name and the concept of Spain (Hispania) came from the romans, but officialy Spain was founded in 1479
10 years before, in 1469 Isabel de Castilla got married with Fernando de Aragon and in 1479, when they actually became in Queen of Castilla and King of Aragon, the unified the two kingdoms
In 1492 they completed the unification conquering Granada, the last area with muslims
The same year, the kings approved the trip of Cristobal Colon, who ended up finding America
That was a great century for us
It's complicated
The first time the government of Castilla and Aragon was unified was in 1479, when Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla married, unifying both crowns
But at this time it wasn't **a** country, each part had its own institutions and its own ruler
The first time there was a *king* of Castilla and Aragon was in 1516, Carlos I (Charles V in Germany), but again, the institutions were separated
Spain as a single government started in 1707, with the Nueva Planta decrees, imposed by Felipe V.
It's tough to say, because many argue Castille or even Asturias can also be considered a proto-Spain, so the answer would be years 1065 and 718 respectively
But that's just politically
I'd say the basis of Spanish identity goes as far back as the Romans, culturally, religiously and, mostly liguistically (obviously), so we could say it all started with the end of the Second Punic War in 201 BCE
I don't really see how could you consider Castile or Asturias to be "proto-Spain", that would be like Prussia or Brandenburg being "proto-Germany".
Drywalls in homes
I think that's not legal here, you can make a hole just punching it, it's definitely not safe
For everything else, you always use your car or always there is someone with a van or a smal truck (something this size
When you buy bulky items, the store will deliver it to your home and even install it
If I buy in Ikea I always check the size to be sure it will fit in my car, I haven't had any problems yet, if someday I need something bigger I'd rent a van or hire someone with a van
If it fits in my car, then the car
Otherwise delivery as it's usually cheap, or a friend's van
And if none of those work (his van isn't that large), we rent a large van
That's what she said
They are expensive cars that need a lot of gas (which is very expensive in comparison to USA, about 1
5 USD per litre, more than 6 per gallon)
So if you have money for that you end buying a BMW, Audi or any other highend sedan/SUV
weak walls, you'll see drywals used for offices and simmilar instalations, but not for homes
yeah, it's known as pladur (it's a name brand used for the stuff even if it's not for the branded one) here
It's used for workplaces, offices, that kind of stuff
Nobody wants a wall you can remove with a punch in their home here
I'm saying they are very easy to be broken
Here you won't find houses like that (I mean is very very uncommon, maybe someone liked and did it, or maybe a centuries old home restored) Here houses are made with bricks and cement, if it has beams like [this] they are probably decorative, not functional or part of the structure
I bought a home last year and before painting I embedded a big gutter in the wall with one big junction box in each extreme
Then I painted over it
I did this where the TV was supposed to go mostly for future use and you cannot see it unless you move the TV or the furniture underneath and remove the cover of the junction box
My forearm fits inside
So it's very convenient to run any kind of cable with any kind of connector within the wall
As someone who spent some time in NZ I was astonished by how British the country felt to me
I hope you at one point attempted the earth sandwich down there (NZ and Spain are exact antipodes)
I spent some time in Australia and I really wanted to go to NZ solely to drink a beer on the exact side of the planet from Madrid - Weber, NZ (a bit east of Palmerston North) for anyone interested
For the record
I never made it to NZ
Edit: along the lines of your original comment, I was surprised how NOT British Australia felt
I was expecting it to "feel" a bit more British but I felt more like I was in the USA - that goes for Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in my opinion
Yeah I think it really does come down to infrastructure - more suburbial type layouts where people live outside the city centers and you have to drive everywhere on freeways
Everything is much more spread out (and newer) than in the UK, which gives it a more American like feel
That would be unimaginable here, so we never learnt to cook in school
Never had it in Spain
My mother has taught me at home
And she did recently, when I was in my late teens
Why would they teach me earlier anyways
We don't have cooking classes at school and I honestly don't think it's necessary
It's the kind of things your parents should teach you
Same here
My school didn't have kitchen or canteen
To the point that I have some female friends that are *proud* of the fact that they can’t cook
Who cares that it’s a vital life skill
It’s not like you are going to move out of your parents’ house anytime soon, amiright
(people are weird sometimes)
To me what's weird is having cooking classes at school lol
Yeah but in Spain very few kids have lunch at school because classes end before lunch at 14-14:30
Only those whose parents get out of work later eat at school so in smaller ones there's no canteen
I mean, that does explain learning things like that earlier, but it doesn't explain why it's taught at school
I mean we can't complain, getting the citizenship her in Spain is hard as balls
But in my humble (and uninfomed) opinion people should pass a basic level exam on the country's main language and some culture
That's like the bare minimum
I'd like to hear some arguments against this
I think they should be able to speak fluently the language (It doesn’t matter the accent) and to have a basic knowledge about the country history
So, I’m totally against it
You should not be granted the citizenship if you don’t talk the main language across the country
Completely against, if you want to become Spanish, you must speak Spanish fluently, it's just logical, our national language is Spanish, so at least learn the national one, learn it
I think at least a decent level of proficiency should be required as part of the citizenship process
Although I would say it could vary quite a lot depending on the country and citizenship requirements
Here in Spain if you have no other connection to Spain (e.g. Spanish partner / relative) then you have to live here for 10 years to apply for citizenship
Given that amount of time before you can even apply for nationality, I think it's reasonable to expect a pretty good level of Spanish
The requirement however is a B1 level if I remember right which personally seems a little bit low
If the requirement were only 5 years of residency then I think it'd be perfectly fine, learning a language takes a long time and once you know a certain level it's more up to you how much you want to integrate yourself into the culture and how much effort you want to put in
Without the language pretty difficult to do anything here
im pretty sure that Spain requires applicants to take a Spanish history/culture exam at the Cervantes institute in Spanish when you apply for citizenship by descent
Italy has ahd a lot of diasporas and they think that giving the citizenship is good for they country (even wuth greatgranparents)
Here in spain you only get the nationality if you are son of a spaniard and for most vountries it requires 10 years of legal residency in spain
This
You are totally right
Well, i get it if they are retired people
It's good manners to learn the language but if we are being honest they are offered all the sevices in english so why bother
Yes, but it's as easy as the driving test
30 test type questions or so
One of the most plausible scenarios is requiring British immigrants to get a signed contract or ask for a special permission that demonstrates they are legally allowed to stay in the country for a certain period of time ( i guess that they can also elongate their stay by renovating their permits)
If they don't they'll probably get kicked out of the country immediately and they would need to apply directly from the UK, which means they are going to lose some solid ten years of their lives just to see a single sad spanish sunray again (i'm pretty sure the Spanish government will put a lot of burocratic obstacles to permissions sent directly from Britain)
I'm sure Spain will allow them to stay
they are old people passing their last years in Spain
They love spending their money here and we love it too
It's just free money
Mexico and Spain are different countries
If you would learnt about history you would know that, so you shouldn’t be granted the citizenship
In the cities most people speak Spanish, this regional languages are more a rural thing
Well some people refuse to speak spanish because of the nationalist feelings
When I was a child I went into a store in Salou (Catalonia) and the clerk refused to speak to me in spanish
but I think they might only do it with other spanish people
(Not everyone does this, only the assholes, and if you are a foreigner I think theyll speak with you in spanish, or english if they can) Never been to Euskadi so I dont know
Happens very rarely
The spanish diaspora is almost non-existant and the vast majority of them are from southamerica, so the language is not a problem
I like other accents, makes the whole thing richer
But in Reddit is really easy to find people who say that meaning it haha so without /s I cannot tell if it’s a joke or not :(
I think it doesn’t matter your accent, the important part is communication
Some accents are more slang than accent so in those cases I would be somehow strict but as long as is just a different accent and some changes in use of words (as it happens in Mexican Spanish and Castillian Spanish) I think there’s no problem
He didn't say anything about Cataluña... and I'm sure that in Palma the majority speaks Spanish
What point
Nationality by bloodline
It's pretty standard
Idk, totally subjective i guess
It depends on what are you looking for
In Europe from one country to another there’s almost always a change in language and some differences on culture
Everything is compatible but you should aim for what you like or prioritise as it might be easier in some European countries
As your wife holds Irish citizenship you should be able to live or work in any EU state
That's not a debate cause it's just stupid
Welcome to the two EUs
Wtf
Here you buy your supplies and everything is 100% yours
If teachers want to use your work for anything they must have a signed  authorization first
Never heard of this before
Definitely not a thing in Spain
In all of Spain it may vary but in my town it's to say hello to them, you may talk or one who may want to help you on something but to be honest, I don't say anything to them and I keep a distance
Smile and say hello as we pass eachother in the elivator
That's it
I feel like in my community it varies
In my old building there were only retired and elderly people, they were very old fashioned and would all go out together and stuff, I loved it and even interviewed many of them for pleasure, they were incredibly nice people
In my new building we are mostly young adults or adults and we have a casual chat when we see each other, I even helped a neighbor produce sounds for an independent film he made :) but it's not as "old timey polite" as it was in my old building
Don't you need to reorganize the furniture of your house every night
I think this is a city vs town kind of situation
In the city you usually don't go further than saying hi in the elevator
11Km, 45 minutes by bike
It’s like a town full of just companies, Tech Park we call it
Madrid, Spain here
10 minute walk to the subway
15 minutes to my stop (thank god I don't have to switch trans)
5 minute walk to my destination
All in all, around 30 minutes
I could probably go on foot and it would take me around 40 minutes, but crossing through the centre at rush hour is not the most pleasant thing in the world
I have a remote job, so about 10 seconds from bed to the computer
40 min
bus + 5 min
walk /
~30 min
by car, depending on the traffic
I wake up, walk out of my bedroom into the kitchen/ living room area to make some coffee
Sometimes I even put pants on, but not always
Then I open the door to my home office and get to it
As cool as it sounds, working from home has gotten me down a bit lately though
It's hard to motivate myself, and it's hard without the human interaction every day, so I'm beginning to look for a small office somewhere in the city center
It's nice to have the option to work from home, but it's a bit isolating if it's your only option
I shared an office with 3 other freelancers for a few years, but this year I have been dealing with a long distance relationship and spending a lot of time in another country, so I've avoided paying rent on an office, but having just returned from almost 3 months abroad, I really need to start getting out there more
It's 45 minutes between walking, bus and metro
But I spend most of the time sitting so I guess it could be worse
It's very sunny here so it's quite lovely to walk around now that the butterflies and bees are starting to appear
Madrid, 45 minutes combining walk+bus in the morning and walk+metro in the afternoon
Mountainous part of Northern Spain
25 km and 250 m total elevation gain one way
I can go by car in 20 mins or by bike in 50-55 mins
I almost always go by bike
It's from the kitchen, with a cup of coffee, across the living room, and into my home office
25min walking, pretty pleasant, a bit more crowded in the evening and the summer
This is in Barcelona
I think we work at the same place
I am so jealous rn
This sounds exhausting
You have my respect
I wouldn't show up for work
Are you being sarcastic or genuinely asking
No, Parque tecnologico de Álava
it's cool I just ran down to the shop and got more capsules
We got almond milk and regular milk in the fridge
What are you thinking for lunch
It was a joke
Your commuting just sounds exhausting
I think it's pretty natural not knowning what it even means
I was surprised English had a word for something so particular when I learned it
I'd like to add that I think the fact that the English-speaking culture developed the need for a word for such a specific concept is pretty sad
It shows how ingrained wasting your life away in the forth/back home/work journey is in their culture (and expandingly into ours and others) and how normal it is viewed
You seem like my kinda office mate
There's no word for it
You'd have to describe it
I find the polish/slovenian Maja really beautiful name, and the pronunciation, plus, as an spaniard, written in spanish it means "very outgoing" Or "nice person" Hahaha
Also polish Piotr somehow sounds much stronger and i really like it much more than peter or pedro
>Karl, Friedrich
I really like these too
Especially in that particular order somehow
Same
I already said it in another thread, Irish female names in general are incredibly beautiful and I wish I could name my hypothetical daughter with one of them
I love lithuanian natural nameslike that
Audra means storm and it's a common name there, it's so awesome :D
I advise you against searching Simon's equivalent
Good to know, sorry
Late 20s, our youth unemployment is ridiculous, rents are high and employments for young people pay shit
Having a university degree doesn't mean that a job with a decent living salary will appear
Living on your own and young is like a dream
I'm always so blown away for how in other European countries some move so early even in their teen years
The average age is 29 years old in Spain, 26 years old in Europe (Eurostat)
I think it's because we're more family-focused as a society and because of the average income compared to the average price of renting a house
Other countries:
**Norway:** 19,3 years old
**Denmark:** 21 years old
**Sweden:** 21 years old
**Finland:** 21,9 years old
**Belgium:** 23,4 years old
**Netherlands:** 23,6 years old
**Germany:** 23,7 years old
**France:** 24 years old
**UK:** 24,4 years old
**Austria:** 25,2 years old
**Ireland
** 26,3 years old
**Hungary:** 27,4 years old
**Portugal:** 29,2 years old
**Spain:** 29,3 years old
**Greece:** 29,4 years old
**Italy:** 30 years old
**Croatia:** 31,9 years old
**Montenegro:** 32,5 years old
Some years ago the average age of young people moving somewhere else in Spain was about 30-32
Don't know if it has changed since then
It is\* better than in 2012, but 14% is still quite high
Not to mention the 35% youth unemployment and low wages
Which is kinda 'funny', because the last elections' debate wasn't about unemployment, but social issues
I only see a correlation between how far north the country is and how long kids/young adults stay at home
Exactly
The byzantine emperor sold his title to the Spanish crown before the turks defeated him
Technically our King is also emperor of the Romans
Back in the day, there was a plan for the Spanish Empire to invade and take over China
[Spanish army's rifle until 1999] was made by a former enginneer from Nazi Germany
The rifle itself started development by Mauser in 1945 until Germany lost the war
Many of the engineers escaped to Francoist Spain, and were crucial to the further development of the prototype
Spain also used many clones & licensed versions of WW2 german aircraft, such as the ["Buchon"] (Bf 109 with a bigger local engine) or spanish-made [Junkers 52] not very different from the same Ju 52 that made Franco able to move his troops from north africa to Spain in 1936 and win the Spanish Civil War
These WW2 designs were used long after becoming obsolete, in some cases due to external factors like USA telling Spain not to use american armament in the [Sidi Ifni war] therefore making all of the Spannish aircraft be WW2-era
Even 30's tanks like [T-26] captured durinng the civil war, were used until the 50's by Spain, since it was the best thing around
I already knew this story
It's still my favorite in this post (which is fascinating BTW)
I once read that the main export of some German principalities was royal spouses
What a power move
I think the titles apply to any person holding the crown not to the person itself
Because our King could not have all those titles as we changed kings a few times
The title passed in the iberian wedding
And I believe it was the king of Aragon mostly because Aragon had a strong Mediterranean presence
It's a nonsense metric anyway
I heard it long time ago but I can't remember where
My guess is that it must had been in a short stories book, classic history or literature classes or something in that vein, but I can't recall for sure
Of course
I can tell you that the title of "King of Jerusalem is a lie". However the byzantine title is true
In The Vampire Diaries (the backdoor episode) or already in The Originals
One of the characters was using Google translate to get some witch spell translated and there was a image of her choosing one language at the end and it was Galician
We had a good laugh about it because it was with suspenfull music and it ended in a "clifhanger" without knowing if it was or not Galician
I once watched a news story in my local paper about the Nintendo Spanish translator that lives in Japan and is from my home town of Granada
I’ve recognized some expressions and he uses Andalusian when characters speak with an accent in the original Japanese
It’s quite funny
Aren't there a lot of Australians of Irish ancestry
At least some must've kept the motherland's language
He uses it to translate country-style speech in RPGs
I think it’s lovely
Yeah but a few people might be able to speak it
Or at least a couple of words
An outrage for doing wrong a regional accent
Is there an outrage every time a British historical drama has English actors playing foreign characters speaking with terrible fake accents both in English and in other languages
I can't believe I have to say this (again) but
jobs
Specially unqualified ones
People don't seem to comprehend what a high unemployment rate means
And in the Spanish subs we're tired of talking down all those youngsters who believe they can come here and live off odd jobs and out of the system for a few months while traveling
No, dude, that doesn't work that way any more, if ever
Informal work is scarce, pays peanuts, and it's primed for abuse specially if you want to skip bureaucracy and be paid under the table
Not to mention that rents are high, employers and landlords want commitments, you'll have a ton of  competitors, and, most importantly, you need to speak Spanish
Weed
So much posts asking about to get weed in r/Madrid and r/Spain
Also, love for bullfighting
It's in decline and only live with subsidies due to extremely low attendance
Siesta
It's quite common in Southern Spain where you can't just go out after lunch in summer, but in most regions I've been siesta is only common among older people
Flamenco
Most of the people dont know shit about and is not a very popular kind of music anymore
That we're extroverts, always happy, funny and love to party people
In Spain there are a lot of types of people, including introverts, shy and calm people, just like everywhere else
Bullfights
Como otro spaniard redditor, te entiendo y te comprendo
No sé qué carajos se piensan los guiris y extranjeros para querer venirse a vivir a España sin tener ni papa del país o del idioma
Regarding the second,
Even in places where it is done "regularly" it is something that happens during town festivities and the like
So an average town will likely go between 360 and 364 days a year without a bullfight
Go some "non regular" place and it is perfectly normal to go years without bullfighting
However, in foreign shows they treat it like it's the local equivalent of football
Which leads is to
Bullfighting is not, and was never meant to be, a sport
Let alone some "fair" competition between man and animal
If you wish otherwise you might as well go to a slaugherhouse and complain that the pigs don't have a chance to run away
What about snails
Well, you should see Spanish movies from the 90s. If you don't see a dick or a scene of sexual intercourse, it's probably not a Spanish film
I don't remember if the movies of [Jamón Jamón] or [Lucía y el sexo] actually show dicks, but they're pretty representative examples of Spanish films from that time
They are pretty common in Spain
Interestingly, every house I've lived in here in Spain has one
And I don't think I've even used one 5 times
Any house with a bathroom made before 2005 in Spain usually has one
The ones made on the last years tend to use the [American method] or none
Not really sure it counts given that I'd argue those are Swedish jobs but in a different country but I'll concede working here is definitely easier for some
Certainly not if you are young, have no experience, don't speak the language and yet somehow expect to live comfortably in Spain while bartending a few hours on weekends, which is what way too many people plan to do
Maybe, but your bullfighting seems a lot less cruel from what I've seen
It's more about acrobatics and courage, [like this] right
Check out this [video] (warning: animal cruelty)
This is how it's usually done in Spain, they nail small pikes on the back of the bull to get it to slow down and get tired due to pain and blood loss
What you see in the hand of the bullfighter on the video is a real sword
They use it to cut the bulls ear as a prize when the bull has already fallen to the floor, exhausted
Then there's *rejoneo* with horses, which could be nice if it was just fooling around with the horse, but they also spike the bull making it bleed all over the place
Look at the bulls back on [this video] how shiny it is from the blood
I honestly hope we will forget about this Spanish shameful "tradition" as soon as possible
I went out for beers when I was 14 and no one ever asked for my ID
In big cities they might be more serious about it but my casual small town bars don't give a fuck
In the states they're super strict on that right
Like if you look under 30 they have to check ID or something
You can't buy alcohol under 18 but nobody will stop you drinking at home
Are people really expecting to get contact information for an illegal activity by asking anonimously in the internet
It's also quite common in Spain
Some Spanish regions eat them, but they're not common on the whole country
That's interesting, I'll have to check it out
Oh, I don't think we have censorship here either, but we do have a "children's schedule" between 6:00 and 22:00
I think it's forbidden by law to show content that could damage children's development during those hours
It probably includes sexual scenes, but it's mostly oriented to prevent kids from accidentally watching extreme violence, abuse, drug addiction, etc
Anything traumatising in general
There's no censorship at night, as far as I've seen
They usually show a warning with the age recommendation before movies
Boobs are kinda normal on Spanish TV anyway, we don't feel offended by nipples
The first boob that appeared on our TV was probably the one from the italian singer [Sabrina in 1987] That one was pretty famous
Haha I just called them American because that's what I've heard from some people that work doing house renovation projects
The truth is that I don't know if everybody calls them that way in my country of if they are actually popular in America
They're becoming popular here lately, since they're more comfortable than bidets and occupy less space
That happens a lot in Spain too
Most people don't even think they're being racist when they say bad stuff about gipsies
There's an Andalucía flair, what the fuck
Me lo pongo ahora mismo
Edit: just found out it's custom
It's the Nigerian flag, can't you add your own custom flags
I'd want to, but my family disagrees
Will try to watch it tomorrow
We are in the middle of family activities, they wouldn't appreciate it xD
So in 1808, for complex reasons, a large group of people assaulted the royal complex of Aranjuez looking for prime minister Godoy
They found him days later, hiding inside a rolled-up  carpet
[Sobrino de Botín ]
It’s the oldest restaurant in the world that’s still in business
It was founded in 1725 and it’s in Madrid close to Plaza Mayor
Modern parliamentarism is considered by the UNESCO to have first appeared in the *Cortes* (General Estates) of León in 1188, tho
Croquetas
I thought that they were eaten everywhere, but then not many people I've spoken to know what they are
Kissing twice on the cheeks when you introduce yourself
I thought ir was doing everywhere
Pretty embarrasing first time I travelled abroad and tried to kissed every stranger I met
Lemon fanta
The spanish persianas, it's a beefed up version of the blinds, that looks like it's only common in Spain
Most of the typical Spanish food comes from very particular places
For example paella is typical from Valencia
Although it is true that you can find typical food everywhere around Spain
People have no idea about this though
I thought that every country's stores stopped for a midday break and lunch until 4-5 PM
Growing up in South Africa it was a thing for glass bottles (as a youngster I used to scavenge bottles for the deposit to buy sweets)
But it disappeared after plastic became common
Well, I don't think we have those in Spain, but we do have regional recipes of crêpes, like the [frisuelos] from Asturias or filloas from Galicia
We make a roll with them to eat them (we eat them with our hands if we are at home), I haven't seen people do that at France
The most shocking recipe for filloas (not for everybody, I guess) is probably [the one that uses pig's blood]
This one has a lot to do with the cultural importance that the pig slaughtering day (matanza) had on small villages back in the day
It was a festive day because it meant that the family would have plenty of meat (meat used to be a luxury back then, especially for those who were poor) for the whole year (chorizo and spanish ham last for months easily)
Every part of the pig that could be eaten was used and valued
Edit: we also have a sweet for a religious day, the day when the three wise men (the Magi
Not sure how it's said in English) were supposed to go see Jesus
It's called the [roscón de reyes] and it usually has a bean and a small figurine of a king hidden inside it
I think you would have to be carrying a lot of it and the cops would need to have proof that you're selling it to get jail time for it in Spain
If there's no evidence that you're selling it and you don't have much on you, you'll probably just get an expensive fine if you get caught
I wouldn't risk it though, although I know a lot of people that get away with it regularly
It's a mash of various ingredients (jamón is the most common) and bechamel, covered in flour and fried
[Example]
It's not the same thing
Check out this recipe:
Most people don't use butter for cooking in Spain though
We usually prefer olive oil
I don't get the reference haha, what's in common between croquetas and FIFA19
They're not exactly the same thing
Here's a recipe that is more or less traditional:
That would be extremely tacky here and have political implications
Oh I see, Thanks ^^
Some of our most delicious desserts are: [churros] [torrijas] (french toast), [arroz con leche] (rice pudding), [turrón] [pestiños] [sobaos] [crema catalana] [ensaimada] [tarta de Santiago] and [polvorones] among other things
I'm surprised there aren't italians pointing out TIRAMISU
Best dessert ever
[roscón de reyes] is delicious too, and pretty in season right now
Hmmm and [quesada]
I LOVE POLVORONES
litterally the best dessert (in my opinion)
>It's popularity overseas has been rising thru the roof and it's well worth it
Absolutely worth It
The churros with filling although they aren’t famous in Spain since people prefer the traditional ones they are really popular in Latin America
>The origins are discussed though, so not sure it is 100% French
I mean catalan creme IS  way older, but apparently slightly different
That the Spanish Inquisition were a bunch of fanatics burning people left and right
While they did torture and kill people and persecute suspected Jews, Muslims, heretics, etc
(the number of executed people varies between 3000 and 10000 between the 15th and 19th centuries) they were more akin to a secret police furthering the interests of the Spanish crown and church, with its members being well-educated in law (more than the secular courts, where judges many times needed help from jurists because they just didn't know the law or the jurisprudence)
Speaking of Spain as a country before the Nueva Planta Decrees in the early 18th century
Related to this, saying that Naples or the Low Countries were "Spanish". They weren't Spanish
Nor Castilian
They were owned and ruled by the same guy who owned and ruled the Spanish kingdoms
I'm watching "Hernán" series right now and I am actually getting all the details
It's quite close to the scripts of Bernal Díaz del Castillo
To be honest, I don't think it helps that, on the Internet, it's rather common for Portuguese and Spanish speaking people to reply each other in their own language
Probably people that don't speak either don't stop to read and don't notice the difference, I mean, why would they
[this]
Also, the memes
Even before meme culture as we know it today was born, people repeated non stop things like "If Hitler had learned from Napoleon and had not invaded in winter, we'd be speaking German now
", or like "The French built those fortifications along their border with Germany and then the Germans invaded through Belgium and the forts were useless
". There are a lot of common statements like those that have been repeated ad nauseam so much that people think they have to be true
That actually happened in WWII
Soviet regiments such as the 588th Night Bomber Regiment used biplanes that were so slow that German fighters had a lot of trouble engaging them
Inb4 expected Sabaton
Nope, there's no special Christmas booze in Spain
Some companies have really tried to push one with ad campaigns but none has really stuck
Im cities not, but it is quite common outside major cities
In rural areas it definitely is common, but in towns near cities is also pretty common
Ninja edit: at least in Catalonia
I'd say that it might not that common in some other regions
In rural areas, for sure
Never saw it in urban areas
I don't know but that'll be impossible where winter in tough
Here in Granada it is used in cortijos (country houses) or small villages
But it is not common at all in towns or cities
A empire is always for the growing of the original nation
Very few times is good for the conqueredhaving said that, some were more brutal than others
I didn't. I guess everyone knows Spain thanks to the empire
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Nara, Kobe, Sapporo, Hakodate, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Nagano, Sendai, Fukushima, Kawasaki, Yokohama, Kamakura, Kagoshima
Tokyo, Edo, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kyoto, Sapporo, Yokohama
And I don't remember more, I was going to say Hokkaido, but I think it's an island, right now I don't remember more but if I saw their names I could remember them, I blame anime
Okay, let's try
Not many, I think
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukushima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Nagoya
I think that's all
In this thread I've learned that Kobe, Sapporo, Kawasaki and Yokohama are towns
I knew the names but not that they were places
Kyoto, Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Naha
Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Sapporo, Kobe, Saitama, Kyoto, Nara, Okinawa, Kanagawa, Nagasaki
That's all that comes to my mind right now
WAIT Kawasaki is a real place
Now that you mention them Saitama and Fukuoka ring a bell, but I don't know exactly why
In Spain is [Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente ] with his TV program El hombre y la Tierra (The Man and the Earth), he was the person who more contributed to environmental awareness in Spain and teached the people to love the Iberian Wolf that was near to extinction
His death was a shock for a whole generation of children that grown watching he on TV
Rodríguez de la Fuente, the first to bring attention about the importance of preserving the ecosystem and the dangers of human industry in Spain
He is kind of a legend Rest In Peace
Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente the man who made the documentary of "El hombre y la tierra"
(the men and the earth)
Felix Rodriguez De La Fuente
He was kind of a hippy, very invested in nature, environmentalism and such
He sadly died in an helicopter crash while making a documentary in Alaska
Anyone, please watch El Hombre y la Tierra, i swear it is amazing
I think it's available for free at the RTVE website and app, but it's probably only in Spanish
Our society is heavily polarized so the answer to the question depends on your ideology
From the left, its Santiago Abascal, leader of VOX
From the right, its probably Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos
Far right and far left respectively, very polarizing
Goign to go ahead and answer for everyone: The current prime minister
Listen, I know that all politicians in Spain are a bunch of corrupts and thieves
Both the government and the opposition
What I meant with Iglesias house is that he, if he wants to be a workers representative, he should live like an average worker, not like 'the casta' which, remember, wanted to eliminate
Long story short, he is a hypocrite
I find there is a good cross-section of the population that just cannot stand [Pablo Iglesias] It is kinda bewildering how much flack he gets not just from the right (which is to be expected) but also from people who actually agree with Podemos' policies
Even his right hand had an argument with him and left to create his own party
I mean, the guy is a bit brass, and the smear campaign against him was moderately successful, but the reactions he provokes are just visceral
Yes
The left voters in my family can't stand him but they can still sometimes vote for Podemos because they agree with some of their policies
That being said, the one that they hate the most right now is Ayuso which makes zero sense because we aren't from Madrid
Ayuso is making herself an easy target
I wonder if it is deliberate, the same way Esperanza Aguirre made sure nobody took her seriously while she consolidated her power
We have "emparedados" (that's the name I know them with, but apparently it can mean other things as well)
It's a sandwich (usually ham and cheese but can be anything), battered in egg and fried
Tastes amazing, but it's basically a calorie bomb as it absorbs a lot of oil
They're not that common, anyway
We don't *fry* sandwiches by here, we spread butter on the loaves and cook it on a grill, pan or sandwich maker
You can find fried sandwiches (with egg and oil) in American-inspired restaurants though
"Grilled Cheese Sandwiches" is the North American term, I believe
I make that for my son's school lunch every day
Cheap vacations, drugs, alcohol and scientific researchers
We offer asylum to old Germans & British
When the UE finances Spain is not only financing the Spanish people but also your grampas healthcare when they decide to retire here
Our main exports are vehicles, pharmaceuticals, oil, food, clothing and ceramics, so probably those
Also a safe, nice place to go on vacations with sunny weather and lots of sightseeing
>The only EU Member to openly hate the French
Doesn't everyone do that
I feel like in Spain we're not shy about it, especially since everyone is taught about how Napoleon betrayed us and invaded us and we fought back
In fact this invasion more or less created Spanish national identity - before that (and still in many ways after that) we more of a combination of kingdoms and there wasn't a sense of patriotic unity
MVP for sure
I didn't realize how necessary and obvious such a measure should have been earlier until they implemented it
Dale mi bro
You also showed to the world that having a working central government is not really that necessary
Are you Spanish
That sounds a lot like Spain
You mean Spanish like located in Spain
Well, our brightest minds learn English, I'm not talking about the average Spaniard guy
I mean, you're not wrong, but in recent years many if not all children learn English from a very young age
We obviously don't finish our school years with a native-like English level, but it's more than acceptable (as someone else mentioned, though, our pronunciation tends to be terrible)
As for third languages, most common options are French or German, but, at least in my experience, schools don't give them much importance
They're just two hours a week for the 6 last years of high school at best
Many people, me included, stop taking those classes after 2 or 3 years
And unlike English, you don't find lots of media in those languages, so young people don't really find it useful in the short term
Spanish migration is a thing
Is it really that important though
I feel like it's the opposite of where the EU should be going
Every country's citizens pay for their own roads and every other country's citizens gets to use them for free, just like we all get to pay national rates for university across the EU, just like we get no roaming charges, and so on
If only Germany were to implement this toll it would be one-sided and if every country were to implement this it would be
unnecessary, imo
I get why the court ruled that way
In the coast people speak English because our main income comes from tourists
Our general level is poor, but new generations are more open minded to learn (and travel)
I mean, I kind of get it
If every EU country starts implementing policies like that, targeted at EU citizens from other countries, it kind of defeats the whole point of the economic union
If you have extra tolls and taxes it stops being so seamless to cross a border or move someplace else
I think having a general rule that all EU citizens should be treated the same by companies and the government is good
>Are you aware of a country like France
Where you have to pay about 10€ per 100 kilometres of motorway
Or Austria, where you have to buy a one week ticket in advance even if you want to use the motorways only for one day
And they were the ones who complained
Nope, was not aware
If it's only for foreigners and it applies to EU citizens it seems to me that it should be struck down as well based on precedent
> Universities are also not a good example because they are also financed by the tax payer but free to use for everyone
Just like the motorways and other roads
My point is that yes, you have to pay for foreigners to use your roads and unis
But in exchange you and everyone else gets to drive, study or work anywhere else in the EU under the same conditions
It seems to me like a fair deal
Ferdinand VII
After liberals successfully leadered the resistance against Napoleon and kicked out the French alongside the Brits and the Portuguese, he went back to Spain
He was called "the Desired" and was seen as a symbol of Spain's independence
But instead of keeping the new constitution enacted during the war, that established national sovereignty, a constitutional monarchy and universal suffrage, he abolished it and reinstated absolutism
He began a brutal campaign against the political opposition and when a liberal coup d'état forced him to accept a constitution, the Holy Alliance invaded the country and put him back in power
His authoritarianism and mismanagement of the country set us back for decades and wasn't even capable of solving the succession issue, which would cause three civil wars during the 19th century between the *isabelinos* (supporters of Isabella II's line) and the *carlistas* (supporters of her uncle Carlos' line)
History nowadays knows him as "the Felon king" and the worst ruler Spain has ever had
[Fernando VII of Spain] was the biggest reason the Spanish Empire fell when it did
When he came back to Spain he crushed liberal movements so hard that the same guerrilleros who had fought for him against the French became his worst enemies
**He scrapped the first constitution of this country** which was incredibly modern, with (if I remember correctly) universal male suffrage, and could have seriously helped address the valid protests from the American territories
At some point a liberal coup happened and **the guy literally called a [foreign army] into Spanish soil to put himself back into absolute power**. He prevented all attempts of modernizing and reforming the country, denied representation to the American viceroyalties, **which they had had during the war against the French**.
Hey I had the same answer
Fuck him, probably the worst king in our history
It's nice to see an answer at top in AskEurope
Usually the Spain answer is at the bottom of the thread ignored xD
People are stupid
They wanted this tyrant instead of all progress the French liberalism could have given the country
And the reason is purely blind nationalism
It has always been, is and always will be the cancer of societies
Yet we don't learn
Also, I think Franco and company should feature here
Literal traitors and all
Ah, the wonderful French liberalism that came at the point of a bayonette and was flabbergasted that Spaniards understood "being like the French" as "having the same rights as the French" and not as "being bossed by France".
Charles II wasn't a ruler
He was too ill to rule
He left his favourites in charge, and in fact they did a pretty decent job with what they had, helping to recover the economy from the 1640s crisis
But they couldn't do much in the different wars the Crown was still involved from previous reigns and because of the issue of succession
Ferdinand VII wasn't ill, he was just an asshole
A dumb one, too, because he didn't take any advantage at all of Spain's position as one of the allies that defeated Napoleon, alienated the American colonies that only wanted some provileges and not independence with his brutal repression in the Americas, put his friends in the cabinet instead of people who actually were interested in ruling the country and not their personal profit
I could go on and on
Actually her mother and regent queen, Mariana of Austria, was a good ruler
But Charles II is the Hapsburg meme so
Right
I don't know why I didn't think about those "people". I guess I was influenced by seeing people here talking about people from older times
>it's a miracle you still have one
It is still a pretty heated topic tbh
But yeah, we were at some point cursed by bad leaders and to this day cant shake that shit off
Oh well, I'll just keep drinking to a new republic
Of course it was far from ideal but still better than rotten tyrannical feudal ideas
The biggest political party in the country (that won the elections a few weeks ago) commited a fraud of about 700 million euros (the judge said they were guilty yesterday)
The Spanish Big Brother show recorded and streamed on national live TV the alleged rape/abuse of one of the contestants by a fellow contestant
Then, flash forward a couple days or weeks, they locked the girl in a room by herself, showed her the video on a TV and refused to let her out even when she was going through a mental breakdown and anxiety attack, all this while promising help was arriving at the room (a lie)
Everybody is outraged, and rightly so
I thought that int his type of places the usual was giving children in adoption
In Spain they used to sell the children to wealthy infertile couples during Francoism
My guess is that this were probably births that went wrong and the order hid it to avoid scandal regarding the conditions in which they had those young mothers
How did a democratic country like Ireland allow this to happen
In Spain it happened as the well (the stolen children of Francoism)
But it happened because the dictatorship created a context where church institutions had a lot of power and where corruption favouring the church and the wealthy was *very* widespread so everything was covered up
The language is called Serbo-Croatian (or Serbo-Croat-Bosnian or Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian-Montenegrin) by foreigner academics after all
It's a pluricentric language with four different standards, two different alphabets and many regional dialects, but it is linguistically the same language
Why don't Irish people speak on the bus
And why, if they have a need to communicate, whisper
The moment I questioned this I was hit by a universal truth:
##THE STEREOTYPE IS TRUE: WE, SPANISH PEOPLE, ARE _L O U D_  AS FUCK
I moved to the south of the country and I can't understand my own language
I continuously have to ask people to repeat what they said and it's really awkward
Yes, at least in Spain it is
Nowadays it's called defense
From 1834 to 1937 it was called Ministry of War and during the dictatorship we had 3 Ministries: Army, Navy and Air
Yes, its the "Ministerio de Defensa" wich means exactly what you think it means
I think pretty much all countries named it the "Ministry of War" in the 30's. I know ours did
Both are official languages in Finland, aren't they
a lot of countries called it ministry of war but in modern times that had change
In Spain, sports have usually been part of the Ministry of education
Mens sana in corpore sano and all that stuff
well if you have the equipment training a force is not that hard
the quality of it will be in doubt but countries like swizerland depends on that if i dont get it wrong
in your defense i can say that we have a ton of ministers
Im introvert, while spaniards "have to be" extroverts, easygoing, funny people
I don't like sleeping the ''siesta''. I have done it less than 30 times in my life, and all of them have been terrible
It usually gives me a sensation of disorientation and a headache similar to those you experience when you have hangover
Plus I think sleeping siesta is for lazy people
I don't like ham, seriously, I don't even want it
I have discovered the joys of shocks + flip flops
I hate bullfighting and I don't really like paella
I can't stand hot weather and suck at football
I don't like football at all
I don’t really like tortilla de patatas
And when I do eat it, I prefer it with onion
I dislike the weather
I don’t take siestas
I am horrible at mountain climbing, don't like classical music that much, don't hate Germans and I am not so fond of Kaiserschmarrn
Guiri
Was going to write this
Also, I don't like partying much and prefer a proper sit-down restaurant to tapas in a bar
Oh, I also hate bullfighting, but this is common
And now I'm not sure if I should be the writing this because my safety could be at risk, but
I've eated oranges consistently better than the Valencia ones (in Egypt) and seafood better (and much, much cheaper) than the Galician ones (in Cape Town, South Africa)
... Are you a northerner
Do Turks take religion very seriously
For example most of catholics I know identify as catholic but they dont put a step in the church if its not for something important like a wedding or a funeral
No, I'm from Mallorca
Hmmm, I have tried with air conditioners too, but the hangover-like feeling continues, I think it is because I get really disoriented when I wake up, my body thinks it is new day hahaha
I see, thanks for replying
"No te hagas el sueco" which means "don't play the Swede".
It makes reference to when someone pretends to not understand or play dumb to get away with something
I don't know where it comes from, Swedes seem like clever people to me
"Esto es un trabajo de chinos" = This is a work for the Chinese
It refers to work that is very difficut in the sense that it requires being very meticoulous, patient and perfectionist
I think it originally came from the Chinese porcelain manufactures
"Hacerse el sueco"
Kinda means "to behave like a Swedish", and is used for when you play ignorant in a topic you know about
I have no clue where this comes from
Vendrá por los turistas suecos que pueblan nuestras costas, que más de una vez no se enteran al hablarles en español
En realidad el sueco de esa expresión viene de "zueco" (soccus en latín), el zapato de madera medieval y antiguo
Solo que con el tiempo la etimología se confundió y la gente empezó a pensar que se referia a las personas suecas :P

It turns out it was just about Norwegians whoring around in my country but sure we make everything a completely mess
Does killing bulls for the show count
Is an amazing custom, really
So do you leave the heat on or what
Doesn't that consume your car battery
Wtf
And wht if something happens to him
That's like leaving your baby in the house
In Spain it depends on the generation
Old university teachers used to be addressed formally, but with younger ones the name is fine
In Spain the order is strictly kept
It would be really rude not to do so
IMO very much uncontroversial outside your borders too
Only with an opposite opinion
Is Malta progressive or conservative
What you just said makes me think conservative, but then I recently saw one of these homosexual acceptancy graphcs and Malta was really high
Plus the lower age for alcohol consumption and the stripclubs
Although I guess the latter is present for tourism more than anything, but just the fact that they allow it is significant
Anglos seem obsessed with pedophilia
We have them too
It is like this here too, more in the small cities and rural areas where life is more slow
But still there's much political correction and I'd say gypsies are treated much better here than in Eastern Euro countries
In addition, I don't think these negative comments are because of racism but bc of their behavior as a collective
Can confirm for Spain
I think that we only have documentals about the civil war
Take a look at "En construcción" by José Luis Guerín. 2001
*An author spent a year and a half filming what happened as a new apartment building was built in the El Chino neighborhood of Barcelona
En Construccion focuses less on the practicalities of raising a building than the impact the project has on those who live in the neighborhood, including a teenage couple squatting in a nearby building, an illegal alien looking for work for himself and his son, and a neighborhood girl who becomes infatuated with one of the construction workers
The death of a stray cat and the discovery of a mass grave during construction also points to the tragic losses that are sometimes part and parcel of progress

> from u/Xavier_Carax - thanks Bud
My pleasure
~~Definitely not true
Just for info:
[Memoria de España] is a fairly decent series and a very famous one, from the big bang to Gonzalez/Aznar
As far as a documentary produced by state's TV can go, it's among the best you can find
I don't know if it's available in English though
Not really, you can find a lot of documents in the [archivo histórico del nodo]  be it historic events, sports, everyday life and of course war and whatnot
Also there are a lot of documentaries on youtube, I guess if someone is interested enough it would be easy for them to find
but well here you have a big bunch but i think that all are in spanish so sorry
Histocast has also a great podcast but again only in spanish
[HistoCast]
(Also a lot of history of other matters but they have a lot abaut Spain)
the only ones i know (that arent documentaries are more historic shows) are pretty specific such as Isabel or Carlos depicting the lives of Isabel I the Catholic queen and Carlos with Charles the I of Spain and V of Germany
It was a joke
Sorry, not very fresh after work :/
Hahaha no problem, it's good that you added a link to something interesting, my joke doesn't add that much to the conversation
Eating grapes on new years eve, one grape for every time the bell tolls at 00:00 (so 12 grapes in total, pretty quickly)
Makes for some funny moments
One of out traditional games is: *let's both take an ax and see who is the one that cuts this log in half first*
Sevillanas WHEN accompanied with clapping and chanting with terrible voices and the most uneducated Spanish accent possible
I wrote an essay about that in French class
It's fucking crazy mate
We burn and bury the doll of a giant sardine at the end of carnival here
Now I wanna do that
Spain seconds this
Molt bona
We watch Grease, idk why
Yeah, Home Alone is also aired in Spain around Xmas
Yas, we do
Thanks
Seems really fun
Vice is
An interesting source
most historical figures have somehting controversial about them, specially if you look at them from a modern perspective
The catholic monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, were extremely important to Spain's history (since they fucking founded the country by marrying) but they were both warmongers and catholic fanatics
The expelled the jews and muslims the moment they gained control over the peninsula
but they were nontheless awesome
its purely subjective, most people, including politicians or in some cases dictators, only want "the best", and arent inherently evil
While conquistadores usually get (unjustly IMO) the bad rap, Christopher Columbus was a real asshole that even got his bones in jail for mistreatment of the natives
You consider "good" as the default
Hey that's kink shaming
I'm surprised that one of the main fascist leaders has a good fame
The french asked us to go through Spain to invade Portugal, we agreed and once they had all their army here they invaded us
Never trust the french
In their defense, I’d rather have Napoleon than Fernando VII and Carlos IV
I'd rather have a drunk and blind monkey than those two guys
Don't worry they helped us keep him too
"WE ARE SAVING THE KING, PLEASE DO NOT RESIST"
Definitely [Liechtenstein] for me
The black colour is sick, and it has a symbol which is always a plus in my book
I also like [Andorra] simple, big numbers, coat of arms and a big PRINCIPAT D'ANDORRA written so you can drive full of national pride
Thanks for pointing it out
One could say Benidorm: it evolved from a small fishermen village to [this]  If you ask me, this artificial jungle of steel is not what I call evolution, but whatever
Shenzhen de Hacendado
I think a lot of people are really sad about this evolution in a lot of cities
Others appreciate how much money tourism provides, but I believe a vast majority of people think this is too much
Personally, I hate this (I even edited the comment to avoid being too harsh)
In a lot of cities, the natural landscape [has been slaughtered]  and beautiful cities with culture and history have been turned into decadent theme parks, just like Benidorm
The photo is from El Algarrobico, in the coast of Almería. It's one of the most beautiful landscapes and they just destroyed the coastline to put that thing there
To me, this is utterly disgusting
[La Manga del Mar Menor then]  vs [La Manga del Mar Menor now]

A correct, or at least fitting, timezone
This remains me, the last weekend me and my bf's family were doing a barbecue in theirs garden and we start the fire as usual
Suddenly a little (not so little) lizzard ran from the brigs of the barbecue
It seems this was his home and we fire it
To be fair, Inditex and the sort don't help with low prices compared to other countries
And I don't trust used electronics as well
Hehehe
I don´t understand how in Germany small towns with less than a 100 people have fiber glass internet with high speed (like my cousin) but then the big cities are not able to get decent internet at cheap prices
I would say Germans value to pay instantly, without debts and like to know their exact economic balance
With cash it is very easy to see, with card, specially if Credit Card, it is much less obvious to follow
At least that´s the reason my dad always used cash (born and living in Bavaria), the typical german in his 50s. But now he also pays mostly with card because convience and discount on pays, so even Germany is changing
Nobody in Spain writes it without the stroke as far as I know
Both are perfectly acceptable and widely used
I usually put a line in the middle, out of habit, but I don't care much about it
Well It depends, when writting without, when describing the whole numbers, with
I actually write it like that
I do, at least in lower case
The upper case has to have it, tho, if not poor Zorro has been teaching us wrong
Wait, whaaaaat
q doesn't have a stroke everywere
I've never ever would have thought of it
Everyone i know writes the q with the line here
Looool that is also done, and also, virtually nobody writes a Q without a stroke, and to add more, also 7 is written with a stroke
Tbh I have no idea, we are just taught to write it that way
Somewhat, most of the cases with second names are like compound/compoded names, like José María, María José, Juan Antonio, José Antonio, Juan José, and maybe others
They are said fully, not one of them, and sometimes if know them and are somewhat close to them, you pronounce a abbreviated version of the two names: Juanan = Juan Antonio, Josema = José María, JJ or Juanjo = Juan José.
We have 2 family/last names so we don't need more names
Name + Father's first lastname + Mother's first lastname
It's very usual, mostly in older people
There was a time in Spain where all girls had to have 'María' and boys 'José' as their first name for religious reasons
So tons of María 2ndName and José 2ndName here
Somewhat common
I'd say not having middle names is more common, specially with younger people, but they are still not rare
But never forget
Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos xD
And taking into account that in Spain there are two surnames, so there are people with 2 names (or more) and 2 surnames
Sometimes you still to the full name, sometimes you use one or the other, usually the first one, but not always
For example people called *Francisco Javier* usually go by *Javier* rather than *Francisco*. And as you said hypocorisms as very common as well, some people limit their use to their relatives and closer friends but go by their full names in other environments
No, no, no, it's Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos *de Marichalar y Borbón.*
Yeah
Also compound surnames are not uncommon either
So a name like María Dolores González Cabeza de Vaca is perfectly fine
Or 'María José', 'María Jesús'... for the same reason
But what happens with Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos de Marichalar y Borbón? It's he better than everyone because belongs to the royal family
But I agree that more than 2 names are too many
No idea
A lot of people from non latin countries change their last names when they get married
We are the different ones xD
I only learned about that fact fairly recently and I still can't get over it
That's a thing in Spain too
When I found out most people do the opposite in other countries I was really weirded out
I can't be barefoot at home
"So weird to think about that here, even though we don't even have lyrics
Everyonr stands up and goes "chunda chunda"
I would not say it is so odd in many places of Europe
In Spain is common to smile or talk to strangers for example
I've noticed that watching a movie in the US
Like, why
Do you think the crew is here or what
But id no one tips, no waitress is going to work and the business goes default or start paying a living wage
That's not rude, because that question has lots its meaning and in that context it's a formality to say hello in a friendly manner
It's like when you say goodmorning even when the morning is shit
Sure, they just aren't as common for us because we don't use the car that often
Every customary unit is defined metrically, so at least they have that going
It's a cultural thing
We use slippers
If I get at *my* home I'm going to get changed to more comfortable wear, including shoes (slippers)
Although if you're heading out soon you're just going to keep them on
But if you go to someone's house, we never take them off
All houses and main buildings entrances have mats
If it gets dirty you just get a mop and clean it
I actually find someone else's smelly and sweaty feet more disgusting than getting the floor a bit dirty from their shoes
I'll just clean afterwards
The Science Museum in Granada, Spain is pretty cool: [
I think the [City of Arts and Science of Valencia] is the perfect example
i could see myself in that building
I'm not against integration, the question should be "Which conditions need to be met to form a real European Union"
It would be such a dream to be able to get on a train from any major city, and barring stopovers, be able to get outside of the peninsula on high speed
Technically yes, you can get on an Ave to Barcelona and change trains to get to the outside, ~~but the rest of Spain might not have that access much longer~~. I mean, look at Irun,  it’s our connection to the North Atlantic railway corridor
with only regular-speed access to the rest of Spain
It’s embarrassing
>I'd switch from national lists to european parties voted by everyone
The European Parliament is voted differently from one country to another, as long as it's proportional representation
The lack of a unique system is nonsensical
>single currency
Working on it
There's one less outlier
I agree on everything tbh
I want transparency
Like, complete one
What would this do for self-government *within* EU countries, though
There are already federal countries, united kingdoms, and other legal figures for self-governing regions
My own country has a very complex balance of national and regional power, one that is currently causing quite a lot of conflict, and let's just say it's *not* the first time
So I wonder, how would an even bigger state power, along with the usual national power, balance with self-governance
National governments already do have balances on taxing, powers and policy, and making a pan-European framework that would fit the constitutional requirements of all pseudofederal entities in the union seems like a bit of a nightmare, if not impossible
On top of that, would it be allowed for countries to leave, as it is now
Because that is a pretty stark difference between examples of federal macro-countries in other continents, and it would perhaps change the willingness of all countries to go through with it
I think I'd like it to happen, as long as it does not become an imperialist force and actually veers more towards a social state (but not just in name, like mine is defined to be in the very first article of its Constitution)
I'm thinking about what it took to constitute the EEC in the first place
and I'm hoping we don't have to have a 30's and 40's repeat
Thousands of miles away
Are you a french colony
Do you want another “Berlin Airport”? Because that’s how you get another Berlin Airport situation
If they were to start replacing the tracks today, at this very moment, my grandchildren will probably be the ones to see them complete the operation
Am I being a little skeptical
Yes quite a bit, but it isn’t exactly unjustified
I cried green tears of envy a while back when a dutch person mentioned that their country could do roadworks through the night and it be ready by the morning, while there’s a 500m elevated highway overpass that I take daily that has been out of commission since August
Our would be a white collar princess-thief and the badie of the tale
Isabel II
well we dont have good options in history
the more famoues was Isabel the I and i dont see a disney cartoon about conquering the muslims and expelling jews while marryng your cousin
With ww2 related events
Not deep though
Just: soviet attack, soviets die, pyrrhic victory, Germany attacks, Finland joins, soviets win
we arent taught anything about it at school but i've learnt from a really good book explaining the campaign in detail by Richard W Condom
It wasn't the Rosenbergs who passed US nuclear secrets to the Soviets, it was the cockroaches in the laboratories
I mean, does it count the whole city of Rome if you are italian
You do have impressive 20th and 21st century architecture

Catalonia
It's kinda fucked up to show it at kid hours
Well, to be honest that's not a "small controversy".
So who do they want to cut off
Some guys declared independence, it went against the constitution they jured, so they became jailed, and their followers went crazy
Wait, really
The Turkish refugee
It's always the yanks saying that bullshit lol
I take a siesta regularly, I really need them
i like to pretend i dont speak english and use the spanish question marks
I went to Cornwall and started speaking with the natives just like a proper Spaniard
Close contact, a big smile, some sort of small talk and a slightly elevated volume just to make sure they understand me
For several years, while I lived close to my parents, I went there almost every Sunday to have paella
Take a siesta when I can (weekend or holidays)
Usually go to bed at 1-2am
Woke up at 12pm watched a soccer game, came back home, ate paella, slept for half an hour, went to watch the bulls, had some beers with my friends and saw a flamenco performance
Most stereotypical day of my life as a Spaniard in Feria de Sevilla
Well, I eat lunch at 15:00-16:00 everyday and dinner at 22:00-23:00
Oh my god, that's so funny
You'd have a lot of trouble in some cities of my country where you have to wave at the driver so they'll know that they have to stop
If it had been in Mallorca it would be peak tourist German
"by accident"
Same here
Other Spanish people hate walking around the city with me because I hate crossing when cars are coming my way
In Spain we allow double citizenship treaties with countries with "strong links to Spain" specially Iberoamerican countries
I'm happy with it because it allows to get Spanish citizenship without losing your previous one, and viceversa, which makes everything easier in terms of bureaucracy
It's true but there's a loophole
I have friends who got the British citizenship and you can always get your nationality back if you ask for it  in the next 3 years after denouncing your Spanish citizenship and then keep both
It's quite common, actually
[source]
I think you can actually have any double nationality as long as you don't stop making use of the Spanish one, and male an official declaration that you want to keep it
As a double Filipino and Spanish citizen (e: by birth), [I think they’re neat]
Cope and seethe citizenshiplet
According to art
24 Civil Code, if a Spanish citizen resides abroad and acquires another citizenship, he will lose Spanish citizenship in a three years term unless he declares his will to keep it
This won't happen if said citizenship is an Iberoamerican country, Portugal, Andorra, Guinea, or the Philippines, or if there's a double citizenship treaty
If you had Spanish citizenship and you lose it you won't have to acquire it again
You can recover it by legally residing in Spain and declaring your will to recover it according to art 26 Civil Code
All in all, these declarations are more bureaucracy but there would be no serious issue
Wait, then double citizens vote twice
> as opposed to places with a more "civic" tradition (eg
UK, France)
Don't most of those countries have a colonial past
Can it be related to it
It's certainly the case of Spain
Oddly specific, here in Spain we had a massive wave in the late 80's and 90's, it was unknown and it spread because we had a huge (very huge) heroin epidemic that came with the decay of heavy industry and manufacturing, so people who weren't conscious of it shared needles all the time and many contracted the virus that way
Also worth mentioning unprotected sex in the first years of sexual revolution (very catholic country freshly out of a fascist dictatorship so sex education was non existent at the time) although to my understanding it wasn't as significant as the drugs issue regarding AIDS
It spread a lot in Spain during the 80's, when there was a drug epidemic and people would share syringes, but i dont know much more on the subject
It was not seen as a gay disease but as something related to drug use, blood transfusions and sex in general
French sounds very sophisticated, a little too much I'd say, almost superb
Italian for me takes the cake, it has a unique and beautiful sonority, it feels romantic but in a lighthearted way
Italian
But all languages can be very beautiful depending on the person speaking them
French on a woman is everything I wish for
I have a thing for Yorkshire accents too
Thanks for the compliment, random frenchman
French, Galician and Catalan
Why do you like German
I think it's not fair to compare the sound of your own language, to you it just sounds normal
Thank you, very well explained
I don't really mind the jokes if they are well though or original, things like the French are cowards, the evil Russians, etc
are starting to get (or already are) annoying
PS: If somebody could explain to me why people find so great the "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" quote I would be grateful
I hate all those jokes about how irrelevant is that European country whose name I don't remember or care
I dislike the nazi jokes or insults
Most germans alive right now have nothing to do with nazis (most of them weren't even born in 1945) so I don't see the point
I don't like seeing Italy and Portugal getting insults either
Don’t make jokes about communism unless you’re from a former communist country yourself
It’s some very rough history
On the Spanish Inquisition thing, just own it dude
I recently went on a trip to a few cities in Europe with a bunch of friends, we all live in Spain although some were not Spanish
Pretty big group, 7 of us
Greek dude said “no one expects the Spanish Inquisition” as we walked into our first hostal and it stuck from there lmao
We said that when we would go into a train, new hostal or whatever
Difficult to erase as many countries feed their nationalist rhetoric with it
Oh no
OH NO
AW LAWD, THEY COMING
TAKE SHELTER
Enano, that means to dwarf
but I'm taller than my father
Well, my parents never really gave me a nickname but I used to spend a lot of time with my  grandparents since my parents worked a lot (mom had 3 jobs and dad worked 11h/day)
One of my grandmas would call me 'sorgiña' which means 'witch' in basque because witches are part of our culture and I really enjoyed their tales as a kid
My other grandma called me 'mi gitana' which would translate from spanish to 'my gypsi', no idea why tho
They call me "Uly" or "Xavi", which is the diminutive of my two names, the first one being "Ulysses" and the second one "Xavier".
Sorgintxo that means little witch in Basque
I always loved it
Patata: it means potato, because my face was very round
Princesa descalcita: it means little barefoot princess, because I hated wearing shoes
Rata verde de alcantarilla: it means green sewer rat, I have no idea where that one comes from, but I hated it because I wanted to be a red sewer rat, not a green one
My brother was the red one and we used to argue about it
Mom used yo call me "Enano" which is midget or dwarf in spanish
Not very appropriate by today's standards
My name is Alejandro, so they used to call me (and still do) Jandrito
My dad also used to call me enano/nano because I am the younger son
I’ve always been called by my name
When I behaved bad some other names were use as: Cabezon, capullo or ¿quieres que te de con la chancla
I called my brother that
Well, in Basque, I used to call him "txiki" now he's almost 40 cm taller than me
Same as you, they call me enano because of I am the last one but I am also the tallest
Well, enano is dwarf, yeah, but in this context it means little/young one
Oh my God
My father also called me that
In my case it was "sorgintxo" but same thing
Spaniard here
Not a thing in Spain and I am very confused on how this works lol
Maybe in southmerican Spanish is a thing
My retired uncle is still "the kid/boy". Like, I only realised that was not his actual name when I was a teenager
Even his friends call him the kid
I am "the kid/girl" (I am 34), a nickname I share with a 60 year old aunt
The family have to guess by context which of us someone is talking about
No, he is like 1,80m and I'm 1,85m
Oh, sorry, I don't know where my flare went to haha
I'm from València, Spain
Hahaha, no
It uses the less common ways to speak, you are going to be right but you are also going to sound a little strange
Only of you want to learn Spanish with Latinamerican accent
With Spanish, I do the talking in the listening exercises so that my bf gets used to an accent from Spain
It's Latin American in Duolingo and there is no option for European Spanish :(
Probably
My bf is learning with Duolingo and I have to be constantly explaining that "we don't use that word", ot "that is not the standard phrase in Spain", or "this word sounds archaic", etc
That said, it has helped him with sentence structure, some vocabulary (this is one of the trickiest parts because it can be quite different in Latin America) and verb conjugation
I just need to keep an eye on it and explain the differences when they come up
Edit: forgot to say that I do the talking in the listening exercises for my bf so that he gets used to an accent from Spain
Hahaha, yeah, this is why my bf only uses Duolingo if I am there to keep an eye on what they are teaching him
Yeah, they mix things, but they don't tell you
So you might end up building a sentence the Spanish way, but using Mexican vocabulary, or saying it in a Mexican accent, for example
Here it's the same, but with domestic violence
Cigarette ads are still legal in Germany
How's the republican movement in the Netherlands
I'd say Spain has the strongest among all Europe (around 30-40%)
Oh God you're [not kidding] Very suprising to see, in Spain it tends to be 4-5€ per pack
I am glad I don't smoke and I kinda think it's a good thing that it's expensive, but I feel for poor fellas who somoke
That's not true at all
>Smoking was associated with a greater mean annual healthcare cost of €1600 per living individual during follow-up
However, due to a shorter lifespan of 8
6 years, smokers’ mean total healthcare costs during the entire study period were actually €4700 lower than for non-smokers
For the same reason, each smoker missed 7
3 years (€126 850) of pension
Overall, smokers’ average net contribution to the public finance balance was €133 800 greater per individual compared with non-smokers
It's kind to call it cosmetic
there's tons of feeling on there
It's still genital mutilation, albeit a bit less horrific than the female version
But it's not a log as in shit, it's a log as in a tree
They beat the everloving shit out of it and then ask for presents, like a very violent assault with robbery against a plant
And the Portuguese city of Braga is the Spanish word for panties
At least that is what I remember a friend from Barcelona told me they did as kids
Honest question, why does Scandinavia include Denmark
If by Scandinavia we mean the peninsula
Well, I'm sorry but Scania has been Swedish for a couple of centuries already
I once got Pepsi instead of Coke with the pizza I ordered
I tried to drink it but couldn't even drink half of it
I also don't like beer, taste is a pretty personal thing
Well, Iberian languages include Portuguese and Castillian and nobody would say that Argentina and Brazil are Iberian nations
Okay, but if we're going by cultural definitions why not include Finland
Is Finnish culture that different from Swedish, for example
I've never been to Finland but it doesn't look like that to me
That's my point
If we're going by geography, Scandinavia should include only Norway and Sweden
If we're goinf by culture, it should include Finland and Iceland as well, shouldn't it
Including Denmark but not the other two feel arbitraty to me
Most often than not (99% of the times), I know what gender a word is
Sometimes, it can be hard for different reasons
Some examples of situations one may struggle with, that I can think of right now, are:
* __Libido__: it's feminine
When I learned the word, I remember thinking it was "el libido" because it ends on an "o". It's not, it's "la libido". Now saying it in masculine just sounds weird
* __Words that, due to cacophony, use a different article__: like the word for water, *agua*, it's feminine, but we say "el agua", not "la agua"; or the word for fairy, *hada*, "el hada". In these cases the confusion isn't on what article you use, but the gender
So for instance, the confusion could come with the gender of the adjective: "el hada bonita", "el agua cristalina"... See
The article is masculine, but the adjective feminine
Edit: added the explanation *because it ends on an "o"*
In spanish if a word ends in A it's usually feminine, but there are exceptions like el mapa, when ypu encounter these exceptions all you can do is memororize them
In Spain we use the feminine "La nutella" but we dont have neutral gender
>Most often than not (99% of the times), I know what gender a word is
However a fun thing happens when A word is new
we effectively guess as a society it's gender
For example, covid, which is technically feminine, has been considered masculine by the population
What it's important to remember is that it's guesswork
You can be very good at it, but there's no 100% effective way to guess
As a native, I guess it's about intuition
We just know in most situations
It's more about exposing your brain to all of those words through reading and listening more than it is about memorizing
Because as a native you obviously get that kind of exposure to the language, it becomes intuitive to know the gender of a word, even if you've never seen that word before
I didn't know the rules, but I looked it up and it may not be as arbitrary as you think:
* If a word ends in -aje or -ambre; it's usually masculine
Most important exception: el hambre (masculine article due to cacophony, but the word is feminine)
* if a word ends in -ie, -nte, and -umbre; it's usually feminine
Notable exceptions: diente and puente
Your examples, sadly, wouldn't be part of any of the rules
So with those, yeap, it's pretty much about exposure and adquiring that intuiton-based knowledge that makes you don't need to think about it
Pretty much what you said
With words that are already established and have a dictionary entry, we guessed, and usually we are correct
In the weird instances we're not, we realize our mistake and move on
But with new words, as you said, it's just everyone guessing
We don't know which is correct, and you can argue for one or the other gender, but as long as a word isn't well established, we are all just guessing
Personally, with covid I used to refer to it as masculine
I didn't thought of what it meant in English
Then, people started saying it was feminine because it meant "enfermedad por coronavirus", so I changed it to feminine, as feminine made much more sense
At first it was weird saying it with the feminine article, but then it became normal and now I can't say "el covid". after the switch it just sounds so wrong xd
its not that
If everithing is feminine we use the feminine but in every other case we use masculine
the neutral gender is totally a diferent thing that we get rid when we stoped using Latin
That's for clearly mixed, not for unclear
If it helps, Mädchen is technically a diminutive, and diminutives are neuter
> Personally, with covid I used to refer to it as masculine
I didn't thought of what it meant in English
Then, people started saying it was feminine because it meant "enfermedad por coronavirus", so I changed it to feminine, as feminine made much more sense
At first it was weird saying it with the feminine article, but then it became normal and now I can't say "el covid". after the switch it just sounds so wrong xd
And for others (hi
), we learned it early on as “covid = corona +virus”, and virus is masculine, so obviously covid is masculine too
I’m sure that my brain will eventually accept it as feminine, but until then…
the french master in uniting Germany
There are quite a few in Spain but it doesn't sound as common as in Germany
At least they are pretty and with a good end
I think that they are better than the American thriller-murder films that put Antena 3 or the catastrophic low quality films of Cuatro and La Sexta xD
Apart from Das Boot and Die Welle, every single German film I have seen has been absolute trash
Sunday evening Antena3 movies have become their own genre
And it's not good
Good old Lavalantula
It's always about a woman whose husband/boyfriend is evil or about little girls being kidnapped
Lazy Town
I watched that so much as a child, I didn’t even like or enjoy it, jut it just seemed to always be on TV
I still need to watch that masterpiece
That show was epic
Yes, it’s always a 40-50 year-old German woman having a mid-life crisis and finding love and adventure in the cheesiest way
I secretly love them
There is one where she goes to some place in Africa and it’s such a white savior movie that it would have been banned in the USA
I also like to change it to German without subtitles and see how much I can understand (I’m always trying to learn) or make wild stories in my head about what is really going on
They are the best, 14/10
Bull fighting
It's inhumane and most people in Spain are against it
Ammusing: everyone can play the guitar and we shout OLÉ at random intervals
¡OLÉ!
That we all like flamenco and bullfighting
I thought about right-wing conservatives, but oh well
The most common stereotype is that they are gypsies, but that doesn't make any sense, as they only account for around 3% of the population, while in Bulgaria and North Macedonia they account for 10%
And Italy with southern Italians
What is with the people from the southern part of any given country
There are plenty, and in many provinces it is already illegal
In Granada they turned the bull ring into a bunch of night clubs
And because Americans know literally nothing about European history before the world wars and keep repiting the same jokes about the 20th century like if it was all there ever happened
Then, because of the prevalence of those jokes in American media, people all over the world have started repeating them
There are many Spaniards that make that joke and I'm always pissed even if I'm not French
Do they even know how many wars we lost against them
> in that a single word can mean 17 different things based on the context you use it in
That happens in every langauge tho
Over 20°C. Though I might as well wear a jacket if it's under 25°C. Over 25°C a t-shirt becomes the go to
It depends on activity and other conditions (higher if raining, very humid, windy, etc), but as a very rough estimate I would say 10 to 15 ºC.
25 C for me, and i would be wearing a jacket or similar above the shirt cus the mornings in madrid are very cold at least for me, but i have bad circulation and my hands and feet are always cold even in the summer so maybe thats why i can take hot temperatures without melting and become an ice cream just by i slightly colder morning, because im a reptilian with the coldest blood
If sunny and not windy, even 10ºC is enough
If not sunny and windy, at least 20ºC, or maybe more
Yeah about that
at 40°C do you melt
Absolutely
I'm from Galicia and in my city the average temperature during summer is about 15º to 25ªC... If it gets to 30º or above I feel like I'm in hell, honestly (unless there's some nice breeze to compensate it)
I'm not exaggerating when I say that when I went to Ontario during summer I felt like I was melting
Yeah, IN CANADA, I wasn't freezing, I was melting xd
The temperatures weren't even than high (usually topped at 30ºC on the hottest days), but man, they got no wind
It was absolutely terrible
>Yeah, IN CANADA, I wasn't freezing, I was melting xd
Well, when I was in Alaska I once went out with a t-shirt
Fairbanks 32°C. It gets crazy hot up there
>Guess it's all scales and what we're used to but I would be pretty uncomfortable
High humidity really messes up with the way our body cools, so it's always going to feel hotter
However many people say they can't breathe in Madrid
our climate is too dry for them
So what we're used to plays a very important role ;)
Omg, this is so true and made me remember one of my worst experecines regarding heat EVER
We were on a road trip by bus, coming from Montreal back to Ontario
It was about 8 hours
Our bus had AC, so not so terrible
Until the bus stopped working
It started beeping, and the AC ceased to function
Then the bus slowed down, until it was going so slow that the driver had to stop on the side of the highway
Somehow they managed to make it work again, after a lot of stalling,  and we got alive to the nearest resting place (you know those restaurants in the middle of the road and stuff)
Well, we had to change buses
The one they brought had the seatings lined with a very warm, winter-like fabric
And no AC
Needless to say we all experience 5 of the worst hours of our lives
A girl even had a heat stroke and an ambulance had to bring her back home
People barely talked cause it felt like such a waste of energy and oxygen
Overall: a terrible experience
1/10, would not recommend
At least I'm glad I was in good company in the bus (friends and a girl I was dating), cause if it was just me and some strangers I don't know how much worse it could have been
You know, when you feel like you want to die I imagine it's better to be surrounded by your loved ones and stuff lol
Hell yeah, cabriolets are so nice during summer
We no longer have a dictator buried with honors in a monument
Hell yeah
Instead of spanish, i'll mention galician heroes (because i can)
Breogán: celtic hero that probably didn't exist, basically our Arthur or Cu Chulainn
María Pita: a woman who fought against the british during the XVI century
Rosalía de Castro: the poet who almost singlehandedly resurrected galician literature
Special mention: Franco, a huge piece of shit but i guess some people see him as a hero
May he rest in piss
The Catholic Kings (Fernando and Isabela) United the two biggest kingdoms of the peninsula into one and eliminated the last Muslim stronghold in Granada
They also supported Cristóbal Colon who ended up "discovering" America
Hernan Cortes:  he is the first name pops on people's minds when they think about the Conquistadores
Half warrior half explorer, he obliterated the Aztecs civilisation with only a handful of soldiers
Clearly not a national hero but probably person of interest
The chairmaker: he represents the valencian people who rose up on rebellion against Napoleon
A man who left his job building chairs and joined the resistance
Jaume I: as a kid he was sent to the South of France as politics were quite bad in Aragon
He was trained by the templar knights and took control of his kingdom from the plotting vassals
He launched a series of campaigns against the Muslims that culminated with the fall of València
He is well known for his biography and for launching Aragon into the list of European great powers
Iniesta
This is probably very political to say, but
Francisco Franco
Prior to World War II Spanish government was in the middle of turning to communism as from the USSR, so Italy and Hitler helped Franco conquer Spain from the communist government
Then Franco kept good relations with Hitler so they wouldn’t conquer Portugal, and also stayed good with him in World War II so they wouldn’t conquer Spain itself as well
If it wasn’t for Franco, Spain would’ve been conquered by Hitler and Portugal as well
and people here are not Aryan so I do not know what would’ve happened
Also, spain was not neutral in World War II, they helped a lot on the eastern front against Russia (that’s it)
My Great grandfather himself was rammed off a cliff on his bike by a Soviet Truck after coming back from work for thinking he was with Franco
María Pita fought against the English during the attack of Drake's Armada following the defeat of the Spanish Armada
You're mixing her with Manuela Malasaña, a girl from Madrid who died fighting alongside his father against the French in the 2 May uprising that began the Peninsular War
She's also a national heroe and her neighbourhood is now named after her (Malasaña)
What about the Moroccans that fought for Spain
History is a slut
Fuck
Actually i mixed her up with Agustina of Aragón.
Yes, but he was a spanish nationalist and suppressed our language
Exactly, some people have Hitler as their hero
That's what i meant
When
If you mean the ones who fought under Franco no
They are not heroes
Ohh my neighbor hello
About the first part I think you may be mistaken, Franco wanted to protect Portugal from Hitler as Franco did not at all agree with what Hitler was doing
but if he declares so publicly Hitler would know and try to conquer Spain, which was suffering and couldn’t do much as they just started recovering from the civil war
As for the non aggression pact, that’s true
But Franco’s Main reasoning for protecting Portugal was because:
-Ports everywhere leads Hitler to have greater naval power
-and surrounding Spain
They could so easily just take spain as well
Also a thing to note was how Franco got Hitler to not talk to Franco
Franco, being Hitler’s Allie was forced to help Hitler, so Franco arrived late to one of the meetings for plans and didn’t say anything for hours while Hitler ranted, then just said something like “okay, I’m going to help you against russia” then sent one division and from what I’ve heard relayed most of that information for Hitler’s plans to Churchill - apparently
As for the Carnation revolution that’s true, but Franco was too old by then so eh, not like he could’ve done anything about it anyways
Ajaja you may need to reform your library for a bit
He was a general in Morocco, fighting against some moors and recruiting others
I don't know if that counts
What
Why
I'm not sure what you already know
But clearly to me you are pointed at what you learned in papers that were assigned to you to know
To say that they weren't heroes
It a shame
That why I don't know where to start
In fact you stated that they were UNDER Franco which is very true
They were betrayed just like your granddads
What are you talking about
The moors who fought for Franco are criminals, traitors and fascists
Please, explain me why are they heroes
Who the fuck at they to you
The moors
do you refer to converted Spanish or the Berbers
You're fucked up
All the muslim minorities that fought under Franco, i was taught that they were moors
Sorry if my wording was offensive or not exact
Feel free to correct me
The Moors Los moriscos son españoles que se convirtieron al islam y fueron kicked de España a l norte de Marruecos
Hasta hoy siguen ahí. Los nativos del norte que son berbers,no tienen nada que ver con los árabes
Franco betrayer them all
Moriscos and moor are different
I meant "moros",which is a (i think) catch-all term for all muslim ethnics
Sorry if my wording was unfortunate,i didn't mean the moriscos
That the term .but its wrong
Moro is a racist term after the Moroccans in whole whether Muslims or not
My grandfather fought the Spanish civil war, on both sides
He was doing the military service in Madrid when the war started, so he fought in the battle of Madrid on the Republic side
Then on a leave he went to his village to see his parents and found they have been killed by communists for the crime of owning a few acres of land to the anthem of "the land for those that work it
" (ignoring the fact that this land have always been worked by him and his parents and sisters)
So instead of returning to Madrid, he went directly south and joined the nationals
With them he fought the Battle of the Ebro
After the war, the nationals found his records on the republican army and tagged him suspect and put him on a concentration camp
There he could see every night some inmates would be woken up to a "paseillo" ("little walk") to get shot
An officer that fought with him got him out of the camp, but he got a chronic pneumomia that made the rest of his life pretty miserable
He died in the 80s at the age of 64 years and never spoke of the war, what we know is from my grandmother and other sources
My uncle was a police chief for a medium sized town around Madrid during the dictadure
He gave explicit orders to his men to pursue only real criminals and not people for political stuff
For a time I thought it was an ass-saving lie until on some elections in the 90s (he was running for town major for the PP, moderate right wing, which he won) I saw a very old man, a delegate of the Communist Party give him a hug and he told me that my uncle saved his life during the dictadure
I was born in South Africa
My maternal grandfather was part of the military contingent that bombarded the [Rand Rebellion ] He was following orders but never forgave himself
My grandma's brother was mistakenly arrested by Civil Guards at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War (prior to it he had been an apolitical farmer who participated in an Agrarist association) and was sent to San Simón island, a Galician island that hosted an old hospital which was reconverted into a prisoner camp by the Nationals
There he spent two years before being trasladed to another prison in the Basque Country and spent another year before the Francoists realized their error and set him free
He then fled to France, took a boat to Venezuela and sweared to God that he wouldn't return until the dictatorship's end
The term you’re after is conscripted
> The imperial war museum have the original copy of a porn he wrote whilst in the tenches of the Somme
Porn
Nice
I was a South African conscript and sent to Angola during the bush war
I'm 20 and my grandpa fought in the Spanish Civil War, which happened just before WW2
True :)
None
BUT, actually
The last emperor of the eastern roman empire actually left on his will the title of emperor to the crown of Spain
So I guess there's something lawful there hahahaha
Don't quote me on this, but yes constantine (the XIth
) Or like his son or grsndson or something like that
I think he sold it
It's one of those cool old european things hahaha
The king of spain is also the king of jerusalem
Dunb stuff like that are my fav things about europe haha
Actually, we did in the Americas the same as the Romans did in Hispania: culture substitution
Legally speaking, it is binded to the kingdom of spain
Jus like the crown of jerusalem (spanish too)
I mean it makes no sense but legally speaking
hahaha
Nope, it was given by a pope (inocent III ?) To the king of aragon with the hope that he'd try to conquer jerusalem
The titles are of the crown, not off the kings
They can't change hands like that
Specially the historic useless ones
[this video] (min 23:29) explains the spanish position on this
before that it also explores the other claims
Walking
Understanding that your political/religious/social values are cultural, and that it might be different elsewhere
Everyone is guilty of ethnocentrism, but I find American on Reddit the biggest culprit
This is a generalisation
Urban areas made with common sense
Football
Yes, that's how it's called
That is our European culture
A cafe bar is very important in every corner
From breakfast to dinner and booze anything you can get from a cafe bar in Europe
Not in Spain
And judging by how much they love fast food, they would love kebabs, I'm in love with that turkish delish
Some hybrids do now
When you see a hybrid marketed as electric with range extender, that's what they mean
Smoking = Tuxedo
Lifting = Face lift
Parking = car park
Autostop = Hitchhiking
Footing = Jogging
Meeting = party conference / political convention
Smoking (Although adapted as "esmoquin") and autostop are also used here
Along with the typical Spanish example, we use "footing" for "jogging".
A tuxedo is a night suit
A smoking jacket (were our smoking comes from) is something fancy men used to wear over their suit while smoking so the smell didn't stick to their clothes
Yes, it is common to write it that way
Meeting is pronounced mitin in Spanish anyway
well, they are used differently than in native English countries
For example if you say "I have a meeting" in English, you probably will not go to a political party conference
VOX (far-right party)
That it changes every few years, stays useless and just creates confusion with each change
Well one thing that (unfortunately) doesn’t change is the emphasis on rote memorization :(
You mean the law
Yeah that's the worst
My brother and I are less than 3 years apart and our educations laws are different
Oof, so true -_-
A few years ago i fell in love with frog legs, french style
Makes me wish frog meat was more predominantly used in the rest of the world
Frogs are eaten in Spain too
Segovia, Extremadura, etc
I don't know because since we don't have a single flag that has no connotations I just can't make a comparison
Wow
Knew nothing about that
And thanks for the note, the appearance is too similar though
I guess it is because Austria’s history is a bit forgotten between the fall of Austria-Hungary and Germany’s annexation, right
All the Spanish flags leaves a sour taste to a lot of people, including the actual flag
In Spain all flags are political and polemic, usually people wearing or having the Spanish flag (the actual country flag) are branded as right-wing nationalist, a lot of left-wing people prefers the 2nd Republic Flag and then we have all the independentists flags of Catalonia, Euskadi, etc
The thing is, Spains flags are all the same (basically) with the exception of second republic (red, yellow, purple) between flags, the only thing that changed was the shield, except for Francos flag, that used an eagle instead of a shield
I would say that Francos is defeneteley the most controversial because dictatorship
Wow, I’m definitely searching for that right now
I guess general history knowledge is based on what affects one’s country (at least what is taught in schools) so it is pretty hard to know all of it
But at least it should get mentioned more often, though
Like the Spanish civil war; it is a conflict that only affected Spain but it is at least known by some people on a superficial level outside Spain
Honestly i dont know and i really dont care what that family does, they have no power
Also its possible that they only waved the flag as a sign of protest that specific time
It really doesnt matter, at least to me
I definitely have to check that out
Austria, in my opinion, is one of the countries in Europe with the most interesting histories, but I knew about the 1800, the most known times of the empire
I think the colors combine OK-ish but can’t avoid associating it with WWI
I guess that is why you said it looks cold and unfriendly, right
Or was it because of the colors themselves
Oh I see
I think now I searched it again with your comment in mind I agree with you
White-black is pretty bad and adding the red makes it even worse
The thing is that it looks like a dark version of the current Netherland’s flag (a standard tricolor with white), which I think makes it look a bit friendlier at first glance, idk
Broken telephone: everyone sits forming a circle
One person creates a message and whispers it in the ear of the person next to them, and that person does the same until the circle is complete
Then the last person says out loud what they heard and the person who started says the original message
The objective is to change the message as little as possible
Dizzy duck: a group of people form a circle and pass a ball between them while one person (the duck) is in the middle tries to intercept it
If the duck gets the ball, the last person who touched it becomes the new duck
The "making laugh game": one person is standing while the rest of the group is sitting
The person standing has to make the others laugh and if they succeed they sit down and the person who laughed is the new comedian
Cops and thieves: like hide and seek but there's a large amount of people who have to seek
At the beginning of the game it's decided by random who is a cop and who is a thief (we said "watermelon, watermelon, you'll be a great cop" and "melon, melon, you'll be a great thief", which rhymes in Spanish) Also, if a thief gets caught, they're transported to the "jail zone" and can be rescued by another one if they manage to get there (which is risky since there's normally a cop there)
English hide and seek: it has nothing to do with hide and seek
It's required to have a lot of space, we used to play in a pavilion
One person, who I'll be refering as "player1" is at one side of the pavilion and the rest of the players at the opposite one
Player1 turns around and says "one two three, the English hide and seek, without moving your hands or feet" (in Spanish it rhymes too) and then looks at the players
While player1 is counting, the players move forward, but when player1 looks at them, the players have to remain still because if they move, player1 can send them back
When eventually one of the players gets to where player1 is, they have to touch the wall and scream "chorizo" (no real reason for this other than an alert for the other players)
Then, player1 has to start running and if they catch another player, this player is the new player1 in the next game
Grandma: similar to English hide and seek but player1 is constantly looking at the other players and to move forward they have to guess what food player1 likes
By turns, all the players say food names and player1 decides how many steps they take based on how much they like this food
The rest of the rules are just like English hide and seek
Same in spain
Hahaha, oh, poor you
English hide and seek, where I come from we call it el pollito inglés
En Galicia lo conocí siempre como el escondite inglés jajaja
I normally say something like 'why should I do that, you won't understand me' (in the language of course), but I dislike the question anyway
I like to make it a sport of saying the most obscene things while smiling, so nobody realises all the gay sexual shit I say I wanna do to them
Like: "Ik Rafael, zou je lekker hard in je kontje nemen en alle hoeken van de kamer laten zien
When they ask what it means, I simply say it means something like "Hi, I'm Rafael and I'm 30 years old
-Si Jo te parle en valenciá tu pots entendre el que te estic dient
(if I speak with you in valencian can you understand what I am saying
They get very confused
It sounds like Spanish but  they can't understand anything
No, and its really awkward
I just say the first lines of El Quijote
"Que más te da lo que diga, si no me vas a entender" ("it doesn't matter what I say, you're not going to understand it anyway")
Neuken in de keuken, its an easy pick up line for when you come to the netherlands
What does that even mean
So I found this gem while looking for its pronunciation:
It seems to be pronounced like the Spanish 'j'. Just learned Spanish is a choking hazard apparently
Oh, that reminds me of a Spanish one: "Tres tristes tigres comían trigo en un trigal
Un tigre, dos tigres, tres tigres
" If you say it really fast you always end up saying "trigres" instead of "tigres" (tigers)
I tend to just say "Qué coño quieres que diga".
Good video indeed, thanks
Spain used to go to war with anyone when it was an empire, but I think we're in good terms with most of our neighbours now
Some people dislike France, some people idolise it
We like Portugal, but it's sometimes considered to be tiny and less important than Spain
We usually fancy Italy, and I'd say they love us back, which is probably the main reason why covid fucked us up
There is one country Spain absolutely hates in this world: Spain
Fix: no fix possible, prepare for civil war
You forgot the issue about Gibraltar
It's a useless grudge but there it is
Most of the people have no problems with it it being British, but because the government has, it is a tax haven
A lot of us here also wish for a federal republic
Left alone or left in the EU
Food or football
Portugal is a place you can get by car easily from Spain, so normally people have great memories of doing short weekend trips to small lovely towns there, or just visiting cities for holidays
I swear everyone I know who has been there talks have nice words for Portugal
and I wish I could say the same about our other neighbours, France
Oh, I like Portugal a lot and I think I even have Portuguese blood on my bloodline
I was just trying to reflect the thoughts of Spanish people in general
It's usually the nationalists that think stuff like that
Actually is our fault: if Spain doesn't recognise Gibraltar as part of UK, it is hard to request data from companies or accounts there and obtain any information
I don't get it
Ceuta y Melilla were Spanish before Morocco existed and they aren't colonies
They are fully Spanish cities with no special clauses
But apart of that, yes, it is pure stubborness and rancid nationalism
The point was that being from Ceuta is the same that being from Madrid
Indian people had no UK passport or the same rights
The only thing special about those territories is they are not part of the iberian peninsula, as Canarias or Baleares
Were they allowed to vote for the UK prime minister/ government ?
[Parchís] is probably the most played
Dominoes is also popular, and there's tons of card games
This looks very similar (and I assume has the same name) as [Juego de la Oca] (The Goose Game) which is a Spanish Classic
edit: found a [wikipedia article] about it
Yo lo domino
La Oca bro
Tiro porque me toca
For Spain i'd arque people know (in order): Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Bilbao, Granada, Santiago de compostela, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, Corduba, Palma
, San Sebastián, Málaga
and then most would start blabbering if they hadn't a long time ago
That leaves Zaragoza over 900
000 inhabitants and Murcia with over 400
000 inhabitants
In the 300
000 there are places like Valladolid and Vigo i bet not even a tenth of foreigners has Heard about
Finally under the 300
000 Mark we start seeing things like Móstoles or jerez de la frontera which i bet are completely unknown outside Spain
Edit: Let me know which cities you know from Spain
Murcia too, seventh largest in Spain but i doubt foreigners know about it
I was going to say this
Valencia is also generally unknown outside of Europe
Look you can stop with the charade
We all know Bielefeld isn’t real
The lonely Planet guide name is: Budapest and Hungary
They're pretty well known, at least for a european audience
>Padua
From the university
>Taranto
From the Roman province
>Messina
I think i've Heard about It
>Prato
Ok, i have no idea where this is
Yeah, i think Russia wins the price in this category, we know Next to nothing of your cities
>Bydgoszcz
I've been to Poland an it's the first time i Hear about it
>Leicester
The football club
>Coventry
Heard about It
>Norwich
Heard about but would really struggle to place It
>Lincoln
Don't know It at all
>Hull
this one's made Up
Isn't It
>Sunderland
Don't think i've Heard about It
>Aberdeen
Yeah, i know this one, though i don't know why
>Inverness
Yeah, i think it's a bit touristy
>Dundee
Yeah, i think it has the worst drug problem in scotland
>I’d be impressed with any foreigners who know more Welsh places than Cardiff and Swansea
You do well, i don't know any
>Derry/Londonderry
Yeah, but it's cheating, i lived a year in Ireland
I had to learn about It
I confirm, i didn't know neither
The foreigners don’t know it and the Spanish try to forget it
Let's go a bit down the list then
Do you know Murcia
Even Santander is more well known than Zaragoza, though perhaps only because of the bank
Sure, by Europeans
* Catalan: Imperi austrohongarès / Àustria-Hongria
* Spanish: Imperio austrohúngaro / Austria-Hungría
Imperio Austro-Húngaro, pretty lame but when you learn about it DAMN is it powerful
Imperio austrohúngaro
We Spanish hate each other more than we hate anybody else
Some people are never on time and have a "pass the bucket" mentality
That we don’t like to work
I mean, not everyone does of course, but sadly more and more teens are refusing to find jobs and just live with their parents’ money
We are not really proud of our country
and that's too bad because I really think that Spain is amazing
Can confirm
I am Spanish and I hate myself
[Damn Spaniards, they ruined Spain
^^That ^^surely ^^applies ^^to ^^every ^^country ^^tho
Did anyone say Spain lol
As a Spanish, I relate
People from northern countries just can't understand what it's like to try to focus at work at over 35° for months
Specially since you can't sleep during summer nights
To be fair, tea is fucking delicious
I don't drink as much as I'd like because I have some mild blood pressure issues and I'm afraid to much tea could worsen them
85% of the world's population would like to be as "poor" as Portugal is
We should put things into perspective
There are many different factors tbh, but it's something historical
No country has been in war against Spain more than Spain itself, and that if you only count our proper civil wars
Before Spain was created, you still had different kingdoms constantly fighting each other, and having their own civil wars as well (Catalan civil war, Navarre civil war, two more civil wars in Castile
Nowadays the problematic regions are mostly Basque country and Catalonia
Terrorism just finished a few years ago in the Basque country, and the roots of that conflict go back to the Civil War, where Franco barely made a genocide against Basques, supported by nazi Germany
Many Basques, catalans, and some Galicians don't consider themselves Spanish at all
Then, even among "proper" Spanish regions, many people just feel an absolute hate against our country, mostly due to our past and our current political situation
We are really critical with ourselves
I think all European countries that have developed a lot relatively recently like Spain, Portugal, Poland, etc
share this feeling
Like, there's this feeling tht we're nearly as good as our neighbors but not quite yet, that we're a bit backwards, so people tend to assume that we're worse than other countries in many topics even if it's not true
And this is something that tends to happen to people of all ideologies
Praise, brother
What are you doing here .
Yeah we usually think the same way about you
I normally just imagine Scandinavians or Russians doing normal life in winter as if extreme cold and darkness can't affect you just because you were born there
Well I can talk for Spain, here you would find AC in stores, supermarkets, public transport
but then it's not common in daily life
It's too expensive for working class to have it at home, and you'll only have it at work if you're lucky
Also it's normally used with certain consideration, so you don't really get cold
Not really
A lot of changes don't actually require touching the Constitution, they can be done by changing one Organic Law or the other
For example, the approval of gay marriage did not require a constitutional reform, it was just done with a modification to the Civil Code
I was centered on the "alarmingly low". It is not really alarming, knowing that major changes can be produced without even touching the constitution, just by twitching organic laws
The Constitution just gives some broad strokes that are developed via organic laws, like the Organic Law on the Electoral Regime, the Organic Law on the Judiciary Power, the Organic Law on the Constitutional Court, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, or even the Organic Law on Ordinary Administrative Procedure
Esquío in Galician (es'ki o)
Ardilla in Spanish (ar 'dee yuh)
AFAIK they are able to pronounce it, aside from typical problems like rolled r.
Squirrel in Spanish is "Ardilla", and came from "Harda", word in a pre-roman language of Hispania
In Asturian it is said esguil from which comes the verb esguilar which means to climb but is also similar to esguila which means quisquilla, a type of shrimp
That hasn't been my experience
Not recognising Kosovo's independence
Not recognising the Armenian genocide
Not recognising Palestine as a sovereign country
I don't get how exactly are we supposed to support the two-state solution without recognising one of the states
Keeping the claim over Gibraltar
Selling weapons to countries with rampant human rights violations
Same here :(
Don’t forget about Western Sahara, that’s still embarrassing
And Kosovo, I don’t agree, it’s like enough  Portuguese come to a corner of Spain and then they declare that corner is not Spain anymore
The international community was too eager to recognize Kosovo without any right just to annoy Serbia
'Ratas' means 'rats' in spanish lol
How weird I haven't seen any news about that apart from what that website says
No, it's just that it hasn't been discussed in congress
It'd most likely be recognised if it was brought up
Catalonia, Basques*
And even if I was against free self-determination of those peoples, I don't think it's the same case
Kosovo declared independence to flee from a government that oppressed them because of their ethnicity
In cases like that one or like colonies, the UN recognises the right for a territory to self determination regardless of what the central government says
It's the same thing with South Sudan, country whose independence we recognised
I guess our politicians think it's different just because it's Europe and a) it gives the impression that in peaceful civilised Europe tht things can happen as well and/or b) very few people would notice about the recognition of a new African country as opposed to an European one
We're military allies with the UK and we don't really need it because we already have control of the strait with Algeciras and Tarifa in the peninsula and Ceuta on the other side
We don't have a practical need for it
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Gibraltar don't want to be part of Spain and it's an issue that sours relations with one of our allies and (at least until Brexit) one of our major trading partners
In my opinion there should be a treaty to settle the issues regarding waters, frontier controls and tobacco trafficking and that's it
Maybe we should keep tht should Gibraltar stop being a British dominion there should be an option to have it join Spain as n autonomous city and that's about it
Although I do think it's more likely that it becomes a city-state
Kosovo yes
The others not really
We don't recognise Palestine because the US doesn't (and neither does your country btw) and we don't recognise the Armenian genocide because it hasn't been discussed
On the other hand, we have recognised South Sudan's independence
I'm fucking done with this planet
Yeah, basically
But what is your solution
That's why I say that there re issues tht need to be settled, issues which we're not going to solve by claiming Gibraltar
Yeah but for it to be a normal UN member state it first needed to be recognised by basically everyone
I'd say no
In spain university admission works with two different marks: 60% the last year of education + 40% a set of exams when the school is finnished and only if the kid has graduated
In serious schools, the school's exams ared courses are muuuuch harder than the state's exam so kids wuth a decent average pass those tests without any problems at all
Extra classes are something that students that struggle pay for but no
It is not usual for kids to really prepare the state tests in academies if they are the smart ones
It's not about harder exams
It's a out higher requirements in daily work
From the get go you know that the school you are doing bachillerato in (that's how the last 2 years of education are called) is difficult (or not)
Over the year you have plenty of oportunities to get your grades up and the hard work means that most certainly you are going to get a better average markin your state's exam (selectividad) than in school
Also, if you are a good student it's not weird that you get your marks up by the end just because of your hard work ( i was terrible in soanish with my teacher and tgen i got a fucking 8/10 in selectividad)
On the other hand you have the schools that are based on passing the state's exam
They inflate your school's marks a lot but tbh all mu friends that went there ended up getting reaaaally mediocre marks in the state's exam
So no, school is not only about exams, daily work counts a lot too
They mske yiu work harder but that doesn't means everything is super hard or that exams are impossible
They are just more on your back about studying and doing more homework and more papers and more about everything
Public schools just don't value daily work as much
If i remember correctly i had lile even a 40% of daily work in many subjects just with the harder homework amd such
Theu dont make super hard exams, rhey just make yoy work harder, making studying for the state exams a cake walk
They are not refrigerated at the store but we put them in the fridge after we buy them
I know some people who keep them out, however
In Spain fridge is the norm
In the UK I see sometimes my friends storaging them at room temperature but I always put them in the fridge at home
Here eggs are sold off a non-refrigerated shelf
But everyone I know puts them in the fridge
Here in Spain everybody put their eggs in the fridge
You won't be able to shell a fridge without one of those specialized egg shelves
If the spanish omelette has to have onion or not
Tortilla with onions or without it
The Flag
it has been [the same flag since 1785] but people have decided that its the flag of fascism, since Francoist spain used it
If only the 2nd republic didnt modify the flag
the 1st republic used pretty much the exact same flag
Another national symbol that changed its meaning due to Francoism was the [Eagle of Saint John] wich was over 3 centuries old but now is considered a symbol of Franco
&#x200B;
Nowadays you might get called a fascist if you wave the spanish flag, depending on the region and the situation
The far left and the independentists preffer the Republican Flag (purple band)

There are different ways to say traditional-first-meal-of-the-day

I'd say there's one for every stereotypical karaoke assistant:
- Single/divorced man in his forties looking for his lost youth:
- [Fito y Fitipaldis - La casa por el tejado]
- [Celtas cortos - 20 de abril]
- [Duncan Dhu - 100 gaviotas]
- Young couple of lovers:
- [Carlos Baute and Marta Sanchez - Colgando en tus manos]
- [Alex Ubago and Amaia Montero - Me muero por conocerte]
- Old couple of lovers
- [Pimpinela- Cierra la puerta]
- Old romantic man who thinks he can sing
- [José Luis Perales - un velero llamado libertad]
- [Nino Bravo - un beso y una flor]
- Drunk group of teenagers that would
never be in a karaoke if they weren't completely wasted;
- [El arrebato - Himno del Sevilla C.F.]
But I knew it as Dragostea din tei :(
We have a very famous parody about coming out called [Pluma Pluma Gay] Who's the gay
), I share it with English subtitles
I'm sure it was also sung in karaokes back in the days
Also Amaral - Marta, Sebas, Guille y los demás*
Edit: the real name of the song
There's a 100% chance of La canción del Mariachi, from Antonio Banderas:
Mi gran noche is also a classic
Also Fiesta Pagana forma young people
When I lived in Madrid I drove or use train to go anywhere within the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal and Andorra)
For the rest of Europe I have always use the plane
For me the line is on 3-4 hours by train distance
I live in the North of Spain and to go to Madrid I can choose:
-3 Hours by train from city center to city center
-4 Hours by car, sometimes more depending on the traffic
-40 mins flight, but I have to add the time of transport to the departure airport (20 mins), passing the control (1,5 hours) and moving from Barajas to the city center (30 mins)
At the end of the day if the price is ok I prefer to go by train much more, easier and more calm
I used to fly every time I wanted to go to a different European country because train trips take much longer and are more expensive than a plane one, even to our closest neighbours
However, the pandemic has made me more fearful and wary of air travel so I might do things differently once I'm allowed and can afford to leave Spain again
I’m from Alicante and if I go to Barcelona I’ll go by air
Intra-iberian travel by train, car or bus
Outside of that, plane
I know Galicians that will take flights when going to Madrid or further south, though
Especially people from A Coruña. It's really remote
My family did drive up to Frankfurt with many stop-overs once, and we did take the night train to Paris once, but that was for the experience
It was really fun btw
I'm pretty sure there's some rail sizing differences between Spain and the rest of Europe so you gotta switch trains in Barcelona when going Europe-wards anyways (at least that's where the night train to Paris was departing), so that takes a bit of the incentive out of it
When I travel Europe again I hope to do it by train
Not even to Brussels or Dusseldorf
(just as examples)
Depends on the number of passengers and the type of car you're driving
I found [this pdf] comparing different types of transportation (gCO2/kilometer/passenger) if you want to check it out
Had a feeling that that was your reason hehe
Interesitng, although I found the consumption rates of those cars and their contamination super high
My Peugueot 208 for example manages to do waaaaay better than those
Although that may be because it is dated 2008 and we have gone a super long way from there in terms on car efficiency
Oh damn I didn't notice that it's that old
But yeah, even an old, small car is better than a plane, even if you're travelling alone
Every time someone refers to a country as "Socialist" and it's not the USSR, Cuba or North Korea, you can probably close the video/article/web page
It's such a lazy shortcut
I understand it might make sense to a US audience, but outside of the US media bubble it's meaningless
[From the CIA World Factbook] "Sweden’s small, open, and competitive economy has been thriving and  Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living with its combination  of free-market capitalism and extensive welfare benefits
All EU countries have a mix of free market, regulations, state intervention, low-to-high taxes and some level of welfare
Also, it's also really funny to me how the US is obsessed with the same 3 countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark), and rarely mention Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal
The entirety of Spain is Andalucía and the only food is paella
This is not México
It's not the same
These are two completely separate countries
99% of American films
Somehow, in Spanish dubbing, you have the same accent as Germans
Lovers of the arctic circle, Spanish movie by Julio Medem
To add a little bit to this:
-flamenco is the traditional dance of only one of the 17 regions
In most of the country flamenco is almost as foreign as the Norwegian language
-bullfighting: we don't spend our days seeing that shit
In fact, it's a dying tradition that might soon disappear
-siesta: again, its popularity is hugely overstated
It made sense back when most people were farmers and had to stop working in the afternoon because it was too hot (that's exactly where the name comes from), but nowadays, with AC and a faster, more comfortable life, as the meme says, ain't nobody got time for that
-paella: believe it or not, we don't eat that every day
-relugion: I'm tired of Spanish people being portrayed as Catholic fanatics
In fact, our country has lost its faith faster than any other country in Europe (only after Belgium, I think)
After several years in Germany, Deutschland is definitely waaay more religious, in some cases to a medieval degree that would never be allowed in Spain (Tanzverbot
What the ultrafuck is that
-related to this, the inquisition
Sure, it was bad and somehow it lasted until the early 19 century, but compared to the shit that happened north of the Pyrenees, it was a joke
Take a look at the number of "witches", Jews or random people killed in Germany, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands or even Sweden
They're just trying to cover it so tourism doesn't low
Kung fu films in Macau confirm
> Why the hell would you not
Every variation of it I had was delicious
In many part of the country, we do eat "rice with stuff" (Valencians will get upset if you call it paella) very often
It's tradition in my area, in Eastern Andalusia, to have paella on sundays
Not everyone, not all sundays, but it's definitely a common meal in many areas of the country
I think the US only had the Salem trials, no
Businesses usually close at 2PM for a couple of hours because it's lunchtime and when other people go back home from early morning shifts, so it is not worth to be open during that time
nothing to do with siesta
That's not necessarily because of the siesta
There is still the idea that people should eat at home with their families, and not at work
People (and the government) are increasingly against it: taking two hours in the afternoon to go home, cook and eat means that we leave work two hours later, which means that other evening activities are delayed too, which might not be sometimes very healthy (it doesn't help that most of the country is pretty warm during large part of the year, that our time zone is wrong, that our days during winter and autumn are longer thanks to being in the south
More and more people prefer to eat a salad in 15 minutes at the office and then get out sooner so that they have more time for sport, the kids, reddit or any other hobby
In other words, be more like the rest of Europe
Yeah, "siesta" is literally the Spanish word for "nap". Having an awful work schedule is not siesta
Yes, I loved riding my bike when I was little
One of my favourite summer pastimes was to throw myself down slopes without holding the handlebars and feeling the coolest
That shit is in the Dad Guide
My dad did that to me and i ran into a lamp post
You should exercise even if you're thin
Exercise is good for you for way more things than your weight or body fat and you could be unhealthy even if you're thin
Don't get me wrong, I don't exercise either because of lack of free time, but I should do it
Everyone should
16th and 17th spanish tercios
The French are *franchutes* or *gabachos,* the Portuguese are *lusos*, and Northern tourists, especially from the British isles, Germany, etc
are *guiris*.
No, we only have offensive ones (that doesn't mean we hate our neighbors)
Sorry to dissapoint you bro
As for the (kind of) offensive (for someone and just funny for others) nouns, where I'm from:
Franchute / gabacho (it doesn't translate to anything) for frenchmen
Piratas (pirates) for Englishmen, because a lot of the pirates that stole gold from spanish ships that came to Spain from America were from England
Cabeza cuadrada (square head) for Germans (not because of the form of the head but because they want things done one way and they don't usually improvise, or that does the steriotype say)
Spaguetti for italians
Moro (moor) for Morocans (or any northern african or middle eastern)
Panchito (no translation) for latin americans
Yankees for americans (people from the USA)
We also have a lot of those "offensive" names for people from other provinces within Spain
We call fren people "Gabachos". Which apparently comes from Gavach,  an occipital word meaning "from Provenza" and which usually was synonym of stupid
The Frenchs Gabachos or Franchutes
The British pirates
The Britishs/Germans who are young and drunk in the beach "Carrots"
Whatever, swamp germans
This
In spain I think we only have this names for frenchies
USAmericans are not gabachos, that's French
Gringos o yanquis only
True
Everyone above France is a guiri
From the regional ones my favourite is godos (goths)
It is used in the Canary Islands for mainland Spaniards
Another offensive one: we call "vuelcafrutas" to the frenchmen, just because some time ago they overturned spanish trucks with fruits in what was some sort of protest
TIL
Well, sudaca ia truly offensive (in my opinion), thats why i didnt talk about it
I don't think I've ever herd gabacho about any country
Yeah, kind of, I mean, all the other nicknames I said you can use them jokingly of offensively, depending on the tone and context, but sudaca is offensive 100%
They gave more importance to the Spanish Civil War
First we're taught extensively about our Civil War and how it served as a prelude for WW2
Then we're mostly taught about the European theater: Axis ivasions and early victories, oppression during the occupation and the Holocaust, invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union joining the Allies and winning in the Eastern Front, the Normandy Landing and the defeat of Germany and Italy
Then we have a page of the Pacific theater and the atomic bomb
The invasion of China and Japanese war crimes, the African theatre, the role of smaller countries and colonies and even the role of Spain (except a paragraph about the Hendaye meeting between Franco and Hitler and the Blue Division) are all heavily downplayed
The 16th-17th century
American conquest, first global power and all that
The tercios etc
The ultranationalist party VOX used as slogan in their last campaign *La reconquista*, the period between years 700 and 1400 approx where the Christians recovered all the territory previously lost to the Muslims (you probably see the racist connection)
Other than that, all the nationalists like to remember the huge Spanish empire and wellness of what we called *the Golden century* (XVI century)
Reconquista
Proper nationalists would romanticise the Empire, people who are just far conservative more than patriotic would turn more to the Reconquista
The empire and the dictatorship
Well they actually are and still blaming us for the stolen gold
Anyways as the other comment says, nationalists are a real small minority in Spain
In Reconquista, most Muslims converted to Christianity (and the ones that didn't convert, moriscos, left to Africa)
A lot of people in Southern and Eastern Spain are descendants of converted Muslims
It was not specially genocidal
The Renconquista had nothing to do with the Empire, and I literally never heard about any genocide during that period, only Christian kings starting many different little wars against the moors for personal interests along centuries
In my opinion we can only talk about a proper "Reconquista" in the last period, with the Catholic Kings
The only poultry you can find in virtually every Spanish supermarket is chicken and turkey
In areas with a lot of hunting activity it is not unusual to find game like duck and partridge but even then it is not so common so eat them
These two birds in particular are often sold in the rest of the country already cooked and tinned as a delicatessen
Apart from that, duck is a staple of Asian restaurants but not as popular as chicken, beef and pork dishes
Not unheard of, but normally eaiting poultry means 99,9% is chicken
Maybe turket in processed food, but duck is more of a novelty than any other thing
Adding a bit more to this, perhaps not in every supermarket, but I’d say that duck, quail and partridge are not that difficult to find in cities
Even guineafowl is sometimes available
You won’t be able to find it in supermarkets, but some butchers and some of the larger supermarkets have them available sometimes
Goose is way more uncommon than in other European countries though
Pigeon is also seen as game
For Spain i would say [La Línea de la Concepción.]  A lot of drug traffic and marginal zones, but there are some very nice parts and a great view of Gibraltar
Edit: And also the many tourist towns ([Salou] [Magaluf] [Playa den Bossa] etc
) A lot of tourists messing around, drugs and alcohol
I'm starting to see a patern here
This question comes up roughly every month
For Spain i nominate Algeciras and Parla
For their soulless architecture and lack of historical buildings
Not ugly but fairly opressive, but that's a given considering the environment
One of the cities in Cowboy Bebop is heavily inspired by this city and it's great
We mainly joke about the andalusian accent, but also about the other 15 accents that you can find in Spain
When I lived in Madrid people from the city center, where I worked, would sometimes mock my Madrid's east-outskirts accent (ejjjjque)
Madrid has many accents for such a small province
I don't understand, what do you mean you don't spell the *c*?
Wait so any /k/ sound is replaced by an aspirated sound
So *cosa* is pronounced *'osa*?
That's really interesting
Such a big difference
Does if happen for every /k/ sound or there are rules
Ok that makes more sense
Although it says it's post vocalic rather than intervocalic
Can you think of a word in Italian like that
As a Spaniard it's fun to find out /θ/ is used in an Italian dialect
People have said that for a long time to justify the lack of government intervention in the economy to fight climate change
It doesn't seem to be working
At least not fast enough
And it's not like we have time to spare
Sure, some economic sectors are already starting to earn a lot of profits from renewables and recycling and electric vehicles and whatnot
But the car and fossil fuels corporations and lobbies are far more powerful
And why would they care about the future
They've been hoarding money for decades
Don't worry, they'll be unaffected by whatever happens in this next century because of our failure to take action on an issue we've known about for 60byears
With Spanish, just any time anybody switches b and v, ll and y or g and j since they sound exactly the same
Also, when people forget to use h, since it is completely silent
This one hurts me especially, it's just so hard to read when it happens
People that use "me se" instead of "se me" deserve a special place in hell
It's a lot more common in spoken Spanish, though
Well, ll and y shouldn't. No yeísmo ftw
If we think about it we know what's the correct one but for some reason we don't do it naturally
Because of this it's now officially accepted to say "le" instead of "lo" only to refer to people and other variations will probably end up being accepted as well
I spent half of my childhood spelling yendo as llendo
It was so embarrassing when I found out the truth
Is it officially accepted
Thought it was only recognized as being common in certain parts of the world/regions, but not actually proper/correct
*El motivo por (el) que

>En el Esbozo de una nueva gramática de la lengua española (RAE, 1973) se condena el leísmo referido a cosa, pero se permite el referido a persona masculina singular; el leísmo plural siempre ha sido censurado por la Academia, ya que su baja incidencia desde los textos castellanos más antiguos atestigua que tampoco lo ha sancionado nunca mayoritariamente el uso de los hablantes cultos

"Despicable me" is translated as "Gru: my favourite villain".
My favourite one is *Knight and Day* being translated as *Noche y Día* (***Night*** *and Day*)
Not a translation but Shaun of the Dead was called "Zombies Party" in Spain
A lot of light comedies get translations that have nothing to do with the original title so that they rhyme or sound catchy
A few others that latinos love
* Un Canguro Superduro (a super tough nanny)  -The Pacifier
* La Jungla de Cristal (The Glass Jungle) - Die Hard
* Tu a Londres y yo a California (You off to london and me to california) - The Parent Trap
* Dos Colgados Muy Fumados (two loonies very stoned) - Harold and Kumar go to White Castle
Theres one specially bad called ["Cole Cole Que Te como",] (run run im gonna eat you) mocking the supposed inability of chinese people to pronounce a hard R (Corre corre)
Originally  **We’re Going to Eat You, 1980**
In Spain "Despicable Me" was translated as "Gru, my favorite villain"
Also, "Hard to kill" is the same translation they made in Latin America
Better than "Glass Jungle".
latinos did the same thing with die hard, called it "Duro de matar" - Hard/Tough to kill
In Spanish it was simply "Forget me"

*Madre patria* is also Spain, Portugal

Normal here
I wouldn't say they are the norm here but they're fairly common
I have always had that type of windows in my house
They are normal to see here
Not universal here, specially for the big ones that also serve as doors but anyway they aren't rare either
If you renovate the windows you will probably put these
It is one of the things I miss since I moved to US, proper windows
And not only for the tilt-turn ones, but also for proper shutters installed on the outside
Those that can block the light completely, allowing you to sleep during the mornings
It might not look fancy in those all glass building, but damn they are practical
In Spain we have this guy "ride me five" he goes all around Africa, North to South on his motorbike
He's super natural, just records his experience and feelings
Whenever he has a mechanical problem he has to solve it on his own, cuz the African mechanics just don't fix his problems
Amazing
Alexelcapo for gaming videos, I really like his honesty and sense of humour

I love dogs and I love some cats too (the nice ones), but a lot of them are assholes
Spanish people tend to prefer dogs in general
No idea about the continent
They say dogs are man's best friend, but the cat will never tell the police where the drugs are
Hahaha this is confusing usually the "known" languages in Spain are Spanish, Catalan, Vasque and Galitian
Occitan normally is one of the lesser known laguanges, these 5 languages are official in their communities but there's also more, like asturleones, aragones or this weird whistling communication method of Canary Islands "silbo gomero" (not really a language but it's worth to check out)
You forgot a very important one: galician, spoken in Galicia and in some areas of León and Asturias
It is very similar to portuguese as they were the same language in the middle ages
Also, there are some other minor and non official languages such as asturiano/astur-leonés and aranogese
Also in Melilla many people speak cherja, a bereber language
In Spain there's also Aragonese, which is only spoken in the Northern mountains of Aragon, and Asturleonese, which is spoken mainly in Asturias (where it's protected and in the way of becoming co-official) and in a few some rural areas of the former region of Leon and in Extremadura
Both were slowly replaced by Castilian since the Late Middle Ages
Before, Asturleonese was spoken in all of the kingdom of León (except Galicia) and Aragonese was spoken in Southern Navarre, all of the kingdom of Aragon proper and the Western regions of the kingdom of Valencia
Those last two areas are nowadays the parts of Navarre and Valencia where Castilian/Spanish is the native language instead of Basque and Valencian Catalan
There's also Montañés or Cantabrian, spoken in Cantabria, which is debated whether is a dialect of Asturleonese, a transition between Asturleonese and Castilian or if nowadays we can consider it a dialect of Castilian because of the huge influence that language has had in the dialect
There are also two languages of ethnic minorities: Caló, the traditional language of the Romani in Spain (tho I've never heard it) and the Ladino, the language spoken by the Sephardic Jewish people
Ladino originally was a mixture of Castilian and Hebrew, kinda like Yiddish was a mixture if German and Hebrew, but nowadays has Arabic, Greek and Turkish influences due to the Sephardic diaspora after the expulsion
There are very few Sephardic Jews in Spain, tho, since very few Sephardic families decided to return after freedom of religion was established in the 19th century
It's way more common in Israel, Turkey, Morocco and Greece
But it's a language native to Spain so I think it should be considered
Galician in Spain
You missed that one :(
In Spain we have 4 official languages: Spanish Catalan, Basque, and Galician
The other languages aren't official
I like to call Galician the midpoint between Spanish and Portuguese, and Catalan the midpoint between Spanish and French, because they are pretty similar to both (for example, Galitians can understand perfectly the Portuguese and Portuguese can understand perfecto y Galitians)
Basque I'd a prerromanic language, so it doesn't have a lot to do with the other languages in Spain
In Spain we have from East to West:
-Catalan/Valencian/Mallorquin (basically the same language), Mediterranean Area
-Aranese (Occitan), spoken in the Vall d'Aran in the Pirinees
-Fabla, also in the Pirinees
-Basque, Preindoeuropean language
-Asturian/Leonés/Cántabro (again basically the same language), Cantabric Mountains
-Gallego, in the area just North of Portugal
All these languages developed due to the isolation during the moorish conquer and later Reconquista of the Peninsula in the middle ages
Edit: grammar
Not sure if they are considered a language, but I have seen there are entire articles written in Asturianu and Extremeñu in Wikipedia
(Asturian and Extremaduran)
I think they resemble more like a form of broken castillian
Also,remember minority non-oficcial languajes like aragonese,astur-leones,aranese,portugese(speaked in a border zone called olivenza) and silbo(a languaje wich consists of whistles in one of the islands of the canary islands)
and valencian is considered a separate language to the catalan,even tough two speakers(a catalan and a valencian) can hold a conversation without dificulties
Actually those are the languages that are recognised as co-official in some regions (and so more spoken), but there is also:
* [Aragonese] spoken in Aragón
* [Caló] spoken by the Spanish and Portuguese Romani
* [Riffian] and Arabic spoken in Ceuta and Mellilla
As a curiosity, in the Gomera island there is also a non-verbal language: the [Silbo Gomero] (composed by different whistles) used by the locals to comunicate up to a distance of 5km across the ravines and valleys of the island
Also Aragonés (very small in speakers) and Aranes
Yeah sure I wasn't criticizing,I just found it funny
Some years ago while I was flighing outside Spain I started talking with an Aussie tourist that was returning from a 2 weeks trip all over Spain (including Catalonia & Valencia), he discovered about the existence of the other spanish languages from me, while leaving the country, inside the plane
Sure, but OP currently mentioned it in the post
> and valencian is considered a separate language to the catalan
No philologist or academy has ever made such a claim, that's just some political bullshit
Yeah I know they exist (except silbo, it's the first time I hear about it xd), but the only one I heared in my life was Astur-leones, so I don't know a lot about them
Basically not, they are literally the same language, those are just local accents
[Vall d'Aran
Hes treating andalusian, canarian and castillian as if they were consider diferent languages when it's not, maybe spanish is distinct in those areas but is faaaaar faaar away from being a language on their own
Source: I'm a castillian living with a canarian roomate and i have spoken qith plenty of andalusians througth my life
I live in a rural town (20
000 people) and don't own a car
Sometimes I go with my friends on trips in their car, but everyday there's no need for one
There's a bus station less than 1 km away that can take me into a city that has a train station, so I can get to any major city using strictly the bus and trains
To go across town and to stores or the pharmacy I walk or take my bike
The town is basically a circle and I can cross it in 15 minutes biking
Yes, there are no buses with a schedule that works for me to go where I study, so from Monday to Friday, I have to go in car
Right now someone else that can drive has to take me there, but I want to get the driving license so I can go wherever, whenever I want without worrying about schedules or if there is a bus available
The public transportation here in Mallorca is not good enough
I *could* live without a car, but it would be significantly more inconvenient
I spend around 40 minutes daily going to and from univerity by car and it'd be close to 2 hours if I went by bus instead
That's a lot of time when you start adding up, and it's not like I have plenty of free time to spare
I use the car much less for personal reasons
However, there are no night buses in my town, and I pretty far at the outskirts, so I usually take the car if I go to have dinner with friends in a central place
I could take a taxi but I don't think it's worth the money if I'm only going to have dinner, and I could do the return trip home walking, but again we're comparing 10 minutes to almost 1 hour, and uphill
Self imposed (because it’s a looooot faster), but yes
I’m trying to get my ass off my laurels, though, and get at least the A1 motorbike license
Most of the time I’m driving alone, so it reeeeeeealy doesn’t make sense to drive a 5 door car just to haul one single person
The fact that you have to sit through (less) traffic is a plus, but I feel very embarrassed driving a car just for one
E: Although if I have to go to the office, it’s very impractical to try to park in the city centre, so I don’t actually mind taking public transport then
Kinda
I'm in a 20k inhabitant town, where you can walk anywhere and I have everything I need to live, but when I go out with friends or want to go shopping, I usually go to a couple of cities that are within 40 km, for that I use my car
Public transport to those cities is bad
Bus to Oviedo (19 km away) doesn't pass too often, and to Gijón (35 km away) there's only a train that takes 1 hour
Also after going there I'd need to use the public transport inside those cities to go wherever so (if i lived there I could use a bike, I guess) ... It takes twice or three times as much than going by car
I didn't get a driver licence until a year ago (I'm 31) and I never suffered for it
Even now I use the car as little as possible, if it's 25 minutes away by foot I'll walk, and if it can be reached with public transport also within reasonable time I'll pick that over driving

Well, we have cave paintings from prehistoric era, they are not Spanish (since Spain as a nation is a recent concept) but yeah, we have old stuff here
>Altamira's fame stems from the fact that its paintings were the first European cave paintings for which a prehistoric origin was suggested and promoted
I live minutes away from Qart Hadasht or Cartago Nova, the headquarters of Hannibal and the Carthaginians in Spain and it's quite thrilling for me
There's even a [functional Roman theater]  from the time
In general, there are a lot of ruins from the Roman time around Spain, to the point it's difficult to build a parking lot or a subway since you can find ruins "easily".
A lot of Moor ruins from the middle age can also be easily found
In my city a lot of malls or parking lots that were planned couldn't be built because they kept finding Muslim baths or ruins
Romanesque churches, also from the middle age, can also be found around the place easily
I guess it's proportional to the time a certain civilisation remains, and it depends on the kind of civilisation it was
Romans were crazy engineers and architects and they were around for centuries, so it's only natural there's a lot of Roman constructions still today
The same for Moors
Also, they wrote a lot of stuff
The more you write, the more information you give about your civilisation
In Rome there were guys like Dion Casio who wrote almost the whole History of their time, and documents like Historia Augusta are direct text books from the time
[Palmeral or Elche]
Not a lof of ruins in the city (destroyed or buried), but the Palmeral is the living proof of centuries of development by different cultures
In Spain is very common to find ruins, I've even helped archeologists to map a Roman metal facility with drones
There are zones, like Madrid, where it's really difficult to build in some areas because every time you dig, ruins appear and they're protected, you can't continue building
well if you talk abaut artifacts of museum its harder than you thing but we have many zones but honestly in the cities not that much now,
Abaut historical building and all of that yes just in front of my school we have a palace of the XIV and my school itself its a palace of the XV
In my city before the destruction of almost all of the palace we where the second city of europe with more just behind of Florence with around 360 now we have 36 and some reconverted, the churches has also be damaged specially with the period of Mendizabal and a great part of the churches are now administrative buildings, also for example the church of San Benito wich was almost as big and rich as the cathedral becouse it was one of the core centers of the order of the Benedictians, this building has its 2 upper plant demolish for bad condition
&#x200B;
So yes Europe was and still rich in historical building but at least Spain has lost a lot of it
&#x200B;
Edit: i almost forget to say the name of my city, i live in Valladolid
I just watched in the news a 5000 years old Necropolis was found in a cave, so when they study it well have more info about our history
my school is a palace from the XV
that was pretty common even in roman periods
the constantin arch for example, or a lot of the greek bronze statues to make others
well this are just preference
we have some here also due to the civil war
in Barcelona, you can pay either by cash (in bus only for a single ticket) and in the metro with the ticket machines you can buy tickets
The thing is our tickets are so old fashioned that it's still cardboard, single use type of tickets
Not contactless or anything like that, and if its a ticket that you need to count the remaining trips, it'll be printed on the back side
It can also happen that you buy these monthly or three months pass ticket, but it's still gonna be cardboard, which sucks because it always breaks
So, in the entrance, for the metro you need to have a ticket, or you can't get in, and in the bus you may pay to the driver for a single ticket (which is of course super expensive) but nothing else
In Madrid you can get an [_abono_] (travel card) that you pay for monthly
I believe it’s around 55€ Flat rate per month, or 20€ if you’re under 26, for all of the central zone, which covers a huge portion of the city
All busses, metro, and cercanias (suburban lite rail) are included (inside zone 1)
You can also buy a metro card and buy individual trips for it which cost 1,50€ per trip
You can buy these at any metro station
You can pay cash on busses, once again 1
50€ per trip, but they only accept maximum 5€ notes
I’ve seen master card and visa stickers on some busses which leads me to believe that they are phasing in contactless payment, but I’ve only seen it a few times and never actually tried paying that way
That would be very handy because there have been several times that it’s been the day that I have to top my card up for the month and haven’t had less than 5€ notes to get on the bus to go to the metro station to top my card up
NFC cards from the company of public transport of the Balearic Islands, or with cash, although I think they only accept 5€ notes
You won't be able to pay with credit or debit cards not with your phone
You can get a public transportation card and recharge it however you prefer (debit card, cash, etc)
Madrid had the old cardboard tickets with the tick marks until last year when they replaced them with a plastic card
Unfortunately now you have to pay 2
50 or 3€ for the new card just to load it with viajes, so I suppose the Madrid Metro system is making some nice profits off everyone spending 3€ extra every time they visit
Especially because I have a stack of tourist abonos at my house but every time someone comes to visit, there’s no way to get it to them unless I meet them at the airport so they have to buy a new one
To be fair, Madrid has some of the best public transport I’ve ever seen, and 1,50€ per trip is a pretty good deal, so 3€ extra is a small price to pay when you compare it to transport costs in Paris, Berlin, or London
when i went to madrid i remember paying more for that plastic card, but if its possible to get the money back by giving the card back (like the oyster in london) then i see no issue with paying 3 euros for it tbh
The most common saying in Spain is ‘patata’ (potato)
Some of the regions with their own official languages may use others though
patata
it looks like you are just screaming in terror
"Patata" which is obviously potato, and when we grew up we changed to "whisky". But patata is the real one
I've seen the "whisky" thing when you just want to be funny when you're 9 years old saying "taboo" words
Even adults lol
Yeah, that’s so true
Perhaps the idea behind it is that all those /a/ can force your mouth in the shape of a more open laugh
Oh so you are from Spain
Do you support Real Madrid or Barcelona
- I don't like football
This happens everywhere I go
"how do you like Spanish omelette
if there are 2 or more people from Spain you will provoke a war that won't end well
I'm mixed genetically and culturally from two nations so when people ask me where I'm from and I say 'half A and half B' after hearing the A part they don't hear the B part and only concentrate on the A. So it's kind of annoying because I can't really claim to be just from one place
Usually after knowing the nationality you don't ask if we like chorizo in paella or tortilla de patatas with or without onion
It is not good
For American: You don't ask where in Mexico/South America is Spain
or say that I'm not black so I should not be Spanish
Thanks
This happens a lot, I don't like football at all and I don't care about it
I don't have anything against people who like it
Funny, I was to post the same exact question and my answer is the same too
Why do they always ask it
Oh god, same
I just say "Barcelona haha" and go on
Even if Idk anything about football nor care about it
Specially middle easterners, some guys seem to care more about the Barça/Madrid thing than most spaniards

Spanish Marines Corps is the oldest in the world
Shortest border in the world in the Peñón Velez de la Gomera, with Morocco
74 meters

I'm Spain the F1 and Moto GP can drive people crazy too
A lot of people follow the motor sports (F1, Moto GP), Tennis and Basketball quite a lot too ... Although going crazy on them like we do on football, I'd say that's only the case for Basketball in the Balcans area
I mean, it can always get crazy in Europe regardless of the sport, but football levels of crazyness isn't as common with other Sports
Tennis is general is pretty chill
That's probably the most peaceful sport generally xd
It's rather because they just changed the word "football" to "soccer" so they coud coin the first to mean something completely different of their own
American Football can barely be called football
Indeed, but I gave up with Valentino Rossi, emperor of the track
In fact, Sete Gibernau was an eternal second, which is actually not that bad
But always at the shadow of Valentino
The point is that Valentino was also a honest rider, no tricks involved, only massive speed
I didn't knew that part
It seems to be a double risk for the drivers
Helmet always on
Yes, and this is the proof that a slight difference in this sport makes a huge difference on the results
We'd just be wondering why everyone is sitting down to have dinner at 7pm
The Spaniard probably would be still working in his job afternoon/evening shift while the rest of Europeans have dinner
And anyway, dinner is less important in Spain
The main meal where all the family gather is lunch
But nobody remembers Spain introducing potatoes to Europe
Lot of Olive oil in that table
At 18 I'm still at work, how am I supposed to eat dinner
Though most likely Spain would have brought a 12-pack of shitty beer instead, offending all their South Europeans brothers
I love the history of the colonies
Like how they developed and grew and how lives were there and the relationships with the natives and the guerrillas and all that
But usually colonies are just taught as like "EMPIRE": GOLD, MONEY, WARSHIPS and all that stuff
Which is also cool but you know
The Americas did not belong to the *kingdom* of Castille, but they did belong to the *crown* of Castille
This was because the crown of Castille consisted of [***several***] kingdoms
We were taught that one of the reasons of the inability of the Crown of Aragon to do much was due to the fact that it consisted of several kingdoms with conflicting interests
without mentioning that Castille *also* consisted of billions more kingdoms (plus the overseas kingdoms
So apparently, Castille was this single cohesive unit that was efficient, where as Aragon was fragmented and chaotic
Right
(Can you tell I was educated in Madrid
E: context: I always found the politization of our history in the Catalonian education system very weird, “but at least they didn’t do the same here”. I was such a sweet summer child back then  Actually, now that I think about it, we weren’t really taught anything about any of the individual kingdoms in the crown at all, but that might have been due to lack of time
They don't teach you the 80 years war
I really don't get it
Like most of it ocurred in belgium or the entherlands: maastrich, breda, antwerp, Empel, nieuwport, ostende, etc etc etc
Like today's belgium was under the spanish monarchy, they fought constanly in the wars
In Spain is usually called the war of Flandes
Yeah
My peruvian friend was taught that Spain stole all their gold, whereas I was told that we took all the gold to pay foreign bankers (to fund wars)
So Spain was essentially a node in a global conveyor belt of gold
Well, to be fair "Belgium" was the Roman name of the region so it had been used to refer to the Low Countries in general since the Renaissance
Including the Netherlands
So back then it wasn't that much about later Belgian national identity
I think the first Japanese dictionary was in Portuguese, before they expelled the Jesuits
I think it depends
In my experience it was talked about but overall the colonial history of Spain was taught in an extremely condensed way
The focus is put mostly on the events that succeded in Europe during those centuries
Lol not at all
It is teached as one of the wars in which spain spent a part of its enormous fortune just to keep it catholic and under spanish rule
Our armed forces day is celebrated after the Empel's miracle and we are taught as a fucking useless war in which spain wanted to fight because of honor (not kidding, actuall history) while at the same time we fought the french, the turks, the english, the scotts and the other half of europe
Fun fact: there is an expression in spanish that would be like "putting a pyke in Flanders" when something is veeery costly in money and other resources
Tgis comes fron the fact that spanish troypes would use the "spanish road", a logistic setup (kind of impressive) in which men were shipped to genoa and walked through milan, switzerland the frankish-county and other german catholic nations up to flanders
This eas only pissible because spain was stinky ritch back then
Probably the shared news here about the Catalonia's issue
Although it's true that no Spanish or Catalan media is unbiased, it's like Catalonia's news in foreign media\* are written from what some random "expert" has told, instead of more extensive and true explanations
Some news were like we were going to have Yugoslavia 2
0, instead of what it is: a political shitshow to blame each other
Gibraltarian claiming in r/badhistory, of all places, that Spanish schools silence the Spanish Armada and the fact that the English sunk every single Spanish ship
While in reality, the Armada is overrated in schools if anything (there is no mention of the Counterarmada and the fact that the peace treaty was favorable to Spain, for one), and the fate of every Spanish ship is accesible to anyone with access to Wikipedia:
- 7 lost to the English (1 of them sunk)
- 30 or so sunk on rough weather during the trip back around Ireland and Scotland
- Maybe 30 more scuttled after making it to port due to damage
- About 60 more intact
I honestly think all Southern European countries can be considered culturally Mediterranean
Portugal has culturally a lot more in common with Italy than with Britain, even if both are Atlantic
Not to mention she was quite outside the KGB jurisdiction, being from Yugoslavia
I've heard this about Romania IRL hahaha
Breaking News: The ENTIRE maltese fleet is sailing up the Danube to attack a reddit user that goes by the name "mki\_".
>That being said, allegedly polish government is currently trying to ban propagation and usage of any marxist publications such as Marx or Róża Luksemburg
Wtf
That is pretty authoritarian, considering that Marx an Rosa Luxembourg weren't even authoritarian themselves
They aren't the same as Stalin or Mao
Except for the sudden financial burden you impose on your loved ones, as they suddenly have to pay [about $7

Let's say that our former King Juan Carlos hasn't been the most loyal to his wife and hasn't been very good managing money
And both things are kind
of connected
King Juan Carlos II and a leaked photo with his grandson next to a dead elephant they just shot dead in a hunting safari (he was honorable member of the animal's rights ngo WWF at that time)
He just gave a poor apology in national TV and that was it
Also recently after he abdicated and his son took the throne, he left the country to "avoid damaging the royal family image" and was found in UAE, where he resides now
I just saw a video about him the other day
It was so crazy watching how he became a celebrity (and also alphabetized) behind bars writting books for children and a questionable biography
He sure lived and died like a rockstar
Indeed
I think he was the personification of perversion
He took the advantage of being the rags-to-rich story line and the "changed person" to clean his image and keep killing prostitutes while investigating the murders
I bet that when they discovered the truth, he had a surprised pikachu face
Barbie Girl by Aqua, it felt like my childhood was torn down
It changes my views on songs from my childhood
For example i heard ["That don't impress me much"] for the first time in 10 years and i thought the lyrics were really pretentious and that they didn't fit some parts of the song
They exist and they are somewhat popular, some children do, but it's not a tradition at all
As a kid, I didn't like them and never wanted to go there because I didn't like the idea of some people taking care of my who weren't my parents and sleeping outside of my house ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ
My brother, some of our friends an me where send to summer camps a couple of years
One of those friends now works there in summer
They are pretty popular, every year there is a long waitlist to the most popular places
To apply to one you do it like for university: you chose five and put in a preference list; there is also a point system that puts you next year at the top of the list if you didn't get in
I went since I was 8 until I was 13
And no, I didn't drink alcohol or had sex on them
I guess they considered those safe ages and avoid older teenagers
Congratulations
Ironic
They could save others from non-question posts
But not themselves
The tragedy of Darth Modis the powerhigh
Literally never
I only went when I was 7 because I had a tooth coming while the old one didn’t fall yet
They took it out and the new one aligned perfectly
I don’t know, my teeth aren’t crooked at all (God bless my genetics for this), never had any pain and I have good dental hygiene so I never needed it
Reading the comments here are making me think I should go more D:
Just got my yearly cleanup this week (which is done by an hygienist but in the same clinic as the actual dentist one, so "going to the dentist" sometimes refers to the clinic and not to the professional)
My insurance recommends 2 per year but my cleanups last 10-15 minutes and I don't get too much tartar from year to year so my hygienist says that once per year is more than ok
I still got pending for later this month my also yearly dental checkup and orthodontics checkup, so in a normal year I go 3 times but with three different professionals and around the same dates
I honestly don't know what's the average
I started to actually care much more about my dental care visits since I spent a fortune in the orthodontist
Once or twice a year, depending in how I feel and how I think my mouth is
Almost everything regarding the Western Caliphate of Al-Andalus, which rivaled the one in Bagdad and had the largest city in Europe at the time, with 1M living in the capital, Corduba
Also some of the important intricacies of the Civil War, like the bullshit "International neutrality" that basically gave Hitler a free pass to test  German weaponry and tactics in Spanish civilians
I've always been fascinated by this period but I have no idea where to start learning about it
Do you have any source or link to learn a bit of what went down
Yeah, that's true
The little medieval Portuguese history I know it's due to historical TV series and Wikipedia rabbit holes
Hmmm
I think we focused more on events that were either directly related to us (that time they invaded us in order to invade you too) or that affected the world on a bigger scale (French revolution, Napoleon, colonialism, WWII; we learn a bit about Portuguese maritime discoveries and the Treaty of Tordesillas too)
But I don't think we learn much medieval French history, at least not that comes to mind
How's the Developer landscape in Finland
Is Finnish a hard requisite
What about education versus work experience
If I ever want to say goodbye to Spain's sun, it'd be a nice place to stay for a while
We abolished capital punishment only in 1978 with the approval of the new constitution, which bans capital punishment except in times of war for military justice
This was just after the end of the dictatorship
As such it was both a vote in the Cortes and by the people, although it was not in normal circumstances
As far as I know there's no one that is seriously considering amending the constitution to allow the State to kill people, but there are crazies everywhere, so probably
EDIT: It is also no longer a punishment in the Military Penal Code, since its reform in 1995, and as such it has been completely abolished in all cases and circumstances
The later ratification of the European Convention of Human Rights means the only way of re-establishing capital punishment in Spain would be to repudiate the Convention and then pass an Organic Law reforming the Military Penal Code, or an amendment to the Constitution, or both
In the Transition to Democracy, in the 70's
The last people executed where members of a basque terrorist group in 1975
Or American
So yeah, what you said
In Spain: Latin American immigrants have the same language, so they adapt easier
Besides, if they stay for just two years legally they can apply for the Spanish nationality
For the rest of the world it's harder but in general I think we are not xenophobic
Yep, they have a hard time unless they're from latin america, those integrate even better than europeans
I always comment that the word expat is a  racist term to differentiate immigrants from poor (usually black or brown) countries from immigrants from wealthy countries
You'd still call an engineer from Brazil that finds a job in Germany an immigrant, so a German engineer that finds s job in Brazil is an immigrant as well, not an expat
I recommend everyone to avoid using the word as much as they can if not eliminating it entirely while being aware of its connotations
I just checked it out of curiosity and apparently it's 2 years for people from former Spanish territories, 5 for refugees and 10 for the rest
It's only one year for other specific cases, like being born here
Source (in Spanish):
Sorry, I should have said Hispanic, I totally overlooked Brazil and French Guyana
Well, most of the Americans I've met  were really nice and they were all people that had traveled around and therefore cool people to spend time with, but there's also the pervasive stereotype of Americans being arrogant, competitive, bigoted, etc
Most Americans that come to Spain are not like that, but you have a bad reputation in general
There's also Trump
Which hasn't improved your reputation much
No, that's the difference between an immigrant and a non-citizen permanent resident
Let's put it that way
Would a Turkish guy be called an expat in Germany or any other rich country despite the time he expects to spend in Germany or the quality of the job he is doing
I don't see it
> países iberoamericanos, Andorra, Filipinas, Guinea Ecuatorial, Portugal o personas de origen sefardí.
No, but EU citizens have practically the same rights as a citizen (healthcare, scholarships, etc
I said "former territories" to sum it up, but it's just this list
Former colonies where Spanish is still spoken would be a better description
I'm not an expert, you'd have to ask a lawyer
The text says that the person would have to reside in Spain for that time in a legal, continued way, immediately before making this request
Maybe in your brother's case it wasn't continuous, maybe the rules were different then, I don't know
I'm an immigrant in the USA
I come from Spain and I came here with a very good contract and I can always come back to Spain
I'm not an expat because I feel no need to differentiate myself from a hard working guy from El Salvador
Not in the country
It is a day off in Madrid, but not because of May 1st, but because May 2nd (local holiday in Madrid) was on Sunday, and was moved to Monday
Rest of the country
no day off
Holidays sometimes “transfer” to Monday when they fall on a Sunday, but not when they fall on a Saturday
Coincidentally, May 2nd is a regional holiday in Madrid and since it fell on a Sunday they transferred it to today
So the region of Madrid does have the day off today
Yes, only holidays that coincide with Sunday are transferable to the following Monday
In some places today is a holiday bcs re held the "Crosses of May" or the "Day of the Cross". For my, its usually a day of reduced working hours (we finish at 12 noon), but as this year can`t be celebrated we have kept the normal work schedule :(
You guys irish are clever
In corona times
Three showers a week at most, sometimes even less, lol
In normal times, every other day, unless it's very warm or I've been to the gym, or something like that
In the summer in Spain, sometimes up to twice a day
Did you mean a shower
I haven’t taken a bath since I was a kid
Most adults in Spain don’t take baths on a regular basis
In fact, many homes have a shower booth instead of a bathtub
If you meant shower, most people in Spain shower once a day
I don’t think it’s common to take more than one shower a day
I personally tend to shower less than that, like every other day, but I don’t know of many people who do same
Once a day seems to be the norm
Daily showers on summer, once every other day the rest of the seasons
I haven't bathed in at least 5 years or so
I take a shower daily, though
in summer every day
And during the winter usually day yes , day no, alternatively
Anybody using the public transport in London or other big cities would have a hard time believing that "most people" shower once a day
In my circles at least everybody seems to shower at least once a day
I sometimes skip a day or "half a day" (as in maybe shower at night today when I showered in the morning yesterday) in winter if I am not being very active and I don't have to go anywhere, and I'd imagine more people do that
But it's also common for some people to shower more than once if they go to the beach or exercise (or anything else that leads to sweating)
Personally I try to make it "fit" my schedule so I would shower at that time anyway
So if I have a rugby practise or I'm going to the gym tomorrow I'll shower tonight before sleeping so I can go through the morning without a shower and I'll take one after the activity
Because I am staying indoors most of the time, so I am barely sweating, I am not getting all the grime and dirt of the city on me as I would when going to the office, and if I do sweat a little bit, nobody has to put up with any odours other than me, and I can tolerate them
Also, my skin is not great, so showering every day is not a great idea, even in normal times
That said, this doesn't mean I don't try to stay as clean as possible
Let me introduce you to the concept of "agüita sobaquera" (hard to translate, the best I can do is "a little armpit wash")
Do you cut the pizza with scissors
Me and other Spaniards got much hate during my Erasmus for cutting the pizza with scissors instead of a pizza cutter
Do you use scissors in your country too or are we the only weirdos
Never heard of it or did it
I usually cut pizza with a knife (I have a cutter that I always misplace just when I need it)
On the other hand, I see absolutely no problem with it
Whatever works for you
Your pizza, your rules
I might even try it next time I eat pizza just to check how it works
I'm Spanish too, and cutting pizza with scissors is the best thing in life
I also got ridiculed by my English friends for doing so
I'll never stop doing it
Yes, always, this is the most practical way to do it, if you don't want to buy a pizza cutter the scissors is the easiest way yo cut it because knife is not easy and effective
Do you cut pizza with scissor
What a psyco xD
I have always seen it cut with a pizza cutter or a knife in the worst case scenario
What part of Spain are you from
As a fellow Spaniard I have to say
yes, of course
Our pizza cutter is dull as a pebble
scissors are way better than a knife
My German ex used to cut the pizza with scissors, too
I knew it is a taboo in Italy, but I didn’t think it would be a problem anywhere else
Yes, I've always done it that way and I didn't know until fairly recently that is not a normal thing outside Spain xD
Yes
We have a pizza cutter at home but I think it's easier and faster to use scissors
My brother and his friends use scissors and it has been said many times it's because they are too incompetent to use a normal cutter or a knife because they smudge the toppings
Yo también soy español y nunca he usado tijeras, lo siento amigo, estás solo en esto
It has never crossed my mind before and I can't see why, cause it sounds rather convenient
I use scissors
They are easy to use, quite fast, they don’t spreads the ingredients as sometimes the pizza cutter does, they are very easy to clean
You can use scissors for more stuff than just pizza so is a more valuable tool
I study in the UK and my housemates FLIPPED when I did it
Scissors are basically a must have when dealing with fish, and we do like our fish
Vegetables
Lol, I've never seen anyone do that, it's not a thing
Pizza, yeah, definitely
Having a kitchen tool that you only use for 1 thing seems silly (that said, I have not one, but two pizza cutters
im one of that people that use scissors for the pizza but i had never heard of cutting vegetables with them
I like your mindset
It's not very good, I think a cutter is much better
But I don't know why, I always use the scissors
i had always used a pizza cutter but when we broke it we just start cutting it with scissors
I have a pizza cutter but when it's not available the next best thing are scissors
Why better than a knife
I didn't expect this answer from an Italian, thanks hahahah That's why I use it, if you have a good pizza cutter is so nice, but if not you just mess up the cheese
The question is why would someone want to have a sharp blade that only cuts one thing
Btw I use whatever I have to cut pizza
Knife, scissors
A pizza cutter makes sense in a pizzeria with many sales because it allows you to cut the pizza very fast, right after the oven without touching it and burning your hands
At home it’s 100% dull
That's the kind of answer I was expecting
I guess because a lot of us don't have a pizza cutter, and if we have one they're so bad that does not cut properly
It's still a discovering if it's independent
I did my Erasmus in Germany and the Germans were the ones who complained more
Ciudad Real, but I've studied in Madrid and many people from different places did the same (most from the south though)
Where are you from
I love how the most annoyed people are not Italian, I didn't expect that
I am indeed an heretic, and a proud one
We use kitchen scissors, like they are no paper scissors, so it is easy to cut
And mostly homemade pizza or cheap shitty one from the supermarkets, in restaurants you get it cut or a pizza cutter
Germans were the more concerned about it during my Erasmus, and Italians in the thread do not seem to care
I'm confused
Hahahahaha we usually have special scissors for the kitchen, so that's not a problem
It's just another cooking tool
Not animals, just uneducated people that don't know the wonderful tools that kitchen scissors are
I think that's the Roman way ("pizza al tagglio")
Can any Italian confirm
I've never seen anyone cutting a lettuce, arugula or any other leafy vegetable without scissors
I use the pizza cutter for the pizza though haha
more demand = more products = more posible to get a bad one  ???
From Granada
Well, I think it was more of an assumption, because all around traditional pizza seems sacred
Not the most Spanish thing, but if it works, it works
An Italian pizza dealer in my neighborhood uses a spatula to cut and serve pizza
Hahahaha sometimes you need somebody to let you know
Best:Trajan for me
Everything from his age is just fantastic, he was a man that put Rome over himself
He was not only an impressive militar but also he made a lot of public infrastructure and overall, he was behind one of the brightest periods of all the Roman history
Honourable mentions to Octavious, Claudius and Marcus Aurelius
Some obscure favourites of me:
- Pertinax: the man had a good spirit and really tried to solve the problems Commodus left behind
I think he could have been a great emperor if it wasn't for his untimely end
- Septimius Severus, but specially Julia Domna: Severus was a great militar, and overall a good emperor
However, it seems like the role that his wife Julia played there was huge
She was a master manipulator and a great politician, and it seems like she really pulled some strings during Severus and Caracalla's time
Some even say that her sister Maesa followed her instructions after dead to establish Heliogabalus as emperor
She certainly was one of the most influential women in History and I think some credit should be given to her
If i remember correctly i would say Trajano due to him be the first for the peninsula and becouse i like the arch of Trajano or the road that was made in spanish called "via trajana" i dont know how this would be called in other languages
Neron
Good speech about what too much power for one person means, and what blind obedience for peasants does
Can't deny I have a soft spot for him and Hadrian indeed
I don't care that much about Theodosius though
Murcia, El Mundo Today won't leave them alone
The Army goes to Murcia to see if people still live there:
He discovers at the age of 20 that he lives in Murcia but his parents hid it from him:
The Government reminds the Spanish who intended to travel to Africa this summer that Murcia is also there:
I feel sorry for Murcia, sometimes
Lepe is the base for jokes of dumb people, tho nowadays most people don't use that kind of jokes
We also have Soria, as completely devoid of people
And Lepe, which IS basically the bottom of all the "how studpid" jokes
An example: why do the police Cars in Lepe have a bathtub
>!to Carry the siren
But Lepe is the classic one
>I feel sorry for Murcia, sometimes
Then i remember they voted for VOX and It goes away
Murcia doesn't even exist, it's a conspiracy made up by our government
Then there's Teruel, they even have a political party called Teruel Exists lmao
For sure Murcia, but I would say Galicia gets their part too
Im from Murcia
Can confirm
All my friends outside murcia mock us because of that
If only they knew we have the best gastronomy of the country and one of the most healty lifestyles
Acho pijo
Tbf not all of us voted for it
Actually Im from a town that voted mostly for the PSOE
As a murcian I can only say I wish
I was looking for *this* comment
I understand
I come from a town so right wing i was praying for the PP to beat VOX (Podemos didn't even bother putting up posters
I'm from Madrid, just sayin'
Im so scared of the rising of the alt right
Well, at least its not growing as fast as before
Madrid
I mean, the vast majority of Spanish media is recorded or shot in Madrid
Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia
Madrid and Barcelona's metropolitan areas are roughly the same size, 5-6 million inhabitants (although Madrid city's population is the twice of Barcelona)
Valencia is far smaller with around 1,5 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area
Both Valencia an Barcelona are located in the Mediterranean coast and have both Spanish and Catalan/Valencian as their languages, while Madrid is monolingual and located in the middle of the Spanish plateau
Madrid is a big city
Good place to live but that's it
Its the capital so it has some good museums but not much else
Barcelona is a tourist city
Prices are high and its one of the most unsafe cities in Spain (its not really unsafe, but pickpocketing is rampant)
People used to just leave the city and live somewhere far from the tourists
Valencia combines the best of the two
Not very touristy but it's full of amazing stuff and it's one of the best places to live
People come for the experience, food, and nightlife
Madrid and Barcelona are good places as well bit I've never been to Madrid and I was a tourist in Barcelona so I don't really know much
I'm also a bit biased since I'm from Valencia so take it with a grain of salt
Hmm
I always thought Bilbao would be the third biggest
Actuallly, it's the sixth in size of its metropolitan area ([
In Spain there is a 95% vaccinated rate for children below 2 so experts say obligatory vaccines are not necessary
If there is a break of measles in a zone with low vaccination rate a judge could order the people to take the vaccines
Are you talking about the judge thing
It's not a region, it's a zone
I guess the translation would be a District (barrio in Spanish), two streets and the people infected would be like 20
I think that having a two thousand  people vaccinated would be better than none but I guess there was no hope for then to not get sick
Yeah they are usually translated
Yes, in spanish they all change and the Pope also
Prince William and his wife Kate are el príncipe Guillermo and Catalina de Cambridge
But king Harald of Norway is still Harald, and i don't know why
Maybe it's because they didn't know how to translate it, or it isn't a christian/latin name
I was blown away by how cool, architecturally and culturally diverse, and geographically gorgeous Sarajevo is
Definitely one of the best kept secrets in Europe, and the fact that it was absolutely leveled during my lifetime seems more relatable than visiting other European cities that may have faced similar issues 60 years before I was born
It's absolutely astounding that the city was able to bounce back so quickly
I also had a magnificent time in Romania
Bucharest is a bit boring, but Brasov and Sinaia are such  picturesque little towns, and the mountainous landscape around Transylvania is truly breathtaking
Southern Russia seems nice, the caucasus and all that
And northern spain is criminally underrated
Agreed
Went there last October-November and I really enjoyed the experience
Brașov, the Carpathian mountains and Transylvania are amongst my favourite places in the world now
I visited Bratislava in 2011 and was not so impressed
I have friends who went back in 2016 and raved about how nice of a place it was
I have not yet made it back there but plan to sometime soon
Was there a lot of improvements going on in recent years
I've only been to Saint Petersburg, but I can confirm it's breathtaking, definitely the most beautiful city (in architectural terms) I've visited
Asturias has great landscapes, and you can visit the [roman remains of Lugo]  or the medieval part of [Santiago] near the Cathedral
Theres also the [Cies Islands] wich are probably the cleanest in Europe, and a natural reserve open to the public
Most beaches in northern spain are pretty clean anyway
thanks to the lack of mass tourism
Thanks for the info
I'm definitely more about the vibe and environment while traveling, I've seen more old churches and statues than I care to think about
I'll definitely check it out soon :)
Will do
Thank God you said what it was, I thought they were stating their age, and was trying too hard to figure out why was that relevant at all
Language: Basque       Band: Berri Txarrak   Song: [Bueltatzen]
Band: Kalakan/Orekatx   Song: [Harria Herria]
Language: Valencian   Band: Obrint Pas  Song: [Flama]
Language: Asturianu   Band: Desakato    Song: [N'alcordanza]
There is a variety of traditional instruments in Spain, along with a variety of languages
Could you share the playlist once finished
It would be great
BTW, my suggestion would be Fiesta Pagana, from Mago de Oz
[Extremoduro - La Vereda De La Puerta De Atrás] Their album La Ley Innata is amazing too, the best Spanish rock album I've heard
Oooh boy, I have two favorite rock groups [Extremoduro] , [another extremoduro song] , [another one] [Marea] [another one of marea] also [La fuga]
There are lot of groups but my favorite is Extremoduro (30+ years playing music) there are a lot of kind of songs, more punk, more relaxed, etc
If you like Extremoduro I recommend you to hear "La ley innata" this album is brutally good, lot of changes in the music which make it unique
I still hearing this group and it is amazing, if you like it and wants some recommendation you can ask me ;)
Also in the spanish rock the bass is incredible
My girlfriend likes this one
[Medina Azahara - Córdoba]
Very southern, with flamenco touches
[Another northern one] just for balance
I would like to add Salduie
Very underapreciated one
In Spain to invest in marketing is not a priority, usually
[DESCARNATIO - SALDUIE]
&#x200B;
very good band
Very nice band
I would also add [Ayreon]
I really like that band
This two voices play is amazing
Woodan Herst is for me, still the best
I don't know what this voices have
As for metal, I would recommend [Fiesta Pagana by Magö de Oz] It is a classic of folk metal in Spain; it's so popular even people who are not into metal know this song and it's played in a lot of parties because of its lyrics about the working-class people fighting against its oppressors
But most importantly, it features traditional instruments (mostly from the North) of Spain, such as the Spanish guitar, the bagpipe, the flute and the accordion
And it's catchy af
I like your style
If I may add some more:
* [Extremoduro - stand by]
* [Los Suaves - Dolores se llamaba Lola]
You are welcome;)
came here to mention Los Suaves
Charles II had a whole list of mental issues, but in his favour he didn't do anything actually insane and instead let his regents to reestabilize the already decadent empire as well as they could, which was a nice change of pace after being at war with everyone under his father Philip IV
On the other hand his successor Philip V, on addition of being french saw his mental health quickly deteriorating as he got older, suffering from some kind of chronic manic depression
He knew about it and abdicated in his son Louis, but he had the impoliteness of dying in a month and the increadingly nutty old man had to go back
He spent a good deal of his late reign bedridden, where he spent his days refusing to change clothes, living among the filth, screaming, biting courtesans and trying to escape, while the Queen took charge of the state affairs
Ferdinand VI apparently attacked his visitors due to dementia, and Charles II was extremelly inbred
>\[Charles\] suffered ill-health and has been described as "short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely  bald before 35, always on the verge of death but repeatedly baffling  Christendom by continuing to live
[Rest in piece sweet prince
Ferdinand the 7th
Franco Basically
He ruined the republic, made a fascist regime, banned local cultures and languages and forced Castilian traditions on all
*Sigh*, if they only knew cities skylines back in the day
Dollfuss looks pretty much like a Doofus
To think we had Juana “la loca” (the mad) and she probably wouldn’t make it into my top 3
Inbreeding is a terrible thing indeed
Well, we will see how you do with Bolsonaro
I had no idea that was Ferdinad Vi
Don't you mean Philip V?
Hey let's name the son of the King of England the heir to the throne of France, that makes perfect sense
Castilian traditions my ass
Look at the promotion of Andalusian coplas and bullfighting during the nadir of the 1940s and 1950s. Is that Castilian
Franco was a greedy sociopath, a small man complex, a meapilas, a neomedievalist, a British stereotype of a Spaniard, a totalitarian asshole, an antiintellectual, but he was in no way a Castilian nationalist and it is a shame that younger Spaniards seem to be absorving this foreign mischaracterization that pretends to equate Spain with Yugoslavia and Castile with Serbia
Castillian
How many *sevillana* dresses have you seen people wear in Castilla
How many times have you seen a *flamenco* show there
Both Philip V and Ferdinand VI had mental issues apparently
Henry VIII got the jackpot then
TIL thank you
I never looked deep into him so I sort if assumed he was like, okay
At least he didn't fuck up big time like others
The most famous one has to be the trial of Madrid bombing terrorists, presided over by judge Javier Gómez Bermúdez
Other notorious cases are:
- Gürtel case
A corruption case affecting the Popular Party to an enormous scale
It has been divided into a lot of separate cases due to its own enormity
- Bárcenas case
A spin-off of Gürtel
Bárcenas was the treasurer of the Popular Party for a lot of years, and he organised a whole system of money laundering in order to launder the money coming from bribes, which he later distributed in cash among the top officers of the party
- Filesa
A corruption case affecting the Socialist Party in the 1980s.
- GAL
The socialist government in the 1980s organised the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación, a state-sponsored terrorist group targeting the members of the Basque separatist terrorist group ETA
- "Procès" case
The members of the Catalan government from 2017 and the presidents of Òmnium and Assemblea Nacional Catalana were tried for their attempt at Catalan secession
They were sentenced to 9-12 years in prison for sedition in medial joinder with aggravated malversation of public funds
- Rocío Waningkopf (not sure on the actual orthography) case
Said girl was murdered in the 1990s, and the case became a very notable one against the whole concept of the jury
The woman found guilty by the jury was actually innocent, and it was quite evident that the public opinion, and the jury, had been prejudiced against her for being a lesbian
The José Bretón case, a father who burned alive his son and daughter as a revenge to his ex-wife
Good examples
I would also add Nagore Lafarge case, Spain vs Franco family for "Pazo de Meiras" and the "La Manada" one
What I find more interesting is cases involving interesting legalities (opinions, decisions etc
) more than just a case becoming famous because the public wanted a different verdict or a case determining the fate of a party in elections
Uh, that's a trend the US started and it's linguistically very annoying
The German approach is one I like though: inclusion by, essentially, including women through feminine acknowledgement
Rather than dismissing gender as irrelevant and trying to bury it away
Oh, don't get me started
That's probably the worst
1) It's unpronouncable 2) It was made in the US and is popularized in English, which means it leaves behind the way actual Spanish speakers speak 3) it's based on Latino, which isn't a great term anyways 4) it assumes recognizing gender is inherently bad, and thus eliminates recognition of women through feminine words 5) it goes against cultural and linguistic heritage 6) most Spanish speakers don't use it, don't want it, don't identify with it, and many outright hate it
7) it serves little purprose, since 'Hispanic' is gender neutral anyways, and most Spanish speakers prefer it (or 'Spanish' where applicable)
Well that's certainly a TIL
I can see the logic, and it seems reasonable enough to treat the safety net as a 'rainy day fund' if that's what voters want
Just not something I expected to see
We don't, the common phrase for "thank you" is simply "gracias" and that's it
But you can also say "we lo agradezco" (I thank you) o "se lo agradecemos" (We thank you) but it sounds formal and it's not that common on the day to day
We should also point out that if we want to be very specific we can say "Gracias a tí" (singular) and "Gracias a vosotros" (plural), which is a bit formal but not uncommon
I don't think there is a general rule for the whole country, it will depend more on each teacher
In my case the general rule was that we read at least two books per term, we chose which book and when we finished we had to make an oral summary for the teacher, because in the written essays it is easier to make a copy and paste from the internet
That was the norm for all four years of high school (12y-16y or so), but in the last two years we did have some required books
* Don Quijote, Cervantes
The summarized version adapted to current Spanish, a piece of shit
* Lazarillo de Tormes, Anonymous
* Platero y yo, Juan Ramón Jiménez (poetry)
* Legends, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer
* Meow, Benito Pérez Galdós.
* La Celestina, Fernando de Rojas
* The House of Bernarda Alba, Federico García Lorca (theatre)
Those are the ones I can remember
I was also forced to read Le Petit Prince, but in philosophy class, not literature
I think it was the only mandatory foreign book
Don Quixote, the song of Mio Cid, Lazararillo de Tormes
There were more, but these are the only ones i remember
There are no mandatory books, simply each teacher choose the books the class must read
I had to read two books by Galdós on the same year
I'm a bookworm but man, just couldn't finish either (Marianela and Trafalgar)
Also had to read La Celestina that same year, in ancient Castillian
It was a fucking nightmare
There are rules that apply to the whole country, with some variations depending on the region
Why did you read a summarised version of El Quijote AND in modern Spanish
Were you in a "special" class of some kind
Lol
God, Tirant lo Blanc was a torture, I was an avid reader back then and it was the first book I really had problems reading
I remember also reading Mirall Trencat and Nada during Bachillerato
They change the curriculum every few years
I guess my teacher, who was one of my favourite teachers and was really involved in encouraging reading and helping us to find genres and books that we really loved, opted for that version bcs he dont want yo spend the whole year with one book
In general, El Quijote in old Spanish is not very attractive when you are 14 years old
In retrospect, I don't think I would have enjoyed reading it out of obligation as a teenager as much as I enjoyed reading it a few years later, nor would I have appreciated its descriptions and humor (I laughed a lot reading it)
I think if I had been forced to read it, I would have hated it as much as I hated all the others
I guess that makes sense
But I still can't help feeling that simplifying it to the point of not even reading it in Old Spanish is dumbing it down too much
Maybe they could try making us read selected episodes, rather than the whole book
In any case, if your teacher's strategy did encourage people to read, that's always a good thing
Excluding basic stuff / things I actually need:
STUFF I USE A LOT:
- My computer
I spend 12h+ every day on the computer, both for work and free time
- My tablet
I don't use it much in daily life, but it's pretty basic while travelling
I travel sans-internet so I have all the screenshots of maps I need, all the information about places, transportation, I send emails to family, etc
In daily life I also use it as an ereader
- My camera
For travel, but I also have a youtube channel, so I use it every week for that + side projects every now and then
STUFF I LIKE:
- A vertical computer mouse
It does wonders for avioding carpal tunnel syndrome
- My pillow + blanket
I have x4 pillows (I typically only sleep with x2, one for the head, one for the hugging, but sometimes I go for 3-4) and multiple layers of blankets
I like to be as comfortable as possible when sleeping and take my bed very seriously
It's heaven
STUFF I DON'T USE, BUT I WOULD BE SAD TO LOSE:
- My teddies
- A daruma doll
The idea with daruma dolls is that they have empty white eyes, you're supposed to draw one of the eyes and ask for a wish and then draw the other one when the wish comes true
The problem is that I bought the doll when I had depression and I wished that I would "feel safe one day". It was 3 years later until I actually got over the constant sense of dread and would've been able to draw in the second eye
But I decided to leave it empty
Seeing the empty eye serves as a reminder that even if things might be bad one day, they can improve
I will add the rest when I think of them
Internet access is considered a basic right, so I only need a (good) PC
&#x200B;
I am a very basic person with no special needs
My computer, my phone (I don't like it that much, but I'd have to stay in communication with family and friends), a yoga mat, a good book worth reading more than once, pencils and drawing paper
I'm struggling to think of anything more, I guess I don't need that much to keep myself entertained
If it was a short trip or I wouldn't be able to stay for too long in each part of the itinerary, then just clothes, money and the basic stuff (toothbrush, etc
Excluding basic things like food and water
Pen/pencil and paper (notes, drawings, etc)
A camera
A musical instrument (can be small)
Phone + earphones
Multi tool knife
My laptop, I make a living off it
Cigarettes
Toothpaste and toothbrush
A great book or books
Beer
1/Phone+charger~who doesn't? It can do almost everything
The most radical change in travel in the last 20 years might have been the Phone
It has changed everything, from how you move, to how you inform yourself
2/mountain Boots~one of my musts when traveling, i walk quite a lot and anything else gets worn down rather fast
3/raincoat~i'm very much coldblooded so a good raincoat IS a must
4/backpack~ selfexplicatory
5/headphones+earphones~ apart from listening to music, they come in handy while traveling, want to set an alarm without waking everyone Up, just put your earphones before going to sleep
6/soap~travel essential
Small, increadibly usefull and It lasts for decades
7/Notebook+pencil~ i scribble on and about everything, i've finished theorem proofs on toilet paper because i had nothing else, so it's pretty much a necessity
8/wallet~ i'm pretty forgetfull so having an ordered set of things is important to me, my Wallet IS the first of them, It has almost everything i need on the day to day and all my attention IS focused on It
Of course while in travel i store the most important documents elsewhere
I don't like having a phone either, ideally I'd not have one but it's pretty hard to forego it altogether (for communicating with coworkers in tech emergency situations, having a bank account, etc
, that sort of thing)
I recently switched from movistar to simyo though, I pay 2€/month for calls and basic internet and I'm glad that I don't have to put more money into something I don't even want or use
I'm trying to think whether I can abandon it when I move to New Zealand
I looked it up and I don't find them very cute, even with the eyes painted on
Here are some [daruma dolls]
I personally use *Realpolitik* somewhat often, but it's not like it's a common word in Spanish
I can't think of a German word that we use regularly
I can think of a couple of words of German origins, partially adapted to Spanish, like "delicatessen" or "leitmotiv".
> Regarding English loan words in German there is a very paradox phenomenon of "fake-English". German basically invents English words or just misuses them, a very famous example is the word "handy" for mobile phone
We have that too
For example, for some reason, instead of jogging we say "footing".
>Regarding English loan words in German there is a very paradox  phenomenon of "fake-English". German basically invents English words or  just misuses them, a very famous example is the word "handy" for mobile  phone
We also do that by adding -ing
For a really long time everyone said "footing" instead of running
About loan words from German, we have a few, although not as many as from French or English or Greek: leitmotiv, obús, zepelín, vals, hamburguesa, cuarzo, delicatessen, hámster, búnker, zeitgeist, etc
We do also have many words that come from ancient Germanic languages, mainly Gothic because of the Visigoths, but those aren't really that related to modern German
Coche (car) came from german i think
we have a lot of visigothic words like yelmo, guardia, guerra, tapa
Hámster, hamburguesa, vals, cuarzo o feldespato are also *germanismos*
lol same, we have some secret special words, you don't know but the grammar is cool though
In Spain it's socially acceptable and it has become pretty common these days
For example, our Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Rights Pablo Iglesias used to wear a ponytail, but nowadays he wear a bun
Many people often make jokes about his hairstyle, but it's more about political issues than esthetic
Fairly common in young people
Not the best imagte you want if you work in a high status place, to be honest
My hair used to be long, and the only problems I had were with my parents
Spanish 2nd vice president
(Yes there are 3 vice presidents-PM
Only hipsters and heavy metal people uses it in Spain
Just far right people make fun of it, most people just don't care
Even my brother in law has really long hair
Yes but usually they wear it tied up in a bun or a ponytail, at least from what I've seen, or a hair band
Oh no, it's not
I had to cut my hair to find a job some years ago
That is serious
It also happened that walking in the streets I suffered life threats from skin heads
Spain is no tolerant with it, unless you are a Roma Gallardo or some bullshit maleist in the right wing
I'm not sure it's socially acceptable or common quite the way you phrase it
In fact, I'd consider it specifically uncommon, and something that you'd mostly find among certain categories of generally younger people
Not that those people would see themselves particularly affected, as their social circles probably wouldn't mind it, but it's still not something that would be appropriate everywhere in Spain in all contexts, and especially not one that's common across the board
On the other hand, we Spanish women tend to tear out hair down most of the time
If it's too hot or exercising I will tie it up, but otherwise
\- Mantis
\- Mantis religiosa
\- Santa Teresita (Little Saint Theresa)
Similar in Spain, they’re called "mantis religiosa" (Religious Mantis)
In spanish
How = Como
And the question in spanish is
¿Como le llamais a x...?
Literally "How do you call x...?
"Mantis religiosa" in Spanish
I would say that the most famous Spanish song is [Gran Vals] by Francisco de Tárrega even thought most people who hear it don't know it is it
And there was a dark time when [this song] was an international hit
I knew it in the 90s as an antifascist theme, covered (translated and adapted) by a Spanish left-wing rock band called Boikot
However they named the song after the Spanish civil war republican side slogan "[No pasarán] (They shall not pass) and mixed with a popular republican song after the civil war [siege of Madrid]
Most people knew it was an adaptation
For those who didn't get it or didn't click the link, [the famous Nokia cellphones ringtone is an excerpt from Gran Vals by Francisco de Tárrega]
Los Pajaritos is an Spanish adaptation from Der Ententanz by Werner Thomas composed in 1957
I woulnd't say is a Spanish song since it was translated in many languages
For locals, I'd say [Paquito el Chocolatero] by Gustavo Pascual Falcó is one of the most popular folk songs in Spain since the 30's. [Here] you can see a whole stadium singing it in a soccer match
[Rosalía] is pretty famous right now too
Wasn't she the first singer to win a Grammy without singing in English or something like that
Nope, they "sing" in spanish (kind of) but they're French
That's Puerto Rican, not Spanish
That we have a lisp, that we are moors and that we are mexicans
That we are lazy and we are thieves and we don't like to work
That we listen to Lola Flores and dance flamenco all day
That all of us sleep from 14:00 to 17:00
When someone asks if you've ever seen snow or they don't actually know there are 4 seasons here, too
That we are lazy
Whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night
This is a very widespread thought in Spain and I hate it
All the Romanians I know are really nice and hardworking  people
But definitely, leaving food on a plate is way worse
Also, assuming we are an underdeveloped, violent country because wE sPeAk MeXiCaN when we got a higher HDI than Italy and France and our crime rate is amongst the lowest in Europe
Just be careful when you use the balcony ok
Terrorists jokes are a thing also in Spain with the Basque Country
You do isn't? Iran is a Middle East country and a Islamic Republic so
I didn't know I was romanian
pero esos son todos ciertos
ademas i think thats a spanish way of thinking
europe doesnt understand why we would be thieves or lazy or about lola flores (fuck idek who she is) the flamenco and nap part maybe and also that we have a lisp
This and Fichtl's lied are the reason why I don't trust German music
That's true but northern Spain has some cold winters
Mediterranean cities are way warmer but that happens in France, Italy, Greece
This winter has been warm so far, thou
It hasn't rained as much as it should, there hasn't been snow yet, but I think that's a trend through all Europe
The earth is getting warmer
Ciertamente en el norte creo que no, de otros sitios no puedo opinar porque no he estado lo suficiente en el sur
But you got some people from other UE countries or USA and it's like they watched all the Torrente movies before coming here and they think that's how it is you know
I was once asked if Canadians live underground because of the cold
I heard people from the north of Spain saying that Africa starts in the Ebro, so I guess it is similar
Thanks
Have a good day
Andalucians freak out if it dips below 10°C so I believe it
I know
I live in Málaga
Estás confundiendo vagancia con vaguedad/imprecisión...
Rewarded and protected for as long as you can foresee
The descendants of some of them are still in charge
Business, banking, politics, etc
Also they won the Spanish Civil War
They were proud, at least until 1975
Well,.. It's complicated
Free holidays
This shit is so frustrating
sigh
Believe it or not, we have no one better than the King to become the President of the Republic
It's a drama
Yes but no
Well lets say:
1939-1975 Considered heroes that fought against communists
1975-2004 Well, it was war, kind of neutral
2004-Now Not proud of participating in that war
I'd rather have Mr Borbon as an elected president than as a king
Even then, I don't buy into that
El Preparao isn't the only person capable of doing the job
And maybe we shouldn't trust that much someone whose family (his sister, his brother in law and his own father) has already been involved in corruption
No, thank you
How's your Spanish
Ok, how about Aznar
Rajoy, maybe
Díaz Ayuso
Rodrigo Rato
Espe Aguirre
Jordi Pujol
Xavier Arzalluz
Arnaldo Otegi
Let's hope for the new generation of politicians, but by now, no one in Spain is able to be President of the Republic
First of all, it depends on the type of republic
Presidential (US), semi-presidential (France) or parliamentary (Germany)
In the first two, the president is political and the head of government, so it would be whoever wins the elections
They're systems that work so I don't think we should dismiss them that quickly
If an hypothetical Spanidh republic was of the third type, I'd look into former presidents of the Congress who have done a good job and showed they can mediate the democratic process
I'm the opposite of a PP supporter, but Ana Pastor did a respectable job
I don't know about the previous ones because I didn't pay that much attention to politics back then
We should also consider independent candidates coming from the intellectual spheres, that could serve as a compromise among parties of different ideologies
[Spanish
Ana Pastor plays the moderate game and in the meantime belongs to Opus Dei
Ehmm
That's the opposite of my point
She might have whatever ideology she has, but that didn't condition her job
She's also friends with a gay Catalan nationalist former *conseller* and attended his wedding so she might not be s conservative as you think, but that's besides the point
Hmmm
They are equals
Some have as much level of independency or more as Switzerland
Some have their co-official languages which have been protected and promoted with the constitutional voting and subsequent national budgets
The main reason you and I are speaking in English right now is because we want to be understood by a broad audience
Following that same rule, in English, saying “castillian” is meaningless unless you are talking to a specific subset of people that actually know what it means (although I guess you could go around saying Spain-Spanish, but then we are back to square 1)
“Spanish” is in the curious position that no matter what you do, it’s problematic
If you call it Castillian, LatAm probably won’t like that (they sure as hell don’t speak Castillian, they speak Argentinian Spanish, or Mexican Spanish, or
), but if you call it Spanish, we are “discriminating our regional languages”. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
I personally, in general, use “Spanish” while speaking in English, and castellano in Spanish, unless I’m specifically talking about the dialect of Castille, or talking about the language as a whole, respectively
Spain is aconfessional
To be clear
The ones in charge of deciding if a language is ‘valid’ or not is said language’s containing territory
The only one who can decide if Estremeñu is a valid language to be taught in schools is not the central government, but Extremadura itself
The government’s official position is essentially “Castillian is the common language
Learn it
***However*** if a region considers a language important, then it is equally important as Spanish throughout that region
Learn it too
” (There might be a ‘bit’ of paraphrasing over there)
E: Something that’s not 100% clear to me is if enough people in, let’s say Murcia, speak Ionian Greek,  and wanted to make it an official language there, if they *could*
So what
That has nothing to do with the conversation
What would be the problem then
I am not for killing languages or cultural heritages except when they are against of the UDofHR or suppose a risk for future clean, air, soil and water resources
Animal's rights are strönk in me too
I wouldn't trust a member of Opus Dei as a President of the Republic, that person is not suitable for the job
> What would be the problem then
None
I’m just reiterating that, when it comes to languages, the one to blame for a language being “second-classed” is not the state
>  am not for killing languages or cultural heritages ***except***
I can’t think of any good reason to forcibly kill a language
If you relocate a population, the people should still be allowed to speak their original language, at the very least, amongst themselves
(*can* a language go against the udohr
Heritage
I’d rather not have an opinion xD (there are too many asterisks
A president of the Republic in this case would have no more power than the king does nowadays
They would only be figureheads that call for the closure of congress and new elections, presents a candidate for the president of the government after meeting with all parties, etc
Pastor being a member of Opus Dei didn't stop her from doing a good job as a president of Congress, why would it stop her now
Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't vote for her nor support her in any way, but she would be a respectable conservative candidate for the position as opposed to people like Casado or Ayuso
I sense we both agree if we exclude mu clumsy use of English
That's the key, there's no one respectable right now
Maybe Errejón.
Lots of them
I live in s region named Castile
Lots of them
Most castles in Spain are in ruins, but they have their charm and there's plenty
Well, I’m not really sure, but I’d say around 8-10 castles, between Spain, Romania and Italy
Pfff
Who knows
About 30 abroad, and 50+ here in spain
Probably more
We're plagued with castles and i for one LOVE them
If i had to count the ones i've seen It would be well over the 200
You just can't Drive across Spain without seeing a Castle
Every time i go up north i see a couple dozen
This IS wahta happened:
I read the question
I say out loud: Who would ask tha
HE'S AMERICAN RIGHT
Ok, he's American
There are two (massive) regions in Spain with a name that starts with "Castilla" (Castilla la Mancha and Castilla y León), which basically means they used to be full of castles during the reconquering of Spain, while the Christians in the north were fighting the caliphate of the south
They used to put castles everywhere to hold the land they were conquering
I'm guessing it was the same in Portugal
The only ones I remember are *murciélago* (bat) and *estadounidense* (citizen of the USA), but they're not really that short, there's probably a shorter one
There's "euforia" as well
Acuífero (aquifer
) is the first one that comes to my mind right after murciélago
Secuoia, the tree
But it's usual to write it as secuoyas
Acuífero is another one
There are two definitions of the word vowel
The ortographic one (letters) and the phonetic one (sounds)
I think in this discussion they are talking about letters
And "abuelito" (granddaddy), which I guess is cheating a bit as it's a derived word
I'm surprised I hadn't "euforia" ready, the rest I knew since childhood
And it's a favorite song
Secuoia doesn't appear on the RAE, so I guess that one doesn't count
I had a look online and there are tens of thousands of words with all 5 vowels in Spanish, but it seems that euforia is one of the shortest
As I told you, there are two definitions for vowel
You can find both in dictionaries
Is random drunk singing in buses normal in other european countries
When I went out to party in Spain we took a midnight bus that was absolutly packed of people also going to the party, and everyone was singing in unison random local songs (They sang queen at some point though) These people didn't know each other at all, they were just drunk
Does this tend to hapen in other places
That’s almost tradition in Spanish parties
Unless we are bothering people, of course
We trynna keep it civil
I think Spanish and Spanish speaking Latin Americans can understand both of us perfectly
Maybe some word may still be used there and here isn't and vice versa
But the difference is not too big
Maybe some really deep rural accent can be difficult to understand, but that's more rare to happen
Chilean is a bit difficult to understand sometimes but if they are in a casual / vulgar talk, they speak extremely fast and use some strange vocabulary sometimes
Even if we understand us, the differences in pronunciation and a bit in vocabulary makes us have two dubs, one for Latin America and one for Spain
Spanish from very rural areas of south american countries are a nightmare
But in spanish we share the RAE (royal spanish academy) which is an organization (one on each spanish speaking country) that comes together to make the dictionary and the rules of spanish, so if the speaker is educated enough (highschool educated) we understand without any problems
I wouldn't call it difficulties but when you travel to latin America there are some words or expressions that you either don't understand or have a different meaning
But its maybe 1 out of 30 words so you often understand by context or in 2 or 3 days you get used to those words
For example, coger in Spain is to pick up, in latam is to fuck, pararse in Spain is to stop, in latam is to get up
Sometimes yes for Spaniards, mostly Chilean people, but for example I have a friend from Perú
It's not just for Latin American, we sometimes don't understand people from other regions of our same country
Nah we understand each other in a 95%. A few words are different but nothing very important
Only if they have a really strong accent, but I usually don't.
Normally, no, although at first there might be a few words you can't understand
However for some more extreme accents (from example people from some small village) it can be harder
That said it can also be hard to understand Spaniards from certain areas with strong accents
I can't understand a few words of Chicano english and Mexican spanish since they're mexican slang but thats it, 99% of the words are the same and vowel phonetics dont change
Generally we understand them perfectly except for some vocabulary, but some dialects like the Caribbean ones (Puerto Rico, Rep Dominicana and Cuba) can be hard if you aren't used to them because of the accent and how fast they speak
I think Chilean being impossible to understand is kind of a meme because at least I personally can understand it
Then again, the same thing can be said about some dialects in Spain from some places of Andalusia
Not really, as a spaniard i can understand every latin quite easily
Obviously some idiomatic expressions are quite difficult, but i can mantain a fluent conversation with them :)
Only to add, that as I’m familiar with some local vocabulary in South America my only trouble would be when there is a Quechua or Mayan speaker that really doesn’t speak Spanish very well and their grammar and pronunciation is very dubious
That would happen if you go to parts of Guatemala, Bolivia, Perú.
Also, street slang from Mexico City in slums would be also difficult, but I guess it would be even difficult for Mexicans themselves
It is said that the accent from Murcia is impossible to understand
Lucky Murcia doesn’t exist
They have a very conservative dialect from Western France
It might be right to some extent and they protect French against English vocabulary while French in France has quite a lot
Like in France they would say le week-end and in Québec  they say fin de semaine
Venezuelan is easy in my opinion
Difficult ones are rural Chilean or some Caribbean speakers
Not really
As i said, every rural/isolated accent/dialect is hard
Educated people normally use similar words (as we all use the same dictionary/rules)
Venezuelan is extremly similar to the canarian accent for me, not very difficult
The RAE is not controlled by Spain
There is one in every spanish speaking country and they come together to make the dictionary and rules bases on how it is actually being spoken and used
That's the beauty of spanish
The original and oldest is in spain
What i mean is that tyey are not goverment officials
They choose their memebers and fund theirselves (via donations and dictionaries and books, etc)
Sin problema
La conjugación de vos es muy sencilla
Solo hay algunas expresiones o palabras específicas que a lo mejor me despistan
He visto muchas películas argentinas como siete reinas y no tienen dificultad
Very bueno
For Spain, I think either the Civil War (1936-1939) or the Transición (the restoration of democracy after the dicator's passing in 1975)
In my opinionare almost all major events since 1898 with cuba, puerto rico and filipinas + second republic + civil war + dictatorship + transicion democratica
i will say that first republic would be the one, that sets the infighting of the parites and the political turmoil that makes the 19 and 20 century a political turmoil that creates the situation for the civil war
well that model the spanish mentality from the 16 century to the 19 century but that mentality has litle to do with the actual one,
I don't think so, Civil War and the Transición are what really define the Spanish national identity
Nothing related to America
I'd rather say the conquest of America, and later for modern Spain the Civil War
Add in the Peninsular War too as a fundamental step in between
I wouldn't say the Reconquista has much importance in the actual national identity
It had its importante as America's discovery and the many wars we fought but those aren't present in most people from Spain today, Spanish Civil War, its legacy and the fear to a new civil war is mcuh more present
Paella, I can't deal with it
I like to eat rice
but *that*? No, sir
That's not my thing
Nothing, i hardly hate any food
If it's well cooked i like It
I love trying new foods so i've just gotten used to different flavours and textures
I think the shock of the new plays a central part on why people don't like certain foods
They make you feel uncomfortable and so you hate them
My experience has led me to believe that if you make an effort most food can be an acquired taste
I used to hate avocado, canned tuna and raw fish but with time i got over It and now i love the three of them
My brother over here hates salmorejo
It's similar to gazpacho, but thicker
For me, it's callos
And snails, for fuck sake
Te entiendo demasiado
Además que es la comida social comodín y nadie la sabe hacer que no sea un infierno de mover tropezones
How could you betray us like this bröther
Nooooo, how could you say smth so cruel
I lived a year in Ireland
they know there's other ways to prepare vegetables, right
You don't need to boil them till they fall appart
Estais locos, la paella bien echa es un must de los domingos
Aunque obviamente al ser valenciana juego con ventaja jajaja
I'm not joking if I tell you that if you live in France, Italy or Spain, being a picky eater is a legit reason to be an outcast
You're right, but many people don't like It, don't know why
Es que es eso: bien hecha
Y casi todo el que conozco es un montón de cosas sobre arroz amarillo
Happy cake day
I still shudder when i remember mushy boiled turnip
Grill or oven, both are delicious
Here we have a few dishes that just consist on that escalivada and pimientos del padrón for example
Wtf it isn't rare we do it in Spain and I think that also in Latin America
Exactly the same in Spain
Indoors or on the street
If the latter, same disgusting shit here
Not common but not that uncommon either, unfortunately
I read once about this sacred "personal space" between dudes
Picture the scenario where you're sitting on the couch with your friends, and there's not much room
Your legs are touching, right
Well, apparently American guys would think that's weird and would try to always keep a miniscule gap between their bodies
I read this in Reddit so it may be total bullshit
It's definitely a thing in Spain
I mean, if I don't have any tissues to throw up the snot I accumulated in my throat I'm going to spit it out
It may be disgusting but I'm not going to swallow that shit
It seems it is normal in France to kiss everybody everyday
- Madrid: [Museo del Prado]  [Reina Sofía]  and [Thyssen-Bornemisza]
- Bilbao: [Guggenheim]
- Valencia: [Ciudad de las artes y las ciencias]
- Figueres (Girona): [Museo Dalí]
- Barcelona: [MACBA]
- Málaga: [Pompidou centre]
- Murcia: [Salzillo museum]
Among many others, but I'd say these are some of the most famous (except for Salzillo museum which is not that well known
It's mainly Semana Santa sculpture from one of the greatest artisans, Francisco Salzillo)
[Arcade Vintage Museum] in Ibi (Ailcante) Spain
I can say 4 in Madrid: El Prado, el Thyssen, el Reina Sofía and MAN (Museo Arqueológico Nacional)
Never go to the Museo de Cera de Madrid unless you want to laugh
The Imperial War Museum, the HMS Belfast, National Gallery and the Natural History Museum are all amazing, and most of them really close to the British Museum
IMHO the amount and quality of museums is one of the things that amazed me the most as a tourist in London
While the Guggenheim Museum has been the iconic museum of Bilbao since its opening
The Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao (Bilbao Fine Arts Museum) is a jewel that I always recommend
I can't believe you forgot the [MAN]
Yesss
It's collection is small but so good
I mostly agree with you
The building is very unique
And as I said, it has become iconic and attracted many visitors to Bilbao
That has been quite good for the city (trust me, Bilbao did not look the way it does now; the museum has not been the only factor, but it has certainly helped),
I would recommend visiting the Guggenheim for the building itself
It is stunning
The inside depends a lot on the actual exhibitions
Some of the temporal art exhibitions have been excellent, some of them have been interesting, and some made me wonder what art is
I guess my tastes for art are a bit old-fashioned
There are KFCs in Spain but I have never been in one
I don't like battered/breaded meats generally speaking and I'm not fan of chicken meat (I only eat roasted chicken breasts)
There are some, but most people have never been there
Their fast food is too expensive; if you're willing to spend more money on your meal, there are a lot of fancier and healthier options here
The main reason people eat fast food is because it's cheap
I've never eaten in one, I think
Not as easy to find as the rest of fast food brands
I've seen a few of them though
It's more of a "we're next to a KFC might as well eat here", than the typical "let's go to Mcdonalds
I've never seen one
Apparently, there are less than 20 in the whole country
1KFC/15 million people
They're expanding fast
They plan to double the number of restaurants from 100 (mostly located in the largest cities) to 200 in a few years
I remember going a couple of times with friends
Nothing extraordinary, but it was fine
What caught my attention was that when I came to the US, a friend from Spain told me to never go to a KFC here, that it was way way worse than Spain
As expected, my curiosity got the better of me and tried
Go figure, he was right
Horrible, extremely dry meat
If that is the original chicken, I don’t get how it became a success
Agree
It's more likely to find it in large malls or big big cities, never in towns
nah, lots of kids even well into their 20's have no idea how to cook, wich might have to do with parents being overprotective or young people staying longer living with their parents than other countries (average age to leave your parents house is 29)
I'd say everyone can cook at least some basic stuff, I've lived in a shared apartment while I studied and apart from ordering food like once a week and eating pre-cooked meals once in a while, we all usually cooked for ourselves at least simple stuff
Same for all of my classmates back then
I guess Italy, we are not even close to them, but man, we get along really well
maybe Italy tbh
whenever there's an international party among students you'll always find italians and spaniards together by teh end of the night
many little things in common
Italy, definitely
I agree with everyone saying Italy and also Greece but I'd like to posit Argentina
Spaniards and Argentinians seem to get along really well and our accents are very similar
Argentinian singers have been popular here in the past too
Italy from the point of view of Spain is after Portugal our closest neighbor i think (France doesn't count because it's France you know)
Italy, Argentina, Chile
+1 to Italy
But we are actually not that far from each other
Menorca and Sardegna are "only" at 400km from each other
Madrid and Barcelona are actually further away from each other
Or as another example Catalonia to Tuscany is also closer than Catalonia to Galicia
Man has to meet other Men and Women then
I came to say the same
Since we share a border with France and Portugal, Italy is the obvious answer here
I'm usually pretty amazed when I read comments on this sub and it turns out that most Mediterranean day to day lifestyle is basically the same
Sometimes I even relate to greeks
Our way of living and thinking is extremely close and we share a lot of things (high value for family, high social activity, and a "Carpe díem" approach to life)
A lot of our customs are derived from roman times (Italy being the center of the empire and Hispania having three provinces, one of them being a senatorial province)
We are also heavily influenced by Catholicism, wich ties us togeter even closer
When I went abroad to study with people of other nationalities, the Italians and Spaniards were the first to get close and became friends
For some reason this is a misconception I've seen elsewhere
We have a lot of things in common, after all: Romance Mediterranean countries, loud and cheery people, glorious past and shitty present, good food, overrun with tourists, wild political landscape, corruption
Never heard that
Spain and Italy are very similar
Why do you think that
I'm curious
A lot of years ago (talking here 40-50 years) italians looked down on us but honestly, we get along pretty well
Lots of commom little things
And between spanish and frenchs, and germans and frwnchs, and english and french etc
You're also forgetting the whole part of hubbie Netherlands treating Belgium as inferior and restricting her freedom
One of my dreams is to meet with an Italian and try to have a conversation, but talking on our own languages, so we can try to see how much we understand each other
I think that we won't understand each other as much as I'd expect, because when I went to Portugal it was more difficult than it seemed, but I'd still love to try
I’ve had lengthy conversations where I spoke exclusively in Spanish and my interlocutor spoke exclusively in Italian and both could keep up as if it was a normal conversation
As long as no one talks too fast it’s doable
Podría funcionar
Es muy curioso
Es cierto
Porque con el portugués el francés, catalán y gallego me ocurre lo mismo
Siempre es más fácil leer
Cuando la conversación es hablada y no escrita, la pronunciación lo transforma todo demasiado, y se vuelve más difícil
Yo también estudié francés cuando estaba en el instituto y me pasaba lo mismo que a tí.
Qué maravilla
Te dejo tranquilo, que ya es tarde y hay que descansar
Muchas gracias y buenas noches
Buona sera
The damn -e's for femenine lmao
Fairly similar to Barcelona, fairly dissimilar to like Castrillo de la Reina, Burgos (185 inhabitants)
I haven't been there in a while but generally people aren't overly concerned with that and just live their life with some political discussions from time to time
Is the christmas national lottery a thing/tradition in your country
I'm from Spain, and the christmas lottery is a tradition I would say in most families
Is it a Spanish thing, or does it happen in your country too
I saw this question and thought "this is a question asked by a spaniard"
Someone said that he thought this question is silly bcs there is a new year s lottery in almost every country, and then delete it
If you re anywhere, my friend, perhaps a little more context was missing
The day of the Christmas lottery in Spain (december 22) is an important day, everyone puts the TV or radio on to follow the draw all morning
There is a lot of ceremony around the lottery
It takes place in a theater, with an audience, and the balls with the numbers of the draw are taken manually by the children of the San Ildefonso school, which in the past was a school for orphans
The children of San Ildefonso train very hard to "sing" the numbers, and their way of doing it is very recognizable (especially when they sing 1,000 euros, which is the most repeated price)
Instead of having a few big winners, the prizes are widely distributed and for days the news travels around the country visiting the winning locations and the lucky ones
Usually tickets are shared with family, friends, co-workers
the slogan of the draw is "the important thing is to share", meaning that the important thing is not to win the prize but to share it with our loved ones
The aim of the lottery isnt to make someone a millionarie, but to help many (especially to our Minister of Finance)
And of course there is the TV spot, which more than an spot is usually a short film that tries to move us and make us shed some tears (although there have also been very bad ones)
Fck off Santa, long live Lottery Bald Man
How big are the prizes
In Spain's Christmas Lottery, the big prize (El Gordo) is 3,000,000 € per number, which is to say 300,000 € per winning ticket
Wait, really
What do they say about it
Really
Every year
This looks the perfect moment to sit warm and comfy in the coach next to your hole family while watching the bingo and eating ham
That sounds really fun
we know our own
Oh that’s interesting, how did it even get over there
This is incredibly surprising
They make my eyes sweat every year :')
Would love to try that
Same kind of ads here hahaha
Merry xmas
what happened
that is some dark shit
Well our lottery is national, meaning it’s state run
I get it’s a waste of money (we call it the tax of the fools), but by no means is it a scam, plus the tradition around it is nice, and there’s always a small chance you make some money out of it
Afaik the christmas one is more likely to pay back than the other lotteries, so it’s not really the same experience
Not OP but yeah its a big deal
Even people that don’t usually play lottery will buy a ticket for this
Tickets start selling super early, as early as July I think, and if you procrastinate and wait to buy them at the last minute there are big queues at the shops that sell them
My parents don’t really buy lottery tickets throughout the year, but I asked them after seeing this post “do we have any tickets for tomorrow
”. Without any context they knew exactly what I was talking about haha (we do have tickets btw
Yes, except that one year with the 4 riders of the apocalypse singing
Holy crap
It the first time I heart about this, really surprising
It's not a thing we know in Spain
sign of things to come
No big deal, regular Spanish lottery has much bigger prizes at much cheaper tickets than Christmas lottery, which is even more absurd than the sole lottery concept
In Spain they are 20 euros per ticket
A ticket is one tenth of a series, which is a part of a number
So, for 20 euros you can get 300,000 euros
If I understand it correctly, in the NL you can get 30 million for 30 euros if you win
Thanks for sharing, really fun
By what I could see in the video, as you are able to choose the number and you can participate from 5€... Most probably they aren't official Spanish lottery tickets (you can choose the number in Spain but tickets are sold only in 20€ increments)
Probably the agency handles it as a regular "bet" in that agency, so it's technically a parallel game tied to the numbers of "El Gordo". Still funny to learn that there are people playing abroad
It happens also in Spain, there are lots of organizations making parallel games, including bars and restaurants that sell 100 tickets for winning a prize (e.g. a big basked with lots of gifts such as TVs, laptops, ham legs, etc
, but the most common is to have some christmas food in a fancy presentation)
As they are 100 numbers only, you win the price if your ticket number matches the two last numbers of the "Gordo" number
Just a typo, thanks for spotting it
I was interested in the prize amount in order to compare
With the Gordo you cannot simply retire and enjoy your winnings
With the Dutch prize you actually can
The possibility of winning El Gordo is 1/100,000, in case you are interested
There are quite a lot of winners
1 1st prize (a number, which is composed of 10 series, and each series divided into 10ths, which is what people actually buy); 1 2nd category prize; 2 3rd cat prizes; 4 4th cat prizes; 6 5th cat
For each prize there are 100 winners (as explained)
As far as I can remember, there are up to 1720 possible winners of the 300
000€ prize
70% of the collection is returned in prizes
Definitely it's gambling
In Spain, a 1/10 costs 20€ and it's already a official ticket, the full ticket costs 200€. They could be buying the real tickets to back up your bet and charging you a rather big fee for that, but I don't think that's the case as they allow you to choose between the 100,000 possible combinations rather than from the numbers they could have in custody
We also have non-official smaller fractions but they are often issued by other organizations that have the real number in deposit and sell tickets for raising funds
The tickets must be clear on what's your participation in the official ticket (e.g. [ this is the Spanish Association Against Cancer and they seem to shell 3€ tickets, 2
50€ for the lottery and 0
50€ as a donation for the organization)
Nop, there are 172 "series" of a number, not 10
In Spain the probability of getting the price of the ticket is 10%. But there are many prizes along the way
Overall it seems like the Netherlands it's the better deal, but with less chance of winning big
Thanks for the correction
I haven't bought a ticket in over 10 years, that's why I don't remember it well
I think we have a better deal, but say so to the winner
It's true that the biggest prize is rather low, but there are a lot  of winners of the main prize (usually with bigger prizes only one ticket gets it), also there are a lot of smaller prices
: Having a great talk with a pizza restaurant owner, and remembering the first time I crossed a country border
: Boating along in the Vaporetto with some good friends
: Watching the apes just play together next to me, so close you could even touch them (please don’t try that)
Yeah I have not traveled much
Portugal: Chilling by a swimming pool with a friend while drinking Sprite
Uk: Visiting the imperial war museum (god save the queen)
France: Idk, visiting Disneyland I guess
Belgium: Watching memes about article 13 in front of the european parliament
Netherlands: Spending the day in Amsterdam doing what you usually do visiting a city
wow this is gunna be a long one
England- Lived here as a student and have too many memories to count
I'd say the one that stands out is my first visit to the country, spend New Years with a friend on Primrose Hill in London and then went out to some pubs in Camden after
I had never been to the UK before so it was a nice introduction
Ireland- Went with an Australian friend to Dublin for a weekend, don't remember much because we were 2 pissed up 20 year olds
I remember the Guinness storehouse being really cool
I have to go back to Ireland and see it properly
Scotland- Went with same Australian friend to Edinburgh
We went whisky tasting which felt very educational to me at the time
I remember trying on suits of armor near Edinburgh Castle as well
Wales- Took a day trip to Cardiff with an ex girlfriend and we had a really nice day walking around the city and seeing the Castle
Portugal- Met some friends in Porto for a weekend where we did all of the classic tourist things - wine tasting, eating incredible food, and seeing all of the architecture
Spain- I have lived here for years, so that's hard
My favorite memory from before I lived here is going out to lunch with my friend's family in Alicante
They are quite well-connected in the city, and his dad is friends with some restaurant owners
Cue 4 hour long lunches with many bottles of wine on the Mediterranean beach front
France- I went on a "ski tour" with a friend's uni ski club for a week in Les Arc
I was the only non-brit in a group of about 150
We took coaches down from London, skied and partied our asses off for a week straight
Every night had a theme - one night was anything but clothing
We decided to wrap ourselves in duct tape - that hurt to take off
Denmark- Had a 12 hour layover once in Copenhagen, just explored the city with a friend who also happened to be there, ate good food and drank lots of beer
Belgium- Also had a long layover here
Ate lots of fries, drank lots of beer and was very disappointed by manneken pis
Netherlands- Spent a few days on the coast near Noordwijk with an ex girlfriend
The Dutch coast is very quaint
Germany- Spent a week there with an ex girlfriend's family
I met her in Frankfurt and we drove down the autobahn to her family's house near Stuttgart
It was August, lots of bbq's, hikes in the forest, and just nice german family time all around
This was during the London olympics, so we would sit around in the afternoons and watch some of the events
Switzerland- Same ex girlfriend lived in Lucerne for years
One day we took the boat around the Vierwaldstättersee and got off in some of the little towns - I remember Beckenreid, Fluelen, Gersau, Vitsnau
it was a really nice way to see some small swiss towns
Italy- Got hammered with my sister once in Rome and had second worst hangover of my life (see: Serbia)
Croatia- Spent a few days in an apartment on the coast outside Split with some friends
We bbq'd every night and drank lots of 2L bottles of beer
Albania- My friend and I met a German girl traveling the Balkans in her vintage VW bus in Berat
Convinced her to drive with us down to Sarande, google takes us down this stone/ dirt path through the Albanian Alps
6 nail-biting hours and 60km later we got onto a paved road in a small mountain town where we got scammed by some local mafia restaurant for lunch
Greece- Spent a few days in Athens on a trip around the Balkans
Saw all the sights, stuffed myself on souvlaki, and really enjoyed the vibe of Athens
I've seen some of the islands too, I had a really nice time in Kos
North Macedonia- Skopje is such a weird city
Couldn't get over all the new building and "fake" statues
Probably most memorable is eating dinner in the fake boat restaurant in the river
Kosovo- Stayed in the center of Prishtina and found some really nice little restaurants and bars in the city center
Serbia- Had train to Sarajevo the next morning at 8am, was going to stay in
Met some Australians, got hammered, chain smoked about 1000 cigarettes for some reason, ended up on a boat club in the Sava river until sunrise
Took a cab back to the hostel, slept 30 minutes, woke up feeling like ABSOLUTE hell
Threw up on the platform at the train station, got on the train and passed out
Got woken up as we crossed the border into Croatia, could not get back to sleep
Temperature was rising (July), got up over 35
We had no food, there was no food car
10+ hours of Serbian train in 35 degrees with no food and a brutal hangover
kill me
It's a great story now though
BiH- Was touring some of the olympic sites and while walking aroun some of the abandoned bob sled track in the mountains above Sarajevo the tour guide tells us "It's estimated that there's landmines up here every 15-20 meters, I could probably throw a rock and hit one
DON'T leave the bob sled track
Bulgaria- Visited Sofia in August, it was pretty slow since I guess everyone was on the coast for vacation
It was a nice relaxed city, but no significant memories
Romania- Drove around Transylvania with two girls we had met and saw Peles Castle, Bran Castle, and finished the day in Brasov
Really nice time, and gorgeous landscape and architecture
Hungary- Spent a week in Budapest with an ex girlfriend
It was January so we spent our time curled up inside, only going out for beers and food
It was a really nice cozy week in one of my favorite cities
Slovakia- I went to Bratislava by myself in 2011
Going up the Most SNP was probably the highlight
Ireland: my host brother and I playing with the PS4
France: camping with some friends
Italy: Visiting the Tuscany with my family
England: Harry Potter museum
Scotland: Buying a Scottish skirt
Germany: Mercedes museum at Stutgart
Monaco: Visiting the Casino
Portugal: I only went to the beach so
I guess that's it
Switzerland: Having a raclette at the hotel after skiing
Andorra: Visiting Andorra la Vella with my sisters
I think it is really cool that we have visited a lot of our countries, i really think it is amazing
Catalonia is on Spain tho
It's the good thing of Europe, we get to visit a lot of places in a few years
Never heard about him
Is there any film or book to which I can refer to
Edit, sounds like the German version of Pablo Escobar
Did Adolf built schools too
Oh yeah, he built even built especial housing for discriminated minorities
>I believe it’s the one with only one testicle
Ohhh yeah, you know that fascist dictator who seized power by slaughtering his political rivals in the 30s. You know the one, Francisco Franco
Well I think it would be quite obviously Catalonia since they have actually tried it a few times in history, the last of which quite recently
Edit: For people fighting over politics in the responses; I did not intend to originate discussion neither did I specify if I was in favor or against Catalonian independence
One piece of advice if you’re going to fight over this topic; don’t, it’s not worth it
Definitely Catalonia, as they already have been technically independent for 8 seconds
Galicia and the Basque country also have high chances, as the independent parties are very strong in their regional parliaments
What about French Guyana and those islands you have all around the world
What's the mood there
And the Basque Country, or even Galicia
But none of them are going anywhere
>do i really need to answer
Hey
I thought the same
Just imagine the Serbians
i think that Galicia is less likely than the other 2 but more likely that for say Leon
There isn't a real referendum supporting the idea of catalans wanting to secede
There was only one illegal and non-official poll with little participation where most of catalan people didnt vote, which means they dont really care, the separatists are the only ones making some noise
But Catalonia as a region def don't wanna secede from Spain, neither we want them to leave
Most who didn't vote didn't do it because it was illegal, not because they didn't care
I know some who would've voted yes but decided not to vote
Yeah
it looks really credible coming from a country who went to war over secession
honestly seen all the chaos that happens its normal to dont go
Well, not even the half of Catalonia voting means
that more than the half of Catalonia didnt vote, that most of catalan people didnt care about the referendum and that there are a quiet silent majority feeling spaniards
I understand what you want to see, it's your pov, but I wasnt wrong on my assumptions
Well
the thing is we also need Catalonia
Not only is it one of the economic centers of Spain it's also a right wing counterbalance
You just can't get rid of a region and call it a day
not in the US and not in Spain
>So it seems anachronistic to not allow secession
I'm sorry
do you know how many independentist movements there are
Because I think you underestimate the ubiquitous nature of the issue
But anyway, I also feel like having territories in the Caribbean is a bit anachronistic and that doesn't stop France, the UK, the Netherlands And the US from having them
If you want to know more details about the topic I'll give them, but I refuse to explain why a country wouldn't want a deeply engrained region to secede
I think it's pretty obvious
>In America it’s just assumed if California seceded no one would stop them
Except the constitution
for example
I think you have a very optimistic vision about the issue
There would be a terrible amount of problems with Californian secession
For example there's the fact that California doesn't actually own much of its territory
the coastline is part of the federal state and not the state of California
so would the new country have a coastline
What happens with federal property
What do you do with the thousands of homeless people in Los Angeles
most of which are from the now foreign US
Everyone is willing to give up the right to secession until it becomes a reality
just look at the UK trying to postpone the Scottish referendum
I'm tired of people holding a moral upper ground against us
when truth is most countries don't allow for seccesion and routinely have ignored calls for independence
Truth is no country wants their regions to secede
>Would Spain suffer economically if Catalonia were a depressed EU nation
Short answer: yes
Catalonia isn't just trying to secede from Spain but also get out of the EU in the process
Over 90% of Catalonia's exports are with the EU about 75% with Spain
Independence would most surely mean economic collapse for Catalonia and a really big hit for spain
And then there's the re-entrance:
Entering the EU ain't easy and the Schengen area is even harder and that's when there's no bickering
Ask Romania which got denied because the Netherlands feared droves of Romanians would emigrate to western Europe
Macedonia had to change its name to even get on the negotiation table
Croacia gave coastline to be in the EU
We had to weaken our production to not damage the french agricultural sector
Just imagine the situation for an lndependent Catalonia
It's ludicrous to think they would enter the union
Because what they want is to be richer and that's just not going to be the case
Catalonia has right now a priviledged situation in Spain
after independence they won't because it's no longer in the interest of the government to defend Catalonia's interests
>Ok I know this is almost off topic but where did you get the idea that the Feds own the california coastline
Look it up
they do
Most western states have a lot of federal land including California
The Californian coast is federal land
>It would be more like an extremely complicated Brexit
Hahahahahahaha
Brexit has already been extremely complicated
Separating the US and California would utterly destroy California
For example: they wouldn't have fresh water nor electricity
I'm not an economist but I'm pretty sure California would immediately go bankrupt
>legislature of California political prisoners
The Spanish constitution is very clear: secession is not allowed
They knew it and they went with an ilegal referendum
It is a crime, it's constitutionallly so
If California declared independence they would be on the same situation
because as I've already said secession is also illegal in the US and constitutionally so
I don't like the idea of political prisoners either, but they went against the explicit orders of the government
At the very least it's an embezzlement of public funds
>I did look it up to make sure
Almost my entire state is federal land
And most of california
But only tiny bits of their coastline
I meant the coastal **waters** ;)
>Only the UK clearly would handle it better
Well the UK is trying to impede a second LEGAL referendum
so I'm not that sure
There's also Ireland
which historically has been the weak point of Britain
Nothing like bringing a tank to the public stadium during a match or having an effective warzone in the middle of Belfast
>Spain handled Catalan very very poorly
The whole situation is a fricking disaster
In both sides
Tbh I can see a catastrophe happening just on account of negligence
And about the political prisons part
yeah, but Tejero was also a political prisoner
These political prisoners swore to upheld the constitution, it's part of their job
there are constitutional methods to change the constitution
They completely ignored them and instead used public money to held a referendum whose proposition is ilegal
Imagine if the governor of Alabama made a referendum to reinstate slavery
(I know it's morally completely on another league, but judicially it's equivalent)
>IMO it should take a supermajority (say 2/3) for a secession
In which case certainly Catalan and Scotland wouldn’t be allowed to secede
But like that’s just my opinion man
That's my opinion too
>What Britain is doing is fair since like it you just poll every year eventually you’ll get a yes
Yeah you're right but there is a legal debate, because the referendum is supposed to happen every generation **UNLESS** the situation drastically changes
hmm
guess what drastic change has happened since the last referendum
That's right BREXIT
>It’s what ten years until you can say it’s a new generation
I think it was 25-30
let's say Scotland is not "thrilled"
When I was in Greece I was shocked too
Here there are many stray cats, but that's all I would say
In my hometown there is a park that is full of cats everywhere
Nope
Here its really weird to find a stray dog, and most of times they are taken to the animal shelter immediately
There are way more stray cats, but they are not usually a problem, as they've learned to live with us
Some of them even allow you to pet 'em
Not at all, I've never seen a stray dog and there's some colonies of stray cats but they're usually controlled and feed by  associations or the city council and from time to time sterilized
What ink colour is the favourite/most used in your country
In Spain it is blue ink, but I personally prefer it black
What about you and your country
***P.D.: for clarification, I refer to pen ink and that kind of stuff
***
A friend of mine used to work at a notary's office in Spain and blue ink was strongly encouraged to avoid real signatures being confused with photocopied ones
It's common in Spain to invite the parents, usually mostly family and some friends
Kids play with their cousins and friends and parents drink coffee and chit chat
There are no elaborated organized games like in American birthday parties, we just let the kids roam
We usually don't give a lot of presents either and they are opened on the spot as they bring them
One thing that shocked me about America is how important it is opening the presents in front of everyone at the end as something to show off
I think it is very present-oriented
It's common in parties for children, but not to take care of them, but to share the work with the host and having some chit chat
Spanish moms (fathers not that much) usually befriend the moms' of their children's classmates
Once the kids are old enough to throw the party themselves, no parent will be nearby
Same in Spain (at least when I was a child)
Parents drop off their children and then come back to pick them up when the party is over
I guess it depends on the type of birthday
If it's only a few friends staying at the birthday kid's house, then the parents just drop their kids and leave, but when it comes to big parties (which are usually held at a venue where I'm from because almost everyone lives in apartments) it's kind of unfair for only a couple of parents to keep an eye on every single child while carrying on with the party at the same time
Usually the parents hang together but also keep an eye on the children and help the hosts with whatever they need
Yes, here it is very common for parents to attend birthdays too, although it is not usually an obligation, if they have something to do, they take the children to the party, congratulate the birthday boy or girl and leave
This happens from kindergarten to primary school (10-11 years old) more or less
Once they start high school they obviously become more independent
My experience regarding the organisation of birthdays is different from u/colako's. I was a child in the nineties and, I don't know if it was a local phenomenon, but mothers worked hard to organise games, yinkanas and piñatas to keep us entertained
I haven't been to many children's birthdays lately, but they were all at venues that specialised in birthday parties, with ball parks and that sort of thing
Maybe it was that my parents and family were not very educated
Is it common to study some of the dialectical differences of your language across regions
Does the educational system in your country give any time to the minor dialect differences of the way your language is spoken across regions
Here in Spain for instance we may study briefly the different Spanish dialects inside Spain itself, or even a bit of the differences with latino variants
We studied the differences among the different Catalan dialects, but I don’t remember ever having studied anything about the different Spanish dialects
Maybe its only a thing in Galicia
Can other spaniards confirm
Well, I studied regional "leismo" and "laismo" and some other differences such as c/s/z pronunciations in Catalonia but I recon we do focus more in Catalan dialects than we do with with the Spanish ones
Maybe Spanish has too many dialects
We did study regional accents a bit: Andalusian, the Canaries, Galician and also remember a bit from Extremadura and Madrid too I think
Either way it wasn't much, at most two or three lessons
Which one is the standard (British) English
This post refers to dialects, not languages
In Spain we study the separate languages in the respective regions, but im referring to different dialects of the main language
In Madrid we took a look at it but it wasn't particularly deep, at least seven years ago they did
I'm from Canarias, and for this trimester we have a project to analyse the 7 most popular dialect in Spain, including origins and the way they differ from basic castellano
It's worth about 30% of this trimesters grade so I'd say they take it quite seriously here atleast
It's also a thing in Asturias
I confirm but also from Galicia
I remember studying the different dialects in Galicia (the isoglosses was it
) during high school and bachiller, and only a brief look at the rest of the country and other Spanish speaking countries for like only a day or two
I studied in Madrid and was taught about dialectal variations, and the so-called Central-Northern Peninsular norm and Atlantic norm regarding pronunciation
It was in the 90's
I studied it in Castilla-La Mancha
Here in Valencia we study the different Catalan dialects, from Gerona to Alicante, including the variants in the Valencian Community (although there still are discussions about the language)
About Spanish dialect we only study something basic like the seseo and the ceceo
Apparently I'm the odd one out but I don't think we ever discussed that kind of thing in class
At most it was probably mentioned in the textbook but I don't think it was ever brought up, definitely not to the level of detail some other Spaniards are sharing (bloques dialectais, 7 most important dialects, etc
I took my entire education in Madrid, and I did the Humanities itinerary too
I'm pretty sure we didn't cover it because I've always been into that sort of stuff so I would've taken notice
i dont remember studying this
we just study how to clasify the dialects but nothing more
\-Castellano Leones here of Valladolid-
I'm from Barcelona but was schooled in Extremadura
We did study other dialects (especially castúo obviously) as well but sadly we didn't even bother learning about our own local language
Most schools in Galicia dont say anything about portuguese besides for "it used to be the same language than galician" and some medieval literature in galician class
I heard of one school that gives portuguese as an option to learn but its super rare, even tho the language is so close to us
We study some medieval literature from "galego-portugues" and stuff like that, but thats it
Alfonso X of Castille for instance, thought of Galician as the language of poetry and songs and published Cantigas de Santa Maria in Galician, but at the same time thought of castillian as the language of officiality and state documents
>We study some medieval literature from "galego-portugues"
Galaico-portuguese literature is also taught in Cantabria because it's relevant to Spanish literature as a whole
And also that damn poem in mozarab that popped up everywhere:
¿Que fareyo o qué serád de mibi
¡Habibi,
non te tolgas de mibi
It kinda looks like a weird mix of Catalonian, Portuguese and Arab
[Serranito] sandwhich
It consists traditionally of grilled porkloin or chicken filets (pounded very thin), cured jamon iberico, tomato slices, and a fried green pepper served on firm bread with olive oil
The pepper is the kind sometimes called Italian pepper, not bell peppers or any other types with thick flesh
These are popular as fair food in Andalucía.
[English Wikipedia]
Jamón with tomato and olive oil
Half of a sandwich made with two triangular slices of bread
Between the slices of bread are lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and a few slices of both ham and bologna, as noted by the Heavy
It is topped with a green pimento-stuffed olive pinned to the Sandvich by a toothpic
Lettuce, mayonnaise, sliced cheese and sliced tomato
Easy, cheap and tasty
Ham and cheese
The best thing I have ever seen
Mediterranean cuisine all the way
That is still my favourite
It is important too to use a good bakery bread and not the white sandwich bread that English use in their sandwiches all the time
Why would a republic ever want to be a monarchy again
What would they gain
Except that monarchs are people with inevitable political leanings and tend to favour the status quo (beyond political parties) and haven't historically been a barrier for authoritarianism (as seen by Spain and Italy in the past or nowadays Thailand)
Not to mention how the characteristics of such position can end up with monarchs and relatives taking advantage of their power and social influence
That a monarch is an avatar of the nation is more than arguable and in many cases not desirable because many people prefer not to give some dude a political position for life and all kinds of privileges because they were born in the proper family in the proper order with the excuse of being "an avatar". There are no theoretical nor practical benefits of having a monarchy in a democratic country
Developed, stable and wealthy nations are like that for a myriad of many different reasons unrelated to monarchism
If Sweden would become a republic it wouldn't stop being stable, wealthy and developed just like neighbouring Finland
It depends
Do I get to choose the part of Germany
If yes then the answer is Germany
If the answer is no I would choose Austria (prices in Switzerland aren't good for my blood pressure)
Germany because its the only country I know, but all seem very attractive
having really good living standards make me choose germany just because i would see the sea
Switzerland for paying less taxes and better jobs
Southwestern Germany without any hesitation
Reading the comments I'd say Renfe it's not as expensive as I thought it was
I study 500km away from home and every time I take the train (AVE, Euromed and commuter train) it costs me each way around 30-50€ and takes 7h, and I have only experienced significant delays in commuters
Some routes are maddenly expensive, however
Renfe's model is to juice the profitable routes to subsidise the others, and so routes like Madrid–Barcelona are really expensive, especially booking the same day or week
Often, if the city has an airport, it'll be cheaper to fly, but if it's a smaller place without an airport, then trains ought to be expensive compared to buses, etc
but not unaffordable
I just wish the mainline routes could be cheaper, however
It's very cool that we have such an extensive high speed network (most high‐speed rail in km in Europe
), but it's a pity that it's expensive to use to get between the main cities unless you book far in advance
But it really is fast, comfortable, and overall good
It lines up with what I know
I'd say cercanías in Madrid is around that price, 6€ for 60km (not counting season tickets)
That is unless you're young and from Madrid in which case they might as well let you in for free
20€/30 days, all public transport included
In my case that's 120km per 1€
Let's see how the new high speed low-cost AVLO works out
No, due to covid they now give a small bottle of hydroalcoholic gel and some santizing wipes
EVA was such a better name though
You could pick up Madrid and move it to the middle of the Atlantic and the government wouldn't even notice
[Tales of Count Lucanor] a medieval collection of tales where a count asks his advisor how to solve a series of problems and he answers telling a story with a moral
Aside from a bit of values dissonance, we had to read it in medieval Castillian, which was difficult
Tirant lo Blanc
Reading medieval literature (1490) is always hard, specially if it's not even in your dialect
They made you read quijote in old spanish
No wonder it was a drag
I had to but in a modern edition
I kinda enjoyed it
With *Don Quijote* do you mean only the first part
I liked Mecanoscrit del segon origen, it has teenage sex, that's always nice when you are 15 years old
I should read it again as an adult
That's actually a good book imo
A catalan friend told me that old and new catalan aren't that different (for some reason it had changed a lot less) sobitbwasn't that different but old spanish
Holly fuck that's boring
*La verdad sobre el caso Savolta* is unironically the best obligatory lecture we had
Heck, even people in my class who didn't like to read were theorizing about it in their free time, which is just wow
You are doing the Lord's work
"Servidor" was a word almost extinct, it meant servant, and it was a less used synonym of "sirviente". But nowadays "servidor" is a server in computers
So it is used again but with a different meaning
Did it fall out of use because of the SS motto
Meine Ehre heißt Treue "*My honour* is *loyalty*"
I went to the UK expecting rain everyday
It only rained like one day out of 7
Totally unacceptable
Unacceptable
I never stoo on pedestrian walks
In rome they are all maniacs
I swear to god i feared for my life every time i went into a taxi
We don't get enough sleep
That's our secret
That's how we party until 7 am
Our schedule is fucked up right from our birth
Nothing personal but
flair checks out
It was London and I think it was around May
But we invented siesta to compensate for our bad sleep
I swear to god
Like drivers were driving at 80 km/h in those narrow streets and like mounting on the tram's like platform all the time
Taxis were quick and thus, cheaper
But almost nobody takes a siesta anyway
That is bullshit, at least here in Spain people work their asses off
The problem is not lazyness, but incompetent administration and corruption, seriously our politicians are shit, either useless, or useless and thieves
speak for yourself
Those who do it just basically sleep for a while in the afternoon at home
I haven't heard of a single place where people do siesta at work in Spain
The Chinese do that though
>I never understood the siesta
To make you understand *why* does siesta exist, we have to go to Agricultural Spain
We can say siesta is a (mostly) southern thing and was indeed more common in agricultural Andalusia than the rest of Spain
You see, Andalusia's heat was and still is dangerous if not deadly + farmers schedules were elongated to the extreme by the landowners and they used almost their entire workforce to work on arid land during the day and part of the night
They almost had no night rest because they started their shifts early in the morning (usually way before dawn) and finished after sundown
As the shifts were long and they barely had rest they used their free time (usually from 11 AM to 15 or 16 PM) to sleep and recharge, a.k.a: siesta
Though, that free time was used because if they worked from 11 to 16, the heat and the *Terral* (extreme mass of hot air that comes from Africa) would probably kill almost all land workers
And that's how the half of Spain managed to survive extreme temperatures and abusive work enviroments and schedules by sleeping while the rest of the countries just didn't understand we didn't wanted to become part of the KFC menu
That you for coming to *Siesta 101*
Now, to your questions:
>How do you do it
Nowadays, it depends on your schedule
If you work during the day you don't do it but if your schedule starts at late-afternoon or night time you certainly gonna need sum good ass siesta
>Do you stop working and take a nap
I mean, if you want to get fired on the spot, yeah lol
>Where do you sleep if you're not at home
>Does everyone sleep or do you take turns
This two depend on the job
If you work as a doctor you may have a room to rest or sleep, to stop you from having sleep deprivation problems during your shifts
In that same case, it also works  by taking turns
Most jobs,though, don't have any of them
You have to wait until you go home and then take a nap
They know nothing about Switzerland aside from some cozy statistic one of their NRA members spilled out
Americans and Swiss are very different in terms of their day to day culture
Right wing (mostly white) Americans are super concerned with interacting/living in the same city/neighborhood as minorities and their feeling of power that guns give them keeps them at bay
without guns, they'd be forced to really try to mingle with their neighbors and get along without the forceful coexistence maintained by whites having guns and minorities fearing said whites
After all, guns were used to exert power over slaves and to pressure the government to not get involved in Southern communities (e.g. extra policing) where armed KKK-like people live
I live in one of the most expensive cities in the country, I have a nice normal job and I save at least 50%, after taxes, of my income
I have an apartment (100sqm, 3 bedrooms, balcony, garage, swimming pool
in a nice and young neighborhood) and most of my mortgage is already paid
I'm thinking in buying a house outside the city because I'd like to have a private garden but I don't like the idea of being too far from services, work, family and friends
I'm not sure what to do but I'm saving all the money I can and due to covid I don't expend too much
Before having a daughter I did one or two big trips a year and 5-10 small trips inside Spain or Europe
She goes to a public school and if she wants to, she'll go to a public university
We have public health insurance so mostly everything is already covered, I've paid for a couple of vaccines that weren't covered
I've seen average salary is 27k€/year before taxes so I guess I'm lucky middle class
I have friends earning more and less than that money but our lifestyles are pretty similar, mostly if changes the neighborhood, the car
I have some money invested in bitcoins just for fun, maybe in 20 years I'll have a retirement plan or I'll have nothing, I wouldn't lose much
I invested some money in the past but today you have to invest with high risk to get something and I have another plans in mind
In Spain middle class is almost gone
The thing is, with a small salary you can still live as the cost of living is not as  prohibitive as in the US
Is both
If there is no middle class is because the country is poor
You are either low class (not really poor, as people can pay their homes, water, electricity, phone bills, but they can barelly save money for luxuries like vacations in foreign countries and that kind of stuff) or rich
Yes, I sometimes mayor remember a word in Catalan or English but not in Spanish
I speak catalan at home and with friends/family, I barely use Spanish in my real life, but I watch tv and movies in spanish, I also read books and internet always in Spanish/English
So it's kind of weird but I believe I know more words in Spanish than in Catalan, I forget words in both languages sometimes but mostly I forget Catalan words
I believe this is because of the words used in normal conversations, that are usually very common, in comparison to words used in books/internet
Sure, call it a "senior moment".
All the time
In my case is more like the first thought comes in English and I have to force it in Spanish
This changes if I'm in Spain for a while but sometimes when I just arrive I mix both languages (Spanglish)
&#x200B;
In a few days my brain set Spanish as primary language haha and the issue fades away
Norwegian
I don't know since I can't notice the difference, I mean, when I see a nordic person speaking I don't know if he's speaking swedish, finnish, danish, norwegian or icelandic
I'd totally love it :)
Interesting idea, worth a try
well, first we better ask around to see who's available :)
"La 1" (namely: the one / the first one) is the first one in the list and it is a public government-owned channel (part of the major collection of government-owned channels "RTVE" = spanish radio television)
In regards of popularity, according to statista, "Telecinco" (literally "telefive") is the most popular one , having attained a 14
5% audience share during the last year
This channel is mostly known for its celebrity / gossip tv shows
Also this channel is owned by Mediaset, a larger tv broadcasting italian company
TIL Mediaset is italian
I remember watching RTL in Spain back when we had the old antennas
Oh I didn't know that
Guess they didn't think very hard when they named the one in spain then ROFL
Do you remember when Tele5 started showing seminaked ladies in every show (las mamachicho y tal)
That's right after Italy (Berlusconi's Mediaset) got involved
IKR !!!! I learned that pretty recently too
Happy cake day !!!!!!
Thanks
Amazing how fast a year goes by
Thanks
I honestly hadn't even noticed lol
Because of how imperatives are constructed, many of our most usual verbs have them sound awful, so people end up changing them for a more natural sounding construction
Problem is, if you use the imperative according to grammatical rules you automatically sound  snobby and pretentious, but if you don't, it sounds vulgar and lazy
So for several important verbs, there are only wrong options
English: teaching my 5yo to read is a nightmare
So many exceptions and nothing is spelled the way it looks
English spelling is a cluster fuck
Spanish: I dislike not having a word for toes
I don't know why it bothers me so much, but after 15 years, saying "feet fingers" still sounds dumb to me
Nowadays most people use the infinitive form instead of the imperative, you can even see it in working emails
I agree with the comment above but for me using the infinitive, especially written, looks extremely uneducated
Funny thing, Google keyboard tends to automatically change the correct imperative form and use the infinitive instead
Bloody annoying
It's a bit of a mix
For instance the reflexive plural imperative of Ir (to go) should be 'idos', but that sounds awful
So a very common alternative is 'iros', which preserves the root of the infinitive
That has actually been accepted by the Spanish Academy of Language
But then lots of people will just say 'irse', which is basically just infinitive (+reflexive) but conveys the imperative function somehow
Now that I've written this out, it sounds much more complicated than I anticipated
Sorry, I guess
Iberian Union back intensifies
And as a Portuguese said already in this thread, it wouldn't last long, the same history as some centuries ago
\- Portugal: they would try to break apart
\- France: we would try to break apart
\- Andorra: nah
\- Morroco: Balkans 2
0 Gibratarian Boogaloo
\- Great Britain: we'd have to ask Scots how well they're doing with England
I foresee something like the human centipede but with countries
I agree to get married, but only if we are ruled by Portugal and not the opposite, our politics and our territorial organization are a mad house
&#x200B;
JajajjajajajjjaJj
We'll take town by town like with Olivenza
Then, after 200 years you realize Portugal is only Lisbon and Cascais
ha ha ha (evil laughter)
Well, Olivenza would be easily solved
It doesn’t belong to Portugal, it doesn’t belong to Spain, it belongs to the union :)
What would be bad about merging with Spain
OP did not say invasion, said merge, but whatever, you can keep your prejudices
We basically copied most of how the administration works from you, so it is not that different
That's the premise of the EU, isn't it
Really, if you annexed NK USSR-style, nothing would change
If anything, puppet government would no longer have access to nukes, so win-win
Though it would be sad to see Korean disappear from half of the Korean Peninsula
A Franco-luso-hispano-british union
WORLD DOMINATION BABY
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I don’t know why you’d be nervous
People would throw *fireworks* everyday in celebration
Now doesn’t that sound lovely
_Cries in Catalan (Mallorca dialect) for having to learn German now_
Well at least I will have free university although no more Google Street view
Nah
We treat all of our communities well, and have never ignored any of them
Right \*reads hand\*, uh santundar and ah, extremoduro, and that place that’s called like a wine
Well, we don't want anyone that deep fry pizza either
:-)
Do you have your own Police
Do you manage your budgets in security, environment, education, culture and health on your own
Is your language co-official with English
Do you have your own taxing
That's how our Communities work
I guess we would be in the middle xD
I mean, even without annexation, it’s still a good idea to learn german in ~~Spain~~ Mallorca
We don’t have any common borders, but can we join too
I left it out on purpose
You don't seem to understand the concept of merge
You should leave the EU, because Germany's interest prevails, as it has more votes
Actually, true, in all seriousness
We tried doing that with the French, did not work out too well
Don’t recommend allowing another country’s army to march through yours either “accidentally” nor accidentally
Wrong
In Spain, more or less one third of the laws come from the EU, one third come from the country and one third come from the regions
My opinion is that you have some prejudice against Spain or the Spanish people, maybe I don't have enough information to state that, but that's my impression
No tengo ni idea
I don't do that, so I don't know
You just said "I don't know".
The word for Flemish in Spanish is 'flamenco' (like the music genre)
So you could imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered that Flanders it wasn't what I thought it was
I guess the melanin skipped a generation here or i'm adopted, as a blond green eyed person
Our days are longer and social life doesn't end when the day's over
I kind of understand that, when you see it from outside it feels like we are lazy and don't work hard enough I suppose
We just have more free time
I mean, to be honest I've worked abroad and we do have this attitude of not working too hard because "they'll pay us the same anyways" (which I think is a pretty fair way of thinking, specially considering out shitty salaries, and I proudly do it myself)
If we can put less effort without consequences we do
The problem is many places ignore worker's rights, and things like unpaid extra hours still being a thing nowadays, specially if you're young and no one else is willing to hire you
We are laid back but at the same time some business treat us like slaves
well
some things seen from today's perspective can be considered pure evil, let's not erase that
But it is true that there is a lot of "Black Legend", mostly spread by countries like The Netherlands and Britain I think
Yeah that also baffled me for a bit
I even wondered what the language was like (it was either like the flamingo sound or like flamenco music as in it's spanish but like a son g and hard to understand)
Did you ever try it out to see if it worked
Yeah, i thought everyone in the US learnt Spanish bc we learn English, and some of them do but not at a good level, and even then don't know where Spanish speaking countries are
I also thought that the reason germans learn spanish in school was because in Spain you can learn german in school
I really thought learning languages was an exchange, too bad it's not :(
Maybe the sound but the vocabulary is really similar, I can read Italian without going to an Italian class ever but I can say the same about French and Portuguese
I would say  French is more similar to catalan than Italian
Edit:if you wonder how we could sound Italian while speaking Spanish just listen to any Argentinian
Yeah, it was definitely Britain
I figured lol, just like the whole irish=redhead
True that's also a good point
I didn't notice you didn't said lazy
It's kind of the biggest stereotype so I instinctively went for it
Sorry
It was John, I hate that guy
Geographically it's closer to catalan and I speak Spanish, Catalan and had French at school
But don't believe me, it's in the same language branch too
Yeah, and I don't agree
Italian and Spanish are way closer in structure, pronunciation and spelling to each other than to French
That's why Spanish and Italian are mutually comprehensible languages while French and Italian/Spanish aren't. You can look it up
Not in my house
But my aunt used to set up one in her house for Christmas Eve dinner
If there were enough kids (3 or more) then yes, to let the kids have fun with each other and adults have some relative freedom
Not really
In my family kids were seated to a side with the smallest being beside their parents
Totally
Even when there are enough empty seats
It's a neat way parents have to be able to have dinner without being bothered by a kid each 2 minutes
We don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but yes during our family meetings we usually had naturally a kids table, because the adults always talked about boring stuff and we wanted to be able to get up and run around if we wanted to
We are about 15 cousins and the adults alone already filled a table, so it was the best solution for everybody involved
Now nobody cares, we are all grown up, many don't come to such family meetings anymore
Kids table only still exists, cause the "adults" still talk about boring stuff
Not in my family and never have met onyone that do it
Wouldn't surprise me if they do it in big gatherings
You know each day I'm more sure that we are all the same lmao
I never had one in my house, and when I went to someones house I hated it
Yeah, but now that I'm older I understand
I know in France is not usual, but 46C is not the end of times
Meh
I’m not competing
Just drink lots of water even if you don’t feel thirsty, avoid sun from 12 noon to 4 afternoon and you should be fine
Plan for an A/C machine next year
Climate change is here to stay
Believe me that in Spain houses are not inmune to this weather
There’s tricks to easy the heat wave as I told to the comment above
It’s quite useful to have an A/C machine
Worth it even for one week per year
Not rude but if you do that in my home town many people will think you have a sad life or something since you can't enjoy a "proper" meal
By other side if you do it in Madrid or Barcelona nobody will care
Yes
People will look weird at you
Spanish sit down to eat as long as it needs
Only exceptions are pastries and things like that
No, why should it be
Even in Madrid the first thing I would think is: poor guy/gal, he probably has to eat really fast to keep working
Yeah, usually it's more common in bigger cities or known touristic/university settings
Also, just so you know: "by other side" doesn't really work in English, you should use "on the other hand" or "on the other side".
I'm from Madrid
I once had to eat my lunch while going to the bus station so i didn't loose the bus
Felt like a looser and stupid AF
I've never seen someone eating something else than a sad snack while walking on the streets, maybe only tourists
Sitting on a bench or park yes, though, and i have done it, but not many times
Thanks ;-)
Then your schedule sucks hairy balls
Most workplaces leave ample time for lunch (some would say too much time)
Yeah, I also have heard mostly "on the other hand", but just as I was writing it I checked and apparently "on the other side" has also been used, albeit way more sparingly, in some official documents of organizations as important as UNESCO, so I thought I should add it
It's quite possiblethat Bismarck didn't really say this, but it's always been attributed to him:
«I am fairly convinced that Spain is the strongest country in the world
Century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success».
Like I said
Quite probably misattributed, but it kinda holds some truth
«[Las dos Españas] is a pretty well stablished concept within our identity
"I would sooner be a foreigner in Spain than in most countries
How easy it is to make friends in Spain
" - George Orwell
How many justices are there in your countries' Supreme Courts
In Spain, the Supreme Court is composed of some 100 justices (called magistrates), divided into several specialised halls of justice:
- First Hall, or Civil Hall
- Second Hall, or Criminal Hall
- Third Hall, or Administrative Hall
- Fourth Hall, or Social Hall
- Fifth Hall, or Military Hall
And then there are some special halls:
- Hall of Article 61 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary Power
- Hall of Jurisdictional Conflicts
- Hall of Conflicts of Authority
The members of the Constitutional Court are judges or can they be professors of different aspects of the Law
I think the Conseil Constitutionnel would be equivalent to Spain's Constitutional Court, which is actually a council and not a court
Leaving the Conseil Constitutionnel aside, what would be the court that is highest up the judiciary foodchain in France
Cour de Cassation
It seems that your highest courts are more than adequately staffed
> If ya mean the highest court to try someone in a criminal, civil, familiar and so on then it's the " Supreme court of cassation"
That one was actually my question, the apex of the judiciary foodchain
So, more or less like Spain
In Spain, the mandatory retirement age for judges/justices/magistrates is 72
Interesting
In Spain, the judiciary chain would be:
\- First instance and instruction tribunals
\- If you appeal, it goes to the Provincial Court
\- The next appeal would be towards the Regional Superior Court
\- And lastly, the Supreme Court
The Supreme Court, of course, has exclusive jurisdiction for cassation appeals, meaning that you appeal alleging that the Law has been incorrectly applied and you want the Supreme Court to set juridical doctrine on the correct application of the Law
For some reason I thought that would have been Jena or Heidelberg
In Spanish it's very, very easy
Numbers 0-15, all multiples of 10 up to 100, and 500 are unique words (some of them share a common structure but it's easier to just learn them by heart)
Everything else is a composition of numbers in decreasing value
Example 1:
6 = seis
10 = diez
16 = dieciseis (diez + seis)
Example 2:
7 = siete
20 = veinte
100 = cien
127 = ciento veintisiete (cien + veinte + siete)
Example 3:
8 = ocho
40 = cuarenta
300 = trescientos (tres x cien)
1000 = mil
1348 = mil trescientos cuarenta y ocho
Edit: As I've been pointed out I had forgotten about 500, which uses the same prefix as 15
Unsurprisingly, Afrikaans is identical except for the spelling
In galician we have both quiñentos and cincocentos
I did forget 500 (fixed now) but I said numbers 0-15 right at the beginning
And I did not think OP wanted to know about ordinals but they're even easier
Veinte y siete - > Veintisiete, because 'ei' becomes just i
It's latin all the way down
We certainly had foreign troops (Americans) in several bases, (Torrejón, Zaragoza, Morón de la Frontera) and there is still US Navy presence in the naval base of Rota
The other bases are still in use by our army
Another year in which for XYZ reason, I haven’t been on reddit for enough time to entirely miss the survey
Oh well
Count another gay man o’er here
I like this one
Good summary
LA ROSALÍA.
She's starting, the time will tell
Las kétchup- asereje
Los del rio- la macarena
Julio iglesias- julio iglesias idk any song
La pantoja- marinero de luces
Marta sanchez- soy yo
Monica naranjo- sobrevivire
Rocio jurado- como una ola
Ruth lorenzo- singing in the rain
Pastora soler- quédate conmigo
Btw she is fucking amazing
They were and are very famous in Spain and some Latin American countries
I think ruth lorenzo and pastor soler deserve a lot more fame chenoa and rosa too, they both have a lot of talent
La Rosalía!!!!
Héroes del Silencio :) and Enrique Iglesias :/
La Rosalía is a recent one
Alejandro Sanz ...idk if he’s still relevant though
Also Nek and Pino d'Angiò
What about Mahmut Orhan
You missed The Corrs
Omg i forgot her, rosalia too thx
Oh, sorry, true
my mistake
We use the phrase 'que tal' as greeting
It means how are you but we just use it as a greeting for some reason
I mean, Klaus is pretty good
You might know it
I really liked Buñuel and the Labyrinth of the Turtles too, which came out a few years ago
Calico electrónico was hilarious
"Coger" just means to grab in Spain, but it means to fuck in much of Hispanic America
I have one of these
In Colombia, the word "marica" means something like lad in the UK or dude in the US
Meanwhile, in Spain, the exact same word is a derogatory term used to mock gay people
"Concha" means "shell" in Spain but "pussy" in much of Latin America
It can get specially funny because in Spain the affectionate nickname of Concepción, a common female name, is "Concha".
"Coger" in Spain means "to pick up" (something), but in latin America it means "to fuck". So if you say, "voy a coger al perro y luego vuelvo a casa" in Spain would mean "I'm going to pick the dog up and then I'll come back home" but in latin America would mean "I'm going to fuck the dog an then I'll come back home". So
You can imagine the problem xD
The same things goes for "agarrar"
In Spanish "excitado" also means turned on (sexually)
We just say we're "emocionado" (thrilled in a good way)
Your link didn't link properly :(
"Joder" as in "fuck" is archaic in Spain
It's something you'd expect to hear in a historical movie
Most people use it in the non-sexual way
Pretty popular, most of men don't shave it and have beard (taking care of it, I mean, not an irregular beard)
Unfortunately there are many who don't take care of it (or do but just don't have anything worth taking care of)
Probably bad lol
The last games weren't the best, Germany is doing even worse so that one doesn't really count
I wouldn't be surprised if we go home on the first round of the knockout stage
Edit: I just looked the groups up
That F group can't be real
Maybe with the covid football is less annoying, but I usually hope it loses ASAP, so people start behaving normally (their obsession for football is very annoying and I just want to continue living normally)
Russian and Italian are the best sounding imo
But if it's written, then I find Gaelic oddly exotic
I love Italian
It has a nice musicality around it and it is so expressive
My favorite is English, easy enough to learn and useful
The one I like to hear the most is probably Italian, sounds super cool
Italian and Japanese
For some reason, I really like spoken Greek, how which I don't understand anything
Que te jodan, hijo de puta
Happy cake day
Que te joda un pez espada, hijo de la grandísima puta
Voy a coger una escalera para subirme a los cuernos de tu padre a cargarme en tus putos muertos
king philip the second
great king in spain
hated in portugal maybe
[**Francis Drake**] He was a literal pirate, i think he's praised in the UK
Also he was the leader of the [british counter-armada] wich many people dont know about
Hernán Cortes
Pictured as a genious, brave, and astute conquistador over here
Not so loved in latin america
like the duke of Alba
oh come on
that poor guy
he was like a milenial in his time, he just wanted to chiil and hunt
hate the actual gobvernant, the duke of Lerma hahaha
Piet Who
yeah, pretty brutal guy
one doesn't earn a repitation as a general by being peacefull haha
Wouldn't that be the Count-Duke of Olivares, though
He was the guy who ran the show and tried to implement the Union of Arms
Hm for obvious reasons
Spanish is the second language by number of native speakers and the third most spoken language in the world
It's also the second or third most written language in the world
If that's the path we'll be among the last to die
My language is a minoritarian one, but it's not like we're all going to start speaking English out of the blue, specially since the level of English here is very low
Spanish is a much greater threat to the Valencian language than English
Nope, although American Spanglish could have some slim chances of being a threat if it becomes a too mixed, too big and too influential pidgin language
nope not at all
having a language that is the 2º in native speakers in all its dialects i honestly dont feel that like a treath
Hmm
I think im the only one who  isnt concerned only because I think a global language is the way to go
Sure, not in my lifetime, but I hope everyone in the world speaks the same language long-term
I'm not worried in the slightest for Spanish
It's the second largest by native speakers, and the third overall
It's true that English is influencing our grammar and the way we speak Spanish more and more, but it's far from disappearing
Galician however
I do fear that unless we do something about it, it's doomed
And not because of English, but Spanish
People (including myself
I was raised speaking Spanish) use it less and less
We are seeing some neofalantes (new speakers: people raised in Spanish deciding to use Galician) among the late millenials / early gen z, but it'll take more than that
The population is getting old, a lot of Galicians emigrate (thus they no longer have the need to use their language in any situation), and yeah, it's declining in use
Language is such an important aspect of our cultural identity, it really is sad seeing some of them go extinct
Hopefully neofalantes can turn the tables, we'll see
Spanish is another language spoken round the globe, so no, i am not worried
Agree
A lot of people learn French as their third language (after English), and it's still very important internationally, being the diplomatic language of choice
Not for anything most passports are written in three languages: the native of the country, English and French
And as a Galician I honestly cannot help myself but admire how most people in Quebec still prefer using French, their own language, before English
So yeah, French ain't disappearing anytime soon either
Conquistadores are iconic but they have kind of a bad press right now
The aragonese Almogavars, they were fighters from the aragonese crown, originally they were mostly shepherds/farmers from the aragonese and catalan pyrennees
They were not well equipped, instead they went with lightweight armor (helmet, some fur, sometimes a chain mail) and with light weapons (long knifes, short spears, curved swords
), they also didn't fight in a formation, but they kind of fight something closer to a current guerrilla fighting
They were poorly dressed and commonly with long beards/hair
Mostly fighting on foot
They cut supply lines, fought on the night, stroked by surprise
Against horses, they tended to attack the [hocks] or the guts, to make the rider fall and then get on top of him and kill him with the knives
They liked to fight in harsh conditions, with trees, stones, etc, that they could use in their advance and also preferred to fight in a open way, but if they were in a disadvantage they could use a formation for defending purposes
They were commonly mercenaries, and went to enemy territory, sack it and take loot, create chaos and go out before the enemy strikes back
As they looked for loots, their incursions could be of a few days long until they get a good one, that was a reason of the needing of a lightweight equipment, so they could move fast for days, loot, destroy, ravage and go out
An interesting thing was the psicological warfare, they had a flint stone with them, they used to crash it against their sword before battle, throwing big sparks while they screamed ("Awake iron
", "Aragon, Aragon
", "Saint George
", ...) to frighten the enemy
However, the most famous story about them is when the biggest almogavar company went outside
As time went, the aragonese crown frontier against an islamic enemy, which was their way of living, was getting smaller, so the crown of Aragon sent them to fight in Sicily/Naples, but after peace was sign, the almogavars had no job, and you can't have that kind of troops in your territory without nothing to do, so Aragon signed a treaty with the byzantine empire and  around 4000 to 10000 almogavars went to fight the turks
Long story short, after a lot of fighting and a lot of killed turks, the almogavars demanded payment, byzantine emperor denies it, almogavar leader gets killed by him, and in revenge, they started a campaign of looting, ravage and extermination of byzantine civilians, during it they also defeated a big byzantine army in the process and killed the alans mercenaries that helped the byzantines (around 9000)
They keep in their revenge thing until they move to Athens they took Athens and then Neopatras and ended giving that territory to the Crown of Aragon
Los tercios
They were a military unit, feared all through Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries
Increadibly flexible and experienced in battle
They dominated european Battlefield for 120 years and were behind many famous victories like the Battle of San Quintin where they annihilated the french army
Bandoleros in southern Spain definitely
They were brigands that roamed around Sierra Morena during the 19th century
The most iconic one was José María Hinojosa Cobacho, known as El Tempranillo (The Early Bird)
He was born into a poor family suffering from the privations of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain at the beginning of the 19th century
He is widely believed to have killed his first man at the age of just thirteen, either as the result of an attack on his family or an insult aimed at his mother
Evading capture, he joined a group of bandoleros who were based in a cave near the Despeñaperros pass on the main northern route into Andalucía. They were essentially highwaymen, collecting a sort of ‘toll’ from rich travellers to ensure their safe passage through the region
El Tempranillo was somewhat of a charmer, and his fame soon spread
He was also likened, as others before him, to Robin Hood, as he redistributed his ill-gotten gains to the poor
He became a cult figure, not only in Andalucía but also farther afield
Some European tourists to the area even went so far as to pay to have themselves ‘held up’.
I won't lie, if I ever meet someone named Lil' Flute I expect him to rap while playing the flute
If we're talking about **cool** Spanish groups we could mention bandoleros, not conquistadores
Do you mean the likes of Serrallonga and Rocaguinarda
No more than vikings
Drakkars and Galleons
Both serve to attack other peoples' land unprovoked and steal their riches
Now, no contest
I'd even choose being born today, so technically living 25 years into the future
Wouldn't want to go too much into the future, though, just in case
Would have been good to have been born in the 70s. The great recession hit when I was meant to join the labour market
I would have been better positioned to weather it
If I had to pick a historical period, I'd go for 18th century's New Granada
King Charles III funded a number of [scientific expeditions] being part of which would have been fascinating
I would've loved to live my youth in the 80s and 90s, when the economy was booming, we just got out of a dictatorship and the future looked bright
But then again, I would've been part of creating the problems that the current youth faces
Besides all that, I'm a gay man, so I don't think it would be nice to live in a time when my basic civil rights were still put up to question
I would've been forced to either a youth in the closet or a much more rampant homophobia than I've experienced in my life as it is
Taking only that into account, I guess I'm living in the best time period I could ever imagine lol
Today
None, seriously
It's been complicated
So basically right now would probably be the best
At least we have internet
I would prefer to don't go much in time, so maybe 1992 for Barcelona 92 and The Expo that happened in Spain that year too, maybe another travel to 1999, and that's about it
The 1860s-1890s i d love to see the new ideas in Spain flowing in and the industrialization
If I could retain all of my memories then probably the 20s and 30s. I could warn people about certain things if they'd believe me
If I'm born without memories then the 70s would be a good time
> Yes, there were things going on then that are now considered distasteful
That's a very mild way of speaking about the horrific conditions of the working class, the vast majority of the population, and the whole package of colonialism
You Brits can be proud about many things, but if you decide to be proud of an idealised vision of the Empire it's pretty understandable that people consider it politically incorrent
I agree that victorian age might have been an exciting time if you were a male bourgeois with all those technological progresses, tho
Nobody is going to criticise you for feeling proud about Parliamentarism, ending slave trade, your literature, your popular music, your many scientific discoveries and even the industrial revolution
As long as, you know, acknowledge that it did cause a lot of suffering to the working class
It gives a really bad impression that you dismiss that as "things that are now considered distateful", almost to the point of seeming like a parody
Here's the thing: history for a long time has been romanticised by nationalisms everywhere, not only in Britain
And now people look at it through a different lens and they see that it wasn't all glorious warfare against the enemy^(TM), court politics and exquisite art
People are now looking at other aspects of history and it turns out that things were pretty bad for a vast majority of people until very recently
And many people are going to identify with that majority of people
The views about the past have changed and I don't see how that's a bad thing
I think not having that idealisation actually makes us see the good parts in a better way and not dismiss the bad parts so that we try not to repeat them because history isn't a line of uninterrrupted infinite progress
Maybe it's more pessimistic, but I think it's better than a romanticised bliss of ignorance
In Spain dubbing directors usually take a lot of libertys if tgat makes a better product, for example in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when Rocket is mocking taserface he calls him "cara anchoa" (anchovy face)
This comes from a youtuber who a month prior was slapped for calling a man the vwry same thing
EDIT: (apparently this comes from the original version) Another example would be in the Avengers movies, during caps planning of tge battle of New York, Iron Man calls Hawkeye "Legolas"
A last one, in the Netflix show Superdrags, tge three protagonists say "Hadta luego Maricarmen" (Goodbye Mari Carmen)
Another joke that was told because here tgere is a gay tv host that once said that complaining or something and then became a Meme
The Fresh Prince's American-centric jokes were changed by Spanish ones, as I doubt Pippi Långstrump was ever released in the US, for example
In the original american dub for TF2, spy has a french accent, but in the french dub, he has a british accent
I also heard that the heavy sounds really smart and intellectual in the russian dub instead of just a dummy like in the english dub
Regarding Spanish i can't think of anything
Fresh Prince's dub was 100% made up in Spanish and it was brilliant
To a lesser extent, Simpsons and Futurama were made up or at least heavily adapted too
Oh, then i was mistaken (i would swear that scene had joke in there)
But i have another example from Avengers that doesnt go on the joke side
The scene where the SHIELD agent is playing Galaga, or another retro game, Stark says "that man is playing the martians" martians (marcianitos) is the name given to Space Invaders
It was done because Galaga either wasnt very popular in Spain or straight up didnt arrived, but space invaders was not only popular (in the 80s) but it also became some kind of standarized name, like when adults call all the consoles Nintendo
I'll try :P

Ouch, one of the lowest scores on the whole thread
Could you send me the list on DMs
I don't know the exact number, but in my island, which is very small, there is [one] So i assume there are many throughout the country
> My Dad does this
He claims he gets confused with "what word is appropriate to use" but I've explained it at least five times so at this point, I just say something like "How do you know that someone is old
They don't know they shouldn't use the N-word
" My Dad always likes to pretend that he isn't that old so I know I can get him with this
I feel kinda bad about it but NOT using the n word also isn't hard, especially after it's been explained to you why you shouldn't.
Does your family speak in english or what
Ah so it's another word that has been assimilated to the english one
South Europe
And those who live in the coast of the the Mediterranean sea (as myself) would say, also, that they are  Mediterranean
We are part of the Iberian peninsula
At least we can agree on that one :P
FWIWI I've never doubt it
Good one
I've always thought Austria IS the most central european country in Europe
I am not sure if there’s such a majority feeling that way
In the north I feel most people would say we are Western Europe
I think there's a greater consensus of us being Iberian
The only thing that my grandmothers agree on (one is from Valencia and the other one is from Barcelona) is that they are Mediterranean
Southern Europe IS a bit of a hotchpotch
Greece and Spain have very little in common apart from the weather
Culturally we're Closer to France
You are not Mediterranean, not because you're not by the Mediterranean sea, but because you are not shouting and yelling all the time
It's a privilege to share that with you, neighbors
Yeah, I'd say we're Western Europe
I'd say Western europe
Tell that to the Canarios
Indeed
To me, the whole Southern Europe concept is too vague
I feel like it’s only agreed by people either from the most stereotypical, Mediterranean areas that could correspond to the mental image of this concept (Mediterranean people feeling like they are Mediterranean Europe, which can be valid for regions of these countries but doesn’t apply to the whole of them) or by tourists that go to these areas and think that they define the whole countries
The majority of Spain is closer culturally to France than to Greece, and the majority of Greece is closer culturally to Serbia than to Spain, with due respect for all of these countries, which shows how Southern Europe is too, too tenuous of a cultural idea
Also, OP probably shouldn’t gatekeep western Europe
But they are not even in Europe, geographically haha
Mmm no, take a look at a map, the UK is way east of Spain, Ireland is at the north
I think the reason it's been established IS that there IS a cultural tie in the mediterranean, Portugal, Spain, Italy, even southern France and Malta are very much alike
The problem comes when you get to the balkans
They have a different history, slavic and turkic influences, the greeks, orthodox christianity, It just feels quite different
I live by the border and even the next town (which I can almost see from my window) is a world apart
Yeah, It has less extreme weather than the Atlantic, in general, fewer and smaller waves and weaker tides
And it's definetely warmer
That said there are very dangerous chokepoints like the straight of Gibraltar
There ARE tides, and there can be storms and big waves
I understand that, but I feel like that cultural tie is clear in the Mediterranean areas but starts disappearing when heading inland
Some of these countries are culturally more heterogeneous than the UK, Netherlands, Baltics
and grouping the whole of them together under a supposed ‘Mediterranean’ culture is just too much
By that rule of thumb we’d be considering Mediterranean, for example, some of the regions with a larger Celtic cultural background such as Galicia and Bretagne, Germanic parts of southern Tirol
it just feels vague
Yeah, but i'd say even a galician has strong cultural ties with a sicilian, (i would say more than with a dutch)
However there are very near to being an exception
Of course in any closed set there are fringes, don't Matter what you do
>more heterogeneous than the UK, Netherlands, Baltics
I think we often underestimate the enormous differences that small island has
That being said, Italy and Spain are among the most multicultural countries in Europe
I would say western european has roughly two subsets: northwestern european and southwestern european
And as with all cultural changes it's mostly a continuous change
Those are very good points, I generally agree with those
About the UK, having lived there I stand for my point
For the amount of population living there, the differences in gastronomy, folk
are way smaller than what you’s expect, and the massive relative weight of England’s population has meant that the differentiating feats that you may expect to find in Cornwall, Wales, Scotland
have deteriorated quite a bit
The Sicily bit is also subjectively debatable
As a Leonese, I have felt much more alien in Sicily an in Den Haag, for example
This is very subjective though, the average experience may be otherwise
Your points are very good though, and I think your last paragraph is spot on
>About the UK, having lived there I stand for my point
For the amount of population living there, the differences in gastronomy, folk
are way smaller than what you’s expect, and the massive relative weight of England’s population has meant that the differentiating feats that you may expect to find in Cornwall, Wales, Scotland
have deteriorated quite a bit
it's true that for their population the differences are pretty small
I'm also not an expert on the UK, i've been only 3 times and for a very short amount of time
Therefore, I take your Word
>The Sicily bit is also subjectively debatable
As a Leonese, I have felt much more alien in Sicily an in Den Haag, for example
I didn't expect that
Truth be told i haven't been in Sicily so i might have underestimated their alien
ness
i felt very much at home when in Italy, though i've only been to Veneto, Milan, Tuscany and Rome
As for the netherlands it's just so gloomy, wet, flat, buttery, serious, cold
even their cheese tastes different, nah i did feel It was different
In comparison going through Southern France feels weirdly familiar
And the balkans  i think that's the weirdest you can get in Europe, maybe thrace IS the most alien region, but the strangest i've been IS Albania
Unless you consider the caucasus, then they win by a lot
You are right about the differences in the UK being underestimated, though
We think about the UK being culturally almost monolithic and it’s not
However, these differences are more subtle than in other countries
Sicily, and generally most areas south of Rome, are a different animal
The difference with northern Italy may be even larger than the equivalent in Spain, for example
>The difference with northern Italy may be even larger than the equivalent in Spain, for example
I suppose, i've Heard calabrian
i thought It was romanian
It is not the norm in Spain
It would be rude to ask guests to do it
No, I don't thake them off but I'm still a civilised person
You don't really take off your shoes at the door here
When you get to your own home you usually do and wear slippers, but guests are not supposed to take off their shoes, unless they want to for any reason, or if for instance it's raining and their shoes are dirty
When I found out it was a thing people would do in the vast majority of other countried did it I was really weirded out
Yep
Only when there is a considerable degree of trust and yet it's usually the guests who politely ask to take of their shoes
Slippers exist
I got used to it in Japan
And you gotta admit it's way more hygienic
....Yes
Even if there were no guests It's not like guests shoes are usually dirty anyways
No, you do it with slippers
Hey from this post it seems that it's a Mediterranean vs non-Mediterranean thing, you should be in our side
Slippers exists lol
There's a middle ground between street shoes and barefoot
I live in a really humid climate
but anyway, I think the doormat doesn't clean all the germs and stuff that you get walking outside
Because you actually leave footprints if you're barefoot, even with socks
Some people do only wear socks, speacially if they have wooden floors
But here wooden floors are only common in apartments so if you live in a house, the floors will be ceramic tiles, which can get cold unless you have radiating floor
Most people don't usually have mud and if their shoes are dirty enough with mud that they can't clean them in the doormat, they'll be asked or will ask themselves to take them off
Tortilla de patata It's a dish of the poor but it's extremely popular with everyone
I'll say the [Starbucks] in the Royal Theater of Madrid
It used to be a Costa until not too long ago
The McDonald's in Gran Vía (Madrid) is quite fancy looking
Vienna has the prettiest buildings in europe
[saved you a google]
I live in Spain, currently living in the most infected city (3000+ and counting) and increasingly anxious about the situation
I have participated, this makes me feel less alone
Thanks
[Paquito el Chocolatero] probably
It's the most played song
Soy una taza, una tetera, una cuchara y un cucharon
Un plato hondo, un plato llano
A classic song in wedding partys haha
Yes
In fact, the Roman name for the Iberian peninsula, Hispania, literally means "Land of rabbits".
Not something you see often but it's easy to find it so I guess there's some demand, at least
I don't really pay that much attention to it but I'm pretty sure I see it often in the supermarket where I usually buy groceries
Fun fact: Traditional Valencian Paella has rabbit and chicken
It's not something prohibited, but not many people do it, even sparingly
Rabbits are consider to be pets in many countries, but yes, very similar in Spain
I lived in Venezuela, the situation was getting worse and worse and because me and my family have double nationality thanks to my grandfather who is Spanish we moved to Spain
The Venezuela of today is completely different from the Venezuela  of my childhood which still wasn’t nowhere near as good as my parents childhood
Born in South Africa
Got offered a role in Bahrain so sold up and moved
Lived there 3 years and then got offered a job in the U.K. Lived there 17 years and then they voted to leave the EU
I want my children growing up in the EU (FoM is hugely important, IMO) so we sold up and moved to Spain
Andorra and Spain
Geographically or architecturally as well
Similar in what other senses
I've never been to any of them but I find the statement surprising
In Spanish a lot of them make sense, from what I'm seeing comparing to other languages:
H: hidrógeno
O: oxígeno
N: nitrógeno
C: carbono
Cu: cobre (not that far off)
W: can be wolframio or tungsteno, I think all chemists understand if you say either of them
However there are a lot that don't make sense also:
K: potasio
Na: sodio
Au: oro
Ag: plata
Hg: mercurio
Sb: antimonio
Sn: estaño
Pb: plomo (knowing it comes from plumbum it's quite understandable, tho)
S: azufre (but the compounds are more related to S usually, like HS is sulfuro de hidrógeno)
(I think that most of the ones I did not name here make sense, but I may be forgetting something)
Sciences were mostly taught in Galician and because that's the language I still think them I'm going to do that comparison
Most are the same (Fe - Ferro) or can be mostly deduced (Sc - Escandio) but there are some notable exceptions:
* K - Potasio and Kr - Cripton
The "k" doesn't exist in Galician
* Y - Itrio
The "y" doesn't exist in Galician
* W - Volframio
The "w" doesn't exist in Galician
* Au - Ouro
* Ag - Plata
This one is easy if you think of Argentina and the Silver River
* Ge - Xermanio or Sg - Seaborxio
"G" and "j" many times get changed to "x".
* S - Xofre
* P - Fósforo
* Sb - Antimonio and Sn - Estaño.
* Hg - Mercurio
* Pb - Chumbo
More or less yes and no some yes others no for example NA cobre
But for example W wolframio
in spanish, at least from spain, we say wolframio, so it has sense :)
&#x200B;
usually they have sense
It depends on the Region
I think Catalan is widely spoken in Catalonia by people of all ages, but I have no idea about other regions apart from Valencia
In Valencia most young people I know can speak Valencian, but as any other learnt language, not really as their native language
However, some of them speak in Valencian with their parents and are fully bilingual
Valencian is most commonly used in small towns but in bigger cities (I've lived in Alicante, Elx and València) the usual language is Spanish
Valencian is used in signs and such, and you can speak in Valencian with people, but I've always seen it as secondary
Most people I know that wanted to master Valencian had to attend an academy, they weren't fully bilingual
However, I don't live there anymore except for July and August so maybe things have changed
Yes
Valencian (catalán) is very commonly used
Normally people are raised with it and uses it with their families and friends
In official matters Spanish is more commonly used
It's perfectly normal to switch between Spanish and valencian between people, and if someone has some troubles with the regional language, it's customary that every member of the conversation automatically switches to Spanish
Asturian is not very widespread but recently I would say t there have been an increase in people learning it, and the regional television channel takes effort in spreading it
However, even thought it isn't used in it's totality, there is a lot of people, specially in rural areas, who speak Asturian, and mostly everyone speaks a minimun of it limited mostly to certain words, gramatical expressions and fonetics
I'm not Galician but no one has wrote a comment about them, so I'll do it
I was pretty surprised to learn how univucous (edit: ubiquitous) Galician is in the autonomy
Over 80% of the population speak it, which puts it ahead of all other regional languages in Spain
As for the rest
Basque is around 30-50% (depending on the province); Catalan is over 70% in Catalonia and slightly higher in the Balearic Islands; Valencian is around 60% in the comunitat (I think) and finally, Aranés is spoken by around a third of the valley of Aran
In general the regional languages in Spain are doing great, way better than the rule (in Europe) due partly to a decentralised attitude to the problem and great regional effort
However, there's exceptions like aragones and asturleones, which are still at risk of extinction
Btw: Aranés is a dialect of occitan (a language spoken in southern France)
The valley where it's spoken is actually in the northern side of the pyrinees
Yes, Catalan is taught at school and people use it in the street even if they don't speak catalan at home
It's a language very much alive with a very active culture with regional television, radio, theatre, literature and music in Catalan
In some specific areas of the Barcelona province you may find people who don't talk Catalan, immigrants or children of, but most people after some time living here end up speaking in Catalan to some extent
Still the same in Elx and Alicante, only older people/families speak Valencian on a daily basis
I took the Valencian test a few years ago and it was terrible, it is so different from the Valencian I have been speaking since I was a kid
And shows the French disregard in keeping regional languages
Compare French and Spanish sides of the Basque Country, or Aranés, an Occitan language that it is going to survive better in Spain than in France
It's a mistake, I must have been pretty tired because I wanted to say ubiquitous which means a completely different thing
Univocal (and not univucous) means that the interpretation is unique
I hadn't used the word ever in English and I translated it wrong
In Spanish it's unívoco and not univocoso, that's why you didn't find anything,
Institutions are a result of the will of the people too
They are not established out of thin air
When they decided in 1978 to make a constitution that respected the rights of minority languages we colectively decided on protecting them, regardless what the stupid morons of Vox or the PP would think
The attitudes and those political structures in those areas where they speak Catalan, Basque or Galician wouldn't allow for the imposition of Spanish the same way that French was imposed
Don Claudio Moyano, creator of the Moyano Law, making elementary education free and mandatory
[Canovas] brought political stability to Spain in the 19th century after almost an entire century of inner struggles, civil wars, coups and such
With hindsight we look down on his political two-party system and the political clientelism at the time as if that was an exclusively Spanish thing that only happened at that time, as if we completelly left behind those type of practices
But still, it brought peace to Spain for many decades, with all its faults and downsides

I live in Barcelona, Spain
The restaurant scene is pretty good, I only find the Asian restaurants a bit lacking, and I'm continuously looking for a great Indian place
I lived in London before and the South Asian food there is out of this world
Barcelona, however, does have some good Mexican Tex-Mex food, and lots of South American cuisines that I have not tried yet
In my own sloppy translation:
-From Don Quixote:
They bark, so we ride" (Ladran, luego cabalgamos)
Tough I think this is a quote from a Quixote movie
Well, just one and not that reliable
En un lugar de la Mancha, cuyo nombre no quiero recordar
Opening line to Don Quixote
I don't know, the witcher is pretty hot right now, maybe 'Hmmmm
Fuck' is more popular
"Lo bueno, si breve, dos veces bueno" of Baltasar Gracián.
>"What is good, if short, twice as good" (self explanatory)
"Poesía eres tú" de Becquer
Mainly for flirting tbh
>"Poetry is you" (used the weird order because in Spanish the order is also changed to a lyrical version not used normally)
"Vivo sin vivir en mí" de Maria Teresa de Jesús.
>"I live not within myself" (meaning not enjoying life/not having rest)
Darío, with a "D", just as "Don Quixote", so, close enough
I think our group is alright, however we can’t trust it because both Sweden and Poland have a good team that can mess up our chances
The group isn't bad but I would like to Spain to get whipped so hard they have to fire everyone in the Federation because of the shady things they do
On a side note, someone please explain to me how the English get blinded when they talk about football and always think they have the best chances to win
The official name in Spanish is the latin name, "et" which is the conjunction "and" in latin and also the origin of the ampersand symbol (& is just an e and a t mashed together)
But outside programming it's barelly used in Spanish, we use conjunction "y". Most people will use the English name
On the other hand, even though Spanish doesn't have a specific word for the **ampersand**, we do at least have one for the "**@**" symbol
_Por otra parte, aunque en español no tengamos una palabra concreta para el símbolo "**&**", al menos sí que tenemos una para la **arroba**._
>(similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)
We have it in Spanish keyboards for Spain (it's the second keyboard, on the "3" key on the number bar) and it's not a symbol we use
I thought for a second that you called carets esperluettes lol
We use all vowels except *i* but we use *y* (which technically we don't consider a vowel):
- *a* is a preposition, generally meaning "to".
- *e* and *y* means "and". *E* is only used when the following syllable is stressed and begins with an *i* sound
- *o* and *u* means "or". Same explanation than before for *u*.
Catalonian does use *i*, instead of *y*, meaning "and".
Yeah, it's normal, it's not really a common name
Most people, at least in Spain, will say something like "that thing that looks like an eight that means 'and'" before saying "et".
No se, la RAE no tiene dudas respecto al nombre del símbolo, ¿de dónde es esa cita
Alguna duda sí que tiene la RAE, teniendo en cuenta que ni en su [entrada para "et"] ni en la [entrada de "y^(2)"] a la que redirige menciona en ningún momento el símbolo "&". Por el contrario, en [su entrada para "arroba"] sí que reconoce su uso para el símbolo "@".
This right here
Depending on which keyboard I use (fun fact there are quite a few US English keyboards not only one) those keys will do one thing or the other
Personally I use US English International with Alt Gr, best one if you type in several different European languages
And for programming I use US English (the standard QWERT one)
Maybe I'm wrong but I think there are more Greek speakers than Catalan speakers
So it looks like a dick move towards the greeks
Yeah I think those are pretty common in most Slavic languages
Russian for instance, has the exact same ones
Funnily enough, ни too
La arroba se usa frecuentemente, & practicamente no la usa nadie a no ser que sea programador
¿Por que no se usa
Por que y no se puede acortar mas, es un unico caracter en ingles la conjuncion es "and" (3 caracteres) y la acortan a uno usando &

The king wanted a city without a cathedral so the church had no power
So he chose madrid because it was in the center of everything
To be more specific for anyone who wants to learn more:
Toledo seemed like the obvious choice because it was more or less in the centre and was alongside Seville the most important city of Castile
But it was also the seat of the archbishopric of Toledo, that happened to have the "primacy of the Spains", which meant that it was the highest ecclesiastical authority in all of the peninsula
Many high noble families had their lands and seat in Toledo and their surroundings
That includes powerful and old families like the Alvarez de Toledo (which might remind fellow Spaniards to a certain conservative politician)
As nanimo said, Phillip II didn't want competition over the control of the capital
Madrid was near Toledo, it was more centrical, it wasn't the seat of any bishop and there were no important noble families
It was known to the kings because the Cortes of Castile have met there a few times for those same reasons
Basically, Madrid was chosen because it was known to be an unimportant centrical town
It also had a castle or Alcazar, that was expanded to become the royal residence
It was located were the current Royal Palace stands, but it burnt out in a big fire in the 1700s.
I would guess sticking it up to the Papacy in the 1870s also played a role (gee how could you claim a state when your seat is our capital)
I like your Álvarez de Toledo reference and I didn't know abut it, thanks
Well i mean in new spain it was different
Much bigger territory, very sparcely populated
They did good taking advantage of already built infraestructure of the aztecs
But afaik during that time London remained the biggest and wealthiest city because of its port
Sí, Cayetana es de una de ls familias de más rancio abolengo de España. Comparable con los duques de Alba
Wasn't there any backlash when the Habsburgs decided to stay at Wien and handle all power from that city in the margins of the empire
Sabía que era rancia pero no el nivel al que se remonta la ranciedad de su familia
Me ha entrado curiosidad y lo estoy buscando ahora y parece que tienen su origen como alcaldes de Toledo en el siglo XII
La rama principal de hecho es la que fundó el ducado de Alba y el famoso Duque de Alba del siglo XVI era un Álvarez
La rama principal se extinguió cuando murió sin hijos la duquesa de Alba de los cuadros de Goya y heredó el sobrino, de la familia actual de los Fitz-James Stuart (de origen inglés)
Cayetana es la cabeza de una de las 17 ramas secundarias (wtf), que tienen distintos ducados, condados y marquesados
In spain we say "no me importa" for the simple "I don't care", however we also use "ni lo sé ni me importa" which means "I don't know nor care".
Using swear words we have many expressions:
"Me importa una mierda" or "Me importa un carajo" - "I don't give a shit/dick"
"Me importa tres cojones" - "I don't give 3 balls" (as in testicles)
"Me suda la polla" - "It sweats off my dick" or simply "me la suda" implying the dick part
There is also "Me la trae al pairo" and I just learned it's origin: "pairar" means setting a boat in a position balancing the water current and the wind so it just stands still, so it means that the hearing of whatever they told you doesn't alter you a bit, you don't care
Me la bufa, me la suda, me la trae al pairo, me la come, me la chupa, me la repanpinfla, me importa una mierda, me importa tres cojones, sudo de ello, etc
Honestly i don't even know whats the meaning of some of the words but in spanish everything is made off swear words, and everything can be used for swearing
" Me la pela " CATALAN
"me la suda" SPANISH
The first one doesn't have meaning itself and the second one is like "you're sweating of it"
Another very commonly used is "me da igual" that roughly would translate to the English expression "It's all the same to me".
Spanish is very rich in this kind of expressions about not giving a shit
Como si te la pica un pollo
Other common variation: me la pela/me la trae floja
More classical expressions: me importa un bledo/pito/pimiento/comino
"Me importa/no me importa un/tres pepino" - "I care/I don't care a/three cucumber".
"Me importa/no me importa una mierda" - "I care/I don't care a shit"
There’s also “Me importa entre cero y nada” which would translate to “I care between cero and nothing”
Oh, I forgot
Love that one <3
To put it in context, it's used when someone tells you something about him that you don't care at all you can reply "por mí como si te la pica un pollo" and it could be roughly translated as "for me as if a chicken bites you(r dick)" the dick part is again implied
For what is worth, it's perfectly possible to hear (from women) the expression "Me suda el coño" (It sweats off my cunt) instead of "Me suda la polla"
Thanks for explaining :)

Do people support regimes changes in the Middle east

Also, Catalan is the language, Catalonia is the region name in English, Catalunya in Catalan

Because you are probably way richer than most of the other people living in Spain, no one will feel sorry because you are not oppressed, it has at most 50% of support in your own region, and spain has been developing Catalonia and Basques as economic and industrial centres for a long time, and when it goes better for you than the rest because of that you think better to keep the good stuff and leave
I think that's not how it works, feels like a treason, backstab direct to the heart
Greetings from the poorest region of Spain, Cádiz, where we work more time for less money and live happily feeling the privilege of living in a developed country
What does one thing have to do with the other
In any case, who says they don't support a "peaceful democratic" process
There just haven't been one
The former attempts were illegal, therefore not democratic, therefore not supported
In any case, Spain is a very important member in the EU
They won't risk pissing us off "just" for a region which is about 50% pro-independence and 50% pro-unity
And these numbers can sway quick
Rembember these things are highly politicized and public opinion is easily manipulated by media
Thank you
Some uninformed internet people just read the words "peaceful" and "democratic" and go at our throats as if we were evil oppressors for not letting a happy hippy peaceful democratic independence
As if the situation was that easy and categorically simple
Yeah, reality is far from that
> To me it looks less like "Catalonia wants independence" and more like "some Catalonians want independence, no matter what the rest of them think".
We'll never know, because Spain and its European allies don't support a peaceful democratic process to decide it
> Because Catalonians aren't oppressed in any way comparable to people in some countries in the Middle East
It's completely insane to pretend Catalonians have it as bad as Libyans under Khaddafi or Syrians under Assad for example
Yeah, who cares about [arbitrary detentions] and [a few hundreds of injured people] without legal consequences
Let's set a threshold comfortable enough to avoid inconveniences to our allies
> As soon as the Spanish Prime Minister orders a deadly poison gas attack against Barcelona, Europe will support independence of Catalonia, I'm sure of it
LMAO
50% /  50% It changes a lot depending on what the central government does
Support for independence is currently at 44% [according to official polls]
Catalan is also the adjective and the name for people living in Catalonia
I agree
That wording is questionable bordering on dishonest
I mean, while I agree that the 1O was totally disgusting, the Yes won because most of the people that do not want the independence didn't vote
And the 12 politicians are in prison because they broke the law, not just because they "allowed people to vote". Everyone knew that was going to happen (Catalan parliament lawyers specifically said it multiple times), and they did it anyways So they got what everyone told them they would get
I'm not contrary to another referendum, but it has to be a legal referèndum, not that "thing" that was 1O and the previous one
And as usual, you are only telling the half of the story that is on your interest
Half trues are lies, so you are basically lying

HRE 2: Electric Boogaloo
“Now with extra states
That's exactly what I mean
There hasn't been one because they were all illegal
Actually, that’s the part Catalans keep out of conversations: they don’t want EVERYONE to vote, because if the whole country had to vote on this topic, the majority would vote for Catalonia to stay in Spain
The reason the vote was prohibited by Spain’s highest court, is because they couldn’t allow a referendum on something that would breach other Spaniards’ constitutional rights
We Spaniards all have the right to the land of Spain
If A part of the country would want to break apart, they would need the constitution to be changed, and for that you need a majority of all Spaniards
It was an illegal referendum, the president told Catalans to not vote at all
> The high court of Catalonia ruled the elections illegal too
There's a unified judicial system in Spain with multiple seats across the Spanish territory, including Catalonia
What you call "the rule of the high court of Catalonia" is nothing else than a decision coming from Spain itself
> EU countries tend to support the rule of law in other EU countries
If a peaceful democratic process is in violation of the law, the rule of law is preferred, since the laws themselves are seen as the product of legitime peaceful democratic process
You're totally right
That's why Catalonia tried it by its own limited means and it didn't work
And that's why I was asking a for legal peaceful democratic process favored by Spain and with the international pressure of its neighbors if needed
So that's basically your argument against a UN report denouncing how Spain is contravening several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
We can know with a margin of error
People voting is not the only way to know people's support on different things
Read [my explanation] tldr; "mandatory voting" is  showing up, not actually voting
disclaimer: not aussie
What you say sounds fair, but we already have a solution for that
It's called "Elecciones Generales". It's the country-wide election where we vote people in that decide on country-wide policy
There is no need for a person of Madrid to decide on de healthcare, education or roads of people in the Canary Islands
What we non-Catalans are defending is the right to Catalonia's land
We can freely move/work there and the separatists would take that away from us, without changing the constitution first
> Doesn't Spain have independent judicial branch
Well, not really according to the Council of Europe
[[1]] [[2]] [[3]] And the public perception is even worse
[[1]] (sorry, source in Spanish only, you can find a rough translation [here]
> it is not the role of governments, who state they respect the rule of law, to endorse civil disobedience and civil unrest in their democratic allied countries
I've explicitly talked in my previous comment about encouraging a legal referendum, not civil disobedience
I'm a bit "eh" on the idea
I know a lot of voters that have really strong ideas and know a bit of the politics but, at the end of the day, they forget or just end up not voting
On the other side, a lot of elders would have to go and probably have their vote chosen for them
Well, it is I guess
Having someone have to show up drastically increases the change of voting, but it's not a 100% change anyways
I don't know if this counts, but in Reddit I get that "¿Dónde está la biblioteca

"Usted" (polite version of "you") started declining its use in Spain in the last decades of the 20th century and everyone uses "Tú" instead except in specific situations
In mainland spain "usted" is seen as too respectful or old fashioned, while its still pretty common in latinamerica
Spaniards might seem rude or too direct to latinos because of this
We also dont say "Gracias" (thank you) for everything as commonly as brits for instance

Good
who voted against this
Is this a real problem
Normally you buy a phone and get a cable with it you need
The last 4-5 phones I owned all had the same cable but I always used the the one that came with the phone
I just don't think we need a regulation for this
No cable
I don't have any cable that I don't need
My phone is almost 3 years old and the cable is about to snap
I have 3 cables and adapters and sometimes they aren't enough
Not bringing a cable and adapter with phone would be a big nono for me
My parents get by with only one cable and adapter for their phone and tablet so I guess it depends on the person
>1) packaging a proprietary cable to millions of device no matter if it gets used or not
This already happens I have a Samsung, my brother a Huawei we use the same cable
Apple is shit anyway and they have a huge retention rate (92%), also 70% won't consider other brand
>2) you buy the cable that you need 1 or 2 times
What cable do you need two times
You use it every day for years
>If you want to argue about you are getting scammed for the cable, because it no longer is in the package and you still pay the same, fuck yes
So be it
It is an 3 $ article
But please see these cables rolled out to a million times, they are just producing garbage
Try to get away from your 3$ problem and see the larger picture
A fast charging adpater+cable costs about 35€ on the official site
I stand with what I said: this vote was unnecessary because nobody has a problem when buying a new phone having to switch cables
Good old USB type A.
But they voted for everybody making the same cable; which, mostly, they already did
This has nothing to do with the amount of cables you have
Manufacturers are still going to produce the same amount of cables they do now because people need them
If you are hoarding cables at home that you don't use is because of an old phone not one you brought today
Having tons of cables isn't a thing people do now
ETA: If you don't want the cable and adapter that comes with your phone just ask your friends if they want it or put it on ebay for free
Are you 60
You have multiple devices you need multiple cables
Those **cables already have the same port** but you still need more than one

Are really that much of a "straw need"?
I haven't used a straw for more than a decade
Drink it from the cup, it's not that difficult
I got a pasta straw a few months back in an iced coffee from a cafe in Berlin
Never had seen it before
Ok, these are my conclusions:
-Lots of people who drink so much soda that their teeth are dying
-People how *need* to multitask everything, thus spill their drink all over the place
-People who doesn't like the cream moustache, wtf guys
That's like the number 1 reason to take that kind of drinks
-Lots of bearded men without hankies, like a lot of them
-Disabled people, this I understand
-And the honour place for the unmentioned, the astronauts, those I forgive for using straws
The thing is that for most of that cases the change in behaviour is the better solution in every aspect
Also it's difficult depending on the behaviour and the person
For instance I quit sodas when I was 18yo, and haven't drink any for a decade now, easiest thing ever, don't miss them at all
But I cannot freaking sit in a good posture not for all the gold in the world, I tried for decades but it's impossible for me
Any person have their weaknesses and their strengths
But the thing is that everyone should at least TRY to change a harmful behaviour, if it's too hard to change then we can talk about the complex solutions, but most people don't even try

I dislike referendums because I see them as a trick used by politicians to reduce a complex problem into a false dichotomy
But the entire point of electing a political class is, precisely, that complex issues must be resolved by talks based on nuances
At the very least, referendums should be done using multiple transferable vote and a variety of options, reflecting the most common positions of the population
As always, the one posing the question has a huge advantage, but with multiple options that influence is reduced

The idea that it's a subsidy to not add the environmental cost when there's really not much agreement to what that cost should be and then just state the absolute number they come up with as fact seems dubious at best
I agree there should be a carbon tax but the ideas of what the real externality cost is vary by orders of magnitude

I've always found it curious how pro-gay marriage we are
We're still a pretty strongly Catholic country
I'm an agnostic now, but when I considered myself Christian I never thought being pro-gay marriage and being a Christian couldn't go together, but most other religiously devout European countries aren't like that
Ancient Italy was really great
That is some power-washing porn right there

Calling the EU left, is the most stupid thing I've heard today
But they are very pro-european Spain-sceptic parties
They do want independence from Spain and a membership in the EU

It's treason, then
This is why there's so many people flocking from Eastern Europe :\

However these working conditions are normal for Eastern Europe
Is it normal in some European countries to have "newspapers" that look like gossip magazines but with political news
I bet you guys drive there every day and for you it’s all “*meh, same old boring landscape*” while for us it’s like “*OMG

Well, Poland is full of nazis so this doesnt surprise me at all
Also, poland has some history of nazi collaboration
Wonderful
To give you an example of how far Spain is of having affordable train tickets, it's usually cheaper to drive a car and park in the destination for one person than to take a train and then use public transport in the destination city for that same person
There is so much to be changed in this matter
EU is already trying to do that, but it's really tricky to manage lines between countries, cause differences in interest and sharing of costs
Also  many countries have national train companies and they want to 'protect' their business
I live in London and going to Paris by flight is cheaper than train, it's absurd
I love trains and I love arriving straight into the city rather than having to take shuttles to and from the airport
If tickets were the same or less, I would go by train 100% of the time
Lol, who doesn't hate the US, I mean, its 2020
Is there one like this but for China
I think everybody knows that if you're rich or way above average, the US is one of the best places, if you're average or below (wealthwise) you're better off in Europe
As an european, I must say that this graph says absolutely nothing
Lol, we are not the ones who always are bragging about ourselves
Another country more to carry the torch, yay
Votes, share and turnout in the last 10 years of presidential (Pres
), and parliamentary (Parl
) elections²:
- 2012 Parl
: 165,380 votes (45
60%, 70
56% turnout)
- 2013 Pres
: 161,940 votes (51
21%, 63,90% turnout)
- 2016 Parl
: 158,490 votes (41
41%, 73
33% turnout)
- 2018 Pres
: 180,272 votes (53
90%, 63,92% turnout)
- 2020 Parl
: 142,956 votes¹ (34
8%, 75
9% turnout)
*¹ Votes estimated based on preliminary results
*² The results are just the ones for the ECG and their candidates, not taking into account allies or who is the candidate
Looks like turnout was not essential this time, but the loss of more than 15k votes (~9
8% of the party's support in 2016)
Turnout helped, but it was "just" following the trend, and probably wouldn't have been enough if the ECG had kept it's share of votes
Edit: apparently their allies got only 3 of the 7 representatives lost by the ECG and the Croatian minority, so (if I'm reading the alliances right) those 4 representatives won by the sum of the opposition parties at the expense of the government coalition are the actual key to the possibility of a new majority
So, again, turnout has helped but apparently the key was the change of behaviour in the ECG 2016 voters; either switching to the opposition, not voting or changing parties inside the government coalition (final data would be needed to analyse exactly what happened)
One step closer towards a brighter future
Turnout in 2016 was 388,220 [according to DIK] so it's an increment of around 22,500, not 80/90,000
He was just saying that turnout was not the key factor, but a big loss of supporters

I know I will get downvoted, but, it is do clear that abortion is a human right
Because I can't understand how the difference between a baby being inside a woman or not changes an action from human right to a terrible murder
I am not saying that abortion should be banned, only that if Polish people have democratically chosen a prolife party, maybe their opinion should be respected
It was a cruel invasion
Today, England is descended from great warriors who have overcome numerous vicious invasions
Some of the things he's immediately planning on doing upon resuming office
> He will rejoin the Paris climate accords, according to those close to his campaign and commitments he has made in recent months, and he will reverse President Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization
He will repeal the ban on almost all travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and he will reinstate the program allowing “dreamers,” who were brought to the United States illegally as children, to remain in the country, according to people familiar with his plans
Hopefully this is the first step towards more cooperation between US and us
Hope this new president don't start a war too
Even though I'm glad that the US will have a better president now, I still think that we need to be way more independent from the US
Americans could choose another candidate like Trump and we'll be back in no time to the last 4 years
When dictatorships like Russia or Belarus claim your election is "a mockery to democracy" you know you had a fair election
>Biden won by the thinnest of margins
That is just not true
He got 4 million more votes and he is projected to win the EC 306 vs 242, exactly how Trump won last election
Still better than Trump
Puerto Rico, despite the skewed results of the consultations, doesn't have a particularly high interest in becoming a state, nor in my opinion should it
The status quo works relatively well, even with its flaws, and so it is not about to have a voice in election results in the US
I do think the trade deal (understood as free trade deal) would be hard, unless we unify our standards to the highest
Fine, fair enough
But it's not like the US is taking and abrupt turn in most areas
Climate change will be considered a problem by the government officially, unlike before, but the corresponding action isn't likely to be particularly drastic or sufficient
Is this a thing
I saw the video of CGP grey but I thought it was only a personal fantasy rather than a real thing
Also, of course democrat states are going to support it and republicam states are going to go against it, so good luck adding republican states to the list
Republicans never win the popular vote without winning the EC also
Only Democrats might win the popular vote and still lose the EC

For me it is crazy that Boris Johnson can be elected as PM without an explicit vote on the Parliament, just because it is the new leader of the most voted party
True, but Johnson hasn't been elected by the MPs, just the members of his party
As far as I know, he hasn't been approved by the Parliament, which for me it's quite shocking
He is the PM because he is the new leader of the party
This, no one elected May either
People elected the Tories AND the Tories elected May
I don't agree
He was elected as MP, but the Parliament did not vote on him as PM
I have learnt that this is apparently the UK way of doing things, but for me it is profoundly undemocratic way, as the message is that the party, and not the parliament, is the best representation of the will of the people, which is not
People voted MPs, most of which had no saying in who the new PM is
That is not being democratically elected as PM, in my opinion, even if it's the law

Trump is an**incompetent and not politically savvy ** authoritarian  yet brought the system to the point of violence and some members of  his own party propagating his lies for their own benefit
That’s not a robust system
That’s a system ready to be cooped by a more more ambitious and politically savvy authoritarian
It’s even more crazier when you realize that he lost the popular vote twice and yet got to be president once because of like less than 1% of the vote in a few states and it could have happened again had less than 1% swung the other way
There are so many things wrong with the US system with the biggest being it’s inability to respond to changes to make it’s system more democratic
Well, I think that they think of it as extremely dysfunctional as a system since they also have a system that's just as hectic
Part of the inability to modify the us political system is that too many Americans excessively rely on what they think the US system was intended to be like rather than adapting to changes
Americans mythologize the independence era way too much and are stuck partially in the past
This is a false equivalency and you know it
I don’t think the reluctance is about unintended consequences
It’s not working right now so that’s clearly not it
I think it’s simply plain old conservatism in that it’s a reluctance to change a system or part of a system because that’s how it’s always been
The most resilient countries are the ones that know when it’s time to reform their systems while the dysfunctional ones keep doing things the way they’ve always been
The US is the latter right now while a country like New Zeland would be the former
They revamped their electoral system in the 90s because it also used to be dysfunctional
Instead of talking about the issue that I raised which is a serious one, you take it personally and then start talking about something else completely
Right now it seems to be along ideological lines, if I had to choose between popular votes deciding an election or a small number of states deciding an election, I’d go with the former since it’s more democratic
If Americans keep having elections where the winner goes to the loser of the popular vote then it’s going to start to be seen as illegitimate
That’s fine if there’s a will to change it, but that probably won’t happen given how polarized the US is
When systems are rigid and people view them as illegitimate then you run into all sorts of issues
See Spain for example

Prove anti-fascism is about those things you say and not about actually being anti-fascist
The amount of arrogant ignorance you display is simply ridiculous
Again, prove you're not just spitting shit, prove antifa act as you accuse them of, prove you're not another brainwashed zombie

You're not mistaken
No, it means they would be recognized and allowed to join
Spain's stance is that an independence that isn't bilaterally agreed upon wouldn't even be recognized in the first place
That's why Spain doesn't recognize Kosovo
It would still require a new application

Sorry for that, but r/turkey has been mobilized like crazy, pushing a lot of agendas and brigading, so people are on the defensive about anyone with the turkey flair and assume they support the invasion
The invasion was unfounded and a big backstabbing considering that turkey and USA got SDF to destroy most border defenses a month to 2 weeks before the attack started in order for USA to stay protecting them, and for Erdogan to deescalate
Also turkey used those USA-turkey good will patrols to inspect all the border and prepare the invasion
The rate of green is very high
But even with that demonstration, it's still getting hot

In Spain, PP uses blue; in UK, Tories use blue; in France, the Republicans use blue
The European People's Party uses blue
I see a common trend in conservatives using blue, liberals using yellow/orange and social democrats using red

WTF title
auschwitz express
in spain, the incumbent minority socialist govt passed a random resolution to move franco's dead body to a less prominent location (44 years after his death, and having controlled govt 25+ of these democracy years)
nobody really gave a shit about franco, but this calculated political move stoked fires with the conservative voters
the result was that 10% of voters backed the openly fascist vox party in the general election
the conservative pp party now has less than half the voters as last election, in great part due to seeming likely to pact with vox after the andalucia regional election earlier this year
some of those votes went to the newer smaller centre-right ciutadans party, but mostly it was voters prioritising voting the other big party (psoe over pp) to show that they are against fascism (prioritising political sentiment over psoe's horrendous economic mismanagement during the crisis of 2008-2011)
i switched from pp to vote ciutadans, (because the new leader started talking about abortion and irrelevant shit, and because in my region catalunya, pp was losing seats to ciutadans already and i didn't want to make my vote useless)
first i regretted switching, because the result made it evident that psoe will be propped to power by ciutadans
but now i think, at least the budget will be passed on time, and perhaps the anti-franco general sentiment was more important to spain as a whole
even if this was dirty politics, and psoe are already unnerving central bank projections of a new recession and unemployment rising after 6 years of decline, perhaps a dwindling centre right propped by fascists would lead to an uglier future
thing is, fascism was never actually defeated in spain
once franco died, his chosen heir returning power to the crown decided instead to start a constitutional monarchy
in the age of extremists and nationalists, so many have forgotten that our democracy started with the biggest (and most welcome) compromise between past bitter rivals (fascists, republicans, communists, and centrists of all colours)
the entry into the eu in 1986 and especially the olympicsf 92, are *still* tear-jerking events of our history, like returning to civilisation and freedom
i don't remember where i was going with this and now it's too long and i'm sorry
thanks
also wanted to add, other than fascists, the pact with ciutadans will also escape psoe seeking support from nationalists in catalunya
the secessionist camp has been declining since "referendum", but there was a chance of a real referendum happening here if sanchez wanted power with a minority govt
i was surprised at the market rise the following monday, but i think that that's what it was about: budget pass, no fascist regression, no catalan secession
I love how this is what ends ups in the internet, and not the hundreds of giant snow dicks distributed by Madrid
It might not be as common as other countries but it snows plenty on Spain tho
Lots of mountains
You dont understand, the last time it snowed like this was more than 100 years ago
It snows a bit every year, and every 5 years or so there is a reasonably big snow storm, but this one was a first for everyone in Madrid
I seriously doubt I'll ever again see something like this here
sir i’m in this picture and I don’t like it
50 cm of heavy snow would cripple any decent sized city in Spain
Yeah, lots of mountain town have that sort of snow, but hardly in population centers

The website has collapsed
Too many people looking for the MEPs that they should yell at
We know, but sometimes you need to simplify the message to get it across and the explain it in more detail

poor europe
Praising the rethorics of someone doesn't mean to agree with his views
For example, Lenin, he delivered good speeches though he was a mass murderer
From an historical point of view I understand some people in Poland and other eastern Europe countries to be pissed about the non aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the soviets
But here in Spain we lived a whole different story
Here the liberal powers of Europe (France, UK
etc), where in a non aggression pact with Germany and Italy when fascisms invaded us
And the soviet union was the only country which fought with us against fascism
Once WW2 ended we were in the liberal zone of influence, and they pacted with our fascist dictator so we never got democracy until he died in 1977
So while I can understand the point of view of eastern countries, we (Spain and Portugal) are also part of Europe and part of the European union
And I refuse that history only get taught one way, what happened to us, and the non-aggression policies that let our people be conquered and genocided by fascism should also be known
Also we honor the people who did come to fight with us, the brave International Brigades, composed of communists from all over the world
I would never let anyone dishonour those who gave their live against fascism for the freedom of a country they didnt even belong, and even if they could get in troubles with their own government for coming

Just the exact amount that you are going to ignore the billions of people killed by the regime you support (capitalism)
For every capitalist death you ignore I would ignore one communist death
Deal
Before you answer you should remember that European capitalist power that are not "banned" in this post still had African an Asian colonies during that time
I just ask that we should be fair, communist should be compared with capitalism, not with fascism (totally different thing)
When the socialist and communist returned to Spain in the 80s they won the elections, and Spain become one of the most progressive countries in Europe in social matters (same sex marriage, gender equality laws etc
Less that the carbon footprint reduced by the billions of innocent people killed by capitalism and liberalism
Much less
Capitalism is the economic system that have killed most people in human history
But ey
, let's not take out the right of a rich guy of having slaves, that's communism and it's evil
So yes, you're just going to ignore millions of people who died under Stalin's regime
edit: btw, if you want to seriously compare communism with capitalism with actual data I recomend you Hans Rosling work
Check the effect of [the introduction of capitalism in different regions in different times]
Communism is a while spectrum of ideologies and presenting it as a unique bloc is counter to discussion
While I respect that opinion (because they did so much harm), I think they did so many good things, you know like the GLOBAL campaign for smallpox vaccination in which they sent thousands of vaccines all over the world
Anyway I'm not here to talk about the Soviet Union, nor Stalin
I'm here to talk about communism and socialism
And this current of banning those ideologies in Europe
Of course as a member of a political party member of the GUE/NGL, that only seeks a better life for everyone in Europe I'm afraid for political prosecution out of this tendency
Then you admit that you ignore the death of the capitalist regimens
I you don't ignore those inocent people deaths I won't ignore those killed by Stalin
It's you call men, do the right one
Santiago Carrillo fought in the 1936 and we was leader of the communist party when they were allowed to return in 1978
Spanish communism has always been very progressive overall
Anyway I'm not here to talk about interwar period
I'm here to talk about communism and socialism
And this current of banning those ideologies in Europe
Of course as a member of a political party member of the GUE/NGL, that only seeks a better life for everyone in Europe I'm afraid for political prosecution out of this tendency
Lmao you should really stop talking about something you know nothing about
You don't even know who Santiago Carrillo was
He fought on the Civil War and in 1978 was the leader of the communist party in the elections
So yes, they kind of were the same
I never mention Stalin, I never generalized with "all of something did something". But whatever makes you happy men ;)
As Goebbels said, "accuse your adversary of doing what you are doing, that creates confusion".
I'm just saying that if we count all crimes done under a communist regime we should take account of all crimes done under capitalist regimes
Althought I prefer that while not forgetting the past we should talk about what capitalists and communist are defending nowadays in Europe, and I assure that none of we both defend those crimes
(Of course from my point of view capitalist defend modern slavery, but it's obviously different of when they just took black people in Africa into a boat)

The pandemic only reinforces how fragile the system is in the US
If diabetes, heart disease, and cancer were contagious the U.S. would either have the best healthcare system in the world or everyone would be dead
Hopefully US learns after this that being sick is not an individual’s problem but the society as a whole
I would honestly consider the WW2 as two different "main" conflicts
* Germany vs Russia scenario in Europe
* USA vs Japan scenario in the Pacific
* Series of smaller conflicts and battles
I know this will offend many americans and brits, but if you put it into perspective, Battle of Stalingrad is still the bloodiest battle EVER fought, and nearly the same people died in that single battle than in the entire western front
The eastern front also has [the biggest tank battle] in history
&#x200B;
What the Western Front might have is the biggest air battles, with the Battle of Britain and the lesser known Battle of France
People downplay the french army, but they managed to take down more german fighters in the Battle of France than brits did in the Battle of Britain, and keep in mind that the french had WW1 tactics against german tactics that literally no one except the poles ever fought against
Well, this is true
But don't forget USA contributed the most to mantain West Europe safe from USSR, which is a relief
Germany vs Russia plus a series of smaller conflicts
Spanish civil war, the invasion of poland and france, the winter war in Finland, the battle of britain

There's a whole bunch of people in the middle
Oh man, I miss those
I spent 6 months in Poland last year because of covid and I couldn't stop eating those
Dutch IT
"Based on english language searches". Maybe Spain/Portugal should worry about what the brits are searching while on vacation
So, the conclusion I reach is that Spain and Portugal finally have reached a point where an Iberian Union has plenty of advantages
FETCH ME THEIR FLESH
I don't even know anymore
Hostal: portugal kills 'em and spain eats 'em
Slovenia: dabs furiously
But how do i learn it then
Great, now I'm hungry
Now you know
we can't let you go-
I find the polish one so wholesome lol
We are just trying to innovate with new tapas and pintxos
If the questions are in English those are guiris, so British or German

We are partners in crime
Hey bud, wanna be my friend
This just got too real
I pity our northern european bros that have no AC because it rarely gets this hot
Madrid melts every summer but most (modern) houses have AC
Enjoy being Spanish for a summer
But you have to taste at least once Madrid's summer nights (above 30°)
Fucking disgusting, i cant even go out
Roght now im in milan, but im flying tonight to mallorca and lets see if its the same shit
Madrid has been like living in actual hell flames this July
So if you are thinking this place in North West Spain with a max of 18
2 is blessed, I tell you we are actually kinda pissed off seeing everyone else at the beach
Today it was better in Northern Spain
It was very hot during the day but now in the evening, it's cooler
Plus since it's dryer an evaporative cooler works well
Bad idea
Just saying
Probably the same group that builds those siderosds and parks are also building garajes under other name
The **paradox of tolerance** states that if a society is [tolerant] without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant
[Karl Popper] described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that "In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance
" Popper expands upon this, writing, "I do not imply for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would be most unwise
But we should claim the *right* to suppress them if necessary even by force
France represents all of us who believe in freedom
French people should be proud of living in a country that defends the values that our societies should be built upon
May the victims rest in peace
Rest in peace
May extremism end and the world progress past barbaric acts
Lets wait for our Russian friends to explain why this was Not Russia^^TM

Yeah, I haven't encountered actual bots in Reddit, we should stop using that term
It's up for debate if the pro-Putin users are being paid or not (I don't think so) but they are clearly real people
If you want to find real bots they are in Twitter
Edit: I understand that there are bots that focus on posting and upvoting/downvoting but I was talking about the users who engage in debates in the comments
Ahh man, the CIA got me again

Lmao why are we the naughty ones and why is Italy trying to kill us

Now is the smallest
Also Madrid
I live in the mountains that you see in the background
From there, the towers look like an UFO power plug or something like that
I really miss the flat horizon
At night are worse
Madrid deserves to be called the most beautiful city in the world
Ì can't tell if the photo is shopped
The mountains in this photo look like the alps
None of the mountains in here have a high enough elevation to have rocky tops devoid of trees
The mountains are not visible this clearly from the Four Towers either since they run southwest to northeast in a semi-circle in the northern half of the region
The towers on the other hand are in the north eastern edge of the city center
There are still kilometers of city and other feeder cities before you get to the mountains
The birds also look really big
It's not  so bad once you get to plaza castilla and the new development should help
But yeah i always think of them as next to plaza castilla but it's an annoyingly far walk

There are a few famous art deco buildings in Madrid but I really wouldn’t say that most of Madrid is art deco
The petition of the german people to do this again, only this time with he whole of Berlin, is already being processed

As far as I know, Merkel speaks Russian pretty decently
She was ~~born and~~ raised in East Germany

She still was raised there
Thank you for the correction
Thank you for the correction
Looks straight up from Star wars
Not surprised Germans and French find this picture warm and fuzzy since they fancy themselves as the rulers of Europe
It feels weird in both ways
When I have been working in Finland during winter I feel like going to bed at 22:00 and at 16:00 I cannot believe we still have one hour more to work when it has been dark for so long
In summer: "I should go to bed, but I am not tired
What do you mean it is 2:30
". I cannot go to bed before 1 or 2 in the morning because my body is not yet ready to sleep
Caffe doppio macchiato senza zucchero, prego latte freddo
That is not a Fiat Multipla
I love that meme
It is actually a thing, I have been in Rome like four times now, and most ppl just say espresso or, 'buon giorno, un capuccio, prego', and I really love how talkative they are
But sometimes, and I mean often appears somebody that has to chat with the barman for two minutes to ask for a coffee and a pastry
In Spain we have (disregarding bad coffee) a lot of times of coffee but it is just like pim-pam
Get a place and shout "cortado y con leche
Sacarina please
" Two coffees, three seconds
I can understand why some ppl does not like spaniards lol

I really wish the stand of the EU agaisnt Chinese shenaningans were more strong, but I guess economy can't face that
Totally a stunt
Anyway, I'd say most German politicians share those views
This is just a tryhard propaganda for her party
I love it
I like that you tried to imitate the style as close as possible
I am all for new takes and renditions, but there is something very interesting in close emulation too
I had in my mind plenty of ideas
From one of the apartments in which I used to live, I had a view like this from the Alhambra
I might try to do a version myself
There are so many bad people in the world
That some people are blaming the victims in this thread is evidence of how low some people can go
The very ones trying to excuse this have probably done it at various points in their lives
I hope she and her family get the help they need and people develop enough humanity to leave them alone
Oh ok so freedom of speech for you but not for me
Edit: I don’t support the oil industry and believe we need to love towards renewables and nuclear but using the market not by destroying it
She is right, though, and doing something about it
She´ll be remembered for helping spark this new push that will result in massive changes in developed countries by 2050
Have fun with your offensive memes
Is noone going to point out the ridiculous ram they are using
That thing couldn't open my bathroom

The OG fascist too
My great grandfather fought for the nazis willingly in the USSR
Spain was devastated after the civil war, he had experience as a soldier after 3 years of fighting and nazis paid well (about 45
000 spaniards fought for them), so well that in 2015 I read that some veterans were still being paid by Merkel's government, nothing wrong with that, war is war
Although I have to say that spaniards thought they were fighting communism and they fought only against the USSR, never against the allies
And there were reports of fights between spaniards and germans because of the treatment germans gave to war prisoners and jews
Moscow is a city full of green land

greens: 44 seats, with the leader's seat in ... wait for it ... bavaria
I'm surprised it isn't all China
Those people are everywhere in Europe all year round
That’s not really accurate about France
A lot French people do go to England but it’s mostly like either North-Westerners going on a pub crawl or immigrant families visiting the family in UK
Real French people, go to Spain, Italy, or Netherlands and complain how France is better

Shame that this part wan't implemented
It really isn't that big for its population

One shopping centre where I live is [shaped like a boat] Inside there are play grounds for kids in forms of pirate octopus or ships

Thta sounds awesome
If you have any info on how to sign up, would you mind sharing it here
Wow, that's really cool, where is that
Both in Coruña, the shaped like a boat is [Espacio Coruña] and the one with the octopus park is [Marineda City] (one of the biggest shopping centres in Spain)
They are like 5min apart
[Everything is Españita
] Spain went crazy with this game just look at the comments
The memes where great
Someone even did a Spain Civil War with the Provinces, but we don't talk about it because La Rioja won
Honey this is Spain, everyone wants to be “not Spain “. It’s what brings us together as a country, along with garlic and olive oil
Wait, La Rioja won
How is that even possible
I often forget they even exist
At least we got great wine
we made something similar in southern spain in order to preserve the endangered iberian lynx and avoid them getting ran over
As far as I know this was the attack with most victims on euroean soil
The far right as always are  talking about national terrorism and ignoring islamofascist, and Diaz Ayuso is doing another circus
Poor victims
how is it "so clearly" a muslim group
Spain was being massacred by ETA
If 11M was the first attack of AlQaeda, who would've known
In this specific case, I think it was for retaliation
That was months after Spain joined Irak war aligned with USA and UK
Not really, there's a lot of terror attacks you won't have heard about
Jihadist cell
Alquaeda followers apparently
No veto, so the Spanish government will be able to do whatever it wants with the money
More useless subsidies, benefits and associations for friends of people in the government, to buy their votes and stay in power forever
The Spanish worker and entrepreneur won't see a cent of that money
Only time will tell
But I do think is a good deal for all europeans
It would be absolutely terrible if some of the most populated countries in Europe collapsed, it would bring the whole Union and all its members down
Together we thrive
And to stay together we need all our parts to be strong
So I do think that in 5-10 years from now we will be very happy about the results of this deal
Where are all those dutchs that attacked me again and again for saying this would eventually happen and they kept telling me that they would always block it
To be fair part of the deal is to keep human rights and EU values in check
I don't know how it will be enforced, but I hope it's a step to make those countries to truly follow the European values, rights and liberties
The rule is that we keep having euros as our currency so german exports can be diluted so their currency doesn't get appreciated and they can be even more competitive
Did you really think they wouldn't give us the money when they are the ones that get the most out of it
Look at the countries that get the most out of the eurozone  [ , look where Germany, Ireland and Benelux are
Do you really think they want to go back to a divided europe when they are the ones most benefited
Lol, they will give us money to shut us up
And we will be stupid enough to take the money and keep being poors, diluting your currency instead of fighting for our own currency and monetary policy
This
And it's not like they give well reasoned arguments or even keep a facade of civility, this thread just went full stereotypical populist "they're stealing for us

Wut
Marxist
Are you delusional
A Vox alert has been activated and we're all following the protocol
Please unwary european bystander, keep your distance with this comment and avoid any kind of mention of usual trigger points like LGBT rights, dictatorships, quarantines or any Spanish community with a regional language
It seems so
We are going with more of a "marshall plan" approach
It was certainly much more effective
*What a childish fantasy*
> Far left
You and I have a very distinct definition of "far left"
PSOE-Podemos is center left at BEST
I'm not, but you're clearly the kind of idiot who calls Podemos government marxist
Also all of my points apply to a Cs voter
You just have to ask your countrymen that think that yesterday deal was "free money for the south" and they would be better off alone
The truth is we're not the ones benefited and 2008 and 2020 crisis were even worse for us because the euro currency has weakened our economy
By the way, I'm not saying the South has no responsability for our situation, I'm saying the north is not doing us a favor as a lot of northerners tend to think
Podemos' government has nothing marxist to it, you can screech as much as you want
It's a progressive political party respectful of the Constitution and the Monarchy, otherwise they would have never got to where they are and agreed with who they agreed with
And I'm not here to teach you what the governments Cs supports with the extreme right is doing and saying regarding LGBT rights or their own stance on Francoism or different nationalisms that aren't theirs, but I recommend you to get in touch with reality every now and then so you know who you're voting to
Have a great day
Let's put 2008 crisis as an example, when we had 28% unemployment rate, in 2011, with our own currency we could have devaluated our currency so german, british and other european tourists could find our country more attractive/cheaper instead of going to Turkey, Egypt, etc
The same with SEAT, Volkswagen, and other car companies would have mantained or even open more fabrics in Spain since the price of employees would be cheaper
Same happens with literally any company
Instead of that we're stuck in the euro so we can do nothing of that and we have had 10 years of unemployment over 15%, that's something no country can resist
Euro currency helps strong economies while destroys the ones that are struggling and have less infrastructure
No wonder why countries like Poland or Czech Republic are doing so well lately and don't want to hear anything about joining the eurozone
Considering how Spanish politics function as if they were a football match and your clearly biased comment towards the government, I was just letting the European audience know that you would shit on our government for a penny and that your opinion "as a Spanish person" should be taken with a grain of salt
Comparing countries with <10% unemployment and some of them in development recieving a shit ton of money from european funds (eastern europe) with Spain that had 28% unemployment rate and it was close to 0% in the funding balance (0
17% of the GDP last year, and we will be net contributors in a year or two)
Ok, whatever
I cannot prove it because it hasn't happen
But I think it's obvious that if you devalue your currency and your products become cheaper for your neighboors to buy, you'll sell more, so your unemployment rate will go down
But if you have the same currency that your neighboor has, then you're fucked and we will be in a spiral of unemployment and debt that we can never get out
Our debt gets bigger because we have a lot of people unemployed that we cannot let live on the streets so we have to help them and we can't get enough money because there's a point where even if you push your taxes up, you don't get more money from your citizens/companies (Laffer curve),
So with that huge debt and the money that we need to invest in not having people living on the streets we cannot use the money to help companies to grow up and hire more people
So companies won't grow, there won't be more employment rate, internal demand won't grow, with no more internal demand companies don't have a reason to grow and so on
The spiral of missery that will never end for us the southerners
Meanwhile every 6-10 years we will have a big crisis that will lead to a big deal like the one we had yesterday that won't have any benefit long term
It's our fault
Yes, mostly, it's our fault that we started the cycle (1992-2007 bubble) but it's not our fault that we're stuck in it (2012 onwards)
Can we solve it having the euro as our currency
I highly doubt it
What's the solution
There are a few options in my opinion:
\-Keep going on with the same strategy of injecting money until the debt is so big that everything explodes
\-Further integration, but that would mean taxes from richer countries going to pay infrastructure on poorer countries
\-Desintegration, but that would mean a default for southern countries, since if our currencies go down in value it's obvious that we won't be able to pay our debts in euros
\-2 euro currencies, one for the north, one for the south, that can fluctuate in value, so if the south needs to cheapen its prices we can do it
The same as before but if the currencies of the south are united it's more likely that we can mantain an stable value and pay at least part of the debt, so it wouldn't be a 100% default
What’s funny is that even in my Catholic private school in France, it’s was 100% normal to criticize the church and catholics in general
And it’s completely normal to do it in public
Some of it is fair and some of it is unfair
Catholicism is seen as the thing that prevents France from progressing and evolving but somehow Islam is immune from it
There is this ridiculous code of silence in France where Islam isn’t talked about in any “negative” manner
It’s something only racist people do, or a British or American thing
There will be a speech and everyone will forget it happened and when elections come people
will wonder why a far-right party keeps winning seats in the assembly
Cheer up, France
must defeat the evil deeds of the wicked
OP is defending the murder of a Muslim in the hands of skinheads of the French National Front as the result of a "street brawl", and refusing to condemn that murder as right wing terrorism
Right now I'm really disappointed at this sub moderation
Heavenly thinking about reporting it to Reddit administration
Notice that OP was recently banned on r/France
Downplayed the murder of a Muslim man by skinheads as a "brawl", and actually refused to acknowledge the existence of far-right terrorism ever existing in France
I've seen people banned here by much less, IDK what's happening right now
Edit: I forgot, he also engaged any Muslim user that replied to the post condemning the attack, and insulted them and their faith directly and viciously, this comments I think he deleted them himself but should be still reachable in his post history
1995, in the French National Front terrorist attack, also in Paris
Not him, but
The French National Front members plotted the killing of an human being for being muslim
Do with that information whatever your morality allows you to do with it
Just before midday, a small group splintered away from the National Front parade
Media reports would later describe the four men as skinheads
They reportedly came to the Carrousel Bridge in search of homosexuals to harass
Instead, they found Bouarram
Lawyers for 19-year-old Mickael Freminet would argue that Bouarram hurled insults at him
That Bouarram’s death was unintentional
That Freminet was not, in fact, a skinhead
But what was undeniable was that Freminet gave Bouarram a shove, in full view of passersby
Bouarram fell into the water
Freminet and his companions watched as he drowned
Wonderful people those who belong to the French National Front, aren't they
Wonderful people
>I am muslim myself
>I fled from my homecountry precisely because I don't want to live under Sharia and all that bullshit
then why are you a muslim if you don't follow muslim laws
>These radicals and their supporters needs to be kicked out, I don't understand why europeans are such pussies
This could backfire for you, you either kick the muslims or you don't, radicals usually don't support the jihad in public
You are now a guy who said "it was a murder that started with a brawl".
The facts
The French National Front

You might not be in Spain but in Mallorca, a well known German land
Toss them in the pool
I'm Spanish
I'd gladly let germans take our country if that means they can fix our gov problems
omg
I guess this picture is taken in Mallorca
We live mostly off of tourismo here, and about 60-70% of the tourists are either German or Brits, and hotels prefer germans since they are not so
How to say this without offending anybody
Not so savage
I mean most brits come here to drink and party while germans also do so but they don't lose control so often
So in Mallorca germans have some privileges
Ooohh oh oh ok
Are those funny memes
I think ours is the commiest non commie flag (red and yellow but not a star, like China, Vietnam, USSR, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia)
Some people here (but most of our redditors) would like to change it for the republican version (replacing the lower red stripe for a purple one) but I think that would just look like a 90º flipped Romanian flag (which itself already looks like Moldova's, Andorra's and Chad's)
No, no, no, see
Only British countries allowed
Other countries run by little girls
Britain stronk and very very special
People surprised that brexit actually had consequences
Maybe next time they should think before casting a ballot
Only a brit deals in absolutes
In the North it was perceived more as "They want to steal our money

WW1 didn't end, Germany kept fighting on eastern europe
The point was fighting back against other empires
It literally was expected to be a regular war, but technology had advanced to a point any war would be a bloodbath
In terms of wars on the world in total number, probably more afterwards, since empires didn't fight that many wars

If I knew little about the city, was in the area, and trying to decide on my next random stop, I would probably chose Taranto just for the name
Don't worry, some of them *do* stay quiet at night
On the ceiling of your bedroom
Watching you sleep
Really hard to live here in Milan

You can socialise with us in the swimming pool, the natural environment of the Spaniard in summer
For some countries coffee is a beverage that is meant to be enjoyed and it's quality is judge by its taste
For other countries coffee is just a drug, and it's quality is judge by its potency
My same reaction
For all the fuss about how Finns love their coffee, the ones I have tasted are absolutely terrible
>So, strong coffee that's light roast = battery acid
Finally someone gives me an explanation
That is exactly what I got
I like black coffee without sugar so you can understand my surprise when I went to Finland and they offered me
that
I think it is an acquired "taste", however
It still tastes terrible, but there is a part of me that actually enjoys the utter bitterness of it
In Germany I have seen both in equal parts
In Finland, mostly milk in my experience
Turbo based
But did he lived or did they fart in his dick
When does the corona crisis ever end
What's with that 2nd reich flag lol
I know, it's a joke
Ma que cazzo e esto, porca miseria
Germany is currently the most powerful country in Europe except for military force
But later Spain will catch up
Is that money accumulated in all the year combined or every year going to the eu
I mean, there's "supposed", and then there's "what actually happens".
You see that decrease in renewables nearing 2018 in Spain
*José Manuel Soria*
Spain is perfectly balanced
Just as everything should be
Can Denmark do something wrong please
It's starting to be annoying already
(Just kidding, ofc)
I don't get why we are so fat
We have a great food culture, are main producers of vegetables and fruits and we like to be outside a lot
What do y'all think
Oh, the Middle East must be a fat area
More like a myth than a real thing, at least for the majority of the population (we can't sleep in an office)
Siesta is great on weekends, though
Also, I think it's a good thing, not something it makes you get fatter
Tea is a very big thing in arab/muslim cultures, just as big as in slavic/eastern European ones
Or in some east Asian countries
Any statistics on cancer, sexual assault, diabetes
Who needs healthcare, education, or equality when you have MONEY
7 billions is unsustainable
We have to slow down
5 is sustainable
Wow, calm down, I just happen to think that way, I'll look it up and check if I'm not right, but meanwhile you breath a couple times ok
maybe a little bit too based
Oh that aint good
As far as I know theres one in Italy (Trieste I think)
How can you say something never happened when you can literally visit one within your country
Oh, Scandinavia, you are adorable
I wish we had 26C, we have to bear a freezing 15C down here
For us we have the best temperature right now, it's going to last about a month, then the sun will fuck you up good
We can exchange German and British tourists
Our side of the bridge looks like a great place to put a nuclear waste deposit
For reference
Portugal is a spin-off of Galicia, m9
The confict was already fixed
Portuguese officials confirmed that the site was secure a few weeks ago
They only have to do that because building a new one is a political shitstorm which is a shame
New plants are far superior to old plants and by being against new plants, they are just ensuring old, less safe plants continue operating
Also, 3) We are dumping that shit in the middle of our country
It is 100 Km from the Portuguese border, and it is closer to Madrid than Lisbon
Its' not our fault the Iberian peninsula is not the size of Siberia
Not for predictable baseload
I never dreamed that there would be such a place in Georgia, and the pace of development is enormous
Holy shit what happened
Oh, you guys finish roads down there
Surprised to see a New Zealender in r/europe
Curious as to why a person from the other side of the world be interested in the intricacies of the European States
Georgians are so friendly that Putin wants some in Russia
the end of the greatest nation in human history
I see you are a man of culture as well
Only for curiosity, what is their point of view on Italian and spanish people
Nice graph
Thanks for your time
it's their choice, pay or pay more
I was like "Nice, about time we get El Bierzo back". Then I look at the legend and saw that we are in the Mediterranean or worse Catalans (because we like being liked)
Like wtf
I'm not offended, just confused
Wtf is that spanish map
Also where is portugal lmao
Is catalonia on the wrong place on purpose
I’m offended you forgot Paid Vasco
Lol you got spain all wrong
Galicia is where you placed Catalunya, where Galicia is mentioned in south east spain is the most far right reactionary part of the country
And basques will pretty pissed off you omitted them
Sooo good job I guess
Same thing with Catalonia
This map is infuriating, well done OP
Instead of Bene, he should have called it Little Turkey
I drive both on the left and the right pretty regularly, it's really not that bad, you get used to ti really quick
Though I do prefer automatic rather than shifting with my left hand
The annoying thing is never knowing which side is the indicator and which side is the windshield controls
Asian cars tend to reverse everything so the indicator is on the right while European made cars tend to just transpose the controls to the other side so indicator is on the left
But there's no rule about it
No one talks about it because there are many people burning and vandalising things
We’re talking about it now
Petit con
The problem is that when you make such a shitty article so full of lies and misinformation, you hurt your own objectives
I have a video in Youtube with a soundtrack for which I have a licence
I received a copyright claim and they allowed me to keep the video but the revenue goes to them (TBH, I think it doesn't have any revenue)
I appealed and basically Youtube came back almost instantly rejecting the appeal telling me that I could appeal again if I disagreed, but that if I continued appealing copyright claims and they kept rejecting them they would consider it an abuse and they would lock my Google account
including my Gmail account
Congrats from Spain i’m 21% greek and hope to see to see the country soon
That looks like a very soft brexit
I think there should be a bigger margin to actualy do any change
Making a change as drastic as Brexit based on just a 2% seems too weak of a difference to do any significant change, based on the feelings people had in a particular moment in time
Probably, needing at least a 60% of the votes to move forward with that significant change would be better, since more people seem quite convinced about it
Also, what the reporter is saying, I think it makes sense if after getting to leave, they dont have the chance in the future to vote to join back
Then it would be a "lets vote until I get my result and then we never ask again"
Yep, we give them money, but we also recognized the independence of a part of his country (not my country in particular, but most of the EU) I wonder why they don’t love us
what the hell is a serbia
It's funny how people don't see further than "fire = hot, so dj_chapz = wrong, so I downvote him"
They see thousands of fires throwing smoke to the atmosphere and nothing rings a bell for them
Even the same article says that climate change will make things worse
You don't fool us Elon, this is retaliation for the Top Gear review
The UK has suffered a huge loss from the Brexit decision
also the fact that you have massive amounts of oil that no other country in western Europe has
OK, I'm sorry for this community
The right wing majority are fiercely invested in the cold war propaganda of Russia=soviet union=bad
So they hate Russia even after the 1990s liberalization disaster, essentially allowing anti-west politicians like putin to rise
And the eastern Europeans found that the best way to keep a strong nationalism blind enough to hide local problems and unite the population is to point at external enemies and demonize them
So they hate you too
So those 2 large groups in this sub hate everything Russian except what attempts to break Russia from the inside (navalny gets their support while being a useful controversial asset)
"You see, Belgrade and it's civilians were asking for it"
Exactly
No, not everyone can make their wealth through holocaust gold, Switzerland is lucky they got off the hook despite trading with Nazis
Nuclear war threats intensify
I have never, ever, visited a city with a huge pedestrian/car restricted zone and think "wow, I wish this was not here". On the contrary, I always find that it gives the cities so much more live and beauty for its inhabitants
It takes political will and some years to get used to it, to change behaviors, routines, etc, but there is no go back, in the same way that there is no go back to smoking in a hospital or a plane
The floating population seems to have increased considerably
But late night traffic jams are part of our identity, didn't you heard our glorious president
Glad to see individuals breaking such an awful and barbaric tradition
As we say in spain: Disfruten lo votado (enjoy what you voted)
A difference of 3
78% shouldn’t have been accepted for this kind of decision D:
It’s a new decade, things will change
Whatever the consequences, hopefully we can continue to cooperate peacefully
Despite everything, Brexit still makes me sad
I don't fear for the future of the EU and I am somewhat confident that it may actually be a good thing in the long run for those of us who would like to see further integration in some areas
However, at the same time, it feels like a defeat of harmony
I liked this moment of the session, just after the voting:
[ This one has a better quality of images
[  This one has a better quality of sound
Can you elaborate on what will change on 01JAN21
Don't hospitals make patients take off their watches
How the heck could it remain "unnoticed" for such a long time
That's simply inconceivable
They've been short on commodities in all probability

I'm stunned of how easily he gets the car out of the parking space, when it snowed here in Madrid a couple of wheeks ago I tried for 1h and my Saab couldn't get out of the snow, and it was much less than there
Actually it took me wheek to get the car out, when snow almost disappeared
They are a very peculiar nation
I really like it
Great work
However, there are two things that strike me:
\- 101 biology (I read in other comment that you something like that in your university, but it is surprising because I haven't seen that anywhere in Europe, in my experience)
\- 4:20
Don't people in Greece use the 24 h clock for their devices
At least in Spain, almost all digital clocks would say 16:20 by default
420 nice
The appearance of Germany has degenerated considerably
Looks like in Cyprus the guy gathering data was the one that lost his job
Spain is still worse than 2004
But it wasn't exactly good in 2004
The Roman Empire is seen in the 2018 table
Emigrate
Can't have unemployment if there's nobody left in the country
A leftist government
I'd say that having a stable job in Andalusia is easy mode
The life is great if you have an income source
The hard part is getting to that point
I *hope* I'll be able to say the same in a couple of years
In Spain it seems we will have elections again on November 10th
All the parties hate each other and can't form a government
Pero si soy tan americano como la tarta de manzana
If countries were people, Norway would be that early middle age startup millionaire
The US is a fucking joke

My family has got chickens before my parents were even born in our land and we never did this type of stuff and got chickens with far better meat quality, living in their big fenced terrain eating real grain, chickens dont need this bullshit
I see Louis XIV was, indeed, the State

Russians are making movies about their part on the Space race
There's one about Gagarin and other about Leonov
Both very good movies
So Bulgaria is worse than Hungary and Poland but the EU only complains about the latter two because Bulgaria doesn't directly oppose the EU
Spain not being in a problematic position is a travesti, considering we only have 2 big media conglomerates, 3 if we count the government
Not really healthy, is it
Finland is the best in everything
> it's in the EU, so phone roaming and paying in euro
I knew about Reunion and other EU territories "abroad" but there's something about having free roaming in the middle of the Indian Ocean that feels so crazy to me
The EU is a great thing
Spaniards can't even go to a different province
Reactionary anti tankies that complain even when we celebrate that the red army killed nazis
And it doesn't take 2 braincells to understand what an overreaction is
Ever been stung by a mosquito to see your arm inflate
That's people complaining that soviets took out nazi control over some area
They're not the same thing, there's different reasons why they were bad
And reactionary makes sense as an adjective
Is a comparison with Newton laws
One of which is about each force on an object creating a equal one with opposite direction
Years of soviet rule radicalized some people on the opposite way, blinding their perception and destroying their objectivity
If so, this is a terrible plan
It is much more likely that power would end up in Labour's hands, with a very hard left current leadership
Oh I agree, I think Corbyn likes brexit, without the EU he could implement his hard left agenda more easily
In fact that is why I think if such a plan exists, it is absolutely full of hubris
If the goal of a no-deal chaotic brexit is achieved, the most likely outcome is a much less market friendly Britain orchestrated by Corbyn
...NOW ENTERING KINGS ROW
(cue wind instruments)
...while the rest of the world’s oceans encroach inwards, the Dutch gain land
That's not as much as I thought
France is slight BS
Most french (at least outside Paris) stay home with their parents way later than 23
I think a lot has to to do with uni and jobs
The best unis are pretty concentrated in Paris and a lot of students have to move to attend
Also, the vast majority of professional jobs are in Paris
Even in cities like Lyon or Marseille really don’t have professional jobs for recent grads, so moving to Paris is inevitable for some
edit: I know my flair says Spain, but my mother is French and I went to school in France, I’m French
That’s why I said SLIGHT BS
I swear to God most of the times I have to double check the flair to see if a comment refers to either Italy or Spain because everything is so similar lol
That's pretty rare in the US, too
Most kids leave to go to school or go get a job
Honestly, more people would in Europe if they could
Built in the year 112 by the Romans without any kind of mortar or cement, this is the 15 km long still working aqueduct of Segovia, Spain
here is some more info if someone is interested
I see Spain, I upvote
that's a wide angle lens
The restaurant to the right in this pic has some fantastic food
Romans were awesome, they brought a new meaning to "being ahead of their time".
It looks amazing in the snow
And you must have visited in one of the two or three snow days we've had this year
They are held with great engineering to make sure the stones receive the right pressure to stay in place, that is how arches work in symple terms
It is not misleading
There is no gluing material and the only thing that it's keeping the structure in place  is gravity
not misleading, it's all stones on top of stones and that's it
That's the beauty of it
Chewed Bvbblegvm FTFY
True, Isabel the Catholic had to reconstruct some arches to their original form because they had been replaced
Ofc, the water would fall otherwise, but the structure doesn't have it
At the right of the screen under the subscriber count
Wikipedia says otherwise
>The aqueduct is built of unmortared, brick-like granite blocks
No problem my man, it is actually a really cool site to find information if you ever get tired of Yahoo answers
/r/wholesomesarcasm
did you eat baby pig
I have no idea, I've only been here this year
It's so worth the chill
The arches at the top yeah, look for videos in youtube about arches being build so you understand
It is taken care of but there aren't many earthquakes in the area
What did actually deteriorate it was the traffic of cars next to it and the vibrations of concerts
There are no earthquakes in this area of Spain and it's not terribly windy
Maybe the picture misrepresents the huge size of those blocks
You should visit if you get the chance
there are many restaurants like that one in Segovia and they all make the best pork you'll ever eat
So tender you can cut it with a plate
edit: damn now I want some
Ah haha yeah I didn't understand your question, the top part is obviously with some kind of mortar because the water flows through there so if it were just rocks the water would fall through the holes
yeah
Also some judiones before the pig to make sure you won't get up from the seat until 6pm like a good Spaniard
The gaps between the rocks are very big because they are not perfect, plus the rivers have mud and sand covering the gaps
You can make a religion out of this
Do we keep Majorca then
It's over France we have the high ground now
All Spaniards emigrate to a place with a better economy, all British can retire in the sunny south (and walk to Gibraltar) and all Germans can have their Lebensraum at last
Everyone's happy, aren't they
Edit: also, I'm loving the game Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino are playing
France and Spain don't have a better relationship
And Belgian
You're allowed in, though
It seems there's a quota then

Extremadura sweetie we love you no matter what
Calais and Picardy are in transition from shit to kind of shit
Living in the less developed region of Spain all I can say is that I would like to see some industry being made here, ecologists have blocked many saying that they are harmful and will destroy the ecosystem but I think that we should have an ecolibrium between industry and nature, except a few cities extremadura is just countryside

A jamón based economy is delicious though not very productive
There are few outside Europe
The origin of Europe is Italy
Roman towns does not mean Roman founded towns
Some of them probably existed already
It wasn't founded by Rome
But I am surprised that Rome didn't found any city in Anatolia
I don't trust this map
Isn't it supposed to be this one in the map
:  (OP probably eyeballed it)
In any case, either that, or they didn't include it because it was founded by the Roman Republic not the Roman Empire
It's like Spain, a civilized country

What's sadder is that the number of new corona confirmations is increasing again
Yesterday, new confirmed to be 580
It's a really evil virus
Here in Madrid they put a monument for the deceased over a month ago
It seems they are totally trying to give the message that the worst part is finished (IMHO, because summer and tourism), but the numbers of new cases are just increasing
This is going to be a funny summer
29k is the official number, but compared to last year, there have been 40k more deaths, so it's very likely that the real number is closer to that
Can you point out when they have supported fascism or you simply call fascist to anyone you don't like
Cringe
>Racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism
You can't prove any of that
You have been told that and you are repeating it
They are fascists, they must be those things too
Ok, so you have nothing to answer
A true fascist would never deny being fascist
Pro tip: next time anyone is in Alicante go to [Cervecería Sento] and order the Ivan and some piruletas and chupachups

This is like the seaside walkway, not a huge investment considering its a single line along the main beach
Its also colour altered a bit, the blue is not so strong otherwise in stones like these
Spaniards: oh yeah, I hate Spaniards as well
But I hate foreign invaders more
No worries I found it funny
Bien, pero me estás hablando en español por lo tanto gano yo
I meant in a historical way
Although Romans got us
Took them a while tho, and they didn't really get Basques, nobody did
Cádiz, the canary Islands, and all the colonies remained independent afaik
How about reducing taxes so tax heavens are not necessary
*EU* Army
the comments are full of mental gymnastics jesus christ
Never forget that European lands are still occupied by Turkey and that Europeans died protecting those lands
And don't bother saying that Cyprus isn't geographically European
What are you talking about
Turkey invaded Cyprus 50 years ago
It is culturally
It is in the European Union, after all
And in the US people forgot about masks and distances the moment Floyd was killed because somehow the virus doesn't affect you if you are fighting racism
Europe should prevent a recurrence and prepare thoroughly so that it does not become like the United States
Until the vaccine comes out
Europe is right and America is wrong
Oh, is that a satirical media
We have a very good one in Spain called El Mundo Today
Here when we see ridiculous news in a serious media, we say it looks it was taken from El Mundo Today
This happens more frequently than it should :(
>and they have even two MEPs in the European Parliament (don’t ask why)
I dare to ask why
Can't see the eiffel tower, Holywood tought us that from every window in paris, you can see the eiffel tower, so this must be fake
Here in Spain our current president (Pedro Sánchez, left, socialist party) tried to pull the same stunt two elections ago, if I remember correctly he wanted only one debate on public TV and actually canceled his presence in the private TV
Obviously he got called out from all parties on each side and went to the debate in the end
Three elections ago the then president (Mariano Rajoy, right, Popular Party) accepted debating only with Pedro Sánchez on public TV and refused the one with the rest of the parties on private TV
The difference being Mr Rajoy has literally no shame and couldn't be forced to go, he had the nerve to send his second instead
One day we got 12 new residents from Georgia at our student residence in Germany

i hope everyone is ok
With no offense to our Armenian friends, but when I see kids with flags I see the same when I see kids with religious beads and it doesn't make sense to me
Kids need to learn we live in a planet first before learning how we politically organize it

I don't see any difference

Not even disappointed
There is a spanish dude next to the border sign and he moves it 1cm every night while you guys are not looking

Yes
Not fair either, most of people already think Jamon Iberico is spanish
How about a team dancematch and we bet some random island
Hmmmmm
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
We really did put the turbo in Spain regarding LGBT rights, I don't think there are many other countries in the world that had such an amount of legal and social change in such short time
We were the third country in the world to legalize gay marriage and homosexuality was still illegal down here not even 30 years before that
This isn't legalization of homosexual relationships, this is legalization of homosexuality in general
Basically, whether they'll put you in jail (or worse) just for being gay or not
I was thinking of Ireland too when I wrote my comment yeah, there's definitely some resemblance
Yet considering that we were coming out of a 40 year long fascist dictatorship I think we stepped on the gas harder (not that is a competition of course)
FORZA ITALIA
100% latin culture polician

Lying politicians
She looks as miserable as always
And the matching hats
She's been running the country successfully for 12 (?) years now and Germany is now one of the wealthiest
She shouldn't be miserable
It would be a pinnacle of European History
Holy fuck lol
We're trying to get into nordic
We are hot-blooded Mediterraneans
I think you misunderstood what we mean with "get into nordic"...
But we already have half of the Nordic population living here
How dare you, Eesti is a lady
And hot, too, no one would refuse
Oh man I drove that downhill at night with cars coming the other way
not really recommended
The walls are very European
Spain is a truly dynamic country
What's up with the misleading titles in all this posts mate
It usually snows every year in Madrid, but it doesn't really settle down and just turn into ice
The special thing about this event is the ridiculous amount of snow
Today snowed in Madrid for the first time in 70 months you mean
We have snow once every two years or so but it does not stick to the ground
The last time the airport was closed due to the snow was in 2009
I wouldn't say 70 year but it is the biggest in snow modern Madrid's  recorded history
Snows sometimes , but rarely takes hold and remain on ground, except on the nearby sierra
Also, people have ski equipment because there is a ski station an hour away from Madrid city
I was in Warszawa when it happened
I remember I was amazed to see snowflakes as big as oranges that settled super fast, it didn't last long tho :(
Well you are lucky cause in de city of Madrid it hasnt snowed like this probably since 1904
fun fact, I grew up near Madrid, in the mountains, and I remember there were some "special holiday" every year, variable in dates and duration
due to the snow
It used to plow about 10cm once a year
Years like this, were a real nightmare, I remember my father defreezing the garden's door with the blowtorch, completely locked with ice
And somehow we will have -13 degrees after the snow storm
Does it ever snow, snow in Madrid
It can be at the Pirinees, even at Sierra Nevada
There, it can even snow, snow
snow
but in Madrid
It snows on average 3 days per year in Madrid
It isn't that the title isn't clear, it's plain wrong
Duh, they pretending to be germans here
It's just that normally when moisture comes, it's with warmer air
The cold is typically very dry
The temperatures are pretty normal for winter
As a former young person, I still have memories of waiting for that yearly snowfall we'd get in the late 60s early 70s. Not every year, but it wasn't unusual to see snow on the ground for a day or so
I also recall my dad telling me that it was nothing compared to his youth
which brings me back to your point:
[A nostalgic voyage to Madrid’s winter wonderland]
The mountains in Madrid have two ski stations that have reliable snow every winter
Snow in the city that sticks is rare, especially like this, but it at least snows a bit each year, generally
I've been big into a lot of pre WWII and WWII history lately and I think the fact that Croatian Free State has never really been reckoned with was a major part of the Yugoslav wars
I can kind of get Serbians being very threatened by the checkerboard crest
Not that any of the reaction were in anyway acceptable either
Tudman needed the nationalism for Independence so really went out of his way to ignore the past
>  unfetter capitalism can work to some degree
If you need to qualify it "to some degree" that is not unfettered
We had a taste of that during the Industrial Revolution which ended up with children working in factories
Laws limited that
We can all see how well capitalism works in regards to health care in the US
No, thanks
Companies such as Glove have lowered the pay of their "associates" (I don't know which bullshit term they use instead of workers in English) even though they are working now more than ever
Including unwittingly taking drugs from one home to another
AirBnB has destroyed neighbourhoods and has raised rent prices so that workers can no longer live where they used to
All to host drunk idiots who don't allow any rest to the neighbours who live and work there
No, thanks
Keep your unfettered capitalism
wtf
Are your corneas OK
Reminds me of the galician stereotype
Actually, that's not capitalism, it's crony capitalism
There's no free market if few companies dominate the market with government compliance and intervention

What's up with Hungary and Czechia
Latinos are just people whose mother language is a romance one (Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese
That's in America, in the rest of the world is what I said
"El término latino (adjetivo; del latín latinus, "aquél o aquello que es natural del pueblo que hablaba latín") tiene diversas acepciones y suele prestarse a confusión."
Use Google translate
ctrl+f latino
You'll find the word everywhere, also in French, Italian, Portuguese wikipedia articles about latin
latino = related to latin (Roman Empire language)
America latina is just the part of America where "latin" (romance languages) is spoken
You could call latinos to the Canadians who speak in French are you won't be wrong
> in their own language is a different case, but you reffered to them as latin
It's the same in english
>Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the western Hemisphere where Romance languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French are predominantly spoken
"Latino" is not a race or a culture it just adjetive that tells what language you do speak as mother language
Idk what to say, I've seen a lot of articles talking about Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Paz Vega
and saying they are latinos and they have nothing to do with Latin America (Spain is in Europe, it borders with France and Portugal) So, is Luc Benson latino too
he is from France after all, or how this works, because is not clear at all (at least in America)
Example:
> personally
That's the problem, I don't know your own and personal definition of the world
The uprising happened too early
Heavy nazi reinforcements came by the time soviets were near the river, stopping soviet advances and crushing the uprising
Read up the dates on which stuff happened, soviets weren't keen on their enemy encroaching on a large city just to annoy poles
The Warsaw gueto was much braver, which is why it's better known
1943, soviets aren't anywhere near and done guys fight to death because the alternative is being exterminated
1944, soviets on your doorstep before being kicked out by germans, so they rebel to gain independence
Soviet spearhead had to retreat from near Warsaw due to an armored counterattack

Literally quoting fascist propaganda to own the soviets, wtf
I read the whole article before you posted parts of it
Military plans had other intentions, not taking Warsaw, so when the army approaching Warsaw was pushed back there weren't reserves to conduct another offensive to enter and clear Warsaw
Nothing crazy about it
Military archives seem to give enough information of location of soviet units to see this
I support holding another referendum in Scotland after Brexit, but keep in mind that if you become independent, it must be legally or Spain will never recognise it and you will never join the EU
Well, not the current Spanish government, future governments may accept them even if they declare their independence out of the British law if the British, for any reason, don't let them hold a referendum
That won't happen, most parties agree on that
Too many things must change for that to happen
That's why Spain has never recognised Kosovo, and it never will
No, most Spanish parties share that position
It doesn't seem like it right now, but it's not impossible
There are political parties with millions of votes that would support that as they support the right to hold a referendum also in Catalunya
They will need to grow much more in order to form a government without any of the other parties, but who knows what the future holds
Things change, hell things have changed a lot in the last 5 years, who knows if they can change more in the future
I cannot predict the future (neither can you) but it's certain that the possibility exists
As there are millions of voters in Spain that think like that, in the future we may be some millions more, or not
But that movement exist and it's pretty big to just ignore or say that it will be "impossible".
America was completely knocked down
The death increase is stronger in Brazil
It's the US, they attempt to be number 1 at everything
Good to know
I think here the confirmed cases hitted the plateau around a week or two earlier than the deceases plateau so probably you still need more testing capacity or just have a huge backlog, but moving in the right direction

German cars go brrrrrrrr
TIL some places have different speed limits for the same roads depending on the time of the day
Sounds crazy to me
Is it for encouraging people to avoid travelling during rush hours
Speed limit should be 150, with modern cars you barely notice it
That was 9 years ago and only lasted for like 4 months lol
Nah, I don't think so

Don't you ever do that

You are really fucked at general knowledge man
What
I think you are doing it wrong
Just put the corn with some oil in a pan and cover it
bang bang
fium fium
aghhrrr
Well, you have to recognize that for all the rest of us know about Hungarian, it _could_ be
It tastes too bitter for me
Maybe my corn-per-oil ratio was wrong
Just put enough oil to cover the base of the pan but not too much so that the corn is submerged
Köszönjük, hogy tanított minket
Yeah, you can do it if you're careful so long as it's not virgin/extra virgin olive oil
But really, sunflower seed oil is better
Will do
Thanks
Well, dude didn't say "in Hungarian it's spelled Szizlák", rather "it could pass for one of our words". Trump could not have come from a misspelling of Trumpo, because Trumpo _could pass for_ a Spanish name, but isn't.

> To prove that we can do things better if we want
I mean, I want to do things better
Hell, the whole continent is joining mainly to do things better than in the past
What does that have to do with being one country or two different countries
Maybe is because we don't really want them in Spain anymore, they just try to steal from other regions and don't contribute
That's fucked up
Yeah I agree with that
But /u/Erratic85's point is the opposite, that independence would enable it
Why would we Canarians be bundled with any of you Godos

As a Spaniard I wonder what it is to live in a house where you don't hear your neighbors go to the bathroom
I suppose the good point is that I'm 15 minutes walking to my workplace
I'm from Spain and I totally agree with this
Madrid and Barcelona are full of flats
Oh no
anyways, this does not surprise me
Cities and neighborhoods in Spain were planned from a underdeveloped and rural evironment, villages were abandoned and cities grew fast
Also, suburbs are almost non-existent
The big towns near big cities evolved in cheaper neighborhoods for this cities (called bedroom neighborhoods, for a reason), they removed the old fashioned housing and built flat blocks on the towns
I don't know if this was like that in other countries, but mainly all cities are based in flats and most of the people lives in the cities
You gotta fix all your stuff by yourself
It sucks ass
Of course, I also live in the E.E.U.U. for now but when I lived in Deutschland, housing wasn’t too different from a flat since you’ve got a yard and a dedicated garage if it’s pricey enough, but otherwise it’s just a glorified flat
Living in a flat is certainly easier and cheaper than living in a home where you can spend upwards of 1% of your purchase price in maintaining the property per year alone
Sounds great until you're waken up at 6am by your neighbour's dog/heels/TV/blender/music/speaking/door

I love being able to walk everywhere
I've lived in a house and you needed a car for the littlest thing
Very annoying
But
neighbours
noises
Or at least is what I hope
I'm so sick of my neighbours
Not that I have the money to move out but it fills my dreams
They’re still there and they get into arguments over your dog or that you’re mowing (or not mowing) their lawn
And if you have windows facing them, you gotta keep them covered so they don’t look into your home like creeps
Jajajajaja
Houses are useful for kids, not for a couple or maybe someone with a baby

article 155 and some people in jail
Just like that we have arrived at the greatest attack to spanish democracy since 23-F. It is all kinds of abhorrent that a group that represents 48% of the Catalan people has sentenced both Catalonia and the rest of Spain to a period of social and economical turmoil
This farce created to hide the financial incompetence of the Catalan nationalist parties has reached critical mass and stomped the dignity of all of us Spaniards
What has happened today in Catalonia proves that the true fascists were the ones that shielded themselves with their citizens while nonchalantly breaking not only the Spanish Law but also their own laws
Referendums with rules changed 45 minutes before and without any control, laws approved at 2AM with no opposition to fight them and a parliament closed to all needs of the catalan people except for the one that has been rammed inside the heads of everyone
Independence
What now has to be done is what any other democracy in the world would do, make sure that the rule of law still protects the rights of all citizens regardless of their ideology and care for the safety of the people of Catalonia both unionists and independentists (the current government of Catalonia cared for the safety of neither)
Let's all hope this political tragicomedy does not become a full catalan tragedy
Say good bye to the business and factories of Catalonia
The death of catalan nationalism
What the fuck mate
Just
What the fuck
What do they think it's going to happen now
I'm stuck between bursting out laughing and feeling incredibly offended by their stupidity
At least in a few years I can say I witnessed this
Spanish government: *quicksaving*
> Have the Catalonian secessionists explained how they plan to remain in EU but at the same time be independent
Their point of view was that Europe would be delighted to have them since they are the only worthwhile region of Spain anyway
OMFG THE IBEX IS DROPING LIKE CRAZY, PERFECT IDIOTS
No, because the results of that referendum were the same of a previous one that was declared ilegal but not prohibited
Non independentists refused to take part of the votation
This
The catalan govt never had the authority to declare this anyway
Not OP but yes, it's happened
People around me are disgusted with the coup
Nah, just the police, and they will do their job
Checkmate separatists
That seems to be a running theme with these guys
If they thought that we were stealing their moneys, this is gonna be a whole new level of stealing that the best pirates are gonna be jealous
IIRC, there were 10 abstentions, 2 no votes (in order to give legal cover when Spanish prosecution happens) and the rest had abandoned the parlament
*remembers the procedure of everytime Catalonia tried
Fuck we are in the 21st century
Can't do that
I remember the former President of the Catalan Government saying companies would be fighting each other to be in Catalonia
How many companies have already left
I think it was around 700
Its what a superiority complex does to reality perception
Its not impossible, but you need a majority of Spain's political forces to agree and reform the Constitution to allow it
Hard to achieve
Yes, but not impossible
Thats a point of view I cant share
Catalonya's rulers tried to blackmail the central government for more privileges in a critical economical period, the government said no and the own internal political crisis of traditional catalan rulers made them push for independence as a scapegoat
PP is to blame for being a bunch of corrupts and incompetents, but this mess
This was all on Catalonya
Not true
Exactly

What highways
Last time I've been in Romania that was anecdotal, 90% of roads were only one lane in each direction
And more frightening than Italy, which I thought it was impossible
We are fucked then, China is allowed to lay road and railroads from beijing to cadiz
Spain, the Land of Art
I hope this spread across Europe
Now the question is if this loot boxes make more than 1

They would take a 0

I have to say that as spanish speaker, that applies to us

i really love these types of floats
we have a similar tradition called "fallas" in valencia
Trump is not the only one buttfucking Americans
They are not even the same
You kinda were looking for it
I like the fallas, but going around to unrelated topics to diminish other traditions is calling for attention
I think it would be good to have an international agreement so that everyone had to pay if they polluted too much
There should be a limit of tons of CO2 per country depending on population, gdp, level of development
And then if a country crosses the line they would have to pay to others that are far from the line for their "unused" tons of CO2, this would benefit advanced countries that are comited to the planet as well as poor ones in Africa who can't even pollute because of underdervelopment
"Possibility to set Legaly binding goals" means they fucking made a RECOMMENDATION already, meaning it's not mandatory and there won't be really a punishment if you don't meet the criteria, but they will make all the technical documents for free and open for EU monetary help implementing the measures

I just checked the Eurostat and Spain for example has gone from 9
78 to 7
54 since the year 2000
Comparing only reduction is kinda misleading because ofc Germany is reducing because it was so high to begin with, and right now they are still at 11
41 tons per capita and the UK at 8
Like any other piece of binding legislation in the EU
The EU has approved it, just like the title states
Each country place their own limit and only it can enforce it, as the agreement has absolutely no way to do it
Why is it so misleading
I could not find anything in the article
That was clutch
As long as it is just one relevant country, the rest can just tax it
The problem is if a few major countries don't agree
Some countries don't have a choice, they either pollute or die
It's like a cheat code in Civilization 5
Sick

To be fair I love this community so much that would be horrible to leave it
Some day I just wonder how lucky I am to have been born and raised as a member of the EU and not in the
Well I don't know, the USA
AFAIK: The only people wanting to leave are nationalists who got mad the EU didnt jail the escaped catalan independentists
100% stay
Because we could use our own currency, make our products cheaper (devaluating our currency against the euro), selling more, that would lead to hiring more people in order to be able to produce everything needed, therefore we wouldn't have 25% unemployment rate
Just to name one
European Union is not a problem, the euro currency without further integration is
And the billionaire deal that they have signed is a simple patch, we'll be in the same spot in a few years
This won't be solved unless we create at least 2 currencies, one for the south, one for the north, or we get political and fiscal union, or we just get out of the euro
There is a small percentage of the population who thinks that if we had our own coin we wouldnt have suffered that much on the 2008 crisis
since we could have devaluated our coin to stay competitive or something like that
but thank god that the people who thinks like that (those morons) are a small percentage of the population
Knowing how stupid our politicians are now, they would hit the "print button" on the money printer to increase the public expenses until we become Argentina or even worse in terms of inflation
Communists ruling would just start printing  "Pesetas" and bankrupt the economy
That is what they stated a lot of times
I would be shocked if there were many of us at all
I mean we dumb, but we not brexit dumb
Euroskeptics here are the far-left, now in power through a coalition, who among other things want a fully independent Spanish central bank to print as much money as they want
They see the EU as an capitalist, pro-austerity, anti-debt (lmfao) regime that wants to impose some kind of late stage capitalism on Spain
Spalida ain't happening neither
Espxit
This
(Sorry, the video is in Spanish)
Spain has had problems with the austerity policies but we identify as europeans and want to be with our fellow europeans
It's not only economic
It's actually way more than that
>they get billions of euros from us
ahhh the irony
Don't give us ideas
Paella chart
Is it though
2018 figures for Spain:
* Total EU spend in Spain – € 12
270 billion(equivalent to 1
02 % of the Spanish economy)
* Total contribution to EU budget – € 10
314 billion(equivalent to 0
85 % of the Spanish economy)
We paid 0
85% of our GDP and recieved 1
02% of our GDP, so we are left with 0
17% of our GDP, that is thanks to the EU, 1 out of every 588
2€ spent in Spain is coming from the EU, do you think that's a big deal for Spain
Is that a "massive amount of money"?
Really Spain pays almost as much as is given by the EU
I'll most likely stay and I think it will surpass the US eventually
To be fair, I'm pretty sure even Zimbabwe is going to surpass the US if they keep doing things like they are doing rn
Yes, but the things we import are not more important than having food, a roof, and a job to go to
Having Iphones, electronic and Audis are not more important than having 25% unemployment rate
It's sad to have to choose, but it's sadder to collapse and be forced to choose under even worse conditions
I don't know what's sadder, that the EU keeping us in line will make us miserable (permanent high debt, high unemployment) or that you're right and our politicians would probably not do the right thing if we gave them the chance and we would end up in a worse situation
It's impossible to know how it would all end up
Plus another problem would be that this needs a long term plan, maybe 10 years, and the first years would be very hard, so people would probably vote the party that promises to "solve it all with another plan that magically makes us all happy", breaking the original plan in pieces, and ending up in a worse situation
So I guess the best way to get through this is just to pray and believe that the European Union will do the best for us
At this point how do we say that to our northern "brothers"? Further integration today means they'd have to pay taxes that would partially go to the south
In Spain (and I'm sure it happens everywhere) Madrid, Catalonia and Balearic Islands (richer regions) pay taxes that go to Andalusia and Extremadura (poorer regions), but we're "used" to it, we were born within this system
But Europe is not a country, how do we start doing the same every country is doing without any of the parts feeling betrayed
I love when ppl use the "yeet" word ahahahHAHAH
I am quite sure we have started civil wars on lesser provocations
Bueno, es un vídeo con tono de humor
Está claro que hay veces que son útiles, pero es cierto que muchas veces se abusa de ellas
In other words, you want to become another Argentina
>In Spain (and I'm sure it happens everywhere) Madrid, Catalonia and Balearic Islands (richer regions) pay taxes that go to Andalusia and Extremadura (poorer regions), but we're "used" to it, we were born within this system
But Europe is not a country, how do we start doing the same every country is doing without any of the parts feeling betrayed
You can't. You need a feeling of in-group solidarity, so that people from the north feel like we, in the south, are part of the same team
I am not bashing the north at all, but that feeling just isn't there
Hell, a big part of the population within Catalonia doesn't have that feeling towards Andalusia, Extremadura, etc
To them, our taxes going to Andalusia means our taxes going "to someone else who is not us".
It just isn't possible for many of the "richer" countries in the north to support the south again and again happily
And make no mistake: there is always wealth inequality between regions, so this wouldn't be "temporary". The feeling of belonging to the same group has to endure for as long as the fiscal union lasts
I find that very hard to happen in Europe
Each one has its uses
Here we have parts of a whole, this is, the total is always the same and one incresing means other decreasing, so best charts are stacked bars or pie
The chart used in OP can be confusing because one could think that No can increase without Yes decreasing, because that's how bar charts are usually used
Not necessarily outside the European Union but outside the euro zone
Look at Poland or Czech Republic, you're doing just fine because you didn't fall in the trap
No, Spain is not near the situation of Argentina, we'd become another Argentina if we wait to do this 10-15 years
If you want your life to be miserable, then become political active in Spain xD
I mean, most people here vote their party as if it was a football team, always and forever loyal to the same club and in most cases inherited from your parents
Have you heard of the Two Spains, in endless conflict
Some may thing that is a conservative vs
progressive fight, but the real truth is that the unsolvable divide is those who eat their tortilla without onions and those filthy savages that add onions
So you are saying that in the next 10-15 years, if we don't do what Argentina has been doing for decades then Spain will become another Argentina
Doesn't make any sense
You are even willing to pay much more for technology like argentinians do (not just mobiles, everything involving technology), I don't think everyone agrees with you
How about copying what prosperous countries do instead
Reforms, a labor market adapted to the economy and not the other way around, a sustainable deficit, ... Countries that constanltly resort to currency devaluation to fix their deficit are all them in an endless crisis, that's not a model to follow
Let's take as inspirations populations that a few decades ago were vey poor and are now prosperous because the government focused on business development instead of populism
Let's be humble instead of looking for magical macroeconomic formulas that never worked
Sure
That was exactly my point
This happens everywhere within countries
Now, my other point, was that the disconnect between EU regions (north vs south) is way bigger than the disconnect between country regions (e.g.: Catalonia-Rest of Spain, or as you say, within Germany)
We may disagree here, but I don't think people from say, the Netherlands, will be happy with a fiscal union where there is constant (and bigger than now) wealth transfer between the north of the EU and the south
The thing is prosperous countries didn't start their journey with a 20% unemployment rate and a debt of 100% of their GDP
If you point out a country that started with those numbers and ended up as a prosperous country I'd love to follow their lead
Then don't hinder businesses development and employment with so much estate intervention in the labour market and client politics
It doesn't matter if you start with 20%, 10% or 5% unemployment
I give you an extreme case, post-war west Germany, they grew very fast with a strong currency
I don't know, I am no fortune teller
But I don't think a fiscal union is possible in the medium term given the current environment
And millions flowing with the Marshall plan, you forgot to mention
And what's your point
Spain will receive tones of subsidies after the recent agreement, plus all the cohesion funds in the 90s. But you rather leave the EU to devalue a local currency, punish savers, scare investors and become another Argentina
This was made by someone from Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia
I will lead a Confederation of Breweries Provinces
I hope we can count on some support from Central Europe

Checkmate
From a cultural point of view one is French while the other is basque
These maps always come across as arbitrary anyway
A British show could be filmed in northern Spain because its looks different than southern and central Spain in terms of environment and weather
That's clearly the case, like North Korea
New Zealand
The UK is a world power
It has a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, nuclear capabilities, is a member of the G8, home to the financial capital of the world, is a diplomatic top player, and a cultural powerhouse
London's GDP alone is almost five times bigger than New Zealand's.
We are on the way too
End the coronavirus quickly
The US wont turn that corner until they recognize all comparable countries (China, Spain, and Italy) had to take far more extreme confinement measures to begin to turn a corner
The US has piecemeal measures that differ across states and cities
Even where the confinement is serious it's nowhere near as serious as in Spain and Italy
We’ll see how long that lasts
Apparently a single request post can include several delete requests
As much as we banter each other, in times like this I feel European over all things, stay strong we are together in this shit, they won't destroy the europe we want to build
It’s a French problem, not a European one

"Europa limita al norte con el populismo,
al sur con los refugiados ahogados en el mar
Al este con los tanques de Putin,
al oeste con el muro de Trump".
It's a poem
Different parliamentary groups and lots of people give lots of very passionate speeches about things all day long
Though this one is about a cause Verhofstadt agrees with to his core
Someone has to say it for it to happen
Believe it or not, and I am not, but you can be right-wing plus very europeist
Those are not exclusive
Same reason why there are very pro-independence people and some of those still are be very europeist
I agree but I don't mind upvoting even if he's an hypocrite just because I don't care who is the one saying it: the truth is truth and all what he said is something you can agree with just like I agree with you now
Just my opinion, and probably a wrong statement, but I think most of us don't really like our country, and feeling more 'included' in Europe makes us feel kind of better
It's just a bad translation
He actually meant it was totally unselfish
They are actually pretty reasonable in Brussels/Strasbourg
They don't have an network of old friends to funnel money too there and there isn't much in the way of directly awarding contracts
Worth remembering that the most anti-EU major party in Spain is Podemos, and they're still very much pro-EU
I'm not sure if we don't like our country or we just like to point everything that is wrong so we can make it better
I mean, we talk very badly about Spain, but then a foreign person do it and we are ready to rise the Cruz de Borgoña.
I'd say we point everything that is wrong just because
Well, also because Iglesias' self-interest is to make it look as if the only parties in Spain are PP and Podemos
It's snowing right now in Barcelona, wtf
Not enough for it to settle of course, but still
It is snowing in Madrid again, but it is melting when it reaches the ground :(
Car didn't start this morning
Battery died because of the cold
The one night we had to leave it outside
we were late for work
Also it's snowing in my town
When it snows in my town, it's an apocalypse in the rest of europe
I didn't expect the balkans  to be so cold

Where is this located in the city
There's a few buildings like this in London - not sure if the rail track/bridge is older than the building, but I find them ugly as hell
!WishToKnowMore
It's a lot more futuristic than Madrid
Gotta spend those monarch points
Nothing personally against the Spanish royals, but I'd prefer a Republic with a President similar to Portugal's. The monarchy can only provide powerless masters of ceremonies
Might as well have an elected head of state with actual power
One is not like the others
On top of that: Norway's look like the cool manager at the office
Sweden's looks like the boss that seems tough at first but then is quite sensible
Denmark's is an actor playing the role of a prince
Parasites, all of them
In Spain, Monaco and Liechtenstein the males still get preference, we had debates about this and they even tried to change it but it was somewhat hard to do (i don't know why) so they just ignored the problem to this day, the King already said he's not gonna make more babies so Leonor will probably be the next Queen
EDIT: The law says that a boy can replace a girl if this girl was not the Princess of Asturias yet, but Leonor is already the princess, so no one can replace her
The US is kind of a monarchal-looking democracy
Things like the political dinasties or the role of _First lady_ which is completely non existent in other countries (I have no idea who ours is or her name) are very reminiscent
> (i don't know why)
Because it needs a constitutional change, and in Spain you will have an easier time getting the politicians to lower their salaries and publicly reveal all their income than to have them agree that the constitution must be changed *and* agree in the details of the change
If Infanta Sofia had been born a boy they probably would have bitten the bullet and changed it, but since she cooperated everybody could breathe again and push the problem onto the next generation, as is Spanish tradition
Reforming the preliminary title, first title, the second title, and the last title, are the elements that require massive consensus:
-2/3 of the Chamber
-2/3 of the Senate
-Elections
-Ratification by 2/3 of the new Chamber
-Ratification by 2/3 of the new Senate
-Ratification by referendum
Any of those fails, and the reform is over
> there's no real power attached
I know, but she's kind of a big deal and has a public and relevant profile, exactly like the queen/king spouse
In Spain no one knows who the First Lady is, she's irrelevant to the public
> For example the spouse of the German President does the exact same things the American First Lady does
I missed a "many" before that "other countries". Anyway, I have absolutely no idea so correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the role of the German President the same as our king
Kind of representative or so
In the US there isn't that split between PM and President so I was thinking more about spouses of PMs, like the one who gets things done
For the rest of the articles on the Constitution, it would require a 3/5 majority in the Chamber, and ratification by a 3/5 majority in the Senate
However, you are right
That was fast
Oh,poor France
I am triggered just looking at it, I don't even want to think what they are feeling right now,
I'll make sure tell a Russian v.1
Wait, why would the term "latino" annoy spaniards
The term is often used to refer to those who speak Spanish so there is nothing wrong with it
100% garantee nobody in Spain will give a fuck
I don't get irritated when called Latino, south Americans are *Hispanics*, Spanish and Italians are latiniums
Would calling Finland Scandinavian count
I feel like we're the only ones that don't offend anyone by speaking Spanish in Portugal because it's very, very clear that we know they aren't the same thing, but you DO understand us
It is just people who associates latino with Latinamerica, but if I said "la comunidad latina" I would be refering to Latinamerica and Spain
Ahh
so the true trick to making things awkward for a Finn is go in for the kisses on greeting
I mean, I can't really say anything because we just don't understand anything when you guys talk
I feel like an asshole because I just speak at people in Portugal and don't even worry about what people say back because I won't get it anyway
Italian fucks with my brain
I'll get whole sentences and then just won't understand anything in the next sentence
I mean, my go to phrase is
"eu falo portuñol que é falar em español com un accento exagerado" or something like that
I've been around Portugal a fair amount so I kind of get it, but it's still hard and I got just about zero the first time
Also, just doing Portuguese Duolingo for like a month is enough to deal with Portuguese just fine for a Spanish speaker
It could also include them, in fact, "los pueblos latinos" in something common in History books
Yeah, but if you guys learn Spanish, you basically get Catalan thrown in for free

Well the overall situation here is not very different than what we've seen in Italy
Overall people do respect the distance when queuing in the supermarket and they allow elderly and vulnerable people to go in first
Many many young people have volunteer in their neighborhoods to go buy the stuff of the elderly that live alone or have no one to take the basic stuff for them etc
I'm in Madrid, which is the most affected region by far, although other regions such Catalonia or Basque Country are following close, especially considering per capita statistics in the second case

I'm ok with it I live with my partner and we do OK but Spanish people overall are very "street persons" and we cannot afford to stop the economy for much longer
Edit: Also, I just read that Fuengirola mayor activated a plan for over 70 y.o. that live alone and need help:
*The mayor, Ana Mula, has reported that last Monday she instructed the Department of Social Welfare and Families to draw up a list of people over 70 living alone to contact them all in order to offer them help
"We are asking them if they need food, medicine or to walk their pet, to offer them this help from municipal staff," he said
*To this end, the municipal body has made available to this program two direct phone numbers of the Department of Social Services, 952 58 25 44 and 952 46 07 50, in addition to the three enabled by the City Council itself for public attention during these days of health alert, 952 58 93 00, 952 58 93 01 and 952 58 93 02

Every summer there is news about central and southern Spain being at 40
something degrees
I remember one time when my scottish friend was visiting me (I live in northern Spain) and on tv there was this map showing 45º in Andalucía and how people had to sleep after rubbing ice cubes in their skin and sinking their feet in cold water
After that she stopped complaining about the 25º in my city
Luckily we have "dry 35Cº" which is not as bad as "humid 33Cº"

So proud of being European
As a Spaniard who has seen the rise of unemployment and desindustrialization since the country entered the EU, many of those are debatable
At least I can leave my country to use my skills trained with money paid by the Spanish government to work in Germany and make that country even richier
A complete Godsend
But apart from all of that, what are the rest of Europeans ever done for us
Oh yeah social welfare great

Can I still marry some hawt bulgarian in Spain
pls
Surrogacy is a completely different matter, with its own set of separate ethical problems that are nowhere near as clear cut as the matter of marriage equality is; that as a matter of coincidence happens to affect the "equality" of same-sex marriages in a practical manner
I just wanted to point this out in the midst of this debate, because the subtext of that phrase seems to be that by not outright opening the legal floodgates for surrogacy, such countries are being somewhat "backwards".
Hey
welcome to the club ;)
How do they have time to do that, was it a Thomas Cook flight
Probably a good thing
I'm for nuclear, but it's not renewable
Wood is renewable
What's renewable or not is the source, not the materials used to create the powerplants needed to extract it
Renewable =/= ecologically friendly
>>Wood is renewable
>Yeah and it's so good for the environment
I don't know if you're being sarcastic, but again, renewable doesn't mean pollution free
>>What's renewable or not is the source, not the materials used to create the powerplants needed to extract it
>Huh
You were talking about cobalt and solar and wind
>> You were talking about cobalt and solar and wind
But, no, the materials needed to produce the energy of are clearly resources, and it's stupid to think that they aren't.
You're determined in using a well defined term as a lazy synonym for "eco-friendly". This won't go anywhere

Granada - Spain
I almost forgot to give credit to the author of the photo: Sergio Luque Lopez
He has a Fb page where he post more pics of the city ^^
That mountain behind is Sierra Nevada
It is both the highest peak in mainland Spain, the largest national park and the largest ski station in Spain
It is the most beautiful city in the world
I went to Granada and don't recognise this view at all lol
Is that the Al Hambra in the back
You’re right
Good thing about the city is you have mountain and beach like ~1h apart from each other
Whether it’s a cold day of winter or a hot summer day you can choose where to go to find the weather you prefer
Oh rly
Me too
This pic was made a few days ago with the first snow of the season
Hope this year snow in the city too~
Lol
This summer I went to Porto, first time in Portugal
I fell in love with the city, the country, the food and the people
Sure
it was taken from the courthouse "La Caleta" even though the perspective google maps offers you is not so fair, trust me when I say that's what you see when you stand right in that spot
"Dale limosna, mujer
que no hay en la vida nada

Its called Granada because of the fruit (pomegranate
), not because of the weapon lmao
I live here
Do people actually believe we're a tropical climate or something
Isn't that illegal
Sup medium bro
No, lifts are close and it doesnt seem that they will be able to open
Granada is a very small city, I think 3/4 days are enough to see everything
Definitely you must see the Alhambra and Generalife, Cathedral, Capilla Real, Sacromonte caves, Cartuja and take a walk around the city ^^

Serious answer, it's the loan system
You are guaranteed a loan at a reasonable rate and then once you graduate you only have to pay back after you reach a certain income threshold so it's not an undue burden
The result is that the system is financed by its own success and not by taxing poor people to give the money to rich people (which is what free college is)
Those numbers are going to be large if they are government funded or not so might as well have the people that make the most money from the education pay for it
The super rich understand the importance of cash flow versus total spend and that the rates are pretty good compared to long term investments so it'd be smarter to take the loans even if you had a lump sum
Same reason super reach people take mortgages
Then she has more money out and won't pay them all back before they're written off
That's a good thing
But it's not debt that you have to pay if you don't make money
The system increases access to poor people
That would be cheap to an American shopping for university
> In Denmark where I am from, university is free and you get financial support from the govt
and we have some of the highest upward social mobility in the world
That may be true, but in the case of college education you are taking money from the uneducated and giving it to the educated
If you correlate that to income, that means taking from the poorer people to give to wealthier people
Now, you may like that system and I would imagine most people posting here have benefited from  from it so will probably like it more
But recognize that it's upward redistribution
Would I like for someone else to have paid for my education
Absolutely, I'd think it's great
Then I'd get to keep a lot more money for myself, but the fact is that the education is what made me able to get all the extra money so it's only fair that I pay for it and not make some low income person who didn't benefit pay for it
> So for a short while the university student has his/her education paid for by everyone - including the uneducated - but afterwards they contribute in taxes for the healthcare, childcare, eldercare, unemployment for the uneducated
You could use the same argument to subsidize businesses so they are able to grow to produce more taxes
Somehow I don't think you feel the same way
Let me guess, it was bombed and got renovated
I lived in France for more than 5 years, I'm still using "putain" instead of "joder" even if I left the country 7 years ago, cannot help it, it comes out straight from my soul
I think it's the way the French pronounce it, with such passion and despair even for petty stuff, it's contagious
In Spain I've heard "putas" as a "fuck" alternative
Yeah, porra is both a food and an insult
Carajo also means that in Spanish and it has a fun story
Sailors would be punished by being sent to the *carajo*, the highest mast on the ship, which would make them seasick and feel lonely
Now that you mention it, I have found a lot of coincidences between French and Italian words
Sort of as if they were two divergences from one common root, something akin to relatives within one family
My guess is when the anunnaki created Italy, they sort of based it on the ancestor of France: colder, rainier climate in the North, drier, Mediterranean in the South, a penchant for higher forms of music, overindulge in tragic passions, the dolomites are a bootleg version of the French Alps, the Apennines are clearly based on the Pyrenees, Rome is like a more humble version of Paris, Italian cuisine like a fast food version of French one etc
The language is just another example
And a weapon
I giggled at "For Now". How long has it been there
In Spain we have Guarromán! It's a curious evolution of an arabic word, but in today's Spanish, "guarro" means "disgusting" or "someone who does dirty things". "Man" doesn't mean anything in Spanish, but thanks to Superman, Batman and Spiderman, we now have a town named after the worst superhero of all: [Disgustingman

Just joking
But it is most likely that the style of architecture was brought by the conquistadores at the time
This type of construction (narrow streets with white finishing) is very good for very hot places, such as California
In fact, the location with the highest average amount of precipitation in Spain is in Andalusia (Sierra de Grazalema, Grazalema's mountainous system)
Also the driest region in Spain is also in the south, in the region of Murcia
The biggest ski resort in Spain is also located in the south (Sierra Nevada natural park)
etc
What I mean is that the south of Spain is much more diverse and susceptible to the time of the year than people might expect at first
Without knowing the exact location we cannot know how are the conditions and if these roads are necessary or just a vestige of older times (which is of course a possibility)
Most likely they just didn't put that much thought into it
They built a standard sidewalk x meters wide beside each house and didn't stop to think about the space left in between
Andalucia is your typical videogame world, you have a lot of biomes in a "small" place

That's a decent read on the guy sent, note that most Spanish furies were carried out by his son, but he is the one feared
Also, a link with what historians consider was unfair criticism (not much)
This council judged both those considered rebels and those clerics "expanding the heresy".
>According to historical writer Jonathan Israel, almost nine thousand people, from all levels of society, were convicted of heresy or treason
As most of these were tried in absentia, however, only about 1,000 of these sentences were carried out
The other convicts had to live in exile, their possessions confiscated
This is the list of different sacks and violent sieges by the Spanish troops
Ordered by commanders or by mutineers
>It is important to distinguish the so-called "Spanish Furies" in 1572 from the Spanish Fury at Antwerp in 1576, as these were explicitly ordered by the military commanders, while the sack of Antwerp was perpetrated by mutinous troops
It ain't really shorter

That is surprising, because the EU sets a minimum criterion, not a maximum
Countries are allowed to have stricter rules, but not weaker
In this case, if the NL wanted to have stricter rules about the protection of net neutrality, I would have thought that it wouldn't be in conflict with the EU
Do you know why is like that in this case
Do you have a source

But even with that shit change we are better with Euros in the long run

Those countries people's are ought to think about what they are doing, because if they keep being like that and someday we grow tired of them

Why Spain is divided in many balls but Germany doesn't even have Bavaria
It's great
I doubt they can do that under EU treaties
Supermarkets themselves could
Also, Poland exports plenty to other EU too, they would fight back
The biggest agricultural winner in the EU is France with its subsidies
Farmers in colder/poorer EU areas are often angry that they have to compete against subsidized old Europe
Also true, but the idea of EU is free market for goods through our borders, hence it's normal that cheaper product "wins".
Great work
Just to be obnoxious, Spain's mountains are really weird in your map
Check this out:
The Meseta is a word meaning something like "table" (plateau, to be more specific)
Mountain ranges should be around or across the Meseta, not form the Meseta itself (which should be in the center of the peninsula, not in the northeast)
The northern Cordillera Cantábrica (somehow a continuation of the Pyrenees along the Atlantic coast) should go along the west-northeast Sistema Central and the north-southwest Sistema Ibérico
Then, just end the map with the southwestern almost coastal Sistemas Béticos
I really like your map and think this improvement would make it better
Don't consider it an attack or an underappreciation, please
Where do you think Ikea got all that wood from, uh
Came here to say this
It looks wonderful but the meseta is very wrong
I live there and, trust me, no mountains here
It also places Madrid in a valley surrounded left and right by mountains when that's not the case
The Sistema Central lie north to north-west of Madrid
In /u/metalpotato's map it'd be roughly on the C of Central
It does look amazing but that mistake is very jarring when you know the area

Last Christmas I was in La Seu d' Urgell and they had a beautiful romanic-style nativity in the Cathedral square, and I was so dissapointed that it had no caganet
Luckily then I went to grab the free hot chocolate and saw that he was hidden behind the nativity :D
There’s nothing more ridiculous than religion

The Netherlands is a very mature country mentally
To be frank, I don't think it is hard to imagine it
We also don't know anyone who survived the black death, and that whipped out between a third and half of Europe's entire population
I doubt that WWII will ever be "just another event" in history because of how much it changed the world
It will still be an exam question, so to say
However, as emotional attachment fades, it will be studied just as we study other time periods

I love the Catalan version

Well Berlin's public transport has some _interesting_ ads too, mein lieber deutscher Freund
It was great
I just can't understand why Catalan nationalists have to appear every time someone considers Barcelona/Catalonia as part of Spain to post their "nOt sPaiN buT cAtaLoniA" propaganda
The world doesn't care about your ultranationalist fantasy
I have upvoted this post because I love Catalonia as much as any other part of Spain, I consider every person of Catalonia a citizen of my own country
You can't, and won't, steal Catalonia nor Valencia from the rest of Spaniards, nor from all the Catalans and Valencians who consider themselves Spaniards and who love Spain
Yes, Spain has everything to do with this, because it was created by an administration that is part of the Spanish state
No, it's up to the Spaniards to decide what our nation is, from Galicia to Catalonia and from Andalusia to the Basque Country
The Basque Country is as mine as yours, and so is Catalonia
That's what the Constitution says
Ok, everyone who disagrees with you is a fascist
The reality is that Spanish people have no problem with Catalans
The only ones who have a problem are separatists who hate Spain
Speaking Catalan in the Congress in Madrid
And not being able to do that is cultural imposition
Wake up
Federation
Between Spain and Catalonia
If that's the only way you think we can be together, it's impossible
Catalonia is not equal to Spain, Catalonia is part of Spain

why is a trade deal crazy
the world was progressively becoming more and more connected since ww2, both for prosperity and to keep war at bay - the "trade-offs" of open commerce are as fictional as that all immigrants are blood-sucking rapists
This will make trade perfectly balanced, as all things should be
In that case, objection withdrawn
the whole narrative about "globalism" being evil and sinister is the dumbest load of shit
No need to so far to see way worse waste
In Spain it grew to 25-30 in the past few years afaik
Cool map, but useless
Same in big cities in spain
25-30 for primary school (max 30), 30-36 high school (max 36)
I'm curious
Who else had them
Asterix and Obelix, for people who don't know them
They're from a French comic about the roman times in Gaul (current France)
There's also a few movies that I can't even remember how many times I've watched
Edit: Engrish
Same in Spain, grew with them
I'm pretty sure I still have few comics around my house
I have aaaaaall the Astérix comics
These guys, along with Tintin and Haddock are a big part of my childhood
Do you always have a relevant video or picture for every thread
I love you
Damn, east/nord Europe are you ok
This is kind of iffy, because in Spain suicide rates are not made public, supposedly to avoid encouraging other suicidal people
It's also a great way to hide the problem, but I'm unsure wether that is intentional
Why do men kill themselves more than women
I'm from northern Spain and even I feel a change in my mood when I visit south
It's often an underrated variable I think
If I recall correctly they also have a higher life expectancy
Having a higher rate of depression as an illness probably caused by weather conditions (?) doesn't that the average person who is lucky to not have that illness is more happy than the average person in other places with lower depression rates
What I mean is that maybe we should dissociate depression and just being sad or happy
As depression is an illness that may be caused for different reasons
And depression may lead to suicide more frequently that just being sad
I don't think I've explained myself right, but anyway it's just a supposition, so I will be probably wrong anyway
I’m sorry, we kinda need that, tourism and stuff, I’m sure you guys understand
You’re more than welcome to come see it tho
If men suicide attempts are not reported, how do you know it
They report to you but not to the social services
Idk, your supposition reads like some big stereotype: serious men with real problems vs girls just want some attention
I'm going to need some data to believe that women do more "fake suicide attempts" only for attention and sympathy
I mean, depression is a serious thing for both men an women, I don't see it being so trivial as just wanting attention for any of them
Usually the southern European lower rates are related to sociocultural and climate stuff
The Mediterranean way of life is more relaxed, less mindful of criticism, less stressful and more hedonist than the rest of Europe's
On the other hand, deeply religious communities usually don't acknowledge suicide as such to avoid stigmatisation
It happens less and less and only in rural areas, but it's more common in the south and east of Europe
Don't be malo, they need our sun to vivir
They may also be struggling but I don't think that mentally wise it is fully comparable taking your life in a violent, brutal way like shooting yourself in the mouth (if you destroy your face you really have to hate yourself, or don't have anyone you care of who may see the corpse) than taking a couple of pills and call the ambulance as he says
So maybe he didn't choose the right wording but he has a point
Also some of those women do that several times a year, so I'm not sure if this is the case but their counting can be a bit tricky
So you see 1000 attempts and it is maybe only 800 people, for instance, whether for 1000 "successful" suicides you really know it is 1000
This is the approach for companies that heard about the GDPR 2 yearsago, said "its plenty of time left" and yesterday went like "what do you mean it is tomorrow
Also, supposing your country had some legislation that required you to give consent for, say, double opt in for email verification, companies do not have to send you a email to get your consent again, because consent was given with the previous law, but most companies got that part wrong and sent the mail begging for consent anyway (more power to us, honestly)
Here in Spain the application of the law has been on the disastrous side, moreso for some big comapnies which should know better
Left all the work for the last day and they had to do in a week's time what takes months to certify
There's some of that aswell, but most of the time it is not "malice" just gross incompetence
At the end of the anchor chain is where we keep Greece
Yeah, it should be the american flag
Portugal is in an irreversible state of affairs, which would be even more emotional

In most European countries you can't own an automatic weapon or a handgun
I think most weapons are shotguns and semi-automatic long rifles, all intended for hunting
Also, to own a hunting license and firearms you must pass an exam and a psychological test, and have a perfect police record
So it's not only the number of weapons
Yeah
Spain is shit, but officially we haven't fought more than 5 wars, with half of those not being officially recognised as wars, but as support mission with western allies

Tomato gang arise
I don't think that lime really exists or at least for Spain, here we have lot of recipes with potato (patatas bravas, Spanish tortilla, etc) and same for tomato (gazpacho, salmorejo, etc)
>tomatoes
You got it all wrong
The wall was made to defend us tomatoes from the barbaric traditions of all the potatoes
I mean, what the hell is a potato
Not even pigs eat them uncooked
We had to start growing tomatoes in tremendous amounts just to throw them over the wall and hope the ground would get so slippery that none of you could get any close to it
We in the south live in constant fear
Only a few are brave enough to go there and throw everything we have to protect us all

It is just myself only that feels this castles look nothing like they used due to their restorations, and they look out of place
Neuschwanstein castle was never a castle, defensve or not
It is a fake historicity building from 1869
These decorations were added to defensive castles long after the need for a fortified fortress in that spot, and in this particular case, the actual castle was razed and turned into a ruin in 1617 for rebellion of its owner
It then was one of the many buildings restored by Viollet-le-Duc (the man who restored Notre Dame) in the 19th century

lol wait for them to realize that nordic countries rank among the highest in economic freedoms
Europeans living in America, I do see some of the US point
Europe is actually robs you when it comes to taxes
And a lot of that money goes is just pure bullshit that will be lost in bureaucracy
That being said, having things like universal healthcare is not socialism
And Americans don’t realize that every thing we have in Europe exists in America as well
except ours works well and theirs is routinely underfunded and undermined
I'm surprised Spain is not there
Germany more socialist than Spain
Hold kæft, du svensk svin (/s)
Seriously, DM
People complaining because you reduce two of the most important politicians of your country to a leg competition is "Censored by the left". Did the government prevented you form publishing it, in the name of "the left"?
I am so tired of people needing safe spaces or they cry: "Oh, no, I publish something and people criticize me
Why are they so mean to me
". Grow a spine, you toilet paper
But would that also because the whole EU thing was completely different in the 70's to what it is now
in Spain we lost all pretensions of being an empire after we lost Cuba in 1898
If this looks more like a fantasy castle than an actual castle, that's because it's exactly what it is
It was ordered by Ludwig II of Bavaria, called "The Fairy Tale King". He loved fantasy works, he was more interested in art than in government and he was also gay
Perhaps a man born out of time, but he left us a great legacy, like this castle, or his patronizing of much of Wagner's later work, which perhaps wouldn't have been written without his support

There were manifestations to put her back on the throne after she was kicked out
And not small manifestations, It was an armed confrontation and the manifestants, comuneros was their name if you want to read about it, took the control of cities like Toledo
The history of Spain is like a reality show
Im talking about Juana la Loca (the surname means crazy, It was her nickname because she was legit retarded) daughter of Isabel and Fernando
> Orange fuck
Juana la Loca around 1500, she was the daughter of Isabel and Fernando, for context this was a few years after America was discovered and the next King would start the empire

I forgot that they are actually going to merge with Soundcloud, another Swedish company
I was thinking about the offer they received from iTunes
I haven't said that
I just said that Europe cannot aspire to be "tech independent" if they cannot prevent every single "grass root" to be purchased by foreign entities
We have them over here too and no one with money buys them
They are cheaper alternatives to local cars, maybe better in some regards but not on the level of BMW or Mercedes
Europeans do not buy more German cars than French, Swedish or Romanian
Germany tops the luxury car market, but it isn't by far the most bought cars among the plebs, specially as you move further away from Germany

alienating turkey, shifts the politics or middle east, entirely to Russia’s favor
why do you thinl turkey is part of NATO and not EU
NATO is a response to (now) Russian geopolitical moves, we need Turkey because of its geographical position and its political influence in balkans and middle east
Unfortunately, Turkey knows this and there’s really nothing we can do while maintaining a position over russia
I remember when may was a jk to everyone

It's a pity that Britain, which used to command the world, is now reduced to this
What a bizarre mix Spain has
That age range matches people who were in their twenties in the 2008 crisis and the property bubble
There was insane demand to build more and more, mostly in touristic places
Salaries were as insane even for the simplest worker to funnel people into the building sector to satisfy the demand
Most young people in touristic and/or poor areas left school ASAP to take those jobs
When the bubble exploded and construction of new buildings stopped, they found themselves with no qualification and no job
This map is news to me, but tbh there is this mindset in Spain that if you are not going to college, just get a job and quit wasting your time
I just didn't know it was that spread
Unemployment and low quality jobs (lack of industry is a big factor) . Studying is usually not worth it if you don't plan on immigrating to richer regions as you'll find yourself with 25 or more years with no job experience, no money and if you ever find any kind of job you would make little more than 1000 €.
It is different here bc till 16
Grade it is mandatory so it is like that
Whet we call secondary is up to 18 and are courses that prepare to un or grados medios that don’t let you enter for university but they prepare for specific professions
Sorry for my English
And the north has harder exams
It isn't. You are looking at the numbers of 30-34 year olds: The generation that were on their teens when the construction bubble was at its height
Many of those left school as soon as possible to earn a lot of money in the construction
A glance at the results now explains why when the bubble exploded Spain had such a bad time trying to recover: In the sough we had a literal generation that ended up with no job and no studies
There are a lot of problems in the world that are worse that autocorrect, but few of them are more irritating
Come to  heaven on earth 'Spain', English people

>The prime minister wants to hold talks about a fresh deal but the EU needs to "rethink" its "current refusal" to make any changes to the withdrawal agreement, Downing Street added
Is this the "no u" of high-tier politics
I am so tired that they try to make Europe seem the bad guy
I cannot even understand this
Rethink the current refusal so you can vote it another bazillion times in the British Parliament
UK doesn’t really need Europe
There are countless of other countries the can partner with
UK is militarily and politically very strong with or without the EU
Their status as a permanent member of U.N. Security council, possession of nuclear, and invaluable intelligence will make them big player on the world stage for a long time
The reason there isn’t a good Brexit deal is because deep down all of the UK knows that there is nothing wrong with the EU
Instead of trying to change the way the EU works and working to restructure it so that countries have more autonomy, they just left
The EU has problems but it’s also a pretty good deal too
If England really believed it would be significantly better off by itself, a Brexit deal wouldn’t be so important to them
It’s goes back to the saying “just because you can doesn’t mean you should”, England will probably be fine but it’s just super unnecessary when you balance everything out

My mom is an experienced hobby mountaineer and she was trekking up a mountain in the Pyrenees in Spain and halfway up she met a dutch couple and the poor man was exhausted sitting on a rock by the side of the path and my mom said hi and asked if they were alright and the poor man could only say in a very rudimentary spanish: "I come from the Netherlands
aaaall flat
So it became a family's inside joke: now when we are tired sometimes we say "aaaaaall flat" (in spanish with a dutch accent) :P

Well yeah, otherwise I don't see why else you'd be mad at Irish people wanting unity
Then ignore it, from what I've seen most threads about Ireland there are usually very few 1 upvote comments about unity and if it makes them happy then sure they could go for it
As long as nobody is calling for violence, in which case I'd agree with you
Turkey is strangely empty
I didn't know Crimea had so many people
I am moving to Norway
It's almost an inverse population density map for Spain
I'm guessing because there's just so many small municipalities in the center
And they are basically all organized so they will have at least around 1000 since they will put several towns in the same municipality
Which isn't the case on reality
I would guess that if the map is correct, there are villages of 1001 people evenly distributed, instead of concentrated on small areas
Props to the 1% that doesnt know that france exists
I have the feeling Spain got that rating because we are a nice vacation place
The British love britain the most
Why is Spain so high
Do they really love our beaches so much
Im really proud of my country, Spain
I recommend you all to visit us, tourism is pretty safe right now, specially because hotels and beaches are 100% desinfected and almost empty due to COVID19 fear
My vacations this year, have been one of the best i have ever had here in Spain
You're less well known, I guess
Norway is closer, Sweden is more popular, and Germany is overwhelming
So you're kind of in the middle

This is the reason why Spain gained so much experience in building public infrastructures
When building motorways or high speed lines they always try to find a natural path for it, but sometimes that's not possible and they have to build some long tunnels and viaducts:

I worry about Brexit because I have plenty of British friends who are afraid and I share their pain
Besides that, I solidarize with my fellow British workers, who are going to pay for what I think will be a disaster
At the end of the day, a good British worker is closer and more important to me  than Amancio Ortega or Emilio Botin
If I didn't care about the future of many in the UK, I wouldn't care about Brexit either

I don't think Johnson is doing that only to see the remainers stop no deal in two weeks
>Is there any sort of Brexit deal on the table that is acceptable to Parliament and to the EU
Short answer: no
Long answer: the debate around the UK-EU relationship post-Brexit involves three things:
* Will there be a border between the UK (or at least Great Britain) and the EU
No border means common market, border means the UK can freely negotiate trade agreements with third countries (like the USA, hi Trump)
* Will there be a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
No border means NI must be inside the EU common market, border means trouble because of the IRA
* Will there be a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain
No border means NI and GB must have the same status, for good or for bad
Border means NI and GB have a different status
The problem here is that Brexiters actually want three things:
They want a border between the UK/GB and the EU
They want no border between NI and the Republic of Ireland
They want no border between NI and GB
And that's simply impossible
You can only pick two of them, but you must leave the other one out
Why
Because different markets need hard borders between them, and same market means no border
For example:
* If you take 1 and 2, you get GB isn't part of the EU market but NI is
Then, to separate the EU market and the GB market, there must be a border between NI and GB, so no 3
* If you take 1 and 3, you get the entire UK (GB and NI) isn't part of the EU market, then, to separate the UK market and the EU market, there must be a border between NI and RI, so no 2
* If you take 2 and 3, you get RI and NI are part of the same market and NI and GB are part of the same market, the EU market, then, you have no border between the UK and the EU, so no 1
Theresa May wanted the three of them and that is simply impossible
Now Boris Johnson has even given up negotiating and is going for a no deal
No deal means 1 and 3
There will be a border between NI and RI
Can someone explain this
I mean what it is
I'm sorry but the night train from Madrid to Lisbon is awful
the reason they voted out was a combination of the refugee crisis, and people like nigel farage convincing britons that their lives are shit (1) and it's because of immigrants (2)

In Spain we just make you pronounce hard words for your language to have fun

Then we teach them how to properly curse
for english speakers I teach them with "e how d put e"
everything with a soft "r" like "carta" or Z "zapato, cerveza
Well, it's your Spanish heritage, depending on the region it's "co", "chacho", "Acho", "rapaz", "pisha", "quillo" etc

It's an average
If it was the median, it would probably be lower since the typical earner nets within the range of about 20-25k euro a year
> Fun fact but plane tickets there are twice as expensive to Asia than to USA which I find funny because both are roughly the same distance
Get to a city served by Emirates and Qatar and look from there
Be amazed at how cheap it can be to fly to Asia through magic of competition
Finnair also has a lot of capacity to Asia
> we get only 26 days per year so changing plane means I effectively sacrificed 1 - 2
5 weeks of vacation is plenty to be able to sacrifice a few days for transportation
I'm aware
I also work
I just used 15 days for a trip to Japan
Of course I would have liked more but that was plenty of time and managed to see Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima and plenty of day trips from there
it seems they're paid in potatos too
Also Gaudí didn't leave detailed plans for it which complicates things as we want it to be close to what he once envisioned
Their budget has also increased a lot in recent years
In 2019 it was ~100M€, with ~50 allocated to construction
They basically have zero issues with financing, which is usually the limiting factor
Don't worry, by the time it is finished the restoration works will start
