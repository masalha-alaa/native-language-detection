Well a lot of people other than Serbs don't know much about the Croatian nazi group called Ustaše(Ustashe) who were leading a puppet government in Croatia during WW2
Supposedly their concentration camps were much worse than any Nazi German one(btw they were mostly for Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and  people who didn't support the regime)
They also had a special concentration camp for children in Sisak
For what I know people were killed mostly with cold weapons like knives, axes, hard objects and other shit like gas
Someone told me they also used Rollers to squish people too but idk
Other dark facts about Croatia are that eastern Croatia is literally dying slowly and noone is giving a shit
We killed some serbs in ww2 and they killed some croats in croatian homeland war 1991-95
By some I mean few thousand
And both nations declined that those happened even tho croatia like indenpended country didnt exist in ww2 it was puppet state NDH
Molio bih da se nitko ne svađa u komentarima
Hvala
In Croatia, atheists have to financially support the Catholic Church via taxes that bring up to 150 million euros a year
Priests, often openly pro-Nazi, are employed in schools and hospitals
Secularity is only a sentence in the Constitution
Opposition to this in public often results in threats and intimidation
This type of shit happened in Yugoslavia mid to late 20th century
Mostly Serbia though
Wait a sec, your flair isn't Croatia
I imagine its hard to do when people who speak out against Putin end up mysteriously dead
I believe that the Boer Wars which is what they're taliking about was the first ever usage of concentration camps
Yeah cpncetration camp can refer to both internemant camps and death camps
In this case they we're used to counter guerilla warfare but the conditions in the camp we're pretty bad so lots of people died of diseases
Croatia
Easy, slovenia
Nothing against our neighbours but that would make our coastline even more awesome
The whole country would be a peninsula
We'd lose in tourism tho because austrians would get the sea and all the germans would probably wanna go there instead of here but fuck it
#worthit
Or france just for the fun of it and make europe an archipelago
Serbi
oh you said EU only
Damn
Slovenian coastline finally expands from 2 km into 3
(jk love you neighbours)
Elaborate
Don't worry, Germany will be killed off by their own stupid politicians and demographics
I'd prefer Serbia be gone, I could take a boat to Kosovo
I thought we were friends :(
As a Croatian, I am very saddened by this thread
Noatia
Nervatska
like we don't have enough problems on our own
also, the UK isn't a big enough global player to affect me in any way
once they leave the EU, following their politics would be just as ridiculous as following Chilean politics
Okay yeah his politics are shit but no he's not Trump
Brexit is happening so we might as well have someone who campaigned in favor of it do it, so that Brexiters can't moan forever that they've been backstabed and got the wrong kind of brexit
Fighting in 1848 to get rid of Hungarian domination just to be returned to it in 1868
Krbava Battle
The ottoman army demanded they pass trough the Croat territory without conflict
Croats said f\*ck it and attacked them in the open field
Lost almost all of our nobility in that battle
The entire history after the hungarians
I would say union with Hungary started it all in 1102
Wasn't the guy actually competent ruler, so much that Montenegrins didn't want him to leave when they discovered he was a liar ?
That would make him an impressive chad
What makes it even worse that the guy leading the whole thing (Emerik Derenčin) could've just ambushed the Turks and be done with it, but he was like "Nah, that's not honorable"
Kinda
I don't know if we broke all ties with them in 1527
Croatian intellectuals had the similiar liberal wishes like Hungarian ones except that they were less decisive to declare ouright independence and Hungarian nationalism was seen as bigger threat
Anyway, Croats didn't like to fight for the crown just so they be can returned to Hungarian rule (although pro-Hungarian Croatian nobility had their hands in it too)
Living in a cold, poorly managed, uncomfortable looking farm house made of concrete
Yes, in buildings like this:
Those apartments were built for young families and were sold for 1000 eur/m2, apartments in normal new buildings in Zagreb usually cost 2-4k eur/m2 and they're located in better neighbourhoods and they are built way better
Yeah but you can be middle class and still live in a concrete commie building, in the Ex-Yu commie blocks are a sign of quality ( big wide streets, lots of parks, comfy buildings
New apartment buildings look more socialist than those built 40 years ago
Well a lot of our Yugoslav apartment blocks are kinda nice, this is Dugave neighbourhood in Zagreb, built 40 years ago:
Nowdays it looks even better because of tall trees
No but as someone working in a field where everything is in english and it is de facto lingua franca, looking for terms in native language is such a pain
As someone who moved to Germany last year, this kinda sound like my colleague from Schwaben
I don't like it at all
I hold a great dislike toward my accent
Well thank you for making me feel nice for 2 seconds
But I'll still dislike it
Well iPhone is much more expensive here, and it's just a phone
I've wondered that as well
I use Android, I knew it will be my choice before I got my first smartphone because I tried both and just preferred Android look and feel
I used Symbian phone before my Android, and didn't switch until it stopped working
I wasn't even aware of the large price difference then
That being saidy the entire iPhone vs Android thing is so childish and ridiculous
Only recently (iPhone 11) did Apple start to market a bit more than usual
Still not _nowhere near as much_ as Samsung and Huawei
Also, the 11 pro max costs $1700
There are no Apple stores in Croatia, only licensed sellers
I think this where you can use the phrase ''stupid americans''
We mostly buy our phones and service plans separately
Also, we don't see iPhone being good value for money
Some of us are irritated by the closed ecosystem
That's definitely an Android advantage, I really appreciate the freedom of choice
>my Samsung S9+
>Also the camera blows any Apple phone out of the water
Honestly baffled by these replies
Android users saying iPhone users don't know anything about tech and then they say shit like this
iPhone 11 definitely has a better camera than the S10 according to
everyone
So I don't know how you possibly could think that your S9 is better
> but do windows computers and androids even connect to each other
I've never heard of anything that connects them
Yes, they do
I mean, Microsoft ditched Windows Phone (and Windows 10 Mobile) because it was a disaster and decided to stick with Android
Their dual screen phone, [Surface Duo] will come with Android too
Beside that, Windows 10 even comes with the app called [Your Phone] It basically enables you to see everything from your phone right on the PC
You can send SMS via PC, receive notifications, make and recieve calls, and more
i've got a feeling that americans are really shallow when it comes to phones
and i got this feeling just by seeing shit on reddit and nothing else so maybe i'm way off
anyways, i feel like a phone is a way of showing off while here it's considered as a helpful gadget and nothing else
people don't care which phone you have other than "your phone makes shitty photos, let's use mine". i mean we have other things which we're shallow about, for example cars
people really like to show off their german made cars around here but phones, yeah, nobody cares
also, i'm talking about grown ass men, kids in school probably care about their phones
you always have to be special, don't you
Split, I know it has the palace and very nice sea and a lot more but when I came tourists were everywhere and the palace it self wasn't special at all and stores were everywhere even in the palace
Also when I first came in an old woman took a dump in the trash like wth
But I gave it the benefit of the doubt since a lot of my friends actually like Split so I guess I either went to the wrong places or I was just too distracted from seeing the dump
Also Hajduk signs were everywhere even graffiti style prayers for the club on the churches but I guess they really like their team so whatever I guess
How would you describe Aarhus
Just curious because I'm moving there soon
lolol about the dump wow
What town or region are you from
Just curious
Belišće Slavonia :D
Haha
Ok I can see that being a bit of a culture shock
I’m from Istra
not all of us coastal ppl are shitting in the garbage
That's actually how people think of you
Punctual, organised, reliable
Like a Swiss watch
When I was in high school, my classmate (who was always late) used the excuse that the tram he was in had an uncontained fire and burnt down which was obviously bullshit
Funnily enough, the very next day he was late again and it turned out the tram he was in actually caught on fire and had to be evacuated
Newly employed secretary who just can't seem to stop trying to suck up to Germany in every concievable way
We are the President of the Board, and we run the company via zoom calls only
We will continue to do zoom calls by July 30
We don't really know why we run zoom calls so much, but we do know we will stop July 30
It will then be Germany's problem, not ours
The Ey-Yugoslav countries would be the ones who constantly complain about his office neighbours to the chief, but they hang out with each other at every coffee break
Hungary is buying guns and they probably want a coastline
Well you never know, and I said it more as a joke but since Orban is now almost a dictator you can expect anything
Noone knows if NATO would intervene in a conflict in central europe maybe they would just let it go like the UN sometimes
Well democracy in Hungary is kind of nonexistent at the time and other countries are doing similar things like Hungary with direct control(totalitarianism) and dictatorship like Poland or Finland and USA is kind of in a pickle with the corona thing so it is a perfect opportunity for democracies to crumble and wars to pop up
The same thing happened before WW2(democracies crumbling not a pendemic) so the world may enter some conflicts soon but maybe not
Haha hope not a nuclear WW3 and this is not confirmed to be clear I said maybe
Wow I didn't know he said that
fuck
Well, old-sounding are probably male names ending with -slav or -mir, and depending on preceding word they can vary from popular (Tomislav, Miroslav, Krešimir, Branimir) to archaic (Držislav, Višeslav, Vojnomir, Trpimir)
For female names I would go with Buga, Kata/Katica, Slava/Slavica
But for really archaic names, pretty much nonexistent in circulation, one must simply look at the catholic calendar with patron saints and pick one (Eleuterije, Krescencije)
Gvozden and Dragomila I think
Janja - Croatia
If Bolek is shortened for Boleslav, what is Lolek short for
similar in croatian
Male names are glorious sounding and sometimes even usable/used
Females are just weird
Inga is a rare name here but not considered old, huh
wait, Gervais is a proper name
We have streets named after a poet whose surname was Gervais
Now I can only dream of meeting Gervais Gervais
I know a bunch of Kata/Katica of all ages, although Slavica's are usually women in their 50's or older
It's funny to me that you can even combine the suffixes for more names
Branimir and Miroslav are two well-known names in Croatia
Radislav and Branislav also exist, we just need a Slavislav now :P
Is Srbobran really used as a name
PS I know only one Miodrag who is neither mio (kind) or drag (nice)
Is Uroš an archaic name ?
all ruza/ruzica, jagoda, visnja, malina etc are old women in their 60s at least
I cant think of young ruza
I know maybe a handfull of them, and all of them are 70+.
They are originally mostly names of kings or other rulers since those are the names that were perserved (Im not sure if we know any common folk names from 10th century or so - I know there was a monk named Držiha though)
Well, some of them are now maybe a bit old-fashiony
For example, while I know several Tomislav under 30, most Miroslavs are 50+ men
Some are pretty much nonexistent in modern times (Trpimir, Vojnomir etc
I think it mostly comes from such names being "long" when compared to most names that are popular now, or still popular such as Luka, Filip, Marko, Tin, Leo, Ivan
Same thing with girls
I was tutoring, and 90% of students were included in Ana, Lana, Lara, Lea, Mia, and Iva
At the same time, Kristina, Katarina or Mirjana, which are more traditional names are getting rare
Others won't understand why it's kinda funny
Those Poles and their crazy language :P
IMO Katica and Slavica are not "ancient" sounding like Beowulf but more along the lines "someone born between 1880 and 1960" lol
Janja is uncommon in my part of Croatia, but I would say it falls into the same category of an old-fashioned name
its not, by by by Earth, but its by, by humans
Croatia has the smallest town in the world, Hum, located in Istria
According to Alfred Hitchcock, the city of Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world
Croatia enjoys 2715 hours of sunshine per year and the island of Hvar is the sunniest place in Europe
We have 1246 islands, isles and imlets
Some of our most recognizable inventions are: necktie, torpedo, pen, suspension bridges, dactyloscopy, electric speedometer
Bonus fact: Croatia is home to the Walls of Ston, 2nd largest preserved forticifation system, right after the Great wall of China
Romania is by far the most underrated country for tourism
I can actually pronoumce the name of that village
After peactice :D
Also Kopacki Rit one of the last preserved swamp systems in Europe and Papuk which is also a geopark because when the pannonian sea existed Papuk was an island and now has unique mountain structure seen nowhere else in the world, and the great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth was born in Osijek(city in Croatia) . Just wanted to put some inland stuff  because people usually talk about the coastline
Awesome
Slavonia is usually ignored by tourist since our coastline is much more attractive, but it's actually really beautiful with lots of places that are worth a visit
Laszlo Biro invented the ballpoint pen, but Slavoljub Penkala invented the mechanical/automatic pencil which was later developed into a fountain pen
I go there every summer since my grandparents live on the southern coast of the island
God forbid I forget to put on sunscreen
I'm sorry, hwat
Yes
Tesla was an inventor
Not a scientist
It is a shameyou guys don't really have highways and railroads for what I heard but I really wanna go to Transylvania because you know caatles and stuff
Also beatiful towns and cities and I'm pretty close too like a 5h drive to Timisoara which is not in Transylvania but still a nice city too
Well yes Slavonia can't compare with Dalmatia in beauty only in cuisine(Slavonia has far better food-change my mind) but yes some places are worth a visit especially geothermal springs and castles whom are also in Slavonia but also in Zagorje
Communists are still ruling the country from the shadows by controlling both the main left wing and right wing party is more widespread belief than people like to admit
That, and also that the war (ended 25 years ago) and socialism and Yugoslavia (ended 30 years ago) and Tito (died 40 years ago) are to blame for everything bad that is going on today
And millions of Muslims want to live in Hungary, nowhere else
[And the map is ready
Croatia, too
Just yesterday we had a debate on our sub about it
One guy said Soros has a dark ulterior motive with all donations and scholarships, but doesn’t know what it is
Reading this thread thinking me "what penis
" :D
There certainly interesting examples, but that is difficult actually communicating
Think that is Croatian, as and other slavic languages, very efficient, because can say same amount of information in less words
(For example that sentence when in english is missing couple of layers, about the subject and object of the sentence
"Literally not much would change
You can to speak completely normally because infinitive, even though sound farmer-like little
" Yeah, this is bad haha
Never didn't think that will this be so fun, but and difficult
"German is so weird sometimes
You want to speak but you sound like Russian that tries to speak English
Then write in \[the\] naturalest order for your language
Don't know, think yes sometimes could work
Depends from the situation
Fucking answer
This with penis is law
It really me laugh
Or both, honestly
Glad to me that I found croatians in thread
Worried myself that wouldn't be able to find anyone, because really wanted to see some examples on croatian
Funny to me is that you first mentioned penis, very typical for us
I know, slavic languages are generally like that ;)
Precisely, even though me is more dear swearword "fuck your dog mother". It seems me as if English lacks adequate swearwords
But, this sound as if write someone who is had brain stroke
Pfff, we lost to slovenia but i really hope we'll lose all the games and end up dead last
That's a nice way to protest it
And a nice way to send some other teams to the WC for the first time like gibraltar, cyprus, andorra and maybe san marino
Who knows
Well of course
It's simple reciprocity in international law
That man has an indesputably large brain
>  I have approximately 2 sons
I love this one
Gotta also give credit to that guy (you can tell me who it is, I only saw a clip online) that said "The death rate is low, but for those who die, the death rate is 100%"
Lol, I don't know him, but I saw a parody song about him done by JOE called "Because I Got High" and I thought it was just a joke about his appearance and that it can't have been true
But he publicly admitted
Ajoj
Mi smo isprva mislili da smo se usrećili s našim ljudima, koji su isprva djelovalo neobično sposobno
Ali naposljetku je ministar zdravstva, na pitanje tko je odgovoran za smrt velikog broja članova staračkog doma u Splitu, gdje je bilo puno sumnjivih radnji, rekao "meni se čini da je kriv virus". A ravnatelj doma na poziciju postavljen po stranačkoj liniji
Ne bismo mi bili mi da kod nas sve prođe bez vrijeđanja inteligencije naroda
I would say not as hardcore as running through the fields of wheat, but damn
Hahah
Closing cafes
They're still operating, so no crisis yet
Haha
Look at these virgins being healthy
I mean I agree Yugoslavia exploded in a million pieces but that doesn't stop me from being offended
Rails = economy
Rails, rails, rails, rails
I love rails and I will forever love them
Imagine if the entire EU had a network like France
Man that would be awesome
Rails, rails, rails, rails
Definetly in Croatia cars are faster than trains lmao it takes around 6 and a half hours to get from the easternmost point to Zagreb and it takes 3
5 with a car(something like 230 km)
"Overencumbered". As you might imagine, I saw it in a video game
My first game was Diablo II where "overburdened" was used so I thought that's the only word for it
I initially read the other one as "overcucumbered" and thought it was just a silly in-game expression until I saw it in another game and read it properly, haha
Wait that's not how you pronounce it
Have you seen those warriors from Hammerfell
They've got curved swords
Curved
Swords
Not really
Germans are probably one of the most well-liked and respected people here
Austrians too
When you say Slavic you can count Balkans out because germany is the light at the end of the tunnel for us
No its not its opposite we love germans most of us
Nah we croats love you because our people are leaving our country to go live in yours (money)
Not really, but, sadly, there are still Croatians who associate with the idea of Nazism
There are not a lot of them, but they are pretty radical
That's why a lot of people are terrified to come here
Also, when someone comes they immediately notice the swastikas and Nazi chants written on the walls, especially near football stadiums
Pretty sad
But when you ask about today's Germans, we have stereotypes like for every other people
They are not necessarily anti-German, but they do exist
I just learned Kinder is from Italy and not from Germany
Are there any other brand to country mismatches you have had
F1 fans know it
We actually have some connection, Dieter Mateschitz (Matešić) is of Croatian origin
Wait, isn't red bull from Thailand
Wait, what
It is going bad for us because of our demography, lots of old people, so we end up having less money for the healthcare system which is currently in debt
Because we are in the EU our medical professionals have a tendency of leaving the country for better pay and work conditions
if i remember, NY first fire brigade was private and i saw story where they were arranging price for puting out fire while the house was on fire
shortly after they made them city care
same was with Pinkerton agency
What everyone seems to forget is that the U.S. is a huge federal republic, with enormous differences between states
Some states are like Sweden, but many states are similar to poorest EU members
Providing Sweden-like quality universal health care to the whole USA would be like if EU provided highest quality insurance to all member states, which is not the case
Each European country has their own universal healthcare and the quality varies massively
However, I'm sure that most people still prefer it instead of american-like system
Maybe the correct path for the US would be that each state comes up with their own universal healthcare, instead of waiting for the federal government to figure out how to deploy Sweden-like healthcare to some of their states which are equivalents of Croatia/Hungary/Bulgaria/etc
I would (and do) drink tap water pretty much anywhere in the country
idk everyone i know drinks tap water infact people usally by bottled water or a soda drink it and then when they are going somewhere they take the empty bottle and fill it with water from the tap
Absolutely
In Croatia tap water is perfectly safe to drink
If I buy bottled water at home it’s only if it’s sparkled
Except in Split after a heavy rain
I live in Ireland but i am from BiH/Cro
There is a reason we dont pay for the water in Ireland, **i dont drink it** ,only if i run out of bottled one
Bosnian Water is way cleaner than Any of these county's, and Croatian is drinkable
Being a politican or owner of a company and not stealing from everyone you can
Or when entering the bus
Say hello to the driver
Wow, didn't know this was a thing outside the Balkans
Based Nordics
The first paragraph gives me great enjoyment
This is why we love Italians
Let me guess, when they finally sit down, they complain about how everything hurts and aches
Sounds oddly familiar
Tru dat
Poland can't into space, but it can into Ireland
That doesn't mean they're the least chauvinistic
In general the ex-Yougoslavian states are pretty tolerant of other races its other balkan people that prople here can't stand
Nah hate here just isn't based on race its based on nationality or religion
They or they parents were in the war
People need time, wounds caused by atrocities of war dont heal that fast
Honestly, it varies a lot from person to person
Over here the stereotype is that people who left to work in other countries either remain/become completely chill and indifferent towards the old issues, or they become the biggest nationalists around
I’m not kidding when I say that the biggest extreme nationalists tend to be expats or their children, longing for a magical perfect homeland that never existed in the first place
The confusing thing is that most of them left because things were economically shit, so I can’t really understand that comical level of romanticism
Really stabbing
I mean croatia and serbia have shit amount of unregistered weapons on both sides and never heard of incident similar to stabbing
Also in Croatia situation is mostly normal, excet maxbe in eastern slavonia
Well eastern Slavonia around Vukovar and Vukovar itself is a breathing ground for nationalists but other parts of Slavonia are mostly ok except maybe a few places like Voćin or some parts of Baranja
The joke in Zagreb tends to be that when we hear thunder or the sirens are blaring (as part of maintenance), “the Slovenes are sending an elite bycicle brigade from Maribor”.
I never knew Voćin is probčematic
Yeah rest of slavonia, kordun, banija are pretty ok these days
I mean it's been 25 years, both serbs and croats marry again among each other
I'm not saying it's not possible, indeed it is
I think these are mostly rural folks
However I witnessed stabbing between albanians and croats if that counts
I think girl was in question
I think you never heard of a place called Balkans
Half of Croats were in partisans, half in Homeguard and some in Ustashe forces
Serbs in either Chetnik forces or Partisans
Until 1943
you had a clusterfuck with good saying * Ne zna se tko pije a tko plaća* in eng
* You don't know who is drinking and who is paying for it*. By the 1943
Ustashe regime was backed by nazi germany and italy, chetniks officially by Allied powers but unoffiacially had Riotta's strategic and areal help and you had partisans backed by red army which in initial years couldn't help herself let alone partisans
Well Vocin had that genocide and they are naturally very sensitive about it and there are also still some Serbs in the area
I rarely stumble on some regional content on the internet without seeing comments about the war, whose politicians are crazier, or who does Tesla belong to
Interesting thing is, I have never met someone from Serbia in person that wasn't a totally cool person that doesn't give two shits about these topic
Been in Belgrade 3 times, mostly normal people, just don't talk about war, that's it
Eat, drink, have a great time
Spot on
I used to live in northern Germany for a couple of years and was severely depressed
Just a month of being in my hometown on the coast made me feel a lot better both in mind and body
The sea and coast are magic
It is the same for coastal Croatia
Very true
Except for the Scandinavian folk
They're monsters
Hearing that from a spanish person is indeed high praise :)
For real
Whenever I go visit home breathing in that sea air gives me a nice high
The fucking state of it all when you think not getting executed in public is good enough
In Croatia we do pranks when we can and want
But we do have a tradion at the end of the 4th year (12th grade) where students who graduated high school take part in a huge graduation parade and party, called "Norijada". The parade has caused controversies over the past few years because incidents such as causing fires, getting arrested, vadalising properties etc
have become a common occurrence
But it is also a lot of fun since rearly anyone gets injured, students spray eachother with water guns and pistols (mostly pouring alcochol in it instead of water), throw flour and eggs at eachother, blow whistles REALLY LOUD, dance, sing and parade (occupy) the entire cities and towns (traffic usually collapses during that time of the day)
Zar se to ne zove Ludi Dan
Nikad nisam čula za naziv "Norijada" niti da je to parada
Ne, Norijada je naziv za to
Ja nikada nisam cuo za "Ludi dan". Odakle si uopce, s obale negdje
Jer ja sam iz Slavonije
Cak i u Zagrebu kazu Norijada
A sto se dijela parade tice
to je zapravo parada samo u Zagrebu, jer idu nekom rutom ne znam tocno kojom
Toga kod nas nema
Jok, nisam s obale
Dobra stara regija Banija,nedaleko od Siska
Nezz, kod mene tu je Ludi Dan, i u mom gradu, i u Sisku i cijeloj okolici
Oce to tako kod nas u Hrvatskoj
Svako selo svoj dijalekt/naglasak
Haha Jbg eto sad znamo oboje da ima vise naziva za to
Apsolutely, in smaller towns it is completely normal to say hi to everyone on the streets
Yeah
It's also nice to do it in rural areas
But if the hiking trail is too busy, it can become boring
Yes, definetly
People do it all the time when hiking on Sljeme
We usually have a little (forced) chat with them
"Hello"
"Hi"
"How's things
"Good"
"Good
*Stare at each other awkwardly*
"Well I better get going"
"Yeah, me too"
Is it wrong to use "hallo" in Austria
My german is limited to basics like asking for directions, ordering food and having simple conversations and everytime I was in some shop or elsewhere I greeted cashiers/staff with hallo and one time some old lady looked at me like I've just murdered someone
Drinking coffee on a nearby terrace during work hours
It is considered that you are an important and successful person if you can spend a large part of your daily work drinking coffee in a local pub that usually has a terrace because the point is to be seen
During that time (that is no less than 2 hours) your friends come and change around your table, you usually pay the bill for the ones you appreciate and themes vary from plain gossip about certain people to open political activism
Also, very popular topics are deciding who should and who shouldn't play in a national football team, various local sexual affairs and getting services from various people
If some bigger task arose or you have to treat someone with respect for what they did for you, then the jolly boys switch to the restaurant with lamb or pork meat to seal their friendship
Often, it is not about coffee, you can order a small glass of tap beer, "gemišt" (white wine with sparkling water), Jaegermeister or something stronger
It is very important for your social and professional life and is a must-do for local businessmen, public servants, managers and so on
Information rules the world and around those tables, most horrifying secrets are revealed, and the smartest philosophical concepts constructed
Is it like an Obelix situation there, just like he fell into a pot of that strength potion when he was a kid which made him strong his entire life
A Greek baby is dipped in olive oil and can now forever cook or grow magnificent food forever
We have Krampii as well
We have him in Croatia also, although that makes sense
I’m having panic attack just thinking about it
Spanish people kiss and during introductions with complete strangers
Had very unfortunate incident involving a kiss, a finger and an eye
Gemischt
Well, the Croatian language is full of Germanisms
Before this americanization, Croatia was culturally connected with the German-speaking part of Europe
Part of Austria-Hungary
My grandma used to read German books in gothic letters, yet we are not Germans
It's nice if you're in that company, it's cringe for everone around them
She has heels, too
Maybe he should switch to Buldožer immediately
Or Pankrti
Or some other band/author, hell now I remember them all, one by one, even Pepel in kri
OK, I'll start with Navihanke
Don't worry, it was and is all nice, I like Slovenia
Cheers
Sretan Božić! :)
Sretan Božić i sretna Nova godina
“K’o Rusa i Kineza zajedno”.
You say this if there are a lot of people at one place, i.e. like Russians and Chinese combined
"Ružan ko Turčin" - "You are ugly like a Turk"
"Lažeš ko Srbin"- "You lie like a Serb"
"Pušiš ko Turčin" - "You smoke like a Turk"
"Točan ko Švicarski sat" - "As precise as a Swiss watch" it means that you are right on time
In Croatian we have “špansko selo”, translated as Spanish village
It’s used when you want to say you have absolutely no clue about the topic
Not sure about the etymology, though
Same here, except we use "wild west" instead
Yes its people from Istria and Dalmatia(can understand them more then Istrians) we speak Croatian but bro its hard to understand them
how do you use đ in a unique way
i kinda wanna know
ah i see
"You are going to live under a bridge" or "If you don't get an education you are gonna work in agriculture" this one is one of the reasons why Croatian agriculture is failing
Every male kid wanted to probably
it's funny that this thread has turned mostly into "what americans thought about my country that was wrong" ://
Hey, why do you have Croatian and Slovenian flag and Istria in your flair
I mean forcing parents to feed their children is techically forcing substances into that child
Do you support legalising starving a child until they're dead
Good luck tracing which anti vaxxer gave you the flu a month before
In addition, when herd immunity breaks down there is a higher chance of virus mutating (because it reproduces drastically more)
Eventually one of those mutations is different enough that it can infect vaccinated people as well, because it is no longer the same virus
Makes sense
There isnt a natural desire for vaccinations, there's a desire to not die of a fucking disease though
We have "typical" translation errors in restaurant menus
It's not that hard to find automatic translations such as "pasta s kozicama" which should be pasta with prawns" translated as "pasta with chickenpox" since name for that particular disease is "(vodene) kozice". There are a couple of other "usual" ones
handjobs are standard cheap/poor translations for any hand made stuffs (souvenirs, food, items, jewelery
) that is sold to tourists since its a direct translation of croatian term (ručni rad)
For us this is actually pretty normal
Though we haven't yet gottento summer summer temperatures (apparently its gonna be getting to 40C)
Ive been bracing myself fro then
It’s all fine here
It is a bit hot sometimes but a week or two ago it was freezing cold with terrible whether
It's not that bad
Just remember us in cooler times after we're all gone
its finally summer here
We had overcast and rainy weather for weeks now
Pretty much the weather inversly correlates with covid
When its nice outside you cabt go due to virus
Then when restrictions get lifted the weather sicks
Yes, die
Yeah
It was so weird that when last year it was sunny and crazy hot, now it’s raining and cold
And now it’s warm when it should be much warmer
You see bosnia espacially is a very spicy situation
We see ourselves as bosnian croats coz' we're not from croatia so we aren't croats
But ethnically speaking we're not bosnians either
At the other hand everyone from bosnia kinda is generally speaking a bosnian but "bosnian" splits into bosnian croat, bosniak and bosnian serb
Tho the bosniaks are most likely to refer to themselves as bosnians
Bosniaks are Muslims from bosnia (they make up like 45% of the population) so that's what differanciates them from bosnian croats/-serbs
Bosnian croats-/serbs are just serbs/croatians born on the Territory of Bosnia and Hercegovina
I hope this wasn't all to confusing but it probably is
Then the 2nd thing: i was born and live in switzerland
So in my home-canton (region) im the croat, but in other cantons i'm the dude from "my homecanton"
Oh my god, i found one in the wild
Good for you man
I read a couple of days ago about a pro boxer from herzegovina who refused to fight under croatian flag because he's bosnian
Thats how it should be
I lived in sarajevo until the war, first 6 years of my life, and then i moved to croatia
Now i feel croatian because i grew up here, bosnia is just another neighbouring country to me
In Croatia it might be Glina
Its more of a town, rather than a city, but people think its disgusting
I have never been there, so I can't really confirm
Also, glina in Croatian litteraly means clay
Of bigger cities i would sadly say Rijeka
Its industrial/port town with lots of derelict and abandoned industrial sites in the centre and right by the coast
Our tour guide said Mestre was the ugliest city in Italy and the people there knew it
Article 1
The Republic of Croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic and social state
Power in the Republic of Croatia derives from the people and belongs to the people as a community of free and equal citizens
The people exercise the power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making
This is the first article of the constitution, but before the first article we have a preamble that talks about the historical fundations for a sovereign Croatian state
**ARTICLE I.**
>The Republic of Croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic and social state
In the Republic of Croatia, power comes from the people and belongs to the people as a community of free and equal citizens
The people exercise power by electing their representatives and direct decision-making
**ČLANAK I.**
>Republika Hrvatska jedinstvena je i nedjeljiva demokratska i socijalna država
U Republici Hrvatskoj vlast proizlazi iz naroda i pripada narodu kak zajednici slobodnih i ravnopravnih državljana
Narod ostvaruje vlast izborom svojih predstavnika i neposrednim odlučivanjem
I've heard a russian youtuber (NFKRZ) call the Russian constitution the greatest work of fiction ever written
Probably the Slavonia region, people left the area during the war, most of them never came back
The mountainous regions
They're mostly small villages with old townfolk because everyone from there is migrating to the more developed regions
That we had a pretty neat kingdom back in 10th century and didn't just appear as a nation out of the blue in 20th century
I was kinda expecting you would mention the coupe from a couple of years ago
Not to be pedantic but this is askeurope
It's not like you mentioned anything relevant to understanding of the development of any historical events
It's funny how hungarians always act as if there weren't any other nations trapped in the Habsburg monarchy
It's not like Croatia wasn't your 'colony' for many centuries
I excepted for Montenegro the fact that they were in war with Japan for about 100 years but this is also very interesting
That on its own makes it interesting
That too lol
You don't get to cry for being an imprisoned nation while imprisoning another one yourself
This might be a bit too far but in dalmatian dialetct you can almost have a conversation with only a,e,i,o,u.
other slavic languages have it for sure, but i like how there are 3 different words for "where" in croatian
gdje - vanilla "where", current location
kamo - "where" in the context of destination
kuda - "where" in the context of direction
I mean Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian are the same,so not much
But Croatian has 3 dialects,the first one shtokavian is the official language  (more-less tho it still has some words and style of speaking that aren't in the official language) spoken in the east and south(those subdialects are also different) , second one is kajkavian mostly Croatian-Slovenian but unintelligible sometimes too,it has its own words and speech accents and it is mostly spoken in northern/central Croatia
The last one is chakavian and only spoken in Istria, islands and some of continental Croatia
It is the smallest one and usually now spoken with only older people
It's basically Croatian with an Italian mix added to it
In Croatian, when saying "the two ^(or ^any ^other ^quantity) of you" , we can specify wether the people we're referring to are all male, female or mixed
Vas dvojica - the two of you (guys)
Vas dvoje - the two of you (mixed)
Vas dvije - the two of you (girls)
There are also other interesting characteristics in the Croatian language, but this was the first one to come to my mind
the only random thing i know about danish is your insane way of counting
You think french is weird, danish is out there miles beyond
Do you really use it in everyday speech
We also have super specific names for family relations (some of which you had to learn in elementary school IIRC) but they are rarely used
For example, we have "šukun" and "čukun djed", and I honestly can't remember which "tier" of grandfather they are
I know what "šurjak" means (sister's husband), but I would literally never use it because I don't want to sound like a 70 year old grandpa
If my uncle called me a "sinovac" I would get really irritated
Especially here in Dalmatia I mostly just call everyone (except my ancestors and siblings) either teta, barba (those two go for non-blood related people too, especially if I knew them from childhood and also as a generic term for unknown adult) or rođak
For example I can't remember anyone calling their firs cousins (uncle/aunt's children) by anything other than just "rođak". The only ones used semi regularly are the names for spouses parents, and children's spouses, but even then mostly in "mother-in-law" jokes
also "odakle" - where in the context of starting location or direction (Where are you from
Also, we have different names for months
Namely:
Siječanj, Veljača, Ožujak, Travanj, Svibanj, Lipanj, Srpanj, Kolovoz, Rujan, Listopad, Studeni, Prosinac
And I guess we have a lot of Slavic and/or Latin/ancient Greek words, since the standard Croatian language uses only words that are of these origins
For example, using a word that has roots in the German or English language would be incorrect and you'd have to find another word that has roots in the aforementioned ones
But that's just a fun fact, I guess lol
I feel like basque language would like to have a few words with you ;)
hey, croatians do that too
We even have songs written entirely in satrovacki
Btw, i have never heard someone use žili as a verb
Croatian is much more precise than the other two you mentioned
Yes, it does sound similar and we can understand each other, but saying that it's the same language is a bit of a stretch
Perhaps you didn't notice it or you were born in the 80s, but Croatian language puts much more emphasis on maintaining order inside the language
It actually has rules (not just grammatical wise) that you need to follow and the sentence structure is different
The other two are much more flexible when it comes to word choice, phrasing, etc
Saying that it's the same language deprives it of its own uniqueness and the effort that scholars of the Croatian language put into making it sound good and "rich". (As well as that of the other aforementioned languages)
Yeah I know
I think Czech as well
I study english and have to say that that's completely not true
( Think sentence structure wise
) Also, everything is political
Wait how does it work exactly in Slovenian
In Croatian its 1 stol, 2 stola, 3 stola, 4 stola and for 5 and above it's stolova
Oh okay, got it, yeah we have a special plural for 2-4 and then one for 5+
Neither
Both have downsides that, for me, are worse than that 20 days of mild inconvenience twice a year
Long dark winter mornings or early dark summer evenings
If I absolutely must pick one, then summer time, I guess
So you like oversleeping more of the daylight so you can have night come sooner
Shit, I wish I had a biorhythm like that
Dubrovnik (small city in the southern Croatia, former Ragusa Republic) completely banned slavery in 1416
That was 76 years before Columbus discovered US
EDIT: more info, if anyone is interested -
We take coffee brakes with friends for at least 3 hours and our work time is maybe one of the best in the world but I haven't checked(heard some rumors) . Quality of life is something that Croats like more than money
We hold the world record for the biggest popcorn and tge biggest neck tie
The necktie was made in Croatia and the guinness world record for the larggest necktie was made by Zoran Stankovic 18 October 2003 it was 808 metre(s), and the dalmatian dog's are from Dalmacija Croatia
Poles are therefore one of the two nations that can use the N-word freely
The other one being Montenegrins
While Croatia had war
That might be the thing I like the most about balkan and it's countries
I love hanging out for hours and eating meza
Everyone's hospitality is really wholesome to me
People think we just fight and cause ruckus (usually the ones who hate on eachother are the uneducated and the old that are passing it down onto other generations)
Otherwise we are quite similar and don't really start fights or something like that
Love from Croatia
Yes
We banned dragons last year, though
My bad
I basically just copied the title of the article
You stop consuming and they will stop producing
(oil consumption per capita of sweden is 3x of albania)
I might be a bit biased but a shrunken version of the Balkans
Lots of drugs, crime and corruption
An extremely varied and beautiful landscape and culture with the Mediterranean, Central European, Eastern European and Middle Eastern influence
The recent war which has people arguing politics and beliefs and due to the financial situation everyone is doing something illegal
Also having an American protagonist calling it Yugoslavia in modern times would be a fun stereotype of an ignorant American who still thinks that country exists
Naples or 90's St
Petersburg
Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade on the same map
Like GTA SA
You got football fan gangs, immigrant smugglers, drug labs, muttualy hating nationalities
All that good stuff
Palermo was my first thought as well
Also running red lights is pretty GTA-realistic
Also Niko Belić from GTA IV
Usually if you see a restaurant in the main street in city centre it's usually a trap
And especially if you see a guy infront of it trying to get people to come inside
It's albanian own 100%. Nothing against them but if you want to try traditional food you won't get it there
I'm talking about coastal towns, especially istrian ones
Zagreb is completely different, for example
There are a bunch of cool restaurants in zagreb centre
Old town of Dubrovnik
It is completely overrun by tourists and has lost it's charm because every single local resident has moved out of the old houses just for airbnb/hostels
It's just overpriced restaurants and cafes now surrounded by an amazing-looking fortress and walls
Probably the bigger towns on the coast like Split, Trogir and especially Dubrovnik
I personaly wasn't in Dubrovnik and I hope this isn't true but I heard that the main street Stradun has coffee with the price of 50 kuna (around 8 dollars) and the food like a normal pizza for 150kuna(around 65 dollars) which is an astronomic price compared to normal Croatian prices and in Zagreb the Tkalčićeva street is just a bunch of bars and restaurants that mostly are super expensive
Dubrovnik and the oldtown of Split (Diocletians palace)
In my humble opinion, very great destination indeed, with interesting sights and tales to tell, but any destination could be only so much crowded to be enjoyable
I'm quite sure that citizens of Dubrovnik are in a way relieved that nobody is coming this summer
I sure would enjoy walking the streets of my hometown without swimming in crowds of people (as I did this week)
Mass tourism in general seems like a big issue in Europe that not many are talking about
It's affecting local population big time and destroying famous landmarks
When I was in London around 10 years ago we planned on going there but the fare was way too fucking expensive so instead we went to the nearby Star Wars experience/convention thingy
That was so much fun
From the outside it looks amazing, from the inside it's quite boring imo
>Orbán claimed it for himself
He did WHAT
Lol there's so many of them that when we went there we even stopped noticing, wasn't even funny later
Lol
>trying to erase communist traditions
Yes, having an office within neo-Ghotic Austria-Hungarian building from the start of the 20th century, very communist indeed
It's petty either way and I doubt that it really "had to go". It's not like Hungary has a lot of democratic traditions to which it can return to anyway
What you told me sounds like just another way to wash more money and make the supreme leader feel even more comfortable and established
I don't drink alcohol and I don't enjoy summer or swimming in the sea
I regularly squat, even on a chair, and I like football
I have my own rakija, prefered coffee is turkish style
Played water polo
Go to the front page of this sub and you'll see three dots in the up right corner
When you click you can see the change user flair option
Not a good example on the whole, but I've heard Antony Hopkins's Romanian at the beginning of 1992 Dracula is pretty good
Niko is a popular Crotian name
Some Romanian was spoken in Captain America: Winter Soldier as well, no
The actor who plays Bucky Barnes is Romanian, IIRC
Silly Turks dont know that god is a Serb
Yeah
not sure if joking
Those types of jokes get real pretty quick in this area of the map
Don't be scared, Thats where I keep all my candy
We need to figure something out
The elections and the anti-lukashenko protests were mentioned, along with short background on him and how results are questionable
It was like 3rd news from world section, after corona and tanker oil spil in mauritius and before fire in czechia
But more or less it wasnt presented as a big deal and I doubt most people have any opinion about it one way or another
nah nfkrz needs to make a video abou that
i only remember hearing there were protests in serbia and bulgaria(idk if those are still happening)
Honestly, the entire health system
If I were there I would have no idea if to go to hospital, how much anything would cost etc
Fast food has been in Europe for awhile
I dont know if you think of mcdonalds as fast food or local private business like kebab or cevapi vendors
>The best advice is to get a hobby and meet people that way
How else do you meet people outside school/job
Grožnjan
A small town in Istria, often overlooked by coastal cities like Rovinj or Pula
Small, cosy, beautiful and you can feel the history in the air
I'd say in Croatia every city and town that is not on te coastline and isn't Zagreb is underrated like Varaždin, Osijek, Sisak and Vinkovci being examples but Osijek mostly since it has a swamp nature reserve a few kilometers from there, the tallest concathedral after the Zagreb cathedral was shortened, beatiful river with a path along it,  a cool bridge, the best cuisine in Croatia(arguable but true) and generally a beatiful Austro-Hungarian city with an old town fort(Tvrđa) in the center near the river
Ah, Montepaschi
I live my whole life in Croatia and I have literally never heard of this place
Gotta check it out
I think most people missed the point of the question, it's not about false friends, but words that sound similar and have similar meanings, but have developed from different forms (in linguistics, this is called ["false cognates"] Shame, because it's a really interesting question
One such example is "mucho" in Spanish and "much" in English, which derive from two completely different PIE sources
No it isn't.  The name "Scott" would in Serbian be pronounced *skaat* (like the *ska* in the music band "Ska-P", with a short *t* at the end)
The Serbian word "skot" on the other hand is pronounced the way Scottish people say *scottish* without the -ish
So, quite different, actually
That's a mispronunciation then
You can't mispronounce a word and say "look, we say it like this". The correct way to pronounce the English given name Scott is [ˈskɑ:t], which is very different from a Serbian word skot, all I'm saying
Sorry but I don't see anything in your link to prove different from what I said
The problem with europe is that all the "good" countries to live in have shitty weather
I'd love to live in iceland or denmark or norway but i don't want to spend my winters in below freezing temperatures and dark
Even belgium and netherlands arent very famous for good weather
On the other hand, spain, italy, south of france, albania, montenegro, greece
not the most appealing countries to live in and many of them wouldnt feel like an upgrade from the present situation
If i had enough money that i dont need to worry about it for the rest of my life i'd probably move to mauritius or something like that
Summer all year long, baby
You can live there with basic english no problem at all
>Palm trees and beaches won't pay your bills or **fill the holes in your life**
They would sure help
Bills would get paid by the money i have saved since i said "if i didnt have to worry about the money". If i get sick of it i'd just fly back home during the summer
What do i get here
Woohoo, i can get to vienna in 4 hours
When was the last time i did that tho
The only places i drove to in the last year were serbia and bosnia and i wouldnt lose much if i skip it in favor of living on an island paradise
This winter doesnt count
But yeah, denmark seems like a place to be
I've never been there sadly but it feels like a perfect mix between scandinavian countries and the netherlands, the best from both
Why did you pick those two
Why not greece or france
Regarding italy, i grew up in Pula, the biggest city on the istrian peninsula which is right next to italy
During august we get hundreds of thousands of italians flocking here and, i'm really sorry italians, but it's hard for me to endure that 1 month
Imagine living with them your whole life
It wasnt my intention to bash the italians here, to each their own, but i just can't take it, they arent my type of people
Also, italians are highly religious which i want to escape from here in croatia
Then there's the politics, they voted for berlusconi for years and years
That tells me their politics are a joke, just like in croatia which, again, i wanna escape from
Then the crime which happens down south (which is the place i'd like to live in italy), constant murders and shit
I dont know what to tell you about spain, i've been there only once, maybe i'm wrong
Let me organize a dream vacation for you then, it's in my freezer
You'll have everything your heart desires
I dont know what to tell you about the south of france, maybe it'd be better than now
Since a lot of you questioned some countries i asked myself why did i put them on the list in the first place
I know why italy is there, it's mainly because i find italians too loud, i think there's a lot of corruption in the country and other things which i wrote elsewhere
But now when i think about it i see that i lumped spain and france together without any proper reasons so maybe i'm wrong
I still think that spanish and french are too loud tho and i guess i wanna escape that "southern mentality" as well
Doubt it man
One of the worst things in the world is when i have to get up before 7 to go to work and then i step outside, snow everywhere, still dark, and i have to clean my fucking car
Wiping that white shit up and down while i'm freezing to death and while the snow is getting in my shoes
Fuck that
Its not for everyone
Here's an example, my wife loves the snow and the cold
Can't tell you how many times we had a fight when i got out the shower, entered the room to get dressed and i see the wide open window with -10 outside
I'd kill her right then and there
Anyways, we can't shower together because the water i use burns her while i don't even feel it, she can't hold her hand under it while i can easily wash my face, balls, whatever
And the water she uses is ice cold to me while it's lukewarm for her
I'm also constantly cold, i'm walking around the house closing windows she opened while she's in her t-shirt
I guess it highly depends from person to person
Thanks, i wanna visit portugal as well, never been there but i heard only the best
This is one of the best things about croatia and one of the reasons i'm not moving anytime soon
We have sun and we have mountains just an hour away, we have 3 different climates, depending on what you prefer
Life is pretty good, except for the obvious problems like people, government and shit like that
well, if someone's favourite day is a random day without a wind then you gotta take the wind seriously
yeah, i fucking hate the wind as well
but, on the other hand, the plan is to visit island next spring, we gonna go camping around your little island
we heard the spring time is the best time
It's not crazy, croatia truly is one of the most amazing countries in the world, regarding geography
As i said, that's one of the main reasons i'm staying here and now, since we're in the EU more and more people are coming from abroad which i really like
Or maybe its all the oil in norway's case
In that case i wouldnt have to move then
Not these fuckers that keep commenting how they like the dark and cold winters
But good riddance, i say, it would be a country of normal people :D
>What did happen ? Were they too obnoxious ?
Well, some are but that's just normal, everyone has obnoxious tourists
Sorry man, i really don't want to bash italians, i'm just saying that you are a bit too loud for me
Everyone's shouting all the time
>I think the general perception about this theme is screwed, Italy (including the south) has a low [murder rate] (0,67 over 100
000 inhabitants) even lower than Croatia (1,10)
Hmmm, what would be the murder rate for just the south
I keep reeding about these vespa executions where innocent get killed as well but you know better than me, for sure
I've been to italy plenty of times, things dont change
But either way, i'm not bashing them, they are loud and thats a fact
Nothing wrong with it, it's just that i can't stand it
There are plenty of people who dont mind loud talking
We're limited with our vacation days during the summer and those that we get we spend on relaxing by the sea
Travelling is for the off season
Regarding the 24 hour day, no problem for me since i'm used to going to sleep after the sunrise
Not because i'm partying like crazy but because i used to spend too much time on my computer
last trip was to scotland so we can deal with cold and rainy
i'm really looking forward to it, i heard all the best
I was in the English CS:GO voice chat and I spoke Croatian language as I was talking with my brother and no one else and they were making fun of our language saying stuff like: "their language is stupid" or "I would kill myself if I spoke their language" me and my brother just stopped and said "we also speak English you idiots" at the same time
They immediately disconnected
Similar story happened to me, but much worse and a little less likely to happen considering there aren't many people from Croatia elsewhere (ok except Germany)
I was in Verona in a McDonalds waiting for the cashier to put the food on my tray and I noticed he didn't put a straw on it, so I, unaware that the straw dispenser is right next to me, arrogantly said in Croatian "For fuck's sake you could've at least given me a fucking straw" to which he replied "They're right here dumbass" in Croatian as well
We laughed it off in the end
Every time I travel somewhere I stumble upon Croatians in most random situations
Just last month I was visiting Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, waiting forever to use a bathroom, and whispered more for myself in frustration "o jebemte živote, oće li to više..." ("Oh fuck my life, what's taking so long", kind of) and guy in front of me turned around and replied "ne govori mi ništa, usrat ću se
" ("Tell me about it, Im gonna shit myself
We have that saying here too and you can hear it all the time
You are right, but still I mean a McDonalds worker in Verona
out of everybody I interacted with there, this was the only time I was a little aggressive and it turned out to be someone from the same city as me
Hahahaha takvi trenutci su najbolji
I mean that's true but there were 5 of us in a team and three of us were Croatian and it was quicker to talk to each other like that
Yes, absolutely
We use mostly Italian and German ones
Italian on the coast and German probably inland
So In Croatia most people play Tressette and Briscola (Italian cards) in the south and Belot in the north
Spanish not that much
Here in Croatia, on the coast, we play with italian cards, and they are very similar to spanish
Briškula and Trešeta are the games
In the continental part, people play with hungarian playing cards
Game is called Bela
I've seen these before in Croatia, but rarely
Us southern Croatians use the Italian deck 99% of the time to play Italian card games, such as the briscola (briškula) and tressette (trešete)
I haven't heard of it at all
The most used deck here is probably the German deck
Never heard of it in this form
They look similar to  what we would call italian cards, but they all have the same design different from this
Generally we have standard french deck, italian [triestine] decks are popular in the coast while so called [hungarian] is used in the inland
In Istria and north east Italy we call them Triestine, and are used to play briškula and trešete (both game names are from italian)
We adopted the Italian version with Italian names (Tristine version is the most popular here)
Its mostly popular on the coast while most people in the central Croatia never heard of it
and in coastal croatia
This German deck is used heavily in the northern and north-eastern parts of Croatia, in order to play "Bela".
I'm pretty sure on the coast we use Italian more for Briškule and Trešete
I wouldn't even give them the option of a test because they still might pass it
Just don't let them renew licences after they hit 65 or so and give them free public transit
Or give them one of those self driving cars
at 13 C I'll wear a thin jacket
at 8 C it's a regular jacket and a hat
5 C and under is a winter jacket, gloves, hat, extra leggings under jeans and boots
Anything colder than 20 is already too cold
But if I had to specify a temperature at which I become really agitated, it's around 10
Are you my long lost brother
I have a couple of friends from subtropical/tropical countries and my envy is immeasurable
There's no greater hassle than putting on half of your closet and leaving your apartment in the morning when it's rainy, cold and still dark
On the other hand, warm weather has never been a problem for me
I don't really think words, rather I see a map of europe
Well that escalated quickly
Life is boring and I used to be unemployed for 3 months even tho my mom and sad took care of me and I had video games and went to lakes with them it was boring
Life is more intresting when you have something to fuck you like a work but with money that I would win I would take brakes from work when ever I wanted
Not just post-soviet and post-warsaw pact, its a thing across most of Ex-Yugoslavia
Our "nation-forming" party, HDZ, was and still is full of ex-Communist Party of Yugoslavia members
Same goes for SDP - social democrats, but its all being replaced by younger people
Especially left/center smaller parties that got some seats in the parliament during these elections
I would say its about 30%. Its been declining, but i feel like quite a lot of young people of both sexes smoke nowadays while before it was mostly men
Well a bunch of my friends smoke(I don't) and a lot of people in general
Not just cigarettes but also weed here and there
Kids can go buy cigarettes in stores easily, noone will do anything about it
Society does not force people to smoke tho we just have easy access so a lot of people smoke
I went to buy cigarette paper once I was 14(for other purposes) and noone asked a thing
30%? I'd say most people smoke
"Croatia
Isn't that, like, in yugoslavia
No, Yugoslavia broke apart almost 30 years ago
We fought bloody for our independence and it's annoying how uneducated you are about the country you're visiting, especially if it's in the Balkans
Saying Tesla is *only* Serbian
Equalising Croatian and Serbian language
“You are a Balkan country” will trigger half and half not :)
Heard this about pretty much any Slavic country lol
You here to fill out your daily warcrime quota
Yeah like they are just dialects of it
You make a big fuss about nothing dude
In Croatia we call you "Češka". So, female form of the word
In English it just makes more sense to use the "female" form (even though English has no noun genders)
Hot take they are not
Southeastern Europe is just a new name for the Balkans, which kinda works the same as Eastern Europe in the way its perceived
We have more Serbs than I thought(189k)
And to add to that; a lot of Serbs never say that they are Serbs nowadays; so there's probably more (I mean hey, I'm one lol)
Yeah I knew we had Serbs near me there are a lot of Serbian villages but I never knew that we had 189000 Serbs like where are they
It is also a result feom way back when Bulgars concured Serbia in 10
Century and Croats let them settle in their lands near Knin for safety and some stayed forever
Last time I checked he was from Austria
Mostly around the border with Serbia and in larger cities, such as Zagreb
There some in the area of the former Vojna Krajina (Banija, Kordun,Lika etc
) too, but not nearly as much as before the war
I wrote a longer comment on a similair question on AskBalkans that explains why a bit more, but the short of it yes, and I've seen other Serbs being treated differently, I know a guy who gets mocked and people didn't want to hang out with him just because of it
Here it is if you wanna read it
While Serbs and Croats are extremely similair (I mean we have the same language) they are two different nations and people
Not in large numbers, no
Most Serbs came here during the Ottoman conquests and became border guards
Well, the vast majority of Serbs did come to Croatia in the 15th century and later
Da granica sa Srbijom i Baranja, zapadna Slavonija i Banija, Kordun i Lika, ali u Lici,Baniji i Kordunu živi jako malo ljudi
Najvjerojatnije je većina pomijesana u vecim gradovima
Exactly
The young people don't really care nor some of the elderly people example are concerts, Croatians love Serbian bands and vice versa so you can see Croats, Bosnians and Serbs enjoying music together on concerts
Serbs also go to Croatia for a vacation and Croats near the border go to Serbia to enjoy low prices and cheap shoes
But mostly people who fought in the war and had trauma and their kids have issues with going to Serbia and just the name Serbia
But Croats generally have issues with Serbs mostly because all of the dead and lost people during the war who ended up in Serbia and were never given back to their families, Serbia still denies that
Also the town of Vukovar which looked like a post-apocalyptic town  after the war and all the Serbs and Croats together sharing the same town
It is like the person who killed your parents and raped your sister was in front of you in the line in the grocery store and you have no right nor proof to do the same back
It is true what you are saying but some Serbs migrated to Croatia from the fear of the Bulgars too
But they were always there since the beginning of south slavic history and so were the Croats in Vojvodina
Hvala puno :)
S obzirom da mi stara to ne radi, ne
Ali hvala ti, i vjeruj mi, jesam ponosna :)
Well
yeah
Well if you know Cyrillic I recommend Cyrillic because more slavs use Cyrillic but Serbian Cyrillic has the same sounds as Croatian Latin so for serbo-croatian it is the same but in Serbia and Bosnia they use both while in Croatia only the Latin
Maybe, it is probably just personal opinion but Russian Cyrillic is different from the Serbian one
Croatia-pools 0
Its against the rules
Beaches 10% tops, but probably closer to 5%
Maybe 1-3%. Can be more or less depending on the beach
Was far more common 15-20+ years ago
I'd go for less than 5% as I can't remember when I last saw a woman sunbathe topless
Indeed stupidly false, I wish it was 50% though
Finally someone realistic
I'd say even less than that
No way it's 15% here
Less than 1 imo
Yup, it looks like I am underpaid as well
And I work a normal job, a good job
damn
Guess me and the boss need to have a talk
Haha
Edit: I live and work in Germany
Googling them and then liking all of their photos in a swim suit on instagram and facebook would truly be a real power move
Bonus points if its after midnight
Since no Croatians here, let me introduce Zagreb's ~~mayor~~ lifelong dictator [Milan Bandic]
Croatia
Croatia Speaking
Cmon bro, Ingrid Antičević Marinović: [
&#x200B;
PIPL MAST TRAST AS
Not sure if this was posted in the comments, but [this] made me feel ashamed of coming from a country that allowed her to represent us in the EU parliament
There are more examples, but this has to be the worst
Day after yesterday is also a clasic
"Because you can be do what we want to do"
Loving the new motto of the EU
Not Greek but I did hear him speaking Ancient Greek tho and a part of me died inside
Still can't believe people consider \*that\* a sign of intelligence/culture
Ingrid's speech may be the most famous, but our former minister of defence Damir Krstičević is also famous for his amazing English skills:
"people must trust us" speech deserves an honourable mention
People must trust us is invincible
Was looking for this
Ustasha regime in WW2
It wasn't a Belgian colony it was Leopold's personal property
Well it did become a Belgian colony later but Belgian government annexed it specifically to end Leopold's atrocities, Belgium didn't do shit
I honestly find it kinda pathetic how countries that were nutral in WW2 like Sweden and Switzerland now have this charade of *"oh we're so terrible for staying out of the war and not actively fighting Nazis"*
As if you ever stood a chance, all you would've achieved is direct Nazi occupation and even more direct enforcement of their rule
You choose the least bad option
There are at least 2
I know a number of Nazi officials did criticise Ustashe for their brutality consequently doing opposite of what they were intended to (pacify the region)
And yes, they were brutal to say the least
Now I wonder what they originally wrote
That had to do more with the wish to destabilise the Ustashe state (split between German and Italian occupation zones), exert more influence and to gain help in fighting Tito's resistance
Those rebels, Chetniks, exercised similiarly brutal reprisals on Croatian population (even though in that area Croats were mostly anti-Axis) so Italian support for them didn't exactly come from the goodness of their hearts
They were Emu collaborators
No mercy for them
Definitely the Ustasha regime in World War II
Jasenovac camps in ww2, under the Ustaša regime
Being in Personal union with Hungary
I'd agree with you if you could prove they established legitimate country with popular support, not a mere puppet state
>Something awful along the same lines **would have happened** in 20th century Europe
Historical determinism is BS
Nothing in history was inevitable
Was there a high chance of a highly nationalist government rising in Germany
Yeah
Was it inevitable that they'd commit the biggest genocide in human history
In some Croatian places, after a funeral there is a big meal for the friends and family (sort of like a wake but post-funeral I guess)
On the head of the main table there is a place reserved for the deceised, with a plate and a glass turned upside down to signify they are no longer there
Turnes out, the Phoenecians used to do exactly the same thing, so it is a 3000-4000 yr old tradition
I don't personaly practice this but lots of people still practice the ancient balkan tradition of hating all of our neighboring countries
Yes, there's this guy who was born like 2000 years ago
Nobody knows when actually but we're all celebrating his imaginary birthday which was a pagan celebration to begin with
And if you think this is crazy wait till you hear how we celebrate his death and that special time when he left a cave 3 days later
Yeah, shit's crazy with your slava
So let me get this straight because i never understood it properly:
The oldest son takes over his father's slava when he dies, but until then he doesn't have one even if he has his own family
What happens to younger sons
Do they choose their own saint and date
What if you're a younger son who married an only daughter, do you take your father in law's slava since nobody's there to inherit his
I feel like this is a game of ping pong with saints
You get a saint, you get a saint, everybody gets a saint
No way
REALLY
Oh, you haven't heard of whats-his-name, our lord and savior
Lol, look, a polish person complaining about the lack of vowels
Jokes aside, in croatian (we also say smrt) r can transform into a vowel when needed, just like the letter y in the english alphabet
Wasn't us southerners for sure, it's smrt here as well :D
Ok, al to znaci da braca nece skupa slavit slavu kad su svi u svojim kucama, svak slavi svoju, ili
Da, da, kuzim taj dio
Ali evo, imas tri sina, sva 3 se isele i ozene, sva 3 preuzmu slavu na sebe i niti jedan od te 3 ne dodje tebi, njihovom tati, na slavu jer sva trojica organiziraju slavu doma
Kuzis
A Croatian guy who doesn't smoke, is not going out to cafe with his friends and doesn't care about football at all
A Croatian that doesn't complain
A Croatian who doesn't like football
Or says burek wit cheese
What does it mean
same with balkans
Same thing with me, I'm from croatia
I don't.
I would say so
I would say slightly less prevelant
Yes, I am 16
No, not at all
Few months ago I saw a girl from my high school which took money from the ATM and I was shocked and confused
But I payed a couple of times with my dad's debit card
I dont have a job, I am in school
No, nobody has time for a part time job, but some have a job for a two months in summer
Around 6 hours in school + travel time which is proximity 1+ hours each day (depending on where you live and what kind of school do you want to go)+ learning, a lot of learning, especially if you go to the gymnasium
I had a friend who travelled around 2 hours just in one direction to school
He transfered to closer high school because he didnt have time to learn
Yes
Do you even sleep then
Because my friends dont even have time for home work sometimes
croatian
sunce (the sun) is neuter, but iirc the modern word is a diminutive of the originally feminine one
mjesec (moon and month) is male, though
I'd say the golden age is the present for Romania
>Most people worked 7 to 5,
What great working conditions
I was being sarcastic
That's 10 hours
That's insane
Who works more than 8 hours a day regularly
Koji kurac
Odvratno
wait, none of you could swim and you went on a dinghy in the deep
man, sorry, but you really fit the polish/czech stereotype people in croatia have :D
Are you thinking of a hedgehog
Because there are no porcupines in Croatia
oh shit, is it the Vandersexxx
yeah, we have scorpions everywhere down here
you get used to them but i still kill them when i see them
sorry scorpions :(
I dont think you can get stoned by eating fresh marihuana leaves so maybe the sheep were just being dicks
Continental Croatia as a whole
Most cities are hundreds of years old and have old cores, with enough investment each could be mini Prague or mini Budapest
But all money is invested in coast and capital
It's sad really
Well pretty much all of eastern Croatia(Slavonia) has amaizing food, culture and overall awesome people who apsolutely appreciate tourists because they don't come much
I reccomend the Baranya region to check out, mountains in Slavonia(there is a UNESCO Geopark there) and cities like Osijek, Požega, Đakovo, Vinkovci and Vukovar especially for those war stories there
Osijek and basically whole Slavonija region
Honestly, the tourists are missing out
German i would say at least here because a lot of people go work in Germany . But other than that maybe Russian for eastern Europe
Serbian becouse the whole world is Serbia
But if you're looking for a serious answer probably French or German or Spanish
Where are these types of Germans, because working in IT for an American company that has subsidiaries all over the world the only other language used in company wide emails and documents is German
You think Poland will take over Germany in importance
Poland has neutral growth so no, that isn't going to happen
Not to mention that Poland's economy isn't growing at some astronomical rate that would make them the biggest economy in 30 years
They're doing
Fine
it would be haram to deprive yourself of rakija
Wow, didnt know that, very cool
Ive never met a Kartvelian before
How is your country doing
Ohh man, A je to and Krtek was the shit
Pretentious nerds: (eagerly awaiting to blurt out Fenno-Scandia)
You would not be a good parent if you didnt let your children watch the hood classics
I feel you, Im also a nerd
But Ive realised its very annoying if I do that around non geography nerds so
Tito or Pavelić
Depends on where you stand
Charles II on the other hand
I hate equally Pavelic and [Borna, Duke of Dalamtia
That fucker sided with Franks against Ljudevit, Duke of Pannonian Croatia, and I’m still salty about it
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Cut him some slack, the guy lived in the time which we don't even understand
We don't even know how both sides saw each other
Some do
Extreme leftists and those who directly benefited from his reign do
The rest don't.
I'm not here for your self righteous lectures,you know nothing about my nations history which makes anything you say invalid
You are saying that as if he was not the greatest Spanish monarch
That’s a very reasonable point to make, but I’m just a human
And historian
We’re the worst
We hold grudges for centuries, nah millennium
Fucker
I know a number of people of moderate opinions who like Tito
Not to the point of adoring him, but thinking his positives overule his negatives
He is directly responsible for deaths of hundreds of thousands of POW and civilians
He would have been held responsible for war crimes under a fair trial
Now you know this guy is not sane
Any sane Croat hates Pavelic
And we are big majority
Trust me
But, on other hand, it does not mean we like Tito
We don’t hate him particularly, I mean there’s many, many others in our history we could hate more, but in the end he was a dictator and we are not crazy about Yugoslavia now because of recent history
Older people like him more, younger don’t.
I hate Tudjman too
I think he was an asshole and that we would fared much better with someone else as president, me preferring Gotovac, but that’s what would be if
Well, yes whatever the number was
I don't know why you are telling me this, I am just talking about my experience
Depending which dialect you can probably learn Croatian proper but then you might come to the northwest Croatian mountains(Hrvatsko Zagorje) and hear a total different language that even Croats can't understand or you might go to Slavonia or Dalmatia and hear an absolutely different accent and new words which aren't used in Croatian proper so every part of Croatia is different especially the northwest, North(međimurje), northeast, Istria and of course eastern Lika, Kordun and eastern Slavonia where they speak Serbian
And if you learn Croatian proper usually we can hear a non-native speaker and also most people actually learn Serbian rather than Croatian because it is a little bit easier
Our language is very regionally fragmented
Not just into the 3 really differing dialects but also on a city to city level
What you might hear and say in Zagreb may not be understood in Pula
Pretty hard, I would say almost impossible for non-Slavs
Especially considering the many regional dialects
Grammar-Its medium
Pronounciation-Very hard
Unless you're from an another ex-Yugo country lol
I live in Germany and I'm having sooo much problems with German as I just moved in last year
I'm level B2-ish as I studied it in school for 9 years, but it feels like I need an MSc to understand someone from Schwaben
I'm pretty jealous of all the Dutch guys who speak better than me, yet only learned German for half the time I have
On the other hand, Croatian is definitely harder to learn for any foreigner than German
There's just too much shit
and even if you do learn it pretty good, chances are you won't understand what I'm even saying
I would say less dialects but als9 because it is a little easier to pronounce like in Croatian you wpuld say rijeka(river) and in Serbian reka also meaning river it is all about the ije and je in words like in Croatian snijeg(snow) in Serbian sneg also meaning snow
More less, the biggest difference is the ije and je thing which happened when the languages were forming and before ije, je and e we just had ѐ which was a sound with all the ije, je and e. And the difference is also with saying the future in Croatian we would say "Moramo ići" (we have to go-verb in infinitive) and in Serbian it would be" moramo da idemo"(we have to go-verb in present with the word "da")
These differences don't make a difference in understanding each other we can understand each other like brother and sister but these are just some bigger diffrences
Hahaha what a coincidence didn't know Russians and Ukranians have a similar thing
I dont really care since i work in stem research so we dont follow 7 day schedule anyway
4 day work week would likely have no impact
Experiments cant be put into timetables, especially for PhD and postdocs who work unpaid overtimes and weekends anyway
Also I feel companies would (justifiably
) Cut salaries by 20% in that case, and that leaves people at worse position tgan now
But if you are an owner of a company, and your workers now work one day less, it means your production dropped by more or less 20%. Do you really expect hourly wages to rise in order to keep monthly total the same with less work days
Would this switch to 4 day work week imply that companies hire more workers, all of which work four days (in overlaping shifts) to keep their 5 day/week levels production or is the "new" day considered weekend and company shouldnt operate if its not necessary
Thanks to Belgium for the saxophone, I play it and I love it
I would like to thank Slovenia for being so small so we can pass it through in only 40 minutes when we go back to Croatia from abroad on vacation
I am trolling
I love our little bro, Slovenia
Thanks Poland for saving Croatia from the Ottomans, if u never saved us Croatia wouldnt exist today
Thanks, we love you too
Funny thing is that Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are only 2 countries I support during European Championships, and Faroe Islands and 2 irelands in qualifications because only you can bring that romantic feeling of sportmanship not only only on the pitch but also on your end of the stadium
I was drinking beer and watching your game against the Spain in 2012
with my friends and we commented that in spite of 3-0 loss your players played like it's 30th min and 1-0 for spain
Not to mention your win over Italy in 2016
good one
You forgot the devil's triangle of europe - croatia, serbia, b&h, montenegro
We understand each other (almost) perfectly
thats my take on polish as well as a croatian
Write it down, reduce all the z, w etc
and think about archaic words and you can get the meaning
Also macedonian and bulgarian are also quite understandable for us
Slovene a little bit less but people from northern regions understand them much better
Also I can understand almost half of eastern slavic languages (russian, ukrainian) while west slavic less
... you forgot the south Slavs
I think we understand eachother the best
Kosovo speaks Albanian so
that one is the black sheep of the family
I must say, as a Croat, it's easier to understand Slovaks than Czechs
And can't say those two languages sound the same
Same
I am Croat amd can also understand more Slovak than Czech
I don't know exactly why, but it sounds clearer I guess
Now daily almost becuse of buying new planes but usually not so much
Football > Life
Identity
Yes, it exists
We all have multiple identities
I'm a citizen of my country, of EU, of Europe, of my region, of my city, and even the city district I grew up in left some part in my overall identity
And this is just geographic
We also have other identities - our family, linguistical, religious, professional, our hobbies and interests etc
Being defined by solely one thing would strike me as overly simple, and for me being European is a part of who I am
EU overall is already an economical superpower
And we're already semi-federal in many ways
EU as a state, perhaps and I hope so - we'll be stronger together
As a nation, no, not really
However, a state doesn't need to be a "nation state" necessarily
I wouldn't call us overrated, but still
It's just a coastline with cheap local prices
I don't get how we got 21 million visits last year
From my point of view, in Croatia it is Plitvice lakes
When I went to Vienna I met up with a friend there that took me to all the non-touristy places around the city and I had a great time but in the end I still had a craving for doing something cliche and touristy so I went to Cafe Sacher
I must say that it's probably overrated, but I had a great time there acting like I was a part of the Austrian Aristocracy in the 19th century
Overpeiced and overcrowded for sure but it was city state that lasted for 500 years during ottoman invasion and still have preserved walls so not overrated
You about to anger some Croatians, including me lmao
It is very overpriced I agree but Dubrovnik definetly has something to stand out for
The other reply said it all, a city state which lasted 500 years and only brought down because of the Habsburgs who used the opportunity to take it after the Napoleonic wars
But there are d3finetly better places too like all the islands thet exist, Lika and Gorski Kotar mountains, Zadar is very nice and Šibemik too
Also the coastline isn't the only part of Croatia if you want better food and wine Slavonia is the way to go
Its true, Italians and Brits, but the main difference is that Italian teens can handle alcohol better so the Brits are the worst guests there
From Croatian pow Split is considered full of trash and junkies, rude and uncivilised people, so its not rated at all :)
Well, for foreign tourists it is
Sure, every local tourist was in split once i guess but local tourist prefer smaller and quiet places
>is Balkan
Uhhhhhhh
serbia, kinda complicated but we're working things out :)
Whoever touches our border
or shares the waters with us
or borders the country that borders us
Serbia definitely, we had a war with them in 1991 when we tried to become independent from Yugoslavia
It is always been Serbia and Hungary
Serbia and Croatia alwqys had disputes about Bosnia a stuff
Hungary wanted to control our lands from 1102
We went to war with them during 1848 revolution
And after WW1 it had just been Serbia,in Yugoslavia Serbs were dominant and it always bothered us Croats which resulted in Homeland war in the 90s.
Our relations are getting better but when we play against each other it is like playing a final
its a rivalry triangle
More is not required friend
can confirm
[Us]
Ya, and there are few other sayings/names for them as well,  but it's all in light-hearted spirit
not a polygon but a clusterfuck
business
Dominium maris baltici when
Samobor here, 15km away from Zagreb
It woke me up
It felt like someone was shuffling my bed in the room
No damage or wounded here
It felt like someone is shaking my bed really hard
My TV an PS4 fell from the shelf and are wrecked :( My gf jumped out of bed in 1 second
I froze
Biggest shock you can feel I think
I live on the 6th floor
This was the first big earthquake I felt in my life
I almost shit myself
People rushed out of the building
We stayed in the cars for a while
I went to check on my grandpa but he was fine
Anyways, that was NOT a good way to start the day
I reside close to the center of Zagreb in an old building waiting to be destroyed by an earthquake, so I felt it pretty strongly (once I woke up of course)
Not a good feeling to be woken up on a Sunday at 6:20am by glass shatering and facades falling apart
Also now I have at least 1 crack in every room and it's ugly as shit
One 15 year old girl unfortunately died today, very sad :(
i live in zagreb and it woke me up when it started, there is light to medium damage to older buildings, report of kid that died turned out to be false, some churches were damaged so its good thing everyone is isolating, it was not as bad as it could have been
Some buildings were damaged in the town center, top of the church was destroyed and I heard a 15 year old boy died
And didn’t feel it maybe I am strong sleeper I only woke up because my sister screamed
It was very bad
The most scariest thing I felt in my life
I was sure that I'm going to die
Everything is fine at this moment, but my mental state is not
The worst part is that we don't feel safe at home anymore, but we can't go out because of the corona
Many people left Zagreb since this morning so there is a possibility for spreading corona even more
Guess im living under a rock, i live in brela, didn't feel a thing
My uncle lives in a top floor flat in a pretty old building near the center of Zagreb
I called him and he said that he and his dog are fine, but his living room is full of debris, as the roof above it collapsed
My fatrher woke me up shouting that we all have to leave our house
I continued sleeping, we aren't even near the place where earthquake took place, Hungary is closer to the eartquake than I am
I just now saw the videos and reports and it looks kinda bad
My aunt lives in Zagreb and she had to flee the building
I live on the 16th floor
The building was leaning like crazy
Thankfully it was built to counter earthquakes so there is no damage done to it
I just remember waking up to everything shaking pretty badly and thinking it was that damn draft again
i live about 1 to 2 hours away from zagreb, people say shit went wild but i slept through the whole thing :c
Its gonna be snowing in a few days too
I am in Dalmatia and I slept like a baby
Thats odd since we in Dalmatia havent felt anything
>15 year old boy died
She* is still fighting for her life
But she is the only victim as long as I can tell
Earthquakes, virus, red water, meteors
What's next, frogs
Locusts
The Angel of Death taking firstborns
Fucking biblical, mate
The fourth being hladan beton
Yeah we know the epicenter was in Zagreb
It might be
But its more likely because Austrian border and Slovenian towns are closer to Zagreb then Split is to Zagreb
I agree with the party places, don't see the appeal at all
Same with beachy, sunny, hot places like Maldives, Fiji, Hawaii etc
Vast majority of USA seems rather boring
Again hot places like Dubai, India and such
I see zero appeal in deserts and heat, generally, I don't get the popularity
I prefer older, historical places, small towns, I'm really glad I live in Europe, so most interesting places are close
Buildings, architecture, etc
I don’t see the appeal to them
I love beaches, nature
Slovenian "Zahod" (meaning west) means toilet in Croatian
As in Croatian
Sure, with a decent wage life is pretty damn good here
I am definitely moving after college
I don't like it here because of a mentality
I'm not saying all people have this "balkan mentality" but there is a lot of people like that
Also, politicians are corrupt, we can't change anything because of the parliamentarian type of government without a straight up massive riot
There's 2 corrupt big parties and everyone votes for them and I'm sick and tired it
You can always come to Croatia which is basically a Czech exclave during summer :)
hearing Germans about visiting Poland and France is always mixed bag :D
I visited Corse 2 years ago in november and it was super empty, only locals chilling in cafes
Bonifacio is indeed very beautiful
hahaha or that commercial for a car "from Berlin to Warsaw on one tank"
Not me but my mom fled from Bosina durning war and she never went back
There was this thing in the balkans during the 90s and shit got rough in sarajevo so my dad packed us up and gtfo
Haven't regretted it one bit
Don't know any for taking a shit but for taking a pee we say *Idem kokotu pustiti krv* - I'll go spill the rooster's blood
It was wildly popular across exYU too
Newer models could be occasionally spotted, but not nearly as often
Used to be common here in 80s/90s, started dissapearing afterwards, except the Niva, I still see those and I don't even live in a rural area
The new Lada models are looking good though, if they sold those new Niva Urbans here I would be interested
In Zagreb its a 50/50ifhe will let you pass orjust go his way
Pssst, hey
You want some catholic approved rakija
Just your classic Baba Roga (Grandma with horns ^sounds ^way ^better ^than ^horny ^grandma )
She eats children and lives in the woods
>Putin still does karate, plays hockey
I see you're still exposed to quality free media there in Serbia
It's always good to know what's Putin up to in his free time
>stop making it be a media thing
As if you would take an interest if you weren't exposed to that bs
Actually I've seen it myself
I live in croatia, one of the smallest european countries and 30 minute up to 1 hour drive to work is pretty normal
It takes me 20 minutes but then again i drive in the opposite direction of the biggest traffic jams
People going to the city centre will spend a lot more time for shorter distanced than my route
That being said, what we usually dont do is drive extra long distances to work, we usually prefer just to move closer
Lets say the normal limit is 50ish km, everything above that is rare
I don't exactly 'fit in' and in some regards I'm unusual for my country, also I couldn't care less about Croatian subreddit, sometimes I check it out when I wanna feel annoyed and disappointed lol
I feel stereotypical in some ways and the opposite in others and the same would be the case in pretty much any other country
But I 100% feel like I belong in this part of the world, especially coastal part of the country
I always felt Slavic+Mediterranean in my soul, for example I can't imagine myself being a Dutch girl
It depends, regionally, where I live (Dalmatia, Croatia) people (men) drink wine after lunch
be it one glass or one liter, then they have a nap for hour or two and then drink some more,  Some older people drink hard liquor (rakija) before breakfast because it is good for metabolism
Theres also quite distinction between alcoholics and before mentioned healthy life style
but lines can be blurred depending
of maybe weather
lol
I dont think that theres big difference between young people indulging in alcohol anywhere
But after three in the morning you can see, stuff
and its not just alcohol, everything goes
Sex drugs and whatever mindfuck music is playing in the club
But no matter what younguns are expected to be present on  family lunch
Also older men drink more wine, maybe beer and women hard liquor, (in secret)
in every house that you come like guest no matter time you'll be offered alcohol and food
Here alcohol is lifestyle
Also its not unusual to see people early day drinking beer (it counts as breakfast) while working some hard job
Especially in hot weather
What I see difference in young people that we(?!) don't do shots, it is mostly relaxed, wine and beer, but after three anything goes
Pretty much as you said
Only "acceptable" among highschool/early college  activity
You can do it later but only like once a year
Going out drinking when adult should end with you still being mostly coherent
I must share my grand grandmother  daily routine, and she lived hundred years
And was matriarch
Wake up, shot of Moonshine, than raw egg
Breakfast, old bread and milk, and maybe wine
(yes old people here mix wine with milk; when I was like three I liked it very much)
Than is time for, lunch, something light, mostly fish
than glass or two wine mixed with water
Than siesta
Light supper followed with glass or two of wine mixed with water
When she felt under the weather there was only one medicine, You guessed it, moonshine (rakija)
She died of old age, 100 year old
her last supper we brought her goat cheese and wine with water, she said Give me whole wine
Legend
you typed h insted of j my guy
Considering how active those people are, I'm surprised we don't have any big ones here
Every year before Christmas, there's a group of these anti abortion morons 24/7, praying and holding billboards along one of the entrances to a hospital near where I live
Yes, and the holy spirit will be watching
Macedonian is like 90% intelligible for me
Slovenian is closer to 70%. I have a really hard time with spoken Bulgarian but written is pretty inteligible
I also find West Slavic languages ewsier to understand than East Slavic languages, Czech and Slovak more than Polish
Well we slavs understand each other very much but which one is easier to read than listen to
So all the south slavic languages except for Slovenian are easy to listen to and easy to read
Slovenian I think is much more easier to read but depends where are you from
Northern Croats have a very Slovenian style dialect
West slavic languages are definetly easier to read than to listen maybe as an exception for northern Croats
East slavic languages are I think easier for us to understand tho at least for me
Ukranian is pretty easy along with Russian and Belarusian I would rather read
I feel like italian would fit for many people on the coast
I can read italian quite fine and understand spoken (at least when not spoken too fast)
But i just dont have the vocabulary to say more than a few phrases
>(I should add that even some Danish people can’t tell written Danish and Norwegian apart, instead thinking it is just Danish with some grammar mistakes or typos
LOL That's the case with Serbian and Croatian
I get "corrected" for the writing on serbian sites all the time in order for them to find out later that it was just Croatian all along and we have a bit of a different grammar
Being poor and complaining rather than trying to change anything
I guess drinking for all of the Balkans but for Croatia it is name days whom are already mentioned and maybe our style of eating, we usually eat bread with everything and always have soups before the main meals
Also our cuisine is special as in all of Balkans but I think sarma and peka style cooking will always stay
Oh my god Switzerland sounds like a paradise
Same experience here
I live in Germany and the local Bäckerei Haferkamp which seems to have a monopoly there is shit and super expensive
Yes, there are some local bakeries although very few - for instance on my way to work I have 1 local bakery and 4-5 Haferkamp's. I  haven't had too much time to explore as I've only been living there for a year or so, but from what I tried the local ones are quite good, but they are just not as easily accessible if you don't live close to one
Zagreb has a similar fate to Bremen
There are multiple big bakery companies that are thankfully very cheap, but unfortunately their bread is equally shit
I don't want to sound picky as I'm usually not, but if there's anything that I didn't like back home then it was the bread
Fortunately in the last couple of years we've had a couple of really good small bakery businesses open up close to the center of Zagreb, so now that I'm home I can finally enjoy some good family backed bread
I guess people here mostly eat normal white bread as it's the cheapest and most versatile, but you can also find ciabatta, baguettes (or any corn flour bread), focaccias (more seldom though) and no yeast bread - usually we would buy it at the Dolac farmers' market on saturday morning for the weekend
ćevapčići. everybody knows that
also, čvarci, pancerota, prikle, off the top of my head
We stole from Bosnia so Čevapi is very much enjoyed here
He's obviously talking about currywurst
I wouldn't say odd, but not a lot of people have it
You won't see flags hanging outside people's homes, and if you do, it's likely a holiday or a football match
Wearinh a hat or a tshirt, or anything else, with the flag is seen as not so sofisticated
Yes
I have lived in Denmark and their flag is everywhere
Supermarkets, schools, streets, people's backyards, on the buildings, windows
etc
I personally loved it
Denmark is a cool country and seeing one more country in Europe, except my own, to be so proud of their flag and nation was quite amazing to me
I am glad I lived in such a country
Wow, that's interesting
I'm in Zagreb, and we don't have them so many here
If somebody has them aside of holidays or football, I'd guess they are conservative or a war veteran
Then again, given Dalmacija is a tourist destination, maybe they're showing off their pride
:D I'd love to hear opinions of Dalmacija natives here
It is only controversial with Serbs
The "checker board" has been Croatian coat of arms since the beginings
There is a theory that when our coat of arms starts with first white field (current one is first red) that is a fascist one cause that is the one used in 1941-1945 by a fascist puppet state of NDH
But, that leaves the question of why did the previous coat of arms start with first white field then
Were our Medieval ancestors  nazis
I am very proud of our country today and to me personally first white or first red does not matter
They are both correct in historical matter
They are both croatian coat of arms and I do not associate either one of them with fascists
Just type in Google "old croatian coat of arms" and you'll see that most if not all of our coat of arms were first white field
Also on the roof of the church of St
Mark in front of our parliment building the coat of arms starts with white field
The coat of arms on our parliment building has first white field
The one from the 1600s has first white, all of the medieval ones have first white
and so on and so on
You tell me now
is there anything controversial about that
Edit: spelling
I think you forget the World Cup
[This photo] went around the world after Croatia beat England and qualified for the World Cup final, a huge sports achievement for a small country like Croatia
The picture is showing Vrsaljko taking a rest on our flag with a serene smile after third extra time in three games
I thought you would pick Willem's portrait  or smt

Nepotism in job industry and overall
You MUST know someone to get a shot at getting a job, going to a doctor any time soon, do any sort of paperwork
The fact that corruption is not only a regular occurence, it is often justified and in some extreme cases, glorified
Cynical would definitely be the right word for it
I also loathe the kind of people, most commonly found in Dalmatia unfortunately, who have this know-it-all attitude
They think they're the smartest, they talk the most and interrupt others, but in reality they're pretty dumb
Of course not many people behave as such, but only one is enough to ruin your day
I... I... I get unlimited data for that price
Oh yeah, that's fucking annoying
I usually tell that type of people "Let's switch jobs for a couple of weeks/months then, see how that works out
I could really use some exercise
I will never understand the mentality of people like that
I disagree with you
Cynical people are mostly more intelligent than non-cynical ones
> I also loathe the kind of people, most commonly found in Dalmatia unfortunately, who have this know-it-all attitude
They think they're the smartest, they talk the most and interrupt others, but in reality they're pretty dumb
Oh God
And then when you disagree with them or tell them why it's wrong they take it as an personal insult
Can you explain what is that
Ireland re-invents word "poor quality" when it comes to Europe
When someone like that gives you an advice which you didn't ask for and then when they found out you did it your way they act like you betrayed them
Familiar
Thank you for explaining it to me
How high is the public support for this
>  It may even illegal by international law, which in contrast to military type services clearly forbid mandatory citizen work
Even if it is, I don't think anyone would abide by it
European history is around 2000 years of "Hey that province is mine"
I think that you are confusing serbian politicians with serbian people
They have strong political strings with Russia but at least from my experience with my neighbours, people dont really care
Especially the young ones
I assume your media, like most medias, are very biased and you think that everyone who is friends with Russia is your enemy
Dont get me wrong, I feel more connected to Ukraine then Russia and I am really sorry for the things that are happening in your country, but Serbian people in general are not like you portreyed them to be
"lakat" (elbow) is used specifically in my home town and is 51
2 cm long
in the middle of the old town walls there's a statue depicting the medieval knight Orlando with the lakat engeaved at his feet
also while not outdated by sny means, you could say the base measurements in croatian are deciliters (dec) and dekagrams (deka) bc of how much more often they're used in spite of the base units
When buying stuff at the butcher or cold cuts/cheese we usually say the weight in "deka" as well
Jutro means "morning" in Serbian and Croatian
They're 100% related, coming from the same word in Proto-Slavic [*ùtro]
Pantheon, Rome
Alhambra
Gothic cathedrals (not easy to just choose one), prob Chartres
St Peter's basilica and square, Rome
Eiffel tower, Paris
Plitvice lakes, Croatia
Dolomiti, Italy
Fjords (again, which to choose)
and OFC
Lake Bled, Slovenia
It's just a little joke
If I had to choose something from Slovenia though, it would definitely be Škocjan caves
A whole canyon inside a cave is not something you see often
All of them it is
When I was a teen I couldn't stand most of my country's more folky music scene
I don't mean stuff like turbofolk (I still can't stand that), but stuff like dalmatian singers that sang about the sea, pop dancing music and the stuff you'd usually hear at weddings or big parties
Today I can't properly work or study without a dalmatian klapa or a Croatian pop playlist blasting my ears with pure bliss
I don't know if it's generally pleasing melodies, meaningful and catchy lyrics, or just hearing a beautiful harmony of a klapa, but I did a complete 180 on that subject
Totally the same
I used to hate our music and especially dalmatian klapa, but now it reminds me so much of summer and being home
It always puts me in a good mood when I listen to it
I would love if the bulgatian restaurant chain "Happy" came to Croatia
The food is fantastic (as well as everything I tried in Bulgaria), and you get the food very fast
Think McDonalds speed but homecooked quality dishes
The greek goody's. It is a very nice fast food restaurant with burgers
I used to like KFC as a kid, but nowdays they suck
Boy oh boy here we go:
Roman empire ( including later Byzantium ), we even had a few emperors from Croatia
Later we got into a personal union and got fucked by Hungary, mostly later on though
Then we got into an even bigger country and continued to get fucked by the Austrians
Then we got fucked in the 1st Yugoslavia, like a huge amount of state funds just went to Serbia and the eastern parts
Then uhm, the 90-ies were interesting to say the least, so Serbia as no
5 probably
Note: I don't hold any grudges against nations from this list that still exist, I believe Croatia has like pretty good relations with most of our neighbours
We learn more about the Habsburg Monarchy than we do about Hungary, but we definitely learn more about Hungary then we do about Austria
Thing is, Austria gets used as a synonym for the various forms the Habsburg imperial constructs took over time, so that's why people think of "Austria" when they think of "number of times thing is mentioned in history class". But realistically, we learn very little about Austria proper, instead focusing on the Habsburgs themselves, and the deep effect that being part of their holdings had on us
It depends on the professor tho
I remember that mine was crazily obsessed with Arpad Dynasty (We call them Arpadović lol), so much so that she would ask us in exams In which Croatian monastery did King Bella IV hid his royal treasures
I still don't know the answer to that question
I feel like that's not really true
We learn a whole lot about Hungary in the Habsburg monarchy
Ban Josip Jelačić, 1848
revolution, Croatian-Hungarian settlement of 1868
and Riječka krpica ("fiume blanket"), relations of Mađaroni (pro-Hungarian unionists) and Narodnjaci/Ilirci, later on the "new course" movement of 1903
/1905
, where the Croato-Serbian coalition allied with Hungarians against Habsburgs
Austria is mostly there through the relations of Croatian politicians with the Habsburg dynasty, and their constant blocking of unification of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia
I remember, when I was in school, I didn't really enjoy history (that changed later), and as a Dalmatian I kind of found it boring that I had to learn so much about relations with Hungary and Hungarians, when they were so far away and abstract for me :)
French influence in Balkans goes deep
In Croatia we have a saying that France did more for Croatia in its 5 years of rule than Austria did in its 500 years of rule
All of nationalism that happened in early and mid 19th century, all across Balkans was due to France
It helped Serbia to gain more independence from ottomans and Croatia to get more independence from Hungary and Austria
Also we are thought in school that Napoleon said "give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world" but as far as I know the evidence for that is flimsy and sources are questionable
Furthermore [Jean-michel Nicolier] is probably the most famous modern day Frenchman in here
Some of our most famous generals during Yugoslav wars trained at French foreign legion so there is that
I wouldn't go to much in the details about the Yugoslav wars since the wounds are still pretty fresh and any discussion on that will turn into a shitshow of nationalism which is something I wouldn't want
I just wanted to to point out how France is integral in Croatian nation building and nothing more
If you didn't beat us in Football in '98 and 2018 we would probably be really hard Francophiles
Also our handball teams faced each other so many times at the highest stages that we developed a sporting rivalry with you
There are many many more instances of French influence going back to freaking Charlemagne but my post is getting pretty long so I got to draw a line somewhere
Well my zero evidence theory is that he really liked his hussar battalions
Poland and Balkans had the longest tradition of hussars in Europe so I can see Napoleon saying something like give me 100000 hussars and I will conquer the world, which in the near future became a quote that ran throughout eastern Europe during Spring of Nations as a way to build up national pride
I mean Magyar hussars are kind of a no brainer, but I was trying to connect the dots on that Napoleon quote
I believe due to housing shortages in cities all over the continent there will be a trend of migration back to rural ares, which will (let's hope) also provoke a need for better railway infrastructure and connections
Honestly, it may be peaceful now, but I have a bad feeling Europe will go for round 3 of "World War".
Resources on Earth are getting exhausted every day, and it's only a matter of time before some conflicts start, we can only hope we will find alternative solutions
It's 2 extremes
Either "mega prosperity federal EU land" or "Oh shit the EU collapsed and now everything is going to shit and oh god there is russia and there is hunagry oh fuck were all gonna die"
Exactly, my city was hit by earthquake in second week of lockdown, which frightened a lot of people so many (who have weekend houses or family willing to accomodate them) simply moved for a few months, and it made amazing difference for the city (especially in regards to traffic)
Neki tvrde da se to ne može, ja vam tvrdim da se to može!
Moomins and spurdo are ebin :DDDDD
EDIT: Fixed the end
It might seem stupid, slavic countries all around
Buy I bet most people would choose Austria
Yes, they ruled over us, but they were good to us
And they remembered when Yugoslavia was falling apart
As much as some nationalists would hate to admit it, it's either Bosnia or Serbia
Same language, pretty much the same culture (there are differences, but they're more on a regional level, rather than on a national one), a lot of shared history
Now, it's true the politicians like to stir up shit, and the 90s were a bad period, but the connections between our countries remain strong and if a Bosnian, Croat and Serb met somewhere in Western Europe, it's much more likely they would befriend each other than people of other nationalities, and help out each other
Yes same here
Well we in Croatia always great Ukranians with specialty since you come and work here and we immigrated from west Ukraine /south Poland and the White Croats(ones who didn't migrate and stayed) are now assimilated in Ukranian culture
Supposedly we also have the same folk songs(same melodies and probably words) at least that is what my history teacher told us and generally our history is common so I completely understand Ukranian struggles
Maybe we are not politically as close, but you will always have respect from Croats
You'd be surprised how much croatians want to consider themselves close to Italy
When i was in elementary school our geography teacher even taught us that we share a maritime border with Italy but still a border
The people in western and southern Croatia feel the closeness better than the rest of us especially the istriots
The thing is
Whether you see it or not, Croatia is your brotherly nation
We share a lot
History, cousine, coast(*cough, cough*), culture, we are both Slavs
Slovenia is always in Croatian news
First thing out new president did was visit Slovenia
Plus, I was suprised and pleased to hear how many people speak Croatian in Slovenia
I myself have learned a bit of Slovenian just for fun and to get around when visiting
The only issue in this whole relationship is the Slovenia itself
You guys always tend to isolate from everything
You are really good at it too
Maybe that's why you don't see it
Eaither way, best regards from Croatia
I'd still say Slovenia is more brotherly than Austria, if only because they're fellow Catholic Slavs who were also under Austrian rule and influence AND the fact that unlike most neighboring states in Europe, we've never had an armed conflict, at worst we bicker about undefined borders and take the piss out of each other online
And as for Austrian rule, we look back at it fondly NOW, back in the day we couldn't wait to break free from it
Well I feel no connection to Austria more Hungary especially here in Slavonia yes they were jack-asses and are sometimes now too but here we have a strong connection with them
I think universally we can all agree BiH is always close to us
Macedonia is also a good friend of ours
Remeber me
That would mean Serbia and Albania are brother countries
Conflict rates drop to zero
I think this is something a lot of people in our countries would agree is true
Ah yes
P I Č K I N    D I M
Serbo-Croatian is the best language in the world when it comes to curse words
True, true
I get that
I'm just saying tjat these days a lot of Croats find you as a really close nation
Vause Bosnia is controversial as only one part of Bosnia is considering us as brothers
the rest not so much
So, the closes thing we got is you
Sure
Like I said, I understand completely
Lately I learned that Austrians see Croatia as a friendly nation and do think of us from time to time (especially in the summer)
Which schocked me cause I thought they don't give a rat's a*s about any of the slavic nations
Hahah
Ha, we almost share word for that in Croatian, "kuverta" meaning "envelope". Is it the same in Spanish
Idk really our flag is pretty neat already tho I would change its proportions to be much longer like the one in Knin(   ) so we have the longest flag and it would be cool anyway
Also tho I like our tricolour maybe just the chequered field like in the Kingdom of Croatia or something similar to the one used in Austria-Hungary but I wouldn't mind staying it this way just a longer flag is what I want
We really missed a chance to modernise and change the flag to something that says we're a young nation, looking forward
Like [THIS] having both the colours AND the chequy
But we went with traditional flag with panslavic colours and coat of arms, which is okay i guess but it has a horrible crown element (literary made up by the first president and flag's designer) above the coat of arms, which is just tragically bad design, neither historical nor modern
Change it to the half is German and the other Croatian
Since we could probably make a country in .
I also prefer your flag with the emblem it just makes it better and more recognisable in the world
A lot of European flags look better with emblems on them, including yours
I definitely associate light green with Slovenia and wondered why you don't have it on your flag
I really like  the german flag where you  put the eagle in the middle, makes it feel more german
Is there a specific reason for wanting a longer flag
[Here's my redesign I would suggest, I think the main issue with our flag is the Dutch tricolor
Also I think the shield should look more like a shield and less like a pineapple
Make a lovley Manx couple :D
Plus, it would take away confusion with the Slovak flag
This is a cool design I like it maybe even more than any flag that we had, but the proportions should be like extra long because it would be awesome having a 20 meter long flag
I see what you did there
The trickster
It's not, no, but it is common for cuildren to financially help their patents due to low pensions
Maybe [Klepetan and Malena]
Eh, I don't know if it counts, but in Croatia the media goes nuts a couple of time per year about some damn stork that flies over and nests with the (supposedly) same female every year
Last year she seems to have cheated on him so he killed all her kids when he came back
Nature is really charming
Absolutely
They are always in the news with coundowns and speculations if he doesn't come back to her on time
Definitely nation's favourite couple
my american friend once said sung croatian sounds a lot like spanish
I've never been more offended
For Croatia it’s Russian with Italian accent according to people I’ve talked to (as an Uber in Croatia) but it might be different for Northern Croats
To me, it sounds like a Scot trying to speak German but he keeps randomly throwing words of Hebrew in
And sometimes Croats call you Psići (mean doggies but sure not derogatory) fot the same reason
lol
Can confirm
Also Serbs have a lot easier distinction between "Č" and "Ć" cause of your harsher pronounciation
While us Croats have a bit more difficulties hearing the difference
To us, everything is pronounced much softer
Russian sounds like it is being rewind backwards
Yes, I know about "hladno piće" ofc :)
Thank you Ireland and Germany for the jobs
Thank you to everybody for still visiting our coast despite the fact we are not "that cheap destination" anymore
Wish you all the best !
What are good neighbors for
I'll see myself out
What are good neighbors for

Haven't heard many compliments on beers from Croatia
I'm glad you like it
U r welcome
Those fishes are ethnic Croats
Well that's an easy way to run away from responsibility
Blame Russia for it
Happy cake day !
Moomin TV show aired here
Really enjoyable even after all these years
There are many good beers in Croatia, but in my opinion, almost all of them are craft beers
Nice, didn't know about that
Yeah, it's a good beer
The company is owned by Heineken Croatia
We didn’t use to do that until a couple of years ago when some random man walked into our house
He claims he rang the bell, but we think he pressed the wrong switch (we have two switches next to the door; one is the bell, the other is the light switch for the light above the door)
So he just walked in, not waiting for anyone to answer
Mum was really freaked out, and we have been locking the door since then
It's normal to lock the door here
I live in a capital, so it's not exactly a matter of knowing all the neighbours
+ that doesn't always help either - I've had a break in once
Only during the night
Also, if I’m alone at home and need to take a shower, for instance, I would lock the door
Otherwise they’re unlocked during the day
locked since theres no huge benifit in leaveing it unlocked and no huge down side to locking it
I lock my house when I leave it and when I go to sleep at night
Otherwise, it's unlocked
I mean i would lock my doors anyway if im going somewhere, even if just for 5 mins
But not if im home
When I watched American shows and movies as a kid and the characters got locked out of their house or car I always found it so confusing lol, I've never had a door like that in my life

Is that normal or something
Holy fuck what have we come to
This is utterly depressing and gross
Freedom of speech is a basic human right and it's protection should be of highest priority
Croatia
I haven't seen it on the big portals front pages
I can't say I open them a lot but this should have been a big story
I don't know how I missed it
The biggest story in Croatia is, as always, a pitiful insult sharing between politicians
Our journalism is sad
Probably FER (Fakultet Elektronike i Racunarstva) basically university of electronics and computer science
Bigger countries, Poland
Just look other countries that size in Europe and how much worldwide known places you can see there
then look at Poland, what a big peace of nothing :(
Smaller countries, Baltic states, seem cold and depressive to me
EDIT:typo
I thought the same before I visited many German cities and states
Now it's my favourite European country
For someone who prefer german lager beers, those Belgian are disgusting, stronger and causes really bad hungover
Waffles are shitty sweets to me as well
sorry Belgium
“Boli me briga” literally means “my concern/care hurts” and it is *only* used sarcastically to denote you really don’t care
Not sure if it fits OP’s question but whatever
Ooh, same in Croatian
Saying something is "sranje" is always a bad thing
3 os seriously
Corrupt is my country’s middle name
Pretty corrupt
In Croatia, there is corruption in every segment of your life
Be it the hospital waiting list, politicians, police, getting a job etc
, whatever you do, you can't run away from this
Bribes, "party jobs", giving jobs to politician's friends and families, stealing money with purposely overpaid stuff wherever you go
This is due to HDZ's fame after winning the Independence War, and SDP's for Yugocentrics
Most people somehow became brainwashed to vote for them (or got a job through them), so they vote for these two constantly, that means there is absolutely no progress
Also, stats say most old people vote for these two corrupt parties
Which is kinda odd
We had a guy run for president who wanted to declare Croatia a corrupt zone and make corruption available to everyone (obviously a joke)
He's still at his stuff
Changing his name to Milan Bandić, Camping outside of Zagrebački Holding and handing out lamb, opening a road (iirc) and even made a reddit account (it's ZelimBitiMilanBandic iirc)
Oh, and if you're wondering, the guy's name is Dario Juričan
But yeah, he's just making fun of corruption otherwise it's obviously a big problem
If you don't have money or know someone (that knows someone), you might as well give up
I really doubt
Hard to believe that anything will change, as a president isn't too rightful, and was a prime minister a few years back, wasn't that great
I guess corruption is built in ourselves, idk
We should change tons of stuff to kill corruption
Too many townships, too many useless workplaces in statehood jobs etc
, if we fix that, maybe a part of corruption could be killed
Oliver Dragojević: Cesarica
I wish you independence to Kosovo, my friend
Jakov Gotovac - opera [Ero s onoga svijeta - What's that shining high in heaven]
Men: Višeslav, Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Zdeslav, Domagoj, Branimir, Muncimir, Domagoj, Tomislav, Krešimir, Miroslav, Mihovil, Stjepan, Svetoslav, Gojislav, Petar, Dmitar Zvonimir
Women: Jelena
Tbf a lot of those are used today as well
Not so sure about women, but men are fine
Even with several different national backgrounds, from germany to italy and hungary to slavic names
We would have:Tomislav,Borna, Trpimir, Držislav, Domagoj, Petar Krešmimir, Dmitar, peobably some others but can't remember and for girls maybe Tuga or Buga would count otherwise I don't know
Clodomir sounds weirdly Slavic
Yeah like the only ones that would earn you some weird looks are Muncimir, Svetoslav, and Gojislav
Rip girls tho
If you go past the Trpimirović's, you get some more names
Also, was Miroslav's wife called Margerita ?
Tuga and Buga don't count do they
Yes
Also, Stjepan’s wife was called Hicela and there is a queen Domaslava mentioned somewhere
They are mythical
But Buga actually is a women's name today
Rare, but it exists
Spongebob has a distinct northern/Zagreb style of speaking, Squidward speaks in a bland standard dialect, and Mr Krabs has an infamous Dalmatian islander accent and vocabulary, that group is most often stereotyped as being greedy in Croatian jokes
I just barely found an old clip, and my bad, Mr Krabs seems to have a Dalmatian *inland* accent, but that trope works as well because it is the home of stereotypical greasy "businessmen", it would be shtokavian although spongebob is definitely kajkavian
Patrick has a normal accent but its just very deep to sound idiotic, and my memory is bad but I think Luna also has a Dalmatian accent
Hard or soft Čokolino
I am in the hard camp, fight me
Is burek only with meat (true answer), or it can be with cheese, spinach, potatoes, apples (they are wrong)
Can you refer to the sea as water
For example hearing someone say "How's the water
/Kakva je voda
I'm going into the water
/Idem u vodu
" while I'm at the beach makes my eyes roll and I wanna punch someone
Aldi Süd has indisputably a better logo
Dense čokolino forever
you mean like č and ć?like doesnt the product packeging litterly say č
10000% biscuits
Ne, nego mislim na gusti ili rijetki Čokolino
Yeah i realised that when I typed it but I posted anyways because in english people can only say it that way (or it's the most common way)
I will try to explain
In Dalmatia, we will never call the sea water when refering to it though we all know that it is tehnically water
To us, we use the word water only to refer to water that you drink and shower in
For example, I would never say "I'm in the water
" when I'm swimming in the sea
I think it's connected with the sea having such a huge importance and impact on our lives
It gives us food, it's our main source of income
Calling it water, kinda diminishes it's importance
People from other parts of Croatia call it water and make me and many other people very annoyed while the think we are irational lol
I hope it's a bit clearer but I know it sound very confusing
a kužin nisan nikad jea čokolino samo san ga vidia u dućan pa san bia zbunjen
People from bigger countries not in Europe always try to compare Croatia to bigger countries they know in Europe because they don't know who/where the fuck we are
"Oh
is that like smaller Russia
"Do you guys canoe everywhere like in Italy
"Is that even a real place
Being known for just one tiny thing:
"Aha game of thrones right
"Oh a friend of a friend went to the beach there
super pretty
And the one that boils my blood the most is being called a third world country
It's never ever meant as just an innocent statement
It's always been some dickhole from the middle of nowhere America who thinks I'm weird and probably poor because I come from a smaller "third world country" and that it explains why I'm so out of touch with "all things America"
I've lived around the world, America is the only place where I've had someone actively try to start shit with me because I'm from a different country (usually gets worse when they find out I'm from a small country)
The first thing that comes to mind is size but also population and maybe territory, but i'm not sure about the last one
And I'll never forget Americans basically accusing me of lying about my language
Yes, it exists and yes, it sounds like that, you don't have to like it
And what do you mean tried to start shit with you
Like, "go back to your country" nonsense or
I would agree with you it's generally not an insult, I wouldn't have an issue with it but the part that bothers me is always what they say around the "third world country" statement
It's always something belittling, or  just insulting as all hell
Luckily I only had to deal with a handful of people like that
Telling me I was wrong about my country, where it was, or what the language was like
Saying stuff like "oh you're really clean for someone from a thrid world country"
And the classic "if you hate America go back to your shithole"  "you sure you aren't illegal
" "Drop the fake American accent you commie bitch" "are you here as a mail order bride or something
" "Must suck to be from a third world country, you must be so poor here"
What's funny about that is that I am actually considerably richer than they are
I just don't prounce around in Gucci so they think I must be poor (even though none of them do that
) And when they find out I'm not it's  "ugh, stupid rich internationals thinking they can pay their way in here"
Just to add this: I don't hate America, nor do I hate Americans
I don't agree with some things going on there, and I was unfortunately living in a very stereotypical conservative town where I was constantly shit on for not being American
But in general I have many friends in the US and I love it there
That's unbelievably ignorant and disrespectful
Honestly, I wouldn't feel comfortable going there as a tourist after hearing so many stories like this, and have such stuff happen to me and many others online
Nadam se da si sad među normalnijim, načitanijim ljudima
F for that one
Good to hear that's not a thing anymore
I hope you find someone who isn't that dense hahaha
The Croatian name for platypus is čudnovati kljunaš, which translates to _strange beaker_.
the only one i can think of is morski pas it means shark but littarly translates to sea dog
It wasn't just luck, you know
Otto von Habsburg settled in the US after France fell, and lobbied vigorously on behalf of Austria with the Allied leaders
He was quite liked by the Americans and by Roosevelt himself especially
The Pelješac bridge has been a legal battle between Croatia and Bosnia for a long time, it's currently being built though
Oh there are plenty of them
Zagreb university hospital, several roads, tunnels & bridges that lead to nowhere (for example Vukelićev most, most preko Drave or Omiš tunnel), Spaladium arena in Split, Sisak sports hall, Slijeme funicular in Zagreb (although it‘s under construction now) and so on
Pelješac bridge is the most famous one I think, but it‘s currently under construction by a Chinese company
Wow, this surprised me, and I see here a few countries don't have ID's. We have them here since I can remember
Since before I existed
:D They really make things easier
When I moved to Denmark for my studies few years ago was the time I realized or rather learned that many european countries do not have IDs or they do but it is definitely not **the** ID card rather something similar like in Denmark's case
It still makes very little sense to me as in Croatia it is mandatory to have one I believe when you turn 16 but, you can get it any time before that (babies can have them)
On the plus side, with them we can travel and live in almost all countires in Europe
Edit: we don't need passoport in Europe when we have ID cards, but need them outside of Europe
Dražica
an old female name
nowadays also means "clit". i stayed in a hotel of the same name
I guess Hermann and Heinrich get a pass
We have that in Serbo-Croatian, it's spelled Svetozar, mostly used by Serbs
Dactyloscopy (fingerprint identification), torpedo,  parachute, thermos bottle
But most known is probably tie
Azithromycin
Or perhaps remesdivir with which COVID-19 is treated nowadays
Torpedo as well
we share a ton of modern electricity with Serbia (Tesla)
Aside from that neckties, fountain pens, torpedos
Didn't Nikola Tesla make the radio
Austria then and austria now are 2 different countries tho
You had a formidable navy back then with my home town as it's main port
Just yesterday we were passing by some old artillery fortifications carved in the rock, right next to the main port entrance, they look awesome
Hmm weren't we also the first ones to quarantine people because of the plague in the 14th century
(In Dubrovnik)  not sure, though
Also a mechanical pen and first solid ink fountain pen - Slavoljub Penkala
MP3 player, Mobile pay for car parking, electric speedometer, dynamo
*Correction*: Fountain pens with **solid ink**. Not **the** fountain pens
What Penkala invented was also the mechanical pen
That was the first one
>Mobile pay for car parking
This was invented by Bandić himself, only to more easily squeeze the last lipa from our pockets
Parachute - 1617, Faust Vrancic, so early 17th c.
Withehaed was financing and working together with Ivan Luppis, so first torpedos were called Luppis-Whitehead
I'll give you fingerprinting, but all of South America has Vucetich's system of fingerprints classification
Glad he did that because Tesla didn't really have a lot money to do his works
He got his credit tho in the end
[Here they are]
To the left of it is the main entrance to Pula port and these bad guys guarded it together with a fortress in the woods which is not visible and overgrown
Here we tend to fix things when they stop working so rebuilding that one will take some years since its still functional
Military owns a huge chunk of that land and they have no interest in tourism, their focus is elsewhere
Altho, there were talks for years about them giving that land to the town so we could actually do something useful with all of that
That "platform" is not a platform, it's an artificial island which is a part of the shipyard uljanik, another big stone which is pulling us down since they're leaking money for years now
Imagine how the town would look without a big ass shipyard and derelict  military instalments in what should be the main tourist hub
Yes glad everyone got their credits in the end that is nice
There should be more cross-states banks
In the US if you're banking with one of the biggest banks, you can can get serviced anywhere in the country
In EU, there are only regional banks in few neighboring countries
Lots of things
Rails, plugs and army equipment are the most important I think
Well, on my uni in medicine field you need certain score that is calculated by the Q and IF of journal you pzblish in
So you could publish five papers in low ranking journals or you could go for one Immunity paper for example
And your mentor/PI is the person deciding that so you know from the start what you are putting yourself into
The cost of life would be better
Because for example, new minimal wage in switzerland will put you in like top 10% earners in most of eastern europe
Well there are still some people who consider themselves as Ustaše(Croatian nazis during ww2 who had a puppet state by the Germans) but generally yes people are called Ustaše as an insult for being too bossy sometimes and komunjara(Commie) is also used as an insult
Well, when you call a Croat "Ustaša" he will probably take it as an insult
If said by a Croat that would most likely be due to recepient's righ-wing views
If said by another ethnicity, the trigger can just as well be that you are a Croat
However, some edge lord teens far right-wingers may not object if they call themselves that (in private, in public not so often)
For most of people, yes
For some it's a mark of pride
There are also contexts in which the word "domobran/domobranski" can be used to denote cowardice, though that's a bit rare
(Domobrani were the regular army of the ww2 nazi puppet state, and were generally considered useless in combat
Though calling someone an Ustaša or a "komunjara" isn't an insult that's used outside of political contexts
You could hear someone being called "udbaš" (Yugoslav secret service member) in various contexts, though
Weren't the domobrani the Yugoslav army and not the puppet state army
No, Domobrani were the regular army of NDH
Ustaše were the (mostly) volunteer party militia
The Yugoslav army came out of the Partisans
There were also Domobrani in Austria-Hungary, those were the Croatian units of the army
Serious Sam - classic 90s FPS, a lot of sequels
SCUM - online zombie survival multiplayer
Doodle Jump - simple phone game
The Talos Principle - this is a real hidden gem from Croteam
When it comes to Croatia I think the biggest well known game within the older generations is Serious Sam and our most prominent "modern"/mobile game is Doodle Jump
At first I just saw "Czech journalist" and "-15 degrees C" and thought, "oh god, another one went to the Tatras in flip-flops
I’ve met 2 or 3 people who watched it, but AFAIK its’s practically unheard of in Croatia
I’ve been a massive fan ever since it came out and wish more people appreciated the masterpiece it is
Thank you Slovenia for not hating us
Fellow Europeans, I want to thank you all for your contributions to each other (and us)
There are many things to be thankful to those further away from us, but I'll stick to neighbours and those who were in contact with us more intensely
I want to thank Italy for their cultural influence on our coastal regions
It played a large role during our national revival in era of national awakenings in form of literary and cultural works
Thanks for the food aswell
I want to thank Austria for great architectural efforts during the monarchies
Their buildings stand to this day as one of finest in Croatia
The imperial court was also the most benevolent of foreign rulers we had, so thanks for that too
Thanks for pushing back Ottomans
We would've had a lot less land if you didn't.
I want to thank Hungary for playing game of thrones with us in the middle ages, it wasn't always pretty, but of all the countries that claimed our territory, you at least had decent claim to it
Thanks for enduring common hardships of the time with us(Mongols, Ottomans, Venice an the like)
Also goulash
I want to thank Slovenia for working together with us on Krško nuclear plant
It was built during Yugoslavia, but it's co-owned, maintained and used to this day
Much of Croatian potential has been squandered due to various mismanagements of policies or abuse of power and the people are quite doubtful we're capable of anything meaningful, but this common project shows otherwise
Thanks for being a bright example of how we can better arrange our country and society
I want to thank Bosnia and Herzegovina for their truly fine balkan music
Any way you prefer, be it traditional coutry music, turbofolk, (yugo-)rock, rap or other contemporary genres, it's emotional, but direct, right on target
Thanks for being a nation of jokers and poets, offering everyone around you a laugh and brightening the mood of sometimes cloudy Balkans
Thanks for burek
I want to thank Serbia for those brief moments of cooperation when the pressure and stakes were highest
Together we managed to pull something out of otherwise impossible situation (I am reffering to both yugoslav initiatives at their eary days, when the world was bearing down on us, but also to their refugees, who settled Ottoman borderlands and fought to halt their advance)
I want to thank Serbia for different (eastern) outlook of our similar culture
There are many things mystical and intoxicating about you and it's refreshing from time to time to see something cultural come out of the east
Their music works similarly to what I wrote about B&H, except it's more intense, fiery
And thanks for čevapi and pljeskavica
Finally, I want to thank Montenegro for having the least trouble with us
The relationship between us has always been pretty chill (except briefly during the 90-s siege of Dubrovnik, but I think we can move on from that)
Your drowsy reputation is hillarious and charming at the same time and it's a very positive (albeit passive) effect of having no issues with you as one of ex-yu nations
Yeah, me too
Lol, psyche, we slaughtered each other recently
Why not Russia
Russia supported the unification of Germany, ironically enough France and the UK were the most opposed
We will gladly steal Cockta from slovenians ;)
But Cedevita is a thing and Pipi is back at it
I made a whole post about prople not having Cockta or Schweppes Tangerine, so, those 2
Let's go Cockta
It is a carbonated drink like coke but with some herbs added to it and with its special touch
Better than Coca-Cola or pepsi if you ask me
It is produced in Slovenia but is widely consumed in the Balkans
Cedevita is absolute masterrace drink, I regularly pimp it to my friends here in the UK, so far 100% satisfaction rates across all cultures that have tasted it, especially in the summer
We should deffo export it more
Old yugo version of fanta
Cockta is so fricking good
Not at all
Talking about dictatorships is by far the favorite topic whenever any elections are nearby
I play in English, but if there an option for my language I'll at least see how good it is
They're mostly really bad, mainly because a lot of wordplay,puns and jokes don't work in Croatian, and it's hard to translate them
Always english subs but if the main language of the game is something else I play it with that one
Like final fantasy always stays japanes and english sub
I would rather play in Croatian if it's possible
I don't think that many games have Croatian language as an option
Well rural people aren't respected in Croatia as much as they should be
Generally they are viewed as poor simpletons by the stereotype
Of course not all of Croatia sees it that way this is what I think people might think
I only speak Croatian and English and I know that that isn't enough
I have never seen these in my life, on the internet, or in real life
But it can probably be made regularly, because croatia gets lots of snow and ice
Well I think any bigger explosion in Vukovar could be it, it was probably a competition who can make the biggest explosion in the city
Also it is Croatian victory day today :D
Pretty much all Serbian people I've met were legitimately awesome, warm, funny people
Most of Slovenians too
Hell, they've been far more friendly to me than a lot of people from other Croatian cities
I agree with everything you said
Love all our neighbours and whole Europe and our similarities and differences, best place to live
Thank you, brother
We love you to️
I LOVE milk, but haven’t drunk it since February
My skin flares up when I drink it
Can confirm - I love milk
Have at least 600ml every day
That might or might not be the best for me lol
We say "u tri pičke materine" meaning :"in three mothers pussies"
I guess Croatians would use the made up village name "Vukojebina" for that, which roughly translates to a place where wolves fuck
XD It's often used as an insult too, when you want to point out that someone is a hick from a rural area, you'd say he came from some Vukojebina
Edit: I just remembered, we also have another way to imply something being far away and/or in the middle of nowhere, we'll say the place is "u pizdi materini", which means it's "in mother's cunt". XD
Zanzibar is also worth mentioning
Aw crap
For years I've been pedantly correcting my friends and family members whenever they referred to Italians as *froggers*. I'd say something like "no man, Frenchies eat frog legs they're the froggers, Italians are *digimons*!"
My world veiw is shattered
Italians also have [a Fritzl
>someone give this guy a medal, i'm poor lol
don't worry, we are all gonna become poor soon enough
To add to all thing mentioned before, in many places local ground doesnt allow tall buildings to be built easily
There are often tunnels and remains of older buildings and foundations
Old city centres are typically too crowded to allow space and infrastructure needed for such buildings, and, especcially if only a single building is done it strongly affects the panorama of the city
To build more, it's easier to go to the outskirts and do as you wish (like they did at paris, madrid or moscow), rather thsn cram huge buildings into streets that cant fit or support them
Yeah, I wanted PVC windows and guess who forbid me to put them
My own father, then he started with rules
Taht's what happens when technician is your father
That's the point, nobody cares except my father and that's why I have wooden windows
I hate wooden windows
I have the new ones, absolute shit, his best man made them
Aluminium ones are also option, u til you hit head on the edge of one of them
Tko se nije skril, magarac je bil
if you mean specifically hide-and-seek, "Tko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
" sung out
(Who has not hidden, he is a donkey)
Do you mean whats used in hide and seek game
Tko se nije skrio magarac je bio - whoever didn't hide is a donkey
Tko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
( Who didnt hide is a donkey)
"'Ko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
" literal translation: "Who hasn't hidden was a donkey
Tko se nije skrio magarac je bio
(Who didn't hide is a donkey)
Wow, here in Croatian we call that place "Pik". I wonder where those words come from
Tko se nije skrioooo, magarac je bioooo :D
Croatians too
The Croatian Language Portal (Hrvatski jezični portal) says that it comes from French "pique" which means supposedly means "tip of a spear". I don't know how true it is but it is the only thing I could find
To me, personally, it'd be weird if someone from Serbia, Bosnia or Montenegro tried to use some of the exclusively Croatian words that exist in our language
Especially because most of the words that are different are still well known in all countries, so for example, while Croatians don't use the words hljeb, pantalone or šargarepa ("bread", "pants" and "carrot"), most people here know what they mean
I mean I imagine it would be strange to hear someone try to speak like a local and it would probably just be best to speak how they normaly speak unless people are having a hard time understanding them
Well all former yugoslav countries speak the same languages except slovenia and macedonia and no we dont mind at all we joke about other country words and its funny af
I think it is far more wierd for Serbs to use Croatian words
I think its same both ways
Regarding Serbia I don't understand the people that support certain politicians that were active during and after the war in the 90ies (primarily Slobodan Milosevic)
They made some choices leading to the death of many people on both sides including some horrific ordeals like the Srebrenica massacre
I love visiting Serbia and I really like the people there, however, some straight up deny things that happened in the war even though there are tons of evidence
Also once I saw a "Kosovo je Srbija" comment on a random American pastry Youtube video
I remember Paragon guild from wow was Finnish only guild and they were the top guild for few years
Oh yeah
remember that time when they all were saying:
>Football is comming home
Hahahahahaha
Classic English
Which is why there was so much schadenfreude when we beat them in the WC
As someone who was in the UK during the time, the insistent pestering with "it's coming home" and constant condescendion towards our national team by the pundits really grinded my gear
It came to no surprise that most of the world celebrated Croatias victory but I was surrounded with shocked Englishmen saying "I don't understand why no one likes us"
> I don't understand the people that
Here I definitely didn't mean all Serbians, but of course only the ones who do support such politicians
You are completely right about Franjo Tuđman and others like him
Some people do think he did good, but tbh it's mostly old "babe" in their 60ies and 70ies
He made some terrible decision, especially by the end of the war, which led to a lot of deaths
... that had nothing to do with support
There were some nasty stuff said about Croatia in English media and insults were thrown at our team
That, my dear coredditor, that is the arrogance we are talking about
Don't bulls*it further
Please
Don't make me go nitpicking
If we go down this rabbit whole then I can pull the argument that you guys, English, are The Worst tourists we have ever seen
So much mess involving you
But, I won't. Cause I actually like England
Believe it or not
Puahahahhaha
My God
you truly justify the claim now
You're being arogant
You see, if you just did yourself a favour and thought through a little bit before writing, we would have been in the wrong
Yet you proved us right
>bullshit unjustified xenophobic twattery
Tit
And that is not arrogance
Oh please
What exactly was a bigoted lie there
As a Croatian, I assure you that the British tourists are the least liked tourist group in my country
we literally call toothpaste "kalodont" after a brand that was widespread during yugo times
there's also the word for bandaid (hanzaplast) however it's become less common, mosr people use "flaster" which to my knowledge has no brand
Digitron is an electronics company that has become synonimous with Cauculators some people use  Digitron to mean Cauculator
Also Cedevita, for all vitamin drinks (powder + water)
We have it oficially as "sušilo za kosu" (hair dryer), but unoficially use "fen".
personally no, but i also have to admit i really haven't seen any powder vitamin drinks other than cedevita
figures
There are a lot of Cedevita copies you can find in stores
In Croatian dragon and kite are both "Zmaj". Pretty sure it's like that in Serbian, but feel free to correct me
The Croatian word for both kite and dragon is ''Zmaj''
Is zmij a viper or a snake tho
Ah ok, so a rattlesnake is zmij but a black mamba is had
Interesting
Oh, i'm not talking about the specific name for the rattlesnake, i'm talking about the name for the group in which rattlesnakes are in (vipers)
While cobras ans black mambas aren't vipers
So my question was is zmij a viper or just a venomous snake
Meh, to complicted for me to get into it but intresting never the less
And the word you're looking for is "constrictors" i believe
Well, to be frank, both Fanfare Ciocarlia and Goran Bregovic play brass-band music, so maybe he was relating more than confusing it
Dunno, just playing devil's advocate here
But yeah, any foreigner who would tell me he knows about Croatia and croatian culture better than me would have an earful
I mean Croatia is usually just the coatline, national parks and the capital Zagreb so the "videk" here is usually the east part of the country(Slavonia)
So people just have a general feel for Slavonia being the poor part looked down on even tho it is the best part of the country but I'm biased here since I live here
Yeah, the way you describe Greeks all over London was my experience with northern Balkan people throughout Germany (and a little bit in Austria)
You sit down in a restaurant and comment with your friends about how you're holding in a monster fart, when the waiter asks you "what will you drink" in a perfect Herzegovinian dialect
"Coffee with milk and a glass of water, and can you point me towards the toilet
For a bit of mind-blowing, google "Texasdeutsch".
In Croatia, *especially* if near the border, people very often go to Bosnia and Herzegovina
Reason is cause everything is cheaper there
So, we go for drinks, ćevapi (a type of local dish), pancakes, cheap swimming pools, we go to shopping there and for cheap gas and cigarettes
A lot of people study there as well, but they still keep on living in Croatia
They only commute to B&H. Though, there is still a proper border check and you could end up waiting even for an hour at the border, people still cross daily no matter
It is also very common for those sho live in Bosnia to commute to  Croatia
Either for the studies or work
Or in coastal areas for the day trip to tbe beach
In Eastern Slavonia (a region in Croatia) people also like to travel for day trips to Novi Sad and Belgrade in Serbia
Those are usually for night life and cheap drinks
Edit: And how could I forget our dear neighbours, Slovenia
I know quite a few people who travel there for work
So, they live in Croatia, but during the work week they stay (basically live) and work in Slovenia (mostly Ljubljana - the capital)
And during the weekends they come back and spend free time with family and friends
The drive between the Ljubljana and northern croatian cities is around 2 hours, so not a long drive at all
Also, many people study in Slovenia as well, so they have to commute there daily
Yeah its pretty normal for example my aunt and uncle go to Hungary every once in a while to buy groceries because some stuff is cheaper there
Everytime we're having parties we go to Hungary and buy cheap sodas, I know people near Bosnia go there for petrol and Serbia has cheaper shoes
Hungary is like 10km from my town so we go there pretty often and Serbia is not far either if I need some new shoes
Hungary is also pretty useful because they have Tesco and Aldi
Only thing is we're not in the Schengen area so we have to have ID cards to cross but it doesn't take long
18€???????? Thats almost an entire full priced Paradox DLC
Dont you guys like not have ID because it infringes on a small percentage of the population's "freedom". You have the social security thingy right
Yeah I heard you guys take ferries to Estonia for cheaper alcohol
And Estonians to Latvia (when does the cycle end
Always wondered why we use helicopter when we have a perfectly normal croatian word for it: zrakomlat (literally "the thing that beats up air")
In Croatia we don't have our own word for colour
The word "boja" comes from Turkey
Some regions in Croatia also use the words farba (from german) and pitura (from italian)
Hey, we have huncut (in some places funcut or vuncut) as well
I never knew my grandpa was calling me dog's vagina when I misbehaved
Doesn't "ćuprija" mean "bridge"?
Because it sounds ridiculous, like most "normal Croatian words" that are promoted by idiotic language purists
And here Motorola turned into an eponim meaning any kind of walkie talkie or also bastardized to Voki Toki
Yes
At least in Croatian as far as I know and our online dictionary says, ćuprija=most and there is no other meaning for it
German, most of the people learn German as second foreign language in school
But also Italian, specifically in Istria region it's second official language
German
Some schools have German as their first second language too especially in the central and northern part
Other stuff is Italian on the west side in Istria as the first second and that is about it
So the most spoken second languages are German in the majority and Italian in the minority
Write it as two seperate thigns, please and thank you very much our dear neighbour
:) hahah
Correct
Most of continental parts of Croatia speak German as 2nd or 3rd language and most of the coats speaks Italian
Both langaugaes are widely taught in schools and used to communicate with tourists during summer season
we are taught from the birth to work in touristic branches
Quite popular among <35 people
I'd say most younger people smoke it every now and then
Very popular among younger people
But some people look at it like fucking heroin
I think legalisation would benefit out country greatly
And when done in moderation it is a safe drug
In 10-20 years it will be legalised everywhere in the world
Why not be one of the first ones
The way words are pronounced (each letter makes the same sound everytime) makes this impossible to happen
Not really
Speak as you write language and all
The most problematic would be finding out if someone has a j in the name or not, eg Mija or Mia, Andreja or Andrea, Marijo or Mario
Something similar in croatian would be names like: Matea/Mateja
You don't really hear the difference in those names in everyday speach
Well, actually, there are names that can be written with or without a j, but the pronunciation doesn't change, such as Antonia/Antonija, Mario/Marijo, Dario/Darijo, etc
It is the same letter as Croatian "Dž".
"Dž" is also spelled with multiple letters but seen as one and pronounced as one
"Sh-ch-y" I think
Someone correct me if I am wrong
Yes
I tried to spell it in English
If you want, I can spell it in German: Sch-Tsch-i
Edit: I forgot you guys use very similar alphabet like we do and read the letters the same way
Lol pretty cool
"Rz" is like Croatian "Ž". Same thing
Hahahahah
But bro, only 3 letters of those "special ones" in our alphabet are written with two characters
Those are: nj, lj, and dž.
The rest are normal: š, č, ć, ž, đ
Is there a slight difference in the pronounciation between RZ and Ż, U and Ó?
I have a suggestion
Why don't you guys adopt an alphabet we (Croatians) have and the world will be at peace
Much easier
We literally have the same sounds, minus-plus one or two
Damn, I knew the Japanese didn't like foreigners, but I really didn't think it'd be that bad
I'm glad your daughter is alright
I mean, yes, but actually no
This is sort of a stupid question for Europe
It's a relativley small "continent" holding a relativley large amount of people
But in Croatia at least you could get areas like that but it would be rather difficult to find
Nontheless we have very beautiful nature and gorgeous landscapes and it's something I personally take a lot of pride in
Depends on your definition
But I believe it should be possible for large swaths of Lika/Dinara/Velebit are
Probably not but we have mountains which are really sparsely populated and I think you can easily get lost there but to live like in total isolation I think not because it is too small
Other places like our mountains are some forests inland where you can get absolutely lost and of course if you would live on a ship in the middle of the Adriatic
Well sort of, there are parts of my country that are very poorly populated , but I think that you can't get more isolated then an hour ride
Except if you decide to live on one of hundreds uninhabited islands
Probably depends on the area
I wouldn't say you're always 100% safe
But mines are less of a problem here than say Bosnia
i would love to rad that story, in english if possible
We had a [prime minister] who was born in Nazi labour camp in Germany
I don't think it was held against him
On the other hand we also had a [prime minister] who was Croatian Canadian (born in Zagreb though), not even elected but agreed upon by a coalition, his struggle with language and his gaffes were often joked about (he started his mandate by saying "he will serve the buildings" instead of citizens - *građevine/građani*; and once for a punchline in a speech he obviously google-translated word by word "keep calm and govern on" with "*ostati mirni i vladaju na*" which made absolutely no sense) but I wouldn't say he was disliked for it
Quite controversial
Incredibly so if it was ex-Yu
Maybe the only option that could be perceived as good is Germany/Switzerland/Fennoscandia
The rest is varying amount of outrage
Other race would blow heads
Dont forget the long reigning duke of nepotism, milan bandic
He's not a head of state per se but is our capital's mayor and has been for 15 years
He is from bosnia and herzegovina, he moved to zagreb in his early 20s.
TBH he quite often gets called out for that
Never liked that
Just like I never liked him
No, Prime minister has far more power then president in Croatia
I don't know about the Hungarian Index, but the Croatian one is trash
It's anti government for sure but very trash
I don't think we had any continous long lasting friends
Hasn’t Ukraine been chummy lately with Croatia
That's actually true when you think about it
We have no long lasting friends :(
Actually what is weird, in start we had pretty good relations with Serbs, we even helped (saved) them with their war against Simeon I, at that time we also had alliance with Byzantines
There is some really interesting information here
I would put you guys as our potential best friend (if we aren't right now)
True was just wondering if anything had changed since I heard last
>I always considered Liechtenstein as our 27th canton
Is that why you are always invading them
I still don't get why do you chuckle at this conception
This "random english words" conception is very common in Croatia, and stores like C&A, Kik, H&M and NewYorker sell those shirts on a regular basis
Nobody pays attention to what those words say, it's important that they have sone graphic, because plain shirts are out of fashion
I have tonnes of them at home, I could photograph them if you want
That is because there are no standards for those shirts
Any combination of English words that sort of make sense are printed on those shirts
As we're speaking, I am wearing a "denim manufacturing company USA" shirt
Luxurious places are also added here, but anything will do
We have zero standards
barely any puns (it's hard to make them) but when they exist they're the funniest shit ever
otherwise, a lot of sarcasm, hyperbole, and dry delivery humor
shock humor is also popular
Literally the country bumpkin stereotype of "Haha crude stuff funny"
AKA if the joke has shit, sex, or something extremely gross it's "funny" but if you have to think about the joke it's lame and you're being a nerd or something
(This is my own experience with it, might be different for others)
Country is Croatia
I guess thats European humour

(sorry)
Meet Milan Bandić, our immortal and undefeated 30-year-reigning grand master of corruption, mayor of Zagreb, our capital
He has no voice left
He speaks like a chicken that is being strangled to death, he's been on many surgeries, he looks 15 years older than he is
Switching 2 parties, making his own, a true master of shameless political trade
A guy has commited 5 years of his life to making a movie about his corruption-filled reign, and Bandić shows up to the premiere, says the movie is trash, doesn't even watch it, leaves
He isn't giving up without a fight
Why is he so persistent
Money and crime are the answers
He and his friends, mistresses and cousins have stolen godknows how much of our money and years of what would have been progress
If we don't dunk him next year I'm going to be more than disappointed
Bandić is the sole reason I miss death penalty
Where were you in '91 ?
>joke was Ursula von der Leyen
Why her
Pelješki most here
Megoslav
No, yougoslav
I see
Our media doesn't seem to criticize any bigshot name from the EU in general
It's a surprise to see people from Germany have a negative sentiment towards her
So Romanians are both vampires and hobbits
I read about EU and EU member states politics almost as much as domestic ones
I don't follow them that closely but I know for example which parties hold the governments (maybe not every by name but by which EU parliament group they belong to and that gets me close enough to what kind of politics they stand for)
I also get the latest big news from all European countries in euractiv's newsletter 'Capitals'.
I mostly follow ours, but also this year I've been closely following the Belarus protests
Also the occasional nuggets of EU news and news from other countries
I know only about some in my town (Dubrovnik)
Island of Daksa is an small island on which dozens of priests and people that were against fascist regime were executed
There are a few abandoned hotels and houses that are kinda scary
A body was found latley in one of the houses
Villa rašica is a villa where satanists are doing their rites and sacrefices
I dont really know why but im sure ur looking at right place
I think its same in all of europe
We all drink like fucking maniacs
I fucking hate that man

Happy birthday
What about leaving it on the floor or throwing it in the trash infront of some kids
Croatia
We have hundreds of political parties, but only a few are relevant
Two largest political parties are Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica - HDZ (ruling party, moved from right wing to right wing-center recently) and SDP - Socijal demokratska partija (moderate left wing)
Both are pro EU, heavily clientelistic and support state interventionism
They differ in ideologies a bit; HDZ is more conservative and SDP more liberal
Together, they hold 2/3 of our parliament
Other notable players:
Domovinski pokret - far right, assembled around famous folk singer, mostly famous for their anti-communist, anti-Serbian, anti-gay rhetoric
Možemo - new political party, formed by former green activist, focus their efforts on fighting corruption in our capital
Controversial because of their collaboration with smaller far left parties
Fokus/Pametno - also new party, liberals
Most - right wing clerical populist, became famous as non-ideological party fighting agaist corruption
Živi Zid - populists, anti-vax, anti-immigrant, anti-EU, very famous in one period but not in the parliament anymore
EDIT: Thx u/carrottossy for the reminder
There is also Most (Most nezavisnih lista) but I don't really understand what they are
In Croatia, standard is to have just FIRST NAME + LAST NAME
I don't think the law recognizes Middle names at all
However, the law about personal names says that you can have up to two words for each category
They can be written with a dash or without the dash
standard: Ivan Horvat
maximum: Ema Lorena Franić Stanić
First name + Last name
Sometimes we have two first names, but we don't use middle names and we don't consider the second first name a middle name
One name and one surname (usually paternal) is the norm
Occasionally people will have two names and married women can have two surnames (and in turn carry that to their children)
Anything more than that is highly unusual
Its same in croatia
I will add that catholics upon baptism get baptismal name that is derived from the day you're born and saint or same as your godfather or godmother
its not formal name but is name that catholic church recognize you by and keep in  their books
Because during the time the mass killings and atrocities were happening Congo was not a Belgian colony and the Belgian government had no control of it
It was called the Congo Free State and it was the personal property of King Leopold
Belgium later annexed the colony **specifically to end** all the shit that was happening
So I see absolutely no reason why the Belgian government would apologize for something it didn't do
If anyone then the royal family
I would've gone blind and probably died as a kid
Same, mine made one of the first shipyards in Croatia in the 18th century, so I'd probably be a sailor which isnt too far off what I am doing now
But it sucked more for gay people
I’ve been told as a kid that Santa lived in Rovaniemi, Finland
In Croatia, Santa lives in the Lappi region of Finland
Croatian tradition says that Santa lives in a state or city treasury
You have to be a member of a party, do what you are told the whole year, he is making a list, checking it twice, and then you get lucrative contracts so you can buy yourself whatever you want
The downside is that a significant percentage of cash goes under the table back to Santa
There is a spin off after the new testament called game of thrones
That we drive on left side in Croatia
he was an american
Last year, as a part of Croatia's big reform of education system, they printed a new set of textbooks for schools, with QR codes for interactive learning
Together with that, the government ordered tablets for schools, so teachers and kids can easily scan QR codes and gain access to materials
Here's the good part - **around 6000 tablets they bought didn't have cameras
Today in our highschool we tried reinstalling Windows xp, it didn't work
Why would that be embarrassing, XP is quality
This has Balkans written all over it
I feel like I'm in a parallel universe where we're better than you in at least something lol
honestly
swear words
"shall you get fucked by a block of ice" doesn't roll off the tongue that well
In Croatia it's most of the cash grab condos and appartment complexes for rent to tourists during the summer
They are usually right by the sea, and 90% of them are monstrosities that should have never been built
This [ugly] thing that destroyed the baroque architecture around it
Also, I despise this [building
Yes
Because of the Treaties Croatia signed with Vatican i think
Yes, but you don't learn just about Catholicism but about other religions in the world as well, and you discuss stuff
Also, it is really easy to get a good grade and that automatically boosts your average
In high school you choose between religion and ethics, and most people take ethics, whereas in primary school you just have religion and you can either take it or write to the school that you want to drop the class (mostly kids who are not Catholic do that, everyone else takes it because it's easy)
Yes, but as an elective subject
I'm not happy with what they teach kids in religion classes, I think the church should have no say in the education of our children, but it is what it is
And we make atheists pay churches through the taxes
Varaždin used to be capital of Croatia until the big fire torn it down
Zagreb was capital city since then
However, I would propose the baroque city of Karlovac to be new capital of Croatia
Karlovac is smaller and more centrally located in terms of geography
It's old city center is a bastion in shape of a star with nice orthogonal street blocks
The center of Karlovac is now somewhat forgotten and sad, with a lot of ruined buildings
I think it could be renewed with both classical and new contemporary buildings to make use for all central governemt needs
Brasov is a good central option don't you think
Nice city too as I heard
I'd pick Osijek, since the region would get an economic boost probably
Only con I can see is it's distance to the border with Serbia
And you don't know what's going to happen there regarding their politics
Karlovac is close to both borders which is unsafe but our whole position is unsafe
Further to the coast is safer but the other part of the country would be very outshined which is why Zagreb is a perfect location
Other than Zagreb maybe Bjelovar do
Zagreb is also close to the border
You can't find a city which isn't close to the border but Karlovac is close to 2 borders which is easily occupied
When war comes we should just move capitals depending on who is attacking
More than you'd think, actually
Just because of our neighbour countries wanting to get in, but we kinda have to agree to that, but we don't, it's all very confusing
Our country is very important in tourism aspect
It provides a safe, beautiful and affordable place for our fellow Europeans to spend their long awaited vacation
It is also (imo) a prime example of how to be patriotic and truly love what is our own, but still be part of the bigger family and respecting that aspect of it as well
Hmm you have given me an idea
The EU doesn't really care about your system of government as long as your country more or less follows the EU's strategic goals
And thank you for that, French leadership on these things has been great
If only others would follow
And it will be even more confusing in years to come
Unfortunately, yes
:-(
Its not free, we pay it through taxes
Better word to use is universal
Every system has its downsides
Ours would be longer waiting times if you are not an emergency case
But the good thing is that private healthcare is pretty affordable due to universal healthcare because if it was too expensive, nobody would use it
So if you dont want to wait, you can go private and pay
But if you have cancer or some serious condition, you will get care as soon as possible
Regular check-ups are the one you have to wait for a little bit longer
I would say that american healthcare is under bigger political influence because people make huge money out of it and there political parties are divided on this subject
In Europe, political parties pretty much have a consensus on the way healthcare should be
Not true that only two societies treat non residents
We had a lot of immigrants who were hurt illegaly crossing our country and they received instant care without any payment
Also there are a lot of situation in which tourists were injured and they also received care immidately without big bills
They paid the same as we residents would if we didnt have coverage
Oh, you meant that kind of things
Yes, I agree
Its the same here
Basque language sounds like a Spaniard speaking an encrypted version of spanish
Its flow of speech is the same as spanish, it uses same phonemes as spanish, but it replaces just about any spanish word with a completely different word
you a Serb or Montenegrin
I know that japanese does it
which other languages put their last name up front
I never thought Portugese sounds anything like Russian
However, keep in mind my first language is Slavic, so it's pretty easy for me to differentiace Slavic from other languages
And as for Portugese - I love the language, it's so, so beautiful
When you guys pronounce your 'r's it sounds like you're trying to gather saliva in your mouth for a nasty spit

"Basic school"
Get up at 07:30 rush to get to school till 08:00, I did not much like to go to school
Lessons were 45 mins long with pauses of 5 mins and 2 longer ones for eating after 3th lesson and 4th
Class 1-4 would eat at cantina after 3th lesson while class 5-8 would eat after 4th lesson
Also got beaten up a lot that is why I did not like it
"High school"
Basicly the same thing just we had 2 shifts cuz there were too many kids so it started at 08:00 and 14:00 sometimes ealier I had to take a bus there 25 km
bus went at 06:15 and 12:15, I had to wake up early when I was 1st shift at lest I was liked here and none beated me up I loved high school wish I could go back
"Uni"
I was only here cupple months seen it was not for me and I droped out
Too many stuck up profesors tbh would just sit at desk and show you PDF
Not every Uni probably
Croatia
It's the same in Croatia but we had our lunch break after the 3rd period
And
How did he taste
Kekkonen Kekkonen Kekkonen
But for real, the 2nd president of independent Croatia (Stjepan Mesić) also agreed to have presidential powers limited, and even argued for that move
Our first president, Franjo Tuđman, ruled throughout the 90s and abused his wide-ranging powers
Well, that's a shame
Same in Croatia
Every year there's Home Alone on TV
From Croatia
No, we have such diverse facial and hair features that you can see blond, redhead, brown, and black haired and complections fair and dark and between
In a country just above 4 million population
just in my family, we have blonds dark-hair, blue, green, hazel and brown eyes
Tall, short
In my part of the country people are really tall, some of the tallest people in Europe, that is really obvious seeing most women are above 170 cmheight
Me being 185 cm tall man am average hight here
I went to highschool in northern partt of country where I was above average tall
I like that diversity, its cool
we dont have African or Asian descent people here though (very small percentage) and you will not see that kind diversity even in the capital
Sometimes when whatching british series, white people look the same stereotip is noticable for me, LOL
To me Hugh Grant and Robert Pattinson absolutely scream English
I disagree, maybe people from regions of the country look somewhat different but I looked around this thread and most people from the other countries are very visibly NOT Croatian, and I live in Dalmatia and during the summer it's generally not that hard to tell apart natives and tourists, just by facial features alone
Also, what I noticed after moving abroad is that a lot of girls in Croatia don't wear that much makeup at all
It could be considered "light" by a lot of standards, and that guys dress [nicely]
This
You can perhaps tell them apart only in regards to fashion and make up
I know for instance that girls in Croatia don't wear a lot of make up, while in certain other countries that is not the case, but then again you can always find that one girl who looks up to a certain country (USA or other) for fashion influences and who will look like that
So you are 100% right
You’ve never heard about the Czechs
You forgot about nightly towel invasion of beaches
I disagree with you
For instance, [she] is from the northern part of Croatia, but I bet that a lot of other nations with lighter skin tones and light hair colors would be able to say that she "belongs" to them
Just like [her] who is from the south
Also, [Ivana Brkic] looks nothing like a south/east European, or something that you would say is "basic" Croatian at first glance
(I am using celebrities as examples because I don't want to post pictures of random people here)
But then you have this [look] that's a bit darker, or this [one] I don't think that there are facial features that are just Croatian, but we could distinguish one another in style, manners, walk, etc
Every single person in these pictures is Croatian, but yet again each one has its own distinctive facial features
I cannot say, what my admitedly subjective opinion is that Crot women are really good looking
I think that do wear less makeup tha Serbian women, which are also pretty, but they have stronger Turbofolk (trashy faux folk music and scene) culture that is like 'more the better' , and unnatural look is what they are going for
to be honest turbofolk is popular in Croatia too, but I think that girls in casual and everyday life wear less makeup but weekend you can see all sorts of
crazy
Also in such a small country there are lot of temperament and 'lifestyle' differences between different regions
My mother's side of the family is fair skinned and light eyed but my father is dark haired
I am pretty much blond but I have brown eyes
My friend for example trough the winter is pretty pale but  tan easily in summer, he has prominent nose so if he were to travel in U.S. it believe that people would give him the eye because he could pass as Arab
His half sister is blue eyed and ashen hair
Funny that
Genetics
They all have big heads
You mean five heads heh
I would say so, yes
Just in my small town theres alot of girls and women that are apsolutly stunning and since I live in touristy place I heared lot of foriegners expressing their amazment of how many good looking people they see here
I can always recognize foriegners and in many cases guess where there from easily
Dubrovnik
The town of game of thrones, the big walls and UNESCO heritage site makes it every year a place where you can't walk through because of all the tourists
Everything is expensive there too
Hmm
Most of the coast is very touristy, with addition of Plitvice Lakes
I'd say northern Croatian coast has way too many tourists for its capacity at normal years
Dubrovnik, tho, is way overcrowded
Main area has maybe a square kilometre and probably around 50k people at every second
Probably more
Area around Salzburg and the south of Austria is also very nice
Istria actually gets more visitors as the other reply said but Dubrovnik itself gets a bunch and Istria as a whole gets more
Glad you liked Umag I went there too and it was a fun time
Anything can really be a souvenir especially if you find some souvenir things for free
Yeah, in Dalmatia you can find peaceful places you can actually rest in, unlike places like Dubrovnik, Rovinj, Plitvice Lakes which are overcrowded with people, and imo, there should be regulations in Dubrovnik for Old Town entry (Stradun area) since it is so overcrowded you can barely walk there
Not even expensive parking lots and apartments can stop people from coming
I'm not saying it is bad to have a lot of tourists, however, when you can't walk at all it becomes annoying
I'd say Dubrovnik's Old Town is so dense with people in summer it beats any other place on Earth lol
That's what happens when you have an old, preserved city which was once a powerful city-state
Just don't go to main tourist places if you like peace
Istria is full of people wherever you go, Kvarner is full of cheap and annoying, monotone tourists (except Opatija maybe), Dalmatia is huge so there will be a lot of non-touristy places which is nice
Islands are somewhat touristy, and in the end, Dubrovnik is way too overcrowded and needs more regulations imo
Alps are stunning
Coming there in May, it still had snow and it was the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen in my life
Well, I know that Minnesota is not Michigan, which surpasses the knowledge of Trump's lawyers
I would know to point 4/5ths of all states, New england being the problem except Vermont and Massachusetts,I know their shape
I know capitals of around half of all states, New England again being a problem, Pennysylvania, North and South Carolina, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Oregon and Washington state, I never bothered to learn their capitals nor I had a chance to hear about them
For example I'd like to visit western US (without oregon, washington and california)
Chayenne because it's a biggest rodeo, 3 states that make up Yellowstone so naruelly I heard about these and know their capitals
Is it possible to learn this power
Are you glad that you live in the EU
r/gaeilge is much more active
My great-grandpa ended up in a concetration camp
He Got out becouse a German needed someone to help around the house who spoke German
Thenn after a while he helped him escape back to Croatia where he fought in the partisans
It is terrible
It is (or was until recently
) moderated by far right mods so any article related to history, sociology, politics etc
is by definition bad and full of bias at best and blatant lies and fabrications at worst
History articles are heavily biased and are casually trying to show that nazi puppet state was a good thing
I think it is ok but nowhere near as good as the English one
I automatically avoid the croatian wikipedia or "wikipedija"
In most places yes but I believe some places have pretty bad infrastructure so tap water isn't exactly drinking water
[Overpoleing] with traffic poles
When I was growing up I thought that was a normal amount of poles to keep the traffic normal and safe

From the first word I knew it was gonna be Zagreb
Same in Croatia
You're joking, but you don't know just how close you are to the truth
Same here
Bydgoszcz and those two Romanian cities really surprised me as I had no idea they existed
Also I though Murcia wasn't nearly as big
If you're Anglophone, German or Italian, don't. We want to speak *your* language
slavic languages
easy to read once you know the alfabet, however verb aspects and cases will make you wish you weren't born
Start with Serbian, trust me, it is easier
Pro-tip
don't
Agree
We have the exact same 7 cases, kind of surprised it's the same in Latvian
I learned German, it is such an awful language, but a lot of German tourist don't speak English so what can I do
And Serbian is much more easier for Anglophones than Croatian
What inspires you to learn my language
Are you a fanboy of our NT
Was your great-grandpa a Croat
There is a lot of vocabulary differences, We have three main groups of dialects and our linguist tried to incorporate some words from other dialects so standard Croatian has a lot of difficult/unknown words for Serbian speakers
So, if a Serb is speaking Standard Serbian I could understand them much better than they could me
Also, we have some dialects that are more difficult to understand than for example standard Slovenian
And a lot of Croats speaks in various dialects on daily bases which are far from standard form
In Serbia they have much less linguistic diversity
We also made up a lot of words for technical things while Serbian uses a lot of loan words from English, German
I wager you're either 3rd or 4th generation immigrant
It seems that you're very proud of your heritage
You care deeply about your family, and you want to improve your connection with your relatives still living in the  motherland
Getting fluent with the language will definitively help you with that
If it's of any value to you, I met plenty of Germans who spoke very good Croatian (B2 level), so if those Germanic-speaking folks that are notorious for being bad at foreign languages can pull it off, I've no shred of a doubt you can do it too
You come off as a person that's very eager to learn so that's good
The key is to find a person willing enough to be your language parent, as teaching our language to foreigners takes a crap-ton of patience and determination
Language schools are an option -- if you ever relocate to Zagreb you have [this] language school as well as [this one] Both are allegedly pretty good
If you wanna learn it for free though, it's pretty feasible but you're gonna have to go ham with approaching and befriending new people until you find someone willing to teach
Just like Germans, most Croats will gladly wait for you at the finish line and speak to your in their mother tongue once you become very proficient, but won't want to help you get there 'cause they'd rather use you to improve their English
Upping your charisma skill and persistently meeting new people will ensure that you'll find your language sensei
Props on getting your citizenship
It'll come in handy if you ever decide to start a business in Croatia

99% of the time
100% of the time in croatian
Although tbh I believe if you develop an ear for a language (and it uses a phonetic alphabet) you can spell almost anything
Every single word
Serbo-Croatian (oh boi why did I write it like that) is 100% phonetically written
Except when it comes to place and people names
We write them like they are or we slavicize
the words while Serbian just phonetically spells them
Example: James(Croatian) Đejms(Serbian)
Thank God, Croatian is phonetically written, so we can always know how to pronounce or write down a word upon hearing it for the first time
My dad knows a bit of English and always complains about its messy pronunciation
Vers vert verre ver
Close to a green glass worm
I think French gets too much flack for this
Aside from accents, it's not that hard to spell
Our professor gave us the rules of spelling French on day one and I seldom ever made mistakes
Po Vuku Karadžiću
There is a small issue with -ije or -je
For an example: A Candle is spelled properly "SvIJEća", but people can make a mistake and spell it "SvJEća" - without the "i". To me personally that us EXTREMELY easy and I can hear the difference and have always spelled those words properly, but many do not
Also, we have slight difference between "č" (hard "ch" sound) and "ć" (soft "ch" sound)
Example: a House - Kuća (correct spelling) or Kuča (wrong spelling)
In slovenian they do not have this problem as they use only "č" and Serbs have clear distinction in the pronounciation between those two, so they make less mistakes
We Croats tend to make more mistakes as we speak softly and our "č" is REALLY close to "ć".
In conclusion, that 1% which has left in his 99% is this what I wrote up here
I wouldn’t say 100% ‘cause of ije/je and č/ć. So 98% :D
Serbian, in other hand, would be 101% (Anđelina Đoli)
Since you have done some research and are from Ukraine can you tell me about Ukranian "ikavian"? How much people use it, is it standard in some areas
Don't know how you say it but Croatian has ikavian dialect
For example standard Croatian word for "milk" woud be "mlijeko", but in ikaviav dialect it would be "mliko" and ekavian is "mleko". Thats the main difference in dialects here (ex-yugo) ije/e/i with lots of other examples
I've read somewhere that only Croatian and Ukranian have that ikavian form of speech
Most of the slavic languages from our perspective would be in ekavian form with just 'e' not 'ije'/'i'.
č/ć are easy if you are not an idiot
They have completely different formations in the mouth (does your tongue go up or down
) . Ije/je are also fairly easy and the only word that is not intuitive to spell is rječnik
It should be ije
Transliterating foreign names into your language (when you have a viable alphabet to spell them as originally) seems to bastardize them for me
I would have to learn a separate spelling of a name for every language I know
Plus I can't imagine reading a book and having to read Čarls or Vilijem or Đon
You need to learn the rules of any language's spelling
You think non-yugos know how to pronounce š, č, ć, đ, ž, lj, nj, dž? C and j? I think this question should apply to languages that have too ambiguous rules or the rules simply don't work in practice as well as they're supposed to
Ok, though we still have this problem where even when someone pronounces it right, students still tend to write it wrong
I have no idea how and why, cause to me that was always the easiest task in the test, but it happens often
No, it is not cause of the cyrillic
We have "dž" (so two characters) for the hard sound of "đ". Also that "đ" can be spelled as "dj", just not in the official use
As it was spelled that way before in our language cause our written characters (sounds) are modeled after written Czech
Though, that would still not fix our issue here as all of us hear differently and people would still mix up those sounds like they do with -ije and -je
Serbuan has the same latin script and they tend NOT to mix up the letters as they put a lot more emphasizes oj the sounds than we do
In most dialects yes
Some places still pronounce č and ć like you, but on the far extreme of the spectrum are some Dalmatian islands which pronounce ć as tj, č as ć, and č as you know it doesn't even exist
You are right with "hlib" that is ikavian version of serbian "hleb", we use "kruh" instead but in "jekavian" form would be "hljeb".
Oh I see and from what you wrote my guess is that ikavian is like standard in Ukraine
You say "hlib" while ekavian would be "hleb" like in other slavic languages
We say "kruh" anyway so no need for dialects here
That's obvious though
Of course I need to learn grammar to use the language properly
The genuine exceptions would be verbs like arreter, jeter, or appeller, wherein you have one of the letters dropping or the accent moving
Yeah, I know what you mean
And right, more pupils
Hahah But students aren't immune to it
(i used students as an example as that is in my age range)
Btw, I always wondered do you guys in Montenegro have similar issue with "š" and "ś" like "č" and "ć?
I get it now
Sometimes it's 'je/ije' sometimes 'i' and sometimes 'e' depending on the word itself
Thx for replies
We kicked je/e it's just "drvo" here hahah
That is quite fascinating actually
I had no idea you guys use soft sounds so much haha
Btw, thanks for the answer
Well it's not official in my country, but when I used to come home from going out during weekends while having drunk too much, I'd say I'm going to pray at the altar
I work in the air traffic control and when we go to take a shit we say "i'm going to give a release for descent".
I've heard a few people say "idem gdje se i najhrabriji useru". Translated: I'm going where even the bravest shit themselves
Otherwise, we call the bowl školjka (seashell), and the room toalet (toilet) or WC
I can only think of Školjka or WC Školjka
Školjka means clam
Same
Well, the name of tbe country and one of the most popular names are enough for start - Hrvatska and Hrvoje
French people just adore these
Is this other thing a table with broken legs
In Zagreb, you call them ‘brate’, which means brother
In Istria, they say fratello/fra too
I am not sure of the other regions
Do you also refer to your parents as "stari/stara"? It's a normal thing here
This sums up pretty well
What was your country's historical moment that was so ridiculous you couldn't believe it when you heard about it
Winning against the Ottomans 4 times and saving Europe cuz of that
*B O I*
That reminds me of a movie ...

How diverse Croatia is for having such a small land area and population
Thats why saying that croatia is either balkan or central european or mediterranean doesnt make any sense, because its all of those things, depending on the region
Dubrovnik, now best known for being Kings Landing and a popular tourist spot, has very rich and interesting history

* it was one of the first states to [ban slavery in modern times]
* it was one of the first states to [officially recognize the US independence]
5th of may was the battle for castle Itter, the last stand of the Nazi war machine
The war was practically over then, all that was left was to give the coup de grace
Slavic is just a linguistic term, it doesnt imply geography or culture (to some extent, but not exactly)
Same way as finland doesn't really have anything to do with hungary despite the languages being related
EDIT: Answering your question: We are definitely more like the Swiss verision of scouts
We have the regular scouts (Izviđači), which I'm not really familiar with, and they seem like a much smaller organisation, and we have Catholic Scouts (Katolički Skauti)
I myself am still a part of the Catholic Scouts and was since 2013, and it was indeed a pleasure, even though we seem to grow much more inactive as time goes by
My best memories coming from the past decade I could easily thank to scouting
We are a closely connected to the Church and it's what has mostly funded us when we went on bigger trips, and our slogan is "God Church Country 100%" / "Bog Crkva Domovina 100%" (BCD 100%), so it's expected of us to be at least somewhat religious, and the majority of as indeed are
We also say our vows in front of our bishop
In the early years we went on smaller trips in the local countryside every two weeks or so and had quite a good time, but bigger trips were always the shit
We own house near the city of Rijeka given to us by the local bishop some decades earlier and the scouts then renovated it, now  it's a go-to place every summer
We also own a little island some kilometers of the coast of Šibenik where we spend 2 weeks every summer, which i prefer over going to the coastline with my family
Other than that you could expect other "scoutly" activities, so camping, learning to tie knots, spending time in the country side etc
, and also attending many religious happenings in the area since we after all are CATHOLIC Scouts
It is indeed a pity that the organisation seems to be fading away, at least in my area, since it holds a great deal of awesome childhood memories
Same here
The "izviđači" were much much more popular during Yugoslavia and a day rarely goes by without my dear mother telling me how awesome it was
I was not myself a scout in Croatia but I have spent considerable time with them and noticed no boy/girl division
In fact, I believe it would be an insult to them to even propose such a thing
Is that an oddity in European scouting (because judging by comments it is)
I thought the gendered division is exclusively an Anglo thing
Yes, we have quite a bit in Croatia, here are just 2 biggest ones: amphitheater in Pula and Diocletian palace in Split
But some remains can be found in almost every coastal city
Croatia
Arenas like one in Pula, palaces like Diocletian's in Split
My birthtown Vinkovci (Cibalae) was founded by Romans and seems to be the oldest continually habitated town in Europe
We also have the remains of Salona, Narona and other big cities
The Narona museum is one of the best I've ever visited
[zamjenit cu te gorim] by natali dizdar
10+ year old song, but it's still so so pleasing
(croatia)
[This song]
It has a good beat to it and I like listening to it when working/studying
Also not many people (even from croatia) know about it
Heck, even I didn't know it was from croatia until just a few weeks ago
It just doesn't sound like the stuff we usually make
When DotA became a meme I decided to listen to all gis stuff
Was not disappointed
Well we can all agree we like burek
Kranjska kobasica buurek
' I need to trryy thatt
Where can I buy it
Russia does provide Germany with gas
They never leave packages
Smaller are put in the mailbox, but big ones are ither signed and delivered in person or, more often nowadays since deliveries increased by a lot, the post worker brings a slip saying your package is at local post office
People don’t use online delivery enough for packages to be stolen here
Rijeka
Sorry, if I remember correctly from one of earlier similar threads, Slough takes the cake
Cila slavonija
European capital of culture, beautiful (tough it needs renovation) city centre, port area, university, unique topography
Rijeka has some problems, and can look boring from the highway, but once you get into it it's quite interesting city
There are definitely more boring cities or towns in Croatia
Looking at you Slavonski brod, Sisak
i actually really like belgrade except the traffic
i'd go fucking crazy if i lived there
or would end up dead
what really grinds my gears is how many people just decide to park their car in one of the fucking lanes and it's so widespread it's unbelievable
last time i was there a week ago and i've passed infront of a police station where they used the right lane as their private parking
approximately 10 police cars were just parked in the middle of the road, blocking traffic and blocking the right turn lane completely
i lose my shit when i see something like that
Belgrade is pretty big and my family lives in Zarkovo which isnt close to anything so there's no other way
the only one that comes to mind is kukac(bug) where if you turn the second k into an r you get kurac(dick)
jede (he/she is eating) Ona jede povrće/She's eating vegetables
jebe - (he/she is fucking) Ona jebe povrće/She's fucking vegetables
kukac - bug
kurac - dick
Here it is basically free, only a small fee of around 40€ is paid at the beginning of the year if you pass all the subjects
Croatia has free universities but idk if they have classes in english
Housing in student homes is also free but you got to have points to get in
Food and drinks
Everytime I travel abroad, to western countries at least, I am absolutely shocked at how expensive your food is
One apple and a bottle of water there could buy me a whole lunch here
Also, public toilets
1€ is waaaay to much
You ought to visit Czech Republic buddy if you think food in serbia is the cheapest
Are you sure about that
I prefer regular rain
But this year we had an occurence  while I was at sea, where it didnt rain but it was thundering
It looked pretty sick you know
Like the purplish pink lighting being pincired by deep dark blue clouds
I wish I couldve taken a picture
It really was
japanke - the japanese (flip flops)
ogledalo - looker (mirror)
Slavs: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
Condescending - snishodljiv
con - with (s-) in French where it originates from
descending - doesn't have a literal translation in its own but we basically took niz "down" and hodljiv "the one who is able to walk" and combined it to mean descending
Ne kontam zadnji
sta znaci vo
Nosorog - in croatian
So, the same as well "Nose Horn".
not likely but they might have the same roots, ogledalo comes from the verb gledati (look) which comes from russian gljadét
Aha, mi kazemo vol
Shvacam, cuo sam "so" prije ali nikad "vo" pa me malo zbunilo
Ugodan dan
Divno, hvala

We also have brown bears and wolves, but idk what was the last time someone got attacked by them

Wouldn't dogs be the most dangerous animals if we use that logic

Somehow, I don't think it was unintentional
A) i dont even own or fly a national flag for "our own" holidays
B) i dont own an EU flag nor know anyone who does
And C) i had no idea may 9th is europe day, it is not celebrated in any way so there will be no extra EU flags anywhere
Metastases for Croatia
Aleksi
Družba Pere Kvržice or Vlak u snijegu
Both are children's book movie adaptations but they're both very good
Metastaze
ZG80, Metastaze
Živi i mrtvi, Broj 55
How accurate it is ?
I'd much rather recommend ''Sokol ga nije volio'' or in English, "Sokol did not like him", it shows just how much Croatia was torn between two differing ideologies during 2nd world war, two ideologies that for a simple man living in rural area did not mean nothing, but still took everything from him
Altough you will have a hard time finding English translation for this movie so Metastaze might be good replacement for it, so backstory for metastaze is a life of army veteran with ptsp that is also football hooligan and fairly racist
I didn't like it that much
It really could have been much more
Perhaps I was expecting something different
So all of them

Nagel Eisen
Ill take Merkel just to see what she can do with her famed German discipline
I love that it is an inflected language and that word order is almost meaningless
The subject and predicate can go wherever in the sentence and the meaning will not be lost
In the same vein, I love the lack of articles and not having to think about whether the "the" before "subject" in the above paragraph is sufficient or maybe "predicate" is missing one of its own
In Croatian there just wouldn't be any
How fucked the grammar is
Our swear words
Though, you can expect pretty much any european to say this about their language
Though we're special because we swear at anyhting and everyithing
It's just a good anger language
The urban Zagreb way of speaking (Zagreboi here)
I adore my dialect cause it's a combo of Italian and Croatian, it's hard to understand for other Croatians
Could you give any examples
Pretty please
Exactly, I hate whenever the verb in German is placed in the end of the sentence because the sentence can sometimes be a mile long and you won't be able to connect half of the words before reading the predicate which is u pički materini
In day to day speech most people will follow SVO order which seems to be most natural one, but if you choose to change the order in one sentence you don't have to keep doing that
Order changing is usually used to emphasize something
Of course ordering words completely differently in every sentence would be super weird
Think of it this way, if I say for example: "Grandma killed grandpa" (Baka je ubila djeda), the emphasis is on the killer, but if I put Grandpa first in the sentence then we are finding out the victim
In English you would have to you use passive voice, in Croatian you just say: "Grandpa (was) killed (by) grandma" (Djeda je ubila baka) and it still means the same thing because of grandma being in nominative case which depicts subject and grandpa being in accusative case that says this is the object
Regarding poetry, I think loose word order does help but Croatian has a significantly smaller word count than English for example, so I'd think that represents a limitation as well
Also I'm not very knowledgeable about poetry so please take this with a grain of salt
If I were to guess the meaning purely going by Croatian meaning of the most similar words, it would be: Old woman gives/gifts food to knight bandit
In Croatian: vitez - knight, razbojnik - bandit
Actual meaning of your sentence translated into Croatian would be: Baba daruje hranu hrabrom ratniku
I have to say, I always knew Romanian was super interesting because of the Romance Slavic blend, but seeing it this way, I love it even more
Sorry for the long post, I got really excited
This is super fascinating, I'm dying to see what else can you come up with
[Hladetina]
Basically pork soup with veggies which is cooled down to a temperature in which you can cut it
People put all kinds of things in it, so you can often see chicken legs just kinda poking out of a jelly soup
It truly can and should, go fuck itself
Also, some would say, [fileki or tripice]
Which is a stew made out of animal stomachs
Very controversial, you are either the biggest fan or you hate them
I never met a person under the age of 60 that likes hladetina
I hope it goes to the garbage bin of history
My mom loves tripe
Also, jebes hladetinu koj kurac
I live here and and from SE Europe and fully agree
Also, beans are not breakfast food
Fight me
Isn't ayran just
a type of yoghurt
Maybe we just have bootleg stuff over here so I didn't taste the real deal, idk
People eat frog legs in parts of Croatia too
I tried them once, they're alright
Nothing special really

Can you make a good steak
How are your apple pie skills
Honestly I think steaks are overrated
What I like is veal in some goulash, or sauce slowly cooked
Here in croatia beef is everytjing from older cow and it's not that popular
Everyone uses it, and it can be spelled like OK/Ok (most common), okay, okej or oke
Hahahaha oke I like how you added “In Serbia” so the teacher doesn’t notice you copied
Oh shit, where do i even start
WW2 is coming and when the time comes be weary of Ante Pavelic and his Ustase, they'll bring only bad things
Also dont be crazy and form a country with your neighbours, it's not gonna work out well for neither one of you
Oh man
You should sit down, it’s quite a long story
Long story short
Lots of bloodshed
Croatia
>while the soviet occupation wasn't as bad as the nazi occupation, **it came close**
Let's not
Of course the Soviet occupation was terrible for Poland socially and economically
But to say it was **"close"** to the Nazi one that planned a total eradication of Poles as an ethnic group is just dumb
It always saddens me how Dubrovnik is known as "that Game of Thrones city" and not as the historically independent city-state which has:
a) built one of the oldest European pharmacies and [orphanages] and 15
century)
b) [inventor and the home of the first quarantine]
c) one of the first states to [ban the slave trade in modern times]
d) one of the first states to [have officially recognised the US]
As it was incredibly wealthy and art-oriented, Venice considered Dubrovnik as its Adriatic cultural rival
There are still poets and artists that have been born in the region claimed by Italians as theirs
Those are just some interesting facts, I am sure Croatians could continue the list
Dubrovnik used to be a dominant trade and art republic before the Americas were discovered
I believe the whole east of the country is often overlooked with cities like Varaždin and Osijek with rich history and interesting facts
For example Osijek has the first tram in Croatia and the first national Theatre
Also the Zagreb national theatre was inspired by the Osijek one
It also has the first Croatian beer dating from the mid 17th century
Varaždin was the original capital of Croatia and it was replaced because of the big fire there in the late 18th century
Vinkovci are considered by some historians as the oldest town in the world(probably not true but might be) and two Roman emperors were born there
Vinča culture, as Europe's most overlooked ancient civilisation, which had an alphabet and developed machinery way before most others, deserves its own thread
I really wish it gets more prominent and pushes out the whole "Rome and Greece created Europe" narrative out of our textbooks
The word, yes, but the concept originates from Dubrovnik, the Venetians just elongated it from 30 to 40 days

[The quarantena followed the trentino, or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1347 in the Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia)
No single letter names
Iž is (i think) the only two letter
Three is more common
Some weirder threes are Krk or Srđ
We have an island named Iž, but no places with one or two letters
We have a ton of places with three letters, though
Ulm wc when
My favourite three letter names would be places like Sinj, which look like it's four letters, but isn't haha
I guess
In croatian that sound is usually represented by "krc" but i guess this works too
First and last k are pronounced the same
Would that be a peninsula then
I speak italian and the easiest one was spanish followed by french, the others were rather hard (whats up with romanian and all those diacritics
In new Croatian translation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, "Baggins" will be literally translated as "Torbar" (one who makes and/or sells bags)
What are some of your countires translations of popular characters or names that might seem strange/weird/unnecessary
I feel it's more foreign to me
Well I'm not touched because I'm convinced it's all rebuildable and restorable
I know it will not be the original but many historic buildings are not the same version as they were first built
Now if somebody were to tell me that is not so, then I'd feel devastated
Also I'd feel angry if i were to find out it was not an accident
Last time it happened in 2017
The biggest company in Croatia - Agrokor, became too indebted and couldn't service its debts
To save 50
000 jobs and half of economy connected to Agrokor (biggest retailer in the country, distributor of Croatian agriculture products, food sector etc
) the government decided to introduce a law which took over the company from its owner and gave it to hastily made "comission" to implement whatever necessary to continue with work and find solution with creditors and debtors
Minister of finance used to be highly ranked Agrokor board member
Junior partner demanded that said minister (from senior partner of coalition) should be removed from the government
The PM said no, and live during session of the government all junior party ministers were removed from the session
Everyone expected elections after the [fall of government] but the senior party found enough support among 'independent' MP's, minority MP's and few smaller parties to continue governing alone after winning a vote of confidence in parliament by a one-vote margin
The same senior and junior party already participated in collapse of their own government a year prior to it
[That one] was result of meltdown in coalition that started with an affair about transparency surrounding sale of our national oil company to Hungarian MOL
How can you write about Croatian government collapses and forget about Orešković. I still can't believe we had a Canadian prime minister
Bosnia would like to have a word
You are expected to be proficient in english (since that is the main language for outside communication)
In the coast, italian is also prevalent, while in the inside german takes its place
Tourist workers on the coast can profit much by knowing any (other) language
Of course, this is all for under 30-40 people
Older folk are mostly german/italian with some russian
And no, im not counting serbian/bosnian/montenegrin as separate languages to know ;P
In Croatia you are taught English from kindergarten all the way to last year of high school
Also English is one of 3 obligatory exams you need to pass to finish high school (Croatian (language + literature), Maths and first language which is almost exclusively English
You can also take any number of other exams if anybody's wondering)
In simpler terms English/1st foreign language is 3rd most important subject
Personally I cannot fathom not learning a foreign language in school, it's a norm here
Most high schools also have second foreign language as a subject, depending on part of country it's mostly German or Italian, but can be French as well
So yeah, learning languages is pretty important in Croatia
so no spanish
I somehow expected spanish to be taught in portugal
I find that really weird, since hungarian is so disconnected from any nearby language (pretty much no common words or roots), so expecting people to be able to converse in hungarian seems so strange
I am always astounded when I see a slovene person (usually football players/coaches or singers) speaking more or less perfect croatian with journalists
I don't think I could hold a basic conversation in slovene, even though I live like 30 km from the boder
Depends on part of country
If you're in East or Central Croatia people will most likely know English and German, on ckast English and Italian
Almost everyone knows at least 1 foreign language
if its any consolation, hungarian is also very hard for us non-hungarians
Thats what I mean
If you offered me 4 choices for kosilo, i would have no idea what that means
And somehow slovenes are more fluent in croatian than vice versa
i mostly remember being frustrated not so much with the number of cases, but their specificity and weird ways to translate them in english
Like difference between running behind the house (from elsewhere to there) running behind the house (fully there) or running behind the house (starting there but not ending there)
Hell
Even though our foods are similar, bosnians always seem to make them taste so much better
**Slovenia and Hungary** \- I always respected how, in terms of politics, they seemed to have their stuff together way more than us
Less corruption, better organisation
I am speaking in past tense because not sure if that can be applied to Hungary now with Orbans administration
**Bosnia -** If we take pride in hospitality, we can shy in the shade of Bosnian one
Also, incredibly resilient people
**Serbia -** This has to be said, when compared to Serbians, our sense of humour sounds like a tired dry boomer who is done with life
Also, sligtly connected to that, their movie culture trumps ours I would say any day
**Montenegro** \- Absolute masters of not giving a fuck
Honorary **Macedonia** even though they are not neighbours - food and music
Serbia: Turbofolk reeks of irony, I love it
BiH: Feed me more čevapi
Montenegro: Thank you for creating Euro Neuro and Balkan Boj
Hungary: die (I feel like I have to put an obvious disclaimer that this is a joke given our history together
You can't have Croatia without Hungary and the other way around, otherwise thank you for teaching my mom to put black beer into goulash it is very tasty)
Slovenia: Gorenje (Fuck Iskra I have an Iskra toaster that shit broke in like 2 months you can suck my dick Iskra fuck you Iskra god I hate Iskra)
Chill
I always thought we have 0 chill as stubborn, hot-headed Balkaners
Too true
It's our cat nip
You open a bag of Vegeta and we all come running
As someone who worked in a store I'll say it's very stupid of costumers to assume that I, the person who just puts things on the shelves has personally tasted all the wines and champagnes and can give you an expert opinion on which to buy
Funilly enough, the Czecch republic will always remain my favourite for exactly the same reason - the people
They seemed to have the work ethic/organization of a western European country, but Slavic chillness and friendlieness
Absolutely perfect combo
Yeah when you work in a store that sells those kinds of things exclusively you should get a basic training on it
But I was working in a regular supermarket and idk expecting me to know everything about everything that's being sold there is kinda dumb
Really
I who's official job description was warehouse worker should know every single thing about every item being sold in a giant store, rather than you simply educating yourself on what you want to buy
Please
Besides supermarkets are self service stores
You doing it all on your own is the entire point

Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia is very popular among tourists
It is something different compared to traditional museums
Uffizi is surreal
The whole Florence is surreal
My advice: if you ever visit, get the Florence Card and visit as much museums as you can
I really liked the Beer Museum and the LEGO Museum in Prague
Something different and unique
I always try to learn at least how to say “Hello, do you speak English
” in the local language when I travel somewhere
I think it’s common courtesy to at least greet in the local language
I really don’t mind if a foreigner just says hello in my language and even if they do only that, I’ll know by pronounciation they’re not native Croatian speakers
I visited Do once and can confirm that "anyone who tries speaking Danish needs all available encouragement" is definitely a mood
i think the post was more about tourists that come to russia or people learning russian that try their best to speak russian and make a lot of mistakes not the people who can only say "нет сука, да водка" or some shit
I was, multiple times but I wasn't salty about it as everything else was 10/10 in terms of hospitality so it was easily forgiven (this is a massive compliment when it comes from a Balkanese)
Although I am from the continent, I very strongly associate that salty air smell you get from the sea with Croatia
Add to that some rakija maybe and a slowly cooked stew/sauce like pasticada dish and you'd get the Croatia smell
In 1991 Croatia had 4
784
265 people that lived here
In mid-2018 it had 4
087
843 people living here
The number of people that live outside Croatia is almost the same as the number of people that live inside Croatia and growing
It doesn't feel really good
A lot of my friends have left for Germany, Ireland or America
Most of my family (from my fathers side) live in Germany or America
We have also found out that my grandma's niece (I think) that lives in Germany has Covid-19 along with her pregnant daughter
She has cried a lot but has not been able to see her, just talk to her, from thousands of kilometers away
Losing friends, losing family
All in all it doesn't feel really good
Well here the first grade is like you and about 25-30 classmates and then the eighth grade is like you and 13-18 classmates
The population of Croatia in 1990 was around 4
7 million
The population now is around 4 million, more likely to be 3
9 than 4
I was born and live in the country's capital Zagreb which hasn't really experienced a decrease of population but rather a small slow growth
But even so  , I have recently started noticing that there is really a lot of old people around
I go for a walk and realize that the most of the people at the central square are older people
Now, if I notice this in the capital and the largest city (around 800 000 people) then you can just imagine how it looks in smaller towns or villages
It really is horrible
Also, of course, this has a really bad impact on the economy
Apart from the real pensioners there is I think around 500 000 of people that get their pension because they were in the war
If you look up the details, at its peak the Croatian military had around 90 000 active personnel so the 500 000 people is really inflated
This happens because the only condition for getting a pension like that is to have two eye witnesses, you can see how this might work
And even with 700 000 people less than 30 years ago Croatia still has 145 000 of unemployed people which is going to get a lot worse this year because tourism forms around  40% of our economy
I could keep going about the corruption but it is all just sad really
Unfortunately not anymore
These days in Croatia, young people and whole young families are moving away
Even people with steady income jobs move away simply because of salary/work conditions
For example, lots of nurses and medicinal doctors leave for Germany or UK because their starting salary there is way higher than here (even adjusted to standard of living) with better working conditions
So we are now losing people left and right
In places where it has been legalised it has lowered crime rates, so I'm all for it
Also it has a lot of medical uses
I used to belive the entirety of Yugoslavia was only in Croatia's modern borders
Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, BaH, Montenegro and Macedonia all in Croatia
I first encountered Prussia in an Extra History series
I confronted my history teacher like "Yo what's this Prussia thing and what's their deal". We hadn't gotten to Prussia yet at that point,
Barcelona - Edinburgh - Vienna - Dubrovnik - Valletta
Ummm less touristic and Dubrovnik can’t really go in the same sentence
it’s like the tourist town of Croatia heh
Still a great place to visit tho
Yeah Dubrovnik is a lot smaller so tourists basically overrun the place, especially in July/August
They finally started to try and limit cruisers allowed in the port so that should help in the future, as well the people allowed in the main centre so that you can actually enjoy the visit and not just be annoyed at the crowds

I wish I could just forget what happened to my family in the 90s, if only
I feel for both girls
But props to you for being so polite and open to knowing about it
: )
I found it funny when my native speaking Slovak teacher who was learning Croatian didn't know how NOT to devoice the final consonant
Thus 'trg' (town square) sounded like 'trk' (running)
But a well known warning to Croats travelling to Czech Republic is not to adress women/girls as 'cura' (girl, girlfriend in Croatian) as it's very similar to 'coura' (whore in Czech)
Hahahahahah I also had no idea that "trudna" is tired in slovenian, until now
Damn
"i" means "and", "nj" (nj is one letter) means "(for) her", "o" means "about" and in some cases can mean "by", "u" means "in", "k" means "to" and we also have "a" which is a form of "and" and my dialect also has "z" which means "from"
In Croatian:
s=with
k=towards
u=in
a=but(not exactly, but really close)
i=and
o=about
That's all we got :)
Very similar
Although i is just and and a is just also
u is in instead of v (unless you're kajkavian), from is iz so not a one letter word, o is the same near is not a one letter word here

In Croatia, at least where I live, it is seen as showing of
People generally, if they know where and for who you work, can assume how much you earn
If you work for the government, on any level, your salary info is publicly available if you know where to look
Since we grow olives here the split is almost 50-50
It leans slightly more toward green olives but barely from what I see
Reading this makes me want to work at ESA even more
Though of course it falls into the usual European pitfall of not explaining itself very well
Well, I still have a looong way
I am now entering my last year of primary school (8th grade) And I will make sure my back is therally broken from work
Yes, children from very young age walk alone to school (8-9 years old)
Or take the bus if school is not in walkable distance
Also, a lot of times children live close by so they go to school together
And they also play outside without parents watching over them
In my 27 years I dont remember one single incident and I live in the capital, in "big" city like you said
Yes, in first semester of first grade, maybe the entire first year depending how close to the school they live, they get escorted by parent, but then you're on your own
And school buses aren't really a thing in cities (they exist only in more wide spread, rural areas)
They tend to use double negative and often leave out a/an
Same in croatian - aktualno
Never heard anyone mixing that though, I just hear people throwing in the word in English into a Croatian sentence, like "frajer je to actually napravio" (which still technically doesn't 100% fit, they basically replace zapravo with stvarno)
There is one other word that I personally mix that I can't remember right now, damn it
Edit: saw a comment below, it's eventually and eventualno
Visited Vienna with a few friends, came to our hotel
Turns out the receptionist is a Croat
Nice, I think
We walk into the lift with two guys from hotel maintenance
Turns out one of them is Bosniak when he heard us speak
2 hours later at dinner, waiter overhears us talking, says hello, asks how things are going, what brings us here
In Serbian
Goddamn Yugos everywhere
Yup pretty much what I've found over the years
Also construction, but that's more of a stereotype about Gastarbeiter in Germany
Yes, Croatia does issue ID cards which are compulsory after the age of 18, but it is possible to get them earlier
[Front side]
[Back side]
Ngl I hate the design
Yeah, like confirming your identity with mail with your name on or your bank card
So weird
Here, you have to have it on your person at all times as police can stop to "legitimize" you at any moment and not being able to provide an identification is a punishable offense
I mean if you're just waking your dog or going to the shop no one is going to bother you but at larger gatherings it's a must
Hmm, yours are kinda similar to ours
Polish ID's also have parents' names IIRC
Seeing other countries IDs ours (Croatian) is pretty good looking and readable
It's madatory to make an ID at 16 years of age and have some form of formal identification with you at all times
Also our ID serves as a passport for every other EU memeber, EEA members, Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo
Sterted im kindergarten when I was 3
English being present everywhere and having such simple grammar made it really easy to learn
Started learning when I was 6, by the time I was 12 I could fully understand and decently speak, around 13-14 I would say I became fluent, and then when I was 15 I was at the point where I spoke more English than Croatian (my native language)
I learned mostly just by watching an absurd amount of videos, and school only helped me with maybe grammar (tenses, word forms, etc)
School for theory
Books, TV and games for vocabulary
It helps that I read a lot, and waiting to get most books in translated edition is ... terrible
started learning at around 4 at home because my family knew it would be useful, I learned to read early and my grandmother used to be an English teacher
However I only started rapidly improving after I started using internet at around 12/13
I just watched a lot of english channels on TV like Cartoon Network, Boomerang, Nickelodeon(spongebob mostly) and youtube when I first discovered it
Now I am almost 15 and my english is almost on the C-1 level but I still got new words to learn and I need experience and my mom teaches english and german in high school so that helped too
Improved by reading, watching movies, reddit and videogames
I went on an youth exchange under the Erasmus+ programme in Sarikamis, Turkey
It isn't exactly strange but it was exotic so to say
oh man, i'd say i'm pretty good at it, being from a tourist popular place in croatia
i don't mean to offend anyone but the stereotypes are kinda true, most of the time, that is
Just to name few:
**Germans**: if old then they can be seen on a beach, always (and i mean always) on a chair or something like that, under an umbrella, very red and sun burnt
if they're fat AND tattooed then they're germans for sure
wearing birknestocks since before they were cool (and one of the reasons i still refuse to wear anything similar to it, it reminds me of old germans)
if young then driving a golf 5 and listening to loud music
usually having fun and coming in groups of 5 to 10 people
i always had fun while hanging with germans
**Italians**: usually very very loud
men wear shorts that definitely couldn't fit them since the elementary school
they like playing sports, usually decent in football but terrible in basketball
but what they lack in technique they compensate with heart and stamina
i mean they're all over the place, hard to keep up
**Czech/Slovak**: usually in families of 4, they like to rent a small boat and act as a captain for the duration of their stay, like to go around on small islands rather than staying on a single place
the running joke in croatia is about czech people getting lost on a mountain in flip flops and/or at sea on an air mattress
because that happened
more than few times
i'll just say that they're adventurous
**Slovenes**: they're in a camper or on a bike
Also adventurous but a bit smarter and more prepared than the former
if you see someone who looks like he took a wrong turn from giro d'italia it's probably a slovene, either with a car with 5 bikes on it or on a bike in full race gear
**English**: if not a festival season then usually completely red, ginger hair and burnt to a crisp
usually polite (i know people complain about them but tbh, i never had any problems with them) but sticking to themselves (as opposed to germans who want to hang out with anyone)
if festival season then stumbling around the town half naked or dressed like from that tv show [the tribe] around 6 in the morning or puffing those little bottles on the sidewalk
really friendly while they're still half conscious but that must be the drugs
**Serbian**: usually come in groups of 2 families or solo if they have a family member living in the area
they can be seen in a beach bar, loudly talking and drinking
the poorest of the bunch but by far the most generous
**The Dutch**: haven't seen them much, they're usually hanging out on campsites with slovenes, driving audi station wagons with bikes on top of it
EDIT: oh also i'd like to add that if i go to another country, i can always tell when someone's croatian (or serbian or bosnian)
i can't explain how, it's just you see that person or a group and it's like they don't belong there
we pop out like popcorn
the further the better, of course
aw man
thats so nice
Why not soy and tofu
"Maćij kašalj" translates to "A cats cough" means "A piece of cake"
We do
It is called [Institut za hrvatski jezik i jezikoslovlje]
The Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics is the central national scientific institution for the research of the Croatian language and general linguistics
We also have [Matica hrvatska]
Matica hrvatska was founded in 1842 with the purpose of promoting national and cultural identity in the fields of artistic, scientific and spiritual creativity, economy and public life, and care for social development
It is one of the largest and most important publishers of books and magazines in Croatia
Though this one is much more than just lamguage, it includes it in its "mission".
Serbs definitely have their own institute
As far as I know, they do not cooperate that much
Since the languages may be similar but, the rules of writing are pretty different
Just to note here, in the past the languages were much more diverse than today
It is not the other way around
They came closer over the years
The example is the so called bosnian language where they use **everything**. They accept all the rules from both serbian and croatian
They accept both vocabularies and both accents
So in a nutshell, bosnian is what yugoslavian laguages was aimed to be
They managed to create it, just not in every country
[The only cooperation between the two] I could find after 1850
This shows how eager they were to create one language out of it
Forcing such agenda has caused issues afterwards
Edit: Also [this] I have just found this and think it is an interesting read
You could do a bit of research on this topic as it is fascinating one (at least to me) and it shows how much politics plays a role in everyday life
You be the judge of what you read and find
Good luck hahah
Well, overall they do fall into the same category
Just like Czech and Slovak, or to an extent like Danish and Norwegian
To me, as a native, they sound different and you definitely know where does someone come from when they start to speak
I hear the biggest difference in the accent (serbian being much stronger and harsher, at least to my ear), vocabulary (nouns tend to be different and the names for things, places and people), suffisex (exmp
: kontroli*sati* and kontroli*rati*) and lastly usage of "-e" (in serbian) and "-ije, -je, -i" (in croatian)
For an example:
- **pretty/nice** > l*e*po (serbian) - l*ije*po (croatian)
- **time/weather** > vr*e*me (serbian) - vr*ije*me (croatian
... and so on
Those are the basics, pretty much
In a nutshell, as much as they are same or similar, we cannot hide where do we come from when we start to speak
Everyone hears those differences I wrote here
That is the best I can explain haha
Or ~~Piran~~ *
For artists that are still alive and popular, I would recommend Gibonni
There is this man who died months ago, he's from south of Croatia and every Croat knows about him, but i would like everyone to know what a good singer that guy was
Here is the link to one of his songs
Well, I just answered that question in another thread, so I'll just paste it here
I don't really listen to metal, but I think there are some great rock bands in Croatia that are kinda big here but not really internationally
I'll list them here with links to the song i like the most of them
[Aerodrom - Digni me visoko]
[Azra - Lijepe žene prolaze kroz grad ]
[Kojoti - Trese, lupa, udara]
[ITD BAND - Elena]
[Atomsko Sklonište - Pomorac sam majko]
[Neki to vole vruće - California]
[Film - Sjećam se prvog poljupca]
[Bajaga - Dvadeseti Vek]
[Neno Belan / Đavoli - Stojin na kantunu]
[Parni Valjak - U prolazu]
[BOA - Svi tvoji poljupci]
[Bijelo Dugme - Ako ima Boga]
[Jinx - Smijem se ]
[Električni Orgazam - Igra rokenrol cela Jugoslavija]
[Kerber - Hajde da se volimo ]
[Prljavo Kazalište - Kiše jesenje]
Yes, I know there are some Serbian artists as well on this list, but this seemed like a great chance to introduce some people to rock'n'roll music from my and neighbouring countries as well
Enjoy
It was extremely popular in Croatia as well (for rock listeners), the original Hungarian version
Zagreb- Split
That thing is another level
Cars with ZG plates when derby is being played end up damaged
Same goes for ST cars around Makismir venue in Zagreb
Just google Bad Blue Boys- Torcida rivarly but it's mostly capital city vs second biggest city in a country
Can you explain term *vesničan*?
My sick mind tells me that term comes from Vesna, slavic goddess so you are calling them backwards villagers
I'm probably wrong
Agree
Its coast vs inland, "lazy appartment owners who get their money from tourists during three months in summer" vs "hard working continentals", sea vs skiing, italy vs germany
I was waiting for someone to mention it
True, we were just jealous at them, now we earn as much as them in 2 months time while advent is active
Thanks for an explaination
he didn't say unification with whom
Yes
Let's take Shrek for example
In the Croatian dubbed version, Shrek has a Dalmatian accent, Donkey has a Northern/Zagreb accent and uses a lot of slang words, Fiona and her parents speak the perfect standard Croatian language, while sometimes Fiona uses a few words that are frequent in Zagreb
It's basically like this: strong accent in the original - Dalmatian dubbed/ "cool" or "teenlike" - Zagreb/ fancy - standard Croatian with the perfect pronunciation
The Dalmatian accent is used with characters that inhabit or are close to the sea or another body of water (for example in Finding Nemo or Spongebob; the fish and sea creatures have a Dalmatian accent)
Sometimes the Zagorski accent as well, which works better for a farmer/hillbilly type of character
Zagreb pronunciation is definitely not "perfect standard" Croatian
The "Purger" accent has really bad intonation as opposed to standard Croatian
But I agree on the rest
Also, the accent from Zagorje is often used with village folk/hillbilly types of characters, like Tow Matter from Cars
I didn't say Zagreb pronunciation was perfect, I said the *standard* Croatian language was used for the perfect pronunciation
Donkey's pronunciation is far from perfect, even in the original movie
Edit: I rewrote the first comment, so there aren't any confusions
That's true, it does
Thanks to Venecian colonists, the Dalmatian people have picked up an Italian-sounding pronounciation and quite a bit of italian-derivative words
Ah, my mistake, I have the attention span of a fruit fly
Same, I get that haha
Yes, sometimes people don't even understand each other
We hava a lot of diversity in Kajkavian dialect
But a lot of it is dead because of Yugoslavia
They are called "cases" in english
To ti i govorim
Zašto pisati "padeži" ako postoji engleska riječ za to ("cases"), te ako pišeš na engleskom, piši do kraja na engleskom
Sve pet
I don't think any human being with a brain is blaming Poland for extermination camps, people are much more likely saying the death camps were in poland, not that the Polish controlled them
Its general knowledge that the Poles didn't control the Jewish death camps, and when you say "Polish death camps" you know people are talking about Nazi death camps located in Poland, this is general knowledge
Saying "Polish death camps" should be perfectly clear to anyone above the age of 12 that it wasn't the Polish in control of those camps
I never said people are born with this knowledge but almost every human on earth knows this
Tehnička kultura - Technical education
It's a mandatory subject throughout the last 4 years of primary school
We basically learn how to draw blueprints, how to work with breadboards etc
In Croatia we do have 'religious education' but it is strictly Catholic and curriculum is mandated by the Vatican
in my opinion it is completely unconstitutional, no matter that it is not mandatory subject, it clashes with the idea of separation of state and church
In elementary school, there's'  no alternative to it but in high school, you must choose between something called Ethics and 'Religious education'
problem is that idea of reevaluating Religious education purpose in state-run schools is support almost taboo topic between both left and right party
Right-wing of course wholeheartedly support the thing but the left is too cowardly to make even lukewarm stance on it, tricky thing is then they should bring in the question of Vatican contracts under which R.E. is enforced in public schools, and much more and that is a whole big can of worms that again undermine constitution IMO and even sovereignty of Croatia as a country
How far the church has the reach in Croatia is fact that sex ed even euphemism as health education is still not subject in most of the schools
why, because it doesnt condemn homosexuality and propagate gender ideology or something
big NoNo for god-fearing people of Catholic Republic of Croatia
Sorry I just read the title of the post, saw Religion education and started ranting
The same is in Croatia
Gymnasiums have Latin as mandatory, and "classical" gymnasiums have ancient Greek as well
Plus the other two foreign languages (English  + another one) that are mandatory
Mostly grammar I'd say, but I really don't know
We have 8 years of primary school, and then 4 of high school where you choose between a gymnasium and a vocational school (some vocational schools for example like the ones for hairdressers and automehnaics last 3 years)
After that you have the Matura exam (only for gymnasiums and vocational schools that students attended in duration of 4 years
) Your Matura exam determines if you enroll at a uni or not
You have two levels, A and B, (high and basic level)
You don't have a name on your paper but a number so everything is fair and the teacher that corrects it (always from a different school) doesn't know who you are
Croatian, maths and a foreign language are mandatory, and you can choose other subjects depending on the faculty that you're applying for and what it wants
Slavonski Brod (Croatia) and Brod (B&H)
They are seperated by river Sava
Here in Croatia we have the town of Slavonski Brod on the river Sava
On the other side of the river, in Bosnia and Herzegovina lies the Bosanski Brod
In Yugoslavia this was a single town which had around 90 000 inhabitants, a bridge still exists but it is just a border crossing
There are a lot of problems there because Bosnia has an old oil refinery on their side that is polluting a lot but the people of Slavonski Brod can't do much about it because the refinery is in an other state
Stara Gradiška (Croatia) and Gradiška (Bosnia), Hrvatska Kostajnica (Croatia) and Kostajnica (Bosnia), Hrvatska Dubica (Croatia) and Kozarska Dubica (Bosnia)
and many more hahaha
Yup
I just mentioned these two as a most famous example
Yeah, it is the biggest one that is split if I am not mistaken
I just wanted to add some more to the list
Edit: interestingly enough, all of them are split with Bosnia and on the rivers Sava and Una
Hmmm
Croatian history and Serbian history from 1940-1995 are 2 differerent stories with no similarities
Well I think for us it is obvious
1991-1995
The world calls it "Yugoslav wars", we call it "Patriotic War",l and "Independace War". Also we do not agree with the Serbs as they say they were the victims and were chased out of their homes, and we say they raised a rebellion, slaughter their neighbours and friends and cut off one part of the country from the rest and occupied it for 5 years
You can see how this can be a point of different believes and views
*(Not aimed to offend anyone)*
He's viewed as bringing modern infrastructure and liberty to Croatia so we kinda adore him
Well you could also add to that the King of Yugoslavia's dictatorship
Serbs see it as he was merely trying to keep the country together and was doing his best to just repel the opposition and rebellion
But, Croatia views it as border totalitarism and a way to supress other nations who are not Serbs (Slovenes, Croats and Bosniaks)
Even before that
All the way from 1918 up to 1999
Though even today there is the question of Kosovo
Is it a country
Is it not a country
Yes, that is correct
You don't have to think anymore, now you know it is true
Kind of and kind of not cause he took the Ragusa Republic down
So, he us not adored, but not hated either
We see the benefits he brought with him
Slovaks and Czechs understand eachother as well
However the argument may be for the languages, imo it is for the best we keep them seperated as they have been and still are developing under different circumstances
Those who rebelled were in fact "the bad guys". Almost in every sense of the word
Indeed, Orthodox Croatians
They like to call themselves "Serbs" (whatever that may be) for some reason unknown to the universe
Wait there are people that don't have home clothes
Oh my god don't even get me started
Cavoglave - patriotic song from Croatian homeland war with Serbia
We sing it very often, and Serbs dont like it
Some of the lyrics:
-Listen you, band of serbian volunteer guerillas,
Our revenge will get you even in Serbia
-Fire your Tompson, Kalashnikov and Zbrojovka
Throw grenade, chase the gang trough the spring
Jasenovac i Gradiška stara
Tbh there is more, I would say communist songs might piss off the right wing quite easily, as much as some war-related songs (Cavoglave most notably) would trigger the left
I don't hear anyone sane in Croatia singing it
Yes that would be the guy
Bojna Čavoglave
Well I mostly play Hoi4 and never vanilla
So I play whatever I feel like
But as for the country with which I've had the most fun
Hands down *unsavoury* Germany in UMC
Appatently it's Gornje Mrzlo Polje Mrežničko, which means Upper Cold Mrežnica Field
Mrežnica's a river in central Croatia
It took me about an hour to learn how to pronounce it semi-fluently, and now I'm just waiting for an opportunity to flex on everyone with it
And of course, yearly competitions to see who can perfectly pronounce it
And the jury are native Welshmen
Pecs Hungary or Sombor Serbia not really sure where to go first
Btw Sombor has great food and cheap shoes and Pecs is just beatiful itself
Monaco
Very pretty but I’d imagine it’d get boring quite fast
We were only there for a few hours though
lmao, I felt the same when I was there
Alaska, I would've said russia or ukraine but I see them quite often
Can't remember if it was Bahrein or Qatar, saw it on highway a couple of months ago when driving home after work
Struck me as something you don't see that often in these parts
I've seen a couple of American license plates (New Jersey, Massachusetts and California), Canadian one (Ontario) and an Icelandic one
We say "at" (but pronounce it like et) and "monkey" (manki)
Its monkey (not even translated)
I dont think we have "native language" name
If you are giving your adress you either say at or monkey
"Monkey" used to be more popular before, now "at" is used
We also say monkey or "at"
Yeah, we also say either “monkey” or “at” in Croatia
Usually for the underdog
In any other case: ex-YU countries, Poland or Ireland
I don't  watch football religiously
Only time I did was World Cup 2018
Croatia
Either Serbia, Bosnia, Slovenia
Ireland (great buncha lads)
Italy
Germany, Poland or Ireland
Croatia
Ex-Yu countries, Ex-AH countries, rest of Balkan countries, Germany, Poland, Ireland
Rest of slavic countries
Rest of Europe
South American countries, Japan, Korea
Rest of the world
You are welcome
Aww, warms my heart
I love you too
Ireland, great bunch of lads
That's our brat
aww <3
Can I just ask you from a greek viewpoint: which countries do you consider Southern/Mediterranean European countries
Poor countries tend to have population growth
Working hours in France
In Croatia, I am used to pretty much everything being open from 8 to 20 on week days, with shops and stores working entire saturdays and even sundays for most of the time
Then I went to France (Orleans and nearby area) for a year and had to take a day off every time i needed to go to the bank or post office because their hours matched mine perfectly
My lunch break was theirs as well, and when my working hours ended so did theirs
I have no idea how and when people do administrative stuff without needing to miss work
Most bars closed before 20 on work days and 22 on weekends
Supermarkets had "now open 'til noon on saturday" banners, and pretty much nothing worked on sundays
I remember walking through the city centre with friends (from my country) one sunday around six pm, it was summer, sun was still high, and we were complaining how we couldnt do anything since stores were closed, caffes were closed, patiseries were closed, even public transport sucked
How much rice Portuguese people eat, compared to us Croatians
> small rural town of 80,000 people
We have different perspectives of what "small" and "rural" means
U from san marino
big fan of ur football national team me and my cousins always cheer like u won world cup when u score goal or when match is draw and thats how i feel about micronations
1 question why do you have so much airaoft guns in san marino
Croatia always has a soft spot for San Marino since the guy who made your country comes from one of our islands
Vatican we love because we are heavy catholic boys
For Luxembourg, my aunt works there but idk about other opinions
Liechtenstein is pretty neutral with us along with Andorra, Monaco has some of our sportsmen living there and Liberland is a joke, it doesn't exist
Madness
I honestly think that if they still had conscription and the general population had to send their children in the army overseas American top brass wouldn't dare to do half of the shit they feel comfortable doing these days
I mean what the fuck was this
Droning of a general and important political figurehead of a regional power and rival of an ally who is at the time in another country under diplomatic immunity
That's some Cold war bullshit, but nowadays they don't even care for pretense to use for example a proxy and the president of the United States gloats publicly on social media
They won't attack the US, but everyone will feel their response in a way
Closing the Strait of Hormuz looks like a logical answer and it would cause the price of fuel to skyrocket
The other thing to think about is that the killed general was funding, arming and coordinating shia militias not only in the ME but also on the Arab Peninsula, and that we can expect a lot of attacks in the region in the future
This attack also increases the instability in Iraq that is already close to another civil war
I'm afraid Europe could see a new refugee wave soon, and this time with even more people, and less cooperation from Turkey and NA countries that were Europes buffer zone for decades without us really noticing it
Ser-
Serbia
Serbia probably
Serbia
Nahhh we're pretty chill about you, you won't get Piranski tho
but where would we go skiing when the winter comes
Arriving ?
too casual
We do
The type of meal is called "gablec". Usually costs 25-35 kuna (3-5€) and it's something you can eat fast and get back to work with a full stomach
More often than not you eat it with a spoon
Students have their cafeterias, in which the food might not traditional (or edible sometimes), but it can get your stomach full for 0
8€. (soup, main meal, salad, desert)
Yeah we have something like that, but we dont have name for that kind of places
We call the meals ''gablec'' if you are from mainland or ''marenda'' if you are on the coast
Its usually cheap traditional food like 5 € for stews or some meat with potatoes, or fish and black risotto if on the coast
And you get little salad and some bread with it
Really depends on the place
What about Grinzing in Vienna
Isnt that basically the same
Homemade food in someone's home, at least a while back when i visited it
It was christmas, in 2000
I was 15 back then tho and i went with my parents so i dont know the prices
I never went back there anymore
I will go "Nocturno" by Oliver Dragojevic, a really dear song to me, its really sad too
[One and only ]
Dino Dvornik-Afrika
Oliver Dragojević-Trag u Beskraju, Cesarica
Gibonni-Libar
Azra-Balkan
Bijelo Dugme-Đurđevdan, Lipe Cvatu
Prljavo Kazalište- Marina, Heroj Ulice
Time-Time album is great
Gibonni if you want some good production
And this is not Croatian, but listen to this album:
Idoli- Odbrana i Poslednji Dani
And this artists:
Ekatarina Velika
S.A.R.S.
Bijelo Dugme
Not Serbian, but [this] is catchy as fuck
In my opinion  U boj U boj by Ivan Zajc (iirc)
Its a great song and I think it should be our anthem
dobra
Can you give me a link
I can't seem to find a video
I don't know
And I haven't read the books in Croatian, only English
>Were the movies dubbed in Croatian
Nope
We call it šalabahter, sometimes shortened to šalić. Apparently the word comes from the German word Scharteke, and that word comes from the French word charte
That could be true and my info could be wrong
When I googled etymology of the word šalabahter, šalabakter was written in parentheses next to it
So who knows
Unless something major changed in the last decade, no
Aside from (unlabeled) pegs for coats in some classrooms, nothing in both primary and secondary education
No lockers are really rare actually but last year lockers were brought for the 1st to 4th grade but not the others
We also took our shoes off throughout entire primary and secondary school
Though, we needed to have slippers or any other form of footwear to wear during the day at achool and would leave our shoes in a shoe rack and hang our coats above them
Those racks and hangs were always places just outside of a classroom and each grade had their own row assigned to them for that year
In High School we could wear the shoes inside and coats as well, though we did have a changing room where we could hang our coats if we wanted to
Other than that
nothing more
No lockers
Had to carry our books for that day (had a schedule) and bring them back home with us as well
Aslo we bring our notebooks with us at all times
If you didn't have your notebook for that specific subject you had that day, you would get a minus
3 minuses and you get an F (1 in croatian, cause grading system is 1-5)
Our hallways looked like [this] in High School
Also no lockers
The photos on the walls are from the previous generations that finished the same HS
Each class section (A, B, C, D and sometimes E) got one photo with all of their portraits and names under
Each class section has around 30 students at the beginning of the 1st HS grade (so 9th grade in German and English system)
At the end it always falls down to 20-25
Haha
We didn't leave our books at school
We had all of them at home and had a schedule for that day of which subjects we had (7-8 subjects per day) and carried books and notebooks for them that day to school
Then aftewards we would bring all that back home and switch them for the ones for tomorrow and put those in our backpack
In croatian:
Million = milijun
Billion = milijard
Trillion = trilijun
Quadrillion = kvadrilijun
Quintillion = kvintilijun
Croatian:
* 10^6   -> Milijun
* 10^9   -> Milijarda
* 10^12 -> Bilijun
* 10^15 -> Bilijarda
And it goes on with the same sufixes (Trili-, Kvadrili- etc
Like this:
-  -
︎ milijun (10^6 ) = million
︎milijarda (10^9 ) = billion
︎bilijun (10^12 ) = trillion
︎bilijarda (10^15 ) = Quadrillion
︎trilijun (10^18 ) = Quintillion
︎trilijarda (10^21 ) = Sextillion
︎kvadrilijun (10^24 ) = Septillion
︎kvadrilijarda (10^27 ) = Octillion
︎kvintilijun (10^30 ) - Nonillion
Yes
Zagreb has [it
] They even decorate the [tunnels ] for Christmas every year
It's quite beautiful
You can visit it legally at working hours
Otherwise it is closed after 10 I think, so it wouldn't get vandalized at night
Adriatic sea(sorry Italy, it is more beautiful on our side)
Red and white squares
Ive heard that our anthem is one of the most peaceful ones
It doesnt mention any kind of supremacy or greatness, just natural beauty
Our ability to sports
Iirc the Serbian football team coach said: "Why can't you play like the Croats
Not really
The only people I’ve seen do that are small kids
Croatia because I am biased, it makes no sense and looks like a dragon (from two perspectives)
Otherwise I like Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Iceland and Wyoming
Croatian borders kinda look like a bird stretching it's wings and I love it
This seems like something I would find in a Geography now video
I had a Bulgarian friend say to me that we should own Bosnia because the border fits so frustratingly well
It does, but we all know what disaster that would be
No, rectangle, perfectly balanced Wyoming
Why Wyoming over any other rectangle state, idk
Yes, I can tell apart North american accents from rest of the accents
To clarify I can tell if it's english, scottish, irish
Northern english sometimes sounding like scottish
I have a hard time separating South african from english or australian
I always think what part of british isles is that
On the other side I can't tell apart canadian from american unless american speaks southern accent or I hear that canadian deep accent in a word *about*
Definitely
Also, I understand Slav English better than native speakers
My guess is we sometimes do very specific grammar errors when constructing sentences, which make sense if you translate them to one of the Slav languages but on English sound like incoherent mess
I'm sure it's a thing for a lot of people, but I personally never met a non native that spoke English like a native
I've heard of this before, but can you give a video/audio example or something
And a written explanation lol
The only phrase with biting I heard here is "zagrist govno", "to bite the shit", but that one doesn't have anything to do with dying, it's used more in the sense of "suck it up and do something unpleasant".
The most commonly used slang phrases I heard about dying are "otegnuti papke", "to spread the hooves", or "odapeti", "to let loose (e.g. an arrow)"
We don't use it in a dying scenario, but in my area people often say "zagristi govno" (to bite the shit) when we have to swallow our pride and do something we are not proud of
Our history, position and unique balkan culture is something noone else in the world has
Hundreds of occupiers since the end of our kingdom in 1102, catholic church in the balkans and our general shape is weird and hard to manage with flat lands in the east, mountains in the middle and coastline in the west on such a weird and small Territory with diffrent style Croats all around it makes our country special
It is a miracle that all Croats now are united in one country(Herzegovina exception) together under one flag
I think that is most Slavs tbh, with Poles being a prime example
Does a Hungarian/Austrian grip come close
It's a very common misconception, but people of Dinaric Alps andd their respective countries are taller than the Dutch
Link please
>Cyprus is Greece too
Woof
Turks there too
>And, heh, Turkey is not European
Heh, it's as European as Russia
Istria
Croatia is pretty culturally diverse for such a small country but Istria is percieved as the most different one
Before 1945
it was never fully part of Croatia, they have noticable Italian minority and also a large percent of population from less developed ex-Yu countries
Therefore they have the strongest regional identity and many of them are Istrians first and Croats second (also on the last census more than 10% of population declared as Istrians which is unheard of in rest of the country)
It's the most developed and least nationalistic region as a whole, their regional party rules in almost every county they run for office and left wing parties win more than 70% of votes in every elections
Love it of hate it it is the odd one out in many aspects
Međimurje in the north of Croatia
Zadar man is our Florida man iirc
Funny how Greeks literally had the same statement
That is a slighty controversial topic but imho native Istrian Croats and Italians aside, a large portion of people pushing hard for Istrian identity are second or third generation Serbs, Bosniaks, Montegrins etc
who find it much easier to identify with non-national Istrian identity rather than Croatian one because of our shared history with those groups
Considering Istria is more liberal and left wing then rest of the country it certainly makes sense for them to do that
Not trying to count blood cells of other people but this is how I understand this topic after talking with some of my Istrian friends from university
No, we istrians hate tourists
We actually flay them on the main square every second sunday in a month and during the full moon
There's a way around it tho, many tourists who want to visit istria disguise themselves as deaf and mute locals, that way they can enjoy the sea and nature without exposing themselves with foreign language
You better not be asian or black tho because we dont have those in istria and we'll be able to see through your disguise
The other way is to learn "bo". Its only used in istria and it means "i dont know". You pronounce it quick and fast, like in "turBO". Whenever someone asks you something you just say "bo" and go away, you'll be safe
There is a Hungarian minority there but the [Burgenland Croats] are more numerous
How the hell did albanians get there
I agree
Dont know much about Croatian and Serbian youtubers but they’re not much different
All of them are equally bad
Well I love it
I think ours is ok
A much better alternative imo is U boj U boj from the Nikola Šubić Zrinski opera
It just makes me more patriotic and willing to fight for my country
Isnt that an anthems job
Eh, I personally don't like it, it's too slow and boring - I feel like "U boj, u boj
" from the Nikola Šubić Zrinski opera sounds better and more bombastic, as well as more patriotic
Maybe change up a few of the lyrics to fit and it would be a pretty nice anthem
I really like it
It is just the hymn to Croatian beauty and people's devotion to it which I think fits it just fine
Boring
Just boring
Himna Slobode was better
Your anthem should be the EU anthem ngl
I think a good joke anthem is hej brigade, maybe change up the lyrics a little
I didnt know that, that's sweet
Pretty sure it made the queen immortal
GDR anthem is like 10 times better and more representative of Germany imo
We kinda copypasted it for Yugo's anthem, but we dont need to talk about that
Which one is about wars and fights
The only one that comes to mind is the french one and thats it
Croatian anthem is called "Our Beautiful" and it sings about how Croatia is beautiful and thats it
East asians are for some reason fascinated with us
Here we have this and some koreans lesrning croatian for a play i mean what are they gonna do next
Well doesn't seem especially socialist
It sings of prosperity and a new identity and the word people i sonly mentioned twice iirc
A cry for help, in time of need, await relief, from apple league
I mean "whom" has a proper function, its not interchangeable with "who"
Well, we had people thrown out carried by arms and legs, phsyical fights, people bringing plane toys just to wind up other representatives, shouting, the few that actually come to the parliament sessions just look at their phones
UKs ia definately not civilaised but croatian isn't much better
Honestly, if they were deciding on something like Brexit it would be a shitshow
Lol watch Croatian or Kosovo parliament,that shit is on another level of uncivilized
Lets not forget that time when one of the reps brought female thong and high heels as a gift to the government during the vote about the Istanbul convention
What was the deal with the plane toys
Good point haha
Croatia doesn't need military planes
Goverement decides to buy a used plane from Israel
The deal doesn't go threw because USA demands that israeli tehnology has to be taken out from the planes first (or something like that)
One of the reps decide to gift prime minister and minister of a defence toy planes to replace the one from Israel
Minister of defence angry, throws the toy from the reps hand and wants to fight but others stop him
Whats the story behind the printer/handcuffs
We "lead love", "voditi ljubav".
>Yes, but also, if you have to use word sex, its have sex (imati seks), but it really is wierd
It's weird in our language and it's word for word translation from English
What is natural
Jebati se
My grandma used to tell stories, how older women used poppy to calm their children
When I say, used poppy, I mean, they made heroin and drugged their children
Today poppy is used usually for baked goods and is common, I'd say
Used as cooking ingredient, but not that much
Weeds that grow by train tracks
We have makovnjača in Dalmatia too, I heard it was brought during Austria-Hungary
We have the same thing as the bird language you described but we use "p" instead of "v".
I didn't know that it's well know in Serbia as well, that is very cool
Because sometimes when I mentioned šatrovački to my friends that are from southern parts of Croatia, they wouldn't know what I was talking about
If someone wants to hear more, there is also this song that is originally recorded this way
[Song]
Apparently, it's common in ex-Yu capitals so this makes sense (I'm from Zagreb)
[Battle of Krbava Field in 1493] we lost a lot of our nobility that day and it kinda reduced our standing compared to the Hungarians
I think by changing the course of that battle Croatian independence would be more likely to happen sooner
Also the turkish advance would be halted
Prevent the assasination of Franz Ferdinand
Contrary to popular belief, WWI wasn't set in stone, and without this event, it is quite possible that it wouldn't happen at all
Helping to preserve Austria-Hungary would also be a massive benefit
Probably the battle of Pakozd during 1848 in Hungary when the Croats went to Budapest(was Pest an Buda at the time) to stop the Hungarian revolution and save Austria from falling
It was also about Croatia who wanted equal rights as Hungary and Austria in the monarchy
During the battle which was going kind of for the Croatian side our ban Josip Jelačić(he lead the Croats to Budapest but was also an Austrian general and he was loyal to Austrians) was called in to save Vienna and the king from another revolution ao he went and took the armies during battle to save Vienna so while Croats look at the battle as a draw Hungarians took it as a win so that is how you will see it in wikipedia as a Hungarian win, but I would change this battle so that ban Josip Jelačić stayed and won the battle and then went to Vienna and stop the uprising there but I don't know if that is too unrealistic
Also another dude also wrote for Croatia the battle of Krbava against the Ottomans so he explained it well too
Imagine if someone made a hoi mod where this all happens
The Turkish advance wouldn't be halted, as the Turks involved were mainly raiding troops from Bosnia, and not any serious central Ottoman military formation
No way could Croatia muster enough men to fight the main Ottoman army (which numbered at least 100 000 men at full strength, and likely much more)
The other points stand - the loss of the nobility was a severe blow
Though the loss of the Zrinskis in their failed plot was an even greater blow, as it wiped out the last powerful family in Croatia
I'm sure people would have been saying the same today had the Cuban Missile Crisis turned the Cold War into WWIII
"The tensions were enormous", "War was inevitable", "Both sides had plans to invade the other", "The world was a boiling kettle" etc
WWI is only seemingly inevitable with hindsight
There were other crises before the July Crisis, and they ended up being contained and calmed down
There is no reason to assume that had the Archduke not been killed by a Bosnian Serb with ties to Belgrade, a war would erupt anyway
Sure, there were plenty of warmongers in all european countries at the time, but the alliance system wasn’t as entrenched or unchanging as we seem to think today (likely influenced by bloc politics of the Cold War), and the warmongers had many, many opponents in government in all countries as well
I mean, Franz Ferdinand is a prime example there as well - as long as he lived, the Empire would not go to war under any circumstances, period
He was staunchly opposed to any sort of foreign military intervention, as he was focused on plans to build up strength at home
And in the end, the governments of all the other participants were in a similar situation, bellicose-yet-dreading-war
While not entirely comparable to nuclear MAD of the later 20th century, there was a significant fear of war and the devastating effects it would have on a very financially and economically interconnected Europe
I don't if this counts but south slavs have Hajduks and Uskoks that fought against Turks
In unoccupied Croatia they were mercenaries, bandits and freedom fighters that escaped from Ottoman-occupied territories and settled in what little was left of either the Croatian kingdom or in regions under Venetian rule
They went out to raid and pillage Turks, Venetians and basically whoever they could to survive
Over time they gained both Imperial Habsburg (as the Habsburgs were elected kings of the remnants of Croatia) and Venetian patronage, and the two increasingly started using them for their own interests and gains
They ended up being called Uskoci, and after a good run they were disbanded by Imperial authorities for being more trouble than they were worth (once the Emperor wished for peace with Venice)
In Croatia, right now you can get 10 for 15 kn (around €2)
Max price has been set to 12 kn per mask, and there were shortages for about 2 months (March and April)
Pre-pandemic price was about 20 kn for a package of 50
This is for disposable masks
I don't think Yalta affected us much, especially since we split off from the Soviets and did our own thing in '48
EDIT: Typos
In Croatia there is a musical called "Jalta, Jalta", portraying the world "leaders" as corrupted and selfish, and it advocates that they should have left the other countries alone
(Zelena livada being left as no ones land
) It must have affected Croatia somehow, but I'm not quite sure how
Moreover, I have no idea what the opinions of the majority of people are
But at least we got a great musical out of it
[It still impacts Poland a great deal to this very day
A musical
I bet it was
It was a huge amount of territory loss with a lot of German population in it
Anyone would have been upset about it
No matter the involment and the side in the war
Jalta, jalta i pjesma Neka cijeli ovaj svijet, moraš znati za to
Ne znam, ali stavljam to na watch listu
I'd like to copy trains from France
France and Germany are kinda role models for me
Regard to laws and rules from Nordic states
Mentality of the Germans probably because if I copied the richness of some country it would probably be used wrongly and lost but if we think a bit more like Germans we wouldn't be in this economic situation right now
Croatia
Copying Germans since 1438
>outsmarted
I felt this
People will say rakija, but imo the "most Croatian" liquor would be [Pelinkovac] It's known in other countries of the region as well, but it's nowhere near as popular
Jao, uskocio si ispred mene
Ugh tastes so bad
It's yours
We don't want it
First time i ever got really drunk was on my school trip to Hungary when i was drinking Becherovka when i was 16
It was the only thing we were able to find in a gas station near our hotel
Also, on my senior trip to Czechia we went to a Becherovka factory in Karlovy vary
Although half of us was still under age they gave us sampels of different types of Becherovka to try and review
I remember i really liked the Ice&Fire one
Borovniča is the shit, I love it
Yea thats basically the main drink in Croatia as well
Would rakija be considered a liquor, though
It's really not though
It's popular, but I think pelinkovac takes the prize in Croatia
To je isto rakija - baza je lozovača, jedino ima više aroma, nije samo od jednog voća
i absolutely hate the amount of tenses it has
past tenses
ok, manageable, have some sense
six possible future tenses separated solely by semantics and nearly untranslatable from my native to English/vice versa
please stay the hell away from me
I'm assuming there would be much less negative talk about unions and minimum wages
Grouping 87 different cultures and ethnicities, who just happen to live on the same continent, into a single group called European
I think recently someone posted something on r/politicalhumour which was about European politics (Brexit I think) and the mods deleted it on the grounds that politicalhumour is supposed to be jokes about American politics and no other country
Lol
I feel like that and many other conversations which are political which Europe has reached a consensus with (free healthcare good, unions are a right, guns bad) would have been avoided
But I feel like any narrative could be sold in the US under the guise of "they stealin ur freedom" which is why they shreek at government trying to limit their corporate overlords
>He wants to kill people for a living, what a hero
Tbh we also have veterans here but we don't make such a big deal out of it
Acusing everyone of racism even though we have a completely different understanding of race and racial relationships from them
Hell, most of Europe is divided when it comes to these things and pretty much all of us have a relationship with minorities which is not comparable to the American one
This is r/askEurope
I think we do make a big deal out of it, just not that big
At least ours were protecting our country, rather than fighting for oil on the other side of the world
Except a lot of those ""veterans"" are rarely real veterans
I've only met two who were actually in the war,and they refused to tell me about what they experienced, othen then a few things, such as 'oh I was there' and 'I stood by a tank that shot at the enemy'
And it's the media mostly that makes it that big of a deal tbf
> it's still not such a deal as it is in USA
That's mostly what I was trying to say
Well, to begin with, some of European countries never partook in the slave trade
Which means that the historical relationship we had with people of colour is vastly different to those of the US
POC migrated to Europe in various different environments and forms, ie as labour force in Yugoslavia during the Non-Alignment movement
Sure, it is a very niche example, but I am fairly certain you will agree that having a sudden influx of labourers from Africa during the 1950s is vastly different to having generations of people move due to effects of colonialism and slavery
That being said, on a more basic level, the word "gypsy" is going to mean something completely else in Ireland than it would in Bulgaria, and Balkan people use the word "Asian" very differently to the British for example
Citizens of some countries percieve "Muslim" as an racial category, while in the former-Yugoslavia it is a concept that has almost nothing to do with race and everything to do with ethnicity
This is not to say that Europeans are not racist nor that racial splits and issues do not exist - it is only to say that history and cultural context play a crucial role in how these issues come about in the sphere of political
The focus is going to be on Europe
Many places (Croatia included) just use it as you use toilet
And we even write it with W even though we don't have that letter in our language
I hate the entire idea of "respecting veterans", but I didn't know that
Oh well
Sure, but I'm saying that European bias is to be expected
Pretty much what I meant
Surely, there are guns used and are (semi)legal in countries like Croatia (where I am from), Switzerland etc but we agree on the context in which they are used
Some got them from serving in the military, some for licesend hunting etc but in most cases they are not used to hurt another civilian
What I meant is that, in case that the usage of guns would be so widespread it would cause an atmosphere of violence, I am pretty sure most of our countries would agree to ban/heavily restrict their usage
I apologise for not replying directly to you, so I am c/p my reply to another comment in this thread:

Vienna is Beč in Croatian
Not sure about the ethimology
Can't think of any other that is drastically different
We call Vienna "Beč"(Baech) and Slovens call Vienna "Dunaj"(Do-nah-y)
Yes, č and ć are pronounced like "ch" - difference is that č is harder and ć softer, but it is often indistinguishable in conversation
As of valley girls, I'm not sure how they exactly sound like, but I think you are correct
Beč is Turkish originally but idk the etymology and Dunaj definitely comes from Danube
1 kn maybe two gums or two plastic bags in the store
10 kn expensive loaf of bread or a dozen eggs
100 kn normal restaurant meal for one (drink, fries, grilled meat, cake), food for a nice meal for 4 at home (meat potatoes, veggies)
For 1 you can buy 2 pieces of gum
For 10 you can get an ice cream thats pretty good
For 100 you can order a jumbo pizza and buy 6 liters of coca
1HRK - a single chewing gum
10HRK - ~1 liter of petrol/diesel, slice of pizza, some basic sandwich in local bakery
100HRK - starter, main meal and drink, or almost three BigMac meals
Wasn't subway meal deal 6-6
5 euros 2-3 years ago
Like BMT and pepsi from the tap
F kao Frend je zabava prava (F for friend is truly the joy)
U je za Uvijek tu (U is for always nearby)
N je za Nikad tužan nisi ti (N is for you to never be sad again)
*u moru su sretni svi* (under the sea everyone is happy)
P.S. I quit trying to make the last translation less creepy
• F kao frend je zabava prava - F like a freind is real fun
• U je za uvijek tu - U is for always being there
• N je da nikad tužan nisi ti (U moru su sretni svi) - N is for never being sad (Everyone is happy in the sea)
I made it less creepy I think
F is for friend is the true fun
U is for always here
N is for youre never sad
because everyones happy in the sea
there, less creepy
Pretty OK
Being in a hurry makes oxygen brain not much and me brain kill
Ako dobro paše u prijevodu, zašto ne ?

First half of 1st grade you do print and then you learn cursive
Honestly idk how people can *not* write in cursive
Its so much quicker and it can look good (although mine doesnt)
Both but i write in cursive
We learned both but basically after learning cursive kept using that
Cursive
And by the time of 6 and 7th grade, 95% of students teach themselves printed letters becuase it's way quicker, more readable, prettier and more compact to write
We were taught both
Since when is cursive faster to write
Well you're forced to write in cursive until you graduate so it makes sense that most people here keep writing in cursive
You're not
All through high school some people would write in print no one said a thing
In my high school you can write any way you want in book but on tests you must write in cursive
We were forced to write in cursive
If you didn't then whatever you wrote wasn't taken into account
* Tourists are overcharged a lot of things
* "The Expensive Rose" - A person offers you a rose for your SO, and when they hand you one, they ask for a ridicolously high price
* Some people go around, pretending to be deaf, and ask for donations - the worst part is, the actual institute does need money, but people are now wary of paying because of scammers
And here's one I've seen only once, but it worked:
* So, during an event, a person wearing a "STAFF" shirt approached a girl and asked for her ID, she pulled out her wallet, as just as she took out her ID from her wallet, the fake staff member swiped her wallet and ran
bro, I went to a restaurant and ordered a pizza
should've gone to McDonald's.
Like a very tasty thing
Yes please
It's quite expensive here nowadays
Dalmatinska Zagora - people are very primitive there
Split, it's like Croatian Florida
Maybe
If you asked me a decade ago, I'd say hell yeah
But things changed
I got married and have kids now, making moving away more difficult
My country joined EU, which means migrating to other EU countries - should I choose to do so - is way easier and requires far less paperwork compared to USA, making them more attractive
However, if I got offered a six figure salary job with decent benefits, I'd certainly consider it
I certainly would, but for 15 years
You see Europe has got a nasty demographics issue, many people will retire and most of the European countries will suffer from lack of demand for local products, lack of taxable population and growth of people in need for pension, that will cause a HUGE rise in taxes and I'm sorry but I'm not planning on paying most of my income to the government
EDIT: Tbh Europe getting fucked up doesn't sound so bad after reading these comments
I recently saw a clip on Youtube where a motorcyclist had a camera attached to his helmet and a car ran into him
It broke my heart when people approached him and asked if he wanted an ambulance (as he was seriously hurt) after which he replied he doesnt want one as he is unable to afford it
They share
If I know as much as a guy, they share even more amongst themselves
I think it's a pretty ok topic to talk about in Croatia, but I'm also a bit biased as my mother is the most open person I've ever seen, and no topic is off the table for her
Depends on the region, but in Slavonia:
Čvarci, Smoked bacon, Pig fat spread on bread an sprinkled with paprika, Kulen, Smoked sausages, Smoked ham
Any of those meals with a side of onions and some fresh cheese and for drink, a shot of Rakia or couple of glasses of Wine
Croatia-Hrvatska
Georgia is also Gruzija in Croatian
I mean there's the occasional dog or cat, but not muxh
Foxes and čagljevi(idk the translation but it is a dog-fox mix animal, basically a doggy fox) roam around all the time along with other smaller mammals
I once went to school and a fox was walking with me for a good 100 meters
But we all gotta be careful for any sick foxes
Everyone is talking about climate but ignores the historical ascpect
First of all the mediterranean had the most developed societies in Europe till the late middle ages
A developed and rich society is where food is not just something you need to survive but you make something more out of it
Olive oil is great, but if you need to produce a lot of food with high caloric intake to survive, olive oil is useless
The second thing is trade
The mediterranean was for a long time the center of trade in Europe, which among others means they had spices from all around the known world
When the trade centers shifted to the north, things changed
Tea became popular in England not because of climate but because they had access to it through trade
A lot of our food is not mass produced, in a lot of mediterranian countries what you guys consider "organic food" - its just considered "food".
Add the abundance of sun, nature being cleaner due to lack of industrialisation/overfishing etc, a natural non-aversion to herbs and spices, general better respect for food than in the north and you got yourself a winning combo
What I meant is that, if you are "working class" in southern europe, localy grown high-quality food is actually quite easy to obtain, unlike in the UK (where I live now), where you have an abundance of cheap food but most of it is of disgusting quality
And because of my previous point the whole "organic" point still stands - most of us do have access to foods which are found to be "organic" (localy grown) for little to no money, which is not the cases for the UK
I never said they aren't, I am saying working class in SE as opposed to the W/NE
You just blew my mind
The same as in English, Sveto Rimsko Carstvo
But to be more accurate and official, people sometimes add Njemačkog naroda (of the German Nation) *or* Njemačke narodnosti (of German nationality)
"Sveto Rimsko Carstvo (Njemačke Narodnosti)" = "Holy Roman Empire (of the German People)"
Sveto Rimsko Carstvo - literally just Holy Roman Empire
Well in usual terminology we call it: **Sveto rimsko carstvo** -Holy Roman Empire
But, the *full* name for it officially is: **Sveto rimsko carstvo njemačke narodnosti** - THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE OF THE GERMAN NATION
In Croatian we call it “Sveto Rimsko Carstvo Njemačke Narodnosti” (Holy Roman Empire of German Nation)
Bohemia, Low Countries, Slovenia, northern Italy, Burgundy
not German
Yes, with the same level of success as your guys
They are mostly riddiculed
There were lingual purists in Croatia back in the 90's. Luckily the trend had faded away since
There are still attempts to create Croatian words for loans, but unfortunately they end up ridiculed and noone takes them seriously
I wish there was a more successful movement to preserve our heritage
fewer and less
can't bother at this point with thrm honestly
also, turtle/tortoise
i know the difference i just frankly think the distinction is stupid and i just don't bother w it
Pope John Paul II
In Croatia, nationalists are obsessed with Franjo Tuđman, while most left-oriented old people idolize Josip Broz Tito
Landgenoten
Stille Willem
Was the Sava named after him
I hate that they named Zagreb's airport after him
It is such an ugly name
There has been a suggestion to name it "Golubica" (Dove) and it got rejected
It would've been such a nice and fitting name for it
Or to just keep it as before, "Pleso". Oh well
According to wikipedia, [it is much older]
I think it would be much better to name it after one of our many scientists like Faust Vrančić. Anyways I agree with you that the current name sucks
Exactly
Croatian conservatives are unanimously praising Tuđman, but most of them are divided on Pavelić.
Imagine if we named it Nikola Tesla just to piss off the Serbs
Homophobes
Of course it does
True
But no matter how much I like the EU I'll take no Holocaust, no cold war, no European cities leveled to the ground, no generations of young men slaughtered twice, any day of the week
Not at all, I'm at home everywhere
Not Reddit per se, but I’ve noticed a similair thing on several discord servera I use
I feel a massive divide between myself and the americans, while I have no problem at all talking with fellow Europeans
The servers are varied in topic and population, and are all international, so it doesn’t seem related to a particular demographic
Last 3, scientists, not celebrities
Big difference
They actually contribute something to society
Disclaimer: I regard celebrities only as persons who are famous because they are famous, ie
Kardashians
I do believe actors, musicians and etc
Do contribute to society
Who the fuck thinks that in Europe, except perhaps some Turkish immigrants in Germany
I find it funny how we accuse Americans of this, but you correctly said the anglosphere
The Brits, even though in lesser numbers and to a lesser extent, are similarly guilty of the same crime of assuming everyone lives/should live like them
Well Mechanical engineering is a branch of science that deals in applying science to everyday life and needs
Oh, I wasn’t really aware of that
Zagreb: The capital, the place where a quarter of the population and a third of the country's wealth is located
The only actually big city in the country (sitting at around 750k population, with a metropolitan area reaching over 1,1 million), and generally the only place worth living in for the majority of professionals in any field
At least according to it's inhabitants
Rich, according to Croatian standards anyway, and very central European looking
Likes to be called little Vienna, but I'm not sure about that
Split; Second largest, de-facto capital of the littoral part of the country
Significantly smaller, and significantly poorer than the capital
Seems to be increasing in crime recently
Has Diocletian's Palace as it's city center, which is quite impressive
Touristy as fuck
Rijeka; Third largest, or just about, known for a very cool mix of mediterrannean and central european architecture
Also, has quite a lot of functional and non-functional industrial architecture (old factories from the Austro-Hungarian era and newish refineries and shipyards), so it's cool for people who like that sort of thing, but also ugly for people who don't. Prides itself on being liberally minded and open to multiculturalism
Big port city
Osijek: Second largest continental city, after Zagreb
Emptying quickly (though not as quickly as its surrounding countryside), and on the poorer end of the spectrum
Definitely the most east-european looking and feeling city in the country
Pula: Northernmost big-ish coastal city, presiding over the Istrian peninsula
Culturally most distinct from the rest of the country, with strong Italian influences
Has a pretty nicely preserved Amphitheater right in the city's center, and tons of relatively impressive Austro-Hungarian military architecture - it was the main Imperial and Royal naval base, and the surrounding system of defensive fortifications bears witness to that
Just had a big shipyard go under, which was the last of it's heavy industry
Zagreb: Christmas market
Dubrovnik: Game of Thrones
Split: Dioclecians palace
Rijeka: Carneval
Zadar: sea organ
Pula: Roman arena
Dubrovnik: well,there was this show
Also for Split: Croatian Florida
How do you think the kosovo situation will resolve
I'm guessing you wont be able to join without recognizing kosovo, right
And recognizing kosovo feels like a political suicide in serbia, whoever does it will probably be branded as a traitor by most so what do you think will be a solution to this problem
What's the general opinion in serbia regarding EU vs kosovo
Maybe i'm mistaken but i feel like older people are mostly against the EU since they still look at russia as their savior and saint while younger people prefer the EU so they can gtfo from there as soon as possible
>Here's the thing, I don't see why Serbia would need to recognize Kosovo
The EU certainly can't demand this when it's own member states don't recognise it
>The EU only requested normalisation in relations which is a viable thing
Kosovo would stay frozen as it is for the time being
You're also correct that it would be political suicide even to suggest such a thing
Oh, i thought its one of the requests
But yeah, that makes sense
Until many years from now when kosovo starts the proccess of joining the union themselves
Would be pretty stupid to have a union where a member is not recognized by other members of the union
>Most agree that the EU isn't worth losing Kosovo (or at least losing rights to Kosovo), it's too important to us culturally, historically and not to mention our people and cultural sights are in danger there so it's basically betrayal at that point
Betrayal by who
Kosovo albanians
I feel for you and i'm on your side regarding kosovo but i just think that sometimes it's better to count your losses and carry on looking in the future
Right now i feel like kosovo is huge ball and chain pulling you back
In my opinion i'd always pick EU over something like kosovo, if it came to that
Regarding your people and cultural sites being in danger, i find that hard to believe
What do you mean by that
Albanians destroying old churches and attacking serbian people on the streets
>Actually it's not like that at all
In most EU countries the older generations are right wing here it's basically 50/50 with older and younger people
Yeah, same here
>Here's the general consensus, most would like to join the EU AND keep good relations with Russia
Russia is an important friend to Serbia, maybe more than the EU since they fiercely don't recognise Kosovo, losing such an important ally isn't in our interests
That's true but can it be done
Will russia not mind you joining the EU
I guess they'd mind if you joined NATO, right
Also don't know, but I doubt it happened overnight
It was probably a gradual process that lasted through several centuries
Like most surnames, I assume no one thinks that a Smith has an actual blacksmith in his family haha
Lived in Denmark and Germany for total of 5 years and now going back to Croatia again this year
I do, however, plan on comming back to Germany in few years again
Important to note here is that I moved cause of work and school
to me it is not a big deal where I am, as long as I can have a decent life
But, I am still happy to go back home for a while
I missed Croatia
I came back to Croatia from Germany recently too, unfortunately not willingly but rather due to COVID-19
I must admit I missed it a lot and I'm happy to be back, however I don't think I could ever work here
The work mentality, stupid management, bad system and toxic colleagues all pushed me away
Now I can't wait to go back to DE
You see
this mentality, stupid management, bad system and toxic colleagues have been present in my workplace here in Germany as well
The company is German, job position is a great one (fashion industry and clothing), colleagues are German and yet the same sh*t has been happening
Many people have quit from this company due to boss screaming at them, terrorizing them for small mistakes, having social hierarchy in the company, massive gossips and dramas, everyday crying by the female coleagues cause someone yelled at them
You cannot escape this no matter the country
In the end, it is all up to you how you handle it
I personally did the following, I waited for my trial period to end and got the full contract on unspecified time period
So, I was basically untouchable in the company as lomg as I did my job
And then, I had a little talk with my boss
Called him out on his behaviour, his managers' behaviours and treatment of the collegaues, imposible deadlines and unpaied long overtimes (we stayed in the company for more than 2 hours overtime each day, which is illegal in Germany
Also some of them slept in the company as well due to overtime) and all the other little details
After that talk boss never spoke to me directly and when he did he spoke nicely and professionally
I stayed after that in the company for another year and finally I decided to quit and move one to something better I found
Germany, Denmark, Croatia, USA or any other country for that matter
there is no escaping the morons and mistreatment
It is not the country's fault
So in my opinion, having this mentallity that "Croatia sucks" and I will be better treated for my work and my time in "Germany, Denmark
" is all a delusion
You won't. It is all about the money that the company cares

We have 5 kuna (HRK) coin in Croatia and it's also quite big
We also had a 5 HRK note, but that didn't last long
Fun fact: our notes were designed based on DM
We also have special 25kn coins that *are* quite rare
They are also about double the size of the 5kn coin
I have a few of those
Same :)

Well yeah but Pewdiepie
What is the worst song your country sent to Eurovision
For Croatia, the lowest point ever was definitely 2006 when we sent Severina with the utter trash of a song called [Moja štikla]
By God, I wanted to gauge out both my eyes and go van Gogh on both of my ears
I still cringe when I remember that horrible rubbish
We were generally between meh and pretty terrible for years now
I was curious how would Damir Kedžo do since he's a really solid vocalist, but, well, corona
it's Moja stikla (translation My high heel)
just a description of how dumb of a song it is: My brother and I were 8 and 10 years old and had a sleepover at grandparents' house when the choice for the Eurovision song was on tv and they let us call to vote for one song
So we decided it would be so fun to find the dumbest song, the one with zero chance to win, and call and vote for that song
We were dying laughing the whole evening until the winner was announced
The song we voted for as a joke- won and went to the Eurovision
Croatia is seriously limited with the impossibility to plagiarize some foreign song and send it to Eurosong
Plagiarizing, which is a common practice of the music scene in Croatia, can help us send some better songs to Europe, present our culture in a more favorable light, and gift Europe with our national genius that is so far more evident in corruption, fake democracy, or rampant emigration
Remove the barriers
Oh wow I feel the Mediterran out of that song
Like yeah, we will protest, but 5 people will come out at max
Whoever made those captions is as close to God as any Pope
That song feels like it should have some fireworks or some big and memorable dancing
This just looks forgettable
If you are trying to find a method to that madness of a song
Don't bother, there isn't one
As I said, that song is just a friggin word salad
Lol, it's trying to be women empowerment, but fails as most parts have no connections
She is singing about how she is rejecting guys, then the chorus is " the grass dosen't grow where my high heels lands". The best parts are definitely those random s-s-s-sex and when the guys start singing as they are basically narrating what they put in the sandwich and she finishes with Africa Paprika
She's also one of the biggest stars in Croatia and there is even a porn about her
>She's also one of the biggest stars in Croatia and there is even a porn about her
She was a singer before she became famous
My absolute favourite is the flag Ban Jelačić took into battle
Or the Kingdom of Croatia (Austrian subdivision)
[This one] .
The modern one is a heraldic travesty, and I the old one represents the country better
I think the state flag is so much better than what you have
It looks like it was made in MS paint
I think the Kaiser naval flag is best
[Digital version of the Jelačić's flag]
[The flag itself]
It would look like a racing flag
It's too boring
Wonder if jealousy and jalousien have anything in common and why
in Croatia there is ljubomoran (jealous) and zavidan (envious) and they are used completely diferently
ljubomoran/jealous is for romantic relationships mostly and zavidan/envious is more general and used more often
Amazing :D Thanks
Three main dialects and each with probably hundreds of regional variants
In some cases you can pinpoint someone's hometown from it
Some are more understandable, but in many cases it is almost a different language
I'm truly interested, can Serbians (or any other nationality from Balkan) understand Dalmatian dialect something like [this] Or something from Međimurje like [this] tho I guess some Slovenians can understand Međimurski better than some Croatians
What are some of the weirdest Serbian dialects
No Slovenia and Czechia were in the same union . It included parts of Poland, Ukraine, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Romania, Italy, and Hungary
I still don't get how Australians ruled over such a huge chunk of Europe in 19th century
Australians were always known for being lovers
I think it's funny how some notable people in AU have different legacy in each country
Somebody like Ban Josip Jelačić (Jellachich, Jellasics) is considered a national hero in Croatia, a traitor in Hungary and a Rebel in Austria, while somone like Franz Ferdinand is considered a Good guy among Croats and apsolute asshole by the Serbs
>Salzburg: music probably (maybe some art and historians too

>But also no vote
Yeah, about that
Havent seen a single balkan person comment here so that just makes me think that the weird but real political parties are governing the country right now
In Croatia one dude tried to be president and in his presentations he would openly say that he wants to rob people and other nations
When they asked him what does he think about NATO he said that he wants to steal money from them because everyone does
He ended up getting a lot of votes
From 12 candidates he was 5th
Every single party in Croatia is a really weird joke
Imo it would have to be the party of Ivan Pernar (SIP - Stranka Ivana Pernara)
It's politics and claims are just, very weird
Neutrality, Euroskepticism, Recognition of Palestine, etc
I'm surprised nobody mentioned the guy who wanted to name his party Milan Bandić. He's funny as hell
What is the smallest country that you would consider big
Use any metric you want
I'll go woth Albania
When you look at a map of Europe, the size of Albania is large enough that its borders are quite hard to miss
Conversely, you won't notice the borders of Malta, Luxembourg, Armenia, Slovenia or Faroe islands unless you're actively searching for them on the map since their land size is much smaller
Well I have a really generic answer - Zagreb
It's my home city as well as the biggest city and the capital
But hey, it's got everything you need, nature, suburbs, and city life
Also I really like the culture and the atmosphere of the place
I really like Varaždin as well, a much smaller city northeast of Zagreb (my extended family is from the area, and it's a really nice place), and Rijeka
Rijeka is a cool industrial port city that's this blend of Mediterranean and Austro-Hungarian, with a history that's honestly more interesting than that of Zagreb
Agram, tak imam te rad
Edit - because my grammar was all over the place
Split for sure since everything criminally related or things that don't happen in other parts in Croatia happen there
I don't know any answer besides Zagreb either, Varaždin would be a contender maybe but I haven't been there yet
Zagreb has something for everyone and has a really nice vibe when you think about it
Worst city is probably Vukovar unfortunately, won't ever be the same
Croatian per se is meh, but if you include everything in Serbo-Croatian (as one should), then it's great
I'd even say they're up to par with the English ones, honestly
I dont think were that good

I think it’s fun how there are Croats who emigrated to New Zealand in 19th century and married and had children with women of Maori descent
These people of Croatian-Maori descent are referred to as Tarara, and Tarara Day is celebrated on March 15th
Croats have emmigrated (and still emmigrate) to various countries, mostly the US, Germany and more recently to Ireland but it's a little known fact that Punta Arenas, one of the most southern cities in the world has a significant croatian population
Some sources even claim that half of the town's population is of full or partial croatian descent
There is even a cool video about the [topic]
Fućkaj se, sjetio sam se Tarare i sad gledam da nisam jedini koji se toga sjetio :D Budem samo ekipu iz Punta Arenasa pustio

Oh it's super easy to find if you are Bosnian or Croatian
Do you call [this] Burek sa sirom or Sirnica
Yup Sirnica is Bosnian
It's common for Bosnians to say that we are uncultured savages for calling it Burek sa sirom
We sent a majority Serbian delegation to Belgrade to negotiate the way Croatia (State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs) would join Serbia with a paper dictating Croatian stances on crucial points of the union (federative territorial arrangement, parliamentary monarchy and such stuff
The delegation simply threw the paper out during their trip and said we're joining without preconditions
This led the Croats into 2 failed states, years of oppression and numerous crimes against them
And a single wrong turn
You're not the only ones, mate
More land for Serbia, that's why

Well I personally like our names very much but names in English don't really have a translation but Hungarian and German do and I'm quite fond of them but Serbian doesn't sound good, example:
Osiijek-Croatian/Esseg-German/Essek-Hungarian/Ocek-Serbian
Valpovo-Croatian/Valpo-Hungarian
Kneževi Vinogradi-Croatian/Herzegszollos- Hungarian
Varaždin-Croatian/Varasd-Hungarian
Donji Miholjac-Croatian/Alsomiholjac-Hungarian/Unter-Miholtz-German
Beli Manastir-Serbian actually/Monoštor-old name on Croatian/Pelmonostor-Hungarian/Manoster-German
Yes, even villages but to be fair in Baranja there are a lot of Hungarians too and not just there also a few villages in the heart of Slavonia like Laslovo/Laszlovo  or Korođ/Korogy
We also have a lot of Italian names for coastal towns in Croatia which sound very Mediterranean to me and nice
Croatian vs
Italian
Pula - Pola
Poreč - Parenzo
Rijeka - Fiume
Zadar - Zara
Split - Spalato
Dubrovnik - Ragusa
Vis - Issa
In Hungarian, Croatian, Serbian and some other maybe, Vienna is called Becs/Beč/Беч and in Slovenian and Slovene as the other repoy said it is called Dunaj
Almost all elvish in modern fantasy is inspired or outright stolen from welsh and Irish
Oh yes I forgot the Italian names they are very nice sounding too
Kneževi vinogradi literally means prince's vineyard or duke's vineyard(Knez meaning duke but we can go with prince too and Kneževi is the same word but as an adjective) and Miholjac means st
Michael and it is same in both Hungarian and Croatian and even German as I wrote(Unter-Miholtz)
Also fun fact some names of towns actually kept the name varos(town in Hungarian) in their names like Vukovar, Daruvar or Bjelovar(all having "var" in the end) and in Hungarian Diakovar is Đakovo
I thought var is just short for varos but anyway Vukovar actually means river Vuka that flows into Danube in Vukovar so it would be Vuka castle and Daruvar comes from the Hungarian Daru and var as you said and Bjelovar is what it is probably but idk what is Diakovar/Đakovo
Whole Slavonia probably  (joke, but kind of not at the same time)

Eggs always in the fridge
We buy milk kind of in bulk so 1 carton always stays in the fridge (the one we're currently murdering by drinking) while the others stay in the pantry, awaiting their fate, mourning their fallen comrades
Eggs, always
Milk depends
We have pasterized, long lasting milk that we usually put in fridge only when we open it
For fresh milk it is sold in fridges and kept in it
Yes, both is refrigerated at shops and at home
It weirds me out not putting it in the fridge
I used to use the Croatian QWERTZ, but I switched to American QWERTY, although I still use QWERTZ on mobile
QWERTZ with č ć đ ž and š, some other things are moved around as well, such as parentheses being on 8 and 9
QUERTZ with šđčćž on the right side of the keyboard (if on computer/laptop, on the phone i just use QUERTZ bc i type without these letters)

This is probably the most foreign-sounding thing I read on this subreddit
You would not be invited next time if you didn't share while bringing nothing is usually ok
Well, not exactly a loophole in the strict sense, but its a "fun" thing in croatia that gets mentioned every time someone big gets sentenced
In Croatia lots of people, especially shady businessmen and private investors have dual citizenship in bosnia
So if/when they are sentenced (eg embezzelment, money loundering, war crimes, tax fraud, vehicular manslaughter) usual course of action is to go to Bosnia & Herzegovina and live (rule) from there since they tend not to extradict their citizens to Croatia
Its almost funny, but its very annoying/enraging

Zagreb
Not specific enough :)
Well I'm gonna go here and only talk about standard Croatian accents not the dialects
So the Croats in and around Zagreb mostly have an accent on the end of words rather than in the first part
They aren't really annoying they just speak but Herzegovian Croatian is fucked up, they talk very annoyingly, somehow speaking very fast but still lengthening words and putting accents in the front and then when speaking poundering the first part of the word with the accents (krAva-standard, krAAAva-Herzegovian alsonthe word means cow)
Then Istrias just speak weirdly like their accent is like Australian to British and Dalmatians like to lengthen words and putting the "i" sound everywhere
Then Slavonians just talk slowly having accents in the front but just generally speaking slow except for the northern part which speaks a little faster
Other accents are from the mountains and they are mostly mixed and the northernmost part speaks its own language
Its not that important
But it does inply class a bit
Like if you have a Lika accent or a harecore Kajkavian accent you're most likely a village boi, etc
croatia, i dont think there's any single accent that's posh unless you are talking in a painfully standardized manner
even people from the south (where the standardized language comes from) and the capital have things to nake fun of about their accents
any accent can be "uneducated" if you emphasize it enough but mostly it's the rural accents (of which there are many) that take the role
Agree with you on that
I don’t think anyone would even notice you’re alone in Croatia, people generally don’t care about that
That being said I still prefer to have company while eating out, but that’s personal preference
8 cultural and 2 natural, most famous would be Plitvice Lakes and Dubrovnik Old Town

Should burek with cheese be classified as a burek or a cheese pie (sirnica)
This debate has been going for a very long time and we're no closer to an answer
I'm pretty sure that a war will start because of it at some point
I just think that people are overreacting
I could agree that in Bosnia burek is only with meat, but in Croatia it can be with anything because burek is a Turkish dish which came to Croatia through Kosovars and Ottomans
I mean, if Bosnians can put mayonnaise on pizza, why wouldn't we put cheese in it
We've got the bell pepper kind and it's always with rice and ground meat
Other variant is shredded potatoes bacon inside bellpeppers and then baked while covered with an egg and sourcream mix
We've loaned those words from you - paradajz, palačinka, krafna (all singular)
Horvatia
Closer to Hrvatska than Croatia but still pronouncable i think
I would change the name for Croatia because it is not even close to the Croatian name for Croatia which is Hrvatska but I don't know if people would easily pronounce Hrvatska so I would stay with the name Croatia
But the word Croatia comes from the french word for tie which is something like Croata and they called us that during the napoleonic wars when Croats would go into battle with ties around their necks, so you can probably call us Tieland instead of Croatia too
I would change it to Hrvatia
I would rether use Itallian "Croazia". It sound much nicer
We call you Mađarska so it doesn't sound that stupid to me
Also it's closer to Magyòrszag so it makes more sense
Nah, it's actually the opposite
The word for tie came from the word for Croats
The reason for the difference of Hrvatska and Croatia is because the Latin language didn't have the H, so they wrote Hrvat as Crvat, as the C sound was the closest they could get to the H. Then that eventually evolved to Croat
Tieland is waaay too close to Thailand, also getting Croatian people to start using the word Croatia would be a bit of a problem
Croata sounds similar to the Croatans
Croatia used to be called Horvatska before we dropped the O. The Horvat surname to us is what "Smith" is to the anglosphere
Isti sir drugo pakiranje
That's how it works in Croatian
The country is "Nizozemska" and your language is "Nizozemski"
If you pronounced it with your gutteral sounds it would sound like a tumor coming out of your mouth
I think "Kovač" or "Kovačević" is "Smith". You know blacksmith=kovač.
I'm a big fan of scandinavian names but they are pretty uncommon in croatia, other than sven and erik
I'd love to name my kid bjorn but people would just think that i'm a self centered hipster
So we named him vigo, still a bit scandinavian but normal
Also, while we're at it, while googling for cool names we found Ganja on the list of popular scandinavian names
Wtf
Does anyone know someone called ganja
Edit: [here's] the screenshot i dug out from february 2nd of this year
It was from some app my wife had which followed her pregnancy or something
I'm not sure
I love the name Jezebel, but, ya know,
Adolf
Not becouse of culture i know few people with germanic names but becouse of ehh
I know someone with "Anamarija" as their name (not sure how it's spelt though, together or apart), so i guess it could work
I think it's spelled together -or atleast, that's how the one I knows spells it
[Found the screenshot] if you're interested
Yeah, probably since i cant find it anymore
Who knows
Ganja means cannabis everywhere in the world
dude, i know
it's like that everywhere
that's why it's so funny and that's why i asked in the first place :D
I have them but i dont wear them often becuse i own only few of them
UK, well London specifically, it was okay but very underwhelming, especially compared to other European capitals
I like Austria, been there many times
Last time just before then pandemic in December of 2019
in Wien
Commented with my friends how Austria is what Croatia should've been and Wien what Zagreb had a chance to become but never fullfilled that  expectations
edit: oh yeah and whenever I spray some Boss Bottled I get reminded of Austria
Apple pie scent with warmth of cooked wine
No coastline for others on Mare Nostrum
Vienna, Budapest, Madrid, Copenhagen, Prague, Barcelona (not a capital but still), Venice (from a tourist point of view at least)
Bulgarian -ov
Serbian -ović
Croatian -ić / -ović
Slovenia -ič
Certainly not a rule, but if a surname ends in any of those there is a high chance there it’s from those countries
-ov  possesive (of someone)
-ić  diminutive (little someone)
Croatia has a lot of surnames like - ić
For example: - Martinović, Vuletić, Josipović...
Every couple of days I discover a word on this subbreddit I thought was Croatian but is actually Hungarian
In this case, Kovač (Kovacs), meaning blacksmith
These threads never fail to amaze me, truly
AFAIK (I don't live there) There's also some -eks in Zagorje (probably in Slovenia to IDK)
\-ić is actually not that common for diminutives (the only one i can think of is cvjetić), it's more common fro surnames
That's like saying -ica is diminutive, which it can be, but it's also the feminine ending
Ović and ević is two suffixes I think, where usually slavic patronymics with ov and ev got a south slavic addition
Version of my surname with just -ev is common in Baltics/Poland/Belarus, while -ević is found only here
It’s not completely the same, but similiar, because we say papuče, so papucs with an e at the end
I also learned recently that you guys say Becs for Vienna, we say Beč and I never knew we borrowed the name from you
>often end with -ev, -ov, -ski
TBH those sound more Macedonian than Serbian to me
Not in the slightest
Living in the UK, I see that being able to fluently speak another language is more of a win than anything else
I get to be (at least) bilingual with little to no effort - something I cannot say for the Brits
Also, being exposed to another language(s) from a very early age makes it easier for me to understand languages which are not my native or English and thus easier to learn
Not directly, but it is more or less accepted as a truth that bosnia and herzegovina is a keg of gunpowder once again
They are on the edge of being a failed state (although they've been there for years now), and I think once they break its going to be pure chaos in the region (again)
Well personally, i thing that something big is gonna happen i future in Balkans again
Mostly with BiH, multi national, ethnic and religious country
Its apparent that people within cant work together so i will and has to divide
Hopefully it will be peaceful, or else we risk another war in region or even serious involvement of US and, if Serbians manage to talk them in to, Russian in war
And by the looks of it, some serious money is coming from middle east for support of Muslim in BiH so somebody is counting on new clash down here
Dayton accords are not working as they are now

im not going in the whole recognizing-it-or-not teritory, but what are your thoughts about future relations regarding Kosovo
Stabile status quo or do you expect some infighting, bickering
I feel like kosovo is to serbia what hercegovina is to croatia - when things get tough politically or economicly , you can always call for nationalism and cause frictions tgere
They farthest they went in Croatia, after they burned half of Hungary and raised Zagreb to the ground, is Trogir
Which is a city on the Adriatic coast near Split

Well, isnt that how dialects work all around the world
Croatia is one of the smallest countries in europe but still a guy speaking only chaikavian dialect would not understand a guy speaking kaikavian
I mean i've been living in zagreb for 15 years now, i could drive few kilometres north and not understand a single word
The war ended 24 years ago
Obsessing over it is what is grinding our country to a halt
Once people realize this, life (and especially politics) will become easier
I dont think thats it .I dont wanna be that guy but hard to swallow pill for you would be that Kosovo will never be what it was again
The French haven't started a referendum to stick it to their closest allies in the first place
I reckon 27 other EU countries agree to disagree
Carthage is in Tunisia, not Algeria
They were Anatolian empire
North Africa was conquered the same way the Balkans or Levant were
But the rest of your point stands
There was very little interaction between North Africa and Europe
Homeland (?) war
Basically the one where we separate ourselves from Yugoslavia
It was like that for the entirety of my existence
All 5 of them every year
Ognjištarci - people around the hearth - extreme conservative Catholics with Nazi leanings, closest to rednecks
Very loud and unpleasant minority
Proud of their "stone genes" and Croatian Nazi past
They love Jesus and at the same time spread antisemitic slurs
Rvatine
Seljacine
Literally never heard the term, is it a regional thing
In Dalmatia we do have the term "vlaj" (comes from the Vlach peoples/historical term AFAIK) that refers to people not from the coast/cites, usually from Dalmatian Hinterland
It almost always caries negative connotations of primitivism/barbarism etc
but every now and again you'll find someone who uses the name for themselves with pride
The "opposite" of the term is "bodul", someone from the islands, but I've never heard it used as an insult, almost always proudly with self-identification, except a few people who insinuated that all islanders are communists, which, uh
I kinda know what he ment but stil
Also:
seljačina/seljober - augmentative of a villager (seljak), but with negative connotations
klošar - the dictionary defines it as a homeless person, but I've never heard it used that way
It usually means someone who is cheap or tacky, especially with their clothing
There are probably others i forgot too
"Genes of stone" is a famous nationalistic song sung by Marko Perkovic Thompson
It says that the best people are Catholics, that grew up in a stony area of Croatia and Herzegovina, mostly villages, and they don't like foreigners, but only God
Here it is with English subs just click on CC
I'd also add đikani to the list
Golden cross around neck, fanny pack equipped, tracksuit, BMW/Mercedes, beats his wife, most likely from Imotski/Hercegovina, listens to extremely loud Cajke even though he is a die-hard nationalist while spraying swastikas everywhere
It is extremely sad
Nobody is born a nationalist, a racist or a homophobe
Kids learn those things
That is the saddest part
Yugoslavia at that time had a huge rock scene that still people today listen
Throwing people in holes
If you find a pit, there is a reasonable chance there is a mass grave inside
Even our most known anti-war poem is called [The Pit] about people being led to their death in the pit
We don't have classes in different languages, but learning German, French or English is mandatory
I've heard Burgenland Croats have some bilingual gymnasiums
Don't know if the Kärnten Slovenes also have them
[Turns out there's only one
It's meant for Burgenland Croats and Hungarians and offers both German/Croatian and German/Hungarian bilingual education
Apparently that's one of the big problems for the Burgenland Croat community, as it's the only one, while Slovenes have two despite there being less of them
Maybe [Istria]
There is no political movement (even though they are often called separatists jokingly) but if you asked an average Istrian he would probably tell you they want more authonomy
It's not really a movement for independence but more for autonomy
Rijeka
They have their own political party that's a member of the European free alliance
Say if they were independent, they'd likeley join the EU
I don't have much knowledge on the subject of Rijekese (?) autonomy
Better to ask a person from the coast than me a continental
Istrian "seperatism" is just a joke
They want more autonomy and be more noticed and special
Kinda like Bavarians in Germany
Really
Which
DO NOT let them
Just give them the same status as Bavaria and you good
You and Italians need to agree first
Well Bosnians appear in a lot of our jokes (Mujo i Haso)
But wait
Is the place Voralberg
Imagine if Burgenland joined Croatia
The borders send shivers down my spine
[It's absolutely beautiful
Had to steal Prekmurje from Slovenia though, sorry Slovenia
You know what
Not as bad as I thought it would be
Imagine a croat empire
Burgenland, Banat, Molise, Patagonia and Pittsburgh
It would be wonderous
"Luk" means bow (weapon), arc, arch and onion
"Duga" means both rainbow and long (female adjective)
"Pas" means dog and waist
"Biti" means to be and to beat
"List" means leaf, piece of paper, a newspaper, a calf, a type of fish and the calf on your leg
Last but not least the most interesting one:
"Gore" means up there, hills, they're burning and worse
So you can make a sentence "Gore gore gore gore" which means "The hills up there burn worse".
Because their languages are extremely similar to English
Seriously Swedish has the exact same sentence structure and grammar as English and a lot of shared vocabulary
It's not that hard for these people to learn English
Definitely more with my nation since we are small as it is
I was reading that there was some study that proves how finns from all over the country are more geneticly distants than let say german and russian
if i may ask how big is the difference in a language
Thanks for clarification
Without any knowledge in finnish to me Rauma dialect just sounds regulsr finnish
Something like our kajkavian bednja accent
That thing is on another level
any word with ts i end up pronouncing as t͡s and the θ and ð sounds if im speking fast become t and d
just go irish and say t
idk maybe this can help you bro
idk maybe this can help you bro
try pronouncing it as bruhzil
Lived in Ireland for years, been in the UK numerous times for various lengths (days, weeks, months), and now live in Germany
It's just different culture
You can see it in many different areas of life, not just drinking
Anti social behavior in general is more prevalent/normal in the UK/IRE than on the mainland, same with the drinking and the consequences of drinking
Portugal is also my choice
Maybe because we are both mediterranean countries but the people, the food, the vine, the feeling, resembles Croatia a lot
But thats expected since they are eastern Europe ;) (im kidding my portuguese friends, love you️)
Spain, but in a weird way
Let me explain, there are really some major differences
However they eat late in the evening, portion sizes in a hotel were top notch ([like french would say] they like basketball, this is actually experience from Zagreb
I was coming home from the city center and some spanish guys asked me where is Dražen Petrović Museum and Memorial center
They have strong left-right political divide just like we have
When I say divide Spain is the only country where I can relate to that divide, it's almost like we are alternate universe, where far-right nationalists won in Spain, communist republicans won in Croatia/yugoslavia and every future aspect of politics will be shaped upon that divide
It's surreal
I can bet that people in Spain still vote depending on whether their ancestors were republican or monarchist
I know, it's like our older generations
Ah yes golden grave and šuker
Guy is an idiot
I remember when I was a kid father asked whose kit I want
I said 1998
away kit with Boban name on it
It was boban or prosinečki actually
Living in Zagreb, our city is situated on the plain that slopes down from the Medvednica mountains
The cool thing about that is, Medvednica is in the north, so you always know where north is, and therefore, the rest of the sides of the world
Also, living in the far eastern parts I can actually see the entire mountain and at the edge of my neighbourhood you can really have a wonderful view of it
It makes sunsets look even more beautiful
Yes
We use MS Teams, but we don't have lessons
Professors just send what you have to do and you have to do it until a deadline
Špičkovina (Croatia)
Can't really translate it, I guess you had to be there
Election of HDZ, no doubt
Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people went missing, some of them were found in ireland, germany and other similar countries but the huge majority will never return or be found
TBH, after reading the thread title, even before loading the comments, I expected this to be the top answer
The worst mid air collision happened in [german airspace] The worst part is the russian plane was filled with kids going to a school trip
Not great, not terrible
same shit happened in RI with The Station, there was even a compression that said that normal (flammable) sound isolation costs 2500$ to cover the whole club
It was 5000$ to install fire proof sound isolation, 2500$ difference and they didn't bother to pay that
Ffs they didn't even bother installing fire sprinklers, if only the fire sprinklers were installed there was a huge change no one would die
But hey when you have a friend that's a fire marshal I guess you don't need to have fire sprinklers
What is the cost of lies
man, you're right
i always thought it's the worst one but after a short trip to google i found out i was wrong
could be because during my schooling in germany we talked about that one the most, being over germany, so i just assumed it's the biggest one
even the one over zagreb had more casualties
most of them on the list were during take off or approach while we were talking about collisions on cruising altitudes tho, that could be the reason as well
Schools
When we went on school trips the parents had to pay
Do german schools pay for students' trips themselves
It might just be the case of not knowing what to comment in a situation like that
Sounds better than "welp that person just went into nothingness". As an agnostic, I don't mind people believing in the afterlife, but what triggers me is the "what can you do, that's life, it had to be that way". The amount of people who believe in destiny is ridiculous
What's the point of living life if you truly think everything is out of your control
Depends
If it's online then it goes something like this:
- where are you from
- croatia
- russia
- no, croatia
- russia
- no, cro-a-sha
-aaaa, croazia
If it's in person, far away from europe then it usually ended with them saying "aaa, davor suker, really good". In the last 10ish years davor šuker was changed for luka modrić.
My friend frrom minecraft is also Polish and lives in the UK
Btw their reaction is *Oh i know that country its beautiful*
It has snowed and it melted the very next day
Zagreb and surrounding area
It snowed \~3x but collectively it might have been \~6h of snow total
Once it snowed during the night and it was enough to cover everything white but the next day was like sunny 8°C and it all melted away by noon
I miss snow
Man those commercials are all over the place
You'll see them everywhere from state tv (HRT) to their homeland Nova TV
EDIT: Seriously you don't know how many times I've been tried to sold the new Dormeo mattress, or the super good Delimano pan and some walkmaxx shoes for my aching feet
Especially in the morning when only old people watch tv
I don't think you'll see it after 4 or 5 in afternoon
[I would say this one] it shows a tank of JNA going over a red Fiat 500 when the Serbian army was entering Osijek
A few years ago a "reverse" [monument] was made
Edited: city corrected, Thanks u/usecereni_kupus
It happened in Osijek, not in Vukovar
Anyone from Monaco here
Where is the Isle of Woman
Isle of Elder
im seeing a lot of germanic languages but for real tho, norwegian, 10/10
Finnish, more vowels the better it sounds
I once watched a movie which I liked, but the language wasn't familiar
I was very curious as I really liked how it sounded, but I've never heard of it
After I watched the movie I googled it
The language was Dutch
Only later was I aware of internet's hatred towards Dutch
I really love Portuguese
Slovenian
It sound like a Russian-Croatian mix without any vowels whatsoever
I don't think it's the most beautiful, but I find it interesting nonetheless
Happy cake day
Sretan dan kolača on Croatian
IDK if Habsburgs count as occupation, but we've also had a [Canadian PM] for about a year (technically born in Croatia, but spent most of his life in Canada and barely knows Croatian)
One Croatian PM was born in a Nazi concentration camp
Well, yes, we were under austrian or hungarian rule for almost 900 years
My History teacher tried to claim that people didn't have to vaccine their kids, that people die reguraly from vaccines and a few other easily debunkable arguments
I told her that those people were stupid and then argued with her for the entire class
In the end, she told me I, and I quote, "was not even in high school, so I had no right to pretend to be smarter than everyone and call anyone stupid".
My parents, who are doctors, were mildly pissed, but didn't take any action, because that'd just cause me trouble in school with the teacher
But both of them just said to call her retarded in her face if she tried to argue for something like that
I still hate that history teacher, since she had pretty much no idea of history, and was overall pretty dumb
I remember one time, She claimed to me that Austerlitz, with modern day borders, was in Austria
I told her it was in Czechia
I know because I literally went through there that summer
She then called me wrong and I had to shut up
She also said blatantly false things, but I honestly just gave up on correcting her
I can kinda see why she wouldn't accept the U.S. as an answer because, while it does indeed contain a metric fuckton of ethnicities, a person's ethnicity isn't really *that* relevant
But in countries like Spain (and much of Europe) it is considering ethnic minorities are native to the region and/or settled there in large numbers and kept their identity in a noticeable way
I guess it just depends on how you define multiethnic states, really
Because the vast majority become Americans culture-wise within a generation or two and are virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the population and don't speak the language of their parents/grandparents
Contrast that with ethnic groups like Basques or Catalans for example who speak a different language and are visibly distinct from the majority ethnic group
Besides, Norwegian-Americans eating lutefisk for Christmas doesn't classify as keeping their identity in a noticeable way if they have zero other links to the culture
Plus, when I say settled there I mean it in a 'planned' sense, like when Hungarians settled in the Pannonian basin i.e. when a large group of people with the same ethnic identity settle somewhere in a relatively short period of time
This is obviously different to settlement in America where individuals/families would move and then proceed to disperse around the country
Croat here, also attended "gimnazija" and was taught the grammar school translation
I found it later on to be a stupid translation, probably though up by some older generations, that even people form the UK (where grammar schools are from) don't necessarily get due to their education system beigh wildly different
Therefore, if I want be precise I say gymnasium (always in a context when it's known where I'm from so that it can be checked), otherwise I use secondary education or high school (as it's something that most people understand even if it's not the same)
Just checked on Wikipedia, grammar schools in the UK only exist in some parts of England and Northern Ireland and there are only 163 of them
So yeah, people from the UK probably won't get the right idea from comparing gymnasiums (in ex-Yu countries) to grammar schools
>Some old fashioned nickname was "Bundeshauptstadt ohne nennenswertes Nachtleben" (Federal capital without noteworthy night life)
Germans are so weird
The nickname is over 6 times longer than the name
Love you all
Well, most
I am so fucking dumb hahaha
We know it’s a holiday that exists but don’t actually celebrate it
I'd say one of the poems ( Slap, Oblak, Voćka poslije kiše) by Dobriša Cesarić.
"Gle malu voćku poslije kiše:
Puna je kapi pa ih njiše.
I bliješti suncem obasjana,
Čudesna raskoš njenih grana
"Look at the little fruit tree after the rain:
It is full of drops so it sways them
And it shines lighten by the sun
The wondrous splendor of its branches
The poem is called "Voćka poslije kiše". But, unfortunately, it is very hard to translate it, so it doesn't lose the meaning
In Croatia, we don't have much poetry, but one of the most famous song lines is:
"No rakije, rakije, rakije, amo
Jel utjehe nema u vodi
( Moonshine, Moonshine, give us moonshine,
Because there is no comfort in water )
It basically talks about a group of poor people, that drink to try to forget the state they live in
I’m gonna go with these:
“Čovječe, pazi da ne ideš malen ispod zvijezda
“Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man
” - from a poem called Opomena (Warning), by Antun Branko Šimić
“O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,
dar u kôm sva blaga višnji nam Bog je dô,
uzroče istini od naše sve slave,
uresu jedini od ove Dubrave,
sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki životi
ne mogu bit plata tvôj čistoj lipoti
“O beautiful, o beloved, o sweet freedom,
God has given us all the treasures in you,
you are the true source of all our glory,
you are the only decoration of this Dubrava
All silver, all gold, all human lives
cannot repay your pure beauty
” - from Dubravka, a play by Ivan Gundulić
“Slobode koji nema, taj o slobodi sanja”
“He who does not have freedom, dreams of it” - Moj dom (My home), Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević
“Što se bijeli u gori zelenoj
Al su snijezi, al su labudovi
Da su snijezi, već bi okopnuli
labudovi već bi poletjeli
Nit su snijezi, nit su labudovi
nego šator age Hasan age
“What's so white upon yon verdant forest
Snow perhaps it is or swans assembled
Snow would surely long ago have melted
And a flight of swans would have departed
not swans, not snow it is you see there,
'Tis the tent of Aga, Hasan Aga;” - Asanaginica, by Ivan Mažuranić
And then there is also the poem Horvatska domovina, which later became the national hymn
But still being the first to come to see if they're OK after wiping out
don't raise 3 fingers and yell "THlIS IS SERBIA", you will just get fucked up
You can guess what country im talking about
In what damn fantasy world do you live in ?
Oh, I see
Finland
dafaq
My friends and I don't like it
My theory that could be wrong is it's popular because most people in western europe or good percentage of it is renting their flat
This way flat owner doesn't care for the quallity of furniture and people moving in also don't care since it's not their place
I consider it over-priced low quallity furniture I wouldn't buy
However my cousin is a fan of ikea, she had hand made furniture made from oak, she  threw it out from her flat and bought everything in ikea
Just don't mention the war
Any war
Just don't mention it
It was an F117A, if I remember correctly, and Serbs were good sports about it, they apologized for not knowing it was supposed to be invisible
Luckily I've seen neither
Like one big, happy, disfunctional family
Yes
So you're saying that it's so deeply ingrained with people that our identity is to be the synonym for everything bad and repulsive that there's not even a point in trying to change that
Well isn't that excellent
>I’m saying that it’s ingrained enough that it’s not a “new”
I don't see how that changes anything
>and isn’t really offensive
Well perhaps not to you, I for one don't enjoy my identity being the butt of every joke and the general synonym for everything negative
Especially don't enjoy hearing it every 5min
I don't think we have them in Croatia but I really don't like the idea of those bases since I consider that Europe could defend itself if a EU army was created
Also I don't think it is the best idea to have foreign troops on our land, no matter the NATO because alliances can break over time and we might not keep our "good" relations with USA
But considering that the talks over creating united European army are going nowhere I guess it is normal that the countries that feel threatened want some kind of assist in defence
Do you consider only hot spice as spice
Mediterranean cuisine is full of local herbs and spices
You don't have to eat overpowering and hot third world spices to have spicy food
Not to mention that a Mediterranean diet is much more healthy as those hot spices are risk factor for stomach cancer
Sweden and every eastern blocc country
I'm sort of on a carolus rex high and I've always been interested in the eastern blocc
Turks tried to capture Vienna twice but failed
Matthias Corvinus did it on the first try
Most likely [the Battle of Sisak]
Pffff, there's only one correct answer to this question
Go back to 1683 to witness the last charge of winged hussars, the biggest cavalry charge in history
I know, i know, it was around vienna but still counts as polish history
My god that must have been a sight to behold
Imagine the ottomans shitting their pants when the polish came like gandalf over the hill with his rohirrim
Would be cool to check out etruscans to the north as well and see what carthage was actually like
I'm a big fan of those poor guys
Trust me, you dont want that
My first modem was 33
6 kbps, downloading mp3s from napster for 30 minutes per song, minimum
And better hope nobody calls the phone and your mom answering because your connection goes down immediately
Forget about online videos, they are non existant since nobody can load that in time
Chat rooms were the biggest and only fad, i remember going to microsoft chatroom which looked like a comic book, was a really cool design
It looked like [this] you could choose the facial expression as you type
Tbh i dont remember anything else, there were only chatrooms and napster (later came limewire and few others), and ICQ which was something like steam friends list, minus all the games
I can't even recite my own nations anthem let alone other nations anthems
That being said I could probably recognise a few of them if I hear them
eh i only know the first part of the serbian anthem thats it
I know quite a lot of them
Montenegrin, Russian and French anthems are among my favourites
I also know God save the Queen, the German, Serbian, Polish and Italian anthems and some more
I also like the tune of the Spanish one, I wish it had lyrics because I would love to sing to it
The French anthem is kind of a symbol of revolution and such so we know i. Other ones that I know are British, Russian, Spanish(I could recognise it but not sing), Serbian, German and Ukranian (cuz I wondered but same as Spanish tho only recognisable)
Same here
Also Spanish (not so frequent lately, but maybe next year) and Austrian
I also really want to hear La Marseilleaise on F1 podium
Exactly the same
Same here
But I must say, those who have worked hard and fairly don't do it as much the upstart ones
Usually the ones showing off (with branded clothes, big houses and expensive cars) have some sort of complex
Member the time when Kerum placed his Mercedes Maybach behind a window so people can look at it in awe and admire
What
You forgot about the croats
People who moved to germany (especially older people since it's kinda archaic state of mind) like to buy a german car (audi, bmw or mercedes) and then show off when they come back to their village
Like look at me, i made it
Even tho he's busting his ass off mixing concrete on the building site the whole day
Yeah, you made it, good for you
Gasterbajteri, gotta love their mindset
Zabranjena ljubav, a not very good soap opera that ran from 2004 to 2008 plus one more season in 2011, it has a measly total of 805 episodes
More or less, everybody in Croatia doesn't understand two of them, some three
And one little speech nobody understands - Bednjanski
There are so many dialects in Croatia, and a lot of them that people from different regions wouldn't understand
Unfortunately, a lot of these are sometimes based around one or few villages, and are dying out
Yes, but its not just an accent, it's the whole different dialects
[Here's an example]
[And another one with seasonal greetings]
I didn't understand a single word in the first example, aside from the last sentence which I think meant "Give evryone a Žuja (Croatian beer brand)"
Funny, I'm not from the NW Croatia so I didn't have much contact with those dialects, but I managed to understand a good bit
I'd say Bednjanski "mangles" vowels (compared to the regular Croatian) in the way similar to how Bavarian or Austrian does compared to regular German
Here in Croatia we have a lot of snow in specific areas (the north and the mountains, mostly), but where I live (Istria in western Croatia) it snows maybe once a year
I don't think it's that frowned upon
My sister has one on her nose and noone seems t ogive a damn
I personally dont use anything for thousands (maybe space if its illegible)
I tend to use dots for decimals, simply because it's easy to confuse commas when listing numbers with decimals
But I really dont know the official rule
We don't really do thousand separstors
Though sometimes youll see just a regular space used
We also use dots instead of commas
Here we use it "interchangeably", but the correct way to use it is "," for thousands separator, and "." for the decimal point
Didn't know you use points
Rest of exYugoslavia and Europe mostly uses commas
In Croatian you are supposed to have space as the thousands separator (but only 10 000 and above, 9999 would not have a space) and comma as the decimal
I personally have always used space and a decimal dot whenever writing
That’s what I was told in calculus class, but I think the dot is the only decimal separator in mathematics, so that’s the reason our teacher used dots
We do that too:
Milijun      - 1
000
000
Milijarda  - 1
000
000
000
Bilijun       - 1
000
000
000
000
Bilijarda   - 1
000
000
000
000
000
After a quick search, I found that it's a matter od using large or small numbering scale
Majority of European countries use the bigger scale, including us
UK, USA and some others use smaller scale
I suppose smaller scale is popular (even though less people use it) due to popularity of english language, and their cultural influence as per usual
In school i dont recall using anything except space
As communists
Trying to explain that it's not the same takes to much time and it's basically pointless
If you're not Catholic, you're not Croatian - that's the default view for most people
So, I'm a communist
I think it’s quite normalized
My parents grew up in Yugoslavia with the policy of state atheism, even though they still practiced Catholicism
Because they were three dominant religions in the ex-Yu area, it was also quite normal to hear of an atheist child, whose parents came from two different religions
Even today, 50 years later, being an atheist isn’t really a big deal
There are more and more atheists, and I’d say that in my school more than half of the people are atheists, or are going to become one
This is how I view the situation, coming from a fairly liberal family and school, but someone older than me might disagree
As someone already wrote, people (especially older) mark you as a communist and not a real Croat
What is even more interesting, young people are often even more extreme about it, even though they may not practice religion that much
I've witnessed a situation between friends where someone was verbally attacked because they said something about God that the other person didn't like
Church has hold over many things in Croatia, heck, they are even exempt from determined dates of relaxing the coronavirus measures, state is powerlees against them, many priests have been conducting masses despite the ban, and when police and journalists showed up they were attacked and hurt both by people and the priest
The most common judgement would be Orthodox communist
Just pictures of him digging for nose gold
I say Budapest with an "s" but I know it is supposed to be a "sh" sound
In Croatian we say Budimpešta for Budapest and as you can assume the letter "š" is pronounced as "sh"
In Hungarian I think "sz" is for "s" and "s" is for "sh"
I would go with Arabic because of the beautiful complexity; Spanish because it's widely used and finally Irish because when i heard it it doesn't sound like any familiar language to me
Have a nice day people
In my local bar, you can pour water in your glass over the bar if a lot of people are being served currently, altough it's a small bar where most of the time people from village only come
Yup, when one regular died, a candle was lit in front of the bar and everyone that could went to his funeral
All police officers that are on patrol carry a sidearm (either HS2000, CZ 75 or Glock 19), but in certain situations (usually after some incidents) they can be seen carrying Ero submachine gun or M70 rifle
Handguns are part of standard uniform
Long rifles are only present during some barricades, armed prsuits etc
I love how Americas get to be one continent due to Panama canal, but Africa is always taught separate from (Eur)asia even though there is Suez there
In Zagreb, around 5-10% of the total amount of sidewalks have bike lanes
This is a very rough estimate
I guess the infrastructure is really bad, because a few of my close friends have been run over by a car while crossing a road on a bike
Bonus: bikes also get stolen a lot (source: friends whose bikes got stolen)
Bikes get stolen a lot everywhere
50 thousand bikes get stolen every year in Amsterdam alone
Zagreb is not even close to that number
Yeah, the infrastructure in Zagreb is really bad
Even if the bike lanes exist, it is probably not intended for bikes (high roadsides etc
Source for Zagreb
I can't find the info
I found this article
383 bikes stolen in 2015
NOT EVEN CLOSE lol
True, but I think this number is still too low
Might be because of the low confidence in the police or because there is a minimum value of the bike (I don't know a lot about that, but I heard that police are not going to look into the case if the value of the stolen things is less than a few thousand kunas)
Thanks for the article
It would also be interesting to compare how many people are bikeowners in Amsterdam in comparison to Zagreb
"Gore gore gore gore"
means "Up there the mountains are burning worse"
In Istrian (Chakavian) dialect there’s this joke:
What does an Istrian say about a black man in the dark
“Ni ga
” (Read: knee-gha)
“Ni ga” translates to “He isn’t here (or there)”
Yes we are awful
Also: “Up up up up”
But that's awesome
How is it pronounced
Maybe not everybody knows all of these, but anyone who knows just a bit about our history has heard of them:
- Dukes Trpimir, Domagoj and Branimir
- King Tomislav (the first Croatian king)
- King Petar Krešimir IV
(the strongest Croatian king)
- King Dmitar Zvonimir (last king of the Trpimirović dynasty, whose death resulted in dynasty wars, which ended with Croatia and Hungary joined in a personal union)
- King Petar Svačić (the last Croatian king, killed in battle by the Hungarians)
- Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan (members of the Croatian-Hungarian movement against Austrian centralism and absolutism)
- Nikola Šubić Zrinski (the defender of Sziget against Ottomans)
- Ban Josip Jelačić (leader of the revolution against the Hungarians in the 19th century)
- Ljudevit Gaj (the creator of modern day Croatian grammar, invented our modern latin alphabet by adding the letters š, ž, č, ć, đ and others)
- Stjepan Radić (fighter for equality of Croats in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia)
- Ante Pavelić (leader of the Nazi puppet state during WW2, probably the most infamous one)
And of course:
- Josip Broz Tito (president of Yugoslavia)
- Franjo Tuđman + all presidents of Croatia since 1991
I know Wilhelm Tell from playing cards
Is this harald the same dude as harald hadrada
Because i'm reading the lists and everyone has at least 1 leader from civilization series
>I doubt a lot of people know why it's named after him and what he accomplished in his life
Big badda-boom
Schnappsen is German word I believe
See bottom right, this is standard German cards deck
I think another Croatian said it somewhere around here recently: "It's not a start of a turist season until a drunk Brit falls of the balcony"
No, czech are the brits of croatia
They are the ones climbing mountains in flipflops, drifting away on inflateable matresses etc
Nah, it's mostly the Czechs who do that kind of stuff here
Not impressed
Blatant disrespect of other people's customs and culture
The lads do that thing in the UK thinking that dressing up as a woman is some sort of hilarious joke no one ever thought of before
They also love attention when they are drunk so that's why
I guess I understand why people don't like it from a language learner's perspective
It takes some time to learn how things work, and some things by memory because they seemingly have no rules, but I personally love it
It's smooth as fuck, sounds amazing when sung, and as someone who has trouble with learning rules, it was the perfect language to pick up by ear
I like the way you can turn one word type into another and just mash words together to make a new one
Spelling and pronunciation inconsistencies suck, though
The fact you can't know what some word sounds like from how it's written is awful
is really fun to make fun of english as a languge you put on a russian accent or any other one and say the dumbest shit you can think of in english and it instantly becomes 10 times more funnier
Oh boy, wait till you learn about croatian spelling
You gonna love it
For example lets use Bordeaux
You pronounce it bɔːrˈdoʊ so we's just spell it Bordo, no complications, no extra letters, nothing
What you see you read out
I'm using maybe the wrong example since we'd actually spell it Bordeaux because it is a name
Serbs, on the other hand, went a step further and they spell everything, including names, like they pronounce them
"Fuck you, you fuck
No -ing, but I love it
“It’s better to live 100 years as a lion rather than a day as a sheep
Dacia makes cheap cars for the masses, so that's a positive view
As an exclamation point how shit have we become that you're passing us on some EU statistics (especially GDP per capita)
"We're behind Romania now

I'm from Sisak and there's many of them but the biggest is a ffortress called Old Town
In 1593 Croats fought Ottomans there and if Croats were to lose, Ottomans would've had a clear path to Vienna
Oh my God, lucky you
I’m in love with Heidelberg
I visited once and hope I’ll get to go to university there (*fingers crossed*)
For Zagreb, I guess the historical landmark is the cathedral (the cathedral honestly can’t catch a break: it was ruined in 1880 after an earthquake, and this past Sunday one of its spires fell apart after an earthquake)
In my city Valpovo we have a [castle]
In croatian several words for different sized hammers are čekić (chekich) and bat
I wouldn't call 'čekić' particularly strong
Like you have the hard č at the beginning but ending it with a soft ć kinda ruins it
Čekič. Check-itch
Older word is mlat, which means "beat" (mlatiti = to beat)
I think both are hammery enough
čekić [tschekitch]
an old word for it is also mljat [mlyaet]
Northern parts of Croatia use "kladivec" as a word for hammer
Honestly 'vasara' sounds like it'd fit right into our language
I'd feel very cool saying "Idem po vasaru"
There is also the word "kladivec", mostly used in the Northern/central parts of Croatia
Čekić najjača.
in croatian cura means girlfriend and in polish daughter if I'm not mistake čn. or is it cora
Never heard of it ;)
I highly doubt they aren't
In croatian officially it is kćer but kćerka is widely used
Fish sausages would be invented by Slavonians in Dalmatia
Zagreb wouldn't change at all

Sometimes, but I do not really care
You can't even have the concept
Each letter sounds the same, no matter the word or letter placement
The way our language works is that the way you pronounce each letter of an alphabet is the same when you pronounce it within a word
It would be totally pointless
We might have a generally phonetically consistent language, but many people struggle with ije/je and č/ć, so it's not totally innate to spell some words accurately
This is why i protest to add the letters ģ,ļ and ń to the alphabet so it can truley be 100%
Thats a tehnical distinction it isnt a phonemic one nobody thinks of the n in banka and nikola as diffrent sounds except linguists
it like how russians dont distinguish between č and ć
ч in лучше makes the sound č and in чуть it makes the sound ć but if you look on the wikipedia for russian phonology you wont find č listed as a phoneme and č and ć are wiriten the same way even tho they are tehniclly difrent becuse the diffrence isnt phonemic
thats mostly just the fact that in some dilactes č and ć are becomeing more simmilar and that ije in words is getting pronounced jeː if you speak a dialect were č and ć arent becomeing simmilar and where ije isnt pronounced jeː then its easy
A lot of Croatians don't have these expectations, although a lot of young people do move out
Especially those who don't live in the capital, but come here to study, most of them find jobs and permanently remain here
As for getting married and double standards, greatly depends on the family
A lot of families in Croatia still have fairly "traditional" views, and I think women are expected to settle and get pregnant sooner than men are, but both are expected to do these things before or at around, I believe, 30
"When are you getting married" is a pretty common question lol
I'd use my own examples, but my family is not very family like, so I don't get bothered with such questions either
Zagreb: incomers from Bosnia and Herzegovina
Zagorje: alcoholics
Istria: separatists
Dalmatia: lazy apartment renters
Lika: sheep herders
Slavonia: left to Germany a long time
In Croatia from my perspective (I'm form Zagreb)
&#x200B;
* Zagreb: snobs who think they are better than everyone else
* Split: Croatia's Florida, but with a lot more thugs 'n' drugs
* Zadar: they just don't seem to care
* Dubrovnik: hostile service industry that requires your firstborn for at most a shit burger
* Osijek: the closest thing to a city Slavonija has
&#x200B;
* Slavonija: hardworking people, empty fields, tons of emigration
* Dalmacija: laid back lazy people, but they go from 0-100 really quickly so shit can get intense (see Split)
* Zagorje: drunkards even by the countries standards (and we drink a lot)
* Istra: they're kinda just doing their own thing and nobody seems to care about it
* Lika: there are more dead than alive people there at this point tbh (just the way Nagash likes)
&#x200B;
if i remember any later i'll make sure to edit them in
Don't forget the communists in Istria
Yeah seriously what's up with that
I know a lot of commies from there
Tbh I don't know and I'm from there
I remember seeing a map of Tito busts in Croatia and all of them were in Istria
It's very interesting and exciting actually
Radius of 100km gets me to one neighbouring country, 200km to another three countries, 400km to two more and 600km to two-three more
And it's all so diverse
German/Austrian/Swiss Alps, few central European Slavic countries + Hungary, Italian/French villages, Adriatic sea and its islands in Croatia
so many different cultures, languages, food, history, perspectives
A lot to explore amd everything on just 1-6hrs long drive
But I am also amazed by US size and nature
Each part of the country is (visually) different from another
Take Alaska, Hawaii, Rocky mountain, central plains, Appalachian mountains, cold nort east, wild north western nature, deserts, aligators and swamps on the south
simply amazing
That's so crazy to hear
You can drive straight through Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Finland for more than 12 hours and still be in the same country
The biggest difference in Europe is that you'll pass through a couple of different dialect areas, a completely different climate in the opposite ends of the country and a completely different culture from where you started
I like Wiena
I think Zagreb had potential to become like it however 20 years of systematic neglecting and criminal activites has destroyed the city on top with recent earthquakes
I would take from wiena metro system, keeping their city center buildings in a good shape
Also waste menagment which is here absolute shite
My country lacks so many good things but nature aint one of that
You can just drive randomly anywhere in Croatia and you will hit a national, regional, nature park or something interesting within minutes
If you think those examples are ugly I got news for you, buddy
They look fine compared to communist brutalism
I would call the first one even pretty
I have to disagree
I live in a building from 1983
And part of my neighborhood is olde commie part
Planners invited sociologists to give their opinion
38 years after my part of the hood has plenty of parks, trees, and even space for cars, remember it was built inn1983
The old part has 26 buildings while new part from this capitalist era, has 52 buildings, only one school and one kidnergarten
My part has đmuch bigger school and 6 kindergartens, 4 city owned and 2 private ones
same goes for other parts of the city
If I have to live in a building I will search for commie ones
Sometimes I forget how many russians you have
This looks bad, similar to our older commie buildings but they put trees between them
This guy is quite popular
This video in particular is older part of my neighborhood, english subs are available
Tbh I like Vaike-Oismae
Just asked my sister, she visisted latvia, lithuania and estonia in 3 separate trips and said that indeed some commie blocks look bad
Yes
My city experienced, just recently, a strong earthquake and it damaged a lot of old town because some buildings(Edit: MANY buildings) are a couple hundred years old and they were not build with modern standards
Also, a railway or metro can be a problem to build in centers of old towns because the streets are to small
And also, a lot of buildings are cultural goods and are protected which is, on one hand, good because you cant build modern buildings there and destroy the historic town but on the other hand its bad because you need a lot o permits to renovate them
Yeah all the time
Most people are voting *against* and not *for* a certain party or candidate
I think that's understandable
Hehe, šmigus dingus
I think people using national unifications of Italy and Germany and Francization of minority languages in France as examples of how regional identities would disappear are totally missing the point
These were nation states, who's explicit goal was to unify their people by forcing a common standardized language in schools
Thus the local dialects faded away
Correct me if I'm wrong but a United EU wouldn't be forcing a common pan-European language on everyone
We'd just go on business as usual except the EU institutions would have more powers
Regulations, too many regulations about food and drink
Croatia, Slavonia and Baranja
Before entering EU we baked (Distilled) Rakia in much larger quantities than now, it was made both for personal consumption and sale to those in close proximity to us, and it was something about which you could brag about, now taxes are too high for it, so less and less people do it, you even have to pay taxes even if you only have the necessary equipment and you didn't distill it that year, so most people sold their equipment, while other's that continue to distill it, do so in hiding
Of course there are big companies that create it legally, but most of the time it's too weak and lack flavour, it's not traditional so to say
There was also a scare about making zimnica, which is a tradition where at the end of summer, most of the vegetables are stored in special way in jars with vinegar that are sealed and then they are ready for consumption anytime during winter
Other example, due to outbreak of African swine fever, heavy regulations regarding the slaughter of pigs that is incoming soon with Kolinje in Slavonia, Kolinje is a tradition whereby when winter is coming, we  slaughter pigs, then in traditional kolinje every part of the pig is used and preserved through some way, fat is cooked and stored for further use, we make čvarci, smoke different types of foods, even pigs insides are used, their intestines are cleaned out and then minced meat is filled inside of it with seasonings to prepare for smoking sausages, hooves are cooked and readied as Hladetina for consupmtion during winter and etc
You can read more about it [here] Anyway during the entry of Croatia into EU, there were fears that heavy regulations would be imposed making kolinje no longer doable, since everyone thought that everyone who wanted to slaughter pigs had to have neccessary conditions, which most could not afford to build
It was not done then, but it is being enforced now, and it is heavy, now most will not be doing kolinje this year and will have to resort to buying in stores the neccessary meat and etc
for consumption for the rest of the year, and this is something that was once done in every household but now is more and more dead
Then again we also have Casu Marzu situation in Italy, if you don't know what it is, google it, but basically it's Italian cheese that is outlawed since EU regulations deem it to be unsafe, and that is part of their food culture and was prepared like that for centuries
There are also fear about ''black face'', to explain, here in Croatia we also have Krampus, Krampus here, follows Saint Nicholas and has black face, he has a black face because he is demon with fur covering his face and he enters through chimneys which stains his face black, but most people only do black makeup over their face, it was not created as racist as we were never a big power, but there are fears that this tradition might be banned or at least pushed  out and replaced with something that western countries deem more appropriate, although this might already have happened since I think very few children today even know about this
"As one country, there would be one leader
And that leader would naturally favour certain things closer to their own culture" - no it wouldn't. Look at Balkans- Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and other parts -  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Hungary, Romanian, Czech republic and Slovakia, Ireland and to some degree Denmark, All small countries and leaders are easily influenced by promise of monetary help for support in EU parliament, so they can present it back home in their favor for more votes next election
And its not only people, they use it to promote political party for more votes to keep it on top next election
i cant believe but i agree with you :) EU would have to put a lot of money in some agency to extremely promote culture on local level or else, eventually language and culture will be lost
Its not something that will happen in 20 years but in 200 we will ask our self where did all that people go since then we will have like 200m of Germans, Italians and french and Spanish but no Estonians or Slovakians
Well if black face is not racially motivated, then there is no problem, I don't care if someone is offended even after being thaught that it was not made to be racist but due to depiction of demons
With work, kids, cooking, cleaning and occasionally unwinding with games or Netflix (or just staring at the screen blankly)
sometimes I do
Wow, that sounds like a really beautiful thing to take part in
Are there any specific places where people congegrate
Im from Croatia and this seems like a fun thing to see this summer
In Croatia it's difficult to point out single city
We have three distinctive regions
Coastal Croatia (Primorje, Dalmatia, Istria) was historically under huge Roman/Venetian/Italian influence and you can say that by architecture in any city
Rijeka and surroundings were later influenced by the Austrians but remained still distinctively coastal cities
There is also significant continental divide between the coast and the inner Croatia, the [Dinaric Alps]
Then we have central and north-western bit, where Croatian capital is
Historically under heavy Austrian influence, architecture and dialect have many resemblance to German language and the way the buildings look
If you put someone from coastal region next to the person from northern Croatia, they would have hard time understanding each other
Then there is east of the country, Slavonija
Many Germans also influenced that part a lot, but add Hungarians to the mix, you can tell it mostly by the food and how the villages are laid out
This is also where "high Croatian" dialect is spoken the most and is official dialect of Croatia
It's written in the way it's said
It's also better than the Serbian standard because we write foreign names like they're originally spelled
Slavic languages are also underrepresented as important languages
(No, Russia indeed does not, and has never existed
It's A CONSPIRACY
Also, I would really like it
QED
Sample: [
Some Belgian guy reading Croatian poorly: [
I mean if you count Croatia + Bosnia + Serbia, 16 million people is reasonably big
Although, of course, only if the Croatian standard is adopted, as it's the best
It's a rational language to learn because there's a fuckton of them and very few of you Danish people and us, and they have a huge influence over Europe that is only going to increase in the coming decades
Also they don't speak any foreign languages
NAMES
Personal and most cities
But there's some different version for a lot of major cities in Europe
And of course, names in other alphabets are transcribed
Roma language
They don't have their country and they live in Europe
Zrakoplov isn't the same as avion
Avion is a type of zrakoplov
How tf do you guys say tjeralica
Nope
For example "kann, cremen, sechs" all of these words have the "k" sound, but three spellings
Also you have way more than 5 vowel sounds
I would say that Italian is even easier than Spanish to pronounce because of the simple fact that it lacks the "th" sound like in "cerveza".
Also clock my flair but Serbo-Croatian is also very easy to learn how to pronounce (but harder to master because of the consonant clusters)
how do you say šišmiš lol
Please google it, because I sincerely hope Holandija isn't the official standard name
You're not joking:
Holandija is utter heresy
They should start calling Serbia "Vojvodina".
But seriously, do you know why
Can you use both in school or is cyrillic mandatory
Say in biology, do you have textbooks and reports in both scripts or is any preferred
I mean keyboard input and layout is the same
Just switch input language
Ustashe genocide most probably
Existing
Tbh as far as empires go, Austro-Hungarian one was *relatively* decent
Would rather be under them than under any colonial empire
One of the biggest fuck you is when you attempted to make Hungarian our (Croatian) official language
Any normal, sane person speaking a normal, sane language would flip a table at that moment
I think this is actually a pretty dumb sentiment
No matter how nice you treated Romanians or Serbs and how much language rights you gave them, if given a choice between their mother country and Hungary they'd always choose their mother country
Your mistake was giving them that choice by losing the war
I'd say your politicians randomly deciding to split the USSR was a way worse geopolitical tragedy for Russia than selling Alaska
Related to this, HSS just giving its whole state apparatus to the Ustaše in 1941
Everyone responsible for the genocide that the Yugoslav state could get its hands on was punished
Nothing was forgiven
I’d still say loosing everything Russia has fought for since the 1600s is a bit worse than loosing Alaska though
But yeah the breakup has been even worse for Central Asia, Moldova, Ukraine etc
Only Russia and the Baltics are doing ok
In Split where I'm from lower than 10°C is cold and higher than 28°C is hot, less than 5°C is too cold and higher than 34° is too hot
In Zagreb where I study heat tolerance is pretty similair but the reason why Zagreb has 10 times shittier wheater is colder half of the year
In span of less than two weeks temperature has gone from nice 16° to 8°, even 3° in the morning and late at night and it will not go back up for the next 5 months
At the same time Split has stable 14°-16° weather all day long and coldest months feel the same as autumn in Zagreb
It's probably one of the reasons why I can't see myself living here after finishing my studies
Cold - below 0
Chilly - 0-13ish
Nice - 14-22ish
Warm - 22-30
Hot - 30+
I'm from continental Croatia
And now when i think about it, consider all values to be an "ish". Always depends on the wind, humidity and all that stuff
We don't really know where the word for our country and people comes from and what does it mean
For instance in English Germany is called so because it was Latin for neighbour or Deutschland meaning land of the people
Theres a lot of theories going around for where the word comes from or what it means but there's a lot of disagreement going on
But just imagine if that Jewish Madagascar idea came to be
[Hajduk Split]
Biased as hell but it is a nice one
From Croatian clubs I really like the logos of [Lokomotiva] and [Gorica]
[NK Olimpija] is better
I live in Zagreb, and I think that [this song] would fit perfectly as a silent backing track for it, and the bonus is that the people who wrote the sing are from Zagreb as well
For old town Zagreb it must be Agrameri-[Ružo Crvena]
The rest is either [Stoka] or good old [Herzegovian Ganga] cuz so many people came from there to Zagreb
Which one
I'm a sucker for medieval Italy
I put Zagreb, Zagreb by Ivo Robić but that is pretty good too
I am giving you our football abilities
Croatia will be the perfect counter balance
People would punctually sip coffee during the work hours
[If my grandmother had wheels she would be a bike]
Not in a million years
I never understood that
Only germans like their bread, it's simply not eaten anywhere else, there are so many other breads that are way better and tastier
Their stray animals are drunk mooses (mees
) so i dont know how that is an improvement
Yeah, I've been with my girlfriend, and it's kinda amusing I guess, but nothing special
I was actually never in the Technical Museum
We pledge we'll go every year, and then somehow end up never going lol
Yeah, I've heard it's amazing
I mean, there's technically the museum night event, but the crowd is always by far the worst at the Technical museum haha
We also eat soup every day here in Croatia
We have that in Croatia
Kinda shocked it's not what everyone has
Probably a Balkan thing
It's also a thing in Croatia
Pretty sure that's not exclusive to germany
And Pepsico introduced Schwip-Schwap
While there's only one version of MezzoMix, there's lemon flavour, sugarfree and sugarfree + caffeine free Schwip-Schwap
Not to mention all the cheap cola + orange versions in Lidl, Aldi etc
Well, we also do that in Croatia
I can confirm you can buy it in Croatia, but only in Müller stores
I can confirm you can buy it in Croatia, but only in Müller stores
In the balkans it’s čorba
Yes, you are responsible for the Terminator
Okay
>but I wonder how meaningful that distinction would be to a Congolese person
That's not the point though
The point is blaming Belgium over something it had no control over
It's like blaming the US over what Trump does in his private property in other countries
Belgium didn't colonize the Congo Free State for fuck sake though
They only took over decades later **specifically to stop the crimes**
>Which is something they could have done much, much earlier
But they choose not to
Wha what
Where do you get this BS from
Do you just make it up along the way
No it was initially not known at all to the wider public what was happening
There were few reports and they were all conflicting
Once what was actually happening became widespread knowledge, the Congo was confiscated from Leopold
Honestly I always thought that Friuli- Venezia Giulia is autonomous because of strong regional Friulian identity not becaue of slovenes . I remember as a kid traveling there quite often so those hills in that region always make me chuckle when I travel trough that region
Thing is if I travel to western country  Italy is always a country that I need to pass, so after being in a state of half hunger after Spain or France Italy is a first stop where I stuff food into myself
In 2019
I was so hungry after a week in Paris so when I landed in Treviso, first ordered pizza then in Venezia ordered cuttlefish spaghetti
In 2013
after visiting both spain and france I was so hungry that  I ordered half a chicken and pasta on some highway bistro, payed like 21€ but was so happy
Nice username
I guess you also have problem with local sheriffs
I had everything planned to visit Milano last year in April but corona and shit and concert was of course post-poned
So if vaccination starts on a larger scale and things come back to some normality
friends and I are planing either Rome, Sicily (because I'm a huge fan of Andrea Camilleri) or Moscow-Sankt-Peterburg
Still can't decide
Rijeka doesn't have sizeable Italian minority but Istria has, so bilingual signs are implemented even if Italians don't make 33% of the municipality
Not you but slovenian muncipalities, guys that have too much power
Nice username was just a statement
If you keep the religions freedom we maybe be cool with it
The Illyrian provinces would be right across the river (since I live in Zagreb)
Otherwise I would be in H. M.
I would live 500 meters north of the french border
Probably make my living as a smuggler
Well, you built roads, bridges and fountains in Dalmatia and you helped publish [the first newspaper in Croatian] (and Italian) which promoted our local language instead of trying to remove it (like other foreign rulers)
Another comment mentioned that one of the main streets in Split, Croatia is named after the French general Auguste de Marmont and for some reason, even though it has declined, a town in Dalmatia called Imotski had a high rate of learning French in school instead of the usual German/Italian which is learned in Croatia because of the French roads that were built there
In Croatian we call them 'knedle' but are predominantly made with plums
They can be served with breadcrumbs like you mentioned, but also with cream
My favourite dessert for sure
Yeah man I love them
Plum ones are the best, apricot is for jam
We call them "marelice", probably from Austrian term "marille"
The entirety of [Dubrovnik]
Croatia is a country full of various foreign influences so its hard to pick one
I would say Zagreb Cathedral, Diocletian's Palace in Split and the Arena in Pula
Probably [St
Mark's Church]
I think the Diocletian's Palace would be the *one*. Sure, we have the Zagreb Cathedral and Arena of Pula, but I don't think anyone would recognize those
Not really a building, but the walls of Dubrovnik are very famous, combined with Dubrovnik as a whole
Also, Walls of Dubrovnik
Mountain bike, because paths here can be shitty, and if you're downtown, cobblestone streets are not comfortable for a bike without suspension
I feel like almost everyone here rides only mountain bikes
I use mountine bike to go to the gym and everywhere else i go
You can block the suspension on the fork so it acts like a city bike
Zagreb is not that flat, so gear shifter and suspension are a must, and a lot of people also like going somewhere with their bikes on the weekends, like climb a mountain or go along the river on a gravel or dirt paths
City bikes are cool for casual rides tho
You'd change your mind driving your bike in Croatia
At least late 8th century - 1102
1991 - today
We had 3 or even 4 if you count Kingdom of SCS Croatia
610 - 1102 (duchy to kingdom until PU with Hungary and later Austria)
1941 - 1945 Independent State of Croatia
1991 - present Modern Republic of Croatia
Croatia was not free during Nazi rule nor do we recognize that abomination
Well it was a country sooo
No, it wasn’t. It wasn’t free, wasn’t recognized, and didn’t even encompass whole Cro as they sold Dalmatia off
It was Nazi abomination that Croats don’t recognize
Read our Constitution
Frankfurt imo
That place just had a feel of emptiness and it didn't even feel like a german city
Just the combination of ugly modern buildings slapped right next to the older stuff just doesn't look good
And honestly the place itself barely felt welcoming, idk how to explain it
Rome as well
God I've never seen a dirtier capital city
Sure it has nice sights,but you literally cannot approach the majority to even see them because of the amount of people
The Vatican Museum was the worst tho - oh you want to see a painting or a sculpture
Well fuck you lol -the crowd literally pushes you and our local tour guide was just hurrying us too
The city centre is pretty nice, but I didnt feel too safe in the other areas of the town
I really like Belgrade and so do most other people here, but it's probably because of the similar culture
I went and it was good dk wtf they are talking about, it was clean and didnt smell bad
I didnt go when it was summer to avoid tourists
I went in April of last year
Assyrians, Akadians, Sumerians etc are done in a single lesson as a sequence of civiliziations in mesopotamia
Then Egypt and Phenycians
Then mostly Greece with short interlude about persians
Then Rome
Then short mention of several germanic tribes, vikings, etc
Its mainly greece and rome
Chinese or Indian or other Asian cultures are barely mentioned, as well as Central/South American - all of them are udually a single paragraph
Can confirm this
They are two completely different letters
I dont know IPA so h is like regular h in english (hurry, hide) or ch in loch ness
A is always pronounced the same, as in a in car, or (first) e in eye, I (without the y fadeout)
As an aside, we realy realy like H (country is named Hrvatska)
So it is common in names and many many abbreviations
I would like to visit them all eventually
Except for Turkey
Erdogan is a brainlet and I don't want to fund his gouvernment
But the rest of the country seems really good but I'm not going in there as long as hes there
Gladly
Oh yeah, I forgot about Orban
Well what interests me about russia is not really russia but the republics
What does that imply though
"Bogu iza nogu" - Behind gods feet
Or "Tunguzija" - Where the tungusic people live (Siberia)
We often say for someplace far in god knows where as Tunguzija which I thought was imaginary but is apparently a real oblast in Russia called the Tunguska oblast
Don't forget "vukojebina" which is translated to "place where wolves fuck".
"That place is far away" = "Ma to ti je tamo negdje u pički materini"
Plitvice lakes, Croatia
Park rangers telling people to exit because the visiting day is over
Japanese woman: "Aha, that's because you turn off the falls now".
She thought it's all artificial
Time for the maintenance of electric pumps
Yeah exactly
I worked in a store in a quite a touristy area and I would much rather have Americans getting our hellos wrong than the Italians or the French who would refuse to speak anything but Italian or French
I am from Croatia and I got a lot of upset French tourists who would get really upset when they realised I couldn't speak French
They would continue to speak French to me nonetheless but with a much more annoyed tone of voice
In effin Croatia was the most annoying part
We have almost no historical connections to that country nor a valid enough reason to be learning French en masse
Imagine that arrogance
Yes it did, I believe it was even labeled as breaking news by a few (those consider everything breaking news) but it was only mentioned on the day that it happened unlike the NZ shooting which is still mentioned
They are quick but they would also write for example: BREAKING NEWS: Ronaldo scores a hattrick
That is not breaking news material, at least not to me
Aren't carabinieri under jurisdiction of both ministry of defence and internal affairs/interior (however you call it)
I have a picture with carabinieri from my trip to Firenza in 2012
I like how your police drive AR 159 <3
Fuck, I'm laughing so hard
Thank you for the origin of aujourd'hui
That always interested me
As someone else pointed out "America" **the continent** had thousands of years of history with empires, religions, literature
While America **the country (USA)** and the territory it covers really didn't.
All the advanced civilizations of the Americas were in Central and South America, not north

Maybe a year younger if you go for vocational 3 year high school and now want to go to uni anyway
8 primary (mandatory) + 4 or 3 years of highschool
And you start age 6/7
The story (one of them, but the most popular) how my hometown, Zagreb, got it's name goes something like this
"A military commander who was passing through, exhausted and dehydrated, stopped at one point and dug his sword in the dry, cracked ground, out of despair, and water suddenly began gushing out of it
There was a girl by the name of Manda ( short for Magdalena, probably)
And the commander told her: "Mando, dušo, **_zagrabi_** vode" (Manda, sweetheart, grab me some water)
And that led to a town that soon developed there
So basically my hometown got it's name from the verb "zagrabi" which translates to grab
And if you've visited Zagreb, on the center square/plaza
You can see the well called "Manduševac", which got it's name from the girl (Manda) in the story, and from where the legend started
There is also the story (quite possibly the truth), how people called the town as "the town behind the hill" (Due to Zagreb being behind/next to the hill/mountain Medvednica)
Which translates to Croatian as (Grad i**za breg**/a)
Which through time ultimately lead to it's distorted name (Grad Zagreb)
( **iza brega** - **'za breg'** - **zagreb**)
It means River
Self explanatory since its on the mouth of the biggest river around the area
That's quite interesting
In Croatian "trg" = "square" and "market place" is quite similar too: "tržnica".
Never thought a name of a Finnish city would come from a Slavic word
I always liked the story about Manda and the commander, I know it’s probably just a myth but it sounds cool
I’ve never heard of the second theory though, and I’ve lived in Zagreb my whole life
Huh, I guess you do learn something new every day
Na vrh brda vrba mrda :)
The word "Prede" for it is the same in croatian
Hey, as someone who wants to study linguistics in France, what are the best universities for it ? Specifically, Computational linguistics
Merci d'avance
Hello my Slavic brother, as far as South Slavic nations go we don't have many creatures tied to water, we mostly have creatures tied to forest like Vile(benign fairies), the undead creatures such as vampires, young children spirits that died and cursed beings such as Vukodlak basically a werewolf but one created from curse that stems from killing a wolf (greatest sin in Slavic mythology)
there are some creatures from Slavic mythology listed [here]
>Waldemar Białecki's cancer treatment expenses would be mostly covered by insurance,
Good for Poland
Everyone that I’ve had ties with that got diagnosed with cancer in Croatia was told, “You’ve had a good, long enough life, so no point in trying to treat you
Go home and die peacefully and know that we’ll just use the money that we’re saving by not treating you on someone younger with another disease
Good bye
”  Kind of sucks to not at least try to make even a small effort to fight the cancer
We tend to speak standard in situations where you are unsure about other person or in official, formal situations
People usually wouldn't even try dialect with foreigners (on purpose)
It is mostly used in close settinhs, on green market etc
oh yeah, in formal settings especially i ditch my dialectal speech
my accent is still very recognizable, but not as much as it usually is, lol
If you are talking about NW then yes, we all switch to standard
The south on the other hand, not so much
And I don't think they'd be happy if you asked them to speak standard
The Great Question that burns across all of The Balkans

I didnt feel like mentioning it since he's already bombarded by everyone else
Glava, ramena, koljena i stopala (X2)
Oči, uši, usta i nos
Glava, ramena, koljena i stopala
Translation:
Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes (X2)
Eyes, Mouth, Ears and Nose
Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes
Stopala aren’t toes, they are feet
I have never heard this song in croatian as well
Oh, yea, you are right
Historically: Ante Pavelić - both incompetent and piece of shit human being
More modern: Ivo Sanader - your usual corrupt politician
This is actually very interesting as we in Croatia when we were studying history we were told that Oliver Cromwell was actually a good figure because he brought back parliamentary monarchism and stopped the absolute monarch Charles I. This might be due to the fact that we learn a very small part of English history
Happy cake day
Franjo at least suceeded in most of his endevours so I would say he was competent even if you disagree with his actions
At least Benedict Arnold's treachery was him flipping a bird at the people that fucked him over
Quisling was just a pro-Nazi fascist
We sometimes use diamond instead of rock because it goes better with paper and scissors though maybe that is just me and my town I know other places just use rock
I've always heard only "rock, paper, scissors" (kamen, papir, škare), "diamond" would be to long to say
Huh, I've never thought about how you guys say it
It's "kamen, škare, papir" in Croatian
It would go like: Pa-pir-Ška-re-Di-ja-mant
So you go like:one-two one-two one-two shoot, "mant" being the verse where we shoot
Kamen, škare papir goes: Pa-pir-Ška-re-Kamen in a rythm like : one-two one-two shoot, "kamen" being the word where you shoot
For me personally I don't care, papir, kamen, skare is shorter but kamen is too long for the shooting and papir, skare, dijamant is maybe too long
It's the same rhythm as in the English "Rock, paper, scissors" whereas we show the gesture on the "pa" part of "papir".
This sounds oddly, soul-crushingly familiar
highly depends on if i'm going to the store high or sober
That one day we'll be as prosperous as Switzerland
our prime minister of that time welcoming tourists:

Trump is an idiot
And the irony of Erdogan, a crypto-fascist calling the Netherlands one of the most liberal countries on earth "Nazis" went past all the heads of his supporters
Yes, when other countries start migrating to Mars we might reach the development index Switzerland had in 2019 haha
You've basically described Croatia and our diaspora
There are some of us Redditors 50+ with the first-hand experience with socialism in Yugoslavia
Coca-cola, jeans, rock music, records from the west republished same day, TV shows, a possibility for travel, foreign goods, on the other side excellent health care, education, vacations in the state-owned or company-owned facilities, socializing and friendship
Efficient use of public money, investments, production, perspective
Absence of nationalism and religion in public life, a secular republic and equality before the law
That was not so good, so we decided to tear it all down, install nationalistic pro-nazi oligarchies of greedy imbeciles, install idiotic priests that preach hatred and crime, introduce corruption, theft, hatred, and greed as the highest virtues on all levels, bring back all the ghosts of the past that we had once defeated and giggle in that sewer of pride with our "democracy" and "capitalism" and especially the new-found "freedom". Since we are never happy with our achievements, now we move away and emigrate in large numbers from that pot of shit
To be honest, not all was great but as any time it had it's pros and cons and I find it silly to generalise
The biggest setback we had was the wars in the 90's. Even if we didn't want to be in a state together, we could have peacefully split apart
If anybody is interested in the comparison of live before and now
I recommend watching Goran Milić's documentary series Tada i Sada:Hrvatska, BiH i Srbija
Not just travel, it was the best passport in the world at that time, it gave you access to both west and east, i dont know if any country had that
Or, in Djole's words "crveni pasos bez mane sto prolazi grane bez puno njakanja".
I wouldnt say it was better back then because a) i was born in '85 so i dont have a lot of XP on that matter, b) we have more opportunities now for sure
But the thing is everyone had something back then and now a lot of people dont have anything while few have too much
Nope
Hunt for "srbocetniks" and "ustasa" is a neverending task that keeps on the fog while they are stealing, pillaging and robbing
It was a limited market, but unlike the so-called Eastern Bloc, it was a market
For example, in Yugoslavia existed the companies that produced the same product that would compete
Even foreign, license made products
In the beginning, there were five-year plans and planned production, but it was abandoned in the sixties
There was even a movement of the workforce, you could go and work in any other part of the federation
But companies were - since 1950 - created as a worker co-ops where a manager had to manage along with the worker's councils
Those ideas you could find among so-called Western Marxists and some anarchists
Workers participation
There was even a private sector
You could have a private company with up to 10 workers
It was not only reserved for services but also existed in production
So, the word private was not only applied to personal property, but you had some privately owned sector in the economy
Yugoslavia had a large and developed production out of the classical socialism heavy industry
The industry of consumer goods and those goods had to fight on the market, for the client
Therefore we had marketing
One thing more was the foreign policy, the namely non-aligned movement, which opened a big window for the companies to go on the world market and compete for the projects
Large ones
Yugoslav companies worked in may non-aligned countries of Africa and Asia earning hard currency and thus making that type of socialism possible
Our workers could work abroad for a better salary using that system, or simply going to work in West Europe
Travelling abroad was a norm for anyone, every citizen
All those benefits and advantages melted in the wars of the nineties
All our economic advantage was erased, and we were even reduced back to the seventies
For example, average purchasing individual power in Croatia today is even worse than in 1978
And the pace of the development, except maybe that of Slovenia, is modest and insufficient
Croatia, as a second economy of the former Yugoslavia, is by most of the parametres today worse than Romania or Bulgaria
It is last in the EU
Yes, tourism keeps our head above the water, but the country is de-industrialized and literally has no perspective
Emigration, especially among young people, is high
25 % of Croats today live abroad
In Bosnia is even worse, with some 45 %. The difference, an important one, with the emigration in the times of Yugoslavia, is that today people go not to return
In the old times, they would work, mostly in Germany, but would build their family house in Yugoslavia
Today, they pack their family with them and simply go
There are not many sources online in foreign languages about this sad story
Politically, it is not wise to label yourself as yugo-nostalgic
Then they label you as a Stalinist communist
Which is totally absurd
Even our current president is publicly crying how Yugoslavia was "behind the Iron curtain" and that communism was endless darkness while in reality as a teenager she went to high school in the USA
Right-wing political agenda is to persuade us how the era of socialism and Yugoslavia was horrible, literally concentration camp and how they brought the light of capitalism and ended that inhumane system
Truth is just the opposite
Illustration: only ONE company from my town produced 3,5 million pairs of shoes for the Russian market
A year
At the same time making Adidas for the German market
It had 1200 workers
Today there is a commercial center Lidl with 15 employees - on the same spot
We had DOZENS of companies like that in my town
My town in Croatia turned from successful industrial one into the darkness-after-7-in-the-evening town
Unemployment 30 %. Drunks everywhere

Two meanings: either something is generally very unlikely to happen, or it is used in the context that an evil person does not go against another bad guy, in other words, criminals help each other
Ja u kupe ti u špade
Means sth like "we're playing different card suits" - "we can't come to an agreement/we're talking about different things", it refers to the card games tresette and briscola

"Ko pod drugim jamu kopa, sam u nju upada" is my personal favourite
Literally translated it means "He who digs a hole beneath someone falls in it himself" Basicallydon't sabotage others
Got a mild stream of air through my nose
Yep, it is a joke for some times now
In ex yu countries and Bulgaria i think i would be fine
Serbia, bosnia, montenegro and (in lesser extent) slovenia would be fine
I also speak a bit of italian and german so i guess i could communicate with people who speak those languages
When i think about it i believe czech and slovak would work too because when i was a kid growing up in a popular tourist place i met a lot of czech people (we were chasing girls a lot back in the days) and we could communicate with each other without using english
I learned a lot of czech words that way as well
Unless broken german is good it isnt gonna do me much good

22° or so
Under 20 kinda sucks, and this is by far my least favourite season
Now I'm really curious: how do you survive without heating
Do you at least use electric heaters
Do you freeze to death when you get out of a shower
I really didn't know that the climate is so mild there, so it makes more sense now
I always thought it'd be much colder than here
Why aren't you in Customs Union atleast
Meanwhile, UK is trying to become new Norway/Switzerland
That is alright, I guess
But what about tariffs for other EU states on your own stuff
Like what if I wanted to buy a jacket from Norway
Since the salaries up there are HUGE, I guess the price wouldn't be low
Lets say some $800
With tariffs is $1100
No good
It is good to support national brands, though
Atleast Boris could open borders to us, he comes to our country every year almost
There is word that got extremely popular in last decade
It's the word *uhljeb*, first time used on an [ultras transparent] in a football game back in 2008
It denotes a person with parasitic tendencies, most commonly associated with bureaucracy, nepotism, pen pushers in public system and people who get everything in life by brandishing party membership card
Nowadays you can see it in almost any social media post and articles criticising government or system in general
*Here is an article in english ["Uhljeb – a post-socialist homo croaticus: a personification of the economy of favours in Croatia
"] by Ružica Šimić Banović discussing the context
Susramlje, basically the same thing
Capital Zagreb, i can walk alone as a female almost everywhere in my city(maybe one neighbourhood is tricky but still i dont think i would be attacked)
The same goes for the rest of the country
I am more afraid od stray dogs or wild animals than people
Croatia (100k ish people)
I would say its pretty safe
I walked home alone at night many times and never had problems
Street attacks/muggings are very rare
I would say that applies to the country in general because I had no bad experiences in the capital either
Although there are a few locations in my city (such as an abandoned factory complex or illegal shacks city) where i wouldnt consider myself safe or comfortable at night
I live in an average sized town called Varaždin (45k people)
Going outside and getting robbed is very hard, but it does happen sometimes
Places with less than 100 thousand people are pretty safe, but i’m not sure what it’s like for large cities like Zagreb (800k people) or Rijeka (130k people)
Are you talking about Kozari Bok
I remember in 2008 being drunk in the middle of vienna and singing "osterreich, osterreich, alles ist vorbei" after we won that football game
Not even a dirty look
Yes I am :)
In Croatia we have tambura/tamburitza and some other old primitive traditional instruments like bagpipes and more primitive tamburas - [example for all of it] Tambura bands have 5-8 members but there are also orchestras and folklore organizations who take care of preserving and promoting this kind of music and art
Vinkovci: the Habsburgs built us a Gymnasium in the 18th century, now it's the most elite school in our area
Harboring hungarian king Bela IV during Mongolian invasions and obtaining Golden Bull for it, establishing it as a Free royal city in 1242
With the bull the city was exempt from standard feudal practices and prospered as small center of merchants and craftsmen

(Hopefully, I to wrote the Hungarian name correctly)
No, Samobor
A few other cities were granted Golden Bulls at the time aswell
That was uncalled for

I know
But we're turning into a prejudiced society acting like that
Croatian has many similiar to Polish
• let - flight
• to - that
• car - tsar
• do - to
• on - he
• brat - brother
• list - leaf
• a - but
• gore - up/mountains
• more - sea
• rat - war
• roman - novel
• kite - dicks
• sir - cheese

sat - clock, watch;
rub - edge, brim;
pet - five;
van - towards outside;
sag - rug;
pat - stalemate;

Not many Europeans know exactly how to act in every other part of Europe
It's not a problem
You just observe how local people act and try to fit in, or at least not annoy people
khem, English people, khem
I know, I live in the UK
The reason why you do not bother to try though is this English exceptionalism and the fact that you have never got off your high imperialist horse
You lot always blame it on alcohol whenever I try and speak to you about it, but in reality its the arrogance and thinking that you are better than the continent
Ask any Croatian during the tourist season
Half three like 2:30
Because we say it like that in croatia as well
What else could it be
What
It is literally one of the most common arguments between dalmatians (2 ipo) and northerners (pola 3)
Also tri manje kvarat vs petanest do tri (3 minus quarter vs fifteen until 3)
I have been late a couple of times because my brain interprets "pola 3" as just "half + three". Also the whole "frtalj" thing which I still don't really get
Yep, I usually skip breakfast or eat something from a bakery around 10 or 11
Lunch is the largest and most important meal of the day while dinner is just leftovers/a sandwich/salad/pancakes/eggs etc
Unless it is a special occasion, like eating at a real restaurant for some reason, weddings, birthdays, Christmas eve etc
While most people don't skip breakfast, the rest is the norm in the Balkans at least AFAIK
that's right
we have "3 i po" (3 and a half, "po" shortened from pola, meaning half) and pola 3 meaning half 3
one is 3:30, the other is 2:30
Oh, I even heard that countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are communist
To me that sounds like it's trying to say that it's a stark contrast to be black in Sweden as Swedes are amongst the palest people on the planet
I start with socialist bailouts
Turns peaceful people into a raging inferno
They adore their rich corporations and money-hoarding psychopaths
What
I have never paid to take a piss here in my life
What kind of places were you at
Just go into the nearest coffee shop (disclaimer: you cant be more than 500 meters from one) and politely ask to use the toilet
I can buy 30-35 square meter apartment, hopefully there will be some leftover for taxes, stamps and fees
North-East Munich, Germany
Prices are normally 8-10000K euros per square meter
No wonder it was declared as a biggest property bubble in the world
In my hometown (Zagreb, Croatia) I could buy 3 cozy apartments, or two houses, or 2 normal apartments + 1 cozy house
Took a look and i found for 368k i can buy a mansion with pool and wellnes that is  396 square meters
With that kind of money you can buy a 300-400 m2 house or at least 2 flats (80-100 m2)in 99% of locations in my town and surrounding area (urbanized centre and countryside with cca 200k people) with enough leftover money for a nice car
You might get some modern newly built mansions at the sea side with pool and other ammenities
That is serious level money there
And for most of the country (excluding strict centre of capital or posh touristy/historic locations) it gets you at least that and probably more
In many rural parts you can get a house with sizeable lot of arable land for less than 50-100k €.
What bezirk is that
I have a cousin in 9th and an uncle in 19th, the latter one looks pretty cool for living
I was browsing immoscout few days ago for an apartment in my area/street and all I found was 670,000-700,000 euros for 62-67 sqm, wtf
Wait, those huge buildings next to the river
I was there in 2019 and the neighbourhood was still being built but it looked pretty good and fancy
No, no, give me your address so i can come and visit you the next weekend
He was an architect, now retired so yeah, he's living the life
I really love vienna, it would totally be a city i could live in if it was closer to the sea

He just holds the latest patent, first records show it was  [Leonardo da Vinci] and after that second was Faust Vrancic (Fausto Veranzio) from Sibenik, then Venetian republic

Pros: beautiful nature and architecture, safe, low crime rate, food, clean water, free education and healthcare
Cons: very high corruption rate and low wages both of which led to brain drain, conservative, overly complicated administration, slow and unreliable public transport (especially trains)
I love two Serbian patriotic songs from World War 1, despite the fact that Croats fought on the opposing Habsburg side
[Marš na Drinu, (March on Drina)] - Very inspiring, the lyrics are especially sharp and fun, really motivates you to go and fight for your fatherland
It was created in commemoration of the 1914 battle of Cer, where the Serbian army beat Austria-Hungary
[Tamo Daleko, (Far, far away)] - Very emotional, detailing the nostalgia for their occupied fatherland of the Serbian army-in-exile on Corfu
I like how they're patriotic without explicitly attacking or diminishing the enemy
They're the complete opposite of the most popular type of war songs from the 90s where the enemy was brutally humiliated in songs, on a ridiculous level
What was your people's most famous disaster (as in earthquakes, explosions, nuclear leaks)
For Croatia(these hit Serbia and Bosnia more) the 2014 floods were ravaging for the southern Slavonia region which was completely flooded
Villages and towns were destroyed along with people, livestock and other living things whom died in the catastrophe
Apparently a few people killed themselves in despair for their homes and loved ones
Other disaster is the Dubrovnik earthquake in the  16th century maybe, which as earthquakes do destroyed a bunch of stuff and killed some people
this is a link to the most serious disasters in Croatia by death toll if someone wants to read
They are not natural but still interesting
Currently Zagreb is still recovering from an earthquake and a flood which came last week I think
The old town is in desperate condition and "thankfully" "only" one person died
Oh yeah, I saw that
Since you are our neighbours
How many people did get hurt
I meant a disaster that was directly related to your people
Doesn't have to happen in your country
you forgot to mention a draft
It's the biggest killer and  an enemy of all balkanites that have ever lived
let's not forget wet hair even if it's 30 degrees outside
nah, if anything it's universal I'd dare to say across europe
I wouldn't wonder if someone on Canary islands also won't come out on 35 degrees temp

We have similar for a face but without a wind
If you close your brows like you are angry or have sun in your eyes you will be stuck with that expression/face
you asked for it, baba milka was internet star
Folders
We just had notebooks
I'd either get something that went with the theme of the subject or whatever else I thought looked cute
For Croatia it would be the easternmost region, Slavonia
Its people are known by their extreme hospitality, great food and hardwork
Since it is kinda poorer than the rest of the coutry it also gets a lot of simpathy and empathy by the rest of the country
What about Bremen
I've heard a lot of germans hating on bavaria, saying they're religious nuts and hillbillies
I even heard the comparison that bavaria is germany's texas
Was wondering when i'll find one croat here because i dont think we have a town/city/region everyone likes
Regarding slavonia, i'm not sure about the rest of croatia but istrians arent big fans od them
There's a bunch of them who came to pula, looking for a better life i guess, and people dont like their backwards mentality usually
They're pretty
how should i put it
simple, traditional and primitive
I mean if i'd have to make a list of regions and people slavonia would be somewhere near the bottom
Girls probably
I've never been there but people say that girls from Novi Sad are something else
And i think there's more of them than men, a lot more but i'm not sure if that's correct
Can you give me some reasons
I'll be moving to Bremen in a few days and would greatly benefit from this information
Thanks, I will be in Walle and I've already been warned of that place hahaha
English all the way
Helped by the fact I'm working with people from all over the globe, so, um, yeah, it would be kinda hard for them to understand what the writer wanted to convey if everything was in Croatian
It’s considered budget with mediocre quality
People shop there but mostly buy brand names and local products
Not a lot of their products except for snacks which are very good imo
There is an insult sort of common in middle school where bullies call poor pupils “Lidlić” (meaning little Lidl) for wearing clothes from Lidl
I dislike going there because I never seem to find what I’m looking for
A basic food like cooking cream
I looked for that fucker for 10 minutes and still couldn’t find it, said fuck it and went to an another supermarket
Here in Croatia its one of the better ones
I always put Lidl, Aldi and Norma in the same group because they offer similar products and have similar prices
The other one would consist of Netto and Penny and then you have Edeka, Rewe, Hit, Kaufland, V-Markt and Real with best offer
This goes for Bavaria, I don't know what other shops are popular in other parts of Germany
Sretan rodendan(kinda),(If you understood what I said)
I guess they're just regional
Many products in Lidl and Aldi are basically the same (they just have different names) and so are the prices
All in all, it's very similar
Depends on who
If it’s a friend, you just say “Halo” (Hello) If it’s someone from a professional environment you say “Dobar dan” (Good day) If it’s a stranger, you say “Dobar dan, tko ste vi
” (Good day, who are you
"Halo"
"Dobar dan
Or: "Jebemu boga, po sedamdeseti put danas, baba, ovo NIJE stan Ivančić, ja NE ZNAM gospodina Ivančića ni njegovu ženu, doviđenja"
While "slušam" has the same meaning in Croatian, if you use it when answering the phone the meaning would be more like "ok, what did you mess/fuck up now
" :)
Gotta admit, it kinda does
Like, after da I'd half expect "koj kurac hoces
" XD
I also just go with halo
Croats arrived to the Balkans in the 7th century, but it is unknown when it was founded
The first Croatian dukes start appearing in the 9th century
There were some earlier rulers who might have had the title
Croatia became a kingdom in the 10th century and the crown switched between different dynasties with varying degrees of autonomy
Croatian republic was established inside Socialist Yugoslavia during WW2 and it became independent in 1991
Constantine VII wrote in his De Administrando Imperio that we came to today’s Croatia around 626
During a rule of Duke Branimir, on 7th June 879, Duchy of Croatia was officially recognized as a state by Pope John VIII
Kingdom was established in 925 by our first king Tomislav
Well we arrived here and established 2 duchies in 7th century but after 1102 we had a shit ton of foreign leaders up until 25 June 1991 when we became independent
925 was the year when the first kingdom of Croatia appeared with the crowning of the king Tomislav
We are not sure if Tomislav was ever crowned as king, but he was for sure recognised as one
I've already seen it, but thank you
It is fine for a short summary
Probably because unlike Croatia or Slovakia it mostly wasn't part of any Hungarian state
Only the northeastern Prekmurje region, I believe, and that's really small
In Croatia, there’s always a friend in some rural town with a tractor willing to help you out
Other than that, you use a car to awkwardly move it
i was in a similar situation few weeks back when i needed to transport two 2
5 metres tables to my workshop
often there's someone you know who has a van which helps when you need to bring shit from ikea but this time the tables were too big for that van so i rented one
there's an option for 2 hours rental (or 4
) for 200 kn, which is like 25 eur so i did just that
i don't know man, drywall isn't that reliable as well
i hanged more than few paintings with just a nail in a brick wall and if a painting is too heavy for that chances are it will be too heavy for the drywall as well so you'll have to use your dubel on both
Well, most houses are built with reinforced concrete in various parts of the house for structural safety as a measure against earthquakes, and well we don't have tornadoes or hurricanes and etc
i was always wondering why people in tornado alley don't build stronger houses
i mean, it's called "tornado alley" ffs, you know it's gonna hit
so why not just use reinforced concrete then and be done with it
sure, you'll probably need to patch the roof and few windows but the house would be standing, right
there must be a better way other than building your house from scratch after every season
but i'm guessing the tornados which completely destroy houses aren't that common otherwise people wouldn't live there
sure it's cheaper if you compare the prices, but what if you put in the account all the stuff that's in the house and also the psychological toll a destroyed house brings with it, homelessness and shit
i don't know man, i'd rather pay more for a sturdy house so i don't have to worry about it
Daj kako se to zove na nasem
Guglao sam sta je, za pocetak, al sad se ne mogu sjetit kako mi to zovemo
Ja to nikad nisam ni vidio ni radio na tome
Hmm, nije strug, ja mislim na nesto drugo
For the people who are against it, how do you feel about famous athletes getting the citizenship
We had few examples in croatia because our government is so happy when they need to give our citizenship to people like eduardo da silva and sammir (both brazilians, both played football for our NT and both speak very broken croatian)
I dont know, it doesnt bother me tbh, there can be a bunch of reasons why someone would want a citizenship like political prosecution or war, in cases like that i wouldnt mind if they cant speak the language yet, they'll learn it
They don't demand Spanish citizenship though
They're EU citizens living in the EU (for now hehe)
Me too
I'm not an art student but I thought I'd chip in as a computing one since we got a similar thing about creating software
In my university (in Scotland undergrad) the code/programs we write belong to the student not the university, although we don't really need to pay for supplies the university does supply us with some of the fancier pay for programs
I know a lot of people do pay for graphics here and there for their programs, such as when we had a game module, but at the end we retain rights of our code and art assets aren't graded so I don't see a huge issue about it
A lot of people plan to publish their nicer code or working on it after our courses and make something of it so it's really cool
Edit: some minor issues, formatting
Yeah undergrad sorry for not specifying
We always greet each other and sometimes chat for a bit, it really depends on individual people's personalities
Some people will chat you up every time they see you, it's also not uncommon for neighbors to befriend each other and hang out in front of the building almost every day, sometimes they eat and drink too (though that's mostly men, women will sometimes join in or just invite each other over for coffee)
15 minutes walk, 10 minutes tram ride
I work in a larger city but live 40km away in a smaller one - it takes me about 25 minutes by car
It can take much longer during summer though since we have a lot of tourists here
I do have the option of going by bus but it takes way longer (45 minutes between cities and then catching the local bus to the other side of the city - I'm guessing it would take me about 90 minutes, if not even longer)
i like how scandinavian names sound
Stuff like Milorad and stojadin
That's foreign right
> I went as far away as possible as soon as I could
Flair checks out
Either way, welcome to Europe :)
In 1660s Croatian’ soldiers (mercs) went to fight for France
When they arrived in Paris in their full uniform, French fell in love
"In 1660 a regiment of Croats arrived in France — a part of their singular costume excited the greatest admiration, and was immediately and generally imitated; this was a tour de cou , made (for the private soldiers) of common lace, and of muslin or silk for the officers ; the ends were arranged en rosette , or ornamented with a button or tuft, which hung gracefully on the breast
This new arrangement, which confined the throat but very slightly, was at first termed a Croat, since corrupted to Cravat
[A tie
It's kinda ironic, everything that you consider bad is at leat 10 times worse in Balkan's, so even these thing that are bad to you, seem like utopia for us, just yesterday I talked with a friend how our bureaucreacy is slow compared to German, and also recently there was a talk how in Germany you can start in low wage job, but if you show that you can work and are willing to work you can easily get a raise or even go upwards in jobs, while here where you start, you'll most likely stay, and only chance of your minimal wage rising is if goverment increases minimal wage, something which happens rarely and only in very small incremental values
It's almost as if they are a problem in Europe
Sure my reddit kid, because I totally proposed the same solution
We literally had that queston in our version of The Chase (tv quiz) yesterday
Something like, if you're watching Croatian national tv on New Year's day, first you'll be in Vienna and later
and the answer was Garmisch
I personally didn't watch it today but I love the tradition
That everyone wanted to be a footballer and is good at it
We have it in Croatia and we recycle up to 95% of all bottles because of it
A lot of homeless/poor people make a living out of collection bottles on the street
Happened to me last week when I went to a job interview in Hamburg
The Germans were pretty surprised the only thing we mix is "gemischt" and that sparkling water with apple juice is actually pretty bad
What
That's inhumane
Yes, we have Christmas beer, but mulled wine is far more popular in the festive season
Pretty Common in villages and smaller towns in Croatia
Yes, it is
I don't cut my wood but my relatives do it for me and money
Why poor
Some people just want to save some money ;-)
We learned mostly about how some noble Croatians (mostly ban Jelacic) fought and won the Hungarian uprising and then a bit how the German language was pushed onto us while a couple of politicians fought for Croatian language
It was a long time ago but i'd say it was mostly neutral
I liked Austro Hungarian empire myself, i think it was pretty cool
Correct me if i'm wrong but serbia was never an empire, you were a kingdom, right
For a few years they really were an empire (a decade or so)
The lands they ruled reached from Serbia (no Vojvodina then) to southwards
Croatia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, parts of Greece - Thrace, Attica, Peloponese and Agean weren't under their control
So roughly, they controlled half of Balkans at the time
Fucking ottomans
Ruining plans since 1300s.
Toyko, Nagasaki, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Sapporo, Niigata, Fukuoka, Saga, Mutsu, Sendai, Kobe, Kure, Yokosuka, Kochi, Yura, Kaga, Katori, Kashima, Ise, Kirishima, Sasebo (Happy 130 years
) and Onomichi
The first third is common knowledge, all other is thanks to KanColle and various naval research and events
I could name more rivers and peaks than cities though heh
edit - Also small islands
Onomichi is a city I remember from Kamichu
Looks like an interesting city with it being half on an island
I can't say I've seen many documentaries \*presented\* here, they are mostly \*narrated\*. The most well-known documentary narrators here are Drago Celizić and Miljenko Kokot
However, the household name for documentaries in Croatia is Đelo Hadžiselimović. Whenever you see or hear "Odabrao: Đelo Hadžiselimović", you know that is (going to be) a good show
Knowing of [Oliver Mlakar] in Croatia is a question of basic general knowledge
Don't forget how Bandić handled the terrible earthquake that struck Zagreb this march
He spent a large part of the funds previously reserved for disasters into funding churches in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Because he lacked money for repairs, he took away Easter holiday salaries from city-owned companies and kindergardens and transfered them to the disaster fund without informing them
Most of the taken money was used for repairing buildings of his loyalists and administration
And even if he actually bought repairs for the city, the spending was very mismanaged and insufficient for many people
We have that
But its just called "tost" (toast)
Well, as of now, we became the top destinations for earthquakes
Recently we had a third big one this year
Again and again, Ante Pavelić.
Ante Pavelić , fascist leader of the independent state of Croatia ,lead the Ustaše
Pretty much all teachers in the country are striking
Starting today every school is on strike and canceled untill the goverment raises the teachers' salaries
There is one every two weeks, hard to keep track of them all
Debt to IMF
Ethno nationalism
Ex-Yu music is great
Especially Odbrana i Poslednji dana by Idoli (Defense and Last Days)
But what the fuck happened with modern music
Those things basically promote drug abuse
hoho, Mlinar in Zagreb is making burek with orange and its fucking amazing
Spot on
What about massive percentage of kids smoking at age 14 and drinking at 12
Best part of our culture
Men
Women, children, local stray cats and dogs, a confused tourist, everyone
I don't eat bread
But my grandma wants me to eat too much food, that's true
When she sees an empty plate, she asks me 3 times do I want more
In what way have you experienced Balkan hospitality if I may ask
Considering the wars that have made this area quite popular, I am also quite scared of army drafts as well lol
Is slovenian really the least similar
I think i'd communicate easier with a slovenian than a macedonian but it also varies from region to region
I think that a croatian from zagorje would have less problems understanding you than a croatian from dubrovnik, lets say
Oh, so that means that alexander the great was a slav too
Neat
Aleksa Veliki
Oh, let me tell you, Slovenia is pretty big in both the inferiority and superiority complex
It's still the best one of us though
Who dislikes turks
It's not 19th century anymore and, if anything, i'm really grateful for kebabs
I've never heard someone hating turks over here
It's surprising we don't like Turks with the amount of Turkish tv shows we have
Lol, wtf, who likes guns and weapons
I feel like it's mainly serbian criminal culture, it goes hand in hand with serbian turbo folk
German cars as well
I feel like you're describing the most primitive people, creme de la creme of every turbo folk club in the region
Normal people are not like that nor do the listen to turbo folk
If we want to provoke/tease Bosnians, we start talking about burek with apples/cherries :) Coup de grace is "burek with potatoes". :P
Disagree
Can confirm
People think I am not normal if I don't eat bread
I've never met anyone in my life who eats bread with pasta
It's just wrong to do that
Horrible
I eat bread with something i can dip it in (goulash, sarma, punjene paprike) and thats it
Eastern European countries are much much much older than the US
In fact, one of the first countries in the world to officially recognise the independence of America was a then city-state of Dubrovnik
Kajkavian dialect in Croatia is a nightmare to understand for me as someone from dalmatia
Language is just a dialect with an army
The same can be said for scandinavian countries, they also all understand each other
At least we have a different alphabet, if nothing else
Čoko burek masterrace
Lol, so you're calling cabbage "zelje" as well
I got really confused when i came to zagreb to study, i ordered "zelje" salad thinking i'd get the green salad but got cabbage instead
Oof
That's an interesting story
Ceca has her own problems
Even Arkan didn't hate Croats as much (some sources even saying he helped Croats in the war), despite the Maksimir stadium riot in 1990
But that is an another story
Now, pushing crappy music is never a good idea
Most of Serbian scene are males looking like the biggest hillbillies seen, or females that have so much silicones and botox in themselves and sing crappy songs
Unfortunately, such music has changed our society (of all the ex-Yu states) for the worse
It evolved to something even worse
While turbofolk is hillbilly music, it is step above this modern whatever things
No talents, vocals more annoying than a fly or mosquito, drug promotive songs etc
Croatian music may be old-fashioned
But it atleast is music, not whatever this is today
Unfortunately, night clubs are also pushing cajke even here in Croatia
And it sucks
I can give some respect to Mile Kitić, but not to Relja Popović or Rasta for example
I think it only got more popular during socialism tbh
You betray your kind
Well, obviously
I'm talking about standard slovenian vs standard macedonian
Hell, i don't understand a lot when i'm talking to croats from zagorje or even dalmatia
While i'm guessing people from slavonija or even zagreb wouldnt understand a word of proper istrian dialect
i'm talking about croatia, not serbia
sure, there's a bunch of illegal war leftovers but i'm talking about regular citizens, not criminals or ptsd veterans
i see a lot of things wrong with gun culture, i don't like it and i prefer not to turn into another usa where every other guy has a gun around his waist
Oof
Burek with kulen isn't that bad of a idea
>Even Arkan didn't hate Croats as much (some sources even saying he helped Croats in the war)
Dude he was the leader of a death squad paramilitary group that massacred their way through Croatia and Bosnia
Do you eat bread with pasta
Careful what you answer because i've acquired a particular set of skills that make me a nightmare for people who eat bread with pasta
bread goes with a sandwich
I have pasta for that and no, yuck, wtf
Pasta is there instead of the bread
I actually found Istrian čakavian to be more similar to kajkavian than I expected, so I'd probably kinda manage if I know kajkavian
Maybe I do, maybe I don't. What disturbs me is you only eating bread with something you can dip it in
I can't imagine not eating bread with most things
It is essential
Most of my family freaks out without bread
I found that out too, especially when you hear words like tega/toga, and gremo/idemo
Really
I'm not sure that's true since we have a lot of italian words while in zagorje they have german
There's a word or two that's the same but i'm pretty sure that 2 guys, one speaking only istrian while the other speaking kajkavian from zagorje wouldnt understand each other at all
yes, the guy i replied to said
>We all really like that 'badass' culture, guns, weapons, etc
which simply isnt correct
i even said that it's mainly serbian criminal culture connected with turbofolk, it's not the same situation here
it's the same like every slovenian in this thread saying "not us".
i dislike any gun culture, i don't think civilians should own firearms without a proper reason, especially not carry them around
our countries are not unsafe, i really don't think anyone needs a gun in this day and age in croatia
unless you're a hunter or whatever
I wouldn't have such an optimistic view
There were at least two entire generations of people born and raised in friendship in Yugoslavia, and they were much closer to each other than we all are today
Yet still, the countries and the peoples went to war, and did terrible things to each other
That ephemeral friendship between individuals is nothing against mobilizied collective enmity and hatred
Trusting it's power is a mistake
A mistake which all our parents made as well
Its not essential lol
If i had to guess i'd say continental croatia, right
People dont eat that much bread in istria, especially the younger generations
From my experiences very few younger people eat bread in zagreb as well, its just not good for you
It's essential in my household
Also, not continental Croatia, Northern Adriatic here
it's ok, we can all have different opinions on the matter
Just dont tell me you're istrian because everything i believe in will fall apart
I thought people from adriatic (especially northern where there's more italian influence) know about their pasta and respect the sanctity of it
You can rest easy knowing I'm not Istrian
I live on an island and there is nothing better than some bread with your spaghetti
White bread with ragu
Your loss
Everything being written in Cyrillic in rural central Croatia (Kordun)
It's an area populated by Serbs but I didn't expect they actually used Cyrillic here that much
Here in coastal Croatia we say time the same way your Primorci do but in continental Croatia the same as continental Slovenia/Germany
Maybe it's because of the Adriatic :P
Was or still is
200 złoty
Ehh I think to maintain your Protestantism in a >80% Catholic country you probably have to be really hardcore in your beliefs
And I think Catholicism is generally more down with alcohol and holiday celebrations
Wow that's cheaper than a lot of places in Croatia
I don't hate Serbs
...THAT much
Don't we all hate politics
yea, go ride your bike around windmills or whatever you Dutch do
keep out of Balkan business
Puši kao Turčin - to smoke like a Turk, just means someone smokes alot
Arne Matteson's *One summer of happiness* was first movie shown in cinema with nudity
He even twenty years filmed an erotic movie [Ann and Eve] here
> An erotic drama about a youthful bride-to-be who takes a holiday to Yugoslavia with a cynical and evil lesbian film critic (and murderess) that leads to debauchery, degradation with a dwarf, a dinner with naked entertainers and other highlights
Erotic movies were quite popular at the time Danish [Hopa cupa u krevetu] was the most watched movie of 1977 in the country and Emanuelle series also had a big following
Blackface is not controversial topic at all, and it's commonly seen in carnival season and in nativity plays (Caspar)
People are unaware of anglophone context where it's seen as something obviously racist, no matter if there is malicious intent or not
My wife and I used to go to a spa with saunas where most people wore just towels and some were naked
Recently we went to Slovenia and it was quite the opposite, almost all people were naked
One thing was common, though
No swimsuits were allowed
I had to google it honestly which one was which and the result said that at first three kings represented old, middle-aged and young "magi" but in time they became kings and *Melkior* represented Europe, *Gašpar* represented Africa while *Baltazar* represented Asia
Ugh my relatives would get water guns out and spray us that way
I absolutely hated it
We burn a bloke called Fasnik
Aparently, most Slavs and some Baltic people have a similar tradition
Same in Croatia
Wtf
Pack your shit up guys, we have a winner
None of these are really internationally famous but
Josip Jelačić, ban of Croatia in the mid-19th century
He's considered a national hero, has a huge monument on the main square of Zagreb, his face is on the 20 kuna bill etc
etc
He's famous for fighting against Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848
A common trope in Croatian historiography is that Hungarians were vehemently anti-Croatian in their nationalism and that Jelačić defended our existence
This is
an exaggeration at best, and Jelačić was just a reactionary monarchist who also helped crush the revolutionary movement in Vienna and install the neo-absolutist government later on
Funny thing is that during the 19th century even Croatian nationalists hated his guts for being such a monarchist suck-up but that all changed with time
Other people would include our first president Franjo Tuđman and the leader of the interwar Croatian Peasant Party (in the 1930s at least) - Vlatko Maček
Ugh, he was VERY cruel and disgusting
Really ?
I think everyone hates the guy
What he has done
One problem I  have with Maček is his inactivity during WW2 ,but why do you think he was so bad  in the interwar period
On that list I might put Ante Starčević. Although influential in developing Croatian national identity,  his writing can come of as really primitive and xenophobic
Oh, he's the guy that operated in Rijeka, right
We had some italian nationalists couple of days ago who pulled out a flag of kingdom of italy (or something like that) infront of D'Annunzios house in Rijeka
Also, you built his monument in Trieste and our government isnt too happy about it
How is he seen in modern Ukraine ?
All embrace me, It’s my time to rule at last
Well, he gave in to anti-semitic policies of the late 1930s royal government and supported its authoritarian turn - best seen in the formation of concentration camps for communists and communist sympathizers in 1939, which were then simply handed over to the Ustaše in 1941 with most inmates still inside (for instance Kerestinec)
Also yeah, the passivity
It's not just simple passivity though, HSS just turned its coat and gave its massive party apparatus over to the Ustaše, together with the bureaucracy of the Croatian Banovina
The Croatian Peasant and Citizen Guard - a HSS paramilitary organization - formed the backbone of Ustaša rule in the first few weeks after the occupation
Maček was fine with that, he just didn't want to give official party support to the Ustaše, probably hoping that at some point the old regime would come back
I agree on Starčević, though I think he was a more interesting and nuanced figure than people think today
Lol, you think so
Dude, my government is giving importance to everything that can maybe shift the focus from the actual problems
It happens all the time
Ok, the statue is retarded, especially if he's a fascist but i've never heard of him before a couple of days ago and i dont care about a couple of italian idiots trying to stir some shit up
And its not like we dont have a history with idiotic monuments ourselves
It's dark in my room ,dude !
I think Ottomans impaled people vertically while Vlad did it transversally
I understood that reference
I am sorry, Mr
Lebowski
I read it somewhere ,but not being sure I wrote
>I think
I'd say it's the '40s and ustasa regime
There were stories about the ss officers visiting croatia and writing back home how cruel ustasas are
You gotta stop and think about shit you're doing if even the germans were appalled by your actions
Hungary monarch came to the Croatian throne, about 11th century, we haven't had a sovereign country since then
Well
Hmmmm
that's the one you pick
Really
Id say first Yugoslavia was more stupid, like Stjepan Radić said "You are rushing like geese into a fog". First Yugoslavia ended up being really oppressive towards Croats, which led to dissent and rise of Ustasha regime, if we stayed out of Yugoslavia, Ustasha regime wouldn't get backed by so much people like it did, you have to understand at start that regime looked like freedom to many Croats because how oppressive first Yugoslavia was
Dude
Really
It's like germany saying the dumbest thing is joining in with the austro hungary on the war because if it werent for world war 1 hitler would never rose to power
The dumbest thing croatians did was settle here in the 7th century because we should have fucking gone somewhere away from balkans
Tbh i'd pick the gavrilo princip thingy but then again, i have no idea what happened with bulgaria
Should have stayed with our Czech brothers and sisters =(
At least they often visit
We'll consider it if you return trieste to slovenia
Yeah, maybe
Never mind, carry on
Not most beautiful one, far from it, but [Bosnia and Herzegovina plates] have practical reason behind it
The letters and numbers are all random for the fact that there are still unsettled issues after the war in the 90s where the country was torn apart between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats
In order to prevent people destroying or damaging other people's cars, they removed any canton/regional association from the plates
&#x200B;
On the other hand, I really love old German, Austrian and Swiss plates, with each region having their coat of arms on it
I'm Croat, the national emblem is ugly
just a checker board or red and white checkered fields would be nice
The whole flag is ugly but it is also revered
They do seem practical and I love the fact that the plates are bound to the car for its lifetime, but other than being practical, I see no real difference or usefulness between Irish plates and some totally random numbers/letters
The information on the plates is irrelevant, and especially since Irish plates can be transferred from Wexford to Galway, they don't tell much about the car/driver either
In Bosnia for example, the plates are made random on purpose, because some cantons over there are basically *in war* and having clear identifier visible on your car could lead to some bad situations
Sincere apologies Slovenac :)
I didn't think of your plates at all :(
I would say Rijeka since the other cities on the coast suffered from the lack of tourists and Rijeka isn't really a tourist city
Other cities inland also nothing special and I can't put Zagreb since the earthquake damage still exists
Rijeka was the European capital of culture for 2020 and because of that and the EU the whole town is renovating
A new square is also in the process of building
Osijek is also a city I would like to put because near it ,a new highway is in the making,a new stadium is going to be built and a new campus for students is also there
Trst za siromašne
I only see them on the edges of towns and forests
Same
Same thing for me
I feel like the geek culture is not that popular in Croatia
You serious
Before coronavirus struck my group had 3 D&D games ongoing
Absolutely packed to max
We were playing one or two/week
We're in Zagreb though
As far as I know, dnd and other geeky tabletop games are barely popular here
I know a handful of people who know them
It is true that national TV broadcasts Star Trek reruns and the fact that we had some really good magazines, but I don't think they are popular outside the biggest cities
I'm serious for the rest of Croatia
I also know some people who played or still play in various groups in Krapina, Varaždin, Kutina, Osijek, Rijeka, Opatija, Pazin, Umag, Zadar and Split
Though, granted, Zagreb is probably the largest center of geekdom in the country
Rijeka is not far behind though
I would agree with you
I am attending a technical school in Osijek so 90% of the time I am surrounded by people who want to be "like everybody else" and are not that interested in geeky things
I think officially there is no line in regular letters
In cursive, Z looks like backward 3 anyway so the line is not there anyway
Personally, i put it on the capital version and not on the lowercase
We have them but they are really, really rare
Tipping
Tbh peanutbutter and jelly is a fucking amazing combo
I would never have thought it would be that good
I guess people like seeing the stereotypes surrounding them and what other people think of them, I can't blame them tbh, I like seeing stereotypes and shit about my country
Well yeah but there you must tip
If I dont like your service and think you were rude, I sure as hell am not giving you shit let alone 15-20%.
I drink coffee everyday in a coffee shop and I pay 8 kuna for it, so 7 of us pay 56kn together, but obviously round it up to 60kn
To my understanding if I were in the US and tried to pay by card, the machine would give me options for a 10%-15%+ tip like I must do it
That would all be above 60kn and would round up to a weird number
That's what I dont understand
I've heard this before, but I can't believe it, the tips are already in the price
Isn't that like, breaking the law or something
Seems ridicoulus
Test the soup and send them to jail lol
If someone spitted in my soup I couldn't have given less of a fuck tbh
Not really in the whole country
All the infrastructure was built during the communist era, so most buildings are just big cubes with people
Other than that, we have great really old architecture, but almost nothing modern
Well, that depends
Does everyone suddenly get reasonable over nationalism and sovereignty
And by that I obviously mean come closer to what I think is reasonable
Then all the way
Make us a federal state like the US
However, if everyone doesn't suddenly get reasonable about these very, very emotionally charged topics, then it's a very difficult question
I would integrate further in some areas, but not all
For now I'd focus on unifying our foreign relations and defence, hopefully completely
Next up would be a harmonization of taxes and economic regulation to ease the inequalities between richer and poorer states
Next up, reduce the Council's power, and make it simply an upper house of the EU parliament, akin to the US system with Representatives (allocated broadly by population size) and Senators (allocated equally among all states)
That might prove overly ambitious though
Croatian Disney Princess is the daughter of a war veteran (likely a fake one) turned politician, has access to everything for free, her companion is a marten, and her magical power is making the tax payers' money disappear
We do as part of WW2
Not in detail, more like a general synopsis
Zagreb Cathedral (the tallest building)
Museum Mimara
Croatian national thetre (HNK)
Ban Jelačić statue (gotta assert Zagreb dominance)
**Ancient**
[The Pula arena] - one of the best preserved roman amphitheatres in the world, still used today (WC 2018, Croatia-England match)
[Palace of the roman emperor Diocletian AD 305 in Split]
[And today]
**Gothic, Renaissance**
[Šibenik cathedral] - very unusual mix of gothic and Renaissance styles, incredible structural solutions for its dome and vaults
**Vienna secession**
[Old National and university library in Zagreb, now State Archives]
**Contemporary**
[Sea Organ & The Greetings To The Sun in Zadar ]
Police, tram conducters, TV licence incasators, journalists, bankers, judges and lawyers
That's insanely expensive
I mean, we pay 80kn (cca 10gbp) and still hate it
Here's a reason, at least for Croatia:
A lot of corrupt people (Politicians, sport officials, CEOs) from Croatia have dual citizenship with Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of them, and even when sentencing happens they are allowed to go to Bosnia and carry out their sentence there, but what actually happens is that their courts have to confirm that sentence, which they normally lower and in a lot of cases even overturn, because their country is even more corrupt, so they stay there, on a sort of vacation, and once thing goes old in legal terms, they come back and carry on doing business as usual
The most recent case is Zdravko Mamic, it's even become a meme now that whenever there is some laege sentencing against someone (happens every few weeks) we joke how there might be some traffic jams on Bosnian border

Whenever I see those "France always surrenders jokes" or "America/oil jokes" I instantly picture you as a fucking idiot
I'm gonna be a bit different here
I like joking and seeing jokes on Americans
I don't like any country being criticized except USA xd
Sorry bald eagles
But there's just so much about you
Ayy thanks mate
Even tho sometimes there are incredible deep dicsussions or argues online between Croatians and Serbs
On social media I mean
I never do that ofc
To whoever insults our Czech bros: be careful, we know places where not even Croatian Mountain Service can find you :)
" Yeah maybe invading half the planet while portraying yourself as the valiant bastion of freedom does that to you
&#x200B;
I don't understand how precisely the first thing cancels out the second one, however almost every time US has invaded a country they've been liberated from a certain totalitarian regime
"but American oil jokes are surprisingly accurate, "
Incredibly inaccurate, actually
America has been importing oil mostly from Canada/Saudi Arabia before becoming self dependent
Wars in Iraq and Syria weren't about the American oil, for example Iraqi war, 2/3 trillion were spent on it, US could've increased it's oil production for 1/5th of that price
Also, Solar/Wind Energy would be a good thing to develop, considering America has one of the best renewable energy sources potential, unlike the rest of the Western world
I was an enormous baby, my mom barely gave birth to me
So the doctor called me Tiki - which was the name of the water heater - smaller boiler  but the shape is still there
They kept it thru my childhood
My sister’s nickname was Vrtirepka, thats the words play of ‘spinning tail’ cause she was always jumping around, running, spinning and early twerking :D
Funny thing is that both my sis and I have a 3 letters name so we don’t actually need no nicknames
My dad calls me "bebo" (kinda like "little baby") and žabo (frog)
I didn't have one
There were only my parents and I, we all just called each other "you" and "him/her".
The whole world is slowly going towards legalizing weed but you guys want to go in the opposite direction and ban everything that's bad for you
What the fuck
If grown ass people wanna smoke let them fucking smoke, who are you to tell them if they can or can't do it
Well, how else would they practice their lying and stealing skills
There is a reason why the foreskin exists it isn't useless
You two should move to saudi arabia, you'll like it there
Just look at the fucking prohibition and all the gangsters that rose to power because they could smuggle alcohol
I said grown ass men, not kids
Again, if you wanna go down that path then you should ban everything that's bad for you, starting with obesity
So no sodas, no greasy food, no salt, etc
We'll be all eating that stuff from matrix that tastes like chicken
Because that's exactly what i said
Following your logic, do you think that water and food should be criminalized
You really think you'll get affected by a short wiff of someone's cigarette
While breathing the fucking smog from cars the whole day
Come on, chill the fuck down
What are you going on about for fucks sake
Hopefully none
But you equating cigarettes with heroin is the same as equating them with water, fucking ridiculous
Decriminalize marijuana
Better criminalize everything else
Drinking beer-12 years in max security prison, smoking a cigarette-life sentence without the possibility of parole
In Zagreb's lake Jarun there is something like a Loch Ness, it is called " catfish Jura" which is a 300kg heavy catfish
As I understood it, the legend came to be because a lot of people would drown in the lake
Also, Baba Roga was a thing, which was used to scare children
It is a witch with a big nose and horns
Then this [dude] who turned into a vampire
And [The Black Queen] from Plitivce Lakes who made the lakes
I guess we have more fairies than monsters, I remember my grandma telling me that she saw fairies dancing in a circle on a meadow when she was young
They were motives in art and literature a lot
There is The Fairy of Velebit, Fairy Kosjenka from Tales of Long Ago, the paintings of [Vlaho Bukovac] etc
At least for me while growing up, I would hear so many tales about fairies
Omg I can relate to this so much
Especially when she starts yelling at me that I'm going to die if I don't eat lol
Your brain knows the rules and applies them without having to think about it
We just sort of know it
In Croatian we don't have articles to show the gender of the world, but to determine and prove the gender of a certain word, you say for example *this* table
In Croatian in the "this" part the gender is visible
For example:
ovaj stol (this table)-masculine
ova stolica (this chair)-feminine
ovo stablo (this tree)-neutrum
But of course, in the daily use of the language you don't always use "this", so it's common sense
You usually use this method when you're in school doing some grammar tasks and you need to determine the gender, you ask yourself what "this" would you use so that you surely determine the gender
no articles and if it did have some it woulde come naturally simple becuse its my native language i mean if you get good enough in english you stop worrying about articles and they start coming natrually
No articles, but we do have gendered words and declensions depend on the word gender
To find out the gender of the word, we usually use "this" in place of an article (masculine: "ovaj stol" - "this desk", feminine: "ova polica" - "this shelf", neuter: "ovo ljeto" - "this summer")
Same in Croatian
Yeah, looks strange to me too for it to be feminine
We usually use our word for "this" (ovaj/ova/ovo) in place of articles when trying to find out the "gender" of the word, and anything but "ovaj Bangladeš" would sound
weird
maybe its the fact i dont speak german but i dont think native speakers or people that are good at the language woulde have to guess but idk maybe im wrong about that assumption
There are a lot of movies from other countrys we have german cobra 11 uk movies too few from us and turkish ones were a lot of times seen
I don't think we have any stereotypes about us specifically
It's more generalization of "Balkan blob" and stereotypes that come with that
This is more of a generalized Balkan stereotype, but I hate it when people think we all hate each other, like nah, most people here are normal regular human beings and have nothing against other regular people from other countries
In Croatia there's a stereotype that you guys like to go hiking in flip flops, due to incidents where tourists go hiking wearing flip flops and inevitably have to be rescued
Isn’t there a stereotype that we drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigarettes
Same
Those stereotypes are probably for all of Balkan’s
not under 25C for sure and even then I'll reconsider if it's windy
10-12, I love colder weather, cant stand summer, if its above 25 its like my energy is being drained faster
A Dutch friend of mine told me that when it finally hits 20C in the Netherlands in spring everyone is outside wearing shorts
Here right now it's 15C (no wind and humid albeit cloudy) and I have a t-shirt, a sweater and a jacket on
It's not cold, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing only a hoodie
-King Tomislav,first king of Kingdom od Croatia
-Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan,leaders of the movement against Austrians
-Josip Jelacic,leader of the movement against Hungarians
-Ljudevit Gaj,Croatian language
-Ante Gotovina,general in Croatian Homeland war/War of the independence
-I would add Ante Pavelic,who established Croatia in WW2 after 800 years of foreign rule and Josip Broz Tito who established Yugoslavia and gained territory from Italy but these two were faschist and communist so yeah
in my region
[Andrijica Šimić] fought against ottomans
[Mijat Tomić] fought against ottomans
[Ivan Musić] of the Herzegovina uprising in western Herzegovian and a Catholic priest
[Mate Boban] of the self-proclaimed Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia
[Slobodan Praljak] during the war in the 90s
What about that student that set himself on fire I think post WWII
>who was born in our country Josip Broz Tito
what
had no idea that Kumrovec was in Slovenia
Lol "established croatia in ww2". As a puppet state maybe
And how long did that last
What a fucking hero
Why do we have to be the only fucking retards in this thread that have to name a fucking nazi
Why cant we be normal like the rest of europe
Ante pavelic, give me a fucking break
It's half-half wherever you go in ex-Yu
I dont like either but some people favor Pavelic and some favor Tito so I included them both haha although people who love Tito hate Pavelic and vice versa
I said that I dont like him but a lot of people(and you know it) like him smh
Yup, my bad
No problem, I also remember Jan III
Sobjeski from school
He was Polish as well, right
fine
we don't want him anyway
My Great-Grandfather fought in WW1
He was captured by the Russians but later joined them
When the Russian Civil War began, he was transported across Siberia to Vladivostok and then to the Salonica front, but the war ended before he got there
He also served in WW2 in the Independent State of Croatia
He was a local garrison commander but was secretly hiding a Jewish girl from the authorities
My grandfather and all of his brothers served in WW2 but most of them didn’t see combat
My father served in the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1996) but also never saw combat
My great-grandpa was in the partizani in ww2
A nice round 0
Weren’t the Emperors of Austria and Kings of Hungary the ones with the title “King of Jerusalem”?
Wtf
Interspar is the best German store, not Lidl
Kebab is overrated
What are some "fake" English words that are used in your country
I've noticed that it's quite "trendy" to use English words and change them up a bit for use in everyday conversations in a lot of countries
An example would be that young people in Germany (from my own experience) tend to say "He's so fame in Germany" "The song is really fame" etc in German, but with the "fame" sticking out
I recently discovered that party-breaker (or partibrejker) isn't used in english
The meaning is basically the same as "party pooper"
It's a fairly common term here, there is even a famous Serbian band named [Partibrejkers]
in istria, croatia we call jeans "rifle" but not rifle, as you'd read it in english, it's pronounced as it's written so you'd pronounce it "ree-fle" (fle part as in souffle)
probably someone, decades ago, brought the rifle jeans from a western country and people just read what it says
All have the same meaning in Croatian, except footing
Try to pearn a bit of croatian
People increase the prices if they hear you're a tourist
In Zagreb, a common scam is a person approaching you pretending to be deaf and mute with a leaflet asking for donations
Lol, where
And how would "dobar dan" on broken croatian with soft "r"s convince someone that you're croatian
I never heard of someone increasing their prices for tourists, what do you mean by that
Prices in restaurants and bars are fixed and are written in the menu, if anyone increased it it's easy to notice
The only possible location where they can increase the prices is the local markets but even they have their prices displayed
I dont know, usually its really easy to tell
Maybe they just thought you can speak it
Ahaaaaa, you mean ćevapi
Excellent choice
Who doesn't love a good old sarma mmm
Sharpen your knives roman army veteran and let's dance
Either the flag of Independent State of Croatia or any Yugoslav flag (including the flag of SR Croatia)
As with everything historic or even vaguely political, Croatia comes in with at least two opposing stances :D
I think if you remove the conatation on the SR flag, the flag is still quite  a boring flag ngl
rock paper sicors (idk spelling bruh) but more brutal
if you play rock and the other plays sicors you win and get to punch the other one in the shoulder
if you play paper and the other plays rock you win and get to slap them
if you play sicors and the other plays rock you win and take your index and middle finger(the ones you use to make the sicors) and slap the other person on the wrist
keep playing till someone wants to stop or a teacher gets mad
Krvava Kuna (Bloody Kuna [Croatian currency]): we would take a coin and spin it on the table
The game is actually stupid, there's no winner or anything, all you had to do is to keep it spinng by hitting it with your finger and whoever fails has to put their fist against the wall and the rest of us would shoot a coin at it
Sometimes you would end up with bloody knuckles, hence the name
Tapkanje (doesn't mean anything, comes from the sound of hitting the floor with your hands "TAP
"): anytime when there was a European or World cup in football all the boys would collect stickers
Now, instead of buying, we would put 2 stickers on the floor, one next to each other (face-up) and try to turn them face-down with our hands, but no grabbing, obviously, only using the vacuum your hands can make to lift them up
I was actually very good at this, I would fill up my entire album very quickly without buying new stickers very often
We did all of that, except for the break in line
We also had a game that we called "prćenje", which is a rude word for "leaning over". We'd line up, and kick the crossbar of a goal with the ball
The one who misses has to stand at the goal and lean over
We'd then kick the ball as hard as we could, while usually doing our best to hit the middle area under the ass, hoping that the ball will strike the nuts
Then there was the "magic circle". A group would approach an individual and one person would tap him on the shoulder, and then we'd punch and kick him until he names the person that tapped him
And finally, these weren't exactly games per se, but we also had the "paralysis" and the "slide". The latter would be running as fast as you could, and then use to marble floor to slide into someone's legs at a high velocity, while the former was running up to someone, and using your knee to hit them in the outer side of the thigh, the aim being hitting the nerve as hard as possible
I also very vaguely remember the mad cow disease thing
Someone would have the mad cow disease, and they would be ew to touch
There was a way to transfer it to another person, but I don't remember how it worked
I believe this gave birth to using "cattle" as an insult for individuals, regardless of them having the mad cow disease or not
We had exact same thing here in Croatia lol
I would say something like jebenti mater maybe
Well, the entire "greater Hungary" stuff is not really sitting too well here, and we still haven't forgotten about Khuen-Héderváry Károly, but TBH we got far bigger and more recent grievances with most of our other neighbors, so we're cool :)
Yeah, more or less
It's not always easy explaining medieval feudal concepts when we're more or less used to how modern states work, and 19th century and how people were trying to reform feudalism was often messy
We were the seperate kingdom, but under the same crown since 1097, joined at the hip for 800 years
Hungarian side was dominant in that relationship, but most of our shared history consists of fighting Ottomans side by side, so while there was some bad history between us, the majority was not bad
A lot of Croats are regulars on Sziget festival, or flying from/to Budapest Liszt Ferenc
I've been to Hungary several times, and I have some friends there, and I like it there - it's still a similar culture, cuisine, prices etc
Although I have to say I haven't picked up much Hungarian apart from the basics such as "szia", "köszi", "sör", "nem beszélek magyarul, beszélsz angolul
" and "baszd meg, kurva anyád". I was actually supposed to go to Hungary twice this year, but unfortunately COVID happened :( It would've been fun
Oh my God, this game
I visited Finland on a student exchange last year and we I played this with my host
M friends also played it with their hosts, literally every single person has it in their home
In croatia its called Čovječe ne ljuti se and is enjoyed by people of all ages
Id say for me it gets more vicious than monopoly
Everyone knows the beautiful Croatian coast and Zagreb with the best European advent but noone knows about Osijek
Osijek is a town with 100k people so it is fairly big on Croatian standards
It is situated on the Drava river in the east of Croatia near Hungary and Serbia between the Slavonia and Baranja regions of the Pannonian Basin
Osijek has an old town Tvrđa which is currently on the might be UNESCO heritage list
It is old dating from the 16th century with the old wall looking at the river
In Tvrđa itself you have cobblestone streets with old classy buildings all around with schools everywhere
Other than Tvrđa Osijek has a hanging bridge which has lights at night and the main square and the town itself has old style Austro-Hungarian architecture and buildings
The concathedral is very tall being second tallest in Croatia after Zagreb(currently tallest since the Zagreb cathedral suffered from earthquakes) and is a gothic style cathedral
Along the river you can walk throughout the whole length of the city and also Trams which are the first ones in Croatia and still go through the whole city
Also the oldest  national theatre is here in Osijek too
Zagreb, the largest city in Croatia
It’s the capital, but all tourists go to the Croatian coast, so they don’t care about it because it’s in the interior
You should know of Pecs definitely , I'm no Hungarian but on the border there in Croatia
Pecs is a city in the Baranya region where the geothermal springs come out
You have several villages around Pecs with a lot of them having geothermal baths
Pecs itself is on a mountain basin and has the usual Austro-Hungarian architecture with the town hall being very beautiful and the old town is self is charming with parks,squares and statues everywhere
Other than Pecs I don't really know what to say as I have only been to Budapest which is very famous but I heard Gyor is quite nice too and also Kaposvár.
Austro-Ugarska monarhija in Croatian
Austro - Ugarska monarhija (Austro - Hungarian monarchy), if separately speaking then Carevina Austrija (empire of Austria) and Kraljevina Ugarska (kingdom of Hungary)
Commonly: just Austro-Ugarska (Austria-Hungary)
Also sometimes Habsburška monarhija (Habsburg monarchy)
Austro-Ugarska
People look back to the past and not think about present or future
We can change our constitution through a national referendum
I beleve its only happened twice so far

"verati" is an old word for "to climb" so I assume that's where the word comes from
A few
Not recognising Armenian genocide being one of them
Same here, some of our weapons even ended in ISIS hands
I'm curious, do our people actually think that it didn't happen or is our government just lying to itsself
Huh oh boy, we suck up to turkey everytime we can, along with that we also suck up to israel and usavall the time also and all decisions they make we support, and lately we are starting to suck up to china
The government not wanting to piss off Turkey I believe
Kim can’t afford them
That’s the line

Weather nazis were good or bad
Ožujko vs Karlovačko vs Pan  beer
I've never heard anyone unironically defend the Ustaše,I've heard people defend communism though
Nope, nope, nope
This is classic example of "everyone with whom I don't agree is a nazi"
Debate most of the time is who was ustasha, partizan, domobran or chetnik
And whether partizans were good like they are represented or better yet is killing people a crime even if it's for a good cause and other stuff like that, no one is actually defending the nazis, no one sane at least, the debate is around partizan's and was their cause just based on what it brought to Croatia as a consequence along with their treatment of war prisoners
Akso this is not seneless or stupid, history need to be taught so it is not repeated, far more stupid thing is argument about whether burek with cheese is really a burek
Hint: It is
Slovenians
Hold my beer
Im still bus guy since my country is not very reliable in railways department
Croatia isn't shown so much in movies as much as it is talked about as some 3rd world country somewhere far away
Yes, I learned when I was 3
I know a lot of people
I'd like a game set during Dutch golden age
We call Slovenian Janezi
Male name in Slovenia is Janez
Wwii period, the croatian kingdom and the croatian war of independence
Of course the victory in the 90s war with Serbia, and thats cool I guess
But also, Independent state of Croatia
WW2 Nazi puppet and Ustaše movement
not so cool
Yeah, duck and turkey being the most common, goose perhaps if someone has its own
I prefer ducks and turkey
Rijeka is the ugliest town in Croatia imo
it's one of the only towns with terrible weather, it looks industrial and unwelcoming
it always rains, roads are tiny and always too crowded, there is no straight part and everything is full of steep streets and you are constantly walking either downhill or uphill
ugly and impractical town
Ill say rijeka from the bigger ones (ex-industrial, port town with a mishmash of every style possible)
For smaller ones there are dozens of candidazes
Inland is full of former industrial towns where the single employing industry collapsed/bankrupted/left and/or war happened and now they are just depressing
Bigger cities and places on the coast have tourism as a fall back, these are stuck
Opatija:
Rijeka:
Have you never been to Sisak or Beli Manastir
Yes definitely, Rijeka was just built on a cliff and it got big because Austria-Hungary needed a port somewhere
Streets steep and small, currently half of the city is digged up I don't know how they got for European capital of Culture
Inland towns such as Glina or a city like Slavonski Brod where industries didnt really collapse but the city itself is just fucked
Water is bad, air is awful and it is in the poorest county
I have never been to either
The sea should be the one afraid [of the dutch]
Using "sumljam" instead of "sumnjam". While sumnjati means to doubt something
I heard about mistaking your and you\`re but I didn't notice that at all in my English classes
Also "valda" instead of "valjda"!
It's totally normal for us Dalmatians to say "reka" tho and nobody cares
Croats also struggle with "u redu".
Hey
That's regional
Since average salary in Finland is pretty standard for a developed EU nation, it absolutely makes it an outlier if they really pay their interns that much (compared to other countries where the relative intern pay is orders of magnitude lower)
It was unbelievable
You could just look up and not see the end of some of them
And they are everywhere lol
But subway stations are really dirty and unwelcoming, feel like they should work on that
In Croatian, “Despicable Me” was translated as “How Gru stole the Moon” (Kako je Gru ukrao Mjesec)
“Die Hard” became “Die Manly” (Umri muški)
Or even better, Die Like a Man
Exactly the same thing happened to me
I was very fortunate and agile so he hasn't carried out the act until the end but it is still extremelly traumatising
I still have issues walking alone in the dark, even through a very safe and familiar neighbourhoods
The act is so over-the-top you can't help but like it, just for the sheer silliness of it
So we could say that WWII was domestic abuse
I rarely see any other type of window
Those are just normal windows to me, funny how the guy in the video finds them so amazing
Literally every building has them
It's just a window, mate
Exactly that
We have a similar thing, we call toothpaste *kaladont* thanks to the monopoly of one austrian [toothpaste manufacturer] back in the day
Agadmator, and I don’t even care about chess that much
KAMBER izam
He’s awesome
I found him recently and binged all his videos
Oof I really don’t know
Cats personally, 100%. Though I like dogs too, but I'm kinda scared of some of them and in my opinion cats are just much cuter
Nationally it's probably 50-50, personally I've met plenty of both dog and cat people
And I can't really guess about the continental preference since I haven't been to every country in Europe
I'm a snake person
As for the furry friends, no preference really
In croatia, i see lots of people with dogs, since they are more handy for hunting, running and sniffing out stuff in the countryside, and i think the fact so many people have dogs in the countryside gave people a trust for dogs, so there’s lots in cities too
This says a lot because I have noticed a lot of Brits are more cat people than dog people
The Irish yet again win, I wish there was someone to analyze this
I would say rusyn
Istriot, spoken by 400 people in southwestern Istria, mostly in Rovinj
Wait, indonesia has 700 languages
How is that possible
I always thought india leads in language diversity but i guess i was so wrong
How are those languages different
Can people understand each other with ease
Can you give me a comparison maybe
What does size have to do with it
By that logic russia should have 50
000 languages
I know, man, i'm just saying that the size doesnt matter that much, its the islands and isolation
There are bigger countries out there with a fraction of the languages you have
These are for Luxembourg
Not necessarily unknown but interesting nevertheless
SES S.A. (Astra) - one of the world's biggest telecommunication satellite operator, headquartered in Betzdorf
ArcelorMittal - world biggest steel producer
And obvious one
RTL Group - Radio Television Luxembourg, one of the biggest TV groups in  Europe, having presence in many European countries
They are often thought of as a German company, but they're actually Luxembourgish
I think there's kind of a similar situation in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the RS constitution allowing the use of capital punishment but the overall BiH constitution forbidding it
Actually I just checked it out and it seems that the Constitutional court of Bosnia and Herzegovina finally came around to officially insist on banning the death penalty in RS
It happened just a few days ago
Yes and that's my pet peeve when it comes to it, it's less of a geographical denominator and has more to do with politics
The only correct answer here
Thanks bud
I fly from Venice, much closer, some even go to Budapest
Why would we exclude Greece
It's right next to the Balkan mountain range in Bulgaria
From a Croat point of view (how I was taught in primary school), we include Slovenia and southern parts of Romania around the Danube as Balkans as well
Hungary is Central Europe
Athens doesn't ring a bell
Or Istanbul
Why wouldn't it be
booo mitteleuropa nerd here
Neither is Croatia and Slovenia but here we are
And Croatia and Slovenia would be
because
Ok, sure, why
Ok, fair enough
I would normally say it's failure of the British public school system except that that term, the Balkans, is a so very nebulous term that has less to do with geography, and more to do with politics
And perceptions
Wait till you learn about Croatian coast
Ok, fair enough, but then why use the term when you consciously know it isn't right
And I'm asking honest to God question here because I am curious as hell
Wouldn't it be like me saying "the English" when referring to Scots, Irish and Welsh people even though I know it's incorrect
But where is the Balkan mountain range situated
And Romania isn't a Slavic country
You are kinda equating ex-Yu with the term which further adds to the confusion
True, but whenever I feel sad I remember the US and everything seems better
No need to apologize and thank you for the feedback and clarification
I mean not literally in the backyard, but there are constant diggings around our coast and islands, finding some Roman or Byzantine artifacts
City I grew up has a couple of Venetian forts overlooking the cities from 15th and 16th century, and a Cathedral built in the same time period
A city I currently live has a Roman palace in it's center and couple of Roman aqueduct ruins laying around
Digging in the backyard not likely, but there are roman ruins in the cifies and countryside, there are medieval castles about and many churches are also quite old
So i would say its pretty common
Even most of government and cultural buildings are from 19th century
In my hometown, of some 30 000 people, there's a part of [14th century defensive wall] behind the cathedral finished in 1882
So there's that
The history ends with Croatian war of independence, and in truth that is the way it should be, now bear with me, it's not a nationalistic view
The thing is, our participation in EU is relatively short, and it needs to pass more than 20-30 years to make a serious historical oversight of it
Other than that, EU is studied in a lesser degree in lessons about the rest of the world during the 50s to 90s, but enough to understand political dealings, of course, I'm only talking about history, and this should probably be studied in a subject that teaches more about politics, everyday stuff and etc
There are subjects that explain that in high school, but they are interested only in the economical or political sides of it, they mostly don't bring full context to it
In Croatia we say "ptičica" which means "little bird"
In Croatian we say “Ptičica
” (Birdie
) with a very cheerful intonation
"i" is pronounced similar to english "ee" and there's 2 of those in that word
Just don’t say anything about the early to mid 90’s and it’ll be fine
I'm always astounded how massive Malta's population is
I mean I thought our island of Brač (pop ~14,000, 400km^2) was decently populated and then I read somewhere that Malta has a population of more than 500,000 on an area of a bit more than 300km^2
No shit, they all came here to us for a little dip in the sea
I cant even enter my living room at day time without getting stung
though I must say there might be a little less of them this year
It's our new plan of attack
A shit, shouldn't have said anything
i think Ireland would fall apart, like litteraly a fall apart in 30-is different countries and everyone would become separate island and drift off to Atlantic that would be known as ocean of sadness
UK would do the same but they are already heading for shitstorm that potatoes vanishing would be just
one of sucky days
fish with fish fingers
We would be sitting with the other Balkan nations  way too drunk off Rakija, trying to cut the table in parts so we don’t collectively get in a fist fight that starts WWIII
We’d also be eyeing the cute Irish and smirking at England knowing how we did during the World Cup
Some interesting trivia is sure to be skipped
Really cool one is that a Croat was the last king of Hawaii
Technically a prince consort as it seems
I took some liberty here
Technically he was a prince-consort ,but he was married to the last queen of Hawaii

They are growing in popularity
Usually run by the Catholic Church, they send young people for a week somewhere on the coast
It consists of masses, sports, lectures, etc
I went a few times, not too expensive and a great way to meet new people with the same values
If you can't afford, sometimes a local priest pays for it
Mine too
completely agree
I don't expect foreign schools to teach about Croatian history
I am so much dissapointed that people don't learn about Nikola Zrinski/Miklos Zrinyi and Siege of Szigetvar
That last stand is something that rivals Battle of Thermopylae
You do taxes like Americans
We have it all calculated by the state (employers pay it)
I just from time to time get tax return and I have no idea why
A present
And what’s difficult with buying or renting apartments that you need to learn in school
Hitler was Austrian not German
Austrian as a national identity distinct from German was only born post WW2 when everyone wanted to distance themselves from Germany and it's Nazi reputation
Before that Austria was just one of many German states and pretty much all Austrians considered themselves Germans
I guess "always" started in 1918
I think Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was one of the first countries to recognise USA
Really ? How does Croatia show up ?
"Austrian identity" existed but it wasn't any less German than Prussian or Bavarian identity at the time
There's a reason why after WW1 you named your country [German Austria] and the allies forced you to change the name, there's a reason the treaty of Versailles had to forbid you from joining Germany
And there's a reason why you eventually did join Germany
The reason being that at the time overwhelming majority of Austrians absolutely felt German
So you didn’t learn it in school
Made by IPSOS one of the most renown survey companies, I don't know why you would dismiss it as useless
2020 - 55%
2019 - 44%
2018 - 51%
2017 - 49%
2016 - 48%
2015 - 52%
2014 - 45%
Hahahahaha
May 1st is holiday, but if it falls on weekend then you are out of luck
No, they’re never shifted in Croatia
once a day, usually before work or faculty classes
however if i go to doctor, do sports lr going out then I also take shower before
I have pizza cutter somewhere in the dusty drawer
It a) comes precut or b) I use a knife to cut it to slices
I feel like I would be one of the weirded out guys
At this point, I'm now wondering, is cutting the pizza with scissors the correct way
I feel like everyone in Slavonia, Srijem and Bosnia jokes about Herzegovina
For instance, there is a tweet that says "Greetings from the capitol of Herzegovina"
And it's a picture of Zagreb
For all of you not familiar with the fact, Zagreb has a high number of people from Herzegovina
Zagreb because it is the capital and hogs most of the media so we always joke about them
They also have a mayor[Milan Bandić] who is quite an astonishing fella
No, thank you, we're full
Very well put
Short and to the point
Pretty much on point
I would just like to add that due to a massive influx of southerners (including Croats from B&H), certain parts of Zagreb don't even feel like Zagreb, people are much more extroverted and politically to the right
Also a reason why there is some level of animosity towards Rijeka which is traditionally the most left wing city in Croatia probably
Zagreb is to Croatia what New York is to the world, you can find people from every little corner of our country
Hell, sometimes it's hard to find someone who is even a 3rd gen native
You're right
Various foreign powers held the cities at some point
For example, Zagreb has German name - Agram and Osijek - Esseg (it has Hungarian and Turkish variant aswell)
Recommend for a trip or a longer period
Like 90% are mandatory
The flu shot is optional and I may be missing some other vaccines, not sure
Most often localised names are used, sometimes are not
Charlemagne is always Karlo Veliki
Louis XIV is Luj XIV
While George is more often George though some used the name Đuro which sounds kinda funny
Modern monarchs except Elizabeth are refered in their original
To me it's so wierd how the queen is Elizabeta II but her sons and grandsons are Charles, Harry
So you're telling me i wont be able to open my own hotel with 5 cents
I beg to differ
There are some countries i'd theoretically like to move to because i'm getting sick of primitivism here but not a lot
I also think that it's the classic case of the grass is always greener and that other countries dont have it any better than us here
For example, germany is not one of those countries
I've lived there for a year when i was studying and i had enough
Germans are strange, hard to live amongst
Dont get me wrong, i like germany as a nation and i have a lot of german friends but i'm just not used to your mentality
I believe its the same other way around, you'd come here and be amazed how lazy we are
But that's just depending on what you're used to
For me most germans are like robots, until you come here for your vacation and go crazy
This summer me and a couple of friends bought a small boat and we went around the islands here and we talked about how we have this every summer, for free, while people pay thousands of euros to come here for 1 week
I literally think i'd kill myself if i had the sea for 1 week per year
I cant live without it
I really think that the quality of life, especially for kids is better in croatia than in a bunch of other more developed west european countries
That being said, there's an obvious problem with corruption, health care and other stuff so yeah, you win some, you lose some
I don't have a lot of experience, but a common tradition in shift work jobs here is, if you work the late/night shift, to take regular smoke breaks and stay at work an hour longer to make sure the morning shift (aka me) has to do every fucking thing you didn't do
Also when you come back in the afternoon, make sure to tell complain about staying longer at work despite not doing anything
On birthdays and special occasions (weddings, births, awards) you bring cake or pastries or even fingerfood for the office
Hm,  if you wanted to  I could give you 100 + rock songs from Croatia, but  none of them quite have something to do with Croatia in a musical sense (and if they do chances are they aren't that popular)
The first song that comes to my mind however is [Kletva Kralja Zvonimira] (King Zvonimir's curse) from Marko Perković Thompson
It tells the legend of the curse that king Zvonimir (last croatian king from the middle ages) allegedly throwed upon his subjects and murderers who betrayed him
The main riff has a lot of similarities with traditional croatian folk songs and it keeps a very "national" vibe
Now, Thompson is a very controversial ultra right winged singer (I personally completely disagree with his views), but this song and the album in particular have nothing contoversial whatsoever and focus more on the distant croatian past
&#x200B;
If you are looking for something a bit more conventional here's Atomsko [Skolinšte] and  [Parni Valjak]
&#x200B;
Hope you find something you'll like :D
Ante Pavelic
He was a Nazi puppet leader :(.
>an addiction to building castles
Albania : Hold my concrete
an idiot
yes he was for sure, but insane, that is a reach, I've been thinking habsburgs were rulers for some time and some of them were quite insanse
Noone is crazier than Stalin
Croatia checking in
[Tomislav Horvatincic (results on Croatian)] local crook and businessman who has friends among politicians, killed older Italian couple with his boat
He basically slammed into their smaller boat while his starlet girlfriend was giving him a blowjob
He was explaining it as having syncope, rare medical condition where you pass ~~away~~ out from having too much blood in your brain
The shit happened in 2011
, he was convicted but using various loopholes he's still walking around as a free man
Oh these are not the only people he killed, there were more in late 80s but nobody gives a fuck about those poor souls right
He's typical Croatian rich idiot who does whatever he wants while government steers the looks on the other side
&#x200B;
This is just one of dozens other stories like this, no wonder young people are fleeing the country
&#x200B;
Edit: words
Lmao when I was in Chezcia I was saying 'hvala' (how we say thank you), just assumed it was at least similar so people would understand it
Turns out it's not even close lol
It's been a while since I was in high so there's a fat chance at least something was added or removed, but aside from a whole bunch of Croatian stuff, some popular foreign stuff, in no particular order, are: Kafka's Transformation and the Trial, Poe's Murder in the Rue Morgue and Black Cat, Divine Comedy, the Decameron, Crime and Punishment, both Iliad and the Odyssey, Don Quijote, a bunch of Shakespeare's stuff including the popular Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Hamlet, some Russian stuff like Gogol's the Overcoat and Dead Souls, Anna Karenina, A Hero of Out Time etc
The Sorrows of Young Werther, Old Goriot, and there's a whole lot more than I can remember
I mean its about a dozen books each year on mandatory list and about three times as much where you have an excerpt and talk about it
Each year gets chronologically closer to modern times (starting from Illiad in first grade) with mix of foreign (mostly eutopean until 20th century) and domestic authors
We go over all of the authors listed as well, some being read in full (Zola, Moliere, Voltaire, Camus, Balzac, Flaubert, Corneille) and learn about some of them and read excerpts of texts :)
Romeo and Juliet is 8th grade of elementary school
Metamorphosis is mandatory reading in our highschools
A lot of them, besteck comes to mind first
There's also another word for that, escajg (Esszeug)
I recognize many words that are used in Croatian:
Semmel - žemlja
Krapfen - krafna
Palatschinken - palačinke
Paradeiser - paradajz
Karfiol - karfiol
Ribisel - ribiz(l)
Faschiertes - faširano
Good job remembering all these words
Do you use some form of vešmašina (Waschmaschine) or flajšmašina (Fleischmaschine)
Cutlery
How do you spell Schraube in your dialect
In my experience, it's either "paradajz" (continental) or "pomidor" (coastal), "rajčica" is used only as an "official" word (y'know, the one nobody uses but those who must :) )
Yes, we got a lot of words from Austria
Also, raj = paradise
Could be, long haired teen here
I often feel like I'm getting weirder looks from the people of my age than the people who grew up in the 80s or so
Bogomoljka in Croatian, with the same meaning
One of my fav classical pieces, I still remember vividly my music professor in high school explaining different parts of the piece and how they represent different flows of the river or the events around it and being mind blown
Check our sous le ciel de paris as well, i love that one
"Oh, you mean Yugoslavia
Croatia is western Serbia
Living in Istria, a lot of Italian people living Here (it was under Italia 1920 - 1943) and we hate it when they call us Italian
No, we don't even like them that much, burned our villages a century ago
Edit: spelling
Catholic Serbia* although people who say this are aware how triggering it is
By digging a pit followed by swift shooting
Shot 'em if we could catch 'em
>I think more people died in those years then in ww2
Not by a long shot
I mean the Home guard was a collaborationist militia controlled by the Germans
Since me and my spouse do everyday communication over IM (messenger, hangouts, Viber, whatnot), if I get a *call*, I know it's serious, so yeah, I'd answer it, but in a hall or common room, so as not to bother colleagues
If what I'm told over the phone is serious enough to require me to leave the office, then I work those hours during the weekend to make up for the lost time
It works the other way too - if I get a call from a colleague while on day off or vacation, I expect it will be something serious enough to warrant a call, so I mentally prepare for the shitstorm and answer
Well tbf the ones singing in Zagreb are mostly tourists
Eather in Croatia, we consider it a normal thing to do
For Croatia I think the first one would be back in the middle ages when king Tomislav united the Croatian people from the coast with the people inland(lower Pannonia)
This unification made us stick together for all those centuries under different occupations and made Croatia the country it is today
Other events are probably in the 19th century with the Croatian(Illirian) rebirth period when our language,anthem and identity were re-established and of course 1848
when the whole revolution happened
Modern day event is definitely the fall of Yugoslavia and our 4-year war(1991-1995) period against Serbs in Croatia and the JNA
The establishment of Yugoslavia is also very important after WW1 and although we don't like to mention this, WW2 and the NDH period also had an influence later on with forming of our modern day state
Seems to me it is a defining moment for *the world*, not only France
It caused ripple effects across the world, and basically ushered in a new era
Sarma
But I'm not a good person to ask this, I'm a horribly picky eater
I will say heresy but I never order ćevapi in a restaurant
Few times I ordered them I realized I had made a mistake
I like normal cut of meat over grill, or if minced it has to be lamb or veil in some sauce
I eat minced meat at home but if I pay restaurant prices I won't pay for overhyped minced meat over gill served with raw onion and spoon of ajvar along side
I know a lot of people who don't like this dish, but I absolutely adore blood sausages (krvavice), especially with baked or mashed potatoes and sauerkraut
But I despise fileki or tripice (tripe in English), the smell while cooking is unbearable to me
I also hate sarma, along with grah, whenever I tell people, they go berserk
I'm not a picky eater, I just have different palate, I'll try anything once, but if I don't like the taste, then I won't eat it again, life is too short to eat food you don't like
Ćevapi isn't restaurant food, never understood it
Oh yeah, I hate grah too
But I didn't think that's a very popular food in Croatia, I mostly relate it to going to Sljeme, and old people fighting over free beans when they cook it on squares or something
The tripe thing I can agree on
But I don't get what's to hate about fish and chips haha
Depends what you wamt to try, it's diverse, you have food from parts of Croatia, parts of Montenegro, Albania and Greece that is Mediterranean in nature, then you have typical greasy, heavy food coming from continental parts of the same countries influenced by Germanic and Turkish cuisines, and in the end you have something entirely that is uniquely Balkan
Check [this list] for Croatia, it has food from all the regions, so you have light Sea food, Heavy, greasy for people from cold areas, classic continental, and everything in between
Work less and have so much free time to have a coffee with some randos and complain about the country while not working
(Atleast in Dalmatian region)
Same in Croatia, I haven't missed a single Christmas without watching at least one of the Home Alone movies
In croatia its always 2
Always
You better not do it 3 times
4 is unusual but ok so if you make a mistake and go for the third you better pretend like you wanted to make it 4
Its common between family members (parents, aunts, cousins, etc) and friends that you havent seen in a while
Weird, here "luftati" means to open the windows to improve the air quality inside
I think we use "propuhati" for that use (propuh = promaja)
[Museum of broken relationships] in Zagreb, Croatia
People are donating their stuff they've got from their ex's, each item has a story that is displayed along the item itself
As much as it's interesting it's also a bit sad at the moments
Some fine but lesser known museums are
[Krapina Neandethral Museum]
[Museum of pre-historic Vučedol culture]
[Museum of Croatian Naïve art] a surprising number of tourists in Zagreb told me that they really liked it, so I always recommend it
Not really prevalent
6 restaurants in Zagreb, 1 in Zadar, 1 in Split
McDonald's is much more prevalent with its 36 restaurants countrywide
But I guess KFC is still bigger here than other US fast food chains - Burger King has 5 restaurants, Subway has 2, Domino's has only 1
No other US chains here
Poland the catholic brother, Albania the i dont get how were friends and Israel the country I wanna be friends with
I'll go with Poland
Slavs, similar historical context and we both love John Paul II
Also, they get mentioned quite often here as a country we should look up to
Conservative values and growing economy
Well, Italy (though we do share a maritime border) and Austria
Croatia - Italy
Sea border
Yay
Yes,  but Federal Republic of Serbia still didn't border Greece
Is that just beacuse of the economy or something else
Because the south always seemed more interesting and fun to me
Serbia: Visiting hometown where my family resided for 200 years before being kicked out, met some nice people there
Czech: Eh, was drunk most of my 7 day stay there, but I really loved Škoda factory and museum, had a unique opportunity to actually translate for a whole tour from English to Croatian there
Wien, Austria: Like the whole city, really reminded me of my hometown based on architecture, just much much bigger
Czech Republic: Hugging a girl I really like
Slovenia: Singing and hanging with friends is a bus
Italia: Really deep and fun conversation in Biella
Bosnia: Watching horrors with my cousin
Why if I may ask
Istria would be my answer
They have a strong sense of self-identity and are relatively rich region with few roads leading in
I was reading this and was confused about crete
Then I got to patriotic part
Also hats down to crete people
On a few occasions our national TV aired documentary about force of resistance on crete that hid australian and british naval intelligence agents
So if we buy burgenland under the idea of croatian minority living there, this means flr the first time since 10th century after hungarians settled in pannonian basin, south and west slavs would be connected
Alright slovenians, this is bigger than us both, lets merge our euros and kunas and buy it
I remember that chaos
it was all over the news
I discussed it with my friends what a beatiful fuck you to government that was
Yeah
jokes aside it's funny to me how that corridor would "correct" division from 9th century
I mean cmon it's been 1000 years
Nah, just buy it
Same
I know a few people from Croatia that went to Serbia to do volunteer work in an animal shelter, because they had so many dogs they couldn't keep up with the amount of cleaning needed (and were in dire straights when it came to food, like, all the time)
It depends
With younger kids and parties at someones home, usually parents stay and socialize
Most of the time parents know each other as well from teacher-parent or kindergarten meetings
So it is not unusual
Most parents stay for their own gathering
We have examples from all tgree main dialects in our literature and literary history, we learn specificities
As for faculty level education in specific dialects, have no idea
Cheese spread, polony and cheese (gouda)
Time to vote Monarchist
Seriously though, what is the Austrian monarchist platform anyway, aside from wanting a Habsburg restoration
I heard they gained some limited political presence
They occasionally and amusingly pop over here for a brief news interview (like, once every couple of years)
I'm not sure why they bother, but I kinda like it, makes me feel like we're still connected in a way
Anyway, last I heard of them I think they talked about gaining some seats somewhere, though I guess that was likely in some regional parliament or even some municipal council
Hah, and I'd second your sentiment about the monarchy - in theory I'd like them restored here as well, but that ain't happening, ever
And I have serious doubts about the usefulness of something like that implemented over here - I think 20 years of having a hated Serbian monarchy followed by 45 years of communism pretty much destroyed any possibility of a constitutional monarchy being practical in Croatia
That said, I always wanted to see Austria return to being a monarchy - republican Austria was always
weird to me
Just felt wrong
Theoretically they could gain a lot, but I doubt any modern republic could become a monarchy again
As for what they could gain, well that depends on what the country in question is like, regarding culture and tradition
In an ideal situation, a constitutional monarch is a living, breathing avatar of both the state and the nation, embodying centuries or millenia of history and tradition
In the right circumstances, that can be a powerful stability-enhancing tool that can reinforce political moderation, and act as stronger barrier against authoritarianism than an elected head of state can be
I could go on a lot, there are lots of theoretical benefits, but so far most of them have only truly been exploited by Europe’s wealthiest and most developed nations - I have strong doubts about how useful the introduction of such a model would be in comparatively poorer, more corruption-prone and democratically weaker countries
Switzerland, because of bunkers
Switzerland, definitely
I love their gun policy, cities and mountains
If your time is valuable to you then very very expensive
I honestly have no idea
Trains in my part of the country are shitty and extremely slow
It takes 5+ hours for 1
5h car trip or 2
5h bus trip
I think I have ridden the train in my country maybe five times in my life
A train from my city to other city around 20 ish km is 15 kuna or around 2 euro
An intracity ticket for one-way trip of 15 km is cca 1
5€. An intercity ticket for a 250 km trip is 15€.
However, there is a higher pricer you pay for taking the train here
The price of your sanity when they casually announce train is late hour and a half because *insert random reason*.
>especially since Paris has fewer inhabitants than Berlin
Paris proper just has a way narrower definition and only includes the city center
What you're referring to is Paris proper which has 2
1m people and an area of 105km2, but you're comparing it to area of 891km2 in Berlin and it's 3
7m people
It'd be more accurate to compare the greater Paris which is 814km2 and has 7
1m people
Dundo Maroje by Marin Držić
I think this is the official answer of every Croat
It is written in an old Dubrovnik dialect, sometimes in German or Italian
If the translations aren't at the bottom of the page you are officially f-ed
The story is also very dependent on the old style humor which can be a turn off for some
I found it charming more than hilarious
I found Krleža's Povratak Filipa Latinovicza (The return of Filip Latinovicz) harder to read than Dundo Maroje
Not saying renaissance Dubrovnik Croatian is easy to read, but Krleža's sentences were far too tedious and complicated, and hard for me to follow through
Even though it is very hard to read and that just makes it an automatic turn off, I still very enjoyed the story and  that it uses these characters to send a message to the Dubrovnik nobility
Another book I would put on this list is Zlatarovo zlato by August Šenoa
I despise this book and find it boring af
Is Sienkiewicz any good
My dad was a huge fan and used to tell me how he used to read *In desert and wilderness* during the siege of Sarajevo when he had the time
*Quo vadis
* is on my TBR list for a long time now
I watched the film when I was a kid
It was fun
I've never read the book
It has a huge tonal shift in the middle rivaling From Dusk Till Dawn
It is here as well
Beautiful
I can attest that huncut means the same in Croatian
As does rit
Come to think of it, also rasrđen is used, though I had to pronounce it before I could understand it
You Polish folks sure love to complicate things with all those s's and z's
Everyone kept telling me French people are rude and refuse to speak english
Every French person I met spoke english and was very polite
I agree with that and that's all true, but the reason investing and real estate is so much more popular in the US is the tax deduction and very lax tax laws
It's just more profitable and easier there, as they have some (weird and fucked up) laws that make it work flawlessly
In turn, however, that's what makes the infamous separation between upper and lower class so widespread
The rich make more profit and pay less tax and then they buy more properties/shares
Constantly, and it's really annoying
Unfortunately yes
I am ashamed of that
Yes I have forgoten for the english word (I've actually forgot the word writing this)
definitely, but good things is in Croatia basically everyone speaks English so you can without any problems do a bilingual talk, its very common in younger generation
Foreigners, what Nordic language sounds the best
It is tho, so exotic
HRT 1 which is short for "Hrvatska radiotelevizija 1" (Croatian Radiotelevision 1)
Basically new Yugoslavia including Hungary and excluding North Macedonia
Slovenia- no more border disputes, the only reasons why they dislike us
So I guess OK
Hungary- this would be silly
Atleast we would save Hungary from Orban
Bosnia- they will atleast get a more stable government, but I doubt they would be happy in Croatia
Serbia- I guess this is not that good of an idea
Probably bad idea
Montenegro- Yay
More beaches=more tourists
I think they would be OK under Rep
Of Croatia
Describe closest; it should probably be Bosnia, not so really
*nervous sweating*
Happy marriages all round
It is not our neighboring country
Without Croatia
I wouldn't mind another Austria-Hungary if it was called Austria-Hungary-Croatia
Yes, but we're not neighbouring countries
I am actually curious, how did you witness the Yugoslav war
Sometimes yes but sometimes we let them eat first then let them go play or the other way around we eat if they are playing and then they do
I Ride my bike while I wat I don't see the problem if you're hungry just eat nobofy is gonna stop you
Oh yeah sobody has to clean that up just beacouse you couldn't wait
Heard it's a thing in japan, japan is a very clean country so eating while walking is seen like you're messy
"Croats eate children"
Back from the 30-year long protestant war in Germany
Some English fuck wanted to write about it
Edit: nvm misunderstood the question but still
Bismarck supposedly said: " Croats don't know what they want, but they want it now !"
So true
So first of all you got the digits1 - jedan, 2 - dva, 3 - tri, 4 -četiri, 5 - pet, 6 - šest, 7 - sedam, 8 - osam, 9 - devet and 0 - nula
Then from 10 - 20 is the (digit number) + deset (word for 10)20, 30, 40 etc
are in the same vain (digit name) + desetNon whole tens are pretty simple as well
Just (the name of the ten) + i (and in Serbo-Croatian) + (digit)
And all the numbers are done in this way
EDIT: Forgot to add, these are all normally said in a very slurred manner, like the rest of our language, unless you're in Croatian class lol
It is basic declension
The "fun" stuff about inflection languages
Wait, wait, wait
Slovenians have the German system of 20s and so on
Why
I always thought you were like any other Slavs
guess Austrians have influenced Slovenia A LOT
You live and learn each day
Cool
>Forgot to add, these are all normally said in a very slurred manner, like the rest of our language, unless you're in Croatian class lol
Yeah hahah like *"Dvadeset"* (20) becomes *"dvaest"* or *"dvajst"*.
In Croatian it is the 5th that is different
So:
-1 pas, 2 psa, 3 psa, 4 psa, 5 p**a**sa, etc
Yeah
At least they are not bad
just
weird
Lol But Slovenia can still into Slav
Good boi Slovenia
I think the conclusion here is that all Slavic langauhes are VERY similar
Most of the old rules are present in every Slavic language in some form
God, I love Slavic languages and our culture hahaha
My town has an old abandoned military base
It was used during Yugoslavia and abandoned after independence as military shrunk
It consists of several buildings for housing soldiers, staff and administration and several hangars used for ammunition and military hardware storage
For a decade and a half it's been abandoned and decaying
Lately, however, the city has decided to repurpose it for several new uses instead of letting it rot
A very smart move welcomed by citizens
Nowadays, most of it has been refurbished and renovated
There are couple of small private firms operating there, our police station and firefighters have been transfered there from their old locations in packed city centre
There is a kindergarden, public garden where citizens can plant their veggies, dog park and, best of all, local youth centre, which now hosts numerous social events and serves as a hub for teenagers going out
All of that is build on top of old military buildings and hangars
My hometown's barracks got taken over by a bunch of local rascals during Yugoslav Wars and repurposed as a concert hall for punk rockers lol

They were huge here 10-15 years ago but people probably have no idea they're German
Everyone knows 'everytime we touch'
Not only DOTA players, there wasn't a teenager in my neighbourhood in 2009/10 who didn't have 'all i ever wanted', 'boten anna' and 'now you're gone' on their phone
I'm not saying her music is good though :D
I was also surprised when some of her songs had 300+ million views on youtube
Here, it’s generally accepted you say “Bok” (a greeting) to someone if you’re passing them, with not many other people in sight
I came to exchange in france
It is not obligatory (but also not frowned upon) to greet upon entering the bus
So I got stopped by the driver several times for not saying hi and had to explain myself in my rudimentary french (and figure out why im being singled out in the first place)
Now am back home and still always greet the driver
Surogat (The substitute) is as far as I know the only croatian movie/ cartoon that won an Oscar
I would highly recommend you watch it, it's acutally kind of "deep".
[They don't speak at all, so anyone can watch it
Also, it's quite short, only 10 minutes
I recommend [Čudesna šuma] one of my favourites while growing up
Its a awsome cartoon it was translated in croatian
A je to is one of my all time favourite
Still have dvds of it
if I go to Bosnia and say "Burek sa sirom"
Bulja ( sleng ) means head in Croatia, but ass in Serbia
A lot of our swears have "fucking" included, so if you say "Jebem te u bulju" you'll say "I'm fucking you in your head" in Croatian, but "I'm fuckin' you in the ass" in Serbian
Stupid example, but  "okrenuti" (to turn around) means something different in Montenegrin than it does in Croatian
In Montenegrin in means "to dial" or call (like how you would have to turn the dial wheel around on those old phones) while in Croatian is a slang meaning to fuck someone
&#x200B;
You can imagine my Montenigrin friend getting some very upset reactions from Croatian girls when he asked for a number so he can "turn them around".
Also in Bulgarian "karam" means "I am driving" whereas in Serbo-Croatian it means "I am fucking".
This guy even made a song regarding this translation issue
Hladno piće? Cold drink
Hladna pička would be like a disinterested chick (acting cold)
Hladna pića* - cold beverage in Serbo-Croatian but hungry pussy in Czech and Slovak
Something is off lol
Pička and piće are quite diff but I can only speak for my own language
I know like three people that have a beard (and one of them is a celebrity)
I wouldn't say it is popular, but it isn't unusual to see beards either
I would say that a stubble is much more common to see than a full grown beard
Especially the really long ones, no one has that
But moustaches were popular in some region like 50 years ago
I know that surgeons most of the times are not allowed to have a beard
Is it a problem for veterinary worker aswell do you need to have something to cover or are there no problems at all
Well, we usually suck at qualifying and surprise at the msin tournaments
Passing the group is expected, everything else is a bonus, especially with our current form and game
Not so good
Our manager is so poor in replacing retired players with new generation of kids
We have good players, but the manager is just doing bad job
On the other hand, we ended up woth world silver last time with no game and maybe 1 and a half good match played
Portuguese, i like the specific  expressiveness mixed with the calm of the language
Hebrew, (European) Spanish and for some weird reason, Latvian
Outside or inside of my own, the answer is the same
I really don't like hearing croatian when i go somewhere
I didn't travel to another country to hang out with croats, i can do that back home
The answer would probably be icelandic and maybe french for women because it sounds really sexy
Also serbian, i like women speaking serbian
Napoleon in Croatia is viewed very positively, at least in Dalmatia
His generals built roads, schools and the French published the first Croatian newspaper in Zadar (even though it was bilingual and in Italian as well)
The main shopping street in old town Split is even named after a general, August Marmont
Josip Broz Tito is badly viewed in Croatia and Serbia but the Bosnians think he was a good man the other ex yugoslav countries are neutral of him
Sometimes I feel whenever we answer questions like these, we raise everything to another level
Rest of the world: Yeah, we had some minor skirmishes and fought over this regions/resource, it was horrible, hope it never happens again
Balkan: Hold my rakia
It's same for us for yours Lajos Kossuth and Khuen Hedervary
They're positively viewed in Hungary but are viewed as oppressive tyrants in Croatia
Thank god everything is left in history now and we're not as bitter towards you as we were 150 years ago :)
Funny, there is also a story that a saying exists from 30 years war that goes along these lines "God save us from plague, famine and Croats", according to some it was engraved somewhere in Aachen after the sacking of Magdeburg
I can't remember the details at the moment but hungary, if I remember correctly, wanted Croatia to become hungary
They pushed for hungarian as a necessary language in school, on street signs and on buildings
There was more stuff like that just trying to make us hungarians
Hedervary was more extreme in this than Kossuth as far as I remember but if you want I can go look through my papers to see what exactly they did, or someone who knows the details can correct me
Aside from technical jargon, english is not really used in everyday talk (even if english words are introduced, they are "croatized" and adapted eg we created frend for male and frendica as female friend from original english unisex friend)
Literature goes on in croatian, everyday communication goes on
Life goes on
I am more worried about regional (and subregional) accents and dialects
Yes, Croatian is already dying out and I believe that it will be replaced by English or that it will be heavily Anglicized
if serbocroatian does dissapear it will be because of decresing populations and the fact some immigrants dont teach their children to speak serbocroatiam not becuse of english
They're very forgotten, but I wouldn't expect them to be very known because next to nothing is known about them
I realized it's related to our "Bećar", a traditional Slavonian archetype of someone who is cheery and goes around pubs a lot (often, but not necessarily unmarried)
I find the migrant crisis to be one of the worst things that has happened to Europe
Not so much because of the migrants but due to the rapid rise of right-wing populism and to be honest, it worries me quite a lot
It's true for both
I read somewhere that Heavy speaks/uses words that are pretty formal and eloquent, so that's pretty nice, since he's always portrayed as an idiot
And another fun fact, I'm pretty sure they gave Spy a parisian accent in the french dub, to kinda emphasise his snobishness
1 in the capital and in the other 3 big cities there are those small centres with furniture so when you order it doesn't have to come from Zagreb
One in Zagreb
1 in Zagreb
And I think a couple in Hungary
1 for Croatia
1 ikea store in capital city
Only 1 in Zagreb
Balkan, definetly Balkan here in eastern Croatia(Slavonia)
Other parts of Croatia differ, as northern Croats are very much central Europe and Dalmatians are southern
West Croats I would say they are central as well
Then again you have parts of middle Croatia that I would put in Balkan
So I would say we are Central-Southern Europe and Balkan
In Croatia we were taught in primary school geography that Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltics were Northern Europe
East for us begins at Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine
Hey
You're as Balkan as everybody
(However, for the tiny price of calling Croatia Central Europe
Well that would make Croatia and Bosnia central Europe
He's joking, Montenegro is obviously a part of northern Africa
... Yugoslavia established the Non-aligned movement
It wasn't part of either side
Let's make it a century of rule, and the bureks are out
Always
> In Romania it is considered rude to ask your guest to take them off
Same in Croatia
It also kind of depends how good do you know the person
The less you know the person, the less chance that the guest will be asked to take off their shoes
(I just want to note that I'm speaking from my experience
Probably "U boj, boj":
i don't think i know anyone who knows the lyircs from this song
i know that this is the first time i hear it mentioned somewhere outside of school and first time i'm hearing it
but i guess i'll take this one over thompson any day
>mein Vaterland muss größer sein
No, it shouldn't you mfing warmonger
It's the year 2452
Most of the world was destroyed and became uninhabitable except the British Isles
The continent is swarming with radioactive monsters, but our country constantly sends someone to the continent
Nobody knows why, not even those who send them
All we know is that it became a tradition before the destruction
I would disagree, Slavonia is similar to Vojvodina, but different from the rest of Serbia (as is Vojvodina(. Montenegro si similar to Dalmatia but different from the rest of Croatia
Bosnia is just a mess but culturally I don't feel any connection with it, especially not as I am Zagorje born and Istria raised
Can you be more christian than italy
I know when my sister played volleyball there and i went to pick her up she warned me that under no circumstances i was to say "porco dio" even as a joke because you italians dont porco your dio and people might get angry
Isto
Astronomical taxes, rising crime and Denmark
A lot of Pizza and Kebab
Also if its foreign the mighty Ćevapi
Cevapi are roasted minced meat "fingers" put in a lepinja (like a flat bread) often served with onions and ajvar
I personally really enjoy them and my favourite Cevapi place is Hrga grill
Ajvar is a hot sauce
*Rakije, rakije amo jer utjehe nema u vodi
"[Bring] [rakija] rakija over here, for there is no solace in water
A pretty popular one would be “Čovječe, pazi da ne ideš malen ispod zvijezda
” Meaning “Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man
” It sounds so much better in Croatian, I must say
It’s from a poem Opomena (“Warning”) by Antun Branko Šimić.
I never would’ve guessed that we would build a rivalry with England
Are there any more odd rivalries like that
Pretty excited for our group
Hopefully serbia qualifies, that will make the group even more interesting
And hopefully not too many die in the fights in and around the stadium
Don’t worry you won’t come first
I'm getting real tired of playing against you
Something something costa rica in 2014 WC
I dont think it has a name
Im not sure what i would call it
But its almost never used so
Sounds like a slovenian thing because i've been ordering without onions since i can remember and nobody ever asked me this
I mean i heard the joke a long time ago but not from a kebabist
kebab maker
Kebab dude
april Anno Domini 1776 some serf known as Jakob Verček was carrrying water in a bucket around the city of Varaždin
As he had a bad toothache, he was smoking a cigarette thinking it would help him
The bucket he took was previously used to feed pigs
One of the pigs saw the bucket and started chasing Jakub
Jakub ran to the local barn and jumped in the hay trying to escape
Cigarette fell into the hay, half of the city burned, and the capital had to be moved
It was moved to Zagreb (yea, not Dubrovnik as many of my American friends would think)
The previous capital was Varaždin
It, unfortinately, burned down in a fire and the capital moved to Zagreb
Varaždin was later completly rebuilt in the barouqe style, and it is now famous because of that
Yeah and they planned on moving it back but I guess they never bothered and Zagreb is definitely in a better location unlike Dubrovnik lmao
Dubrovnik as an independent city-state at a time
Republic of Ragusa ceased to exist in 1808 after Napoleon joined it's administative territory with dalmatian
This is how Dubrovnik was united with Croatia
Edit: Dubrovnik was also a first country to recognize US indepedence
Kind of weird because we used to live together for a long time
You can say:
- *Boli me kurac - My dick hurts*
- *Boli me Briga - My worries hurt*
- *(Ne) Briga me - I worry (not is implied)*
- *Ma zaboli me - It hurts me*
- *Boli me dupe - My butt hurts*
- *Jebe mi se - I feel like fucking*
- *Svejedno mi je - It's all the same to me*
And now you can play with those phrases and their word order or add stuff to it
all in all, quite a few options to say I don't care without saying the exact words
briga me = sarcastic "i care"
nije me briga = i dont care (no sarcasm)
boli me kurac = my dick hurts
moš' mislit = im not sure this is even translateable
"lest you entertain the thought"? literally it is "(you) may think"
jebe mi se = "(this) makes me wanna fuck
In Croatian, we have "Zaboli me" which roughly translates to "It hurts me". It's basically a more vulgar way of saying "I don't care".
"Boli me kurac" or "Boli me kita" Both mean "My [reproductive organ] hurts
Kurac is pp, kita is vagane, both vulgar
That's because we don't care how we say it ;)
"mi" means "to me" and "se" is a form of the word "is".
The literally translation is: "Fucks to me""
Edit: You can put any verb instead of "jebe" on that place and it will translate to the: "I feel like *insert the verb*"
Example:
- *Radi mi se - I feel like working*
- *Spava mi se - I feel like sleeping*
- *Trči mi se - I feel like running
... etc
People might not know this but Dubrovnik, Croatia was actually Kings Landing from the popular tv show called Game of Seats or something like that
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think we had the longest European continuous lasting state/country entity from (before) 835
until 1918
going by the name Duchy, later Kingdom of Croatia
We're one of the leading countries in the world regarding organ transplants
Croatia is number one in kidney transplants
We have the world’s smallest town
Croatia also has the highest number of UNESCO Intangible Goods of any European country together with Spain
We also gave you a place to film GoT, Star Wars, and many other movies and TV shows, the tie, torpedo, mechanical pencil, fingerprinting, rice chocolate, the Dalmatian and the Croatian shepherd
You’re welcome
Biggest neandertal findings are in a place called Krapina
Smallest town on earth is called Hum (less then 20 population)
Longest fortification system in the world after the Chinese Great wall is in Ston
(5,5 km long)
Oldest city in Europe is in Croatia
People enhibited the city of Vinkovci for 8000 years
(It was probably not called that through it's whole history
I'm pretty confused right now
Until the last photo from the dude who replied below
Heh
Croatia too
I mean, same here
I'm not really sure about that
Any proof
For chicago to be "polish" city in its loose sense it needs to have polish majority
What you meant to say is the city with highest population of poles after warsaw
In Croatia too

Decameron suits the current situation the best
Yes because Serbia is not and will not be in NATO
Are we ignoring the fact of Milosevic war crimes in Kosovo
>Western countries didn't care about the lack of universal support for the declaration of independence and still accepted it
Your country was one of the first to recongize Kosovo
Spain is a unitary country and some random region can't just decide to opt out of the country because they don't like paying taxes
It's not like it's a case of ethnic oppression, ethnic Catalans are a minority in Catalonia due to decades of migration from other regions of Spain, it's just a case of uppity rich people not wanting to give money to the rest of the country
And also it's not even clear that there's a majority support for independence in the first place since all the people against independence didn't vote as they agreed with the government stance that the vote is illegitimate
Turnout was only 43% on the last referendum
Because other comment explained they dont want to lose big allies if they support Catalonia they lose spain
It's dumb to talk about it as if it's some foreign thing that has nothing to do with you
Germans and French: "Thanks, we'll pass this time
Signorina was actually lent into Croatian (in Dalmatia) with the same meaning and it's still used among older population just meaning Miss, younger woman, when refering to a stranger
So I guess Croatians coming to Italy like to flex their knowledge of Italian which actually just constitutes of all the Italian loanwords in Dalmatian dialect
*trying to fit in*
How do you do, fellow cunts
There isn't really a specific pattern
Only thing that happens a lot is that people get nicknames based on their surname rather than their name
Not me tho :(
My god, such a badass language and badass names
Worth mentioning that we usually (at least in my experience) use surnames to create nicknames
I know a bunch of people named Dugi, Mrki, Crni, etc
just because they have similar surnames
Also, those are all male names, women usually don't get a nickname via their surname, don't know why tho
To give you an example, Modrić would be Modri, Šuker would be Šuki, etc
But at the same time Davor Šuker could be Dado, there are no rules in choosing between the name or the surname, it just depends what the kids start using when you're young and that one usually sticks
Sweet, means my family will be forced to start using other shit to communicate online with me and i never have to use facebook ever again
Call their bluff
Oh no whatever will we do
YES PLEASE
oh god yes please
please make facebook leave forever
what's wrong with facebook
Now we need for Twitter to do the same
Nice
This and Twitter, maybe reddit is next
Mesanger is only reason I didnt deleted my account already
Lol exactly
Nobody really uses FB that much anymore
I would love it if Europeans made their own version, where privacy would actually mean something
Seriously FB can fuck off
You are not much better, UK
I love when I argue with republicans /Democrats on the Internet, trying to explain to them that Conservative /Liberal is not the only way to differ parties, and then they all go sWeEtIe, uR wRoNg, i hAvE fAcTs while theyre just a bunch of 16 year olds like go away and Learn that Europe isn't a country
This is the gravest insult to the czechs i have ever witnessed
Oh look
GERMAN HUMOUR
Basically: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it
" Great show of statesmanship
Personally, I think these cartoons are insulting and that, as a society, we should see than as a negative thing
However, we should always give people the right to do these things, because if you take it away who gets to decide what can and can't be criticizes and satirized
So while I am against the cartoons, i don't think things like that should be banned
I completely agree with what he said and it is really common sense
But this argument is also something that can be used by shitty people that want (e.g.) Nazi stuff in public
In France, it is illegal to display Nazi flags, uniforms and insignia in public, unless for the purpose of a historical film, show, filmmaking or spectacle
Not sure I completely understand the resolution, what does it exactly standardize
The port on the mobile phones
The port on the outlet / charger
Charging standard (USB-PD / DASH charge / etc)

Such comments and speculations should be avoided, especially if they clearly violate our rules
Thanks for being voice of reason
It's horrible enough that we are losing one of architectural and history jewels of Europe right in front of our eyes
I am pretty emotional here too
It survived eight centuries only for our generation to see it burn
I cannot help but feel a bit of guilt and responsibility
But playing the blame game with knowing very little facts is just going to deepen the hate and division
We'll find out what happened eventually
Now let's just hope everyone makes it out alive and unharmed
And they can save as much as possible
The roof and interior were mostly wood
~~Not sure, but it seems that its only the "attic" area that is on fire for now
Catastrophic in either case
Edit: Apparently the fall of the spire spread the fire to the entire interior
Yeah, it took me by surprise too
800+ years of skill, vision and architectural prowess of human race, up in smoke, and some nimrods are laughing about it

Seems the further away you were from the Soviets and Ottomans the better things worked out
I mean, yes but Balkans also sometimes beat the west in some things too
For some reason "worrying results" sounds much worse than "bad results" to me
Some things that nobody wants to be the best at
What about quality of life
Unfortunately we don't beat them in that
Afaik, they haven't really changed their mind
The polls are again showing very narrow margins
The problem is that if the new referendum goes like this the losing side cam ask for another one with equal right

Fear the Belarus pan
That would make Swedes the majority
I mean, the restaurants sell food
The US government sent grain shipments to the USSR simply because it was the right thing to do (and it was a propaganda win) so I genuinely don't see the issue here
Even though they somehow morphed into a quasi symbol of US style capitalism, they're a restaurant
They sell food
It's not exactly a political statement
This isn't a tech company helping a totalitarian regime or even a clothing company using their cheap labor
It's just a restaurant
Their food isn't healthy, but it's safe
McDonalds has standards that in my experience don't change from country to county and provides a consistent product that, while not as cheap elsewhere as it is in the US, is still decent and affordable
You can fault them for a lot of things, but opening up locations in places where people could realllly use some comfort food is absolutely not one of them
In the US, not in in the USSR
Real Estate is a cornerstone of their business but it's not as big outside the States and virtually nonexistent in the East block
They were and still are just a restaurant there
Im proud of this comunity

When the smoking ban hit our country, some tv reporters found a surgeon on a smoking break in the hospital general area
And when they confronted him he said:

That shut them up
Seems like Europe as a whole is turning into a shit hole
I'm from Eastern Europe and it's been a shit hole for a long as I remember (minus the ladies )
Ukraine/Russia issue, France revelation, Hungary, immigrants flooding bos/serb, it ain't looking good
It seems like Poland will be the only remaining country that has its shit together
Good ole' gerrymandering, the official voting system of the GOP since 1854
Donald Dumb:
>“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr
John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true
— but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought
— but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible
I love how Trump is making me love my Europeans even more
First it was Sweden, now Denmark
Fairly sure this guys thick boneheaded attitude is the only thing that could fix the relations of countries in the Balkans

r/russia is a pro-Putin sub
I think one should be careful to consider it as representative of Russia
Elections are rigged, but even people that voted for Putin could detest the injustice and assassination threat that Navalny is facing
Reddit is so quick and easy to jump to conclussions
A single person posts this photo on which it (perfectly undisputably) *seems* that another individual is doing the Nazi salute, proceeds to with certainty label it as what the title is, and **literally everybody** jumps on the bandwagon
This is just bullshit lol
You are a patriot when you fight for your country
I doubt that this guy or majority of this sub would do that
Bist du retarded
He looks retard af
Reddit is conservative as hell
They/we are praising USA/capitalism that killed more than 400 milion
There is a theory that Britain killed more than billion people in India with capitalism
You don't know it's true, it's a lie to claim that
Prejudices and presumptiveness are just that
Please look at my flair
It disgusts me hearing people talk about how great our Nazi collaborators were
Buncha dumb fucks
>It's the anxiety, frustration, lack of opportunities and defeatist attitude that pushes them into these radical beliefs, inceldom or similar and all as a result of the way modernization changed human interaction for the worse
What's worse is that people make fun of them and degrade them, insult them which in turn makes them hunker down on their beliefs, makes them blind to their ideology and makes them hostile to the rest of the community
Same thing with criminals, if no one wants to hire them and give them a chance they will most likely return to crime because they don't have other options
Some will turn a new leaf but for others it's too hard

It probably helps that people who are voting nowadays are now a lot more aware of all the bullshit fake russian bots who keep spreading false information to get people like Le Pen in power to weaken the west
Doesn't even need to be especially high speed
Just cheap and comfortable
Have a few hubs that the bullet trains ride between, have nice, big comfortable, but not especially fast trains that that connect the countryside with the hubs
Make it as easy as possible to transport large amount of luggage, both on the train, but also, when switching between trains by offering baggage trolleys
Make buying tickets via app quick and easy
Have a standardized system of using colored stripes on the floor where each color always corresponds to the same Platform number (1 is always red, 2 is always blue) and make the number and color very obvious on the ticket
In my experience, price and ease of travel frequently outweigh speed when considering the mode of transportation
It has improved for me
I mean
personally
for me it stayed the same
it's not like I was surprised by your president
Croatian: Worsened (because of the "black lives matter" riots, not the covid-19 situation)
That is not multiculturalism, tho, it is multilateral international action
Also all these people are westerners and as such have a lot in common
There isnt a huge difference between Dutch and Canadian culture
Cooperating despite differences is a lot harder when cultures are very different from each other and it introduces problems that didnt exist before
Whatever good is created has to be greater than those negatives in order to be justified and I dont see much extra value being produced by multiculturalism of the kind we see in UK, France, Belgium
You lose some social cohesion, have to have arguments about free speech, secularism, womens rights and gay rights all over again and for what
Better choice of restaurants
More exotic entertainment
Meeting interesting people
Not to mention that dealing with negative aspects of multiculturalism sucks out the oxygen from public discourse from other topics society needs to address
Seems like a bad deal
I wouldn't rejoice, his opposition is Serbian nationalists
Lmao Croatian party got like 0,1%
That's a bit morbid

I would genuinely like if this idea got more traction, so I'll share wherever I can
The optimal solution for Scotland in the short term is to demand the N. Ireland deal
Both N. Ireland and Scotland voted to stay in the EU and Scotland had previously voted to stay in the UK
The deal effectively has it both ways
If then Scotland decides to vote for independence, the N. Ireland deal is the best transitory state before leaving the UK
If however, Scotland votes to stay again, it would still maintain access to the EU market and many of the rights enjoyed by EU citizens
Let the places that wanted to leave, fully leave, but as it's obviously possible to have it both ways, I see no reason why Scotland should be put in a worse position than N. ireland
We're gonnae miss you
Nobody leaving lights for N. Ireland though
The EU didn't do this tho
It was some Scottish party
Yes
It's exceptionally easy and seamless
They can do it electronically
Your own government said as much
No matter the individual, pepper spraying them is not right when it wasn't the right thing to do (and there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for the officer to have sprayed her), regardless of what they do for a living
It's silly to me that she came to a protest flaunting her credentials though
Like, really silly, what did she expect

why u made one

UK is testing close to 10,000 every day if you have symptoms - I think they're doing well
Also Italy seems to be pretty on top of testing now
Somebody hasn't checked the news lately
You can also just google 'UK to test 10,000 people per day'.
They haven't been testing 10,000 every day for long, just since the last few days
Still, they've tested the second most in Europe (behind Italy) and have tested more per capita than the majority of European countries (I think they're 4th or 5th for that)
The UK strategy also isn't to get 60% of the people infected, that's just something that keeps getting bandied around the subreddit
Bruh why is this on r/europe lmao

I don't want my son living in hell 50 years from now
Not being in denial of it is already a massive step in the right direction
For the clueless: Our President and our PM are from opposing political parties
Our President, Milanović, is from Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is centre-left, and our PM, Plenkoivić, is from the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which is centre-right
I  have a couple of Slovenian friends, lately all I see from their timelines is them commenting on Janša's pictures to piss off and that he's a conman lol
That's absolutely true, but it is still a lot nearer to a solution than outright denying the science
There is some kind of a chance now
I'm talking about my son, who exists, not a metaphor for the future
I mean yeah, I'll probably live to see some shit too, but I'll be on my way out by then, he will be in what are supposed to be his best years

I've seen enough of these around too :)
OK, I agree there
I misspoke if I left that impression
Its not funny mocking a disabled person
at the time I was working in the middle east for a major IT corporation from the USA, 90%+ of employees that were muslims were actually supportive and/or with the what did they expect (approving tone) attitude for those killings
Those were thoughts of a highly educated/moderate muslims working for western company
What is bullshit
Their thinking or my writeup
I was living 10 years in the middle east and my sources are muslim colleagues / friends / strangers that directly shared their thoughts with me + semi regular lecturing about the world that should be lived and experienced as quran dictates
Damn this must be at least 50+ k
what kind of flags are those
It's just not gonna end well, Russia's influence there is too high and the country it self has next to no allies, it's pretty much free real a state for Putin to use any excuse, even the weakest to take the country when Lukashenko completely fails to hold onto his power
This might be a far worse situation than even Ukraine, it won't just be a part that'll be occupied but the whole country will be possibly likely taken
EU will just do it's usual sanction thing,write an angry letter and then do not much else while US will do nothing at all due to the current president
Wow, this surely must be the end of Lukashenko
This simply can not be ignored

Why would you ever aim for 50/50
If you want to remove gender bias by blanking out names or other means, that's perfectly fine
If you want to create a quantifiable test that eliminates subjectivity, that's fine too
If you however decide to force equality in any unequal field you will be denying more qualified candidates because they don't fir in to a specific demographic, aka one of the big reason people didn't like the concept of aristocracy, because what you're born as was more important than what you could do
It's not only terribly unfair, it's outright stupid for the exact same reason flat out stopping women from doing certain jobs was stupid
/r/europe has posts on top of r/all all the time, this is nothing new

It kinda distorts the line between Nazis and those that claim to be anti-nazis, both go after violence and it's just a never ending circle of fighting, Germany has laws against such things, it should be left to the authorities to sanction the guy
IDK maybe he was ignorant about the differences between US and German laws when it comes to expressing yourself joke or not

There is a Stalinist party
In Croatia we've got two, always one of them wins and then there's smaller parties who just get absorbed and do drama if possible (eg one party not getting enough votes and all so then mini parties go all patriotic and shit just to turn out to be a bunch of money hungry retards who do complete opposite of they promised the people to do etc, we even had one "new" party one elections, upon realizing they have actual chance to influence the outcome of elections their dumbfuck leader went to sign a public document stating they aren't going to be bought by croatian democratic party and that they will do everything that interests Croatia as a country only, to form a government with said party a week later, the same government that turned out to be the most embarrassing group of retards Croatia has ever saw, and trust me, we get out yearly dose of retards in bulk)

What are the needed reforms that this proposal addresses

Thrilling game, Croatia played really well for one part of the game, France really well for the other part of the game, and in the end they won fair and square
I'm glad for France, but I'm also glad for us
Just look at the unity it brought to us, as well as the world's spotlight on us
It's fantastic
The prize REALLY IS the friends we made along the way
Because almost all of the Frances top players are from Africa and all Croatias players are true Croats
Still it was a great game but I think that first foul on Griezman should not have been called :/

This is why the world prays for him not to get re-elected
When it comes to domestic policies, that's America's issue
But just try to picture how much of a mess he can cause on a global scale, and this insane, greedy behavior is what we all fear
He doesn't care about how bad the pandemic is, how many people will die, or how many world countries will suffer socioeconomicallly from the outbreak
He only cares about himself and how much he can profit from this
I recall one of his presidential rallies when he said, and I quote: "The world is laughing at us, folks
But they won't laugh no more
" In a way, he was right: We were laughing at the idea of the sheer insanity that he could possibly become President
But we aren't laughing anymore
We are afraid
Afraid of how many innocent people just trying to live their lives and having no connection to him, or the US, that would suffer if this happened
It's not funny anymore
And then the police stormed in and arrested at least a hundered of them
pretty much the same thing happened with japan
china put some war criminals to trial and then america made all that stop because they needed an ally in the pacific because the cold war started
and now even to this day it's pretty much political suicide for any japanese politician to condemn or even acknowledge japanese war crimes
they even have shrines for their "heroes" and pm's pay homage there
like some of the guys that were meant to be put on trial were in the same category of prisoner as the nazi top brass
it's kinda fucked that only germany made a solid effort to de-nazify and every other axis power large or small just kinda slipped by under the radar with minimal changes, even keeping a lot of the same people in power

On this day 80 years ago Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
That's why today we mark the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
It is also known in some countries as *Black Ribbon Day*.
Why is it called Stalinism
I thought it was just Communism
Or did Stalin do something special
( Is it just the sending of people to the Gulag
TIL Nazi Germany had non-aggresion pacts with dozen countries including Poland and Czechoslovakia
The USSR was actually the last country to sign it, also USSR wanted to form anti-Hitler pact in the early 30s but western european countries refused that
In some countries the day is actually commemorated as The European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of All Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes
I guess the EP didn't want to anger the leftists so they left out the word communism
I agree with your point but I wanted to post the official name in the title, not my own
Because they had to spread revolution across the  whole world which isnt really easy
That's right, also in [Slovenia] and [Croatia]
Northern Croatia was hit by a 5

I froze in my bed, I was scared shitless
Heard my someone screaming my name and I didn't move until it was done
I have no idea what to say
Whoever is writing the script for 2020 can kindly fuck off
I've experienced a few quakes but this was something else, motherfucker moved the *furniture*!
I just felt a new one in Varaždin, weaker, but it rocked the building
I woke up to my room violently shaking and everything falling down around me
I hope this is it and not a foreshock
Our building shook so fucking hard, it was literally going like 10 degrees in every direction
Only good thing about this is that I tested my reflexes
I managed to wake my SO, grab the dog and cat, run out and on the way check for damages
&#x200B;
But yeah, this sucks
Meteor, Corona and now earthquake
I'm betting on aliens next
I overslept thinking it was a dream
THE END IS NEAR
And now a third
I was never so scared in my life
Great, now they're gonna keep rebuilding it for another 100 years
It was actually 5
5, that's what our own institute has measured
I just start eating my burek and than this shit happened
Im just happy that my family is ok and hause is still ok as well but lots of people lost their home today
lucy us that this was only 5
5 strong
TUDUDUDUDU, NEMA NAM POMOCIIIIII
I was at the border of the earthquake so I just felt it a little bit
The most damage by me is some broken glass that fell of the shelfs
When I first heard the glass break I was so scared I thought someone broke into my house
In the moment when eartquake hit, my only thought was “ok
this is the end”
Da ja zivim u Zagrebu i ovo je jako, jako lose
Women’s hospital was badly hit
Mothers in their night dresses and slippers where outside holding their newborns
Women that have to have birth were put in the cars
Tfw you live in Split and it could probably also hit here since the effects of the earthquake are spreading
Yes they say that one stronger earthquake will come in an hour
Ljudi pazite se
I felt it in Varaždin
Whole fucking building moving under my feet
At least we're not bored, eh
Yeah, old buildings are the biggest problem
Newer ones (even after WWII) didn't sustain damage
We had 5 years of war, so we will be fine, but fuck my luck
Born in communism, 5 years of war in 1990's, great depression, covid19 pandemic and now earthquake

Meanwhile, that sanctimonious bitch had a shotgun wedding because she got knocked up
Hypocritical cow
Outside and fricking cold
Temperature dropped to 4°C from yesterday's ~20°C.
I just hope these people never experience serious damage
Many dead, tens of thousands with no place to live
Strongest one in 140 years
wtf is your problem
Same here in Varaždin
EDIT:: second one is 5
0, first was 5
You can see some scaffolding in the picture ... Zagreb started to repair buildings lately, but there are still a lot that are in pretty bad shape
Jeeej
And another
0 for the second as reported on jutarnji
Yeah man i wish it stayed warm
Pa no, na kraju dana, ono sto zaista ubije covjeka je dosada
Well that's kinda weird, in my dream some guy or girl said (most probably guy) quote: "My least favorite part about it
is the earthquake hallucinations" or something like that
So when I woke up I legit thought I was still dreaming
Maybe it's like a coping mechanism for the shock of the experience beforehand

When Germany invaded Soviet Union, Soviets practically didn't have anything
Germans destroyed most of the Soviet air-force, infantry and tanks didn't have ammunition, there was no food, trucks, etc
Soviet also had fuel shortage after they destroyed oil fields in Caucasus region
With Lend Lease the got massive amount of materials from airplanes and ammunition to locomotives, wagons and food which help them to hold back Germans and reorganized
Soviets had huge losses because civilians died working in inhuman conditions the Ural Mountains and generals having same tactic, rush with huge amount of troops
Don't forget that commissars shoot any retreating soldier
The Soviet Union created another 50 years or dictatorship and economic hardship while the US and the UK brought freedom, democracy and capitalism to Western Europe crating the most peaceful time in human history
The USSR could have defeated Germany on their own
It would have taken 3 more years and cost millions more lives
Europe would fall into a communist dictatorship likely lasting longer than in out world
And the US could have defeated Germany on their own
It would have also lasted 3 more years and cost millions more lives
The Marshall plan would never have been implemented and Europe would experience a massive economic depression and would likely never recover
It sure isn't UK

Now imagine that nobody cares, because these aren't rich people cars, they're just cars and the owner of the Porsche doesn't feel like driving so they decide to take their bike or even the tram to work
You just lose any and all sense of perspective of what it means to be rich

Hey, i have a question
12 years ago i met few estonian dudes who taught me some swear phrases i still remember
I dont know how to write them tho because i know nothing about estonian (eesti
Is that correct
Also, mind you, i'm croatian so i'll just type it as it sounds
The first one is basic "asshole" and it should be "berzeuk".
The second one is something i didnt understand but they said it's basic estonian insult and it goes something like this: "tura lic era pilu minuga e maxa norida".
The third one is on my request and it should mean "i piss on your mother's grave". It's "kushen su ema hauale".
Also, i have no idea how i still remember all of those
Well, that sounds about right
Thanks man
Now i can properly insult an estonian
Perseauk
But how can the second one be translated into so many words
Can you break it down for me please
Lol what
Thanks man
If i only knew i'd learn more phrases
Wow, crazy
Thanks for the explaination
You said none of them are used actually but you must be using "tura lits" if nothing else, right
You are, without doubt, a part of the worst thing about England
You're part of the dregs of English society
Nobody in the UK cares that Ireland didn't take an active role - it didn't stop many Irish people from joining British armed forces either
Similarly, the Irish are well aware of their neutrality - but you can't really blame them
Besides, plenty of countries remained neutral during the war
It begs the question, what on earth did you think you were doing when you took the time to write that comment
What exactly did you think it would achieve
Sure, Ireland was neutral - I never refuted that
But everything else you've said is assumptive
Secondly, Ireland is a victim of history - just because they chose not to act doesn't make them less of one
Perhaps, if they were treated better by the UK they wouldn't have had the political environment that generated a movement towards neutrality

Honest question for Latvians and Estonians, considering that more than every fourth person in your country is Russian, how do they react to anti-Russian climate and political decisions
Don't get me wrong, I am fully supporting you against them, but I am just wondering if the Russian minority is loud against such decisions or if they are more loyal to their "new"  homelands
This list is longer and longer is it problem in this countries or in some people in kremlin

So, does this cover Google Maps navigation
Google (even in the background) collects tons of data about road conditions, individual driving habits, predicts future conditions and it can suggest or divert the drivers to a less congested route
Considering how many drivers use Google maps and Waze for turn-by-turn navigation, can it be considered "manipulating human behavior using AI" if it tries to decongest the traffic by rerouting a large amount of people
For anyone wondering, this is the spot

I'm fine with this redesign [i'm also currently living in Finland so this post is perfect]
It's like after watching that one ted talk, everyone is an expert on flag design
The whole "draw by hand" thing is not a hard rule but a rule of thumb and a very subjective one at that
For example, Kiribati that someone linked here as an example of a too complicated flag, looks awesome, who cares if a child can't draw it
Kids are crappy artists and if you stick to what they can draw you end up with variations on "3 parallel lines" or "Cross on a background" that don't look unique at all
We also have a shit ton of them aswell
I’ve seen a few in Canada, pretty cool
My guess is that Montana is full of them

Btw, does anyone have any sort of data on how much money each country will get
Btw, Croatia , as a result, was given two times more money for the period of 2021-2027, than 2013-2020
The amount of the money we got (22 billion€) covers about 35% of our GDP, or 40% of our GDP for 2020 (if we consider that it will fall by 10%)
So I'd say that I'm pretty much pleased with the results, I Know where a part of that money will go, but I'm also glad that we were given that amount
If you knew anything about Austrian banks in ex-Yugoslav countries you wouldn't say this .... hint, they were corrupt as fuck, just check Hypo Alpe Adria case

Well like half of the population of Croatia has either emigrated to Ireland or is planning to, so yes, Ireland is Balkan
The UK was always just Yugoslavia with money
The English are the Serbs, the Irish are the Bosnians, the Scots are the Croatians, the Welsh are the Slovenians and Cornwall is Macedonia
As to why
1) delusions of grandeur
2) split down religious and ethnic lines
3) just awesome people in general
4) have a language that everyone else kind of understands but not really
5) is always forgotten
I find this scenario very plausible
Belka is more likely the white one
Wrong for Croatia, I never heard someone say that
We usually refer to Chinese
Spansko selo
In croatia ive never heard spanish used in this context
Ive heard hungarian, french, turkish or chinese, but never spanish
Never ever heard anyone in Croatia refer to something they don't understand as "Spanish".
The closest I've ever heard along those lines was  "Kao da čitam Kineski" (As if I were reading Chinese) or just simply "Ma, Kineski" (Bah, Chinese)
In my area we often say it (Primorsko goranska)
Oh that's cool
I'm from Slavonija and we don't say that here
As a fellow Slavonian I can confirm that I have never ever heard that phrase
Apparently it's Serbia
You only even find mentions of it as "Špansko selo" (Serbian) and never "Španjolsko selo" (Croatian)
Podravina and Zagreb, never heard of someone saying "špansko selo" in that sense
Either Chinese or Turkish, even Hungarian is more often
There are Christian in Iceland

Zlatni rat beach in Croatia, before and after the latest storm in Dalmatia
>Is this normal

>**The Zlatni Rat, often referred to as the Golden Cape or Golden Horn (translated from the local Chakavian dialect)**, is a spit of land located about 2 kilometres (1 mile) west from the harbour town of Bol on the southern coast of the Croatian island of Brač, in the region of Dalmatia
"Rat" means war in Croatian, but in local dialect it has different meaning

I hope we buy Dassault Raffale at the end
It’s been mentioned as a considerable option by media and our defense minister last weeks
Well, I hope we get Grippens because they’re the most suitable for our defence system for they need much shorter track to take off, meaning they can be hidden more easily
But let’s be real, we’re most likely getting F-16, I just hope the newest version

There's just the issue with the term "marriage" being used as the term for the same-sex relationships being embodied in the legal sense
It's not marriage unless it's a man and a woman
leave the bieb out of this
It's not as simple as that
For me it boils down to having some pride over what I am, just as you people expect everyone to bow down in order to respect what gay people are
Marriage is for men and women
Marriage is not between people of the same sex
That's the only issue I have
Equality is not trampling on what holds significance and meaning to another person in order to accomodate yourself
There's plenty of books on the topic of why the kid is "poor" as compared to those who's paternal situation is normal
poor idiots downvoted this
don't do that
don't give me hope /s
I disagree
~~Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
~~ I believe that marriage should be the partnership of a man and a woman because such couples are capable of bearing children
Gay couples cannot do that and thus they cannot have a marriage but a legal partnership requiring a new term, by my current logic
> You people
Straight people
> Bow down
You've just demonastrated my point
Because I am not forfeiting my point from the get-go, or rather, because I even dared to discuss it, you've proclaimed not only me, but **the whole of people of Croatia** to be barbarians (that is what the ending of their (u/mmedepompadour) comment aabove says in Croatian: "zbog ovakvih stvari ljudi misle da su hrvati divljaci")
You can't have a civilised conversation
You start screaming hate unless you're pat on the metaphorical head of the point you're trying to make
> Gay people getting married somehow interferes with your feeling of pride
There's this movement called the "Pride" movement
It's about gay people standing up for their rights
So, with the (strong) assumption that you're supportive of that, why are you denying me to have pride over being straight and wanting to preserve my pride over it
> And marriage is just for straights - says fucking who
Even the Pope knows better
I am just here trying to talk about my point of view, calm down
> Anyway, zbog ovakvih stvari ljudi misle da su Hrvati divljaci
People who are capable of deeming an entire nation worth of people to be barbarians just because of their experience with a few people
I mean, how do you see yourself exactly
To be this abusive towards me for talking about what I think
You are supposedly fighting for gay people while simultanouesly displaying the hate that the very gay people are opressed by; Judgemental, prejudicial hate towards a group of people, which in your case is the people of Croatia
im sad that this is getting downvoted
PR stunt to appease the EU
In reality, the Serbian "Progressive" Party is
Well, progressive in its name is as meaningful as socialism is in the name of the Nazi Party
Look beyond the obvious and it becomes more clear that she's a token LGBTQ politician
In reality, Serbia has a history of extreme violence against homosexuals
I'm Croatian, and it's not like the situation here is much better, but it's quantifiably worse in Serbia: while Croatia held its first Pride parade in 2002 and then onward, it took Serbia until 2014 to hold one successfully (yes, there were a few Pride parades in Serbia, one in 2001 & 2010 in Belgrade, and another in Novi Sad in 2007, but all ended in violence, and the 2010 one was the most infamous one
If you wanna see more on the subject, there is a popular Serbian movie called *Parada* (The Parade) released in 2011
It's a comedy, but it tackles LGBT issues in Serbia
They are a man and a woman
They are not gay because they are a man and a woman the same way a gay couple cannot have a marriage for being a gay couple
> First off, it’s super fucked up to believe that everyone that gets married needs to have “getting kids” as the end goal
You don't make for a good reputation of gay people and their whatever like this
I've only once met an extreme supporter of gay rights who wasn't emotionally unstable
I didn't say that everyone that gets married need to have kids, you made it up and are so blinded by your emotions that you've asserted it as something I've said, when I never did
I did not express myself precisely though, so I'll give you that
The "Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
" part should've been "Marriage is the partnreship which is capable of bearing a family
> Second, I guess my lesbian parents count as married in your eyes, and that’s nice
They aren't your parents
They are your adoptive parents, legal guardians, or whatever the term is in your country
You are statistically likely to be greatly behind in the understanding of the sex missing in your household as one of the parents, which is important for the overall success in life
> it pains me that homophobia is so widespread
Coming from you, my understanding tells me that "homophobia" doesn't really mean homophobia but merely people who don't hold the same view as yourself on the topic
>  I don’t see how it will ever change when people such as yourself claim that giving equal rights to LGBT people means “bowing down” and “losing one’s sense of pride”.
Read again what was said
I didn't say that I need to bow down to "gay people", I said to "you people" meaning people such as yourself who are advocating their rights by throwing hate at anyone whose opinions and stances do not mirror your own
> I hope you’ll realise why this is wrong but I won’t hold my breath
Please, do not hold it
You need plenty of oxygen in your brain in order to realize that next-to-no-one ever agreed with anyone just because the other person thought they are wrong
> What’s the actual reason that the rule has to be “man and woman only”?
This
> Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
should've been this "Marriage is the partnership of two people which are capable of bearing children". And no that doesn't exclude infertile people or the like, but is simply meant to mean all legal acknowledgements of the relationship of a couple consisting of a man and a woman
So again, you aren't living with your parents, you are living with one of your parents
You lied, but are still being derogatory towards me
Just because you dislike something doesn't make it okay to want to ignore that something
> You’re telling me what the rule is, I’m asking you why the rule is
It's not the rule, it's what I think should be the definition
>Why is family the goal
I don't know
I just think that marriage should be the legal relationship of people capable naturally of achieving that goal
And yes, infertile people aren't excluded, the basis is man-woman, the natural thing
>Who decided that
Nature since the first life
> Why should their opinion matter to anyone
Who is they
I'll assume it's you and will say that your opinion should matter to anyone because you presumably live in a society, and you can't live in a society if the other people don't acknowledge your individuality
I mean, what kind of a question is that even
>What if family isn’t my goal with my wife
Nothing, you're still by default most likely capable of it and that's what matters for this
>What if we just want to be happy enjoying our marriage to each other
So be it
Life is long and you might decide on having children one day, you might not
But you could
Gay couples could not
What a mature conversation this has been
Good luck
It's actually just a song reference

God dammit, now you've ruined it
The cost is already too big to pay
The only option UK and France had with Germany was war, and the only real way to stop Russians is war, difference is the disparity of power then and now, and existence of nuclear weapons
Any war against Russia will completely obliterate both sides
Actually if you look at the stockpiles of resources, geographical distribution of population, military assets, and manufacturing capabilities, you'll see that Russia will probably leave any nuclear conflict with an upper hand
With luck and proper use of missile defense and first strikes Russia could only lose as low as 60% of it's population, US and EU lose at minimum 70% of population, EU alone is basically 100% due to the small land area and huge concentration of people
Who could have foreseen it

Croatia uses nuclear energy too, not sure why it can't be seen on the graph
Sweden, muh man
Croatia looks pretty clean
This is a bit confusing
Where do we get all that renewable energy from
And why is there nothing about nuclear energy for croatia
We're sharing the nuclear powerplant Krško with slovenia
Croatian here
You sure this is accurate
We are that good
No way
Hydro energy, Wind energy and Solar energy
Croatia has a lot of it and the potential of even more renewable energy in Croatia is enormous
Well, read the contract better then, because Croatia will need to take care of 50% of waste and bear 50% of decommissioning costs
i know the potential is enormous and i knew we have a couple of hydro power plants but i didn't know about solar and wind, where do we have those
and i didn't know it's such a big part of our total energy consumption
Wind - Pag, Sibenik
Solar - somewhere in northern Adriatic
He is wrong
Croatia has obligation to take care of 50% of nuclear waste (when the plant shuts down)
Turks do be T H I C C

Lol if you just took a picture of any Croatian city (apart from those on the coast) from 2012 and 2020 you wouldn’t see any difference

1) It's the automation that increased productivity, humans aren't pouring coffee or hammering nails any faster than they were 60 years ago
2) If people were willing to live the same lifestyle as 60 years ago, they could work much less
But everyone wants all the gadgets and products that were created in the past 60 years as well so in order to buy extra crap, you need to work more
It's down to choices
If you're willing to scale back consumption and pick what you're going to blow your money on more carefully, you'd have more time off
Most people would rather do something to get more stuff rather than do "leisure". Entire human civilization has been developed in this manner: need food to live, get better at making food
Now some people can stop making food and make some more pots and pans, better tools for everything involved
Now we need even fewer people for that so let's make some beer and build nicer houses so we don't get sick as often and are more productive; use that productivity to make something new and on and on it goes
We could've frozen it at any point and said "we have enough" but then what are you going to do
Sit on a beach drinking colored drinks with little umbrellas
How boring will that be after few weeks
There's nothing stopping you personally from freezing it and not buying new TVs, new phones, new whatever comes next
But you're not going to do that, are you
It's not just the phone, it's the dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, air conditioning, car with AC and better mileage and better safety features, microwave, etc
It's also food imported from all over the world, much more clothes than people 60 years ago had, internet access, computer and tablet, big TV with 300 channels, college education for everyone, health care for everyone, all kind of welfare and social services and on and on it goes
>even if you are a couple with two average incomes you need to really plan and lower your expectations when searching for a home
Yea, cause you're not happy with the kind of house people had 60 years ago, you want a bigger, fancier one, it has to be in the right neighborhood, etc
It has to be a "dream house"
People today have way more than our grandparents did and simultaneously have no sense of gratitude for it but are complaining they have to work for it
It's just silly
Move to a small house and ditch all that tech, use bicycle instead of a car, have 3 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts, eat cheap food and you can life off of one income with no problems
Not surprising, not sure who in their right mind would consider The UK,Russia and USA atm
all that trust worthy considering the leaderships all three countries have currently
> people who are more than happy to defend these assholes
I feel like this applies to myself, so I'll explain why exactly we "defend" these assholes
Every time the EU has attempted to solve these problems - be it the VAT on digital services or the currently-debated copyright directive - I, a person running a SME in the EU got screwed over with the regulation
At the same time, despite all the talk about a single digital market, half of Europe (you guess which half) is constantly treated like a damned hellzone when it comes to access to those same digital services - from the "We do not ship here" to the "no iTunes store for your country" all the way to the "Stripe is not available in your country".
So - here's a crazy suggestion - instead of destroying SME in this insane quest to get at Facebook, Google, etc - how about the EU actually push for a single digital market
Praise the Void
Serious question - how does it all affect the concrete foundation (roof, walls, appartments directly below)

I‘m impressed to see that so many Croats like Ukraine as well
Guess it‘s not just a rumor that we are close friends
Слава Україні and love from Croatia
Happy independence day from Croatia Slavic Brothers️
Oh, happy birthday Ukraine
Croatia is with you ️
Slava Ukrajini
Slava Ukraina
We don't just like Ukraine we like/love all our Slavic Brothers
Mi ne volimo samo Ukrajinu mi volimo svu Slavensku Braću
We are not friends we are BROTHERS
That‘s awesome
I knew that Slavic languages are intelligible to some extent, but never thought of understanding such a high percentage
I listen to Ukrainian music every now and then as a matter of fact, and it‘s around 60% intelligible for me
I am sure that I would also be able to understand a bit more, if it was a little slower spoken
It depends on who you ask I suppose
I like all, but Ukraine has a special place in my heart and as it turns out many other Croats feel the same️
You wouldn’t see that many Croats congratulating if it was Russia or Serbia
Thank you so much
Ukraine is beautiful as well, you guys have everything (even a desert if I’m not mistaken)
I would love to visit your country one day
Quite interesting, for me Ukrainian often sounds somehow artsy
It mostly sounds and starts very familiar and as it goes on you add your own twist to that
Then I‘m confused, because it‘s sounds familiar and most of the time has the same meaning, but the change of pronunciation makes me always doubt it haha
Thanks for the recommendation, I‘ll make sure to check it out
Many people in Croatia definitely have sympathies, because of that
[Some Croats] even went to defend Ukraine in the Crimea crisis
And from what I‘ve heard some Ukrainians volunteered and fought for Croatia as well in the 90ies
There are also other reasons, why Croats like Ukraine
One of them is the believed story that the territory of modern day Ukraine was home of a tribe called White Croats
They supposedly inhabited the Croatian territories in the 7th century and are considered to be the ancestors of Croats today
We are cheering for you as well
After Croatia defeated Russia on the WorldCup 2018, our defense player Domagoj Vida and some other guy were punished for saying [Slava Ukraini] Eventually, a lot of Ukrainians bashed Fifa’s facebook page and even few representatives in the [Ukrainian parliament wore Croatian jerseys] as a sign of support
Also [Serbian newspapers reported] after their national team biggest defeat in Lviv, that there was an Ukrainian-Croatian brotherhood march prior to the match through the streets of the city
Also some report that they saw Croatian flags in the stadium

Actually, there were less deaths than usual because everyone was being extra careful
Because what will this March accomplish
Will people say “you know, the last 10 marches didn’t convince me but this one will
” No they will not
If anything this march is doing the opposite
Like any large gatherings of people, trash will be left on the floor, to further hurt the environment
Also most of these people have probably done zero to actually help stop climate change
They are driving a car, buying imported food and clothes, buying plastic
They want to “save the planet” doing absolutely nothing and sacrificing nothing
This is stupid

Flew with Aegean few times
Great customer service, terrible planes
Truth be told, I never flew with croatia arilines
Like, ever :D
Tariffs are huge and tickets are too expensive
For example, return flight to Greece with Aegean cost me around 200€ (give or take)
It would have cost me double if I choose Croatia airlines
No source has anywhere that she's Scottish
Also, she sounds English
This appears to be the first instance of the video:
It *is* posted by someone from Scotland
But again, nowhere does it state the woman is Scottish
I don't know why the OP has invented her nationality
Perhaps it's because he believes, rightly or wrongly, that this sub has a pro-Scotland and anti-England bias, which is ridiculous
I think it has more impact coming from an English person because Scotland voted to remain
Also, if you break down her argument, it sounds like it comes from an English person's perspective rather than a Scottish person's considering Scotland voted in favour of remaining in the EU
Can anyone tell me what she said
Cant hear it where i am
Thanks
How so they keep the paint on the walls so clean white
It's really funny that most likely Croatia gave more to Serbia then China

Because here in the Balkans we are mostly against things based on how they look or how we're supposed to react to them, as you already know
So west bad ruined Yugoslavia without it us big world rulers, therefor against west good person country, China good
Plus I think Vučić has a hard on for authoritarianism anyways
It's a permanent state of picking a scab and yelling "See they are still hurting me
" unfortunately
It will die out, but we'll have to wait a bit
Montenegro is using Euro and on joining EU
Scotland can use it too if really necessary
It has some drawbacks, but I doubt that is an insurmountable obstacle for joining EU
Scotland can still opt for Euro if determined to join and this is actually necessary
And it is up to EU to  make an exception or not for Scotland
Or to make special arrangements until everything is ready
If all members agree, there is nothing stopping it

Watched the video and thought "Rivendell
Looks like a woman being thrown of a chair into the sea, and as she is falling she's praying
What year is this
[insert meme]
Hmm, is that Croatia on the left bottom
They would get either shot on the spot or suffer the same fate
Cenitrist Poland grilling
Easy for you with all that plain terrain
Try cycling in the Mediterranean or Balkan cities
I'm not just saying that it is hard to cycle uphill, although it really is
What I'm saying is that the traffic is chaotic and will always be that way
Uneven terrain shortens the field of sight and make the traffic less predictable and more prone to accidents
I just explained myself
It would be stupid to repeat myself if we are communicating in a written form
Moscow, Russia
I couldn't find any HD pics using reverse image search
Jesus, the paperwork looks like you are ordering uranium, not pet food
Hey, I know that brand
Food is great for dogs
That's some Croatia level paperwork shit for a simple thing
not from the uk but that nigel guy seems like a dick
Can someone explain more about the deal itself
I'm out of the loop lately
What exactly got resolved
so what happens with the Irish border now
Did they solve the border triple problem
The kind of unions that can be proposed varies drastically though
Yes, China, US and Russia have more soft power than the UK
But they also have more soft power than the EU
Wait
This might actually work
well there ARE street view data for Germany
I know because I normally used SV couple of years ago for a very small city/town Salzgitter
If there were SV there, I'm pretty sure there are SV everywhere across Germany
It's just because of the laws there Google is not allowed to display them
In other hand, on Mapillary, the free as in freedom data alternative to Google Streetview, they have loads of imagery:

Greetings from Croatia
Please do Croatia  cities I recomend our Split, Trogir, Zagreb
We are often not featured despite being in EU
You are obsessed with the US
RemindMe
20 days
so did they just mortar the missing elements on the facade
Why would you put stupid lies like this in the news
I dont get it,  something weird and fishy is here
Stay based Poland
You will into space one day
After everything else is left in commie Muslim rubble
Sounds similar to what's going on in Croatia right now
you can't even name cases like other nations standard (genitive, accusative, nominative, vocative, ect
I didn't mean both overlapped exactly
agreed
I'm actually surprised that Croatia is that low on the list
Our media usually spits and criticize the government almost every day
Though, they can be overwhelmingly manipulative when they want views
Uh I wish our press had less freedom
They are borderline retarded
They are the same as the British media
Example: they where campaigning for our army to buy unarmed planes because they are cheaper then armed ones
while ignoring that arming them will cost more then what our goverment tried to buy
Could have put the other (nonEU) countries up there as well
I’m not sure why Croatia is so low
I’ve never really heard of reporters here being biased
If anything they jump to any opportunity they can to call out the government, it’s what gets clicks after all
Formet communist countries be like: I can't do it, I can't let go that sweet censoring
as always
sigh
> Croatian journalists who investigate corruption, organised crime or war crimes are often subjected to harassment campaigns
Defamation is criminalized and insulting “the Republic, its emblem, its national hymn or flag” is punishable by up to three years in prison
Worse still, “humiliating” media content has been criminalized since 2013
The government has not stopped meddling in the affairs of public TV broadcaster HRT, and HRT’s management continues to sue employees who have complained about this problem, and has gone so far as to bring a complaint against the Association of Croatian Journalists
Meanwhile physical attacks, along with threats and cyber-violence, continue to be a major problem for journalists without any reaction from the authorities
Yeah that surprised me too
Don't know what is this based on because our media has a lot of freedom
We don't accept shithole countries
How is uk so low
(Eg hungary is stronger than uk)
Yay my country Croatia is getting popularrrrr
This whole situation with the greenery taking hold and animals coming back really shows how the post apocalyptic  urban jungle scenario was understated if anything
Haha to je u mojoj državi, ne vidiš to svaki put
Ik hoop dat het zal (did I say it right
If you need anything while you're here, feel free to send me a PM
Can confirm, yesterday had to do it at home
Now my body hurts
The dutch also drained parts of East Anglia and Lincolnshire in the UK
Make Ely an island again
Would unironically be pretty cool tbh, can you imagine travelling across wetlands on raised causeways and then there's an island with a big-ass cathedral over the horizon
Would be sick ngl
Don't know the details of how, but there are rivers there, so they set it up so that they first turned the sea to lake and than drain it
[Improvise

Submerge
Croatia is 100% true
Why leave at all
I am away from home for almost 10 years, but I am still evidented like I am living with my parents
Almost 32 years thats seriously depressing but not super suprising
Wish we in Croatia managed to group up over these things
Go neighbours
OP, you should at least provide some context, either your own comment or an article in the comments would be great
This is just a photo of a gathering on a square
I agree brother, I agree brate dragi
Oh no no no no not again, pls no Austria in Hungary again
This is actually one of the most intriguing maps I've seen recently
Had a lot of fun looking at it
croatia and serbia- name a more iconic duo
And somehow we still end up next to serbia
Breakup of Czechoslovakia would not be so peaceful in this alternate universe
Yaay finally away from Serb
wait a minute
I love how nothing changed for Croatia and Serbia, still next to eachother <3
can we like try with a different neighbour at least on imaginary maps for fucks sake
Croatia and Serbia still neighbour's. Truly meant to be
It kinda fits, right
Finland and Lithuania / Norway and Croatia and KINDA naturally compearable
Any recommendations
Where should I build my house
Bratislava was nice when I visited
Yoyoyoyo
Wait a second
Got it "back"?
Quite cold, rainy, cloudy
Also, forget about mountain climbing
You are compensated with some version of the sea
Nah we're good
Ah you are like the fifth person asking this
In this sub it would be nice if we all know all countries, right
Bosnia and Herzegovina, I cannot understand how is that not intuitive
Damn I can't imagine someone comes here from all the way up there
Do you take the plane directly to Brač or is it cheaper to go to Split and take the ferry
Ok Croatia and Serbia, calm down
I knew what you were referring to, but you never had our sea
C'mon, how many Hungarians ever lived in any coastline tows of Croatia
Jako dobra
Nah my bitchiness is really delightful once you get to know me better
You are welcomed, bro
On a serious note, there are like 50 countries in our continent and BH is not like an irrelevant one
Maybe I am biased but I really expected everyone to know
Yeah I bet that's an awesome experience
Whenever someone asks me what to do in Croatia (I live in Germany so it happens quite often), I tell them to just rent a boat and explore old towns, islands, inaccessible beaches etc
There's so much to do
I don't really know how to respond to that

Ne ne, Estonija je baltička Slovenija
Dobre ceste, odličan glavni grad
Jadna klima, priroda onako lijepa ali dosadna
Haha ok lol so "ende gut alles gut"
If you don't understand it look it up and again learn something new ;)
Awww it is German for "all's well that ends well"; we had a small conflict here but it led to you learning a new thing so we can remember it as a positive, good little event
Cringe
Sadly, the BiH is basically like a child of two divorced parents who keep fighting and are also overprotective and won't let the child move out, even though it's already like 30 or something
You might have a cold then
Yeah, it was a weird ordering, I thought it was originally by their endological (native) names, because 'Hrvatska' and 'Kroatien' are really close by (and I wasn't paying enough attention), but the last 3 totally confused me
"We". You surely are a valuable contribution with that kind of worldview
Jesus, I'm so bloody sad now
Yea could of photoshoped another moon to be like eyeballs
Whs is Croatia as one region
We have Panonija, Slavonija, Lika, Dalmacija, Gorski Kotar and Istra
I mean i knew it but it still hurts a lil bit
You, sir, are full of shit
Take this fucking map of yours and change Croatia from "less developed" to "idiotically underdeveloped" right now
Developed in what sense
lol
Zagreb isn't less developed
I wonder what will Croatia look like :D
Makes you wonder which one of your items will maybe one day be dug up by future archeologists

Swam across the Adriatic
That's impressive in an out of itself
Which part exactly
Because I can imagine that the hardest part of it would be avoiding the Yugoslav navy patrol
More importantly, dividends are how companies should be rewarding shareholders
Dividend stocks have shareholders that prefer steady returns over massive gains in share value
If the only thing a stock has going for it is the price constantly going up, that's what shareholders are going to demand
Who cares if a move ends up being catastrophic in the long run, it's making money now
There are good arguments against dividends in some cases
Some companies actually do need to grow fast just to stay competitive, but especially well established giants could really benefit from a "keep on, keeping on" approach, rather than trying to drive the share price up to even greater levels
Ultimately, the big difference is that buybacks are just one more tool in the share price driven world to sacrifice long term stability for short term gains, where as divided stock is only worth a damn if it's consistent and anything that compromises long term viability is going to hurt the share price
> Effectively it's the result of a EU-wide race to the bottom combined with increased globalization
It's a global race and it's not to the bottom but rather an equilibrium - a fair tax rate for public services
Nobody wants to live in a Mad Max wasteland
Don't stop there - anything less than 50% tax on anybody richer is outright theft from the proletariat
It really isn't. It's reported income, publically reported in fact
If you actually wanted to dodge paying taxes you would never, ever take your money out of your company anywhere in the EU
While it's taxed at a lower rate than a salary, to pay a divided you need to first make a profit
Then you need to report said profit and not use accounting tricks to hide it
Then there's the bit where you're actually running a business rather than just getting a paycheck
You need to deal with all the government requirements, report everything, pay taxes, not just have your employer subtract them from your salary
My dad incorporated for tax reasons while still basically being an employee and he gets to keep a bit more than he makes, but regrets the move
An accountant doing his books would negate most if not all of the gains so he now essentially has a part time job on top of his full time job
Unless you're already run a businesses and have to do that stuff anyway, it's absolutely not worth it
If you make enough for it to be worth it, there are better, perfectly legal ways to save far, far more in taxes
Criminal law
You can't charge people with a crime if the action wasn't criminal when they did it
This is a government bailout
The government sets any condition it wants
Not really
it's that way by _design_. Government don't care about fairness when it comes to taxes
They only care about filling public coffers
Fairness doesn't even enter the calculation
The only time "fairness" is even mentioned is when they need to turn on their propaganda machines for the masses
For example - why are salaries taxed so heavily compared to, well, everything else
> Inequality will only increase
It's kind of funny how inequality is only ever mentioned in the context of domestic policies
Very rarely will somebody mention inequality in a global context
And with good reason - someone might point out that even the poorest European is rather well off compared to a person living in Africa in, for example, a former colony of a European power
I was thinking more along the lines of wealth redistribution - why isn't anybody suggesting we redistribute wealth from "rich" Europe to Africa
After all, I'm sure Europe could do without cutting edge cancer treatment if it meant Africa got basic health services
But it would be smaller and weaker than NATO currently is
Didnt the greeks started this shit ?
EU has more people though
USA has done 25M tests in total, which is around 77k tests/1M people
From major EU countries, Spain did more tests (103k), Italy about the same (77k), and others less (Germany 56k, Poland 32k, France 21k)
But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections
Humans can eradicate diseases
Just because they exist naturally it doesn’t mean that humans shouldn’t fight against them to advance their own interests
Indeed, though I’m always really cautious with any such comparisons
Just because official data suggests one thing, it doesn’t mean we should relax too much
It can always come back for as much as we know, and the data may be flawed to begin with
Death rates vs the previous year are all but worthless since all kinds of numbers are out of whack, most notably traffic accidents being down significantly
Here in Croatia we might actually have fewer deaths than last year if the current Corona mortality holds and tourist season traffic doesn't pick up
The numbers would consequently indicate Corona saving lives
Interesting
I took itnfrom here:
It’s in per 1M people
They benefited from everyone around them taking strict measures
International travel grinding to a halt made it easy to control the virus if the spread wasn't too advanced and precautions were taken
However, it doesn't take many cases for the disease to spread rapidly if left unchecked
In Croatia during the height of the pandemic you couldn’t even travel between cities without a permit
So, now protests are to blame for the pandemic, last time I checked it was Obama
Why did they keep the debate format then
We had a similar situation a few weeks ago where the opposition leader refused to participate
But they did not keep the podium and debate format, instead they turned it into 1 on 1 extended interview with the candidate
Worst timing ever really, we just changed our tires to summer ones and then woke up next morning with a snow storm

There seems to be a large amount of people saying Armenia is off-topic which is not correct
We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of our [Official geographical policy] of /r/Europe
>The main focus of /r/Europe is the geographical region of Europe within the borders of the Caucasus, Ural and Bosporus strait (plus Cyprus, Greenland as well as the Caucasus countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia)
>In addition to the areas mentioned above all areas belonging to members of the Council of Europe in their entirety (plus Kazakhstan) are considered on-topic for casual submissions, as long as they don't violate any other rules
Što je slatka
>There are two major countries in Europe that are transcontinental (Russia and Turkey) where special rules apply for the geographically Asian parts
>News submissions from these geographically Asian areas of Russia and Turkey are only considered on topic if the news is pan-Russian/pan-Turkish (e.g. national politics, protests, major events) or if it is directly engaging another European nation
I mean, you were part of the roman empire and a majority of your country is christian, sounds pretty european to me
I didn't mean it as being exlusive, also i was too tired to write an essay about the cultural similarities with european culture etc
Looks like some traditional garments
They seem similar to the ones in the balkans
I didn't say it was exclusive and i was too tired to type an essay why armenia is a part of europe
~~They're arabs or arabians, i forget which one is which
~~The regions culture has changed after the islamic invasions and the religion changed as well
Sorry i missread your comment
But this is all mute since most people look at europe geographically instead of culturally
Is gibraltar strait still open
just few days ago i was getting heavily downvoted on r/serbia for saying that srebrenica is a genocide
i mean, what the fuck, how can you be so close minded and brainwashed to say it wasnt after reading the testimonies and seeing all the evidence
because western europe more or less thinks that eastern european history/news are non-existing

Europe desperetaly needs a massive protest which will succeed in fullfiling its goal
Not just Europe, the world itself, there are too many massive protests catching the eye of the public and interest of milions and then just dying out without any sort of actual change being made
My heart goes out to those brave people, who i admire greatly, in Serbia, Hong Kong, Lebanon and many many others and now Belarus and i cannot even imagine the hopelesness one must feel upon seeing everything going back to as it were before after so much effort and sacrifice was made
But do not despair, you just might be the one fullfiling their goal because shadow is but a passing thing, when the sun shines it will shine out the clerarer

That’s just communists bull crap tbh
more money into the hands of corrupted government makes it even worst
No it doesn’t. It’s much deeper and more complex than that
Your words are just cheap socialist populistic bull shit ppl like to hear
You are probably working in the public sector yourself so you don’t give a damn where the money for your benefits comes from
For my country (Croatia) estimates are that of 100€ of taxes 30€ goes back in the system the rest is eaten by the administration/government itself
Those inept incapable bureaucratic corrupted fucks are eating the life of the private sector, they just want more more more taxes to hire more relatives and party members
Man it really turned into Half Life 2
We've really gotten on the train of hating police, like the American puppets we are, eh

I'm not taking either side here, I'm just pointing out that recently "police bad" posts skyrocket to hot without much effort

it's pretty much what the Serbians did in Srebrenica when they took over, they promised to take care of the civilian population, saying that they're treating them fairly during an interview and now that place is known for the biggest genocide and war crime that happened during the Yugoslav civil war
It's insane that still to this day they're denying the things they did and that some outside people actually believe them, even my country's shit corrupt government didn't deny the horrible crap NDH did in WW2

Pretty crazy to think about
Jesus was born around 5 AD
It's actually fairly weird how close that is 1 BC is to the actual birth of Christ, considering we started counting dates from his birth more than 500 years after he was born
Obviously, like everything that's millenia old, it's an estimate, so take it with a grain of salt
There's pretty strong consensus among historians, especially credible ones, that Jesus was definitely a historic figure
We're also pretty sure he was born in Galilee, he was baptized by John the Baptist, was a preacher with a large following, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate
The rest is kind of up for debate
There are also lots of sources that aren't biblical, both Cristian and non-Christian
A few historians of the time are considered credible, including Thallos, Josephus and Tacitus
There are also mentions of Jesus in the Talmud
There's a pretty good list of evidence and what we know here:

Tnx for the reply
wonder why I got downvotes, I think I made a legit question
All ex-communist countries have that same problem, I am not even sure it can ever be solved
At least by the experience we have in Croatia, because it’s not only the government or the parliament, it’s all the local governments, regions, cities, councils, all the public companies on all levels, there is corruption everywhere and it includes hundreds of thousands of ppl
All the system is broken
The political parties have been successfully infiltrating their people everywhere , that with time have become corrupt and now they all want to maintain that status quo (because they live a decent life out of public money and what they get under the table to actually do their jobs)
Don’t change a thing
And these ppl have friends and families
Basically there is something like 1/3 or more of the population that is part of the sick corrupt system and they have the control of everything and it’s almost impossible to change all of that
And they are dragging the country down for decades
While the private sector struggles and young ppl run away

No, they're not
The fact that Bosnia existed before Ottomans has nothing to do with the borders of todays Croatia and BiH
The modern understanding of borders comes from the 19th century
It’s exactly because of the Ottoman invasion
Dalmatia, for the most part, was never part of the Ottoman Bosnian Eyelet and switches rulers more than any region in that part of Europe
The border between Croatia-Dalmatia and Bosnia was officially established nearly **two centuries ago**.
What are you on about
I did not say that Bosnia did not exist before Otomans
Ofcourse it did, but not in borders like today
They are product of Habsburg/Ottoman empires
Looks rather similar for me
Sure the borders keep moving through time
But round looking
Bosnia yes, but not Croatia
Are you fucking dense
Do you even read what people are telling you
>The fact that Bosnia existed before Ottomans has nothing to do with the borders of todays Croatia and BiH

Can someone explain me why is Breivik allowed to live in a 3-room cell with television, PC and gym
He should be locked in a 3 m2 cell with a hole used as toilette and that's it
Like the fact that he will be free aged 53 isn't enough sad and unfair
Do law makers understand that those kids had whole lives ahead of them
Many of them never experienced simple joys in life we don't even think about, things we don't even notice as something special because they appear to us as normal, everyday joys
They will never meet their better half, get drunk with friends
those kids won't turn 18 or whatever is adult age in Norway
Lives of their parents, brothers, sisters, grandmas, grandpas, friends is destroyed
Most marriages never recover after losing a child and therefore other kids suffer too
Older people often get sick and die after losing a grandson/grandaughter
So many young ambitious people, people who wanted to change the world to a better place are not with us because of someone's madness
And now, as his prize, he lives a better life than 80% of world population
I hope someone takes justice in own hands when Breivik is free because the law is obviously on his side
Sorry about "free to leave after 21 years" part
I didn't read wiki article till the end
That man has no purpose for society
He is just spending goverment's money
He is suing Norway for not treating him right
Isn't that hypocritical
Did he care for basic human right- right to live while killing all those innocent people
I don't see him and other people capable for doing such crimes as persons
They are dangerous animals and should be treated that way
I'm not saying that the law is on side of people who eant to kill Breivik, but opposite
I say that the law is on Breivik's side because I don't see his sentence as something that punishes him
>and you could end up in prison yourself by accident
No, I don't think I can accidentaly commit massive murder
>try to preserve your own dignity by not abusing weak and damaged humans
He is not weak, just seriously damaged
I'm getting a feeling that you kinda feel bad for him
That's because you are big human
You can feel empathy even for bad people
On the other hand he doesn't.
>It doesn't give the victims satisfaction or justice, it doesn't prevent crimes from happening
Ofc it doesn't, but at least it would take his complacent smile off his face

CENTRAL
WE TAKE IT
We made it boys
The fact this line splits Italy and France, bit puts entire Croatia in a single region is ridiculous
Personally Croatia should be split in three parts
We are very small but the regions on the sea have nothing in common with the inland and then again inland is split in 2 parts
What differs from what I personaly considered:
- My country, Croatia, is always in between of central, southern and southeastern
When I explain where Croatia is to someone who doesn’t know, I say we’re “the southernmost part of central Europe, you know where’s Italy
Just across the sea from them
(silent pause while they’re looking at the map) Not that side, that’s Africa; the other side”.
- I never considered Estonia, Latvia & Lithuania central European, they were alway some weird eastern/northern mix to me
happy croat-slovene noises
Central Europe is Austra-Hungary & Germany
Central Europe, yes
Maybe if you cleared your throat before speaking Germans might consider you closer to them
Historically
Yes
Politically
It's debatable
Culture
We're actually influenced by all 3 South, Southeast and Central Europe depending on part of country
Geographically the same
I don't get why this version and many other maps put whole countries in the same region
I mean some countries are really diverse
Croatia is a great example of that
The border is probably made on the old Hapsburg-Ottoman line

Hmm, pretty sure that there are older businesses in Croatia

>Croats, Montenegrins, Albanians: do tourists sometimes use Italian names for your cities
Do Italian tourists do
If so, does that annoy you
They don't use Italian names, but what is annoying is when Italian tourists expect everyone here to understand Italian (when most people don't) and refuse to speak English (which most people do)
And it is them who need fucking directions, I don't benefit from the conversation at all
Shouldn't you be begging for Istria instead
Wanna trade it for Trieste
It's annoying that this is somehow a debatable issue
Geographically, Europe is quite clearly defined, Anatolia is not part of it, Thrace is
Non-geographically, we shouldn't be discussing Europe, because Europe IS a geographical concept
Turkey does have land in Europe, not all of it is inside Europe, non of this is debatable
As for weather or not Turkey should be in the EU and other questions of grouping Turkey with European countries, there's a lot more to consider than geography, but every time people invoke geography and manage to disagree on a well established fact
Yes, of course, but they don't get used in day to day life
On this day 28 years ago, the fiercest battle Europe has seen since World War II ended with the fall of Vukovar
>Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against as many as 36,000 JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery
During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day
At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War
When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled
Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina
Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle
>The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war
A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later
Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia with the signing of the Erdut Agreement
It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle
Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity
[Some lesser known photos from Vukovar] (NSFW)
Siege of Vukovar is a modern tale of 300 Spartans
Take a look at it this way
From one side, you have the Croatian forces
Only 1800 personnel, most of them were cops, others were volunteers, poorly equipped, with only light weaponry or outdated rifles
Pistols and old bolt rifles, and no support
On the other side, you have the YNA
000 personnel arriving from Danube with tanks, armored support, helicopters, artillery rockets, heavily armed soldiers, and a huge amount of support
Even the most biased, optimistic strategists would give Croatians maybe a week, two weeks, as they were outnumbered 20 to 1 with barely any weaponry compared to the YNA
But no, they defended the city for **87 days
** That's almost 3 months
3 fucking months on depleted supplies and constantly losing men
As such, despite the horrors that the Vukovar region bore witness, also including the Ovčara massacre, it's also a point of pride for us
They held the city on almost nothing but sheer willpower and hope despite knowing that it's futile
It's the definition of a Phyrric victory
Despite finally taking over the city, the YNA lost 1100 men and 3500 more were wounded, they also lost 3 planes and 110 tanks, nor to mention, so much time that they could have used to massively push forwards towards Zagreb, which was only 185 miles away and could have been reached easily, since the Croatian Army was just barely formed and wasn't ready for such an advance seige
[Here is some footage] that I always found disturbing, but it best demonstrates not just the destruction of the city, but the civilians killed and thousands forced into exile at gunpoint
What makes it all the more hard to watch is the fact that hundreds of them were taken and massacred outside of town [at Ovčara] and hundreds more taken into [prison camps in Serbia] (Stajićevo, Begejci, Sremska Mitrovica, Aleksinac, Niš, Belgrade) where they were mentally and physically tortured and dozens where killed
I'm glad to see that our war is  mentioned and remembered
I was in that town few years ago
Seeing that hospital, hearing about people dying, hearing about how 3 kids were born in that hospital during that time
The story about bomb being dropped through ceiling on a patient's bed
I was shocked about it
Hearing about how every day new Croatian flag was put on that tower
Knowing it will be attacked even more until there is no flag
And being impressed how that mighty tower is still proudly standing, after everything it has gone through
I live in Croatia, I'm so lucky I didn't have to experience it
And serbs be like: "But we were not aggressors, we defended"
My dad still has a belt buckle with a GDR coat of arms on it
Thanks for that
Thank you for helping when help was most needed ️

Here's another pic of the same street:
Balkan wars is something of a prelude to world war 1

One moment from that video is something I remember even to this day - the guy saying "sve su to ubice i kasapi, lez'te dole". Every once in a while that hateful son of a bitch pops into my mind and I wonder where he is now and if anything ever happened to him for what he did
If he's alive somewhere, hopefully he dies the most painful way possible
The EU is an idealistic project rooted in humanism, Yugoslavia was rooted in totalitarianism
It was doomed to fail just like the Soviet Union
UN soldiers in Srebrenica were literally tied to a fence while the genocide was being done
they just went half-arsed thinking nobody is going to dare to do anything
Ukraine would like to have a word with you
Ah yes,  as a Belgian you'd be the expert here
Tell me, how many days without government will it be the next time
>  Serbs may not have started the war
Yes, they did, first, they attacked Slovenia
And after that, they armed the Serbian population in Croatia and supported them to start the "civil" war which they joined with their army not long after with excuse that they're defending those Serbian's in Croatia
(Which again they armed and manipulated to start fighting and at the end when they saw that they will lose the war, abandoned and tell them to run away from Croatia
And after that played victim card that they were forced "ethnically cleaned" out of Croatia )
And also they started a war in Bosnia
Anyway, a retarded move by the Serbian government, in general, to start a war after Yugoslavia break up
Yugoslavia broke up, and so what, return to normal life like it was before Yugoslavia and that's it
But no, they wanted to make "great Serbia".
And what's even sadder, all those generals, politicians etc
were huge rednecks and also they armed plenty of criminals to fight for them, and whole nation followed them and commanded them
It would seem you don’t know much about Yugoslavia
It was federation of republics: Slo, Cro, BiH, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro + two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina and Kosovo
Every federative rep had right to secede by Constitution
(We are not talking about provinces here or regions, but republics
Then they put in new [Constitution from 1974] that the decision about secession needs to be unanimous
That means that every federative rep needed to say yes
That’s not really:
> without approval from the state itself
You see, Yugoslavian Federal Presidency aka Yugoslavian government (the state itself) had no real power anymore in 80s. Power was in federative rep
All federal rep had a long history and were independent in some point in history
You seem to be under impression that Yugoslavia was some kind of real and old country
It wasn’t. It was communist country 45 years old, under one-party system made by unification of nations which became federal republics
> Defending the existence of Yugoslavia would've been admirable
Had the nation remained intact,
Yugoslavia was federation of rep, not a nation
> Had the nation remained intact, it would likely be one of the leading powers of Europe today to the benefit of all its peoples
Yeah, leading power of EU with food stamps, you cant drive your car every second day, if youre not a part of the party you might as well not exist, etc
Topkek, keep telling yourself your sad stories

> but I remember
I remember when Serbs run before Ottomans and Croatia gave them refuge some centuries ago
I remember it like it was yesterday
You do understand that majority of the Croats were in partizans during WW2 and fought against Ustashe
> “However the Ustashe never received massive support from ordinary Croats
From your link
Communist Yugoslavia was 45 years old
As I wrote
I wasn’t talking about first Yugoslavia
I know what Constitution says
I also know when and why it was done
I never said that the secession was legal, but I do think it was right
Especially as there is that one thing called self-determination
Yeah, i'll trust you
After all you live on the other side of the world while i live in croatia
Of course you should know more about the topic than the rest of us
Please, tell me more about what happened here
If and when you manage to climb down from your high horse, I will be more than happy to rectify and fill some of the more obvious gaps in your knowledge
Saying that Ustasa ideology is in any way, shape or form influencing Croatia now (or that it was present as a majority movement during the 90's) is not only factually incorrect but a damned and very malicious lie
For God's sake man, our first president was Tito's general
We had right on a basis of self-determination as we lived in our nation-state, had historical territory and were republic
This is not an issue
Everyone knows this
You can google this and you have many scientific papers about it
Serbs in Cro were just minority
Nothing else
And Krajina was nothing
No territorial organisation whatsoever in 1991
I already said that by constitutional changes in 1974 our secession wasn’t legal, but as it happened and all other countries recognized us and we won the war defending ourselves, it’s legal now
And here we are

Slovenia : NO
Nah, Slovenia will most definitely block us
You would probably block our entry (even if Slovenia did a complete 180)
Oh I understand completely
And to be honest, I wouldn't hold it against you if you did block us, it's been almost a friggin decade for you guys (and only a few months for us)
I would be pissed beyond measure if I were in your shoes and some other country enters the EU e.g. Montenegro and gets the green light to enter the Schengen
Croatia would also block them
I did some readings about that and the conclusion I made is that Croatia is about to enter the Schengen individually; without Bulgaria and Romania, because of interests of the European powerhouses like Germany, Italy, France etc
The decision is due in mid-2020
Of course, Bulgaria and Romania have the right (and probably will try) to block it and I'd completely understand that, considering the fact how long they're waiting themselves
But it seems that it's Germany and co
who have the last word about that
The Schengen enlargement falls within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, an area which still requires approval from all EU member states
Well
there's Greece without any Schengen land neighbours

According to the article, those are not bigger, but literally the same problems you guys have
Oh look at that
Someones' personal view differs from what the media say
What are the odds
Your point leads to my comment, in which my i stated my own personal conclusion independent from the media
You pointed out a Croatian news article, for wich you claimed that it says that we have bigger problems than you do
I proceeded to enlighten you, since the article negates your own statement; the article states that those are the same problems, which Bulgaria and Romania are currently facing regarding the Schengen accession
You, afterwards, tried to prove me wrong by quoting my comment, in which I shared my own personal conclusion, which differs from what the media and that specific article say
It doesn't mean I'm right, nor does it mean that I'm wrong
I hope that clarifies it for you
r/AccidentalRenaissance in the upper right corner
Coming from a small country, I find this all pretty funny
Free movement of capital and labor is great until it isn't - for the big players
So let's force countries like Ireland and Luxembourg and what-not to change so that poor Germany and France aren't losing any more tax money
But let's not touch freedom of movement for labor - God forbid that richer members can't siphon any more human capital from poorer members
That would throw a wrench in their economies and we can't have that, can we
True - but let's be honest - what fucks you harder; not getting that sweet tax revenue, or losing hundreds of thousands of your people which you desperately need to staff your industries and public institutions and effect social change
> you're labeled big evil bureaucrat European Union
Evil
Egoistical
Definitely
If Germany or France has a problem, the EU has a problem
If anybody else has a problem, you can go solve your own damn problem
We don't want to encroach on your "sovereignty".
By that logic, there's a very simple solution to solve all of humanity's problems - just kill everybody
No humanity - no problems
> Germany and France are the biggest contributors
Of course they want to defend their interests and of course the EU has a problem when two of the biggest net contributors have a problem
See, I was under the impression that the EU was a European project - and that includes all the member states, not just France and Germany
If I'm wrong, maybe Brexiteers aren't all that crazy after all
> It's easy to hate on the EU but people tend to forget how much money flows into countries who contribute almost nothing
And all that money means diddly squat
Let me explain - just because countries _can_ get funds doesn't mean they will nor that those funds will be spent wisely ( [example] )
Now, before you start with the "well it's their own fault
" you have to remember something - Croatia lost up to 300,000 people (according to unofficial numbers) in the last couple of years
Those people aren't participating in the Croatian economy, aren't staffing its public institutions or trying to improve their country for the better through political action
And crucially for your argument - aren't trying to get EU funds and use them to improve their country
So you're left with two kinds of people - the incompetent, who can't get access to EU funds and if they do, can't use them effectively, and the corrupt, who use the money to line their pockets
So yeah, you can keep your money - I'd rather have my countrymen here trying to build this country into a respectable place to live rather than spending their working lives enriching the German (or Irish, or whichever) economy
> How are France and Germany egoistical if they're the biggest net contributors
Because they present their problems as everybody's problems
But that principle obviously doesn't apply when other member countries have a problem
And I wouldn't call Poland small (if that's what you're implying)

I’m still trying to wrap my mind around this

Austria has always gone an extra mile to be inclusive
This is just so mindless

Shit
Stay safe
It is
It was
And I’m sure it will stay one of the safest cities
Austrians are nothing, if not pragmatic
So I’m sure you guys will find the way for this never to happen again
Neither am I directly affected
But I do feel violated and angry nonetheless
Vienna was my home for quite some time
I grew to love that city and it’s people
And the fact I never felt unsafe
Support is for common sense
For an inclusive, humane, empathic society we are trying to build
For the victims who had to pay the highest price for Europe to one day hopefully achieve all that
For their families and friends
And for every Viennese and Austrian person who will feel violated by this senseless act
Today it was Vienna
But this won’t stop until something changes
We need to figure out why this is happening
And do something about it
Bottom line is, we are in this shit together
We do stand behind you
And together we can push for the change

I want to say that this year's and the previous year's Summers have been by far not as hot as the ones up until 2 years ago
Up until two years ago, I couldn't even sleep at night naked because of how hot I'd been
I would lay on the tiles of my floor in order to get cooled down by them, and then I'd eventually fall asleep after like 30 minutes or an hour of trying to accept the heat
This year and the last year, I've had only a couple of such nights
It was hot, but no where near as hot as it was up until two years ago
The hottest temperature I could find in Europe were Paris, France at 35 and Dubrovnik, Croatia at 34
Everyone: France u gud man
France: no
Pain
love this weather
love this weather
TIL that "heatwave" is 27 celsius
So there were uprisings in Paris
TIL
Such a peaceful town
Woa, woa
I was sure my sarcasm was damn obvious
I went to school, revolution, paris commune and shit, saw les misarables, several versions, read the book in fact
For christ sake, went several times to paris, walked the northern parts
I even like this song: [Paris is burning] Oh, and she's great
Oh, well
talking of trivias and les miserables, that roundabout in the upper right corner is place victor hugo, conected to arc via the victor hugo avenue

He's holding the staff of Hermes (two snakes) instead of the staff of Asclepius (one snake)
Asclepius was god of medicine and doctors, while Hermes was the god of thieves, liars, salesman (among other things)

Because they weren't in the EU
At which point they skyrocketed and are now above the UK in basically every metric, from life expectancy to income which also reflects in a higher Human development index
This map is bad, because 49% is red and 50% is green
It needs a yellow inbetween
When it comes to Croatia (and Slovenia I guess), the Muslim part is green because when that question is asked we think about Bosniaks which are culturally almost the same as us
I would be perfectly fine with that
I would be very reserved about Middle eastern Muslims, not because of religion but vastly different cultures
Especially if I had a daughter, because of the status women have in that society
Croatia confirmed Western
Croatian parents just dont fucking care XD
P R O G R E S S I V E
really interested if for "relashionship with Black person" would change if Carribean-black and African-black were different questions (atleast for the UK)
So wrong for Croatia where did they get their info :D
At least for the top and bottom left
Swedes are weebs
yeah, those statistics are wrong about Croatia
Somehow I doubt this data, as a Croat
Also, why not include balkan countries (I know this is the EU, but it would be "interesting". Also, what's up with Czechs and Slovaks
Something is wrong here
There is simply no way some of these statements are true for Croatia
Croatia too
Although we favour Asians a bit
Wat
They're culturally and ethnically European
That's the similarity
Afghanistan isn't an extreme example, it's one of the few places left that genuanly has a different culture
While every group everywhere wants to think of them selves as unique an special, there are maybe a handful of district cultures currently on the planet
Everything is homogenous
Everyone listens to the same music, wears the same clothes, basically speaks the same language
Everything from food and art to architecture, law, business and education has been condensed in to a few major groups
There are diffences within the major groups, but they're mostly surface level
If you compare people with similar backgrounds in similar situations in different countries around Europe, you find a bunch of similar people
The principal cause of percieved rifts is that people are comparing them selves to others in different circumstances
Basically rich countries see them selves as culturally similar to rich countries and dissimilar to poor countries because culture is percieved superficially
It doesn't matter that a poor, uneducated person in one country acts much the same as a poor uneducated person in another, simply because one country has more poor uneducated people it will be seen as a country with a culture of poverty and ignorance, reguardless of external factors that may have created the situation
E.g. Ireland was the poor, uneducated and thus culturally backwards country for centuries
Then it becomes rich and presto, now it's a poster child of Western culture
The South of Europe was the center of trade, learning and commerce
It was where Western culture originated and where it was reborn during the Renesanse
Then trade shifted away from the Med and suddenly everyone's a lazy bum
Circumstances change people and nation's. Having a similar culture means that under similar circumstances, people will act in a similar fashion
The idea that things like wealth are a product of a superior culture are little more than wishful thinking as it allows us to imagine that we could never be poor as it is in our nature to be rich and successful
Unlike every other nation or people, ours will stand the test of time, because we're just that good
In reality you could probably classify a majority of the people on the planet as being part of the "American but with a twist culture group" That's why places like Afganistan that aren't part of that overarching group seem like extreme examples
Everyone else is making pizza with local toppings and they're making some sweet rice thing that's not even pretending to be pizza
Bulgerioum
This just sums up how the most of americans does not know geography
depends if you a bitch, and want a small part of sea that wont make any difference at all
I'm sorry dude, but you don't think its worth getting worked up over it, right
Europe <3
You are wrong on all claims
Sorry mate, I see no logical causality in what you are saying
Also, US cant limit my internet no matter where sites are for 2 reasons: 1
They are not my ISP, 2
There is such thing called CDN
So how is the height scaled
Are the tallest mountains just 15 or so blocks high
In your dreams
I wish the rest of Europe was as chill as Great Britain or Portugal
Fun
Funny how no matter how much one has, them always seeks for more
You have like 200 000 lakes, yet you think about how Russia has 1 000 000
They are the world's largest country, yet dream of having warm seas
We Croats have 1 200 nice islands, yet we are annoyed that Greece has 6 000
Greeks dream of having more territories they had hundreds or thousands of years ago
Give us a list of all those who voted for this shitty bill to pass and we'll do our best to remove them from positions of power
Time for everyone to hate Europe in the coming weeks, and rightfully so
I used to think EU was actually good
Now after 5 years in the EU(i live in croatia) and seeing that EU has done nothing usefull for my country + the things i learned that they are doing,Its time to get rid off EU or reform so much that it shouldnt be even called EU anymore
>Ok, well, it's time to go back to the drawing board and come up with new protocols and systems which circumvent this bullshit
This is the answer
If we make a decentralized news agregator service, we can have it all: our snippets, and no Google
There will be a full report when the vote ends
Because you voted for the ones who lost or because you didn't vote
Wow, of course the worst statistics are in black
I see how it is
But seriously, who the fuck thought black numbers on a black background are easy to read
Why is there such a difference between czechia and slovakia
I've been reading lately about the Brabant murders and the pedophile scandals of the 90's. What the fuck Belgium ?
*in Europe
Africa, on the other hand
Probably Americans brate
Quick, how can I make this about religion
Yes, the whole affair is just surreal
Its hard to imagine someone so incompetent
*After Mélissa and Julie were kidnapped in 1995, it took police 14 months to arrest Dutroux even though he had been a prime suspect from the start and had committed similar crimes before
During the search for Mélissa and Julie, police visited Dutroux's house twice on 13 December and 19 December where Julie and Mélissa were held
However, no attempts were made to free them, even though the locksmith who accompanied the police, René Michaux, said that he heard screams of children coming from inside the house
The locksmith repeatedly said: "I'm not leaving before we turn the place upside down
The screams are clearly coming from inside the house
" To which Michaux replied: "Who is the police officer here
You or me
Not only was he not fired, the police officer was I think eventually promoted
Incredible
Also, I've heard about the possible connections of the Brabant killers with Operation Gladio, right wing government and all that
Crazy and really interesting stuff
There's a difference between Eslalit and Benelux and that's that one of the countries in the Benelux is made up
I'm not an economist
I didn't follow the debates and programs that talked about the Euro replacing the Kuna
What I do know is that everyone says that there are more benefits to the Euro
And yeah, having the same currency as most of Europe is sensibly the better choice
But as a simple pleb, I just think the Kuna is more practical
I don't know why, but every time I handled Euros it was always
weird
So, I would like to ask: If you were alive when your country switched from the local currency to the Euro, how did you accept the change
Was it weird for you
Do you miss your old currency
Edit: spelling
Why do you even use a non-bank ATM, those are the "scam" ones
Just find a normal ATM associated with a bank, or even better find an ATM associated with your bank, most European banks are owned by a bigger one
If your local bank is owned by Societe Generale, Unicredit, or whatever, the group usually has lower or even no fees when withdrawing from their ATMs no matter where they are in Europe
Is it so hard to do research in advance, especially in era of smartphones
Finding proper ATMs and checking the exchange rate takes 5 minutes tops
[At least 3 Euronet ATMs] in Slovakia, there probably other non-bank ATMs
They're only really placed in touristy areas since they're whole goal is to screw tourists over on exchange rates
I've never seen any in inland Croatia, but they're all over the coast
Only tourists use them, and almost always there's a bank ATM 10 meters away
I'm not attacking you specifically, but I am ranting because I have heard this complaint all the times, yet it's all stopped by 5 minutes of research
Also why would you even get money from an ATM abroad, usually the best option is to buy currency at home
I've only really had to use ATM abroad once in Romania, because it's hard to buy leu in Croatia, and even then I found my bank group ATM right at the airport, so no funny business, and no commission
If you're going to any country using a more popular currency like USD, CAD, JPY, CHF, etc, you can just buy it from your bank
Even if they don't have it immediately you just call them up and order it, it takes them 3 days tops to get it, you can even specify denominations you want
As I've linked in my other reply they do exist, [Euronet exists in Slovakia]
Iran is hot it does not even have color
Spain is me after waking up for the next 8 hours
I think some people usually draw Croatia similar ro Nepal with teeth trying to eat Bosnia but it is a beatiful map anyway :D. Also maps without Iceland but we don't have to talk about that
So cool, nice work
Everyone knows Iceland doesn't exist
why does it look like dinarids mountain chain are the highest mountains, and Alps are barely noticable against all the other scattered mountains
Ah yes, if it's Russian, it must have a star
It's not evil, it's a matter of opinion
perkele
.. am i doing it right
"Welcome to Hell"
Oof
Oh wow am in third place NICE
Not even surprised
Yay 3rd worst
Way to go
Well how you're supposed to pay bills on time when they don't even arrive on time
Also, probably online banking has huge role in this, for example in my family 90% pays bills manually, only few of them does it via some app or something
And paying manually is pain in the ass, you have to go to post, bank or somewhere, and also people are lazy to do that haha
I always find Greece, Bulgaria and us being on top of maps for all the wrong reasons
Nah
It's really bad
I don't know about Slovenia but here people are massively emigrating to western countries
Even pensioners can't raise it but how much the pension is low
Backwards

Fuck Nazis and Fuck Stalin
In croatia we too have problems with our state universities
Most of our academics are morally bankrupt and the rector of the Zagreb University, the most important one, Boras is an insult to the entire education system
He lacks basic manners
In a ceremony where the best army cadets received awards, he approached a female cadet and told her to take off her facemask so "that everyone could see her beautiful face" and added that she is "not only smart, but beautiful too" on live tv
However, the worst thing is that he is a religious fanatic and is poisoning every college (Faculty) 1 by 1 by installing his people there

Fun fact:
There are still 11 UN member states which haven't formally recognised Croatia or established diplomatic relations with Croatia
*Bhutan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Eswatini (Swaziland), Liberia, Marshal Islands, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan, Tonga and Tuvalu
It should be the same for all EU countries
Jebeni Niger :D
I mean it was way worse ~10 years ago
so I'll take this
Tbf most of these countries have long-lasting and ongoing internal problems and the least of their worries is the diplomatic relation with a new far-away politically insignificant European country
It seems that my source is a bit outdated
Thank you for the info
I believe that I expressed myself a bit wrong
Croatia is politically insignificant for those countries mentioned above, since we don't have any diplomatic relation, economic import/export deal or business, history or any contact whatsoever with each other
It's officially recognized as [Croatian national dish] as well
Please, leave your nationalistic views aside
This is not the moment, the topic nor the place for that
It is only Bosnian national dish, but it has spread to Serbia and Croatia, as well as to the other countries
Same goes for burek
Never said they originate from Croatia
And "famous" does not mean "original". So, omce again
this is Bosnian national dish
It has spread to other countries
But
like always, Serbs will calim whatever they get their hands on
From burek and cevapi, to sarma and rakija
To them it has all originated there
Doesn't even matter that even Romania has sarma for an example
smh
>(Looks at the new mod candidates)
Yeah, that's right, look at them, definitely not at me, the newest mod

In Croatia, the priests are employed in hospitals on a good salary, and it was all introduced by Social-Democrats
We don't even need clerical fascists, we have social democrats for that purpose
Of course, the Constitution is shitting about the secular state, but who cares
He is wearing a cassock
That's a yearly tradition in Croatia as well
Priests come, bless your house, take whatever money you've placed on the table and leave until next year round
Few years back the priest was coming early on 1

I probably missed half of those blessing due to being hangover as hell

I thought that's what elections are for
This is opposite of tragic
We have more than we need
We have a lot of people dumpster diving
What do you thing they are looking for
It is impossible to precisely calculate exactly how much food is necessary and those who tried a top down system like that starved millions
It is better to overproduce and waste some than leave people hungry
Complaining about waste amd calling it tragic is really out of touch with the reality of human condition throughout our history
You always have to ask "compared to what
" when making these assesments
And when you ask that, you will see that this isnt tragic but spectacular comapred to any alternative
Maybe you can dream up a scenario where it is better but making it's easy to fantasize and hard to make things work perfectly
In developed countries, they are looking for things to sell for the most part
Plastic bottles, metals
And it's not "a lot" by a long shot

It's like when that british lady jumped off from a cruiser that was on the italian-croatian sea border lol
Why
Because there is a civil debate about a political subject
A) you don't elect bureaucrats anywhere
B) the same people appointing the ones in the Netherlands have a vote in appointing the ones in Brussels
C) I'm all for giving the European Parliament more power so that the EU is more directly Democratic, but the democratically elected representatives of the people in member countries don't like the competition

BiH is a lot more complicated, through the Dayton agreement it was made as a federation of three peoples(Croats, Bosnians and Serbs)/ two states(Republika Srbska and Federaton of Bosnia and Hercegovina)
There are ethnic tension that last from the fall of Yugoslavia, some want to seceed (dk how to spell that word), a lot of corruption (newest case i remember hearing is when a patient with corona was released because he's something to a person with a high position, either in hospital or state, can't remember)
This is just sad
They didn't even do that bad something of these are ok
Not saying that these are all socialist countries hut but a lot of them have socialist elements
Left wing ones are the worst
Right wing ones seem very sane
Yap, but the same boss
To appease the socialists, by giving their members what they actually wanted
To quell the liberals and the intellectuals by separating them from the workers, because old Otto figured out that the average worker only really wanted a decent wage and some level of security and safety
Given that Prussia and the early German Reich was a Paternal monarchy, it wasn't even that hard to convince the Keiser that providing this was not only politically prudent but also his duty as the father of all Germans

Spotify is European
That's hilarious and sad at the same time, they don't even let me use their site although I'm on the same fucking continent as them
Maybe Spotify is ''European'' but it's very much oriented on the USA, considering they refuse to provide service for over half of their own continent
It's probably the same in Croatia
How big is the sample though
I have idea, why doesn't Poland and Romania replace its government with European commission so that we see how far will that experiment go
Can’t believe we almost let them into the EU
They aren’t sanctioning France, they are calling for boycotts on French products
Some Qatari supermarket chains joined the boycotts as well and they won’t sell French products any more
So if you want something reciprocal you should aim for boycotts, not sanctions
Unless you of course think that calls for boycotts validate sanctions

The Caucasus chain divides Europe from Asia

It's like those trolls you get on your team in League, and I suppose in other games, ~~in your promos~~ occasionally
They decide a game is lost at some point, could be before it even began, and if you are winning, they just decide to assist the enemy team and type about how they were right about the game being a lost cause
All while still putting all the blame on whatever they first perceived as the reason the game will be lost
Yeah, no shit we can't win 4v6 when your retarded ass is trying to ruin us
Except this is real life
And grown men and women
And I can find similarities between them and 14 year olds in my League games
What the fuck
I don't, help
These Brexit cartoons are very lame, unoriginal and generally low-quality
Have a downvote
Fuck that it’s expensive as shit in Canada
It's 25€ for up to "50mbps" (in reality it's around 4-10mbps) here in Croatia
With 2-3 maybe even 4 times smaller salary in comparison to the Netherlands
Wow, didn't know München was so high
Most of inland Croatia is 100-200 m (not the hills, of course)
Looks a bit different now
Nice :)
Nice brother :D
it looked different then
I dont think it was without scaffolding since independence
Ackchyually it's neo-Gothic
The two towers' tops are gone and one tower is under scaffolidng
We don't have Polish amount of churches
True
For about forever
I’m 25 years old and have never in my life seen it without it
The renovations should have been completed this year I believe, but now after the quake, they say we’re looking at a long time before it’s renovated
Probably 20+ more years
The scaffolding is so iconic now, I think it would actually be weird to see it without it
Because the right side was built with different kind of stone and is always falling apart, and instead of taking the whole tower down and start anew, the church likes to leech off the money needed for 'renovation' for 50 years now
They say renovations will be completed this year for every year now
Towers are built from very porous stone that gets dissolved in water and they get destroyed pretty quickly
If my memory serves me correctly they just keep changing which tower they work on
This guy is right
We usually do in fact blame Serbia for pretty much everything, but as far as I know they had nothing to do with the earthquake :)
I'm not an expert but I think the time period it was built in
Gothic architecture is from the middle ages and this was built at the end of the 19th century
It's also called gothic revival architecture:
Motherfucker, I knew it
She has the 3 same outfits just in different colors
lolgay
I'd say Soviets count as part of the allies just for ww2 though
So no hard feels for the 2018 semi finals
France beats Croatia once again :(
More people in the UK have a negative opinion about the UK than about Croatia
Despite them being better than us in football, I'd say I like France
They have decent music (especially the 80's), nice language (although their words are almost impossible to pronounce properly as their words can have 20 letters but they only pronounce like 12), and I believe they have pretty positive opinion about us as well
It is just that they are better than we are in football
Strange, one would think that after two very important and massive losses in 2008 and 2018 the average British person would know the Croatia NT very well
I guess the Irish, Welsh and Scottish were also surveyed, but I assume most were English
And yeah, the English are well known as among, if not the worst tourists in Croatia
It is regularly taught in schools, but doesn't have too much significance in everyday life as it only lasted 7 years and didn't encompass whole of Croatia
It's more of a fun fact
Considering it's late October and a pandemic, nah
The issue are mostly young people who come over in big groups thinking Croatia is a cheap party destination and then proceed to stay wasted for 90% of their stay, making a big mess of everything
They usually flock to places like Zrće so they're not that hard to avoid
We have millions of tourists every year, so you only hear about the bad stuff
I have little personal experience with British tourists since the town I live in is smaller (\~35k)
The only British tourists I ever encountered were these 2 old ladies who turned out to be the cheapest people I've ever met (paying the **exact** amount for their meal, not leaving a single lipa as tip)
Personally I dislike Italians much more than the Brits, I'm just telling you what the public opinion is like throughout the country
Cheap and stuck up
They also sometimes like letting a bit of fascism slip through (hanging italian flags in "Italian" towns, etc
you know denmark, this means war
We have been in the EU for years now
Croatia is EU member and I don't see data about it
But they are not in the EU sadly
TIL that Rusyn =\= Russian, thanks I always thought otherwise
Well I'm a big fan of Montalbano series, and usually Italians in that series call us Slavs
When that scenes play on the screen I'm laughing so hard
Ok, now I've seen everything
But have you seen a man eat his own head
Well, then you haven't seen everything
Bit ce interesantno kad to stupi na snagu
Dunno why we keep reacting like this to proposals from lobies, nowadays if you had enough money you could make a serious proposal to charge birds for using flight space .

It wasn't his dog, but the neighbors
The dog has a home and hopefully, a family that loves it
I highly doubt there was a way for the dog to see the dead body of their neighbor lol
At least knowing that it has a home where it's loved makes it a bit easier :/
I think you'll find this varies a lot from member state to member state
Ok grampa
I remember summers in Croatia with continuous weeks of over 36 every day
I remember it so well
Because it was basically 4 out of 5 last summers
Same here
Right now it's around 13°C outside, lol
If the poll asked “other than English” the number would be far lower for everyone
I can write in Bosnian
Does that count ?
Finally Croatia in the top 10 for something useful :)
And yes, we are thought either German, English or Italian (depending on the region) from first grade all the way to high school until graduation
&#x200B;
There are numerous reasons why we speak a second language
TV, music, gaming, school, family members who (have) work(ed) somewhere abroad
I don't know anyone below 40 who doesn't speak English or German to some degree and I get to meet a lot of people
Croatian and bosnian
I was expecting the Hungarian one to be lower, speaking from experience with Hungarian tourists, I've not met a single one IRL that could understand and speak English or any other language, it often made dealing with Hungarian tourists problematic for all of us living and working in the tourist heavy zones such as the coast line and islands since almost no one knows Hungarian
Idk why is it but my eyes teared up looking at this
It could be an eyegarsm

In what way exactly is it a corrupt government, what did they do
Genuinely asking, since I don't know and most news pieces talk about the protests themselves, not the cause of the protests

What's the other lake called
Death by snö snö
i would really like to know the distinction between origin of the word snoyg and snig
I mean it's kind of illogical to claim neige comes from snig, but snig doesn't, but instead comes from snoyg

858 euros in Croatia, kinda doubt that somewhat
The overall average iv'e seen regular folk earning is usually at around 500-600 euros a month back home, with the next tier being at 600-750
If you're someone back home with a job that hits 1k Euros a month or very close to that, you're pretty much a rich person in the eyes of many country folk
This is cool :)
Can we see "Net Average Monthly living costs in Europe (€)"
Portugal once again reaffirming their position as a rightful member of Central Europe
Data for Croatia is flawed: most of the people here receive minimum or slightly above minimum wage, which is then offset by the 2% who have absolutely ridiculous income
So the average is 800 something euros, but the average Joe receives maybe 450 or so
Rich my ass, I get around 1700 euros post-tax and I can't afford to buy real estate without taking a 20 year loan
I'm feeling so rich
All this map tells me is that no person in Europe who works for a salary will ever be anything close to rich
We live fine, let's not kid ourselves, IMO I don't have a lot to complain about day-to-day, but we will never be rich, at least not in time to enjoy it for long
I recently looked at some stats and it turns out I'm in the top 1% of income in the country, yet the only thing I own is my 10 year old car(which I like, to be honest), and to get a nice apartment I'd have to get a huge loan at extortionate interest like 3
5% if I'm lucky
Cue fear of losing my job and economic enslavement as soon as I'd sign the papers, yay
(I realize that to some this might sound like I'm a huge douchebag, which is possible
I'm just trying to say how sad I am that it turns out that in fact no country on Earth is actually "rich" when you look at the normal folk who work for a salary)
Brutto is before taxes, net after
Congratulations Latvia, my second favourite Baltic country
Lol you should check the Zagreb Cathedral
I must be honest and say that I prefer the way it looks now as opposed to the completed design
I feel that multitude of spires makes it look gaudy and too much
Well a lot of people other than Serbs don't know much about the Croatian nazi group called Ustaše(Ustashe) who were leading a puppet government in Croatia during WW2
Supposedly their concentration camps were much worse than any Nazi German one(btw they were mostly for Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and  people who didn't support the regime)
They also had a special concentration camp for children in Sisak
For what I know people were killed mostly with cold weapons like knives, axes, hard objects and other shit like gas
Someone told me they also used Rollers to squish people too but idk
Other dark facts about Croatia are that eastern Croatia is literally dying slowly and noone is giving a shit
We killed some serbs in ww2 and they killed some croats in croatian homeland war 1991-95
By some I mean few thousand
And both nations declined that those happened even tho croatia like indenpended country didnt exist in ww2 it was puppet state NDH
Molio bih da se nitko ne svađa u komentarima
Hvala
In Croatia, atheists have to financially support the Catholic Church via taxes that bring up to 150 million euros a year
Priests, often openly pro-Nazi, are employed in schools and hospitals
Secularity is only a sentence in the Constitution
Opposition to this in public often results in threats and intimidation
This type of shit happened in Yugoslavia mid to late 20th century
Mostly Serbia though
Wait a sec, your flair isn't Croatia
I imagine its hard to do when people who speak out against Putin end up mysteriously dead
I believe that the Boer Wars which is what they're taliking about was the first ever usage of concentration camps
Yeah cpncetration camp can refer to both internemant camps and death camps
In this case they we're used to counter guerilla warfare but the conditions in the camp we're pretty bad so lots of people died of diseases
Croatia
Easy, slovenia
Nothing against our neighbours but that would make our coastline even more awesome
The whole country would be a peninsula
We'd lose in tourism tho because austrians would get the sea and all the germans would probably wanna go there instead of here but fuck it
#worthit
Or france just for the fun of it and make europe an archipelago
Serbi
oh you said EU only
Damn
Slovenian coastline finally expands from 2 km into 3
(jk love you neighbours)

Don't worry, Germany will be killed off by their own stupid politicians and demographics
I'd prefer Serbia be gone, I could take a boat to Kosovo
I thought we were friends :(
As a Croatian, I am very saddened by this thread

like we don't have enough problems on our own
also, the UK isn't a big enough global player to affect me in any way
once they leave the EU, following their politics would be just as ridiculous as following Chilean politics
Okay yeah his politics are shit but no he's not Trump
Brexit is happening so we might as well have someone who campaigned in favor of it do it, so that Brexiters can't moan forever that they've been backstabed and got the wrong kind of brexit
Fighting in 1848 to get rid of Hungarian domination just to be returned to it in 1868
Krbava Battle
The ottoman army demanded they pass trough the Croat territory without conflict
Croats said f\*ck it and attacked them in the open field
Lost almost all of our nobility in that battle
The entire history after the hungarians
I would say union with Hungary started it all in 1102
Wasn't the guy actually competent ruler, so much that Montenegrins didn't want him to leave when they discovered he was a liar ?
That would make him an impressive chad
What makes it even worse that the guy leading the whole thing (Emerik Derenčin) could've just ambushed the Turks and be done with it, but he was like "Nah, that's not honorable"
Kinda
I don't know if we broke all ties with them in 1527
Croatian intellectuals had the similiar liberal wishes like Hungarian ones except that they were less decisive to declare ouright independence and Hungarian nationalism was seen as bigger threat
Anyway, Croats didn't like to fight for the crown just so they be can returned to Hungarian rule (although pro-Hungarian Croatian nobility had their hands in it too)
Living in a cold, poorly managed, uncomfortable looking farm house made of concrete
Yes, in buildings like this:
Those apartments were built for young families and were sold for 1000 eur/m2, apartments in normal new buildings in Zagreb usually cost 2-4k eur/m2 and they're located in better neighbourhoods and they are built way better
Yeah but you can be middle class and still live in a concrete commie building, in the Ex-Yu commie blocks are a sign of quality ( big wide streets, lots of parks, comfy buildings
New apartment buildings look more socialist than those built 40 years ago
Well a lot of our Yugoslav apartment blocks are kinda nice, this is Dugave neighbourhood in Zagreb, built 40 years ago:
Nowdays it looks even better because of tall trees
No but as someone working in a field where everything is in english and it is de facto lingua franca, looking for terms in native language is such a pain
As someone who moved to Germany last year, this kinda sound like my colleague from Schwaben
I don't like it at all
I hold a great dislike toward my accent
Well thank you for making me feel nice for 2 seconds
But I'll still dislike it
Well iPhone is much more expensive here, and it's just a phone
I've wondered that as well
I use Android, I knew it will be my choice before I got my first smartphone because I tried both and just preferred Android look and feel
I used Symbian phone before my Android, and didn't switch until it stopped working
I wasn't even aware of the large price difference then
That being saidy the entire iPhone vs Android thing is so childish and ridiculous
Only recently (iPhone 11) did Apple start to market a bit more than usual
Still not _nowhere near as much_ as Samsung and Huawei
Also, the 11 pro max costs $1700
There are no Apple stores in Croatia, only licensed sellers
I think this where you can use the phrase ''stupid americans''
We mostly buy our phones and service plans separately
Also, we don't see iPhone being good value for money
Some of us are irritated by the closed ecosystem
That's definitely an Android advantage, I really appreciate the freedom of choice
>my Samsung S9+
>Also the camera blows any Apple phone out of the water
Honestly baffled by these replies
Android users saying iPhone users don't know anything about tech and then they say shit like this
iPhone 11 definitely has a better camera than the S10 according to
everyone
So I don't know how you possibly could think that your S9 is better
> but do windows computers and androids even connect to each other
I've never heard of anything that connects them
Yes, they do
I mean, Microsoft ditched Windows Phone (and Windows 10 Mobile) because it was a disaster and decided to stick with Android
Their dual screen phone, [Surface Duo] will come with Android too
Beside that, Windows 10 even comes with the app called [Your Phone] It basically enables you to see everything from your phone right on the PC
You can send SMS via PC, receive notifications, make and recieve calls, and more
i've got a feeling that americans are really shallow when it comes to phones
and i got this feeling just by seeing shit on reddit and nothing else so maybe i'm way off
anyways, i feel like a phone is a way of showing off while here it's considered as a helpful gadget and nothing else
people don't care which phone you have other than "your phone makes shitty photos, let's use mine". i mean we have other things which we're shallow about, for example cars
people really like to show off their german made cars around here but phones, yeah, nobody cares
also, i'm talking about grown ass men, kids in school probably care about their phones
you always have to be special, don't you
Split, I know it has the palace and very nice sea and a lot more but when I came tourists were everywhere and the palace it self wasn't special at all and stores were everywhere even in the palace
Also when I first came in an old woman took a dump in the trash like wth
But I gave it the benefit of the doubt since a lot of my friends actually like Split so I guess I either went to the wrong places or I was just too distracted from seeing the dump
Also Hajduk signs were everywhere even graffiti style prayers for the club on the churches but I guess they really like their team so whatever I guess
How would you describe Aarhus
Just curious because I'm moving there soon
lolol about the dump wow
What town or region are you from
Just curious
Belišće Slavonia :D
Haha
Ok I can see that being a bit of a culture shock
I’m from Istra
not all of us coastal ppl are shitting in the garbage
That's actually how people think of you

When I was in high school, my classmate (who was always late) used the excuse that the tram he was in had an uncontained fire and burnt down which was obviously bullshit
Funnily enough, the very next day he was late again and it turned out the tram he was in actually caught on fire and had to be evacuated
Newly employed secretary who just can't seem to stop trying to suck up to Germany in every concievable way
We are the President of the Board, and we run the company via zoom calls only
We will continue to do zoom calls by July 30
We don't really know why we run zoom calls so much, but we do know we will stop July 30
It will then be Germany's problem, not ours
The Ey-Yugoslav countries would be the ones who constantly complain about his office neighbours to the chief, but they hang out with each other at every coffee break
Hungary is buying guns and they probably want a coastline
Well you never know, and I said it more as a joke but since Orban is now almost a dictator you can expect anything
Noone knows if NATO would intervene in a conflict in central europe maybe they would just let it go like the UN sometimes
Well democracy in Hungary is kind of nonexistent at the time and other countries are doing similar things like Hungary with direct control(totalitarianism) and dictatorship like Poland or Finland and USA is kind of in a pickle with the corona thing so it is a perfect opportunity for democracies to crumble and wars to pop up
The same thing happened before WW2(democracies crumbling not a pendemic) so the world may enter some conflicts soon but maybe not
Haha hope not a nuclear WW3 and this is not confirmed to be clear I said maybe
Wow I didn't know he said that
fuck
Well, old-sounding are probably male names ending with -slav or -mir, and depending on preceding word they can vary from popular (Tomislav, Miroslav, Krešimir, Branimir) to archaic (Držislav, Višeslav, Vojnomir, Trpimir)
For female names I would go with Buga, Kata/Katica, Slava/Slavica
But for really archaic names, pretty much nonexistent in circulation, one must simply look at the catholic calendar with patron saints and pick one (Eleuterije, Krescencije)
Gvozden and Dragomila I think
Janja - Croatia
If Bolek is shortened for Boleslav, what is Lolek short for
similar in croatian
Male names are glorious sounding and sometimes even usable/used
Females are just weird
Inga is a rare name here but not considered old, huh
wait, Gervais is a proper name
We have streets named after a poet whose surname was Gervais
Now I can only dream of meeting Gervais Gervais
I know a bunch of Kata/Katica of all ages, although Slavica's are usually women in their 50's or older
It's funny to me that you can even combine the suffixes for more names
Branimir and Miroslav are two well-known names in Croatia
Radislav and Branislav also exist, we just need a Slavislav now :P
Is Srbobran really used as a name
PS I know only one Miodrag who is neither mio (kind) or drag (nice)
Is Uroš an archaic name ?
all ruza/ruzica, jagoda, visnja, malina etc are old women in their 60s at least
I cant think of young ruza
I know maybe a handfull of them, and all of them are 70+.
They are originally mostly names of kings or other rulers since those are the names that were perserved (Im not sure if we know any common folk names from 10th century or so - I know there was a monk named Držiha though)
Well, some of them are now maybe a bit old-fashiony
For example, while I know several Tomislav under 30, most Miroslavs are 50+ men
Some are pretty much nonexistent in modern times (Trpimir, Vojnomir etc
I think it mostly comes from such names being "long" when compared to most names that are popular now, or still popular such as Luka, Filip, Marko, Tin, Leo, Ivan
Same thing with girls
I was tutoring, and 90% of students were included in Ana, Lana, Lara, Lea, Mia, and Iva
At the same time, Kristina, Katarina or Mirjana, which are more traditional names are getting rare
Others won't understand why it's kinda funny
Those Poles and their crazy language :P
IMO Katica and Slavica are not "ancient" sounding like Beowulf but more along the lines "someone born between 1880 and 1960" lol
Janja is uncommon in my part of Croatia, but I would say it falls into the same category of an old-fashioned name
its not, by by by Earth, but its by, by humans
Croatia has the smallest town in the world, Hum, located in Istria
According to Alfred Hitchcock, the city of Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world
Croatia enjoys 2715 hours of sunshine per year and the island of Hvar is the sunniest place in Europe
We have 1246 islands, isles and imlets
Some of our most recognizable inventions are: necktie, torpedo, pen, suspension bridges, dactyloscopy, electric speedometer
Bonus fact: Croatia is home to the Walls of Ston, 2nd largest preserved forticifation system, right after the Great wall of China
Romania is by far the most underrated country for tourism
I can actually pronoumce the name of that village
After peactice :D
Also Kopacki Rit one of the last preserved swamp systems in Europe and Papuk which is also a geopark because when the pannonian sea existed Papuk was an island and now has unique mountain structure seen nowhere else in the world, and the great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth was born in Osijek(city in Croatia) . Just wanted to put some inland stuff  because people usually talk about the coastline
Awesome
Slavonia is usually ignored by tourist since our coastline is much more attractive, but it's actually really beautiful with lots of places that are worth a visit
Laszlo Biro invented the ballpoint pen, but Slavoljub Penkala invented the mechanical/automatic pencil which was later developed into a fountain pen
I go there every summer since my grandparents live on the southern coast of the island
God forbid I forget to put on sunscreen
I'm sorry, hwat
Yes
Tesla was an inventor
Not a scientist
It is a shameyou guys don't really have highways and railroads for what I heard but I really wanna go to Transylvania because you know caatles and stuff
Also beatiful towns and cities and I'm pretty close too like a 5h drive to Timisoara which is not in Transylvania but still a nice city too
Well yes Slavonia can't compare with Dalmatia in beauty only in cuisine(Slavonia has far better food-change my mind) but yes some places are worth a visit especially geothermal springs and castles whom are also in Slavonia but also in Zagorje
Communists are still ruling the country from the shadows by controlling both the main left wing and right wing party is more widespread belief than people like to admit
That, and also that the war (ended 25 years ago) and socialism and Yugoslavia (ended 30 years ago) and Tito (died 40 years ago) are to blame for everything bad that is going on today
And millions of Muslims want to live in Hungary, nowhere else
[And the map is ready
Croatia, too
Just yesterday we had a debate on our sub about it
One guy said Soros has a dark ulterior motive with all donations and scholarships, but doesn’t know what it is
Reading this thread thinking me "what penis
" :D
There certainly interesting examples, but that is difficult actually communicating
Think that is Croatian, as and other slavic languages, very efficient, because can say same amount of information in less words
(For example that sentence when in english is missing couple of layers, about the subject and object of the sentence
"Literally not much would change
You can to speak completely normally because infinitive, even though sound farmer-like little
" Yeah, this is bad haha
Never didn't think that will this be so fun, but and difficult
"German is so weird sometimes
You want to speak but you sound like Russian that tries to speak English
Then write in \[the\] naturalest order for your language
Don't know, think yes sometimes could work
Depends from the situation
Fucking answer
This with penis is law
It really me laugh
Or both, honestly
Glad to me that I found croatians in thread
Worried myself that wouldn't be able to find anyone, because really wanted to see some examples on croatian
Funny to me is that you first mentioned penis, very typical for us
I know, slavic languages are generally like that ;)
Precisely, even though me is more dear swearword "fuck your dog mother". It seems me as if English lacks adequate swearwords
But, this sound as if write someone who is had brain stroke
Pfff, we lost to slovenia but i really hope we'll lose all the games and end up dead last
That's a nice way to protest it
And a nice way to send some other teams to the WC for the first time like gibraltar, cyprus, andorra and maybe san marino
Who knows
Well of course
It's simple reciprocity in international law

Gotta also give credit to that guy (you can tell me who it is, I only saw a clip online) that said "The death rate is low, but for those who die, the death rate is 100%"
Lol, I don't know him, but I saw a parody song about him done by JOE called "Because I Got High" and I thought it was just a joke about his appearance and that it can't have been true
But he publicly admitted
Ajoj
Mi smo isprva mislili da smo se usrećili s našim ljudima, koji su isprva djelovalo neobično sposobno

Definetly in Croatia cars are faster than trains lmao it takes around 6 and a half hours to get from the easternmost point to Zagreb and it takes 3
5 with a car(something like 230 km)
"Overencumbered". As you might imagine, I saw it in a video game
My first game was Diablo II where "overburdened" was used so I thought that's the only word for it
I initially read the other one as "overcucumbered" and thought it was just a silly in-game expression until I saw it in another game and read it properly, haha
Wait that's not how you pronounce it
Have you seen those warriors from Hammerfell
They've got curved swords
Curved
Swords
Not really
Germans are probably one of the most well-liked and respected people here
Austrians too
When you say Slavic you can count Balkans out because germany is the light at the end of the tunnel for us
No its not its opposite we love germans most of us
Nah we croats love you because our people are leaving our country to go live in yours (money)
Not really, but, sadly, there are still Croatians who associate with the idea of Nazism
There are not a lot of them, but they are pretty radical
That's why a lot of people are terrified to come here
Also, when someone comes they immediately notice the swastikas and Nazi chants written on the walls, especially near football stadiums
Pretty sad
But when you ask about today's Germans, we have stereotypes like for every other people
They are not necessarily anti-German, but they do exist
I just learned Kinder is from Italy and not from Germany
Are there any other brand to country mismatches you have had
F1 fans know it
We actually have some connection, Dieter Mateschitz (Matešić) is of Croatian origin
Wait, isn't red bull from Thailand
Wait, what
It is going bad for us because of our demography, lots of old people, so we end up having less money for the healthcare system which is currently in debt
Because we are in the EU our medical professionals have a tendency of leaving the country for better pay and work conditions
if i remember, NY first fire brigade was private and i saw story where they were arranging price for puting out fire while the house was on fire
shortly after they made them city care
same was with Pinkerton agency
What everyone seems to forget is that the U.S. is a huge federal republic, with enormous differences between states
Some states are like Sweden, but many states are similar to poorest EU members
Providing Sweden-like quality universal health care to the whole USA would be like if EU provided highest quality insurance to all member states, which is not the case
Each European country has their own universal healthcare and the quality varies massively
However, I'm sure that most people still prefer it instead of american-like system
Maybe the correct path for the US would be that each state comes up with their own universal healthcare, instead of waiting for the federal government to figure out how to deploy Sweden-like healthcare to some of their states which are equivalents of Croatia/Hungary/Bulgaria/etc
I would (and do) drink tap water pretty much anywhere in the country
idk everyone i know drinks tap water infact people usally by bottled water or a soda drink it and then when they are going somewhere they take the empty bottle and fill it with water from the tap
Absolutely
In Croatia tap water is perfectly safe to drink
If I buy bottled water at home it’s only if it’s sparkled
Except in Split after a heavy rain
I live in Ireland but i am from BiH/Cro
There is a reason we dont pay for the water in Ireland, **i dont drink it** ,only if i run out of bottled one
Bosnian Water is way cleaner than Any of these county's, and Croatian is drinkable
Being a politican or owner of a company and not stealing from everyone you can
Or when entering the bus
Say hello to the driver
Wow, didn't know this was a thing outside the Balkans
Based Nordics
The first paragraph gives me great enjoyment
This is why we love Italians
Let me guess, when they finally sit down, they complain about how everything hurts and aches
Sounds oddly familiar
Tru dat
Poland can't into space, but it can into Ireland
That doesn't mean they're the least chauvinistic
In general the ex-Yougoslavian states are pretty tolerant of other races its other balkan people that prople here can't stand
Nah hate here just isn't based on race its based on nationality or religion
They or they parents were in the war
People need time, wounds caused by atrocities of war dont heal that fast
Honestly, it varies a lot from person to person
Over here the stereotype is that people who left to work in other countries either remain/become completely chill and indifferent towards the old issues, or they become the biggest nationalists around
I’m not kidding when I say that the biggest extreme nationalists tend to be expats or their children, longing for a magical perfect homeland that never existed in the first place
The confusing thing is that most of them left because things were economically shit, so I can’t really understand that comical level of romanticism
Really stabbing
I mean croatia and serbia have shit amount of unregistered weapons on both sides and never heard of incident similar to stabbing
Also in Croatia situation is mostly normal, excet maxbe in eastern slavonia
Well eastern Slavonia around Vukovar and Vukovar itself is a breathing ground for nationalists but other parts of Slavonia are mostly ok except maybe a few places like Voćin or some parts of Baranja
The joke in Zagreb tends to be that when we hear thunder or the sirens are blaring (as part of maintenance), “the Slovenes are sending an elite bycicle brigade from Maribor”.
I never knew Voćin is probčematic
Yeah rest of slavonia, kordun, banija are pretty ok these days
I mean it's been 25 years, both serbs and croats marry again among each other
I'm not saying it's not possible, indeed it is
I think these are mostly rural folks
However I witnessed stabbing between albanians and croats if that counts
I think girl was in question
I think you never heard of a place called Balkans
Half of Croats were in partisans, half in Homeguard and some in Ustashe forces
Serbs in either Chetnik forces or Partisans
Until 1943
you had a clusterfuck with good saying * Ne zna se tko pije a tko plaća* in eng
* You don't know who is drinking and who is paying for it*. By the 1943
Ustashe regime was backed by nazi germany and italy, chetniks officially by Allied powers but unoffiacially had Riotta's strategic and areal help and you had partisans backed by red army which in initial years couldn't help herself let alone partisans
Well Vocin had that genocide and they are naturally very sensitive about it and there are also still some Serbs in the area
I rarely stumble on some regional content on the internet without seeing comments about the war, whose politicians are crazier, or who does Tesla belong to
Interesting thing is, I have never met someone from Serbia in person that wasn't a totally cool person that doesn't give two shits about these topic
Been in Belgrade 3 times, mostly normal people, just don't talk about war, that's it
Eat, drink, have a great time
Spot on
I used to live in northern Germany for a couple of years and was severely depressed
Just a month of being in my hometown on the coast made me feel a lot better both in mind and body
The sea and coast are magic
It is the same for coastal Croatia
Very true
Except for the Scandinavian folk
They're monsters
Hearing that from a spanish person is indeed high praise :)
For real
Whenever I go visit home breathing in that sea air gives me a nice high
The fucking state of it all when you think not getting executed in public is good enough
In Croatia we do pranks when we can and want
But we do have a tradion at the end of the 4th year (12th grade) where students who graduated high school take part in a huge graduation parade and party, called "Norijada". The parade has caused controversies over the past few years because incidents such as causing fires, getting arrested, vadalising properties etc
have become a common occurrence
But it is also a lot of fun since rearly anyone gets injured, students spray eachother with water guns and pistols (mostly pouring alcochol in it instead of water), throw flour and eggs at eachother, blow whistles REALLY LOUD, dance, sing and parade (occupy) the entire cities and towns (traffic usually collapses during that time of the day)
Zar se to ne zove Ludi Dan
Nikad nisam čula za naziv "Norijada" niti da je to parada
Ne, Norijada je naziv za to
Ja nikada nisam cuo za "Ludi dan". Odakle si uopce, s obale negdje
Jer ja sam iz Slavonije
Cak i u Zagrebu kazu Norijada
A sto se dijela parade tice
to je zapravo parada samo u Zagrebu, jer idu nekom rutom ne znam tocno kojom
Toga kod nas nema
Jok, nisam s obale
Dobra stara regija Banija,nedaleko od Siska
Nezz, kod mene tu je Ludi Dan, i u mom gradu, i u Sisku i cijeloj okolici
Oce to tako kod nas u Hrvatskoj
Svako selo svoj dijalekt/naglasak
Haha Jbg eto sad znamo oboje da ima vise naziva za to
Apsolutely, in smaller towns it is completely normal to say hi to everyone on the streets
Yeah
It's also nice to do it in rural areas
But if the hiking trail is too busy, it can become boring
Yes, definetly
People do it all the time when hiking on Sljeme
We usually have a little (forced) chat with them
"Hello"
"Hi"
"How's things
"Good"
"Good
*Stare at each other awkwardly*
"Well I better get going"
"Yeah, me too"
Is it wrong to use "hallo" in Austria
My german is limited to basics like asking for directions, ordering food and having simple conversations and everytime I was in some shop or elsewhere I greeted cashiers/staff with hallo and one time some old lady looked at me like I've just murdered someone
Drinking coffee on a nearby terrace during work hours
It is considered that you are an important and successful person if you can spend a large part of your daily work drinking coffee in a local pub that usually has a terrace because the point is to be seen
During that time (that is no less than 2 hours) your friends come and change around your table, you usually pay the bill for the ones you appreciate and themes vary from plain gossip about certain people to open political activism
Also, very popular topics are deciding who should and who shouldn't play in a national football team, various local sexual affairs and getting services from various people
If some bigger task arose or you have to treat someone with respect for what they did for you, then the jolly boys switch to the restaurant with lamb or pork meat to seal their friendship
Often, it is not about coffee, you can order a small glass of tap beer, "gemišt" (white wine with sparkling water), Jaegermeister or something stronger
It is very important for your social and professional life and is a must-do for local businessmen, public servants, managers and so on
Information rules the world and around those tables, most horrifying secrets are revealed, and the smartest philosophical concepts constructed
Is it like an Obelix situation there, just like he fell into a pot of that strength potion when he was a kid which made him strong his entire life
A Greek baby is dipped in olive oil and can now forever cook or grow magnificent food forever
We have Krampii as well
We have him in Croatia also, although that makes sense
I’m having panic attack just thinking about it
Spanish people kiss and during introductions with complete strangers
Had very unfortunate incident involving a kiss, a finger and an eye
Gemischt
Well, the Croatian language is full of Germanisms
Before this americanization, Croatia was culturally connected with the German-speaking part of Europe
Part of Austria-Hungary
My grandma used to read German books in gothic letters, yet we are not Germans
It's nice if you're in that company, it's cringe for everone around them
She has heels, too
Maybe he should switch to Buldožer immediately
Or Pankrti
Or some other band/author, hell now I remember them all, one by one, even Pepel in kri
OK, I'll start with Navihanke
Don't worry, it was and is all nice, I like Slovenia
Cheers
Sretan Božić! :)
Sretan Božić i sretna Nova godina
“K’o Rusa i Kineza zajedno”.
You say this if there are a lot of people at one place, i.e. like Russians and Chinese combined
"Ružan ko Turčin" - "You are ugly like a Turk"
"Lažeš ko Srbin"- "You lie like a Serb"
"Pušiš ko Turčin" - "You smoke like a Turk"
"Točan ko Švicarski sat" - "As precise as a Swiss watch" it means that you are right on time
In Croatian we have “špansko selo”, translated as Spanish village
It’s used when you want to say you have absolutely no clue about the topic
Not sure about the etymology, though
Same here, except we use "wild west" instead
Yes its people from Istria and Dalmatia(can understand them more then Istrians) we speak Croatian but bro its hard to understand them
how do you use đ in a unique way
i kinda wanna know
ah i see
"You are going to live under a bridge" or "If you don't get an education you are gonna work in agriculture" this one is one of the reasons why Croatian agriculture is failing
Every male kid wanted to probably
it's funny that this thread has turned mostly into "what americans thought about my country that was wrong" ://
Hey, why do you have Croatian and Slovenian flag and Istria in your flair
I mean forcing parents to feed their children is techically forcing substances into that child
Do you support legalising starving a child until they're dead
Good luck tracing which anti vaxxer gave you the flu a month before
In addition, when herd immunity breaks down there is a higher chance of virus mutating (because it reproduces drastically more)
Eventually one of those mutations is different enough that it can infect vaccinated people as well, because it is no longer the same virus
Makes sense
There isnt a natural desire for vaccinations, there's a desire to not die of a fucking disease though
We have "typical" translation errors in restaurant menus
It's not that hard to find automatic translations such as "pasta s kozicama" which should be pasta with prawns" translated as "pasta with chickenpox" since name for that particular disease is "(vodene) kozice". There are a couple of other "usual" ones
handjobs are standard cheap/poor translations for any hand made stuffs (souvenirs, food, items, jewelery
) that is sold to tourists since its a direct translation of croatian term (ručni rad)
For us this is actually pretty normal
Though we haven't yet gottento summer summer temperatures (apparently its gonna be getting to 40C)
Ive been bracing myself fro then
It’s all fine here
It is a bit hot sometimes but a week or two ago it was freezing cold with terrible whether
It's not that bad
Just remember us in cooler times after we're all gone
its finally summer here
We had overcast and rainy weather for weeks now
Pretty much the weather inversly correlates with covid
When its nice outside you cabt go due to virus
Then when restrictions get lifted the weather sicks
Yes, die
Yeah
It was so weird that when last year it was sunny and crazy hot, now it’s raining and cold
And now it’s warm when it should be much warmer
You see bosnia espacially is a very spicy situation
We see ourselves as bosnian croats coz' we're not from croatia so we aren't croats
But ethnically speaking we're not bosnians either
At the other hand everyone from bosnia kinda is generally speaking a bosnian but "bosnian" splits into bosnian croat, bosniak and bosnian serb
Tho the bosniaks are most likely to refer to themselves as bosnians
Bosniaks are Muslims from bosnia (they make up like 45% of the population) so that's what differanciates them from bosnian croats/-serbs
Bosnian croats-/serbs are just serbs/croatians born on the Territory of Bosnia and Hercegovina
I hope this wasn't all to confusing but it probably is
Then the 2nd thing: i was born and live in switzerland
So in my home-canton (region) im the croat, but in other cantons i'm the dude from "my homecanton"
Oh my god, i found one in the wild
Good for you man
I read a couple of days ago about a pro boxer from herzegovina who refused to fight under croatian flag because he's bosnian
Thats how it should be
I lived in sarajevo until the war, first 6 years of my life, and then i moved to croatia
Now i feel croatian because i grew up here, bosnia is just another neighbouring country to me
In Croatia it might be Glina
Its more of a town, rather than a city, but people think its disgusting
I have never been there, so I can't really confirm
Also, glina in Croatian litteraly means clay
Of bigger cities i would sadly say Rijeka
Its industrial/port town with lots of derelict and abandoned industrial sites in the centre and right by the coast
Our tour guide said Mestre was the ugliest city in Italy and the people there knew it
Article 1
The Republic of Croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic and social state
Power in the Republic of Croatia derives from the people and belongs to the people as a community of free and equal citizens
The people exercise the power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making
This is the first article of the constitution, but before the first article we have a preamble that talks about the historical fundations for a sovereign Croatian state
**ARTICLE I.**
>The Republic of Croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic and social state
In the Republic of Croatia, power comes from the people and belongs to the people as a community of free and equal citizens
The people exercise power by electing their representatives and direct decision-making
**ČLANAK I.**
>Republika Hrvatska jedinstvena je i nedjeljiva demokratska i socijalna država
U Republici Hrvatskoj vlast proizlazi iz naroda i pripada narodu kak zajednici slobodnih i ravnopravnih državljana
Narod ostvaruje vlast izborom svojih predstavnika i neposrednim odlučivanjem
I've heard a russian youtuber (NFKRZ) call the Russian constitution the greatest work of fiction ever written
Probably the Slavonia region, people left the area during the war, most of them never came back
The mountainous regions
They're mostly small villages with old townfolk because everyone from there is migrating to the more developed regions
That we had a pretty neat kingdom back in 10th century and didn't just appear as a nation out of the blue in 20th century
I was kinda expecting you would mention the coupe from a couple of years ago
Not to be pedantic but this is askeurope
It's not like you mentioned anything relevant to understanding of the development of any historical events
It's funny how hungarians always act as if there weren't any other nations trapped in the Habsburg monarchy
It's not like Croatia wasn't your 'colony' for many centuries
I excepted for Montenegro the fact that they were in war with Japan for about 100 years but this is also very interesting
That on its own makes it interesting
That too lol
You don't get to cry for being an imprisoned nation while imprisoning another one yourself
This might be a bit too far but in dalmatian dialetct you can almost have a conversation with only a,e,i,o,u.
other slavic languages have it for sure, but i like how there are 3 different words for "where" in croatian
gdje - vanilla "where", current location
kamo - "where" in the context of destination
kuda - "where" in the context of direction
I mean Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian are the same,so not much
But Croatian has 3 dialects,the first one shtokavian is the official language  (more-less tho it still has some words and style of speaking that aren't in the official language) spoken in the east and south(those subdialects are also different) , second one is kajkavian mostly Croatian-Slovenian but unintelligible sometimes too,it has its own words and speech accents and it is mostly spoken in northern/central Croatia
The last one is chakavian and only spoken in Istria, islands and some of continental Croatia
It is the smallest one and usually now spoken with only older people
It's basically Croatian with an Italian mix added to it
In Croatian, when saying "the two ^(or ^any ^other ^quantity) of you" , we can specify wether the people we're referring to are all male, female or mixed
Vas dvojica - the two of you (guys)
Vas dvoje - the two of you (mixed)
Vas dvije - the two of you (girls)
There are also other interesting characteristics in the Croatian language, but this was the first one to come to my mind
the only random thing i know about danish is your insane way of counting
You think french is weird, danish is out there miles beyond
Do you really use it in everyday speech
We also have super specific names for family relations (some of which you had to learn in elementary school IIRC) but they are rarely used
For example, we have "šukun" and "čukun djed", and I honestly can't remember which "tier" of grandfather they are
I know what "šurjak" means (sister's husband), but I would literally never use it because I don't want to sound like a 70 year old grandpa
If my uncle called me a "sinovac" I would get really irritated
Especially here in Dalmatia I mostly just call everyone (except my ancestors and siblings) either teta, barba (those two go for non-blood related people too, especially if I knew them from childhood and also as a generic term for unknown adult) or rođak
For example I can't remember anyone calling their firs cousins (uncle/aunt's children) by anything other than just "rođak". The only ones used semi regularly are the names for spouses parents, and children's spouses, but even then mostly in "mother-in-law" jokes
also "odakle" - where in the context of starting location or direction (Where are you from
Also, we have different names for months
Namely:
Siječanj, Veljača, Ožujak, Travanj, Svibanj, Lipanj, Srpanj, Kolovoz, Rujan, Listopad, Studeni, Prosinac
And I guess we have a lot of Slavic and/or Latin/ancient Greek words, since the standard Croatian language uses only words that are of these origins
For example, using a word that has roots in the German or English language would be incorrect and you'd have to find another word that has roots in the aforementioned ones
But that's just a fun fact, I guess lol
I feel like basque language would like to have a few words with you ;)
hey, croatians do that too
We even have songs written entirely in satrovacki
Btw, i have never heard someone use žili as a verb
Croatian is much more precise than the other two you mentioned
Yes, it does sound similar and we can understand each other, but saying that it's the same language is a bit of a stretch
Perhaps you didn't notice it or you were born in the 80s, but Croatian language puts much more emphasis on maintaining order inside the language
It actually has rules (not just grammatical wise) that you need to follow and the sentence structure is different
The other two are much more flexible when it comes to word choice, phrasing, etc
Saying that it's the same language deprives it of its own uniqueness and the effort that scholars of the Croatian language put into making it sound good and "rich". (As well as that of the other aforementioned languages)
Yeah I know
I think Czech as well
I study english and have to say that that's completely not true
( Think sentence structure wise
) Also, everything is political
Wait how does it work exactly in Slovenian
In Croatian its 1 stol, 2 stola, 3 stola, 4 stola and for 5 and above it's stolova
Oh okay, got it, yeah we have a special plural for 2-4 and then one for 5+
Neither
Both have downsides that, for me, are worse than that 20 days of mild inconvenience twice a year
Long dark winter mornings or early dark summer evenings
If I absolutely must pick one, then summer time, I guess
So you like oversleeping more of the daylight so you can have night come sooner
Shit, I wish I had a biorhythm like that
Dubrovnik (small city in the southern Croatia, former Ragusa Republic) completely banned slavery in 1416
That was 76 years before Columbus discovered US
EDIT: more info, if anyone is interested -
We take coffee brakes with friends for at least 3 hours and our work time is maybe one of the best in the world but I haven't checked(heard some rumors) . Quality of life is something that Croats like more than money
We hold the world record for the biggest popcorn and tge biggest neck tie
The necktie was made in Croatia and the guinness world record for the larggest necktie was made by Zoran Stankovic 18 October 2003 it was 808 metre(s), and the dalmatian dog's are from Dalmacija Croatia
Poles are therefore one of the two nations that can use the N-word freely
The other one being Montenegrins
While Croatia had war
That might be the thing I like the most about balkan and it's countries
I love hanging out for hours and eating meza
Everyone's hospitality is really wholesome to me
People think we just fight and cause ruckus (usually the ones who hate on eachother are the uneducated and the old that are passing it down onto other generations)
Otherwise we are quite similar and don't really start fights or something like that
Love from Croatia
Yes
We banned dragons last year, though
My bad
I basically just copied the title of the article
You stop consuming and they will stop producing
(oil consumption per capita of sweden is 3x of albania)
I might be a bit biased but a shrunken version of the Balkans
Lots of drugs, crime and corruption
An extremely varied and beautiful landscape and culture with the Mediterranean, Central European, Eastern European and Middle Eastern influence
The recent war which has people arguing politics and beliefs and due to the financial situation everyone is doing something illegal
Also having an American protagonist calling it Yugoslavia in modern times would be a fun stereotype of an ignorant American who still thinks that country exists
Naples or 90's St
Petersburg
Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade on the same map
Like GTA SA
You got football fan gangs, immigrant smugglers, drug labs, muttualy hating nationalities
All that good stuff
Palermo was my first thought as well
Also running red lights is pretty GTA-realistic
Also Niko Belić from GTA IV
Usually if you see a restaurant in the main street in city centre it's usually a trap
And especially if you see a guy infront of it trying to get people to come inside
It's albanian own 100%. Nothing against them but if you want to try traditional food you won't get it there
I'm talking about coastal towns, especially istrian ones
Zagreb is completely different, for example
There are a bunch of cool restaurants in zagreb centre
Old town of Dubrovnik
It is completely overrun by tourists and has lost it's charm because every single local resident has moved out of the old houses just for airbnb/hostels
It's just overpriced restaurants and cafes now surrounded by an amazing-looking fortress and walls
Probably the bigger towns on the coast like Split, Trogir and especially Dubrovnik
I personaly wasn't in Dubrovnik and I hope this isn't true but I heard that the main street Stradun has coffee with the price of 50 kuna (around 8 dollars) and the food like a normal pizza for 150kuna(around 65 dollars) which is an astronomic price compared to normal Croatian prices and in Zagreb the Tkalčićeva street is just a bunch of bars and restaurants that mostly are super expensive
Dubrovnik and the oldtown of Split (Diocletians palace)
In my humble opinion, very great destination indeed, with interesting sights and tales to tell, but any destination could be only so much crowded to be enjoyable
I'm quite sure that citizens of Dubrovnik are in a way relieved that nobody is coming this summer
I sure would enjoy walking the streets of my hometown without swimming in crowds of people (as I did this week)
Mass tourism in general seems like a big issue in Europe that not many are talking about
It's affecting local population big time and destroying famous landmarks
When I was in London around 10 years ago we planned on going there but the fare was way too fucking expensive so instead we went to the nearby Star Wars experience/convention thingy
That was so much fun
From the outside it looks amazing, from the inside it's quite boring imo
>Orbán claimed it for himself
He did WHAT
Lol there's so many of them that when we went there we even stopped noticing, wasn't even funny later
Lol
>trying to erase communist traditions
Yes, having an office within neo-Ghotic Austria-Hungarian building from the start of the 20th century, very communist indeed
It's petty either way and I doubt that it really "had to go". It's not like Hungary has a lot of democratic traditions to which it can return to anyway
What you told me sounds like just another way to wash more money and make the supreme leader feel even more comfortable and established
I don't drink alcohol and I don't enjoy summer or swimming in the sea
I regularly squat, even on a chair, and I like football
I have my own rakija, prefered coffee is turkish style
Played water polo
Go to the front page of this sub and you'll see three dots in the up right corner
When you click you can see the change user flair option
Not a good example on the whole, but I've heard Antony Hopkins's Romanian at the beginning of 1992 Dracula is pretty good
Niko is a popular Crotian name
Some Romanian was spoken in Captain America: Winter Soldier as well, no
The actor who plays Bucky Barnes is Romanian, IIRC
Silly Turks dont know that god is a Serb
Yeah
not sure if joking
Those types of jokes get real pretty quick in this area of the map
Don't be scared, Thats where I keep all my candy
We need to figure something out
The elections and the anti-lukashenko protests were mentioned, along with short background on him and how results are questionable
It was like 3rd news from world section, after corona and tanker oil spil in mauritius and before fire in czechia
But more or less it wasnt presented as a big deal and I doubt most people have any opinion about it one way or another
nah nfkrz needs to make a video abou that
i only remember hearing there were protests in serbia and bulgaria(idk if those are still happening)
Honestly, the entire health system
If I were there I would have no idea if to go to hospital, how much anything would cost etc
Fast food has been in Europe for awhile
I dont know if you think of mcdonalds as fast food or local private business like kebab or cevapi vendors
>The best advice is to get a hobby and meet people that way
How else do you meet people outside school/job
Grožnjan
A small town in Istria, often overlooked by coastal cities like Rovinj or Pula
Small, cosy, beautiful and you can feel the history in the air
I'd say in Croatia every city and town that is not on te coastline and isn't Zagreb is underrated like Varaždin, Osijek, Sisak and Vinkovci being examples but Osijek mostly since it has a swamp nature reserve a few kilometers from there, the tallest concathedral after the Zagreb cathedral was shortened, beatiful river with a path along it,  a cool bridge, the best cuisine in Croatia(arguable but true) and generally a beatiful Austro-Hungarian city with an old town fort(Tvrđa) in the center near the river
Ah, Montepaschi
I live my whole life in Croatia and I have literally never heard of this place
Gotta check it out
I think most people missed the point of the question, it's not about false friends, but words that sound similar and have similar meanings, but have developed from different forms (in linguistics, this is called ["false cognates"] Shame, because it's a really interesting question
One such example is "mucho" in Spanish and "much" in English, which derive from two completely different PIE sources
No it isn't.  The name "Scott" would in Serbian be pronounced *skaat* (like the *ska* in the music band "Ska-P", with a short *t* at the end)
The Serbian word "skot" on the other hand is pronounced the way Scottish people say *scottish* without the -ish
So, quite different, actually
That's a mispronunciation then
You can't mispronounce a word and say "look, we say it like this". The correct way to pronounce the English given name Scott is [ˈskɑ:t], which is very different from a Serbian word skot, all I'm saying
Sorry but I don't see anything in your link to prove different from what I said
The problem with europe is that all the "good" countries to live in have shitty weather
I'd love to live in iceland or denmark or norway but i don't want to spend my winters in below freezing temperatures and dark
Even belgium and netherlands arent very famous for good weather
On the other hand, spain, italy, south of france, albania, montenegro, greece
not the most appealing countries to live in and many of them wouldnt feel like an upgrade from the present situation
If i had enough money that i dont need to worry about it for the rest of my life i'd probably move to mauritius or something like that
Summer all year long, baby
You can live there with basic english no problem at all
>Palm trees and beaches won't pay your bills or **fill the holes in your life**
They would sure help
Bills would get paid by the money i have saved since i said "if i didnt have to worry about the money". If i get sick of it i'd just fly back home during the summer
What do i get here
Woohoo, i can get to vienna in 4 hours
When was the last time i did that tho
The only places i drove to in the last year were serbia and bosnia and i wouldnt lose much if i skip it in favor of living on an island paradise
This winter doesnt count
But yeah, denmark seems like a place to be
I've never been there sadly but it feels like a perfect mix between scandinavian countries and the netherlands, the best from both
Why did you pick those two
Why not greece or france
Regarding italy, i grew up in Pula, the biggest city on the istrian peninsula which is right next to italy
During august we get hundreds of thousands of italians flocking here and, i'm really sorry italians, but it's hard for me to endure that 1 month
Imagine living with them your whole life
It wasnt my intention to bash the italians here, to each their own, but i just can't take it, they arent my type of people
Also, italians are highly religious which i want to escape from here in croatia
Then there's the politics, they voted for berlusconi for years and years
That tells me their politics are a joke, just like in croatia which, again, i wanna escape from
Then the crime which happens down south (which is the place i'd like to live in italy), constant murders and shit
I dont know what to tell you about spain, i've been there only once, maybe i'm wrong
Let me organize a dream vacation for you then, it's in my freezer
You'll have everything your heart desires
I dont know what to tell you about the south of france, maybe it'd be better than now
Since a lot of you questioned some countries i asked myself why did i put them on the list in the first place
I know why italy is there, it's mainly because i find italians too loud, i think there's a lot of corruption in the country and other things which i wrote elsewhere
But now when i think about it i see that i lumped spain and france together without any proper reasons so maybe i'm wrong
I still think that spanish and french are too loud tho and i guess i wanna escape that "southern mentality" as well
Doubt it man
One of the worst things in the world is when i have to get up before 7 to go to work and then i step outside, snow everywhere, still dark, and i have to clean my fucking car
Wiping that white shit up and down while i'm freezing to death and while the snow is getting in my shoes
Fuck that
Its not for everyone
Here's an example, my wife loves the snow and the cold
Can't tell you how many times we had a fight when i got out the shower, entered the room to get dressed and i see the wide open window with -10 outside
I'd kill her right then and there
Anyways, we can't shower together because the water i use burns her while i don't even feel it, she can't hold her hand under it while i can easily wash my face, balls, whatever
And the water she uses is ice cold to me while it's lukewarm for her
I'm also constantly cold, i'm walking around the house closing windows she opened while she's in her t-shirt
I guess it highly depends from person to person
Thanks, i wanna visit portugal as well, never been there but i heard only the best
This is one of the best things about croatia and one of the reasons i'm not moving anytime soon
We have sun and we have mountains just an hour away, we have 3 different climates, depending on what you prefer
Life is pretty good, except for the obvious problems like people, government and shit like that
well, if someone's favourite day is a random day without a wind then you gotta take the wind seriously
yeah, i fucking hate the wind as well
but, on the other hand, the plan is to visit island next spring, we gonna go camping around your little island
we heard the spring time is the best time
It's not crazy, croatia truly is one of the most amazing countries in the world, regarding geography
As i said, that's one of the main reasons i'm staying here and now, since we're in the EU more and more people are coming from abroad which i really like
Or maybe its all the oil in norway's case
In that case i wouldnt have to move then
Not these fuckers that keep commenting how they like the dark and cold winters
But good riddance, i say, it would be a country of normal people :D
>What did happen ? Were they too obnoxious ?
Well, some are but that's just normal, everyone has obnoxious tourists
Sorry man, i really don't want to bash italians, i'm just saying that you are a bit too loud for me
Everyone's shouting all the time
>I think the general perception about this theme is screwed, Italy (including the south) has a low [murder rate] (0,67 over 100
000 inhabitants) even lower than Croatia (1,10)
Hmmm, what would be the murder rate for just the south
I keep reeding about these vespa executions where innocent get killed as well but you know better than me, for sure
I've been to italy plenty of times, things dont change
But either way, i'm not bashing them, they are loud and thats a fact
Nothing wrong with it, it's just that i can't stand it
There are plenty of people who dont mind loud talking
We're limited with our vacation days during the summer and those that we get we spend on relaxing by the sea
Travelling is for the off season
Regarding the 24 hour day, no problem for me since i'm used to going to sleep after the sunrise
Not because i'm partying like crazy but because i used to spend too much time on my computer
last trip was to scotland so we can deal with cold and rainy
i'm really looking forward to it, i heard all the best
I was in the English CS:GO voice chat and I spoke Croatian language as I was talking with my brother and no one else and they were making fun of our language saying stuff like: "their language is stupid" or "I would kill myself if I spoke their language" me and my brother just stopped and said "we also speak English you idiots" at the same time
They immediately disconnected
Similar story happened to me, but much worse and a little less likely to happen considering there aren't many people from Croatia elsewhere (ok except Germany)
I was in Verona in a McDonalds waiting for the cashier to put the food on my tray and I noticed he didn't put a straw on it, so I, unaware that the straw dispenser is right next to me, arrogantly said in Croatian "For fuck's sake you could've at least given me a fucking straw" to which he replied "They're right here dumbass" in Croatian as well
We laughed it off in the end
Every time I travel somewhere I stumble upon Croatians in most random situations
Just last month I was visiting Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, waiting forever to use a bathroom, and whispered more for myself in frustration "o jebemte živote, oće li to više..." ("Oh fuck my life, what's taking so long", kind of) and guy in front of me turned around and replied "ne govori mi ništa, usrat ću se
" ("Tell me about it, Im gonna shit myself
We have that saying here too and you can hear it all the time
You are right, but still I mean a McDonalds worker in Verona
out of everybody I interacted with there, this was the only time I was a little aggressive and it turned out to be someone from the same city as me
Hahahaha takvi trenutci su najbolji
I mean that's true but there were 5 of us in a team and three of us were Croatian and it was quicker to talk to each other like that
Yes, absolutely
We use mostly Italian and German ones
Italian on the coast and German probably inland
So In Croatia most people play Tressette and Briscola (Italian cards) in the south and Belot in the north
Spanish not that much
Here in Croatia, on the coast, we play with italian cards, and they are very similar to spanish
Briškula and Trešeta are the games
In the continental part, people play with hungarian playing cards
Game is called Bela
I've seen these before in Croatia, but rarely
Us southern Croatians use the Italian deck 99% of the time to play Italian card games, such as the briscola (briškula) and tressette (trešete)
I haven't heard of it at all
The most used deck here is probably the German deck
Never heard of it in this form
They look similar to  what we would call italian cards, but they all have the same design different from this
Generally we have standard french deck, italian [triestine] decks are popular in the coast while so called [hungarian] is used in the inland
In Istria and north east Italy we call them Triestine, and are used to play briškula and trešete (both game names are from italian)
We adopted the Italian version with Italian names (Tristine version is the most popular here)
Its mostly popular on the coast while most people in the central Croatia never heard of it
and in coastal croatia
This German deck is used heavily in the northern and north-eastern parts of Croatia, in order to play "Bela".
I'm pretty sure on the coast we use Italian more for Briškule and Trešete
I wouldn't even give them the option of a test because they still might pass it
Just don't let them renew licences after they hit 65 or so and give them free public transit
Or give them one of those self driving cars
at 13 C I'll wear a thin jacket
at 8 C it's a regular jacket and a hat
5 C and under is a winter jacket, gloves, hat, extra leggings under jeans and boots
Anything colder than 20 is already too cold
But if I had to specify a temperature at which I become really agitated, it's around 10
Are you my long lost brother
I have a couple of friends from subtropical/tropical countries and my envy is immeasurable
There's no greater hassle than putting on half of your closet and leaving your apartment in the morning when it's rainy, cold and still dark
On the other hand, warm weather has never been a problem for me
I don't really think words, rather I see a map of europe
Well that escalated quickly
Life is boring and I used to be unemployed for 3 months even tho my mom and sad took care of me and I had video games and went to lakes with them it was boring
Life is more intresting when you have something to fuck you like a work but with money that I would win I would take brakes from work when ever I wanted
Not just post-soviet and post-warsaw pact, its a thing across most of Ex-Yugoslavia
Our "nation-forming" party, HDZ, was and still is full of ex-Communist Party of Yugoslavia members
Same goes for SDP - social democrats, but its all being replaced by younger people
Especially left/center smaller parties that got some seats in the parliament during these elections
I would say its about 30%. Its been declining, but i feel like quite a lot of young people of both sexes smoke nowadays while before it was mostly men
Well a bunch of my friends smoke(I don't) and a lot of people in general
Not just cigarettes but also weed here and there
Kids can go buy cigarettes in stores easily, noone will do anything about it
Society does not force people to smoke tho we just have easy access so a lot of people smoke
I went to buy cigarette paper once I was 14(for other purposes) and noone asked a thing
30%? I'd say most people smoke
"Croatia
Isn't that, like, in yugoslavia
No, Yugoslavia broke apart almost 30 years ago
We fought bloody for our independence and it's annoying how uneducated you are about the country you're visiting, especially if it's in the Balkans
Saying Tesla is *only* Serbian
Equalising Croatian and Serbian language
“You are a Balkan country” will trigger half and half not :)
Heard this about pretty much any Slavic country lol
You here to fill out your daily warcrime quota
Yeah like they are just dialects of it
You make a big fuss about nothing dude
In Croatia we call you "Češka". So, female form of the word
In English it just makes more sense to use the "female" form (even though English has no noun genders)
Hot take they are not
Southeastern Europe is just a new name for the Balkans, which kinda works the same as Eastern Europe in the way its perceived
We have more Serbs than I thought(189k)
And to add to that; a lot of Serbs never say that they are Serbs nowadays; so there's probably more (I mean hey, I'm one lol)
Yeah I knew we had Serbs near me there are a lot of Serbian villages but I never knew that we had 189000 Serbs like where are they
It is also a result feom way back when Bulgars concured Serbia in 10
Century and Croats let them settle in their lands near Knin for safety and some stayed forever
Last time I checked he was from Austria
Mostly around the border with Serbia and in larger cities, such as Zagreb
There some in the area of the former Vojna Krajina (Banija, Kordun,Lika etc
) too, but not nearly as much as before the war
I wrote a longer comment on a similair question on AskBalkans that explains why a bit more, but the short of it yes, and I've seen other Serbs being treated differently, I know a guy who gets mocked and people didn't want to hang out with him just because of it
Here it is if you wanna read it
While Serbs and Croats are extremely similair (I mean we have the same language) they are two different nations and people
Not in large numbers, no
Most Serbs came here during the Ottoman conquests and became border guards
Well, the vast majority of Serbs did come to Croatia in the 15th century and later
Da granica sa Srbijom i Baranja, zapadna Slavonija i Banija, Kordun i Lika, ali u Lici,Baniji i Kordunu živi jako malo ljudi
Najvjerojatnije je većina pomijesana u vecim gradovima
Exactly
The young people don't really care nor some of the elderly people example are concerts, Croatians love Serbian bands and vice versa so you can see Croats, Bosnians and Serbs enjoying music together on concerts
Serbs also go to Croatia for a vacation and Croats near the border go to Serbia to enjoy low prices and cheap shoes
But mostly people who fought in the war and had trauma and their kids have issues with going to Serbia and just the name Serbia
But Croats generally have issues with Serbs mostly because all of the dead and lost people during the war who ended up in Serbia and were never given back to their families, Serbia still denies that
Also the town of Vukovar which looked like a post-apocalyptic town  after the war and all the Serbs and Croats together sharing the same town
It is like the person who killed your parents and raped your sister was in front of you in the line in the grocery store and you have no right nor proof to do the same back
It is true what you are saying but some Serbs migrated to Croatia from the fear of the Bulgars too
But they were always there since the beginning of south slavic history and so were the Croats in Vojvodina
Hvala puno :)
S obzirom da mi stara to ne radi, ne
Ali hvala ti, i vjeruj mi, jesam ponosna :)
Well
yeah
Well if you know Cyrillic I recommend Cyrillic because more slavs use Cyrillic but Serbian Cyrillic has the same sounds as Croatian Latin so for serbo-croatian it is the same but in Serbia and Bosnia they use both while in Croatia only the Latin
Maybe, it is probably just personal opinion but Russian Cyrillic is different from the Serbian one
Croatia-pools 0
Its against the rules
Beaches 10% tops, but probably closer to 5%
Maybe 1-3%. Can be more or less depending on the beach
Was far more common 15-20+ years ago
I'd go for less than 5% as I can't remember when I last saw a woman sunbathe topless
Indeed stupidly false, I wish it was 50% though
Finally someone realistic
I'd say even less than that
No way it's 15% here
Less than 1 imo
Yup, it looks like I am underpaid as well
And I work a normal job, a good job
damn
Guess me and the boss need to have a talk
Haha
Edit: I live and work in Germany
Googling them and then liking all of their photos in a swim suit on instagram and facebook would truly be a real power move
Bonus points if its after midnight
Since no Croatians here, let me introduce Zagreb's ~~mayor~~ lifelong dictator [Milan Bandic]
Croatia
Croatia Speaking
Cmon bro, Ingrid Antičević Marinović: [
&#x200B;
PIPL MAST TRAST AS
Not sure if this was posted in the comments, but [this] made me feel ashamed of coming from a country that allowed her to represent us in the EU parliament
There are more examples, but this has to be the worst
Day after yesterday is also a clasic
"Because you can be do what we want to do"
Loving the new motto of the EU
Not Greek but I did hear him speaking Ancient Greek tho and a part of me died inside
Still can't believe people consider \*that\* a sign of intelligence/culture
Ingrid's speech may be the most famous, but our former minister of defence Damir Krstičević is also famous for his amazing English skills:
"people must trust us" speech deserves an honourable mention
People must trust us is invincible
Was looking for this
Ustasha regime in WW2
It wasn't a Belgian colony it was Leopold's personal property
Well it did become a Belgian colony later but Belgian government annexed it specifically to end Leopold's atrocities, Belgium didn't do shit
I honestly find it kinda pathetic how countries that were nutral in WW2 like Sweden and Switzerland now have this charade of *"oh we're so terrible for staying out of the war and not actively fighting Nazis"*
As if you ever stood a chance, all you would've achieved is direct Nazi occupation and even more direct enforcement of their rule
You choose the least bad option
There are at least 2
I know a number of Nazi officials did criticise Ustashe for their brutality consequently doing opposite of what they were intended to (pacify the region)
And yes, they were brutal to say the least
Now I wonder what they originally wrote
That had to do more with the wish to destabilise the Ustashe state (split between German and Italian occupation zones), exert more influence and to gain help in fighting Tito's resistance
Those rebels, Chetniks, exercised similiarly brutal reprisals on Croatian population (even though in that area Croats were mostly anti-Axis) so Italian support for them didn't exactly come from the goodness of their hearts
They were Emu collaborators
No mercy for them
Definitely the Ustasha regime in World War II
Jasenovac camps in ww2, under the Ustaša regime
Being in Personal union with Hungary
I'd agree with you if you could prove they established legitimate country with popular support, not a mere puppet state
>Something awful along the same lines **would have happened** in 20th century Europe
Historical determinism is BS
Nothing in history was inevitable
Was there a high chance of a highly nationalist government rising in Germany
Yeah
Was it inevitable that they'd commit the biggest genocide in human history
In some Croatian places, after a funeral there is a big meal for the friends and family (sort of like a wake but post-funeral I guess)
On the head of the main table there is a place reserved for the deceised, with a plate and a glass turned upside down to signify they are no longer there
Turnes out, the Phoenecians used to do exactly the same thing, so it is a 3000-4000 yr old tradition
I don't personaly practice this but lots of people still practice the ancient balkan tradition of hating all of our neighboring countries
Yes, there's this guy who was born like 2000 years ago
Nobody knows when actually but we're all celebrating his imaginary birthday which was a pagan celebration to begin with
And if you think this is crazy wait till you hear how we celebrate his death and that special time when he left a cave 3 days later
Yeah, shit's crazy with your slava
So let me get this straight because i never understood it properly:
The oldest son takes over his father's slava when he dies, but until then he doesn't have one even if he has his own family
What happens to younger sons
Do they choose their own saint and date
What if you're a younger son who married an only daughter, do you take your father in law's slava since nobody's there to inherit his
I feel like this is a game of ping pong with saints
You get a saint, you get a saint, everybody gets a saint
No way
REALLY
Oh, you haven't heard of whats-his-name, our lord and savior
Lol, look, a polish person complaining about the lack of vowels
Jokes aside, in croatian (we also say smrt) r can transform into a vowel when needed, just like the letter y in the english alphabet
Wasn't us southerners for sure, it's smrt here as well :D
Ok, al to znaci da braca nece skupa slavit slavu kad su svi u svojim kucama, svak slavi svoju, ili
Da, da, kuzim taj dio
Ali evo, imas tri sina, sva 3 se isele i ozene, sva 3 preuzmu slavu na sebe i niti jedan od te 3 ne dodje tebi, njihovom tati, na slavu jer sva trojica organiziraju slavu doma
Kuzis
A Croatian guy who doesn't smoke, is not going out to cafe with his friends and doesn't care about football at all
A Croatian that doesn't complain
A Croatian who doesn't like football
Or says burek wit cheese
What does it mean
same with balkans
Same thing with me, I'm from croatia
I don't.
I would say so
I would say slightly less prevelant
Yes, I am 16
No, not at all
Few months ago I saw a girl from my high school which took money from the ATM and I was shocked and confused
But I payed a couple of times with my dad's debit card
I dont have a job, I am in school
No, nobody has time for a part time job, but some have a job for a two months in summer
Around 6 hours in school + travel time which is proximity 1+ hours each day (depending on where you live and what kind of school do you want to go)+ learning, a lot of learning, especially if you go to the gymnasium
I had a friend who travelled around 2 hours just in one direction to school
He transfered to closer high school because he didnt have time to learn
Yes
Do you even sleep then
Because my friends dont even have time for home work sometimes
croatian
sunce (the sun) is neuter, but iirc the modern word is a diminutive of the originally feminine one
mjesec (moon and month) is male, though
I'd say the golden age is the present for Romania
>Most people worked 7 to 5,
What great working conditions
I was being sarcastic
That's 10 hours
That's insane
Who works more than 8 hours a day regularly
Koji kurac
Odvratno
wait, none of you could swim and you went on a dinghy in the deep
man, sorry, but you really fit the polish/czech stereotype people in croatia have :D
Are you thinking of a hedgehog
Because there are no porcupines in Croatia
oh shit, is it the Vandersexxx
yeah, we have scorpions everywhere down here
you get used to them but i still kill them when i see them
sorry scorpions :(
I dont think you can get stoned by eating fresh marihuana leaves so maybe the sheep were just being dicks
Continental Croatia as a whole
Most cities are hundreds of years old and have old cores, with enough investment each could be mini Prague or mini Budapest
But all money is invested in coast and capital
It's sad really
Well pretty much all of eastern Croatia(Slavonia) has amaizing food, culture and overall awesome people who apsolutely appreciate tourists because they don't come much
I reccomend the Baranya region to check out, mountains in Slavonia(there is a UNESCO Geopark there) and cities like Osijek, Požega, Đakovo, Vinkovci and Vukovar especially for those war stories there
Osijek and basically whole Slavonija region
Honestly, the tourists are missing out
German i would say at least here because a lot of people go work in Germany . But other than that maybe Russian for eastern Europe
Serbian becouse the whole world is Serbia
But if you're looking for a serious answer probably French or German or Spanish
Where are these types of Germans, because working in IT for an American company that has subsidiaries all over the world the only other language used in company wide emails and documents is German
You think Poland will take over Germany in importance
Poland has neutral growth so no, that isn't going to happen
Not to mention that Poland's economy isn't growing at some astronomical rate that would make them the biggest economy in 30 years
They're doing
Fine
it would be haram to deprive yourself of rakija
Wow, didnt know that, very cool
Ive never met a Kartvelian before
How is your country doing
Ohh man, A je to and Krtek was the shit
Pretentious nerds: (eagerly awaiting to blurt out Fenno-Scandia)
You would not be a good parent if you didnt let your children watch the hood classics
I feel you, Im also a nerd
But Ive realised its very annoying if I do that around non geography nerds so
Tito or Pavelić
Depends on where you stand
Charles II on the other hand
I hate equally Pavelic and [Borna, Duke of Dalamtia
That fucker sided with Franks against Ljudevit, Duke of Pannonian Croatia, and I’m still salty about it
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Cut him some slack, the guy lived in the time which we don't even understand
We don't even know how both sides saw each other
Some do
Extreme leftists and those who directly benefited from his reign do
The rest don't.
I'm not here for your self righteous lectures,you know nothing about my nations history which makes anything you say invalid
You are saying that as if he was not the greatest Spanish monarch
That’s a very reasonable point to make, but I’m just a human
And historian
We’re the worst
We hold grudges for centuries, nah millennium
Fucker
I know a number of people of moderate opinions who like Tito
Not to the point of adoring him, but thinking his positives overule his negatives
He is directly responsible for deaths of hundreds of thousands of POW and civilians
He would have been held responsible for war crimes under a fair trial
Now you know this guy is not sane
Any sane Croat hates Pavelic
And we are big majority
Trust me
But, on other hand, it does not mean we like Tito
We don’t hate him particularly, I mean there’s many, many others in our history we could hate more, but in the end he was a dictator and we are not crazy about Yugoslavia now because of recent history
Older people like him more, younger don’t.
I hate Tudjman too
I think he was an asshole and that we would fared much better with someone else as president, me preferring Gotovac, but that’s what would be if
Well, yes whatever the number was
I don't know why you are telling me this, I am just talking about my experience
Depending which dialect you can probably learn Croatian proper but then you might come to the northwest Croatian mountains(Hrvatsko Zagorje) and hear a total different language that even Croats can't understand or you might go to Slavonia or Dalmatia and hear an absolutely different accent and new words which aren't used in Croatian proper so every part of Croatia is different especially the northwest, North(međimurje), northeast, Istria and of course eastern Lika, Kordun and eastern Slavonia where they speak Serbian
And if you learn Croatian proper usually we can hear a non-native speaker and also most people actually learn Serbian rather than Croatian because it is a little bit easier
Our language is very regionally fragmented
Not just into the 3 really differing dialects but also on a city to city level
What you might hear and say in Zagreb may not be understood in Pula
Pretty hard, I would say almost impossible for non-Slavs
Especially considering the many regional dialects
Grammar-Its medium
Pronounciation-Very hard
Unless you're from an another ex-Yugo country lol
I live in Germany and I'm having sooo much problems with German as I just moved in last year
I'm level B2-ish as I studied it in school for 9 years, but it feels like I need an MSc to understand someone from Schwaben
I'm pretty jealous of all the Dutch guys who speak better than me, yet only learned German for half the time I have
On the other hand, Croatian is definitely harder to learn for any foreigner than German
There's just too much shit
and even if you do learn it pretty good, chances are you won't understand what I'm even saying
I would say less dialects but als9 because it is a little easier to pronounce like in Croatian you wpuld say rijeka(river) and in Serbian reka also meaning river it is all about the ije and je in words like in Croatian snijeg(snow) in Serbian sneg also meaning snow
More less, the biggest difference is the ije and je thing which happened when the languages were forming and before ije, je and e we just had ѐ which was a sound with all the ije, je and e. And the difference is also with saying the future in Croatian we would say "Moramo ići" (we have to go-verb in infinitive) and in Serbian it would be" moramo da idemo"(we have to go-verb in present with the word "da")
These differences don't make a difference in understanding each other we can understand each other like brother and sister but these are just some bigger diffrences
Hahaha what a coincidence didn't know Russians and Ukranians have a similar thing
I dont really care since i work in stem research so we dont follow 7 day schedule anyway
4 day work week would likely have no impact
Experiments cant be put into timetables, especially for PhD and postdocs who work unpaid overtimes and weekends anyway
Also I feel companies would (justifiably
) Cut salaries by 20% in that case, and that leaves people at worse position tgan now
But if you are an owner of a company, and your workers now work one day less, it means your production dropped by more or less 20%. Do you really expect hourly wages to rise in order to keep monthly total the same with less work days
Would this switch to 4 day work week imply that companies hire more workers, all of which work four days (in overlaping shifts) to keep their 5 day/week levels production or is the "new" day considered weekend and company shouldnt operate if its not necessary
Thanks to Belgium for the saxophone, I play it and I love it
I would like to thank Slovenia for being so small so we can pass it through in only 40 minutes when we go back to Croatia from abroad on vacation
I am trolling
I love our little bro, Slovenia
Thanks Poland for saving Croatia from the Ottomans, if u never saved us Croatia wouldnt exist today
Thanks, we love you too
Funny thing is that Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are only 2 countries I support during European Championships, and Faroe Islands and 2 irelands in qualifications because only you can bring that romantic feeling of sportmanship not only only on the pitch but also on your end of the stadium
I was drinking beer and watching your game against the Spain in 2012
with my friends and we commented that in spite of 3-0 loss your players played like it's 30th min and 1-0 for spain
Not to mention your win over Italy in 2016
good one
You forgot the devil's triangle of europe - croatia, serbia, b&h, montenegro
We understand each other (almost) perfectly
thats my take on polish as well as a croatian
Write it down, reduce all the z, w etc
and think about archaic words and you can get the meaning
Also macedonian and bulgarian are also quite understandable for us
Slovene a little bit less but people from northern regions understand them much better
Also I can understand almost half of eastern slavic languages (russian, ukrainian) while west slavic less
... you forgot the south Slavs
I think we understand eachother the best
Kosovo speaks Albanian so
that one is the black sheep of the family
I must say, as a Croat, it's easier to understand Slovaks than Czechs
And can't say those two languages sound the same
Same
I am Croat amd can also understand more Slovak than Czech
I don't know exactly why, but it sounds clearer I guess
Now daily almost becuse of buying new planes but usually not so much
Football > Life
Identity
Yes, it exists
We all have multiple identities
I'm a citizen of my country, of EU, of Europe, of my region, of my city, and even the city district I grew up in left some part in my overall identity
And this is just geographic
We also have other identities - our family, linguistical, religious, professional, our hobbies and interests etc
Being defined by solely one thing would strike me as overly simple, and for me being European is a part of who I am
EU overall is already an economical superpower
And we're already semi-federal in many ways
EU as a state, perhaps and I hope so - we'll be stronger together
As a nation, no, not really
However, a state doesn't need to be a "nation state" necessarily
I wouldn't call us overrated, but still
It's just a coastline with cheap local prices
I don't get how we got 21 million visits last year
From my point of view, in Croatia it is Plitvice lakes
When I went to Vienna I met up with a friend there that took me to all the non-touristy places around the city and I had a great time but in the end I still had a craving for doing something cliche and touristy so I went to Cafe Sacher
I must say that it's probably overrated, but I had a great time there acting like I was a part of the Austrian Aristocracy in the 19th century
Overpeiced and overcrowded for sure but it was city state that lasted for 500 years during ottoman invasion and still have preserved walls so not overrated
You about to anger some Croatians, including me lmao
It is very overpriced I agree but Dubrovnik definetly has something to stand out for
The other reply said it all, a city state which lasted 500 years and only brought down because of the Habsburgs who used the opportunity to take it after the Napoleonic wars
But there are d3finetly better places too like all the islands thet exist, Lika and Gorski Kotar mountains, Zadar is very nice and Šibemik too
Also the coastline isn't the only part of Croatia if you want better food and wine Slavonia is the way to go
Its true, Italians and Brits, but the main difference is that Italian teens can handle alcohol better so the Brits are the worst guests there
From Croatian pow Split is considered full of trash and junkies, rude and uncivilised people, so its not rated at all :)
Well, for foreign tourists it is
Sure, every local tourist was in split once i guess but local tourist prefer smaller and quiet places
>is Balkan
Uhhhhhhh
serbia, kinda complicated but we're working things out :)
Whoever touches our border
or shares the waters with us
or borders the country that borders us
Serbia definitely, we had a war with them in 1991 when we tried to become independent from Yugoslavia
It is always been Serbia and Hungary
Serbia and Croatia alwqys had disputes about Bosnia a stuff
Hungary wanted to control our lands from 1102
We went to war with them during 1848 revolution
And after WW1 it had just been Serbia,in Yugoslavia Serbs were dominant and it always bothered us Croats which resulted in Homeland war in the 90s.
Our relations are getting better but when we play against each other it is like playing a final
its a rivalry triangle
More is not required friend
can confirm
[Us]
Ya, and there are few other sayings/names for them as well,  but it's all in light-hearted spirit
not a polygon but a clusterfuck
business
Dominium maris baltici when
Samobor here, 15km away from Zagreb
It woke me up
It felt like someone was shuffling my bed in the room
No damage or wounded here
It felt like someone is shaking my bed really hard
My TV an PS4 fell from the shelf and are wrecked :( My gf jumped out of bed in 1 second
I froze
Biggest shock you can feel I think
I live on the 6th floor
This was the first big earthquake I felt in my life
I almost shit myself
People rushed out of the building
We stayed in the cars for a while
I went to check on my grandpa but he was fine
Anyways, that was NOT a good way to start the day
I reside close to the center of Zagreb in an old building waiting to be destroyed by an earthquake, so I felt it pretty strongly (once I woke up of course)
Not a good feeling to be woken up on a Sunday at 6:20am by glass shatering and facades falling apart
Also now I have at least 1 crack in every room and it's ugly as shit
One 15 year old girl unfortunately died today, very sad :(
i live in zagreb and it woke me up when it started, there is light to medium damage to older buildings, report of kid that died turned out to be false, some churches were damaged so its good thing everyone is isolating, it was not as bad as it could have been
Some buildings were damaged in the town center, top of the church was destroyed and I heard a 15 year old boy died
And didn’t feel it maybe I am strong sleeper I only woke up because my sister screamed
It was very bad
The most scariest thing I felt in my life
I was sure that I'm going to die
Everything is fine at this moment, but my mental state is not
The worst part is that we don't feel safe at home anymore, but we can't go out because of the corona
Many people left Zagreb since this morning so there is a possibility for spreading corona even more
Guess im living under a rock, i live in brela, didn't feel a thing
My uncle lives in a top floor flat in a pretty old building near the center of Zagreb
I called him and he said that he and his dog are fine, but his living room is full of debris, as the roof above it collapsed
My fatrher woke me up shouting that we all have to leave our house
I continued sleeping, we aren't even near the place where earthquake took place, Hungary is closer to the eartquake than I am
I just now saw the videos and reports and it looks kinda bad
My aunt lives in Zagreb and she had to flee the building
I live on the 16th floor
The building was leaning like crazy
Thankfully it was built to counter earthquakes so there is no damage done to it
I just remember waking up to everything shaking pretty badly and thinking it was that damn draft again
i live about 1 to 2 hours away from zagreb, people say shit went wild but i slept through the whole thing :c
Its gonna be snowing in a few days too
I am in Dalmatia and I slept like a baby
Thats odd since we in Dalmatia havent felt anything
>15 year old boy died
She* is still fighting for her life
But she is the only victim as long as I can tell
Earthquakes, virus, red water, meteors
What's next, frogs
Locusts
The Angel of Death taking firstborns
Fucking biblical, mate
The fourth being hladan beton
Yeah we know the epicenter was in Zagreb
It might be
But its more likely because Austrian border and Slovenian towns are closer to Zagreb then Split is to Zagreb
I agree with the party places, don't see the appeal at all
Same with beachy, sunny, hot places like Maldives, Fiji, Hawaii etc
Vast majority of USA seems rather boring
Again hot places like Dubai, India and such
I see zero appeal in deserts and heat, generally, I don't get the popularity
I prefer older, historical places, small towns, I'm really glad I live in Europe, so most interesting places are close
Buildings, architecture, etc
I don’t see the appeal to them
I love beaches, nature
Slovenian "Zahod" (meaning west) means toilet in Croatian
As in Croatian
Sure, with a decent wage life is pretty damn good here
I am definitely moving after college
I don't like it here because of a mentality
I'm not saying all people have this "balkan mentality" but there is a lot of people like that
Also, politicians are corrupt, we can't change anything because of the parliamentarian type of government without a straight up massive riot
There's 2 corrupt big parties and everyone votes for them and I'm sick and tired it
You can always come to Croatia which is basically a Czech exclave during summer :)
hearing Germans about visiting Poland and France is always mixed bag :D
I visited Corse 2 years ago in november and it was super empty, only locals chilling in cafes
Bonifacio is indeed very beautiful
hahaha or that commercial for a car "from Berlin to Warsaw on one tank"
Not me but my mom fled from Bosina durning war and she never went back
There was this thing in the balkans during the 90s and shit got rough in sarajevo so my dad packed us up and gtfo
Haven't regretted it one bit
Don't know any for taking a shit but for taking a pee we say *Idem kokotu pustiti krv* - I'll go spill the rooster's blood
It was wildly popular across exYU too
Newer models could be occasionally spotted, but not nearly as often
Used to be common here in 80s/90s, started dissapearing afterwards, except the Niva, I still see those and I don't even live in a rural area
The new Lada models are looking good though, if they sold those new Niva Urbans here I would be interested
In Zagreb its a 50/50ifhe will let you pass orjust go his way
Pssst, hey
You want some catholic approved rakija
Just your classic Baba Roga (Grandma with horns ^sounds ^way ^better ^than ^horny ^grandma )
She eats children and lives in the woods
>Putin still does karate, plays hockey
I see you're still exposed to quality free media there in Serbia
It's always good to know what's Putin up to in his free time
>stop making it be a media thing
As if you would take an interest if you weren't exposed to that bs
Actually I've seen it myself
I live in croatia, one of the smallest european countries and 30 minute up to 1 hour drive to work is pretty normal
It takes me 20 minutes but then again i drive in the opposite direction of the biggest traffic jams
People going to the city centre will spend a lot more time for shorter distanced than my route
That being said, what we usually dont do is drive extra long distances to work, we usually prefer just to move closer
Lets say the normal limit is 50ish km, everything above that is rare
I don't exactly 'fit in' and in some regards I'm unusual for my country, also I couldn't care less about Croatian subreddit, sometimes I check it out when I wanna feel annoyed and disappointed lol
I feel stereotypical in some ways and the opposite in others and the same would be the case in pretty much any other country
But I 100% feel like I belong in this part of the world, especially coastal part of the country
I always felt Slavic+Mediterranean in my soul, for example I can't imagine myself being a Dutch girl
It depends, regionally, where I live (Dalmatia, Croatia) people (men) drink wine after lunch
be it one glass or one liter, then they have a nap for hour or two and then drink some more,  Some older people drink hard liquor (rakija) before breakfast because it is good for metabolism
Theres also quite distinction between alcoholics and before mentioned healthy life style
but lines can be blurred depending
of maybe weather
lol
I dont think that theres big difference between young people indulging in alcohol anywhere
But after three in the morning you can see, stuff
and its not just alcohol, everything goes
Sex drugs and whatever mindfuck music is playing in the club
But no matter what younguns are expected to be present on  family lunch
Also older men drink more wine, maybe beer and women hard liquor, (in secret)
in every house that you come like guest no matter time you'll be offered alcohol and food
Here alcohol is lifestyle
Also its not unusual to see people early day drinking beer (it counts as breakfast) while working some hard job
Especially in hot weather
What I see difference in young people that we(?!) don't do shots, it is mostly relaxed, wine and beer, but after three anything goes
Pretty much as you said
Only "acceptable" among highschool/early college  activity
You can do it later but only like once a year
Going out drinking when adult should end with you still being mostly coherent
I must share my grand grandmother  daily routine, and she lived hundred years
And was matriarch
Wake up, shot of Moonshine, than raw egg
Breakfast, old bread and milk, and maybe wine
(yes old people here mix wine with milk; when I was like three I liked it very much)
Than is time for, lunch, something light, mostly fish
than glass or two wine mixed with water
Than siesta
Light supper followed with glass or two of wine mixed with water
When she felt under the weather there was only one medicine, You guessed it, moonshine (rakija)
She died of old age, 100 year old
her last supper we brought her goat cheese and wine with water, she said Give me whole wine
Legend
you typed h insted of j my guy
Considering how active those people are, I'm surprised we don't have any big ones here
Every year before Christmas, there's a group of these anti abortion morons 24/7, praying and holding billboards along one of the entrances to a hospital near where I live
Yes, and the holy spirit will be watching
Macedonian is like 90% intelligible for me
Slovenian is closer to 70%. I have a really hard time with spoken Bulgarian but written is pretty inteligible
I also find West Slavic languages ewsier to understand than East Slavic languages, Czech and Slovak more than Polish
Well we slavs understand each other very much but which one is easier to read than listen to
So all the south slavic languages except for Slovenian are easy to listen to and easy to read
Slovenian I think is much more easier to read but depends where are you from
Northern Croats have a very Slovenian style dialect
West slavic languages are definetly easier to read than to listen maybe as an exception for northern Croats
East slavic languages are I think easier for us to understand tho at least for me
Ukranian is pretty easy along with Russian and Belarusian I would rather read
I feel like italian would fit for many people on the coast
I can read italian quite fine and understand spoken (at least when not spoken too fast)
But i just dont have the vocabulary to say more than a few phrases
>(I should add that even some Danish people can’t tell written Danish and Norwegian apart, instead thinking it is just Danish with some grammar mistakes or typos
LOL That's the case with Serbian and Croatian
I get "corrected" for the writing on serbian sites all the time in order for them to find out later that it was just Croatian all along and we have a bit of a different grammar
Being poor and complaining rather than trying to change anything
I guess drinking for all of the Balkans but for Croatia it is name days whom are already mentioned and maybe our style of eating, we usually eat bread with everything and always have soups before the main meals
Also our cuisine is special as in all of Balkans but I think sarma and peka style cooking will always stay
Oh my god Switzerland sounds like a paradise
Same experience here
I live in Germany and the local Bäckerei Haferkamp which seems to have a monopoly there is shit and super expensive
Yes, there are some local bakeries although very few - for instance on my way to work I have 1 local bakery and 4-5 Haferkamp's. I  haven't had too much time to explore as I've only been living there for a year or so, but from what I tried the local ones are quite good, but they are just not as easily accessible if you don't live close to one
Zagreb has a similar fate to Bremen
There are multiple big bakery companies that are thankfully very cheap, but unfortunately their bread is equally shit
I don't want to sound picky as I'm usually not, but if there's anything that I didn't like back home then it was the bread
Fortunately in the last couple of years we've had a couple of really good small bakery businesses open up close to the center of Zagreb, so now that I'm home I can finally enjoy some good family backed bread
I guess people here mostly eat normal white bread as it's the cheapest and most versatile, but you can also find ciabatta, baguettes (or any corn flour bread), focaccias (more seldom though) and no yeast bread - usually we would buy it at the Dolac farmers' market on saturday morning for the weekend
ćevapčići. everybody knows that
also, čvarci, pancerota, prikle, off the top of my head
We stole from Bosnia so Čevapi is very much enjoyed here
He's obviously talking about currywurst
I wouldn't say odd, but not a lot of people have it
You won't see flags hanging outside people's homes, and if you do, it's likely a holiday or a football match
Wearinh a hat or a tshirt, or anything else, with the flag is seen as not so sofisticated
Yes
I have lived in Denmark and their flag is everywhere
Supermarkets, schools, streets, people's backyards, on the buildings, windows
etc
I personally loved it
Denmark is a cool country and seeing one more country in Europe, except my own, to be so proud of their flag and nation was quite amazing to me
I am glad I lived in such a country
Wow, that's interesting
I'm in Zagreb, and we don't have them so many here
If somebody has them aside of holidays or football, I'd guess they are conservative or a war veteran
Then again, given Dalmacija is a tourist destination, maybe they're showing off their pride
:D I'd love to hear opinions of Dalmacija natives here
It is only controversial with Serbs
The "checker board" has been Croatian coat of arms since the beginings
There is a theory that when our coat of arms starts with first white field (current one is first red) that is a fascist one cause that is the one used in 1941-1945 by a fascist puppet state of NDH
But, that leaves the question of why did the previous coat of arms start with first white field then
Were our Medieval ancestors  nazis
I am very proud of our country today and to me personally first white or first red does not matter
They are both correct in historical matter
They are both croatian coat of arms and I do not associate either one of them with fascists
Just type in Google "old croatian coat of arms" and you'll see that most if not all of our coat of arms were first white field
Also on the roof of the church of St
Mark in front of our parliment building the coat of arms starts with white field
The coat of arms on our parliment building has first white field
The one from the 1600s has first white, all of the medieval ones have first white
and so on and so on
You tell me now
is there anything controversial about that
Edit: spelling
I think you forget the World Cup
[This photo] went around the world after Croatia beat England and qualified for the World Cup final, a huge sports achievement for a small country like Croatia
The picture is showing Vrsaljko taking a rest on our flag with a serene smile after third extra time in three games
I thought you would pick Willem's portrait  or smt

Nepotism in job industry and overall
You MUST know someone to get a shot at getting a job, going to a doctor any time soon, do any sort of paperwork
The fact that corruption is not only a regular occurence, it is often justified and in some extreme cases, glorified
Cynical would definitely be the right word for it
I also loathe the kind of people, most commonly found in Dalmatia unfortunately, who have this know-it-all attitude
They think they're the smartest, they talk the most and interrupt others, but in reality they're pretty dumb
Of course not many people behave as such, but only one is enough to ruin your day
I... I... I get unlimited data for that price
Oh yeah, that's fucking annoying
I usually tell that type of people "Let's switch jobs for a couple of weeks/months then, see how that works out
I could really use some exercise
I will never understand the mentality of people like that
I disagree with you
Cynical people are mostly more intelligent than non-cynical ones
> I also loathe the kind of people, most commonly found in Dalmatia unfortunately, who have this know-it-all attitude
They think they're the smartest, they talk the most and interrupt others, but in reality they're pretty dumb
Oh God
And then when you disagree with them or tell them why it's wrong they take it as an personal insult
Can you explain what is that
Ireland re-invents word "poor quality" when it comes to Europe
When someone like that gives you an advice which you didn't ask for and then when they found out you did it your way they act like you betrayed them
Familiar
Thank you for explaining it to me
How high is the public support for this
>  It may even illegal by international law, which in contrast to military type services clearly forbid mandatory citizen work
Even if it is, I don't think anyone would abide by it
European history is around 2000 years of "Hey that province is mine"
I think that you are confusing serbian politicians with serbian people
They have strong political strings with Russia but at least from my experience with my neighbours, people dont really care
Especially the young ones
I assume your media, like most medias, are very biased and you think that everyone who is friends with Russia is your enemy
Dont get me wrong, I feel more connected to Ukraine then Russia and I am really sorry for the things that are happening in your country, but Serbian people in general are not like you portreyed them to be
"lakat" (elbow) is used specifically in my home town and is 51
2 cm long
in the middle of the old town walls there's a statue depicting the medieval knight Orlando with the lakat engeaved at his feet
also while not outdated by sny means, you could say the base measurements in croatian are deciliters (dec) and dekagrams (deka) bc of how much more often they're used in spite of the base units
When buying stuff at the butcher or cold cuts/cheese we usually say the weight in "deka" as well
Jutro means "morning" in Serbian and Croatian
They're 100% related, coming from the same word in Proto-Slavic [*ùtro]
Pantheon, Rome
Alhambra
Gothic cathedrals (not easy to just choose one), prob Chartres
St Peter's basilica and square, Rome
Eiffel tower, Paris
Plitvice lakes, Croatia
Dolomiti, Italy
Fjords (again, which to choose)
and OFC
Lake Bled, Slovenia
It's just a little joke
If I had to choose something from Slovenia though, it would definitely be Škocjan caves
A whole canyon inside a cave is not something you see often
All of them it is
When I was a teen I couldn't stand most of my country's more folky music scene
I don't mean stuff like turbofolk (I still can't stand that), but stuff like dalmatian singers that sang about the sea, pop dancing music and the stuff you'd usually hear at weddings or big parties
Today I can't properly work or study without a dalmatian klapa or a Croatian pop playlist blasting my ears with pure bliss
I don't know if it's generally pleasing melodies, meaningful and catchy lyrics, or just hearing a beautiful harmony of a klapa, but I did a complete 180 on that subject
Totally the same
I used to hate our music and especially dalmatian klapa, but now it reminds me so much of summer and being home
It always puts me in a good mood when I listen to it
I would love if the bulgatian restaurant chain "Happy" came to Croatia
The food is fantastic (as well as everything I tried in Bulgaria), and you get the food very fast
Think McDonalds speed but homecooked quality dishes
The greek goody's. It is a very nice fast food restaurant with burgers
I used to like KFC as a kid, but nowdays they suck
Boy oh boy here we go:
Roman empire ( including later Byzantium ), we even had a few emperors from Croatia
Later we got into a personal union and got fucked by Hungary, mostly later on though
Then we got into an even bigger country and continued to get fucked by the Austrians
Then we got fucked in the 1st Yugoslavia, like a huge amount of state funds just went to Serbia and the eastern parts
Then uhm, the 90-ies were interesting to say the least, so Serbia as no
5 probably
Note: I don't hold any grudges against nations from this list that still exist, I believe Croatia has like pretty good relations with most of our neighbours
We learn more about the Habsburg Monarchy than we do about Hungary, but we definitely learn more about Hungary then we do about Austria
Thing is, Austria gets used as a synonym for the various forms the Habsburg imperial constructs took over time, so that's why people think of "Austria" when they think of "number of times thing is mentioned in history class". But realistically, we learn very little about Austria proper, instead focusing on the Habsburgs themselves, and the deep effect that being part of their holdings had on us
It depends on the professor tho
I remember that mine was crazily obsessed with Arpad Dynasty (We call them Arpadović lol), so much so that she would ask us in exams In which Croatian monastery did King Bella IV hid his royal treasures
I still don't know the answer to that question
I feel like that's not really true
We learn a whole lot about Hungary in the Habsburg monarchy
Ban Josip Jelačić, 1848
revolution, Croatian-Hungarian settlement of 1868
and Riječka krpica ("fiume blanket"), relations of Mađaroni (pro-Hungarian unionists) and Narodnjaci/Ilirci, later on the "new course" movement of 1903
/1905
, where the Croato-Serbian coalition allied with Hungarians against Habsburgs
Austria is mostly there through the relations of Croatian politicians with the Habsburg dynasty, and their constant blocking of unification of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia
I remember, when I was in school, I didn't really enjoy history (that changed later), and as a Dalmatian I kind of found it boring that I had to learn so much about relations with Hungary and Hungarians, when they were so far away and abstract for me :)
French influence in Balkans goes deep
In Croatia we have a saying that France did more for Croatia in its 5 years of rule than Austria did in its 500 years of rule
All of nationalism that happened in early and mid 19th century, all across Balkans was due to France
It helped Serbia to gain more independence from ottomans and Croatia to get more independence from Hungary and Austria
Also we are thought in school that Napoleon said "give me 100000 croats and I'll conquer the world" but as far as I know the evidence for that is flimsy and sources are questionable
Furthermore [Jean-michel Nicolier] is probably the most famous modern day Frenchman in here
Some of our most famous generals during Yugoslav wars trained at French foreign legion so there is that
I wouldn't go to much in the details about the Yugoslav wars since the wounds are still pretty fresh and any discussion on that will turn into a shitshow of nationalism which is something I wouldn't want
I just wanted to to point out how France is integral in Croatian nation building and nothing more
If you didn't beat us in Football in '98 and 2018 we would probably be really hard Francophiles
Also our handball teams faced each other so many times at the highest stages that we developed a sporting rivalry with you
There are many many more instances of French influence going back to freaking Charlemagne but my post is getting pretty long so I got to draw a line somewhere
Well my zero evidence theory is that he really liked his hussar battalions
Poland and Balkans had the longest tradition of hussars in Europe so I can see Napoleon saying something like give me 100000 hussars and I will conquer the world, which in the near future became a quote that ran throughout eastern Europe during Spring of Nations as a way to build up national pride
I mean Magyar hussars are kind of a no brainer, but I was trying to connect the dots on that Napoleon quote
I believe due to housing shortages in cities all over the continent there will be a trend of migration back to rural ares, which will (let's hope) also provoke a need for better railway infrastructure and connections
Honestly, it may be peaceful now, but I have a bad feeling Europe will go for round 3 of "World War".
Resources on Earth are getting exhausted every day, and it's only a matter of time before some conflicts start, we can only hope we will find alternative solutions
It's 2 extremes
Either "mega prosperity federal EU land" or "Oh shit the EU collapsed and now everything is going to shit and oh god there is russia and there is hunagry oh fuck were all gonna die"
Exactly, my city was hit by earthquake in second week of lockdown, which frightened a lot of people so many (who have weekend houses or family willing to accomodate them) simply moved for a few months, and it made amazing difference for the city (especially in regards to traffic)
Neki tvrde da se to ne može, ja vam tvrdim da se to može!
Moomins and spurdo are ebin :DDDDD
EDIT: Fixed the end
It might seem stupid, slavic countries all around
Buy I bet most people would choose Austria
Yes, they ruled over us, but they were good to us
And they remembered when Yugoslavia was falling apart
As much as some nationalists would hate to admit it, it's either Bosnia or Serbia
Same language, pretty much the same culture (there are differences, but they're more on a regional level, rather than on a national one), a lot of shared history
Now, it's true the politicians like to stir up shit, and the 90s were a bad period, but the connections between our countries remain strong and if a Bosnian, Croat and Serb met somewhere in Western Europe, it's much more likely they would befriend each other than people of other nationalities, and help out each other
Yes same here
Well we in Croatia always great Ukranians with specialty since you come and work here and we immigrated from west Ukraine /south Poland and the White Croats(ones who didn't migrate and stayed) are now assimilated in Ukranian culture
Supposedly we also have the same folk songs(same melodies and probably words) at least that is what my history teacher told us and generally our history is common so I completely understand Ukranian struggles
Maybe we are not politically as close, but you will always have respect from Croats
You'd be surprised how much croatians want to consider themselves close to Italy
When i was in elementary school our geography teacher even taught us that we share a maritime border with Italy but still a border
The people in western and southern Croatia feel the closeness better than the rest of us especially the istriots
The thing is
Whether you see it or not, Croatia is your brotherly nation
We share a lot
History, cousine, coast(*cough, cough*), culture, we are both Slavs
Slovenia is always in Croatian news
First thing out new president did was visit Slovenia
Plus, I was suprised and pleased to hear how many people speak Croatian in Slovenia
I myself have learned a bit of Slovenian just for fun and to get around when visiting
The only issue in this whole relationship is the Slovenia itself
You guys always tend to isolate from everything
You are really good at it too
Maybe that's why you don't see it
Eaither way, best regards from Croatia
I'd still say Slovenia is more brotherly than Austria, if only because they're fellow Catholic Slavs who were also under Austrian rule and influence AND the fact that unlike most neighboring states in Europe, we've never had an armed conflict, at worst we bicker about undefined borders and take the piss out of each other online
And as for Austrian rule, we look back at it fondly NOW, back in the day we couldn't wait to break free from it
Well I feel no connection to Austria more Hungary especially here in Slavonia yes they were jack-asses and are sometimes now too but here we have a strong connection with them
I think universally we can all agree BiH is always close to us
Macedonia is also a good friend of ours
Remeber me
That would mean Serbia and Albania are brother countries
Conflict rates drop to zero
I think this is something a lot of people in our countries would agree is true
Ah yes
P I Č K I N    D I M
Serbo-Croatian is the best language in the world when it comes to curse words
True, true
I get that
I'm just saying tjat these days a lot of Croats find you as a really close nation
Vause Bosnia is controversial as only one part of Bosnia is considering us as brothers
the rest not so much
So, the closes thing we got is you
Sure
Like I said, I understand completely
Lately I learned that Austrians see Croatia as a friendly nation and do think of us from time to time (especially in the summer)
Which schocked me cause I thought they don't give a rat's a*s about any of the slavic nations
Hahah
Ha, we almost share word for that in Croatian, "kuverta" meaning "envelope". Is it the same in Spanish
Idk really our flag is pretty neat already tho I would change its proportions to be much longer like the one in Knin(   ) so we have the longest flag and it would be cool anyway
Also tho I like our tricolour maybe just the chequered field like in the Kingdom of Croatia or something similar to the one used in Austria-Hungary but I wouldn't mind staying it this way just a longer flag is what I want
We really missed a chance to modernise and change the flag to something that says we're a young nation, looking forward
Like [THIS] having both the colours AND the chequy
But we went with traditional flag with panslavic colours and coat of arms, which is okay i guess but it has a horrible crown element (literary made up by the first president and flag's designer) above the coat of arms, which is just tragically bad design, neither historical nor modern
Change it to the half is German and the other Croatian
Since we could probably make a country in .
I also prefer your flag with the emblem it just makes it better and more recognisable in the world
A lot of European flags look better with emblems on them, including yours
I definitely associate light green with Slovenia and wondered why you don't have it on your flag
I really like  the german flag where you  put the eagle in the middle, makes it feel more german
Is there a specific reason for wanting a longer flag
[Here's my redesign I would suggest, I think the main issue with our flag is the Dutch tricolor
Also I think the shield should look more like a shield and less like a pineapple
Make a lovley Manx couple :D
Plus, it would take away confusion with the Slovak flag
This is a cool design I like it maybe even more than any flag that we had, but the proportions should be like extra long because it would be awesome having a 20 meter long flag
I see what you did there
The trickster
It's not, no, but it is common for cuildren to financially help their patents due to low pensions
Maybe [Klepetan and Malena]
Eh, I don't know if it counts, but in Croatia the media goes nuts a couple of time per year about some damn stork that flies over and nests with the (supposedly) same female every year
Last year she seems to have cheated on him so he killed all her kids when he came back
Nature is really charming
Absolutely
They are always in the news with coundowns and speculations if he doesn't come back to her on time
Definitely nation's favourite couple
my american friend once said sung croatian sounds a lot like spanish
I've never been more offended
For Croatia it’s Russian with Italian accent according to people I’ve talked to (as an Uber in Croatia) but it might be different for Northern Croats
To me, it sounds like a Scot trying to speak German but he keeps randomly throwing words of Hebrew in
And sometimes Croats call you Psići (mean doggies but sure not derogatory) fot the same reason
lol
Can confirm
Also Serbs have a lot easier distinction between "Č" and "Ć" cause of your harsher pronounciation
While us Croats have a bit more difficulties hearing the difference
To us, everything is pronounced much softer
Russian sounds like it is being rewind backwards
Yes, I know about "hladno piće" ofc :)
Thank you Ireland and Germany for the jobs
Thank you to everybody for still visiting our coast despite the fact we are not "that cheap destination" anymore
Wish you all the best !
What are good neighbors for
I'll see myself out
What are good neighbors for
I'll see myself out
Really
Haven't heard many compliments on beers from Croatia
I'm glad you like it
U r welcome
Those fishes are ethnic Croats
Well that's an easy way to run away from responsibility
Blame Russia for it
Happy cake day !
Moomin TV show aired here
Really enjoyable even after all these years
There are many good beers in Croatia, but in my opinion, almost all of them are craft beers
Nice, didn't know about that
Yeah, it's a good beer
The company is owned by Heineken Croatia
We didn’t use to do that until a couple of years ago when some random man walked into our house
He claims he rang the bell, but we think he pressed the wrong switch (we have two switches next to the door; one is the bell, the other is the light switch for the light above the door)
So he just walked in, not waiting for anyone to answer
Mum was really freaked out, and we have been locking the door since then
It's normal to lock the door here
I live in a capital, so it's not exactly a matter of knowing all the neighbours
+ that doesn't always help either - I've had a break in once
Only during the night
Also, if I’m alone at home and need to take a shower, for instance, I would lock the door
Otherwise they’re unlocked during the day
locked since theres no huge benifit in leaveing it unlocked and no huge down side to locking it
I lock my house when I leave it and when I go to sleep at night
Otherwise, it's unlocked
I mean i would lock my doors anyway if im going somewhere, even if just for 5 mins
But not if im home
When I watched American shows and movies as a kid and the characters got locked out of their house or car I always found it so confusing lol, I've never had a door like that in my life

Good riddance
How is that not all over the world news
Is that normal or something
Holy fuck what have we come to
This is utterly depressing and gross
Freedom of speech is a basic human right and it's protection should be of highest priority
Croatia
I haven't seen it on the big portals front pages
I can't say I open them a lot but this should have been a big story
I don't know how I missed it
The biggest story in Croatia is, as always, a pitiful insult sharing between politicians
Our journalism is sad
Probably FER (Fakultet Elektronike i Racunarstva) basically university of electronics and computer science
Bigger countries, Poland
Just look other countries that size in Europe and how much worldwide known places you can see there
then look at Poland, what a big peace of nothing :(
Smaller countries, Baltic states, seem cold and depressive to me
EDIT:typo
I thought the same before I visited many German cities and states
Now it's my favourite European country
For someone who prefer german lager beers, those Belgian are disgusting, stronger and causes really bad hungover
Waffles are shitty sweets to me as well
sorry Belgium
“Boli me briga” literally means “my concern/care hurts” and it is *only* used sarcastically to denote you really don’t care
Not sure if it fits OP’s question but whatever
Ooh, same in Croatian
Saying something is "sranje" is always a bad thing
3 os seriously
Corrupt is my country’s middle name
Pretty corrupt
In Croatia, there is corruption in every segment of your life
Be it the hospital waiting list, politicians, police, getting a job etc
, whatever you do, you can't run away from this
Bribes, "party jobs", giving jobs to politician's friends and families, stealing money with purposely overpaid stuff wherever you go
This is due to HDZ's fame after winning the Independence War, and SDP's for Yugocentrics
Most people somehow became brainwashed to vote for them (or got a job through them), so they vote for these two constantly, that means there is absolutely no progress
Also, stats say most old people vote for these two corrupt parties
Which is kinda odd
We had a guy run for president who wanted to declare Croatia a corrupt zone and make corruption available to everyone (obviously a joke)
He's still at his stuff
Changing his name to Milan Bandić, Camping outside of Zagrebački Holding and handing out lamb, opening a road (iirc) and even made a reddit account (it's ZelimBitiMilanBandic iirc)
Oh, and if you're wondering, the guy's name is Dario Juričan
But yeah, he's just making fun of corruption otherwise it's obviously a big problem
If you don't have money or know someone (that knows someone), you might as well give up
I really doubt
Hard to believe that anything will change, as a president isn't too rightful, and was a prime minister a few years back, wasn't that great
I guess corruption is built in ourselves, idk
We should change tons of stuff to kill corruption
Too many townships, too many useless workplaces in statehood jobs etc
, if we fix that, maybe a part of corruption could be killed
Oliver Dragojević: Cesarica
I wish you independence to Kosovo, my friend
Jakov Gotovac - opera [Ero s onoga svijeta - What's that shining high in heaven]
Men: Višeslav, Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Zdeslav, Domagoj, Branimir, Muncimir, Domagoj, Tomislav, Krešimir, Miroslav, Mihovil, Stjepan, Svetoslav, Gojislav, Petar, Dmitar Zvonimir
Women: Jelena
Tbf a lot of those are used today as well
Not so sure about women, but men are fine
Even with several different national backgrounds, from germany to italy and hungary to slavic names
We would have:Tomislav,Borna, Trpimir, Držislav, Domagoj, Petar Krešmimir, Dmitar, peobably some others but can't remember and for girls maybe Tuga or Buga would count otherwise I don't know
Clodomir sounds weirdly Slavic
Yeah like the only ones that would earn you some weird looks are Muncimir, Svetoslav, and Gojislav
Rip girls tho
If you go past the Trpimirović's, you get some more names
Also, was Miroslav's wife called Margerita ?
Tuga and Buga don't count do they
Yes
Also, Stjepan’s wife was called Hicela and there is a queen Domaslava mentioned somewhere
They are mythical
But Buga actually is a women's name today
Rare, but it exists
Spongebob has a distinct northern/Zagreb style of speaking, Squidward speaks in a bland standard dialect, and Mr Krabs has an infamous Dalmatian islander accent and vocabulary, that group is most often stereotyped as being greedy in Croatian jokes
I just barely found an old clip, and my bad, Mr Krabs seems to have a Dalmatian *inland* accent, but that trope works as well because it is the home of stereotypical greasy "businessmen", it would be shtokavian although spongebob is definitely kajkavian
Patrick has a normal accent but its just very deep to sound idiotic, and my memory is bad but I think Luna also has a Dalmatian accent
Hard or soft Čokolino
I am in the hard camp, fight me
Is burek only with meat (true answer), or it can be with cheese, spinach, potatoes, apples (they are wrong)
Can you refer to the sea as water
For example hearing someone say "How's the water
/Kakva je voda
I'm going into the water
/Idem u vodu
" while I'm at the beach makes my eyes roll and I wanna punch someone
Aldi Süd has indisputably a better logo
Dense čokolino forever
you mean like č and ć?like doesnt the product packeging litterly say č
10000% biscuits
Ne, nego mislim na gusti ili rijetki Čokolino
Yeah i realised that when I typed it but I posted anyways because in english people can only say it that way (or it's the most common way)
I will try to explain
In Dalmatia, we will never call the sea water when refering to it though we all know that it is tehnically water
To us, we use the word water only to refer to water that you drink and shower in
For example, I would never say "I'm in the water
" when I'm swimming in the sea
I think it's connected with the sea having such a huge importance and impact on our lives
It gives us food, it's our main source of income
Calling it water, kinda diminishes it's importance
People from other parts of Croatia call it water and make me and many other people very annoyed while the think we are irational lol
I hope it's a bit clearer but I know it sound very confusing
a kužin nisan nikad jea čokolino samo san ga vidia u dućan pa san bia zbunjen
People from bigger countries not in Europe always try to compare Croatia to bigger countries they know in Europe because they don't know who/where the fuck we are
"Oh
is that like smaller Russia
"Do you guys canoe everywhere like in Italy
"Is that even a real place
Being known for just one tiny thing:
"Aha game of thrones right
"Oh a friend of a friend went to the beach there
super pretty
And the one that boils my blood the most is being called a third world country
It's never ever meant as just an innocent statement
It's always been some dickhole from the middle of nowhere America who thinks I'm weird and probably poor because I come from a smaller "third world country" and that it explains why I'm so out of touch with "all things America"
I've lived around the world, America is the only place where I've had someone actively try to start shit with me because I'm from a different country (usually gets worse when they find out I'm from a small country)
The first thing that comes to mind is size but also population and maybe territory, but i'm not sure about the last one
And I'll never forget Americans basically accusing me of lying about my language
Yes, it exists and yes, it sounds like that, you don't have to like it
And what do you mean tried to start shit with you
Like, "go back to your country" nonsense or
I would agree with you it's generally not an insult, I wouldn't have an issue with it but the part that bothers me is always what they say around the "third world country" statement
It's always something belittling, or  just insulting as all hell
Luckily I only had to deal with a handful of people like that
Telling me I was wrong about my country, where it was, or what the language was like
Saying stuff like "oh you're really clean for someone from a thrid world country"
And the classic "if you hate America go back to your shithole"  "you sure you aren't illegal
" "Drop the fake American accent you commie bitch" "are you here as a mail order bride or something
" "Must suck to be from a third world country, you must be so poor here"
What's funny about that is that I am actually considerably richer than they are
I just don't prounce around in Gucci so they think I must be poor (even though none of them do that
) And when they find out I'm not it's  "ugh, stupid rich internationals thinking they can pay their way in here"
Just to add this: I don't hate America, nor do I hate Americans
I don't agree with some things going on there, and I was unfortunately living in a very stereotypical conservative town where I was constantly shit on for not being American
But in general I have many friends in the US and I love it there
That's unbelievably ignorant and disrespectful
Honestly, I wouldn't feel comfortable going there as a tourist after hearing so many stories like this, and have such stuff happen to me and many others online
Nadam se da si sad među normalnijim, načitanijim ljudima
F for that one
Good to hear that's not a thing anymore
I hope you find someone who isn't that dense hahaha
The Croatian name for platypus is čudnovati kljunaš, which translates to _strange beaker_.
the only one i can think of is morski pas it means shark but littarly translates to sea dog
It wasn't just luck, you know
Otto von Habsburg settled in the US after France fell, and lobbied vigorously on behalf of Austria with the Allied leaders
He was quite liked by the Americans and by Roosevelt himself especially
The Pelješac bridge has been a legal battle between Croatia and Bosnia for a long time, it's currently being built though
Oh there are plenty of them
Zagreb university hospital, several roads, tunnels & bridges that lead to nowhere (for example Vukelićev most, most preko Drave or Omiš tunnel), Spaladium arena in Split, Sisak sports hall, Slijeme funicular in Zagreb (although it‘s under construction now) and so on
Pelješac bridge is the most famous one I think, but it‘s currently under construction by a Chinese company
Wow, this surprised me, and I see here a few countries don't have ID's. We have them here since I can remember
Since before I existed
:D They really make things easier
When I moved to Denmark for my studies few years ago was the time I realized or rather learned that many european countries do not have IDs or they do but it is definitely not **the** ID card rather something similar like in Denmark's case
It still makes very little sense to me as in Croatia it is mandatory to have one I believe when you turn 16 but, you can get it any time before that (babies can have them)
On the plus side, with them we can travel and live in almost all countires in Europe
Edit: we don't need passoport in Europe when we have ID cards, but need them outside of Europe
Dražica
an old female name
nowadays also means "clit". i stayed in a hotel of the same name
I guess Hermann and Heinrich get a pass
We have that in Serbo-Croatian, it's spelled Svetozar, mostly used by Serbs
Dactyloscopy (fingerprint identification), torpedo,  parachute, thermos bottle
But most known is probably tie
Azithromycin
Or perhaps remesdivir with which COVID-19 is treated nowadays
Torpedo as well
we share a ton of modern electricity with Serbia (Tesla)
Aside from that neckties, fountain pens, torpedos
Didn't Nikola Tesla make the radio
Austria then and austria now are 2 different countries tho
You had a formidable navy back then with my home town as it's main port
Just yesterday we were passing by some old artillery fortifications carved in the rock, right next to the main port entrance, they look awesome
Hmm weren't we also the first ones to quarantine people because of the plague in the 14th century
(In Dubrovnik)  not sure, though
Also a mechanical pen and first solid ink fountain pen - Slavoljub Penkala
MP3 player, Mobile pay for car parking, electric speedometer, dynamo
*Correction*: Fountain pens with **solid ink**. Not **the** fountain pens
What Penkala invented was also the mechanical pen
That was the first one
>Mobile pay for car parking
This was invented by Bandić himself, only to more easily squeeze the last lipa from our pockets
Parachute - 1617, Faust Vrancic, so early 17th c.
Withehaed was financing and working together with Ivan Luppis, so first torpedos were called Luppis-Whitehead
I'll give you fingerprinting, but all of South America has Vucetich's system of fingerprints classification
Glad he did that because Tesla didn't really have a lot money to do his works
He got his credit tho in the end
[Here they are]
To the left of it is the main entrance to Pula port and these bad guys guarded it together with a fortress in the woods which is not visible and overgrown
Here we tend to fix things when they stop working so rebuilding that one will take some years since its still functional
Military owns a huge chunk of that land and they have no interest in tourism, their focus is elsewhere
Altho, there were talks for years about them giving that land to the town so we could actually do something useful with all of that
That "platform" is not a platform, it's an artificial island which is a part of the shipyard uljanik, another big stone which is pulling us down since they're leaking money for years now
Imagine how the town would look without a big ass shipyard and derelict  military instalments in what should be the main tourist hub
Yes glad everyone got their credits in the end that is nice
There should be more cross-states banks
In the US if you're banking with one of the biggest banks, you can can get serviced anywhere in the country
In EU, there are only regional banks in few neighboring countries
Lots of things
Rails, plugs and army equipment are the most important I think
Well, on my uni in medicine field you need certain score that is calculated by the Q and IF of journal you pzblish in
So you could publish five papers in low ranking journals or you could go for one Immunity paper for example
And your mentor/PI is the person deciding that so you know from the start what you are putting yourself into
The cost of life would be better
Because for example, new minimal wage in switzerland will put you in like top 10% earners in most of eastern europe
Well there are still some people who consider themselves as Ustaše(Croatian nazis during ww2 who had a puppet state by the Germans) but generally yes people are called Ustaše as an insult for being too bossy sometimes and komunjara(Commie) is also used as an insult
Well, when you call a Croat "Ustaša" he will probably take it as an insult
If said by a Croat that would most likely be due to recepient's righ-wing views
If said by another ethnicity, the trigger can just as well be that you are a Croat
However, some edge lord teens far right-wingers may not object if they call themselves that (in private, in public not so often)
For most of people, yes
For some it's a mark of pride
There are also contexts in which the word "domobran/domobranski" can be used to denote cowardice, though that's a bit rare
(Domobrani were the regular army of the ww2 nazi puppet state, and were generally considered useless in combat
Though calling someone an Ustaša or a "komunjara" isn't an insult that's used outside of political contexts
You could hear someone being called "udbaš" (Yugoslav secret service member) in various contexts, though
Weren't the domobrani the Yugoslav army and not the puppet state army
No, Domobrani were the regular army of NDH
Ustaše were the (mostly) volunteer party militia
The Yugoslav army came out of the Partisans
There were also Domobrani in Austria-Hungary, those were the Croatian units of the army
Serious Sam - classic 90s FPS, a lot of sequels
SCUM - online zombie survival multiplayer
Doodle Jump - simple phone game
The Talos Principle - this is a real hidden gem from Croteam
When it comes to Croatia I think the biggest well known game within the older generations is Serious Sam and our most prominent "modern"/mobile game is Doodle Jump
At first I just saw "Czech journalist" and "-15 degrees C" and thought, "oh god, another one went to the Tatras in flip-flops
I’ve met 2 or 3 people who watched it, but AFAIK its’s practically unheard of in Croatia
I’ve been a massive fan ever since it came out and wish more people appreciated the masterpiece it is
Thank you Slovenia for not hating us
Fellow Europeans, I want to thank you all for your contributions to each other (and us)
There are many things to be thankful to those further away from us, but I'll stick to neighbours and those who were in contact with us more intensely
I want to thank Italy for their cultural influence on our coastal regions
It played a large role during our national revival in era of national awakenings in form of literary and cultural works
Thanks for the food aswell
I want to thank Austria for great architectural efforts during the monarchies
Their buildings stand to this day as one of finest in Croatia
The imperial court was also the most benevolent of foreign rulers we had, so thanks for that too
Thanks for pushing back Ottomans
We would've had a lot less land if you didn't.
I want to thank Hungary for playing game of thrones with us in the middle ages, it wasn't always pretty, but of all the countries that claimed our territory, you at least had decent claim to it
Thanks for enduring common hardships of the time with us(Mongols, Ottomans, Venice an the like)
Also goulash
I want to thank Slovenia for working together with us on Krško nuclear plant
It was built during Yugoslavia, but it's co-owned, maintained and used to this day
Much of Croatian potential has been squandered due to various mismanagements of policies or abuse of power and the people are quite doubtful we're capable of anything meaningful, but this common project shows otherwise
Thanks for being a bright example of how we can better arrange our country and society
I want to thank Bosnia and Herzegovina for their truly fine balkan music
Any way you prefer, be it traditional coutry music, turbofolk, (yugo-)rock, rap or other contemporary genres, it's emotional, but direct, right on target
Thanks for being a nation of jokers and poets, offering everyone around you a laugh and brightening the mood of sometimes cloudy Balkans
Thanks for burek
I want to thank Serbia for those brief moments of cooperation when the pressure and stakes were highest
Together we managed to pull something out of otherwise impossible situation (I am reffering to both yugoslav initiatives at their eary days, when the world was bearing down on us, but also to their refugees, who settled Ottoman borderlands and fought to halt their advance)
I want to thank Serbia for different (eastern) outlook of our similar culture
There are many things mystical and intoxicating about you and it's refreshing from time to time to see something cultural come out of the east
Their music works similarly to what I wrote about B&H, except it's more intense, fiery
And thanks for čevapi and pljeskavica
Finally, I want to thank Montenegro for having the least trouble with us
The relationship between us has always been pretty chill (except briefly during the 90-s siege of Dubrovnik, but I think we can move on from that)
Your drowsy reputation is hillarious and charming at the same time and it's a very positive (albeit passive) effect of having no issues with you as one of ex-yu nations
Yeah, me too
Lol, psyche, we slaughtered each other recently
Why not Russia
Russia supported the unification of Germany, ironically enough France and the UK were the most opposed
We will gladly steal Cockta from slovenians ;)
But Cedevita is a thing and Pipi is back at it
I made a whole post about prople not having Cockta or Schweppes Tangerine, so, those 2
Let's go Cockta
It is a carbonated drink like coke but with some herbs added to it and with its special touch
Better than Coca-Cola or pepsi if you ask me
It is produced in Slovenia but is widely consumed in the Balkans
Cedevita is absolute masterrace drink, I regularly pimp it to my friends here in the UK, so far 100% satisfaction rates across all cultures that have tasted it, especially in the summer
We should deffo export it more
Old yugo version of fanta
Cockta is so fricking good
Not at all
Talking about dictatorships is by far the favorite topic whenever any elections are nearby
I play in English, but if there an option for my language I'll at least see how good it is
They're mostly really bad, mainly because a lot of wordplay,puns and jokes don't work in Croatian, and it's hard to translate them
Always english subs but if the main language of the game is something else I play it with that one
Like final fantasy always stays japanes and english sub
I would rather play in Croatian if it's possible
I don't think that many games have Croatian language as an option
Well rural people aren't respected in Croatia as much as they should be
Generally they are viewed as poor simpletons by the stereotype
Of course not all of Croatia sees it that way this is what I think people might think
I only speak Croatian and English and I know that that isn't enough
I have never seen these in my life, on the internet, or in real life
But it can probably be made regularly, because croatia gets lots of snow and ice
Well I think any bigger explosion in Vukovar could be it, it was probably a competition who can make the biggest explosion in the city
Also it is Croatian victory day today :D
Pretty much all Serbian people I've met were legitimately awesome, warm, funny people
Most of Slovenians too
Hell, they've been far more friendly to me than a lot of people from other Croatian cities
I agree with everything you said
Love all our neighbours and whole Europe and our similarities and differences, best place to live
Thank you, brother
We love you to️
I LOVE milk, but haven’t drunk it since February
My skin flares up when I drink it
Can confirm - I love milk
Have at least 600ml every day
That might or might not be the best for me lol
We say "u tri pičke materine" meaning :"in three mothers pussies"
I guess Croatians would use the made up village name "Vukojebina" for that, which roughly translates to a place where wolves fuck
XD It's often used as an insult too, when you want to point out that someone is a hick from a rural area, you'd say he came from some Vukojebina
Edit: I just remembered, we also have another way to imply something being far away and/or in the middle of nowhere, we'll say the place is "u pizdi materini", which means it's "in mother's cunt". XD
Zanzibar is also worth mentioning
Aw crap
For years I've been pedantly correcting my friends and family members whenever they referred to Italians as *froggers*. I'd say something like "no man, Frenchies eat frog legs they're the froggers, Italians are *digimons*!"
My world veiw is shattered
Italians also have [a Fritzl
>someone give this guy a medal, i'm poor lol
don't worry, we are all gonna become poor soon enough
To add to all thing mentioned before, in many places local ground doesnt allow tall buildings to be built easily
There are often tunnels and remains of older buildings and foundations
Old city centres are typically too crowded to allow space and infrastructure needed for such buildings, and, especcially if only a single building is done it strongly affects the panorama of the city
To build more, it's easier to go to the outskirts and do as you wish (like they did at paris, madrid or moscow), rather thsn cram huge buildings into streets that cant fit or support them
Yeah, I wanted PVC windows and guess who forbid me to put them
My own father, then he started with rules
Taht's what happens when technician is your father
That's the point, nobody cares except my father and that's why I have wooden windows
I hate wooden windows
I have the new ones, absolute shit, his best man made them
Aluminium ones are also option, u til you hit head on the edge of one of them
Tko se nije skril, magarac je bil
if you mean specifically hide-and-seek, "Tko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
" sung out
(Who has not hidden, he is a donkey)
Do you mean whats used in hide and seek game
Tko se nije skrio magarac je bio - whoever didn't hide is a donkey
Tko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
( Who didnt hide is a donkey)
"'Ko se nije skrio, magarac je bio
" literal translation: "Who hasn't hidden was a donkey
Tko se nije skrio magarac je bio
(Who didn't hide is a donkey)
Wow, here in Croatian we call that place "Pik". I wonder where those words come from
Tko se nije skrioooo, magarac je bioooo :D
Croatians too
The Croatian Language Portal (Hrvatski jezični portal) says that it comes from French "pique" which means supposedly means "tip of a spear". I don't know how true it is but it is the only thing I could find
To me, personally, it'd be weird if someone from Serbia, Bosnia or Montenegro tried to use some of the exclusively Croatian words that exist in our language
Especially because most of the words that are different are still well known in all countries, so for example, while Croatians don't use the words hljeb, pantalone or šargarepa ("bread", "pants" and "carrot"), most people here know what they mean
I mean I imagine it would be strange to hear someone try to speak like a local and it would probably just be best to speak how they normaly speak unless people are having a hard time understanding them
Well all former yugoslav countries speak the same languages except slovenia and macedonia and no we dont mind at all we joke about other country words and its funny af
I think it is far more wierd for Serbs to use Croatian words
I think its same both ways
Regarding Serbia I don't understand the people that support certain politicians that were active during and after the war in the 90ies (primarily Slobodan Milosevic)
They made some choices leading to the death of many people on both sides including some horrific ordeals like the Srebrenica massacre
I love visiting Serbia and I really like the people there, however, some straight up deny things that happened in the war even though there are tons of evidence
Also once I saw a "Kosovo je Srbija" comment on a random American pastry Youtube video
I remember Paragon guild from wow was Finnish only guild and they were the top guild for few years
Oh yeah
remember that time when they all were saying:
>Football is comming home
Hahahahahaha
Classic English
Which is why there was so much schadenfreude when we beat them in the WC
As someone who was in the UK during the time, the insistent pestering with "it's coming home" and constant condescendion towards our national team by the pundits really grinded my gear
It came to no surprise that most of the world celebrated Croatias victory but I was surrounded with shocked Englishmen saying "I don't understand why no one likes us"
> I don't understand the people that
Here I definitely didn't mean all Serbians, but of course only the ones who do support such politicians
You are completely right about Franjo Tuđman and others like him
Some people do think he did good, but tbh it's mostly old "babe" in their 60ies and 70ies
He made some terrible decision, especially by the end of the war, which led to a lot of deaths
... that had nothing to do with support
There were some nasty stuff said about Croatia in English media and insults were thrown at our team
That, my dear coredditor, that is the arrogance we are talking about
Don't bulls*it further
Please
Don't make me go nitpicking
If we go down this rabbit whole then I can pull the argument that you guys, English, are The Worst tourists we have ever seen
So much mess involving you
But, I won't. Cause I actually like England
Believe it or not
Puahahahhaha
My God
you truly justify the claim now
You're being arogant
You see, if you just did yourself a favour and thought through a little bit before writing, we would have been in the wrong
Yet you proved us right
>bullshit unjustified xenophobic twattery
Tit
And that is not arrogance
Oh please
What exactly was a bigoted lie there
As a Croatian, I assure you that the British tourists are the least liked tourist group in my country
we literally call toothpaste "kalodont" after a brand that was widespread during yugo times
there's also the word for bandaid (hanzaplast) however it's become less common, mosr people use "flaster" which to my knowledge has no brand
Digitron is an electronics company that has become synonimous with Cauculators some people use  Digitron to mean Cauculator
Also Cedevita, for all vitamin drinks (powder + water)
We have it oficially as "sušilo za kosu" (hair dryer), but unoficially use "fen".
personally no, but i also have to admit i really haven't seen any powder vitamin drinks other than cedevita
figures
There are a lot of Cedevita copies you can find in stores
In Croatian dragon and kite are both "Zmaj". Pretty sure it's like that in Serbian, but feel free to correct me
The Croatian word for both kite and dragon is ''Zmaj''
Is zmij a viper or a snake tho
Ah ok, so a rattlesnake is zmij but a black mamba is had
Interesting
Oh, i'm not talking about the specific name for the rattlesnake, i'm talking about the name for the group in which rattlesnakes are in (vipers)
While cobras ans black mambas aren't vipers
So my question was is zmij a viper or just a venomous snake
Meh, to complicted for me to get into it but intresting never the less
And the word you're looking for is "constrictors" i believe
Well, to be frank, both Fanfare Ciocarlia and Goran Bregovic play brass-band music, so maybe he was relating more than confusing it
Dunno, just playing devil's advocate here
But yeah, any foreigner who would tell me he knows about Croatia and croatian culture better than me would have an earful
I mean Croatia is usually just the coatline, national parks and the capital Zagreb so the "videk" here is usually the east part of the country(Slavonia)
So people just have a general feel for Slavonia being the poor part looked down on even tho it is the best part of the country but I'm biased here since I live here
Yeah, the way you describe Greeks all over London was my experience with northern Balkan people throughout Germany (and a little bit in Austria)
You sit down in a restaurant and comment with your friends about how you're holding in a monster fart, when the waiter asks you "what will you drink" in a perfect Herzegovinian dialect
"Coffee with milk and a glass of water, and can you point me towards the toilet
For a bit of mind-blowing, google "Texasdeutsch".
In Croatia, *especially* if near the border, people very often go to Bosnia and Herzegovina
Reason is cause everything is cheaper there
So, we go for drinks, ćevapi (a type of local dish), pancakes, cheap swimming pools, we go to shopping there and for cheap gas and cigarettes
A lot of people study there as well, but they still keep on living in Croatia
They only commute to B&H. Though, there is still a proper border check and you could end up waiting even for an hour at the border, people still cross daily no matter
It is also very common for those sho live in Bosnia to commute to  Croatia
Either for the studies or work
Or in coastal areas for the day trip to tbe beach
In Eastern Slavonia (a region in Croatia) people also like to travel for day trips to Novi Sad and Belgrade in Serbia
Those are usually for night life and cheap drinks
Edit: And how could I forget our dear neighbours, Slovenia
I know quite a few people who travel there for work
So, they live in Croatia, but during the work week they stay (basically live) and work in Slovenia (mostly Ljubljana - the capital)
And during the weekends they come back and spend free time with family and friends
The drive between the Ljubljana and northern croatian cities is around 2 hours, so not a long drive at all
Also, many people study in Slovenia as well, so they have to commute there daily
Yeah its pretty normal for example my aunt and uncle go to Hungary every once in a while to buy groceries because some stuff is cheaper there
Everytime we're having parties we go to Hungary and buy cheap sodas, I know people near Bosnia go there for petrol and Serbia has cheaper shoes
Hungary is like 10km from my town so we go there pretty often and Serbia is not far either if I need some new shoes
Hungary is also pretty useful because they have Tesco and Aldi
Only thing is we're not in the Schengen area so we have to have ID cards to cross but it doesn't take long
18€???????? Thats almost an entire full priced Paradox DLC
Dont you guys like not have ID because it infringes on a small percentage of the population's "freedom". You have the social security thingy right
Yeah I heard you guys take ferries to Estonia for cheaper alcohol
And Estonians to Latvia (when does the cycle end
Always wondered why we use helicopter when we have a perfectly normal croatian word for it: zrakomlat (literally "the thing that beats up air")
In Croatia we don't have our own word for colour
The word "boja" comes from Turkey
Some regions in Croatia also use the words farba (from german) and pitura (from italian)
Hey, we have huncut (in some places funcut or vuncut) as well
I never knew my grandpa was calling me dog's vagina when I misbehaved
Doesn't "ćuprija" mean "bridge"?
Because it sounds ridiculous, like most "normal Croatian words" that are promoted by idiotic language purists
And here Motorola turned into an eponim meaning any kind of walkie talkie or also bastardized to Voki Toki
Yes
At least in Croatian as far as I know and our online dictionary says, ćuprija=most and there is no other meaning for it
German, most of the people learn German as second foreign language in school
But also Italian, specifically in Istria region it's second official language
German
Some schools have German as their first second language too especially in the central and northern part
Other stuff is Italian on the west side in Istria as the first second and that is about it
So the most spoken second languages are German in the majority and Italian in the minority
Write it as two seperate thigns, please and thank you very much our dear neighbour
:) hahah
Correct
Most of continental parts of Croatia speak German as 2nd or 3rd language and most of the coats speaks Italian
Both langaugaes are widely taught in schools and used to communicate with tourists during summer season
we are taught from the birth to work in touristic branches
Quite popular among <35 people
I'd say most younger people smoke it every now and then
Very popular among younger people
But some people look at it like fucking heroin
I think legalisation would benefit out country greatly
And when done in moderation it is a safe drug
In 10-20 years it will be legalised everywhere in the world
Why not be one of the first ones
The way words are pronounced (each letter makes the same sound everytime) makes this impossible to happen
Not really
Speak as you write language and all
The most problematic would be finding out if someone has a j in the name or not, eg Mija or Mia, Andreja or Andrea, Marijo or Mario
Something similar in croatian would be names like: Matea/Mateja
You don't really hear the difference in those names in everyday speach
Well, actually, there are names that can be written with or without a j, but the pronunciation doesn't change, such as Antonia/Antonija, Mario/Marijo, Dario/Darijo, etc
It is the same letter as Croatian "Dž".
"Dž" is also spelled with multiple letters but seen as one and pronounced as one
"Sh-ch-y" I think
Someone correct me if I am wrong
Yes
I tried to spell it in English
If you want, I can spell it in German: Sch-Tsch-i
Edit: I forgot you guys use very similar alphabet like we do and read the letters the same way
Lol pretty cool
"Rz" is like Croatian "Ž". Same thing
Hahahahah
But bro, only 3 letters of those "special ones" in our alphabet are written with two characters
Those are: nj, lj, and dž.
The rest are normal: š, č, ć, ž, đ
Is there a slight difference in the pronounciation between RZ and Ż, U and Ó?
I have a suggestion
Why don't you guys adopt an alphabet we (Croatians) have and the world will be at peace
Much easier
We literally have the same sounds, minus-plus one or two
Damn, I knew the Japanese didn't like foreigners, but I really didn't think it'd be that bad
I'm glad your daughter is alright
I mean, yes, but actually no
This is sort of a stupid question for Europe
It's a relativley small "continent" holding a relativley large amount of people
But in Croatia at least you could get areas like that but it would be rather difficult to find
Nontheless we have very beautiful nature and gorgeous landscapes and it's something I personally take a lot of pride in
Depends on your definition
But I believe it should be possible for large swaths of Lika/Dinara/Velebit are
Probably not but we have mountains which are really sparsely populated and I think you can easily get lost there but to live like in total isolation I think not because it is too small
Other places like our mountains are some forests inland where you can get absolutely lost and of course if you would live on a ship in the middle of the Adriatic
Well sort of, there are parts of my country that are very poorly populated , but I think that you can't get more isolated then an hour ride
Except if you decide to live on one of hundreds uninhabited islands
Probably depends on the area
I wouldn't say you're always 100% safe
But mines are less of a problem here than say Bosnia
i would love to rad that story, in english if possible
We had a [prime minister] who was born in Nazi labour camp in Germany
I don't think it was held against him
On the other hand we also had a [prime minister] who was Croatian Canadian (born in Zagreb though), not even elected but agreed upon by a coalition, his struggle with language and his gaffes were often joked about (he started his mandate by saying "he will serve the buildings" instead of citizens - *građevine/građani*; and once for a punchline in a speech he obviously google-translated word by word "keep calm and govern on" with "*ostati mirni i vladaju na*" which made absolutely no sense) but I wouldn't say he was disliked for it
Quite controversial
Incredibly so if it was ex-Yu
Maybe the only option that could be perceived as good is Germany/Switzerland/Fennoscandia
The rest is varying amount of outrage
Other race would blow heads
Dont forget the long reigning duke of nepotism, milan bandic
He's not a head of state per se but is our capital's mayor and has been for 15 years
He is from bosnia and herzegovina, he moved to zagreb in his early 20s.
TBH he quite often gets called out for that
Never liked that
Just like I never liked him
No, Prime minister has far more power then president in Croatia
I don't know about the Hungarian Index, but the Croatian one is trash
It's anti government for sure but very trash
I don't think we had any continous long lasting friends
Hasn’t Ukraine been chummy lately with Croatia
That's actually true when you think about it
We have no long lasting friends :(
Actually what is weird, in start we had pretty good relations with Serbs, we even helped (saved) them with their war against Simeon I, at that time we also had alliance with Byzantines
There is some really interesting information here
I would put you guys as our potential best friend (if we aren't right now)
True was just wondering if anything had changed since I heard last
>I always considered Liechtenstein as our 27th canton
Is that why you are always invading them
I still don't get why do you chuckle at this conception
This "random english words" conception is very common in Croatia, and stores like C&A, Kik, H&M and NewYorker sell those shirts on a regular basis
Nobody pays attention to what those words say, it's important that they have sone graphic, because plain shirts are out of fashion
I have tonnes of them at home, I could photograph them if you want
That is because there are no standards for those shirts
Any combination of English words that sort of make sense are printed on those shirts
As we're speaking, I am wearing a "denim manufacturing company USA" shirt
Luxurious places are also added here, but anything will do
We have zero standards
barely any puns (it's hard to make them) but when they exist they're the funniest shit ever
otherwise, a lot of sarcasm, hyperbole, and dry delivery humor
shock humor is also popular
Literally the country bumpkin stereotype of "Haha crude stuff funny"
AKA if the joke has shit, sex, or something extremely gross it's "funny" but if you have to think about the joke it's lame and you're being a nerd or something
(This is my own experience with it, might be different for others)
Country is Croatia
I guess thats European humour

(sorry)
Meet Milan Bandić, our immortal and undefeated 30-year-reigning grand master of corruption, mayor of Zagreb, our capital
He has no voice left
He speaks like a chicken that is being strangled to death, he's been on many surgeries, he looks 15 years older than he is
Switching 2 parties, making his own, a true master of shameless political trade
A guy has commited 5 years of his life to making a movie about his corruption-filled reign, and Bandić shows up to the premiere, says the movie is trash, doesn't even watch it, leaves
He isn't giving up without a fight
Why is he so persistent
Money and crime are the answers
He and his friends, mistresses and cousins have stolen godknows how much of our money and years of what would have been progress
If we don't dunk him next year I'm going to be more than disappointed
Bandić is the sole reason I miss death penalty
Where were you in '91 ?
>joke was Ursula von der Leyen
Why her
Pelješki most here
Megoslav
No, yougoslav
I see
Our media doesn't seem to criticize any bigshot name from the EU in general
It's a surprise to see people from Germany have a negative sentiment towards her
So Romanians are both vampires and hobbits
I read about EU and EU member states politics almost as much as domestic ones
I don't follow them that closely but I know for example which parties hold the governments (maybe not every by name but by which EU parliament group they belong to and that gets me close enough to what kind of politics they stand for)
I also get the latest big news from all European countries in euractiv's newsletter 'Capitals'.
I mostly follow ours, but also this year I've been closely following the Belarus protests
Also the occasional nuggets of EU news and news from other countries
I know only about some in my town (Dubrovnik)
Island of Daksa is an small island on which dozens of priests and people that were against fascist regime were executed
There are a few abandoned hotels and houses that are kinda scary
A body was found latley in one of the houses
Villa rašica is a villa where satanists are doing their rites and sacrefices

Happy birthday
What about leaving it on the floor or throwing it in the trash infront of some kids
Croatia
We have hundreds of political parties, but only a few are relevant
Two largest political parties are Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica - HDZ (ruling party, moved from right wing to right wing-center recently) and SDP - Socijal demokratska partija (moderate left wing)
Both are pro EU, heavily clientelistic and support state interventionism
They differ in ideologies a bit; HDZ is more conservative and SDP more liberal
Together, they hold 2/3 of our parliament
Other notable players:
Domovinski pokret - far right, assembled around famous folk singer, mostly famous for their anti-communist, anti-Serbian, anti-gay rhetoric
Možemo - new political party, formed by former green activist, focus their efforts on fighting corruption in our capital
Controversial because of their collaboration with smaller far left parties
Fokus/Pametno - also new party, liberals
Most - right wing clerical populist, became famous as non-ideological party fighting agaist corruption
Živi Zid - populists, anti-vax, anti-immigrant, anti-EU, very famous in one period but not in the parliament anymore
EDIT: Thx u/carrottossy for the reminder
There is also Most (Most nezavisnih lista) but I don't really understand what they are
In Croatia, standard is to have just FIRST NAME + LAST NAME
I don't think the law recognizes Middle names at all
However, the law about personal names says that you can have up to two words for each category
They can be written with a dash or without the dash
standard: Ivan Horvat
maximum: Ema Lorena Franić Stanić
First name + Last name
Sometimes we have two first names, but we don't use middle names and we don't consider the second first name a middle name
One name and one surname (usually paternal) is the norm
Occasionally people will have two names and married women can have two surnames (and in turn carry that to their children)
Anything more than that is highly unusual
Its same in croatia
I will add that catholics upon baptism get baptismal name that is derived from the day you're born and saint or same as your godfather or godmother
its not formal name but is name that catholic church recognize you by and keep in  their books
Because during the time the mass killings and atrocities were happening Congo was not a Belgian colony and the Belgian government had no control of it
It was called the Congo Free State and it was the personal property of King Leopold
Belgium later annexed the colony **specifically to end** all the shit that was happening
So I see absolutely no reason why the Belgian government would apologize for something it didn't do
If anyone then the royal family
I would've gone blind and probably died as a kid
Same, mine made one of the first shipyards in Croatia in the 18th century, so I'd probably be a sailor which isnt too far off what I am doing now
But it sucked more for gay people
I’ve been told as a kid that Santa lived in Rovaniemi, Finland
In Croatia, Santa lives in the Lappi region of Finland
Croatian tradition says that Santa lives in a state or city treasury
You have to be a member of a party, do what you are told the whole year, he is making a list, checking it twice, and then you get lucrative contracts so you can buy yourself whatever you want
The downside is that a significant percentage of cash goes under the table back to Santa
There is a spin off after the new testament called game of thrones
That we drive on left side in Croatia
he was an american
Last year, as a part of Croatia's big reform of education system, they printed a new set of textbooks for schools, with QR codes for interactive learning
Together with that, the government ordered tablets for schools, so teachers and kids can easily scan QR codes and gain access to materials
Here's the good part - **around 6000 tablets they bought didn't have cameras
Today in our highschool we tried reinstalling Windows xp, it didn't work
Why would that be embarrassing, XP is quality
This has Balkans written all over it
I feel like I'm in a parallel universe where we're better than you in at least something lol
honestly
swear words
"shall you get fucked by a block of ice" doesn't roll off the tongue that well
In Croatia it's most of the cash grab condos and appartment complexes for rent to tourists during the summer
They are usually right by the sea, and 90% of them are monstrosities that should have never been built
This [ugly] thing that destroyed the baroque architecture around it
Also, I despise this [building
Yes
Because of the Treaties Croatia signed with Vatican i think
Yes, but you don't learn just about Catholicism but about other religions in the world as well, and you discuss stuff
Also, it is really easy to get a good grade and that automatically boosts your average
In high school you choose between religion and ethics, and most people take ethics, whereas in primary school you just have religion and you can either take it or write to the school that you want to drop the class (mostly kids who are not Catholic do that, everyone else takes it because it's easy)
Yes, but as an elective subject
I'm not happy with what they teach kids in religion classes, I think the church should have no say in the education of our children, but it is what it is
And we make atheists pay churches through the taxes
Varaždin used to be capital of Croatia until the big fire torn it down
Zagreb was capital city since then
However, I would propose the baroque city of Karlovac to be new capital of Croatia
Karlovac is smaller and more centrally located in terms of geography
It's old city center is a bastion in shape of a star with nice orthogonal street blocks
The center of Karlovac is now somewhat forgotten and sad, with a lot of ruined buildings
I think it could be renewed with both classical and new contemporary buildings to make use for all central governemt needs
Brasov is a good central option don't you think
Nice city too as I heard
I'd pick Osijek, since the region would get an economic boost probably
Only con I can see is it's distance to the border with Serbia
And you don't know what's going to happen there regarding their politics
Karlovac is close to both borders which is unsafe but our whole position is unsafe
Further to the coast is safer but the other part of the country would be very outshined which is why Zagreb is a perfect location
Other than Zagreb maybe Bjelovar do
Zagreb is also close to the border
You can't find a city which isn't close to the border but Karlovac is close to 2 borders which is easily occupied
When war comes we should just move capitals depending on who is attacking
More than you'd think, actually
Just because of our neighbour countries wanting to get in, but we kinda have to agree to that, but we don't, it's all very confusing
Our country is very important in tourism aspect
It provides a safe, beautiful and affordable place for our fellow Europeans to spend their long awaited vacation
It is also (imo) a prime example of how to be patriotic and truly love what is our own, but still be part of the bigger family and respecting that aspect of it as well
Hmm you have given me an idea
The EU doesn't really care about your system of government as long as your country more or less follows the EU's strategic goals
And thank you for that, French leadership on these things has been great
If only others would follow
And it will be even more confusing in years to come
Unfortunately, yes
:-(
Its not free, we pay it through taxes
Better word to use is universal
Every system has its downsides
Ours would be longer waiting times if you are not an emergency case
But the good thing is that private healthcare is pretty affordable due to universal healthcare because if it was too expensive, nobody would use it
So if you dont want to wait, you can go private and pay
But if you have cancer or some serious condition, you will get care as soon as possible
Regular check-ups are the one you have to wait for a little bit longer
I would say that american healthcare is under bigger political influence because people make huge money out of it and there political parties are divided on this subject
In Europe, political parties pretty much have a consensus on the way healthcare should be
Not true that only two societies treat non residents
We had a lot of immigrants who were hurt illegaly crossing our country and they received instant care without any payment
Also there are a lot of situation in which tourists were injured and they also received care immidately without big bills
They paid the same as we residents would if we didnt have coverage
Oh, you meant that kind of things
Yes, I agree
Its the same here
Basque language sounds like a Spaniard speaking an encrypted version of spanish
Its flow of speech is the same as spanish, it uses same phonemes as spanish, but it replaces just about any spanish word with a completely different word
you a Serb or Montenegrin
I know that japanese does it
which other languages put their last name up front
I never thought Portugese sounds anything like Russian
However, keep in mind my first language is Slavic, so it's pretty easy for me to differentiace Slavic from other languages
And as for Portugese - I love the language, it's so, so beautiful
When you guys pronounce your 'r's it sounds like you're trying to gather saliva in your mouth for a nasty spit

"Basic school"
Get up at 07:30 rush to get to school till 08:00, I did not much like to go to school
Lessons were 45 mins long with pauses of 5 mins and 2 longer ones for eating after 3th lesson and 4th
Class 1-4 would eat at cantina after 3th lesson while class 5-8 would eat after 4th lesson
Also got beaten up a lot that is why I did not like it
"High school"
Basicly the same thing just we had 2 shifts cuz there were too many kids so it started at 08:00 and 14:00 sometimes ealier I had to take a bus there 25 km
bus went at 06:15 and 12:15, I had to wake up early when I was 1st shift at lest I was liked here and none beated me up I loved high school wish I could go back
"Uni"
I was only here cupple months seen it was not for me and I droped out
Too many stuck up profesors tbh would just sit at desk and show you PDF
Not every Uni probably
Croatia
It's the same in Croatia but we had our lunch break after the 3rd period

How did he taste

But for real, the 2nd president of independent Croatia (Stjepan Mesić) also agreed to have presidential powers limited, and even argued for that move

Well, that's a shame
Same in Croatia
Every year there's Home Alone on TV
From Croatia
No, we have such diverse facial and hair features that you can see blond, redhead, brown, and black haired and complections fair and dark and between
In a country just above 4 million population
just in my family, we have blonds dark-hair, blue, green, hazel and brown eyes
Tall, short
In my part of the country people are really tall, some of the tallest people in Europe, that is really obvious seeing most women are above 170 cmheight
Me being 185 cm tall man am average hight here
I went to highschool in northern partt of country where I was above average tall
I like that diversity, its cool
we dont have African or Asian descent people here though (very small percentage) and you will not see that kind diversity even in the capital
Sometimes when whatching british series, white people look the same stereotip is noticable for me, LOL
To me Hugh Grant and Robert Pattinson absolutely scream English
I disagree, maybe people from regions of the country look somewhat different but I looked around this thread and most people from the other countries are very visibly NOT Croatian, and I live in Dalmatia and during the summer it's generally not that hard to tell apart natives and tourists, just by facial features alone
Also, what I noticed after moving abroad is that a lot of girls in Croatia don't wear that much makeup at all
It could be considered "light" by a lot of standards, and that guys dress [nicely]
This
You can perhaps tell them apart only in regards to fashion and make up
I know for instance that girls in Croatia don't wear a lot of make up, while in certain other countries that is not the case, but then again you can always find that one girl who looks up to a certain country (USA or other) for fashion influences and who will look like that
So you are 100% right
You’ve never heard about the Czechs
You forgot about nightly towel invasion of beaches
I disagree with you
For instance, [she] is from the northern part of Croatia, but I bet that a lot of other nations with lighter skin tones and light hair colors would be able to say that she "belongs" to them
Just like [her] who is from the south
Also, [Ivana Brkic] looks nothing like a south/east European, or something that you would say is "basic" Croatian at first glance
(I am using celebrities as examples because I don't want to post pictures of random people here)
But then you have this [look] that's a bit darker, or this [one] I don't think that there are facial features that are just Croatian, but we could distinguish one another in style, manners, walk, etc
Every single person in these pictures is Croatian, but yet again each one has its own distinctive facial features
I cannot say, what my admitedly subjective opinion is that Crot women are really good looking
I think that do wear less makeup tha Serbian women, which are also pretty, but they have stronger Turbofolk (trashy faux folk music and scene) culture that is like 'more the better' , and unnatural look is what they are going for
to be honest turbofolk is popular in Croatia too, but I think that girls in casual and everyday life wear less makeup but weekend you can see all sorts of
crazy
Also in such a small country there are lot of temperament and 'lifestyle' differences between different regions
My mother's side of the family is fair skinned and light eyed but my father is dark haired
I am pretty much blond but I have brown eyes
My friend for example trough the winter is pretty pale but  tan easily in summer, he has prominent nose so if he were to travel in U.S. it believe that people would give him the eye because he could pass as Arab
His half sister is blue eyed and ashen hair
Funny that
Genetics
They all have big heads
You mean five heads heh
I would say so, yes
Just in my small town theres alot of girls and women that are apsolutly stunning and since I live in touristy place I heared lot of foriegners expressing their amazment of how many good looking people they see here
I can always recognize foriegners and in many cases guess where there from easily
Dubrovnik
The town of game of thrones, the big walls and UNESCO heritage site makes it every year a place where you can't walk through because of all the tourists
Everything is expensive there too
Hmm
Most of the coast is very touristy, with addition of Plitvice Lakes
I'd say northern Croatian coast has way too many tourists for its capacity at normal years
Dubrovnik, tho, is way overcrowded
Main area has maybe a square kilometre and probably around 50k people at every second
Probably more
Area around Salzburg and the south of Austria is also very nice
Istria actually gets more visitors as the other reply said but Dubrovnik itself gets a bunch and Istria as a whole gets more
Glad you liked Umag I went there too and it was a fun time
Anything can really be a souvenir especially if you find some souvenir things for free
Yeah, in Dalmatia you can find peaceful places you can actually rest in, unlike places like Dubrovnik, Rovinj, Plitvice Lakes which are overcrowded with people, and imo, there should be regulations in Dubrovnik for Old Town entry (Stradun area) since it is so overcrowded you can barely walk there
Not even expensive parking lots and apartments can stop people from coming
I'm not saying it is bad to have a lot of tourists, however, when you can't walk at all it becomes annoying
I'd say Dubrovnik's Old Town is so dense with people in summer it beats any other place on Earth lol
That's what happens when you have an old, preserved city which was once a powerful city-state
Just don't go to main tourist places if you like peace
Istria is full of people wherever you go, Kvarner is full of cheap and annoying, monotone tourists (except Opatija maybe), Dalmatia is huge so there will be a lot of non-touristy places which is nice
Islands are somewhat touristy, and in the end, Dubrovnik is way too overcrowded and needs more regulations imo
Alps are stunning
Coming there in May, it still had snow and it was the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen in my life
Well, I know that Minnesota is not Michigan, which surpasses the knowledge of Trump's lawyers
I would know to point 4/5ths of all states, New england being the problem except Vermont and Massachusetts,I know their shape
I know capitals of around half of all states, New England again being a problem, Pennysylvania, North and South Carolina, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Oregon and Washington state, I never bothered to learn their capitals nor I had a chance to hear about them
For example I'd like to visit western US (without oregon, washington and california)
Chayenne because it's a biggest rodeo, 3 states that make up Yellowstone so naruelly I heard about these and know their capitals

It is terrible
It is (or was until recently
) moderated by far right mods so any article related to history, sociology, politics etc
is by definition bad and full of bias at best and blatant lies and fabrications at worst
History articles are heavily biased and are casually trying to show that nazi puppet state was a good thing
I think it is ok but nowhere near as good as the English one
I automatically avoid the croatian wikipedia or "wikipedija"
In most places yes but I believe some places have pretty bad infrastructure so tap water isn't exactly drinking water

From the first word I knew it was gonna be Zagreb
Same in Croatia
You're joking, but you don't know just how close you are to the truth
Same here
Bydgoszcz and those two Romanian cities really surprised me as I had no idea they existed
Also I though Murcia wasn't nearly as big
If you're Anglophone, German or Italian, don't. We want to speak *your* language
slavic languages
easy to read once you know the alfabet, however verb aspects and cases will make you wish you weren't born
Start with Serbian, trust me, it is easier
Pro-tip
don't
Agree
We have the exact same 7 cases, kind of surprised it's the same in Latvian
I learned German, it is such an awful language, but a lot of German tourist don't speak English so what can I do
And Serbian is much more easier for Anglophones than Croatian
What inspires you to learn my language
Are you a fanboy of our NT
Was your great-grandpa a Croat
There is a lot of vocabulary differences, We have three main groups of dialects and our linguist tried to incorporate some words from other dialects so standard Croatian has a lot of difficult/unknown words for Serbian speakers
So, if a Serb is speaking Standard Serbian I could understand them much better than they could me
Also, we have some dialects that are more difficult to understand than for example standard Slovenian
And a lot of Croats speaks in various dialects on daily bases which are far from standard form
In Serbia they have much less linguistic diversity
We also made up a lot of words for technical things while Serbian uses a lot of loan words from English, German
I wager you're either 3rd or 4th generation immigrant
It seems that you're very proud of your heritage
You care deeply about your family, and you want to improve your connection with your relatives still living in the  motherland
Getting fluent with the language will definitively help you with that
If it's of any value to you, I met plenty of Germans who spoke very good Croatian (B2 level), so if those Germanic-speaking folks that are notorious for being bad at foreign languages can pull it off, I've no shred of a doubt you can do it too
You come off as a person that's very eager to learn so that's good
The key is to find a person willing enough to be your language parent, as teaching our language to foreigners takes a crap-ton of patience and determination
Language schools are an option -- if you ever relocate to Zagreb you have [this] language school as well as [this one] Both are allegedly pretty good
If you wanna learn it for free though, it's pretty feasible but you're gonna have to go ham with approaching and befriending new people until you find someone willing to teach
Just like Germans, most Croats will gladly wait for you at the finish line and speak to your in their mother tongue once you become very proficient, but won't want to help you get there 'cause they'd rather use you to improve their English
Upping your charisma skill and persistently meeting new people will ensure that you'll find your language sensei
Props on getting your citizenship
It'll come in handy if you ever decide to start a business in Croatia
You are welcome
We could have unity if the other side was cooperative
It was a prelude to WW2

99% of the time
100% of the time in croatian
Although tbh I believe if you develop an ear for a language (and it uses a phonetic alphabet) you can spell almost anything
Every single word
Serbo-Croatian (oh boi why did I write it like that) is 100% phonetically written
Except when it comes to place and people names
We write them like they are or we slavicize
the words while Serbian just phonetically spells them
Example: James(Croatian) Đejms(Serbian)
Thank God, Croatian is phonetically written, so we can always know how to pronounce or write down a word upon hearing it for the first time
My dad knows a bit of English and always complains about its messy pronunciation
Vers vert verre ver
Close to a green glass worm
I think French gets too much flack for this
Aside from accents, it's not that hard to spell
Our professor gave us the rules of spelling French on day one and I seldom ever made mistakes
Po Vuku Karadžiću
There is a small issue with -ije or -je
For an example: A Candle is spelled properly "SvIJEća", but people can make a mistake and spell it "SvJEća" - without the "i". To me personally that us EXTREMELY easy and I can hear the difference and have always spelled those words properly, but many do not
Also, we have slight difference between "č" (hard "ch" sound) and "ć" (soft "ch" sound)
Example: a House - Kuća (correct spelling) or Kuča (wrong spelling)
In slovenian they do not have this problem as they use only "č" and Serbs have clear distinction in the pronounciation between those two, so they make less mistakes
We Croats tend to make more mistakes as we speak softly and our "č" is REALLY close to "ć".
In conclusion, that 1% which has left in his 99% is this what I wrote up here
I wouldn’t say 100% ‘cause of ije/je and č/ć. So 98% :D
Serbian, in other hand, would be 101% (Anđelina Đoli)
Since you have done some research and are from Ukraine can you tell me about Ukranian "ikavian"? How much people use it, is it standard in some areas
Don't know how you say it but Croatian has ikavian dialect
For example standard Croatian word for "milk" woud be "mlijeko", but in ikaviav dialect it would be "mliko" and ekavian is "mleko". Thats the main difference in dialects here (ex-yugo) ije/e/i with lots of other examples
I've read somewhere that only Croatian and Ukranian have that ikavian form of speech
Most of the slavic languages from our perspective would be in ekavian form with just 'e' not 'ije'/'i'.
č/ć are easy if you are not an idiot
They have completely different formations in the mouth (does your tongue go up or down
) . Ije/je are also fairly easy and the only word that is not intuitive to spell is rječnik
It should be ije
Transliterating foreign names into your language (when you have a viable alphabet to spell them as originally) seems to bastardize them for me
I would have to learn a separate spelling of a name for every language I know
Plus I can't imagine reading a book and having to read Čarls or Vilijem or Đon
You need to learn the rules of any language's spelling
You think non-yugos know how to pronounce š, č, ć, đ, ž, lj, nj, dž? C and j? I think this question should apply to languages that have too ambiguous rules or the rules simply don't work in practice as well as they're supposed to
Ok, though we still have this problem where even when someone pronounces it right, students still tend to write it wrong
I have no idea how and why, cause to me that was always the easiest task in the test, but it happens often
No, it is not cause of the cyrillic
We have "dž" (so two characters) for the hard sound of "đ". Also that "đ" can be spelled as "dj", just not in the official use
As it was spelled that way before in our language cause our written characters (sounds) are modeled after written Czech
Though, that would still not fix our issue here as all of us hear differently and people would still mix up those sounds like they do with -ije and -je
Serbuan has the same latin script and they tend NOT to mix up the letters as they put a lot more emphasizes oj the sounds than we do
In most dialects yes
Some places still pronounce č and ć like you, but on the far extreme of the spectrum are some Dalmatian islands which pronounce ć as tj, č as ć, and č as you know it doesn't even exist
You are right with "hlib" that is ikavian version of serbian "hleb", we use "kruh" instead but in "jekavian" form would be "hljeb".
Oh I see and from what you wrote my guess is that ikavian is like standard in Ukraine
You say "hlib" while ekavian would be "hleb" like in other slavic languages
We say "kruh" anyway so no need for dialects here
That's obvious though
Of course I need to learn grammar to use the language properly
The genuine exceptions would be verbs like arreter, jeter, or appeller, wherein you have one of the letters dropping or the accent moving
Yeah, I know what you mean
And right, more pupils
Hahah But students aren't immune to it
(i used students as an example as that is in my age range)
Btw, I always wondered do you guys in Montenegro have similar issue with "š" and "ś" like "č" and "ć?
I get it now
Sometimes it's 'je/ije' sometimes 'i' and sometimes 'e' depending on the word itself
Thx for replies
We kicked je/e it's just "drvo" here hahah
That is quite fascinating actually
I had no idea you guys use soft sounds so much haha
Btw, thanks for the answer
Well it's not official in my country, but when I used to come home from going out during weekends while having drunk too much, I'd say I'm going to pray at the altar
I work in the air traffic control and when we go to take a shit we say "i'm going to give a release for descent".
I've heard a few people say "idem gdje se i najhrabriji useru". Translated: I'm going where even the bravest shit themselves
Otherwise, we call the bowl školjka (seashell), and the room toalet (toilet) or WC
I can only think of Školjka or WC Školjka
Školjka means clam
Same
Well, the name of tbe country and one of the most popular names are enough for start - Hrvatska and Hrvoje
French people just adore these
Is this other thing a table with broken legs
In Zagreb, you call them ‘brate’, which means brother
In Istria, they say fratello/fra too
I am not sure of the other regions
Do you also refer to your parents as "stari/stara"? It's a normal thing here
This sums up pretty well
What was your country's historical moment that was so ridiculous you couldn't believe it when you heard about it
Winning against the Ottomans 4 times and saving Europe cuz of that
*B O I*
That reminds me of a movie ...

What a nice way to say soldiers got hammered
How diverse Croatia is for having such a small land area and population
Thats why saying that croatia is either balkan or central european or mediterranean doesnt make any sense, because its all of those things, depending on the region
Dubrovnik, now best known for being Kings Landing and a popular tourist spot, has very rich and interesting history
Some interesting tidbits include:
&#x200B;
* it was one of the first states to use [quarantene]
* it was one of the first states to [ban slavery in modern times]
* it was one of the first states to [officially recognize the US independence]
5th of may was the battle for castle Itter, the last stand of the Nazi war machine
The war was practically over then, all that was left was to give the coup de grace
Slavic is just a linguistic term, it doesnt imply geography or culture (to some extent, but not exactly)
Same way as finland doesn't really have anything to do with hungary despite the languages being related
EDIT: Answering your question: We are definitely more like the Swiss verision of scouts
We have the regular scouts (Izviđači), which I'm not really familiar with, and they seem like a much smaller organisation, and we have Catholic Scouts (Katolički Skauti)
I myself am still a part of the Catholic Scouts and was since 2013, and it was indeed a pleasure, even though we seem to grow much more inactive as time goes by
My best memories coming from the past decade I could easily thank to scouting
We are a closely connected to the Church and it's what has mostly funded us when we went on bigger trips, and our slogan is "God Church Country 100%" / "Bog Crkva Domovina 100%" (BCD 100%), so it's expected of us to be at least somewhat religious, and the majority of as indeed are
We also say our vows in front of our bishop
In the early years we went on smaller trips in the local countryside every two weeks or so and had quite a good time, but bigger trips were always the shit
We own house near the city of Rijeka given to us by the local bishop some decades earlier and the scouts then renovated it, now  it's a go-to place every summer
We also own a little island some kilometers of the coast of Šibenik where we spend 2 weeks every summer, which i prefer over going to the coastline with my family
Other than that you could expect other "scoutly" activities, so camping, learning to tie knots, spending time in the country side etc
, and also attending many religious happenings in the area since we after all are CATHOLIC Scouts
It is indeed a pity that the organisation seems to be fading away, at least in my area, since it holds a great deal of awesome childhood memories
Same here
The "izviđači" were much much more popular during Yugoslavia and a day rarely goes by without my dear mother telling me how awesome it was
I was not myself a scout in Croatia but I have spent considerable time with them and noticed no boy/girl division
In fact, I believe it would be an insult to them to even propose such a thing
Is that an oddity in European scouting (because judging by comments it is)
I thought the gendered division is exclusively an Anglo thing
Yes, we have quite a bit in Croatia, here are just 2 biggest ones: amphitheater in Pula and Diocletian palace in Split
But some remains can be found in almost every coastal city
Croatia
Arenas like one in Pula, palaces like Diocletian's in Split
My birthtown Vinkovci (Cibalae) was founded by Romans and seems to be the oldest continually habitated town in Europe
We also have the remains of Salona, Narona and other big cities
The Narona museum is one of the best I've ever visited
[zamjenit cu te gorim] by natali dizdar
10+ year old song, but it's still so so pleasing
(croatia)
[This song]
It has a good beat to it and I like listening to it when working/studying
Also not many people (even from croatia) know about it
Heck, even I didn't know it was from croatia until just a few weeks ago
It just doesn't sound like the stuff we usually make
When DotA became a meme I decided to listen to all gis stuff
Was not disappointed
Well we can all agree we like burek
Kranjska kobasica buurek
' I need to trryy thatt
Where can I buy it
Russia does provide Germany with gas
They never leave packages
Smaller are put in the mailbox, but big ones are ither signed and delivered in person or, more often nowadays since deliveries increased by a lot, the post worker brings a slip saying your package is at local post office
People don’t use online delivery enough for packages to be stolen here
Rijeka
Sorry, if I remember correctly from one of earlier similar threads, Slough takes the cake
Cila slavonija
European capital of culture, beautiful (tough it needs renovation) city centre, port area, university, unique topography
Rijeka has some problems, and can look boring from the highway, but once you get into it it's quite interesting city
There are definitely more boring cities or towns in Croatia
Looking at you Slavonski brod, Sisak
i actually really like belgrade except the traffic
i'd go fucking crazy if i lived there
or would end up dead
what really grinds my gears is how many people just decide to park their car in one of the fucking lanes and it's so widespread it's unbelievable
last time i was there a week ago and i've passed infront of a police station where they used the right lane as their private parking
approximately 10 police cars were just parked in the middle of the road, blocking traffic and blocking the right turn lane completely
i lose my shit when i see something like that
Belgrade is pretty big and my family lives in Zarkovo which isnt close to anything so there's no other way
the only one that comes to mind is kukac(bug) where if you turn the second k into an r you get kurac(dick)

jebe - (he/she is fucking) Ona jebe povrće/She's fucking vegetables
kukac - bug
kurac - dick
Here it is basically free, only a small fee of around 40€ is paid at the beginning of the year if you pass all the subjects
Croatia has free universities but idk if they have classes in english
Housing in student homes is also free but you got to have points to get in
Food and drinks
Everytime I travel abroad, to western countries at least, I am absolutely shocked at how expensive your food is
One apple and a bottle of water there could buy me a whole lunch here
Also, public toilets
1€ is waaaay to much
You ought to visit Czech Republic buddy if you think food in serbia is the cheapest
Are you sure about that
I prefer regular rain
But this year we had an occurence  while I was at sea, where it didnt rain but it was thundering
It looked pretty sick you know
Like the purplish pink lighting being pincired by deep dark blue clouds
I wish I couldve taken a picture
It really was
japanke - the japanese (flip flops)
ogledalo - looker (mirror)
Slavs: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
Condescending - snishodljiv
con - with (s-) in French where it originates from
descending - doesn't have a literal translation in its own but we basically took niz "down" and hodljiv "the one who is able to walk" and combined it to mean descending
Ne kontam zadnji
sta znaci vo
Nosorog - in croatian
So, the same as well "Nose Horn".
not likely but they might have the same roots, ogledalo comes from the verb gledati (look) which comes from russian gljadét
Aha, mi kazemo vol
Shvacam, cuo sam "so" prije ali nikad "vo" pa me malo zbunilo

Somehow, I don't think it was unintentional
A) i dont even own or fly a national flag for "our own" holidays
B) i dont own an EU flag nor know anyone who does
And C) i had no idea may 9th is europe day, it is not celebrated in any way so there will be no extra EU flags anywhere
Metastases for Croatia
Aleksi
Družba Pere Kvržice or Vlak u snijegu
Both are children's book movie adaptations but they're both very good
Metastaze
ZG80, Metastaze
Živi i mrtvi, Broj 55
How accurate it is ?
I'd much rather recommend ''Sokol ga nije volio'' or in English, "Sokol did not like him", it shows just how much Croatia was torn between two differing ideologies during 2nd world war, two ideologies that for a simple man living in rural area did not mean nothing, but still took everything from him
Altough you will have a hard time finding English translation for this movie so Metastaze might be good replacement for it, so backstory for metastaze is a life of army veteran with ptsp that is also football hooligan and fairly racist
I didn't like it that much
It really could have been much more
Perhaps I was expecting something different
So all of them

Nagel Eisen
Ill take Merkel just to see what she can do with her famed German discipline
I love that it is an inflected language and that word order is almost meaningless
The subject and predicate can go wherever in the sentence and the meaning will not be lost
In the same vein, I love the lack of articles and not having to think about whether the "the" before "subject" in the above paragraph is sufficient or maybe "predicate" is missing one of its own
In Croatian there just wouldn't be any
How fucked the grammar is
Our swear words
Though, you can expect pretty much any european to say this about their language
Though we're special because we swear at anyhting and everyithing
It's just a good anger language
The urban Zagreb way of speaking (Zagreboi here)
I adore my dialect cause it's a combo of Italian and Croatian, it's hard to understand for other Croatians
Could you give any examples
Pretty please
Exactly, I hate whenever the verb in German is placed in the end of the sentence because the sentence can sometimes be a mile long and you won't be able to connect half of the words before reading the predicate which is u pički materini
In day to day speech most people will follow SVO order which seems to be most natural one, but if you choose to change the order in one sentence you don't have to keep doing that
Order changing is usually used to emphasize something
Of course ordering words completely differently in every sentence would be super weird
Think of it this way, if I say for example: "Grandma killed grandpa" (Baka je ubila djeda), the emphasis is on the killer, but if I put Grandpa first in the sentence then we are finding out the victim
In English you would have to you use passive voice, in Croatian you just say: "Grandpa (was) killed (by) grandma" (Djeda je ubila baka) and it still means the same thing because of grandma being in nominative case which depicts subject and grandpa being in accusative case that says this is the object
Regarding poetry, I think loose word order does help but Croatian has a significantly smaller word count than English for example, so I'd think that represents a limitation as well
Also I'm not very knowledgeable about poetry so please take this with a grain of salt
If I were to guess the meaning purely going by Croatian meaning of the most similar words, it would be: Old woman gives/gifts food to knight bandit
In Croatian: vitez - knight, razbojnik - bandit
Actual meaning of your sentence translated into Croatian would be: Baba daruje hranu hrabrom ratniku
I have to say, I always knew Romanian was super interesting because of the Romance Slavic blend, but seeing it this way, I love it even more
Sorry for the long post, I got really excited
This is super fascinating, I'm dying to see what else can you come up with
[Hladetina]
Basically pork soup with veggies which is cooled down to a temperature in which you can cut it
People put all kinds of things in it, so you can often see chicken legs just kinda poking out of a jelly soup
It truly can and should, go fuck itself
Also, some would say, [fileki or tripice]
Which is a stew made out of animal stomachs
Very controversial, you are either the biggest fan or you hate them
I never met a person under the age of 60 that likes hladetina
I hope it goes to the garbage bin of history
My mom loves tripe
Also, jebes hladetinu koj kurac
I live here and and from SE Europe and fully agree
Also, beans are not breakfast food
Fight me
Isn't ayran just
a type of yoghurt
Maybe we just have bootleg stuff over here so I didn't taste the real deal, idk
People eat frog legs in parts of Croatia too
I tried them once, they're alright
Nothing special really
Are you sure you are not lost balkan tribe
and nepotism, and clientelism
Make your own mead
That's the whole beauty
Me too
I have 7 litres batch with bread yeast
Can you make a good steak
How are your apple pie skills
Honestly I think steaks are overrated
What I like is veal in some goulash, or sauce slowly cooked
Here in croatia beef is everytjing from older cow and it's not that popular
Everyone uses it, and it can be spelled like OK/Ok (most common), okay, okej or oke
Hahahaha oke I like how you added “In Serbia” so the teacher doesn’t notice you copied
Oh shit, where do i even start
WW2 is coming and when the time comes be weary of Ante Pavelic and his Ustase, they'll bring only bad things
Also dont be crazy and form a country with your neighbours, it's not gonna work out well for neither one of you
Oh man
You should sit down, it’s quite a long story
Long story short
Lots of bloodshed
Croatia
>while the soviet occupation wasn't as bad as the nazi occupation, **it came close**
Let's not
Of course the Soviet occupation was terrible for Poland socially and economically
But to say it was **"close"** to the Nazi one that planned a total eradication of Poles as an ethnic group is just dumb
It always saddens me how Dubrovnik is known as "that Game of Thrones city" and not as the historically independent city-state which has:
a) built one of the oldest European pharmacies and [orphanages] and 15
century)
b) [inventor and the home of the first quarantine]
c) one of the first states to [ban the slave trade in modern times]
d) one of the first states to [have officially recognised the US]
As it was incredibly wealthy and art-oriented, Venice considered Dubrovnik as its Adriatic cultural rival
There are still poets and artists that have been born in the region claimed by Italians as theirs
Those are just some interesting facts, I am sure Croatians could continue the list
Dubrovnik used to be a dominant trade and art republic before the Americas were discovered
I believe the whole east of the country is often overlooked with cities like Varaždin and Osijek with rich history and interesting facts
For example Osijek has the first tram in Croatia and the first national Theatre
Also the Zagreb national theatre was inspired by the Osijek one
It also has the first Croatian beer dating from the mid 17th century
Varaždin was the original capital of Croatia and it was replaced because of the big fire there in the late 18th century
Vinkovci are considered by some historians as the oldest town in the world(probably not true but might be) and two Roman emperors were born there
Vinča culture, as Europe's most overlooked ancient civilisation, which had an alphabet and developed machinery way before most others, deserves its own thread
I really wish it gets more prominent and pushes out the whole "Rome and Greece created Europe" narrative out of our textbooks
The word, yes, but the concept originates from Dubrovnik, the Venetians just elongated it from 30 to 40 days

[The quarantena followed the trentino, or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1347 in the Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia)
No single letter names
Iž is (i think) the only two letter
Three is more common
Some weirder threes are Krk or Srđ
We have an island named Iž, but no places with one or two letters
We have a ton of places with three letters, though
Ulm wc when
My favourite three letter names would be places like Sinj, which look like it's four letters, but isn't haha
I guess
In croatian that sound is usually represented by "krc" but i guess this works too
First and last k are pronounced the same
Would that be a peninsula then
I speak italian and the easiest one was spanish followed by french, the others were rather hard (whats up with romanian and all those diacritics
In new Croatian translation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, "Baggins" will be literally translated as "Torbar" (one who makes and/or sells bags)

I feel it's more foreign to me
Well I'm not touched because I'm convinced it's all rebuildable and restorable
I know it will not be the original but many historic buildings are not the same version as they were first built
Now if somebody were to tell me that is not so, then I'd feel devastated
Also I'd feel angry if i were to find out it was not an accident
Last time it happened in 2017
The biggest company in Croatia - Agrokor, became too indebted and couldn't service its debts
To save 50
000 jobs and half of economy connected to Agrokor (biggest retailer in the country, distributor of Croatian agriculture products, food sector etc
) the government decided to introduce a law which took over the company from its owner and gave it to hastily made "comission" to implement whatever necessary to continue with work and find solution with creditors and debtors
Minister of finance used to be highly ranked Agrokor board member
Junior partner demanded that said minister (from senior partner of coalition) should be removed from the government
The PM said no, and live during session of the government all junior party ministers were removed from the session
Everyone expected elections after the [fall of government] but the senior party found enough support among 'independent' MP's, minority MP's and few smaller parties to continue governing alone after winning a vote of confidence in parliament by a one-vote margin
The same senior and junior party already participated in collapse of their own government a year prior to it
[That one] was result of meltdown in coalition that started with an affair about transparency surrounding sale of our national oil company to Hungarian MOL
How can you write about Croatian government collapses and forget about Orešković. I still can't believe we had a Canadian prime minister
Bosnia would like to have a word
You are expected to be proficient in english (since that is the main language for outside communication)
In the coast, italian is also prevalent, while in the inside german takes its place
Tourist workers on the coast can profit much by knowing any (other) language
Of course, this is all for under 30-40 people
Older folk are mostly german/italian with some russian
And no, im not counting serbian/bosnian/montenegrin as separate languages to know ;P
In Croatia you are taught English from kindergarten all the way to last year of high school
Also English is one of 3 obligatory exams you need to pass to finish high school (Croatian (language + literature), Maths and first language which is almost exclusively English
You can also take any number of other exams if anybody's wondering)
In simpler terms English/1st foreign language is 3rd most important subject
Personally I cannot fathom not learning a foreign language in school, it's a norm here
Most high schools also have second foreign language as a subject, depending on part of country it's mostly German or Italian, but can be French as well
So yeah, learning languages is pretty important in Croatia
so no spanish
I somehow expected spanish to be taught in portugal
I find that really weird, since hungarian is so disconnected from any nearby language (pretty much no common words or roots), so expecting people to be able to converse in hungarian seems so strange
I am always astounded when I see a slovene person (usually football players/coaches or singers) speaking more or less perfect croatian with journalists
I don't think I could hold a basic conversation in slovene, even though I live like 30 km from the boder
Depends on part of country
If you're in East or Central Croatia people will most likely know English and German, on ckast English and Italian
Almost everyone knows at least 1 foreign language
if its any consolation, hungarian is also very hard for us non-hungarians
Thats what I mean
If you offered me 4 choices for kosilo, i would have no idea what that means
And somehow slovenes are more fluent in croatian than vice versa
i mostly remember being frustrated not so much with the number of cases, but their specificity and weird ways to translate them in english
Like difference between running behind the house (from elsewhere to there) running behind the house (fully there) or running behind the house (starting there but not ending there)

Also, sligtly connected to that, their movie culture trumps ours I would say any day
**Montenegro** \- Absolute masters of not giving a fuck
Honorary **Macedonia** even though they are not neighbours - food and music
Serbia: Turbofolk reeks of irony, I love it
BiH: Feed me more čevapi
Montenegro: Thank you for creating Euro Neuro and Balkan Boj
Hungary: die (I feel like I have to put an obvious disclaimer that this is a joke given our history together
You can't have Croatia without Hungary and the other way around, otherwise thank you for teaching my mom to put black beer into goulash it is very tasty)
Slovenia: Gorenje (Fuck Iskra I have an Iskra toaster that shit broke in like 2 months you can suck my dick Iskra fuck you Iskra god I hate Iskra)
Chill
I always thought we have 0 chill as stubborn, hot-headed Balkaners
Too true
It's our cat nip
You open a bag of Vegeta and we all come running
As someone who worked in a store I'll say it's very stupid of costumers to assume that I, the person who just puts things on the shelves has personally tasted all the wines and champagnes and can give you an expert opinion on which to buy
Funilly enough, the Czecch republic will always remain my favourite for exactly the same reason - the people
They seemed to have the work ethic/organization of a western European country, but Slavic chillness and friendlieness
Absolutely perfect combo
Yeah when you work in a store that sells those kinds of things exclusively you should get a basic training on it
But I was working in a regular supermarket and idk expecting me to know everything about everything that's being sold there is kinda dumb
Really
I who's official job description was warehouse worker should know every single thing about every item being sold in a giant store, rather than you simply educating yourself on what you want to buy
Please
Besides supermarkets are self service stores
You doing it all on your own is the entire point
Croatia will take him
We can give you any right winger you choose
He's a man of practicality
Pretty much no
Its likely someone at the city office where you register your child would talk to you if you wanted to use some inappropriate name, but AFAIK, you could name your child anything
Couple of years ago, someone naimed their son Diego Armando Maradona + last name
Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia is very popular among tourists
It is something different compared to traditional museums
Uffizi is surreal
The whole Florence is surreal
My advice: if you ever visit, get the Florence Card and visit as much museums as you can
I really liked the Beer Museum and the LEGO Museum in Prague
Something different and unique
I always try to learn at least how to say “Hello, do you speak English
” in the local language when I travel somewhere
I think it’s common courtesy to at least greet in the local language
I really don’t mind if a foreigner just says hello in my language and even if they do only that, I’ll know by pronounciation they’re not native Croatian speakers
I visited Do once and can confirm that "anyone who tries speaking Danish needs all available encouragement" is definitely a mood
i think the post was more about tourists that come to russia or people learning russian that try their best to speak russian and make a lot of mistakes not the people who can only say "нет сука, да водка" or some shit
I was, multiple times but I wasn't salty about it as everything else was 10/10 in terms of hospitality so it was easily forgiven (this is a massive compliment when it comes from a Balkanese)
Although I am from the continent, I very strongly associate that salty air smell you get from the sea with Croatia
Add to that some rakija maybe and a slowly cooked stew/sauce like pasticada dish and you'd get the Croatia smell
In 1991 Croatia had 4
784
265 people that lived here
In mid-2018 it had 4
087
843 people living here
The number of people that live outside Croatia is almost the same as the number of people that live inside Croatia and growing
It doesn't feel really good
A lot of my friends have left for Germany, Ireland or America
Most of my family (from my fathers side) live in Germany or America
We have also found out that my grandma's niece (I think) that lives in Germany has Covid-19 along with her pregnant daughter
She has cried a lot but has not been able to see her, just talk to her, from thousands of kilometers away
Losing friends, losing family
All in all it doesn't feel really good
Well here the first grade is like you and about 25-30 classmates and then the eighth grade is like you and 13-18 classmates
The population of Croatia in 1990 was around 4
7 million
The population now is around 4 million, more likely to be 3
9 than 4
I was born and live in the country's capital Zagreb which hasn't really experienced a decrease of population but rather a small slow growth
But even so  , I have recently started noticing that there is really a lot of old people around
I go for a walk and realize that the most of the people at the central square are older people
Now, if I notice this in the capital and the largest city (around 800 000 people) then you can just imagine how it looks in smaller towns or villages
It really is horrible
Also, of course, this has a really bad impact on the economy
Apart from the real pensioners there is I think around 500 000 of people that get their pension because they were in the war
If you look up the details, at its peak the Croatian military had around 90 000 active personnel so the 500 000 people is really inflated
This happens because the only condition for getting a pension like that is to have two eye witnesses, you can see how this might work
And even with 700 000 people less than 30 years ago Croatia still has 145 000 of unemployed people which is going to get a lot worse this year because tourism forms around  40% of our economy
I could keep going about the corruption but it is all just sad really
Unfortunately not anymore
These days in Croatia, young people and whole young families are moving away
Even people with steady income jobs move away simply because of salary/work conditions
For example, lots of nurses and medicinal doctors leave for Germany or UK because their starting salary there is way higher than here (even adjusted to standard of living) with better working conditions
So we are now losing people left and right
In places where it has been legalised it has lowered crime rates, so I'm all for it
Also it has a lot of medical uses
I used to belive the entirety of Yugoslavia was only in Croatia's modern borders
Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, BaH, Montenegro and Macedonia all in Croatia
I first encountered Prussia in an Extra History series
I confronted my history teacher like "Yo what's this Prussia thing and what's their deal". We hadn't gotten to Prussia yet at that point,
Barcelona - Edinburgh - Vienna - Dubrovnik - Valletta
Ummm less touristic and Dubrovnik can’t really go in the same sentence
it’s like the tourist town of Croatia heh
Still a great place to visit tho
Yeah Dubrovnik is a lot smaller so tourists basically overrun the place, especially in July/August
They finally started to try and limit cruisers allowed in the port so that should help in the future, as well the people allowed in the main centre so that you can actually enjoy the visit and not just be annoyed at the crowds
> small mistakes in a foreign language cause 3 kids
When you miss the first class where numbers are taught
I wish I could just forget what happened to my family in the 90s, if only
I feel for both girls
But props to you for being so polite and open to knowing about it
: )
I found it funny when my native speaking Slovak teacher who was learning Croatian didn't know how NOT to devoice the final consonant
Thus 'trg' (town square) sounded like 'trk' (running)
But a well known warning to Croats travelling to Czech Republic is not to adress women/girls as 'cura' (girl, girlfriend in Croatian) as it's very similar to 'coura' (whore in Czech)
Hahahahahah I also had no idea that "trudna" is tired in slovenian, until now
Damn
"i" means "and", "nj" (nj is one letter) means "(for) her", "o" means "about" and in some cases can mean "by", "u" means "in", "k" means "to" and we also have "a" which is a form of "and" and my dialect also has "z" which means "from"
In Croatian:
s=with
k=towards
u=in
a=but(not exactly, but really close)
i=and
o=about
That's all we got :)
Very similar
Although i is just and and a is just also
u is in instead of v (unless you're kajkavian), from is iz so not a one letter word, o is the same near is not a one letter word here
Nj je isto dijalekt, mislim da nije u standardnom hrvatskom
stilski obiljezena rijec, ne koristi se vise u govornom jeziku no jos je uvijek dio standardnog hrvatskog jezika
Dobro onda, I have been outsmarted
Ugodnu vecer ti zelim
eh i ja sam mislio da je dio dijalekta, profesorica iz hr nas sada muci s time pa moramo znat
laka ti noc
In Croatia, at least where I live, it is seen as showing of
People generally, if they know where and for who you work, can assume how much you earn
If you work for the government, on any level, your salary info is publicly available if you know where to look
Since we grow olives here the split is almost 50-50
It leans slightly more toward green olives but barely from what I see
Reading this makes me want to work at ESA even more
Though of course it falls into the usual European pitfall of not explaining itself very well
Well, I still have a looong way
I am now entering my last year of primary school (8th grade) And I will make sure my back is therally broken from work
Yes, children from very young age walk alone to school (8-9 years old)
Or take the bus if school is not in walkable distance
Also, a lot of times children live close by so they go to school together
And they also play outside without parents watching over them
In my 27 years I dont remember one single incident and I live in the capital, in "big" city like you said
Yes, in first semester of first grade, maybe the entire first year depending how close to the school they live, they get escorted by parent, but then you're on your own
And school buses aren't really a thing in cities (they exist only in more wide spread, rural areas)
They tend to use double negative and often leave out a/an
Same in croatian - aktualno
Never heard anyone mixing that though, I just hear people throwing in the word in English into a Croatian sentence, like "frajer je to actually napravio" (which still technically doesn't 100% fit, they basically replace zapravo with stvarno)
There is one other word that I personally mix that I can't remember right now, damn it
Edit: saw a comment below, it's eventually and eventualno
Visited Vienna with a few friends, came to our hotel
Turns out the receptionist is a Croat
Nice, I think
We walk into the lift with two guys from hotel maintenance
Turns out one of them is Bosniak when he heard us speak
2 hours later at dinner, waiter overhears us talking, says hello, asks how things are going, what brings us here
In Serbian
Goddamn Yugos everywhere
Yup pretty much what I've found over the years
Also construction, but that's more of a stereotype about Gastarbeiter in Germany
Yes, Croatia does issue ID cards which are compulsory after the age of 18, but it is possible to get them earlier
[Front side]
[Back side]
Ngl I hate the design
Yeah, like confirming your identity with mail with your name on or your bank card
So weird
Here, you have to have it on your person at all times as police can stop to "legitimize" you at any moment and not being able to provide an identification is a punishable offense
I mean if you're just waking your dog or going to the shop no one is going to bother you but at larger gatherings it's a must
Hmm, yours are kinda similar to ours
Polish ID's also have parents' names IIRC
Seeing other countries IDs ours (Croatian) is pretty good looking and readable
It's madatory to make an ID at 16 years of age and have some form of formal identification with you at all times
Also our ID serves as a passport for every other EU memeber, EEA members, Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo
Sterted im kindergarten when I was 3
English being present everywhere and having such simple grammar made it really easy to learn
Started learning when I was 6, by the time I was 12 I could fully understand and decently speak, around 13-14 I would say I became fluent, and then when I was 15 I was at the point where I spoke more English than Croatian (my native language)
I learned mostly just by watching an absurd amount of videos, and school only helped me with maybe grammar (tenses, word forms, etc)
School for theory
Books, TV and games for vocabulary
It helps that I read a lot, and waiting to get most books in translated edition is ... terrible
started learning at around 4 at home because my family knew it would be useful, I learned to read early and my grandmother used to be an English teacher
However I only started rapidly improving after I started using internet at around 12/13
I just watched a lot of english channels on TV like Cartoon Network, Boomerang, Nickelodeon(spongebob mostly) and youtube when I first discovered it
Now I am almost 15 and my english is almost on the C-1 level but I still got new words to learn and I need experience and my mom teaches english and german in high school so that helped too
Improved by reading, watching movies, reddit and videogames
I went on an youth exchange under the Erasmus+ programme in Sarikamis, Turkey
It isn't exactly strange but it was exotic so to say
oh man, i'd say i'm pretty good at it, being from a tourist popular place in croatia
i don't mean to offend anyone but the stereotypes are kinda true, most of the time, that is
Just to name few:
**Germans**: if old then they can be seen on a beach, always (and i mean always) on a chair or something like that, under an umbrella, very red and sun burnt
if they're fat AND tattooed then they're germans for sure
wearing birknestocks since before they were cool (and one of the reasons i still refuse to wear anything similar to it, it reminds me of old germans)
if young then driving a golf 5 and listening to loud music
usually having fun and coming in groups of 5 to 10 people
i always had fun while hanging with germans
**Italians**: usually very very loud
men wear shorts that definitely couldn't fit them since the elementary school
they like playing sports, usually decent in football but terrible in basketball
but what they lack in technique they compensate with heart and stamina
i mean they're all over the place, hard to keep up
**Czech/Slovak**: usually in families of 4, they like to rent a small boat and act as a captain for the duration of their stay, like to go around on small islands rather than staying on a single place
the running joke in croatia is about czech people getting lost on a mountain in flip flops and/or at sea on an air mattress
because that happened
more than few times
i'll just say that they're adventurous
**Slovenes**: they're in a camper or on a bike
Also adventurous but a bit smarter and more prepared than the former
if you see someone who looks like he took a wrong turn from giro d'italia it's probably a slovene, either with a car with 5 bikes on it or on a bike in full race gear
**English**: if not a festival season then usually completely red, ginger hair and burnt to a crisp
usually polite (i know people complain about them but tbh, i never had any problems with them) but sticking to themselves (as opposed to germans who want to hang out with anyone)
if festival season then stumbling around the town half naked or dressed like from that tv show [the tribe] around 6 in the morning or puffing those little bottles on the sidewalk
really friendly while they're still half conscious but that must be the drugs
**Serbian**: usually come in groups of 2 families or solo if they have a family member living in the area
they can be seen in a beach bar, loudly talking and drinking
the poorest of the bunch but by far the most generous
**The Dutch**: haven't seen them much, they're usually hanging out on campsites with slovenes, driving audi station wagons with bikes on top of it
EDIT: oh also i'd like to add that if i go to another country, i can always tell when someone's croatian (or serbian or bosnian)
i can't explain how, it's just you see that person or a group and it's like they don't belong there
we pop out like popcorn
the further the better, of course
aw man
thats so nice
Why not soy and tofu
"Maćij kašalj" translates to "A cats cough" means "A piece of cake"
We do
It is called [Institut za hrvatski jezik i jezikoslovlje]
The Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics is the central national scientific institution for the research of the Croatian language and general linguistics
We also have [Matica hrvatska]
Matica hrvatska was founded in 1842 with the purpose of promoting national and cultural identity in the fields of artistic, scientific and spiritual creativity, economy and public life, and care for social development
It is one of the largest and most important publishers of books and magazines in Croatia
Though this one is much more than just lamguage, it includes it in its "mission".
Serbs definitely have their own institute
As far as I know, they do not cooperate that much
Since the languages may be similar but, the rules of writing are pretty different
Just to note here, in the past the languages were much more diverse than today
It is not the other way around
They came closer over the years
The example is the so called bosnian language where they use **everything**. They accept all the rules from both serbian and croatian
They accept both vocabularies and both accents
So in a nutshell, bosnian is what yugoslavian laguages was aimed to be
They managed to create it, just not in every country
[The only cooperation between the two] I could find after 1850
This shows how eager they were to create one language out of it
Forcing such agenda has caused issues afterwards
Edit: Also [this] I have just found this and think it is an interesting read
You could do a bit of research on this topic as it is fascinating one (at least to me) and it shows how much politics plays a role in everyday life
You be the judge of what you read and find
Good luck hahah
Well, overall they do fall into the same category
Just like Czech and Slovak, or to an extent like Danish and Norwegian
To me, as a native, they sound different and you definitely know where does someone come from when they start to speak
I hear the biggest difference in the accent (serbian being much stronger and harsher, at least to my ear), vocabulary (nouns tend to be different and the names for things, places and people), suffisex (exmp
: kontroli*sati* and kontroli*rati*) and lastly usage of "-e" (in serbian) and "-ije, -je, -i" (in croatian)
For an example:
- **pretty/nice** > l*e*po (serbian) - l*ije*po (croatian)
- **time/weather** > vr*e*me (serbian) - vr*ije*me (croatian
... and so on
Those are the basics, pretty much
In a nutshell, as much as they are same or similar, we cannot hide where do we come from when we start to speak
Everyone hears those differences I wrote here
That is the best I can explain haha
Or ~~Piran~~ *
For artists that are still alive and popular, I would recommend Gibonni
There is this man who died months ago, he's from south of Croatia and every Croat knows about him, but i would like everyone to know what a good singer that guy was
Here is the link to one of his songs
Well, I just answered that question in another thread, so I'll just paste it here
I don't really listen to metal, but I think there are some great rock bands in Croatia that are kinda big here but not really internationally
I'll list them here with links to the song i like the most of them
[Aerodrom - Digni me visoko]
[Azra - Lijepe žene prolaze kroz grad ]
[Kojoti - Trese, lupa, udara]
[ITD BAND - Elena]
[Atomsko Sklonište - Pomorac sam majko]
[Neki to vole vruće - California]
[Film - Sjećam se prvog poljupca]
[Bajaga - Dvadeseti Vek]
[Neno Belan / Đavoli - Stojin na kantunu]
[Parni Valjak - U prolazu]
[BOA - Svi tvoji poljupci]
[Bijelo Dugme - Ako ima Boga]
[Jinx - Smijem se ]
[Električni Orgazam - Igra rokenrol cela Jugoslavija]
[Kerber - Hajde da se volimo ]
[Prljavo Kazalište - Kiše jesenje]
Yes, I know there are some Serbian artists as well on this list, but this seemed like a great chance to introduce some people to rock'n'roll music from my and neighbouring countries as well
Enjoy
It was extremely popular in Croatia as well (for rock listeners), the original Hungarian version
Zagreb- Split
That thing is another level
Cars with ZG plates when derby is being played end up damaged
Same goes for ST cars around Makismir venue in Zagreb
Just google Bad Blue Boys- Torcida rivarly but it's mostly capital city vs second biggest city in a country
Can you explain term *vesničan*?
My sick mind tells me that term comes from Vesna, slavic goddess so you are calling them backwards villagers
I'm probably wrong
Agree
Its coast vs inland, "lazy appartment owners who get their money from tourists during three months in summer" vs "hard working continentals", sea vs skiing, italy vs germany
I was waiting for someone to mention it
True, we were just jealous at them, now we earn as much as them in 2 months time while advent is active
Thanks for an explaination
he didn't say unification with whom
Yes
Let's take Shrek for example
In the Croatian dubbed version, Shrek has a Dalmatian accent, Donkey has a Northern/Zagreb accent and uses a lot of slang words, Fiona and her parents speak the perfect standard Croatian language, while sometimes Fiona uses a few words that are frequent in Zagreb
It's basically like this: strong accent in the original - Dalmatian dubbed/ "cool" or "teenlike" - Zagreb/ fancy - standard Croatian with the perfect pronunciation
The Dalmatian accent is used with characters that inhabit or are close to the sea or another body of water (for example in Finding Nemo or Spongebob; the fish and sea creatures have a Dalmatian accent)
Sometimes the Zagorski accent as well, which works better for a farmer/hillbilly type of character
Zagreb pronunciation is definitely not "perfect standard" Croatian
The "Purger" accent has really bad intonation as opposed to standard Croatian
But I agree on the rest
Also, the accent from Zagorje is often used with village folk/hillbilly types of characters, like Tow Matter from Cars
I didn't say Zagreb pronunciation was perfect, I said the *standard* Croatian language was used for the perfect pronunciation
Donkey's pronunciation is far from perfect, even in the original movie
Edit: I rewrote the first comment, so there aren't any confusions
That's true, it does
Thanks to Venecian colonists, the Dalmatian people have picked up an Italian-sounding pronounciation and quite a bit of italian-derivative words
Ah, my mistake, I have the attention span of a fruit fly
Same, I get that haha
Yes, sometimes people don't even understand each other
We hava a lot of diversity in Kajkavian dialect
But a lot of it is dead because of Yugoslavia
They are called "cases" in english
To ti i govorim
Zašto pisati "padeži" ako postoji engleska riječ za to ("cases"), te ako pišeš na engleskom, piši do kraja na engleskom
Sve pet
I don't think any human being with a brain is blaming Poland for extermination camps, people are much more likely saying the death camps were in poland, not that the Polish controlled them
Its general knowledge that the Poles didn't control the Jewish death camps, and when you say "Polish death camps" you know people are talking about Nazi death camps located in Poland, this is general knowledge
Saying "Polish death camps" should be perfectly clear to anyone above the age of 12 that it wasn't the Polish in control of those camps
I never said people are born with this knowledge but almost every human on earth knows this
Tehnička kultura - Technical education
It's a mandatory subject throughout the last 4 years of primary school
We basically learn how to draw blueprints, how to work with breadboards etc
In Croatia we do have 'religious education' but it is strictly Catholic and curriculum is mandated by the Vatican
in my opinion it is completely unconstitutional, no matter that it is not mandatory subject, it clashes with the idea of separation of state and church
In elementary school, there's'  no alternative to it but in high school, you must choose between something called Ethics and 'Religious education'
problem is that idea of reevaluating Religious education purpose in state-run schools is support almost taboo topic between both left and right party
Right-wing of course wholeheartedly support the thing but the left is too cowardly to make even lukewarm stance on it, tricky thing is then they should bring in the question of Vatican contracts under which R.E. is enforced in public schools, and much more and that is a whole big can of worms that again undermine constitution IMO and even sovereignty of Croatia as a country
How far the church has the reach in Croatia is fact that sex ed even euphemism as health education is still not subject in most of the schools
why, because it doesnt condemn homosexuality and propagate gender ideology or something
big NoNo for god-fearing people of Catholic Republic of Croatia
Sorry I just read the title of the post, saw Religion education and started ranting
The same is in Croatia
Gymnasiums have Latin as mandatory, and "classical" gymnasiums have ancient Greek as well
Plus the other two foreign languages (English  + another one) that are mandatory
Mostly grammar I'd say, but I really don't know
We have 8 years of primary school, and then 4 of high school where you choose between a gymnasium and a vocational school (some vocational schools for example like the ones for hairdressers and automehnaics last 3 years)
After that you have the Matura exam (only for gymnasiums and vocational schools that students attended in duration of 4 years
) Your Matura exam determines if you enroll at a uni or not
You have two levels, A and B, (high and basic level)
You don't have a name on your paper but a number so everything is fair and the teacher that corrects it (always from a different school) doesn't know who you are
Croatian, maths and a foreign language are mandatory, and you can choose other subjects depending on the faculty that you're applying for and what it wants
Slavonski Brod (Croatia) and Brod (B&H)
They are seperated by river Sava
Here in Croatia we have the town of Slavonski Brod on the river Sava
On the other side of the river, in Bosnia and Herzegovina lies the Bosanski Brod
In Yugoslavia this was a single town which had around 90 000 inhabitants, a bridge still exists but it is just a border crossing
There are a lot of problems there because Bosnia has an old oil refinery on their side that is polluting a lot but the people of Slavonski Brod can't do much about it because the refinery is in an other state
Stara Gradiška (Croatia) and Gradiška (Bosnia), Hrvatska Kostajnica (Croatia) and Kostajnica (Bosnia), Hrvatska Dubica (Croatia) and Kozarska Dubica (Bosnia)
and many more hahaha
Yup
I just mentioned these two as a most famous example
Yeah, it is the biggest one that is split if I am not mistaken
I just wanted to add some more to the list
Edit: interestingly enough, all of them are split with Bosnia and on the rivers Sava and Una
Hmmm
Croatian history and Serbian history from 1940-1995 are 2 differerent stories with no similarities
Well I think for us it is obvious
1991-1995
The world calls it "Yugoslav wars", we call it "Patriotic War",l and "Independace War". Also we do not agree with the Serbs as they say they were the victims and were chased out of their homes, and we say they raised a rebellion, slaughter their neighbours and friends and cut off one part of the country from the rest and occupied it for 5 years
You can see how this can be a point of different believes and views
*(Not aimed to offend anyone)*
He's viewed as bringing modern infrastructure and liberty to Croatia so we kinda adore him
Well you could also add to that the King of Yugoslavia's dictatorship
Serbs see it as he was merely trying to keep the country together and was doing his best to just repel the opposition and rebellion
But, Croatia views it as border totalitarism and a way to supress other nations who are not Serbs (Slovenes, Croats and Bosniaks)
Even before that
All the way from 1918 up to 1999
Though even today there is the question of Kosovo
Is it a country
Is it not a country
Yes, that is correct
You don't have to think anymore, now you know it is true
Kind of and kind of not cause he took the Ragusa Republic down
So, he us not adored, but not hated either
We see the benefits he brought with him
Slovaks and Czechs understand eachother as well
However the argument may be for the languages, imo it is for the best we keep them seperated as they have been and still are developing under different circumstances
Those who rebelled were in fact "the bad guys". Almost in every sense of the word
Indeed, Orthodox Croatians
They like to call themselves "Serbs" (whatever that may be) for some reason unknown to the universe
Wait there are people that don't have home clothes
Oh my god don't even get me started
Cavoglave - patriotic song from Croatian homeland war with Serbia
We sing it very often, and Serbs dont like it
Some of the lyrics:
-Listen you, band of serbian volunteer guerillas,
Our revenge will get you even in Serbia
-Fire your Tompson, Kalashnikov and Zbrojovka
Throw grenade, chase the gang trough the spring
Jasenovac i Gradiška stara
Tbh there is more, I would say communist songs might piss off the right wing quite easily, as much as some war-related songs (Cavoglave most notably) would trigger the left
I don't hear anyone sane in Croatia singing it
Yes that would be the guy
Bojna Čavoglave
Well I mostly play Hoi4 and never vanilla
So I play whatever I feel like
But as for the country with which I've had the most fun
Hands down *unsavoury* Germany in UMC
Appatently it's Gornje Mrzlo Polje Mrežničko, which means Upper Cold Mrežnica Field
Mrežnica's a river in central Croatia
It took me about an hour to learn how to pronounce it semi-fluently, and now I'm just waiting for an opportunity to flex on everyone with it
And of course, yearly competitions to see who can perfectly pronounce it
And the jury are native Welshmen
Pecs Hungary or Sombor Serbia not really sure where to go first
Btw Sombor has great food and cheap shoes and Pecs is just beatiful itself
Monaco
Very pretty but I’d imagine it’d get boring quite fast
We were only there for a few hours though
lmao, I felt the same when I was there
Alaska, I would've said russia or ukraine but I see them quite often
Can't remember if it was Bahrein or Qatar, saw it on highway a couple of months ago when driving home after work
Struck me as something you don't see that often in these parts
I've seen a couple of American license plates (New Jersey, Massachusetts and California), Canadian one (Ontario) and an Icelandic one
We say "at" (but pronounce it like et) and "monkey" (manki)
Its monkey (not even translated)
I dont think we have "native language" name
If you are giving your adress you either say at or monkey
"Monkey" used to be more popular before, now "at" is used
We also say monkey or "at"
Yeah, we also say either “monkey” or “at” in Croatia
Usually for the underdog
In any other case: ex-YU countries, Poland or Ireland
I don't  watch football religiously
Only time I did was World Cup 2018
Croatia
Either Serbia, Bosnia, Slovenia
Ireland (great buncha lads)
Italy
Germany, Poland or Ireland
Croatia
Ex-Yu countries, Ex-AH countries, rest of Balkan countries, Germany, Poland, Ireland
Rest of slavic countries
Rest of Europe
South American countries, Japan, Korea
Rest of the world
You are welcome
Aww, warms my heart
I love you too
Ireland, great bunch of lads
That's our brat
aww <3
Can I just ask you from a greek viewpoint: which countries do you consider Southern/Mediterranean European countries
Poor countries tend to have population growth
Working hours in France
In Croatia, I am used to pretty much everything being open from 8 to 20 on week days, with shops and stores working entire saturdays and even sundays for most of the time
Then I went to France (Orleans and nearby area) for a year and had to take a day off every time i needed to go to the bank or post office because their hours matched mine perfectly
My lunch break was theirs as well, and when my working hours ended so did theirs
I have no idea how and when people do administrative stuff without needing to miss work
Most bars closed before 20 on work days and 22 on weekends
Supermarkets had "now open 'til noon on saturday" banners, and pretty much nothing worked on sundays
I remember walking through the city centre with friends (from my country) one sunday around six pm, it was summer, sun was still high, and we were complaining how we couldnt do anything since stores were closed, caffes were closed, patiseries were closed, even public transport sucked
How much rice Portuguese people eat, compared to us Croatians
> small rural town of 80,000 people
We have different perspectives of what "small" and "rural" means
U from san marino
big fan of ur football national team me and my cousins always cheer like u won world cup when u score goal or when match is draw and thats how i feel about micronations
1 question why do you have so much airaoft guns in san marino
Croatia always has a soft spot for San Marino since the guy who made your country comes from one of our islands
Vatican we love because we are heavy catholic boys
For Luxembourg, my aunt works there but idk about other opinions
Liechtenstein is pretty neutral with us along with Andorra, Monaco has some of our sportsmen living there and Liberland is a joke, it doesn't exist
Madness
I honestly think that if they still had conscription and the general population had to send their children in the army overseas American top brass wouldn't dare to do half of the shit they feel comfortable doing these days
I mean what the fuck was this
Droning of a general and important political figurehead of a regional power and rival of an ally who is at the time in another country under diplomatic immunity
That's some Cold war bullshit, but nowadays they don't even care for pretense to use for example a proxy and the president of the United States gloats publicly on social media
They won't attack the US, but everyone will feel their response in a way
Closing the Strait of Hormuz looks like a logical answer and it would cause the price of fuel to skyrocket
The other thing to think about is that the killed general was funding, arming and coordinating shia militias not only in the ME but also on the Arab Peninsula, and that we can expect a lot of attacks in the region in the future
This attack also increases the instability in Iraq that is already close to another civil war
I'm afraid Europe could see a new refugee wave soon, and this time with even more people, and less cooperation from Turkey and NA countries that were Europes buffer zone for decades without us really noticing it
Ser-
Serbia
Serbia probably
Serbia
Nahhh we're pretty chill about you, you won't get Piranski tho
but where would we go skiing when the winter comes
Arriving ?
too casual
We do
The type of meal is called "gablec". Usually costs 25-35 kuna (3-5€) and it's something you can eat fast and get back to work with a full stomach
More often than not you eat it with a spoon
Students have their cafeterias, in which the food might not traditional (or edible sometimes), but it can get your stomach full for 0
8€. (soup, main meal, salad, desert)
Yeah we have something like that, but we dont have name for that kind of places
We call the meals ''gablec'' if you are from mainland or ''marenda'' if you are on the coast
Its usually cheap traditional food like 5 € for stews or some meat with potatoes, or fish and black risotto if on the coast
And you get little salad and some bread with it
Really depends on the place
What about Grinzing in Vienna
Isnt that basically the same
Homemade food in someone's home, at least a while back when i visited it
It was christmas, in 2000
I was 15 back then tho and i went with my parents so i dont know the prices
I never went back there anymore
I will go "Nocturno" by Oliver Dragojevic, a really dear song to me, its really sad too
[One and only ]
Dino Dvornik-Afrika
Oliver Dragojević-Trag u Beskraju, Cesarica
Gibonni-Libar
Azra-Balkan
Bijelo Dugme-Đurđevdan, Lipe Cvatu
Prljavo Kazalište- Marina, Heroj Ulice
Time-Time album is great
Gibonni if you want some good production
And this is not Croatian, but listen to this album:
Idoli- Odbrana i Poslednji Dani
And this artists:
Ekatarina Velika
S.A.R.S.
Bijelo Dugme
Not Serbian, but [this] is catchy as fuck
In my opinion  U boj U boj by Ivan Zajc (iirc)
Its a great song and I think it should be our anthem
dobra
Can you give me a link
I can't seem to find a video
I don't know
And I haven't read the books in Croatian, only English
>Were the movies dubbed in Croatian
Nope
We call it šalabahter, sometimes shortened to šalić. Apparently the word comes from the German word Scharteke, and that word comes from the French word charte
That could be true and my info could be wrong
When I googled etymology of the word šalabahter, šalabakter was written in parentheses next to it
So who knows
Unless something major changed in the last decade, no
Aside from (unlabeled) pegs for coats in some classrooms, nothing in both primary and secondary education
No lockers are really rare actually but last year lockers were brought for the 1st to 4th grade but not the others
We also took our shoes off throughout entire primary and secondary school
Though, we needed to have slippers or any other form of footwear to wear during the day at achool and would leave our shoes in a shoe rack and hang our coats above them
Those racks and hangs were always places just outside of a classroom and each grade had their own row assigned to them for that year
In High School we could wear the shoes inside and coats as well, though we did have a changing room where we could hang our coats if we wanted to
Other than that
nothing more
No lockers
Had to carry our books for that day (had a schedule) and bring them back home with us as well
Aslo we bring our notebooks with us at all times
If you didn't have your notebook for that specific subject you had that day, you would get a minus
3 minuses and you get an F (1 in croatian, cause grading system is 1-5)
Our hallways looked like [this] in High School
Also no lockers
The photos on the walls are from the previous generations that finished the same HS
Each class section (A, B, C, D and sometimes E) got one photo with all of their portraits and names under
Each class section has around 30 students at the beginning of the 1st HS grade (so 9th grade in German and English system)
At the end it always falls down to 20-25
Haha
We didn't leave our books at school
We had all of them at home and had a schedule for that day of which subjects we had (7-8 subjects per day) and carried books and notebooks for them that day to school
Then aftewards we would bring all that back home and switch them for the ones for tomorrow and put those in our backpack
In croatian:
Million = milijun
Billion = milijard
Trillion = trilijun
Quadrillion = kvadrilijun
Quintillion = kvintilijun
Croatian:
* 10^6   -> Milijun
* 10^9   -> Milijarda
* 10^12 -> Bilijun
* 10^15 -> Bilijarda
And it goes on with the same sufixes (Trili-, Kvadrili- etc
Like this:
-  -
︎ milijun (10^6 ) = million
︎milijarda (10^9 ) = billion
︎bilijun (10^12 ) = trillion
︎bilijarda (10^15 ) = Quadrillion
︎trilijun (10^18 ) = Quintillion
︎trilijarda (10^21 ) = Sextillion
︎kvadrilijun (10^24 ) = Septillion
︎kvadrilijarda (10^27 ) = Octillion
︎kvintilijun (10^30 ) - Nonillion
Yes
Zagreb has [it
] They even decorate the [tunnels ] for Christmas every year
It's quite beautiful
You can visit it legally at working hours
Otherwise it is closed after 10 I think, so it wouldn't get vandalized at night
Adriatic sea(sorry Italy, it is more beautiful on our side)
Red and white squares
Ive heard that our anthem is one of the most peaceful ones
It doesnt mention any kind of supremacy or greatness, just natural beauty
Our ability to sports
Iirc the Serbian football team coach said: "Why can't you play like the Croats
Not really
The only people I’ve seen do that are small kids
Croatia because I am biased, it makes no sense and looks like a dragon (from two perspectives)
Otherwise I like Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Iceland and Wyoming
Croatian borders kinda look like a bird stretching it's wings and I love it
This seems like something I would find in a Geography now video
I had a Bulgarian friend say to me that we should own Bosnia because the border fits so frustratingly well
It does, but we all know what disaster that would be
No, rectangle, perfectly balanced Wyoming
Why Wyoming over any other rectangle state, idk
Yes, I can tell apart North american accents from rest of the accents
To clarify I can tell if it's english, scottish, irish
Northern english sometimes sounding like scottish
I have a hard time separating South african from english or australian
I always think what part of british isles is that
On the other side I can't tell apart canadian from american unless american speaks southern accent or I hear that canadian deep accent in a word *about*
Definitely
Also, I understand Slav English better than native speakers
My guess is we sometimes do very specific grammar errors when constructing sentences, which make sense if you translate them to one of the Slav languages but on English sound like incoherent mess
I'm sure it's a thing for a lot of people, but I personally never met a non native that spoke English like a native
I've heard of this before, but can you give a video/audio example or something
And a written explanation lol
The only phrase with biting I heard here is "zagrist govno", "to bite the shit", but that one doesn't have anything to do with dying, it's used more in the sense of "suck it up and do something unpleasant".
The most commonly used slang phrases I heard about dying are "otegnuti papke", "to spread the hooves", or "odapeti", "to let loose (e.g. an arrow)"
We don't use it in a dying scenario, but in my area people often say "zagristi govno" (to bite the shit) when we have to swallow our pride and do something we are not proud of
Our history, position and unique balkan culture is something noone else in the world has
Hundreds of occupiers since the end of our kingdom in 1102, catholic church in the balkans and our general shape is weird and hard to manage with flat lands in the east, mountains in the middle and coastline in the west on such a weird and small Territory with diffrent style Croats all around it makes our country special
It is a miracle that all Croats now are united in one country(Herzegovina exception) together under one flag
I think that is most Slavs tbh, with Poles being a prime example
Does a Hungarian/Austrian grip come close
It's a very common misconception, but people of Dinaric Alps andd their respective countries are taller than the Dutch
Link please
>Cyprus is Greece too
Woof
Turks there too
>And, heh, Turkey is not European
Heh, it's as European as Russia
Istria
Croatia is pretty culturally diverse for such a small country but Istria is percieved as the most different one
Before 1945
it was never fully part of Croatia, they have noticable Italian minority and also a large percent of population from less developed ex-Yu countries
Therefore they have the strongest regional identity and many of them are Istrians first and Croats second (also on the last census more than 10% of population declared as Istrians which is unheard of in rest of the country)
It's the most developed and least nationalistic region as a whole, their regional party rules in almost every county they run for office and left wing parties win more than 70% of votes in every elections
Love it of hate it it is the odd one out in many aspects
Međimurje in the north of Croatia
Zadar man is our Florida man iirc
Funny how Greeks literally had the same statement
That is a slighty controversial topic but imho native Istrian Croats and Italians aside, a large portion of people pushing hard for Istrian identity are second or third generation Serbs, Bosniaks, Montegrins etc
who find it much easier to identify with non-national Istrian identity rather than Croatian one because of our shared history with those groups
Considering Istria is more liberal and left wing then rest of the country it certainly makes sense for them to do that
Not trying to count blood cells of other people but this is how I understand this topic after talking with some of my Istrian friends from university
No, we istrians hate tourists
We actually flay them on the main square every second sunday in a month and during the full moon
There's a way around it tho, many tourists who want to visit istria disguise themselves as deaf and mute locals, that way they can enjoy the sea and nature without exposing themselves with foreign language
You better not be asian or black tho because we dont have those in istria and we'll be able to see through your disguise
The other way is to learn "bo". Its only used in istria and it means "i dont know". You pronounce it quick and fast, like in "turBO". Whenever someone asks you something you just say "bo" and go away, you'll be safe
There is a Hungarian minority there but the [Burgenland Croats] are more numerous
How the hell did albanians get there
I agree
Dont know much about Croatian and Serbian youtubers but they’re not much different
All of them are equally bad
Well I love it
I think ours is ok
A much better alternative imo is U boj U boj from the Nikola Šubić Zrinski opera
It just makes me more patriotic and willing to fight for my country
Isnt that an anthems job
Eh, I personally don't like it, it's too slow and boring - I feel like "U boj, u boj
" from the Nikola Šubić Zrinski opera sounds better and more bombastic, as well as more patriotic
Maybe change up a few of the lyrics to fit and it would be a pretty nice anthem
I really like it
It is just the hymn to Croatian beauty and people's devotion to it which I think fits it just fine
Boring
Just boring
Himna Slobode was better
Your anthem should be the EU anthem ngl
I think a good joke anthem is hej brigade, maybe change up the lyrics a little
I didnt know that, that's sweet
Pretty sure it made the queen immortal
GDR anthem is like 10 times better and more representative of Germany imo
We kinda copypasted it for Yugo's anthem, but we dont need to talk about that
Which one is about wars and fights
The only one that comes to mind is the french one and thats it
Croatian anthem is called "Our Beautiful" and it sings about how Croatia is beautiful and thats it
East asians are for some reason fascinated with us
Here we have this and some koreans lesrning croatian for a play i mean what are they gonna do next
Well doesn't seem especially socialist
It sings of prosperity and a new identity and the word people i sonly mentioned twice iirc
A cry for help, in time of need, await relief, from apple league
I mean "whom" has a proper function, its not interchangeable with "who"
Well, we had people thrown out carried by arms and legs, phsyical fights, people bringing plane toys just to wind up other representatives, shouting, the few that actually come to the parliament sessions just look at their phones
UKs ia definately not civilaised but croatian isn't much better
Honestly, if they were deciding on something like Brexit it would be a shitshow
Lol watch Croatian or Kosovo parliament,that shit is on another level of uncivilized
Lets not forget that time when one of the reps brought female thong and high heels as a gift to the government during the vote about the Istanbul convention
What was the deal with the plane toys
Good point haha
Croatia doesn't need military planes
Goverement decides to buy a used plane from Israel
The deal doesn't go threw because USA demands that israeli tehnology has to be taken out from the planes first (or something like that)
One of the reps decide to gift prime minister and minister of a defence toy planes to replace the one from Israel
Minister of defence angry, throws the toy from the reps hand and wants to fight but others stop him
Whats the story behind the printer/handcuffs
We "lead love", "voditi ljubav".
>Yes, but also, if you have to use word sex, its have sex (imati seks), but it really is wierd
It's weird in our language and it's word for word translation from English
What is natural
Jebati se
My grandma used to tell stories, how older women used poppy to calm their children
When I say, used poppy, I mean, they made heroin and drugged their children
Today poppy is used usually for baked goods and is common, I'd say
Used as cooking ingredient, but not that much
Weeds that grow by train tracks
We have makovnjača in Dalmatia too, I heard it was brought during Austria-Hungary
We have the same thing as the bird language you described but we use "p" instead of "v".
I didn't know that it's well know in Serbia as well, that is very cool
Because sometimes when I mentioned šatrovački to my friends that are from southern parts of Croatia, they wouldn't know what I was talking about
If someone wants to hear more, there is also this song that is originally recorded this way
[Song]
Apparently, it's common in ex-Yu capitals so this makes sense (I'm from Zagreb)
[Battle of Krbava Field in 1493] we lost a lot of our nobility that day and it kinda reduced our standing compared to the Hungarians
I think by changing the course of that battle Croatian independence would be more likely to happen sooner
Also the turkish advance would be halted
Prevent the assasination of Franz Ferdinand
Contrary to popular belief, WWI wasn't set in stone, and without this event, it is quite possible that it wouldn't happen at all
Helping to preserve Austria-Hungary would also be a massive benefit
Probably the battle of Pakozd during 1848 in Hungary when the Croats went to Budapest(was Pest an Buda at the time) to stop the Hungarian revolution and save Austria from falling
It was also about Croatia who wanted equal rights as Hungary and Austria in the monarchy
During the battle which was going kind of for the Croatian side our ban Josip Jelačić(he lead the Croats to Budapest but was also an Austrian general and he was loyal to Austrians) was called in to save Vienna and the king from another revolution ao he went and took the armies during battle to save Vienna so while Croats look at the battle as a draw Hungarians took it as a win so that is how you will see it in wikipedia as a Hungarian win, but I would change this battle so that ban Josip Jelačić stayed and won the battle and then went to Vienna and stop the uprising there but I don't know if that is too unrealistic
Also another dude also wrote for Croatia the battle of Krbava against the Ottomans so he explained it well too
Imagine if someone made a hoi mod where this all happens
The Turkish advance wouldn't be halted, as the Turks involved were mainly raiding troops from Bosnia, and not any serious central Ottoman military formation
No way could Croatia muster enough men to fight the main Ottoman army (which numbered at least 100 000 men at full strength, and likely much more)
The other points stand - the loss of the nobility was a severe blow
Though the loss of the Zrinskis in their failed plot was an even greater blow, as it wiped out the last powerful family in Croatia
I'm sure people would have been saying the same today had the Cuban Missile Crisis turned the Cold War into WWIII
"The tensions were enormous", "War was inevitable", "Both sides had plans to invade the other", "The world was a boiling kettle" etc
WWI is only seemingly inevitable with hindsight
There were other crises before the July Crisis, and they ended up being contained and calmed down
There is no reason to assume that had the Archduke not been killed by a Bosnian Serb with ties to Belgrade, a war would erupt anyway
Sure, there were plenty of warmongers in all european countries at the time, but the alliance system wasn’t as entrenched or unchanging as we seem to think today (likely influenced by bloc politics of the Cold War), and the warmongers had many, many opponents in government in all countries as well
I mean, Franz Ferdinand is a prime example there as well - as long as he lived, the Empire would not go to war under any circumstances, period
He was staunchly opposed to any sort of foreign military intervention, as he was focused on plans to build up strength at home
And in the end, the governments of all the other participants were in a similar situation, bellicose-yet-dreading-war
While not entirely comparable to nuclear MAD of the later 20th century, there was a significant fear of war and the devastating effects it would have on a very financially and economically interconnected Europe
I don't if this counts but south slavs have Hajduks and Uskoks that fought against Turks
In unoccupied Croatia they were mercenaries, bandits and freedom fighters that escaped from Ottoman-occupied territories and settled in what little was left of either the Croatian kingdom or in regions under Venetian rule
They went out to raid and pillage Turks, Venetians and basically whoever they could to survive
Over time they gained both Imperial Habsburg (as the Habsburgs were elected kings of the remnants of Croatia) and Venetian patronage, and the two increasingly started using them for their own interests and gains
They ended up being called Uskoci, and after a good run they were disbanded by Imperial authorities for being more trouble than they were worth (once the Emperor wished for peace with Venice)
In Croatia, right now you can get 10 for 15 kn (around €2)
Max price has been set to 12 kn per mask, and there were shortages for about 2 months (March and April)
Pre-pandemic price was about 20 kn for a package of 50
This is for disposable masks
I don't think Yalta affected us much, especially since we split off from the Soviets and did our own thing in '48
EDIT: Typos
In Croatia there is a musical called "Jalta, Jalta", portraying the world "leaders" as corrupted and selfish, and it advocates that they should have left the other countries alone
(Zelena livada being left as no ones land
) It must have affected Croatia somehow, but I'm not quite sure how
Moreover, I have no idea what the opinions of the majority of people are
But at least we got a great musical out of it
[It still impacts Poland a great deal to this very day
A musical
I bet it was
It was a huge amount of territory loss with a lot of German population in it
Anyone would have been upset about it
No matter the involment and the side in the war
Jalta, jalta i pjesma Neka cijeli ovaj svijet, moraš znati za to
Ne znam, ali stavljam to na watch listu
I'd like to copy trains from France
France and Germany are kinda role models for me
Regard to laws and rules from Nordic states
Mentality of the Germans probably because if I copied the richness of some country it would probably be used wrongly and lost but if we think a bit more like Germans we wouldn't be in this economic situation right now
Croatia
Copying Germans since 1438
>outsmarted
I felt this
People will say rakija, but imo the "most Croatian" liquor would be [Pelinkovac] It's known in other countries of the region as well, but it's nowhere near as popular
Jao, uskocio si ispred mene
Ugh tastes so bad
It's yours
We don't want it
First time i ever got really drunk was on my school trip to Hungary when i was drinking Becherovka when i was 16
It was the only thing we were able to find in a gas station near our hotel
Also, on my senior trip to Czechia we went to a Becherovka factory in Karlovy vary
Although half of us was still under age they gave us sampels of different types of Becherovka to try and review
I remember i really liked the Ice&Fire one
Borovniča is the shit, I love it
Yea thats basically the main drink in Croatia as well
Would rakija be considered a liquor, though
It's really not though
It's popular, but I think pelinkovac takes the prize in Croatia
To je isto rakija - baza je lozovača, jedino ima više aroma, nije samo od jednog voća
i absolutely hate the amount of tenses it has
past tenses
ok, manageable, have some sense
six possible future tenses separated solely by semantics and nearly untranslatable from my native to English/vice versa
please stay the hell away from me
I'm assuming there would be much less negative talk about unions and minimum wages
Grouping 87 different cultures and ethnicities, who just happen to live on the same continent, into a single group called European
I think recently someone posted something on r/politicalhumour which was about European politics (Brexit I think) and the mods deleted it on the grounds that politicalhumour is supposed to be jokes about American politics and no other country
Lol
I feel like that and many other conversations which are political which Europe has reached a consensus with (free healthcare good, unions are a right, guns bad) would have been avoided
But I feel like any narrative could be sold in the US under the guise of "they stealin ur freedom" which is why they shreek at government trying to limit their corporate overlords
>He wants to kill people for a living, what a hero
Tbh we also have veterans here but we don't make such a big deal out of it
Acusing everyone of racism even though we have a completely different understanding of race and racial relationships from them
Hell, most of Europe is divided when it comes to these things and pretty much all of us have a relationship with minorities which is not comparable to the American one
This is r/askEurope
I think we do make a big deal out of it, just not that big
At least ours were protecting our country, rather than fighting for oil on the other side of the world
Except a lot of those ""veterans"" are rarely real veterans
I've only met two who were actually in the war,and they refused to tell me about what they experienced, othen then a few things, such as 'oh I was there' and 'I stood by a tank that shot at the enemy'
And it's the media mostly that makes it that big of a deal tbf
> it's still not such a deal as it is in USA
That's mostly what I was trying to say
Well, to begin with, some of European countries never partook in the slave trade
Which means that the historical relationship we had with people of colour is vastly different to those of the US
POC migrated to Europe in various different environments and forms, ie as labour force in Yugoslavia during the Non-Alignment movement
Sure, it is a very niche example, but I am fairly certain you will agree that having a sudden influx of labourers from Africa during the 1950s is vastly different to having generations of people move due to effects of colonialism and slavery
That being said, on a more basic level, the word "gypsy" is going to mean something completely else in Ireland than it would in Bulgaria, and Balkan people use the word "Asian" very differently to the British for example
Citizens of some countries percieve "Muslim" as an racial category, while in the former-Yugoslavia it is a concept that has almost nothing to do with race and everything to do with ethnicity
This is not to say that Europeans are not racist nor that racial splits and issues do not exist - it is only to say that history and cultural context play a crucial role in how these issues come about in the sphere of political
The focus is going to be on Europe
Many places (Croatia included) just use it as you use toilet
And we even write it with W even though we don't have that letter in our language
I hate the entire idea of "respecting veterans", but I didn't know that
Oh well
Sure, but I'm saying that European bias is to be expected
Pretty much what I meant
Surely, there are guns used and are (semi)legal in countries like Croatia (where I am from), Switzerland etc but we agree on the context in which they are used
Some got them from serving in the military, some for licesend hunting etc but in most cases they are not used to hurt another civilian
What I meant is that, in case that the usage of guns would be so widespread it would cause an atmosphere of violence, I am pretty sure most of our countries would agree to ban/heavily restrict their usage
I apologise for not replying directly to you, so I am c/p my reply to another comment in this thread:

Vienna is Beč in Croatian
Not sure about the ethimology
Can't think of any other that is drastically different
We call Vienna "Beč"(Baech) and Slovens call Vienna "Dunaj"(Do-nah-y)
Yes, č and ć are pronounced like "ch" - difference is that č is harder and ć softer, but it is often indistinguishable in conversation
As of valley girls, I'm not sure how they exactly sound like, but I think you are correct
Beč is Turkish originally but idk the etymology and Dunaj definitely comes from Danube
1 kn maybe two gums or two plastic bags in the store
10 kn expensive loaf of bread or a dozen eggs
100 kn normal restaurant meal for one (drink, fries, grilled meat, cake), food for a nice meal for 4 at home (meat potatoes, veggies)
For 1 you can buy 2 pieces of gum
For 10 you can get an ice cream thats pretty good
For 100 you can order a jumbo pizza and buy 6 liters of coca
1HRK - a single chewing gum
10HRK - ~1 liter of petrol/diesel, slice of pizza, some basic sandwich in local bakery
100HRK - starter, main meal and drink, or almost three BigMac meals
Wasn't subway meal deal 6-6

F kao Frend je zabava prava (F for friend is truly the joy)
U je za Uvijek tu (U is for always nearby)
N je za Nikad tužan nisi ti (N is for you to never be sad again)
*u moru su sretni svi* (under the sea everyone is happy)
P.S. I quit trying to make the last translation less creepy
• F kao frend je zabava prava - F like a freind is real fun
• U je za uvijek tu - U is for always being there
• N je da nikad tužan nisi ti (U moru su sretni svi) - N is for never being sad (Everyone is happy in the sea)
I made it less creepy I think
F is for friend is the true fun
U is for always here
N is for youre never sad
because everyones happy in the sea
there, less creepy
Pretty OK
Being in a hurry makes oxygen brain not much and me brain kill

First half of 1st grade you do print and then you learn cursive
Honestly idk how people can *not* write in cursive
Its so much quicker and it can look good (although mine doesnt)
Both but i write in cursive
We learned both but basically after learning cursive kept using that
Cursive
And by the time of 6 and 7th grade, 95% of students teach themselves printed letters becuase it's way quicker, more readable, prettier and more compact to write
We were taught both
Since when is cursive faster to write
Well you're forced to write in cursive until you graduate so it makes sense that most people here keep writing in cursive
You're not
All through high school some people would write in print no one said a thing
In my high school you can write any way you want in book but on tests you must write in cursive
We were forced to write in cursive
If you didn't then whatever you wrote wasn't taken into account
* Tourists are overcharged a lot of things
* "The Expensive Rose" - A person offers you a rose for your SO, and when they hand you one, they ask for a ridicolously high price
* Some people go around, pretending to be deaf, and ask for donations - the worst part is, the actual institute does need money, but people are now wary of paying because of scammers
And here's one I've seen only once, but it worked:
* So, during an event, a person wearing a "STAFF" shirt approached a girl and asked for her ID, she pulled out her wallet, as just as she took out her ID from her wallet, the fake staff member swiped her wallet and ran
bro, I went to a restaurant and ordered a pizza
should've gone to McDonald's.
Like a very tasty thing
Yes please
It's quite expensive here nowadays
Dalmatinska Zagora - people are very primitive there
Split, it's like Croatian Florida
Maybe
If you asked me a decade ago, I'd say hell yeah
But things changed
I got married and have kids now, making moving away more difficult
My country joined EU, which means migrating to other EU countries - should I choose to do so - is way easier and requires far less paperwork compared to USA, making them more attractive
However, if I got offered a six figure salary job with decent benefits, I'd certainly consider it
I certainly would, but for 15 years
You see Europe has got a nasty demographics issue, many people will retire and most of the European countries will suffer from lack of demand for local products, lack of taxable population and growth of people in need for pension, that will cause a HUGE rise in taxes and I'm sorry but I'm not planning on paying most of my income to the government
EDIT: Tbh Europe getting fucked up doesn't sound so bad after reading these comments
I recently saw a clip on Youtube where a motorcyclist had a camera attached to his helmet and a car ran into him
It broke my heart when people approached him and asked if he wanted an ambulance (as he was seriously hurt) after which he replied he doesnt want one as he is unable to afford it
They share
If I know as much as a guy, they share even more amongst themselves
I think it's a pretty ok topic to talk about in Croatia, but I'm also a bit biased as my mother is the most open person I've ever seen, and no topic is off the table for her
Depends on the region, but in Slavonia:
Čvarci, Smoked bacon, Pig fat spread on bread an sprinkled with paprika, Kulen, Smoked sausages, Smoked ham
Any of those meals with a side of onions and some fresh cheese and for drink, a shot of Rakia or couple of glasses of Wine
Croatia-Hrvatska
Georgia is also Gruzija in Croatian
I mean there's the occasional dog or cat, but not muxh
Foxes and čagljevi(idk the translation but it is a dog-fox mix animal, basically a doggy fox) roam around all the time along with other smaller mammals
I once went to school and a fox was walking with me for a good 100 meters
But we all gotta be careful for any sick foxes
Everyone is talking about climate but ignores the historical ascpect
First of all the mediterranean had the most developed societies in Europe till the late middle ages
A developed and rich society is where food is not just something you need to survive but you make something more out of it
Olive oil is great, but if you need to produce a lot of food with high caloric intake to survive, olive oil is useless
The second thing is trade
The mediterranean was for a long time the center of trade in Europe, which among others means they had spices from all around the known world
When the trade centers shifted to the north, things changed
Tea became popular in England not because of climate but because they had access to it through trade
A lot of our food is not mass produced, in a lot of mediterranian countries what you guys consider "organic food" - its just considered "food".
Add the abundance of sun, nature being cleaner due to lack of industrialisation/overfishing etc, a natural non-aversion to herbs and spices, general better respect for food than in the north and you got yourself a winning combo
What I meant is that, if you are "working class" in southern europe, localy grown high-quality food is actually quite easy to obtain, unlike in the UK (where I live now), where you have an abundance of cheap food but most of it is of disgusting quality
And because of my previous point the whole "organic" point still stands - most of us do have access to foods which are found to be "organic" (localy grown) for little to no money, which is not the cases for the UK
I never said they aren't, I am saying working class in SE as opposed to the W/NE
You just blew my mind
The same as in English, Sveto Rimsko Carstvo
But to be more accurate and official, people sometimes add Njemačkog naroda (of the German Nation) *or* Njemačke narodnosti (of German nationality)
"Sveto Rimsko Carstvo (Njemačke Narodnosti)" = "Holy Roman Empire (of the German People)"
Sveto Rimsko Carstvo - literally just Holy Roman Empire
Well in usual terminology we call it: **Sveto rimsko carstvo** -Holy Roman Empire
But, the *full* name for it officially is: **Sveto rimsko carstvo njemačke narodnosti** - THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE OF THE GERMAN NATION
In Croatian we call it “Sveto Rimsko Carstvo Njemačke Narodnosti” (Holy Roman Empire of German Nation)
Bohemia, Low Countries, Slovenia, northern Italy, Burgundy
not German
Yes, with the same level of success as your guys
They are mostly riddiculed
There were lingual purists in Croatia back in the 90's. Luckily the trend had faded away since
There are still attempts to create Croatian words for loans, but unfortunately they end up ridiculed and noone takes them seriously
I wish there was a more successful movement to preserve our heritage
fewer and less
can't bother at this point with thrm honestly
also, turtle/tortoise
i know the difference i just frankly think the distinction is stupid and i just don't bother w it
Pope John Paul II
In Croatia, nationalists are obsessed with Franjo Tuđman, while most left-oriented old people idolize Josip Broz Tito
Landgenoten
Stille Willem
Was the Sava named after him
I hate that they named Zagreb's airport after him
It is such an ugly name
There has been a suggestion to name it "Golubica" (Dove) and it got rejected
It would've been such a nice and fitting name for it
Or to just keep it as before, "Pleso". Oh well
According to wikipedia, [it is much older]
I think it would be much better to name it after one of our many scientists like Faust Vrančić. Anyways I agree with you that the current name sucks
Exactly
Croatian conservatives are unanimously praising Tuđman, but most of them are divided on Pavelić.
Imagine if we named it Nikola Tesla just to piss off the Serbs
Homophobes
Of course it does
True
But no matter how much I like the EU I'll take no Holocaust, no cold war, no European cities leveled to the ground, no generations of young men slaughtered twice, any day of the week
Not at all, I'm at home everywhere
Not Reddit per se, but I’ve noticed a similair thing on several discord servera I use
I feel a massive divide between myself and the americans, while I have no problem at all talking with fellow Europeans
The servers are varied in topic and population, and are all international, so it doesn’t seem related to a particular demographic
Last 3, scientists, not celebrities
Big difference
They actually contribute something to society
Disclaimer: I regard celebrities only as persons who are famous because they are famous, ie
Kardashians
I do believe actors, musicians and etc
Do contribute to society
Who the fuck thinks that in Europe, except perhaps some Turkish immigrants in Germany
I find it funny how we accuse Americans of this, but you correctly said the anglosphere
The Brits, even though in lesser numbers and to a lesser extent, are similarly guilty of the same crime of assuming everyone lives/should live like them
Well Mechanical engineering is a branch of science that deals in applying science to everyday life and needs
Oh, I wasn’t really aware of that
Zagreb: The capital, the place where a quarter of the population and a third of the country's wealth is located
The only actually big city in the country (sitting at around 750k population, with a metropolitan area reaching over 1,1 million), and generally the only place worth living in for the majority of professionals in any field
At least according to it's inhabitants
Rich, according to Croatian standards anyway, and very central European looking
Likes to be called little Vienna, but I'm not sure about that
Split; Second largest, de-facto capital of the littoral part of the country
Significantly smaller, and significantly poorer than the capital
Seems to be increasing in crime recently
Has Diocletian's Palace as it's city center, which is quite impressive
Touristy as fuck
Rijeka; Third largest, or just about, known for a very cool mix of mediterrannean and central european architecture
Also, has quite a lot of functional and non-functional industrial architecture (old factories from the Austro-Hungarian era and newish refineries and shipyards), so it's cool for people who like that sort of thing, but also ugly for people who don't. Prides itself on being liberally minded and open to multiculturalism
Big port city
Osijek: Second largest continental city, after Zagreb
Emptying quickly (though not as quickly as its surrounding countryside), and on the poorer end of the spectrum
Definitely the most east-european looking and feeling city in the country
Pula: Northernmost big-ish coastal city, presiding over the Istrian peninsula
Culturally most distinct from the rest of the country, with strong Italian influences
Has a pretty nicely preserved Amphitheater right in the city's center, and tons of relatively impressive Austro-Hungarian military architecture - it was the main Imperial and Royal naval base, and the surrounding system of defensive fortifications bears witness to that
Just had a big shipyard go under, which was the last of it's heavy industry
Zagreb: Christmas market
Dubrovnik: Game of Thrones
Split: Dioclecians palace
Rijeka: Carneval
Zadar: sea organ
Pula: Roman arena
Dubrovnik: well,there was this show
Also for Split: Croatian Florida
How do you think the kosovo situation will resolve
I'm guessing you wont be able to join without recognizing kosovo, right
And recognizing kosovo feels like a political suicide in serbia, whoever does it will probably be branded as a traitor by most so what do you think will be a solution to this problem
What's the general opinion in serbia regarding EU vs kosovo
Maybe i'm mistaken but i feel like older people are mostly against the EU since they still look at russia as their savior and saint while younger people prefer the EU so they can gtfo from there as soon as possible
>Here's the thing, I don't see why Serbia would need to recognize Kosovo
The EU certainly can't demand this when it's own member states don't recognise it
>The EU only requested normalisation in relations which is a viable thing
Kosovo would stay frozen as it is for the time being
You're also correct that it would be political suicide even to suggest such a thing
Oh, i thought its one of the requests
But yeah, that makes sense
Until many years from now when kosovo starts the proccess of joining the union themselves
Would be pretty stupid to have a union where a member is not recognized by other members of the union
>Most agree that the EU isn't worth losing Kosovo (or at least losing rights to Kosovo), it's too important to us culturally, historically and not to mention our people and cultural sights are in danger there so it's basically betrayal at that point
Betrayal by who
Kosovo albanians
I feel for you and i'm on your side regarding kosovo but i just think that sometimes it's better to count your losses and carry on looking in the future
Right now i feel like kosovo is huge ball and chain pulling you back
In my opinion i'd always pick EU over something like kosovo, if it came to that
Regarding your people and cultural sites being in danger, i find that hard to believe
What do you mean by that
Albanians destroying old churches and attacking serbian people on the streets
>Actually it's not like that at all
In most EU countries the older generations are right wing here it's basically 50/50 with older and younger people
Yeah, same here
>Here's the general consensus, most would like to join the EU AND keep good relations with Russia
Russia is an important friend to Serbia, maybe more than the EU since they fiercely don't recognise Kosovo, losing such an important ally isn't in our interests
That's true but can it be done
Will russia not mind you joining the EU
I guess they'd mind if you joined NATO, right
Also don't know, but I doubt it happened overnight
It was probably a gradual process that lasted through several centuries
Like most surnames, I assume no one thinks that a Smith has an actual blacksmith in his family haha
Lived in Denmark and Germany for total of 5 years and now going back to Croatia again this year
I do, however, plan on comming back to Germany in few years again
Important to note here is that I moved cause of work and school
to me it is not a big deal where I am, as long as I can have a decent life
But, I am still happy to go back home for a while
I missed Croatia
I came back to Croatia from Germany recently too, unfortunately not willingly but rather due to COVID-19
I must admit I missed it a lot and I'm happy to be back, however I don't think I could ever work here
The work mentality, stupid management, bad system and toxic colleagues all pushed me away
Now I can't wait to go back to DE
You see
this mentality, stupid management, bad system and toxic colleagues have been present in my workplace here in Germany as well
The company is German, job position is a great one (fashion industry and clothing), colleagues are German and yet the same sh*t has been happening
Many people have quit from this company due to boss screaming at them, terrorizing them for small mistakes, having social hierarchy in the company, massive gossips and dramas, everyday crying by the female coleagues cause someone yelled at them
You cannot escape this no matter the country
In the end, it is all up to you how you handle it
I personally did the following, I waited for my trial period to end and got the full contract on unspecified time period
So, I was basically untouchable in the company as lomg as I did my job
And then, I had a little talk with my boss
Called him out on his behaviour, his managers' behaviours and treatment of the collegaues, imposible deadlines and unpaied long overtimes (we stayed in the company for more than 2 hours overtime each day, which is illegal in Germany
Also some of them slept in the company as well due to overtime) and all the other little details
After that talk boss never spoke to me directly and when he did he spoke nicely and professionally
I stayed after that in the company for another year and finally I decided to quit and move one to something better I found
Germany, Denmark, Croatia, USA or any other country for that matter
there is no escaping the morons and mistreatment
It is not the country's fault
So in my opinion, having this mentallity that "Croatia sucks" and I will be better treated for my work and my time in "Germany, Denmark
" is all a delusion
You won't. It is all about the money that the company cares

We have 5 kuna (HRK) coin in Croatia and it's also quite big
We also had a 5 HRK note, but that didn't last long
Fun fact: our notes were designed based on DM
We also have special 25kn coins that *are* quite rare
They are also about double the size of the 5kn coin
I have a few of those
Same :)
Why is this surprising
We actually have Kauflanad in Croatia but we don't have Aldi

Well yeah but Pewdiepie
What is the worst song your country sent to Eurovision
For Croatia, the lowest point ever was definitely 2006 when we sent Severina with the utter trash of a song called [Moja štikla]
By God, I wanted to gauge out both my eyes and go van Gogh on both of my ears
I still cringe when I remember that horrible rubbish
We were generally between meh and pretty terrible for years now
I was curious how would Damir Kedžo do since he's a really solid vocalist, but, well, corona
it's Moja stikla (translation My high heel)
just a description of how dumb of a song it is: My brother and I were 8 and 10 years old and had a sleepover at grandparents' house when the choice for the Eurovision song was on tv and they let us call to vote for one song
So we decided it would be so fun to find the dumbest song, the one with zero chance to win, and call and vote for that song
We were dying laughing the whole evening until the winner was announced
The song we voted for as a joke- won and went to the Eurovision
Croatia is seriously limited with the impossibility to plagiarize some foreign song and send it to Eurosong
Plagiarizing, which is a common practice of the music scene in Croatia, can help us send some better songs to Europe, present our culture in a more favorable light, and gift Europe with our national genius that is so far more evident in corruption, fake democracy, or rampant emigration
Remove the barriers
Oh wow I feel the Mediterran out of that song
Like yeah, we will protest, but 5 people will come out at max
Whoever made those captions is as close to God as any Pope
That song feels like it should have some fireworks or some big and memorable dancing
This just looks forgettable
If you are trying to find a method to that madness of a song
Don't bother, there isn't one
As I said, that song is just a friggin word salad
Lol, it's trying to be women empowerment, but fails as most parts have no connections
She is singing about how she is rejecting guys, then the chorus is " the grass dosen't grow where my high heels lands". The best parts are definitely those random s-s-s-sex and when the guys start singing as they are basically narrating what they put in the sandwich and she finishes with Africa Paprika
She's also one of the biggest stars in Croatia and there is even a porn about her
>She's also one of the biggest stars in Croatia and there is even a porn about her
She was a singer before she became famous
My absolute favourite is the flag Ban Jelačić took into battle
Or the Kingdom of Croatia (Austrian subdivision)
[This one] .
The modern one is a heraldic travesty, and I the old one represents the country better
I think the state flag is so much better than what you have
It looks like it was made in MS paint
I think the Kaiser naval flag is best
[Digital version of the Jelačić's flag]
[The flag itself]
It would look like a racing flag
It's too boring
Wonder if jealousy and jalousien have anything in common and why
in Croatia there is ljubomoran (jealous) and zavidan (envious) and they are used completely diferently
ljubomoran/jealous is for romantic relationships mostly and zavidan/envious is more general and used more often
Amazing :D Thanks
Three main dialects and each with probably hundreds of regional variants
In some cases you can pinpoint someone's hometown from it
Some are more understandable, but in many cases it is almost a different language
I'm truly interested, can Serbians (or any other nationality from Balkan) understand Dalmatian dialect something like [this] Or something from Međimurje like [this] tho I guess some Slovenians can understand Međimurski better than some Croatians
What are some of the weirdest Serbian dialects
No Slovenia and Czechia were in the same union . It included parts of Poland, Ukraine, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Romania, Italy, and Hungary
I still don't get how Australians ruled over such a huge chunk of Europe in 19th century
Australians were always known for being lovers
I think it's funny how some notable people in AU have different legacy in each country
Somebody like Ban Josip Jelačić (Jellachich, Jellasics) is considered a national hero in Croatia, a traitor in Hungary and a Rebel in Austria, while somone like Franz Ferdinand is considered a Good guy among Croats and apsolute asshole by the Serbs
>Salzburg: music probably (maybe some art and historians too
Footballers and sports fans as well
Red Bull Salzburg is a pretty big deal in European football
> Maastricht : culture, food, history
Damn cool history it is
The famous musketeer D'artagnan died at the siege of Maastricht in 1673

Hm, let's see
Serbo-Croatian, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Turkish, Hebrew, Latvian, Norwegian, English, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Polish, Finnish
These are the ones I can think of right now
Croatian, English, German, Dutch, French and Spanish
Russian, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Turkish, Spanish and Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian/Montenegrin

Thank you guys
They're torn between living in glorious city or breathtaking Alps
>But also no vote
Yeah, about that
Havent seen a single balkan person comment here so that just makes me think that the weird but real political parties are governing the country right now
In Croatia one dude tried to be president and in his presentations he would openly say that he wants to rob people and other nations
When they asked him what does he think about NATO he said that he wants to steal money from them because everyone does
He ended up getting a lot of votes
From 12 candidates he was 5th
Every single party in Croatia is a really weird joke
Imo it would have to be the party of Ivan Pernar (SIP - Stranka Ivana Pernara)
It's politics and claims are just, very weird
Neutrality, Euroskepticism, Recognition of Palestine, etc
I'm surprised nobody mentioned the guy who wanted to name his party Milan Bandić. He's funny as hell
What is the smallest country that you would consider big
Use any metric you want
I'll go woth Albania
When you look at a map of Europe, the size of Albania is large enough that its borders are quite hard to miss
Conversely, you won't notice the borders of Malta, Luxembourg, Armenia, Slovenia or Faroe islands unless you're actively searching for them on the map since their land size is much smaller
Well I have a really generic answer - Zagreb
It's my home city as well as the biggest city and the capital
But hey, it's got everything you need, nature, suburbs, and city life
Also I really like the culture and the atmosphere of the place
I really like Varaždin as well, a much smaller city northeast of Zagreb (my extended family is from the area, and it's a really nice place), and Rijeka
Rijeka is a cool industrial port city that's this blend of Mediterranean and Austro-Hungarian, with a history that's honestly more interesting than that of Zagreb
Agram, tak imam te rad
Edit - because my grammar was all over the place
Split for sure since everything criminally related or things that don't happen in other parts in Croatia happen there
I don't know any answer besides Zagreb either, Varaždin would be a contender maybe but I haven't been there yet
Zagreb has something for everyone and has a really nice vibe when you think about it
Worst city is probably Vukovar unfortunately, won't ever be the same
Croatian per se is meh, but if you include everything in Serbo-Croatian (as one should), then it's great
I'd even say they're up to par with the English ones, honestly
I dont think were that good
We just post funny images from our daily lives

I think it’s fun how there are Croats who emigrated to New Zealand in 19th century and married and had children with women of Maori descent
These people of Croatian-Maori descent are referred to as Tarara, and Tarara Day is celebrated on March 15th
Croats have emmigrated (and still emmigrate) to various countries, mostly the US, Germany and more recently to Ireland but it's a little known fact that Punta Arenas, one of the most southern cities in the world has a significant croatian population
Some sources even claim that half of the town's population is of full or partial croatian descent
There is even a cool video about the [topic]
Fućkaj se, sjetio sam se Tarare i sad gledam da nisam jedini koji se toga sjetio :D Budem samo ekipu iz Punta Arenasa pustio

Oh it's super easy to find if you are Bosnian or Croatian
Do you call [this] Burek sa sirom or Sirnica
Yup Sirnica is Bosnian
It's common for Bosnians to say that we are uncultured savages for calling it Burek sa sirom
We sent a majority Serbian delegation to Belgrade to negotiate the way Croatia (State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs) would join Serbia with a paper dictating Croatian stances on crucial points of the union (federative territorial arrangement, parliamentary monarchy and such stuff
The delegation simply threw the paper out during their trip and said we're joining without preconditions
This led the Croats into 2 failed states, years of oppression and numerous crimes against them
And a single wrong turn
You're not the only ones, mate
More land for Serbia, that's why

Well I personally like our names very much but names in English don't really have a translation but Hungarian and German do and I'm quite fond of them but Serbian doesn't sound good, example:
Osiijek-Croatian/Esseg-German/Essek-Hungarian/Ocek-Serbian
Valpovo-Croatian/Valpo-Hungarian
Kneževi Vinogradi-Croatian/Herzegszollos- Hungarian
Varaždin-Croatian/Varasd-Hungarian
Donji Miholjac-Croatian/Alsomiholjac-Hungarian/Unter-Miholtz-German
Beli Manastir-Serbian actually/Monoštor-old name on Croatian/Pelmonostor-Hungarian/Manoster-German
Yes, even villages but to be fair in Baranja there are a lot of Hungarians too and not just there also a few villages in the heart of Slavonia like Laslovo/Laszlovo  or Korođ/Korogy
We also have a lot of Italian names for coastal towns in Croatia which sound very Mediterranean to me and nice
Croatian vs
Italian
Pula - Pola
Poreč - Parenzo
Rijeka - Fiume
Zadar - Zara
Split - Spalato
Dubrovnik - Ragusa
Vis - Issa
In Hungarian, Croatian, Serbian and some other maybe, Vienna is called Becs/Beč/Беч and in Slovenian and Slovene as the other repoy said it is called Dunaj
Almost all elvish in modern fantasy is inspired or outright stolen from welsh and Irish
Oh yes I forgot the Italian names they are very nice sounding too
Kneževi vinogradi literally means prince's vineyard or duke's vineyard(Knez meaning duke but we can go with prince too and Kneževi is the same word but as an adjective) and Miholjac means st
Michael and it is same in both Hungarian and Croatian and even German as I wrote(Unter-Miholtz)
Also fun fact some names of towns actually kept the name varos(town in Hungarian) in their names like Vukovar, Daruvar or Bjelovar(all having "var" in the end) and in Hungarian Diakovar is Đakovo
I thought var is just short for varos but anyway Vukovar actually means river Vuka that flows into Danube in Vukovar so it would be Vuka castle and Daruvar comes from the Hungarian Daru and var as you said and Bjelovar is what it is probably but idk what is Diakovar/Đakovo
Whole Slavonia probably  (joke, but kind of not at the same time)
We just skip the middle and move to either USA or Germany

Eggs always in the fridge
We buy milk kind of in bulk so 1 carton always stays in the fridge (the one we're currently murdering by drinking) while the others stay in the pantry, awaiting their fate, mourning their fallen comrades
Eggs, always
Milk depends
We have pasterized, long lasting milk that we usually put in fridge only when we open it
For fresh milk it is sold in fridges and kept in it
Yes, both is refrigerated at shops and at home
It weirds me out not putting it in the fridge
I used to use the Croatian QWERTZ, but I switched to American QWERTY, although I still use QWERTZ on mobile
QWERTZ with č ć đ ž and š, some other things are moved around as well, such as parentheses being on 8 and 9
QUERTZ with šđčćž on the right side of the keyboard (if on computer/laptop, on the phone i just use QUERTZ bc i type without these letters)

You would not be invited next time if you didn't share while bringing nothing is usually ok
Well, not exactly a loophole in the strict sense, but its a "fun" thing in croatia that gets mentioned every time someone big gets sentenced
In Croatia lots of people, especially shady businessmen and private investors have dual citizenship in bosnia
So if/when they are sentenced (eg embezzelment, money loundering, war crimes, tax fraud, vehicular manslaughter) usual course of action is to go to Bosnia & Herzegovina and live (rule) from there since they tend not to extradict their citizens to Croatia
Its almost funny, but its very annoying/enraging

Zagreb
Not specific enough :)
Well I'm gonna go here and only talk about standard Croatian accents not the dialects
So the Croats in and around Zagreb mostly have an accent on the end of words rather than in the first part
They aren't really annoying they just speak but Herzegovian Croatian is fucked up, they talk very annoyingly, somehow speaking very fast but still lengthening words and putting accents in the front and then when speaking poundering the first part of the word with the accents (krAva-standard, krAAAva-Herzegovian alsonthe word means cow)
Then Istrias just speak weirdly like their accent is like Australian to British and Dalmatians like to lengthen words and putting the "i" sound everywhere
Then Slavonians just talk slowly having accents in the front but just generally speaking slow except for the northern part which speaks a little faster
Other accents are from the mountains and they are mostly mixed and the northernmost part speaks its own language
Its not that important
But it does inply class a bit
Like if you have a Lika accent or a harecore Kajkavian accent you're most likely a village boi, etc
croatia, i dont think there's any single accent that's posh unless you are talking in a painfully standardized manner
even people from the south (where the standardized language comes from) and the capital have things to nake fun of about their accents
any accent can be "uneducated" if you emphasize it enough but mostly it's the rural accents (of which there are many) that take the role
Agree with you on that
I don’t think anyone would even notice you’re alone in Croatia, people generally don’t care about that
That being said I still prefer to have company while eating out, but that’s personal preference
8 cultural and 2 natural, most famous would be Plitvice Lakes and Dubrovnik Old Town

Should burek with cheese be classified as a burek or a cheese pie (sirnica)
This debate has been going for a very long time and we're no closer to an answer
I'm pretty sure that a war will start because of it at some point
I just think that people are overreacting
I could agree that in Bosnia burek is only with meat, but in Croatia it can be with anything because burek is a Turkish dish which came to Croatia through Kosovars and Ottomans
I mean, if Bosnians can put mayonnaise on pizza, why wouldn't we put cheese in it
We've got the bell pepper kind and it's always with rice and ground meat
Other variant is shredded potatoes bacon inside bellpeppers and then baked while covered with an egg and sourcream mix
We've loaned those words from you - paradajz, palačinka, krafna (all singular)
Horvatia
Closer to Hrvatska than Croatia but still pronouncable i think
I would change the name for Croatia because it is not even close to the Croatian name for Croatia which is Hrvatska but I don't know if people would easily pronounce Hrvatska so I would stay with the name Croatia
But the word Croatia comes from the french word for tie which is something like Croata and they called us that during the napoleonic wars when Croats would go into battle with ties around their necks, so you can probably call us Tieland instead of Croatia too
I would change it to Hrvatia
I would rether use Itallian "Croazia". It sound much nicer
We call you Mađarska so it doesn't sound that stupid to me
Also it's closer to Magyòrszag so it makes more sense
Nah, it's actually the opposite
The word for tie came from the word for Croats
The reason for the difference of Hrvatska and Croatia is because the Latin language didn't have the H, so they wrote Hrvat as Crvat, as the C sound was the closest they could get to the H. Then that eventually evolved to Croat
Tieland is waaay too close to Thailand, also getting Croatian people to start using the word Croatia would be a bit of a problem
Croata sounds similar to the Croatans
Croatia used to be called Horvatska before we dropped the O. The Horvat surname to us is what "Smith" is to the anglosphere
Isti sir drugo pakiranje
That's how it works in Croatian
The country is "Nizozemska" and your language is "Nizozemski"
If you pronounced it with your gutteral sounds it would sound like a tumor coming out of your mouth
I think "Kovač" or "Kovačević" is "Smith". You know blacksmith=kovač.
I'm a big fan of scandinavian names but they are pretty uncommon in croatia, other than sven and erik
I'd love to name my kid bjorn but people would just think that i'm a self centered hipster
So we named him vigo, still a bit scandinavian but normal
Also, while we're at it, while googling for cool names we found Ganja on the list of popular scandinavian names
Wtf
Does anyone know someone called ganja
Edit: [here's] the screenshot i dug out from february 2nd of this year
It was from some app my wife had which followed her pregnancy or something
I'm not sure
I love the name Jezebel, but, ya know,
Adolf
Not becouse of culture i know few people with germanic names but becouse of ehh
I know someone with "Anamarija" as their name (not sure how it's spelt though, together or apart), so i guess it could work
I think it's spelled together -or atleast, that's how the one I knows spells it
[Found the screenshot] if you're interested
Yeah, probably since i cant find it anymore
Who knows
Ganja means cannabis everywhere in the world
dude, i know
it's like that everywhere
that's why it's so funny and that's why i asked in the first place :D
I have them but i dont wear them often becuse i own only few of them
UK, well London specifically, it was okay but very underwhelming, especially compared to other European capitals
I like Austria, been there many times
Last time just before then pandemic in December of 2019
in Wien
Commented with my friends how Austria is what Croatia should've been and Wien what Zagreb had a chance to become but never fullfilled that  expectations
edit: oh yeah and whenever I spray some Boss Bottled I get reminded of Austria
Apple pie scent with warmth of cooked wine
No coastline for others on Mare Nostrum
Vienna, Budapest, Madrid, Copenhagen, Prague, Barcelona (not a capital but still), Venice (from a tourist point of view at least)
Bulgarian -ov
Serbian -ović
Croatian -ić / -ović
Slovenia -ič
Certainly not a rule, but if a surname ends in any of those there is a high chance there it’s from those countries
-ov  possesive (of someone)
-ić  diminutive (little someone)
Croatia has a lot of surnames like - ić
For example: - Martinović, Vuletić, Josipović...
Every couple of days I discover a word on this subbreddit I thought was Croatian but is actually Hungarian
In this case, Kovač (Kovacs), meaning blacksmith
These threads never fail to amaze me, truly
AFAIK (I don't live there) There's also some -eks in Zagorje (probably in Slovenia to IDK)
\-ić is actually not that common for diminutives (the only one i can think of is cvjetić), it's more common fro surnames
That's like saying -ica is diminutive, which it can be, but it's also the feminine ending
Ović and ević is two suffixes I think, where usually slavic patronymics with ov and ev got a south slavic addition
Version of my surname with just -ev is common in Baltics/Poland/Belarus, while -ević is found only here
It’s not completely the same, but similiar, because we say papuče, so papucs with an e at the end
I also learned recently that you guys say Becs for Vienna, we say Beč and I never knew we borrowed the name from you
>often end with -ev, -ov, -ski
TBH those sound more Macedonian than Serbian to me
Not in the slightest
Living in the UK, I see that being able to fluently speak another language is more of a win than anything else
I get to be (at least) bilingual with little to no effort - something I cannot say for the Brits
Also, being exposed to another language(s) from a very early age makes it easier for me to understand languages which are not my native or English and thus easier to learn
Not directly, but it is more or less accepted as a truth that bosnia and herzegovina is a keg of gunpowder once again
They are on the edge of being a failed state (although they've been there for years now), and I think once they break its going to be pure chaos in the region (again)
Well personally, i thing that something big is gonna happen i future in Balkans again
Mostly with BiH, multi national, ethnic and religious country
Its apparent that people within cant work together so i will and has to divide
Hopefully it will be peaceful, or else we risk another war in region or even serious involvement of US and, if Serbians manage to talk them in to, Russian in war
And by the looks of it, some serious money is coming from middle east for support of Muslim in BiH so somebody is counting on new clash down here
Dayton accords are not working as they are now
"Why would I  feel threatened
*Continues living in Balkan country*
im not going in the whole recognizing-it-or-not teritory, but what are your thoughts about future relations regarding Kosovo
Stabile status quo or do you expect some infighting, bickering
I feel like kosovo is to serbia what hercegovina is to croatia - when things get tough politically or economicly , you can always call for nationalism and cause frictions tgere
They farthest they went in Croatia, after they burned half of Hungary and raised Zagreb to the ground, is Trogir
Which is a city on the Adriatic coast near Split
Just think about it, the Mongols came all the way to the Mediterranean, insane
jeez, that guy had really bad luck
Heath must be right in front of his door, and thought, "welp now is as good time as any"
Well, isnt that how dialects work all around the world
Croatia is one of the smallest countries in europe but still a guy speaking only chaikavian dialect would not understand a guy speaking kaikavian
I mean i've been living in zagreb for 15 years now, i could drive few kilometres north and not understand a single word
The war ended 24 years ago
Obsessing over it is what is grinding our country to a halt
Once people realize this, life (and especially politics) will become easier
I dont think thats it .I dont wanna be that guy but hard to swallow pill for you would be that Kosovo will never be what it was again
The French haven't started a referendum to stick it to their closest allies in the first place
I reckon 27 other EU countries agree to disagree
Carthage is in Tunisia, not Algeria
They were Anatolian empire
North Africa was conquered the same way the Balkans or Levant were
But the rest of your point stands
There was very little interaction between North Africa and Europe
Homeland (?) war
Basically the one where we separate ourselves from Yugoslavia
It was like that for the entirety of my existence
All 5 of them every year
Ognjištarci - people around the hearth - extreme conservative Catholics with Nazi leanings, closest to rednecks
Very loud and unpleasant minority
Proud of their "stone genes" and Croatian Nazi past
They love Jesus and at the same time spread antisemitic slurs
Rvatine
Seljacine
Literally never heard the term, is it a regional thing
In Dalmatia we do have the term "vlaj" (comes from the Vlach peoples/historical term AFAIK) that refers to people not from the coast/cites, usually from Dalmatian Hinterland
It almost always caries negative connotations of primitivism/barbarism etc
but every now and again you'll find someone who uses the name for themselves with pride
The "opposite" of the term is "bodul", someone from the islands, but I've never heard it used as an insult, almost always proudly with self-identification, except a few people who insinuated that all islanders are communists, which, uh
I kinda know what he ment but stil
Also:
seljačina/seljober - augmentative of a villager (seljak), but with negative connotations
klošar - the dictionary defines it as a homeless person, but I've never heard it used that way
It usually means someone who is cheap or tacky, especially with their clothing
There are probably others i forgot too
"Genes of stone" is a famous nationalistic song sung by Marko Perkovic Thompson
It says that the best people are Catholics, that grew up in a stony area of Croatia and Herzegovina, mostly villages, and they don't like foreigners, but only God
Here it is with English subs just click on CC
I'd also add đikani to the list
Golden cross around neck, fanny pack equipped, tracksuit, BMW/Mercedes, beats his wife, most likely from Imotski/Hercegovina, listens to extremely loud Cajke even though he is a die-hard nationalist while spraying swastikas everywhere
It is extremely sad
Nobody is born a nationalist, a racist or a homophobe
Kids learn those things
That is the saddest part
Yugoslavia at that time had a huge rock scene that still people today listen
Throwing people in holes
If you find a pit, there is a reasonable chance there is a mass grave inside
Even our most known anti-war poem is called [The Pit] about people being led to their death in the pit
We don't have classes in different languages, but learning German, French or English is mandatory
I've heard Burgenland Croats have some bilingual gymnasiums
Don't know if the Kärnten Slovenes also have them
[Turns out there's only one
It's meant for Burgenland Croats and Hungarians and offers both German/Croatian and German/Hungarian bilingual education
Apparently that's one of the big problems for the Burgenland Croat community, as it's the only one, while Slovenes have two despite there being less of them
Maybe [Istria]
There is no political movement (even though they are often called separatists jokingly) but if you asked an average Istrian he would probably tell you they want more authonomy
It's not really a movement for independence but more for autonomy
Rijeka
They have their own political party that's a member of the European free alliance
Say if they were independent, they'd likeley join the EU
I don't have much knowledge on the subject of Rijekese (?) autonomy
Better to ask a person from the coast than me a continental
Istrian "seperatism" is just a joke
They want more autonomy and be more noticed and special
Kinda like Bavarians in Germany
Really
Which
DO NOT let them
Just give them the same status as Bavaria and you good
You and Italians need to agree first
Well Bosnians appear in a lot of our jokes (Mujo i Haso)
But wait
Is the place Voralberg
Imagine if Burgenland joined Croatia
The borders send shivers down my spine
[It's absolutely beautiful
Had to steal Prekmurje from Slovenia though, sorry Slovenia
You know what
Not as bad as I thought it would be
Imagine a croat empire
Burgenland, Banat, Molise, Patagonia and Pittsburgh
It would be wonderous
"Luk" means bow (weapon), arc, arch and onion
"Duga" means both rainbow and long (female adjective)
"Pas" means dog and waist
"Biti" means to be and to beat
"List" means leaf, piece of paper, a newspaper, a calf, a type of fish and the calf on your leg
Last but not least the most interesting one:
"Gore" means up there, hills, they're burning and worse
So you can make a sentence "Gore gore gore gore" which means "The hills up there burn worse".
Because their languages are extremely similar to English
Seriously Swedish has the exact same sentence structure and grammar as English and a lot of shared vocabulary
It's not that hard for these people to learn English
Definitely more with my nation since we are small as it is
I was reading that there was some study that proves how finns from all over the country are more geneticly distants than let say german and russian
if i may ask how big is the difference in a language
Thanks for clarification
Without any knowledge in finnish to me Rauma dialect just sounds regulsr finnish
Something like our kajkavian bednja accent
That thing is on another level
any word with ts i end up pronouncing as t͡s and the θ and ð sounds if im speking fast become t and d
just go irish and say t
idk maybe this can help you bro
idk maybe this can help you bro
try pronouncing it as bruhzil
Lived in Ireland for years, been in the UK numerous times for various lengths (days, weeks, months), and now live in Germany
It's just different culture
You can see it in many different areas of life, not just drinking
Anti social behavior in general is more prevalent/normal in the UK/IRE than on the mainland, same with the drinking and the consequences of drinking
Portugal is also my choice
Maybe because we are both mediterranean countries but the people, the food, the vine, the feeling, resembles Croatia a lot
But thats expected since they are eastern Europe ;) (im kidding my portuguese friends, love you️)
Spain, but in a weird way
Let me explain, there are really some major differences
However they eat late in the evening, portion sizes in a hotel were top notch ([like french would say] they like basketball, this is actually experience from Zagreb
I was coming home from the city center and some spanish guys asked me where is Dražen Petrović Museum and Memorial center
They have strong left-right political divide just like we have
When I say divide Spain is the only country where I can relate to that divide, it's almost like we are alternate universe, where far-right nationalists won in Spain, communist republicans won in Croatia/yugoslavia and every future aspect of politics will be shaped upon that divide
It's surreal
I can bet that people in Spain still vote depending on whether their ancestors were republican or monarchist
I know, it's like our older generations
Ah yes golden grave and šuker
Guy is an idiot
I remember when I was a kid father asked whose kit I want
I said 1998
away kit with Boban name on it
It was boban or prosinečki actually
Living in Zagreb, our city is situated on the plain that slopes down from the Medvednica mountains
The cool thing about that is, Medvednica is in the north, so you always know where north is, and therefore, the rest of the sides of the world
Also, living in the far eastern parts I can actually see the entire mountain and at the edge of my neighbourhood you can really have a wonderful view of it
It makes sunsets look even more beautiful
Yes
We use MS Teams, but we don't have lessons

Špičkovina (Croatia)
Can't really translate it, I guess you had to be there
Election of HDZ, no doubt
Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people went missing, some of them were found in ireland, germany and other similar countries but the huge majority will never return or be found
TBH, after reading the thread title, even before loading the comments, I expected this to be the top answer
The worst mid air collision happened in [german airspace] The worst part is the russian plane was filled with kids going to a school trip
Not great, not terrible
same shit happened in RI with The Station, there was even a compression that said that normal (flammable) sound isolation costs 2500$ to cover the whole club
It was 5000$ to install fire proof sound isolation, 2500$ difference and they didn't bother to pay that
Ffs they didn't even bother installing fire sprinklers, if only the fire sprinklers were installed there was a huge change no one would die
But hey when you have a friend that's a fire marshal I guess you don't need to have fire sprinklers
What is the cost of lies
man, you're right
i always thought it's the worst one but after a short trip to google i found out i was wrong
could be because during my schooling in germany we talked about that one the most, being over germany, so i just assumed it's the biggest one
even the one over zagreb had more casualties
most of them on the list were during take off or approach while we were talking about collisions on cruising altitudes tho, that could be the reason as well
Schools
When we went on school trips the parents had to pay
Do german schools pay for students' trips themselves
It might just be the case of not knowing what to comment in a situation like that
Sounds better than "welp that person just went into nothingness". As an agnostic, I don't mind people believing in the afterlife, but what triggers me is the "what can you do, that's life, it had to be that way". The amount of people who believe in destiny is ridiculous
What's the point of living life if you truly think everything is out of your control
Depends
If it's online then it goes something like this:
- where are you from
- croatia
- russia
- no, croatia
- russia
- no, cro-a-sha
-aaaa, croazia
If it's in person, far away from europe then it usually ended with them saying "aaa, davor suker, really good". In the last 10ish years davor šuker was changed for luka modrić.
My friend frrom minecraft is also Polish and lives in the UK
Btw their reaction is *Oh i know that country its beautiful*
It has snowed and it melted the very next day
Zagreb and surrounding area
It snowed \~3x but collectively it might have been \~6h of snow total
Once it snowed during the night and it was enough to cover everything white but the next day was like sunny 8°C and it all melted away by noon
I miss snow
Man those commercials are all over the place
You'll see them everywhere from state tv (HRT) to their homeland Nova TV
EDIT: Seriously you don't know how many times I've been tried to sold the new Dormeo mattress, or the super good Delimano pan and some walkmaxx shoes for my aching feet
Especially in the morning when only old people watch tv
I don't think you'll see it after 4 or 5 in afternoon
[I would say this one] it shows a tank of JNA going over a red Fiat 500 when the Serbian army was entering Osijek
A few years ago a "reverse" [monument] was made
Edited: city corrected, Thanks u/usecereni_kupus
It happened in Osijek, not in Vukovar
Anyone from Monaco here
Where is the Isle of Woman
Isle of Elder
im seeing a lot of germanic languages but for real tho, norwegian, 10/10
Finnish, more vowels the better it sounds
I once watched a movie which I liked, but the language wasn't familiar
I was very curious as I really liked how it sounded, but I've never heard of it
After I watched the movie I googled it
The language was Dutch
Only later was I aware of internet's hatred towards Dutch
I really love Portuguese
Slovenian
It sound like a Russian-Croatian mix without any vowels whatsoever
I don't think it's the most beautiful, but I find it interesting nonetheless
Happy cake day
Sretan dan kolača on Croatian
IDK if Habsburgs count as occupation, but we've also had a [Canadian PM] for about a year (technically born in Croatia, but spent most of his life in Canada and barely knows Croatian)
One Croatian PM was born in a Nazi concentration camp
Well, yes, we were under austrian or hungarian rule for almost 900 years
My History teacher tried to claim that people didn't have to vaccine their kids, that people die reguraly from vaccines and a few other easily debunkable arguments
I told her that those people were stupid and then argued with her for the entire class
In the end, she told me I, and I quote, "was not even in high school, so I had no right to pretend to be smarter than everyone and call anyone stupid".
My parents, who are doctors, were mildly pissed, but didn't take any action, because that'd just cause me trouble in school with the teacher
But both of them just said to call her retarded in her face if she tried to argue for something like that
I still hate that history teacher, since she had pretty much no idea of history, and was overall pretty dumb
I remember one time, She claimed to me that Austerlitz, with modern day borders, was in Austria
I told her it was in Czechia
I know because I literally went through there that summer
She then called me wrong and I had to shut up
She also said blatantly false things, but I honestly just gave up on correcting her
I can kinda see why she wouldn't accept the U.S. as an answer because, while it does indeed contain a metric fuckton of ethnicities, a person's ethnicity isn't really *that* relevant
But in countries like Spain (and much of Europe) it is considering ethnic minorities are native to the region and/or settled there in large numbers and kept their identity in a noticeable way
I guess it just depends on how you define multiethnic states, really
Because the vast majority become Americans culture-wise within a generation or two and are virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the population and don't speak the language of their parents/grandparents
Contrast that with ethnic groups like Basques or Catalans for example who speak a different language and are visibly distinct from the majority ethnic group
Besides, Norwegian-Americans eating lutefisk for Christmas doesn't classify as keeping their identity in a noticeable way if they have zero other links to the culture
Plus, when I say settled there I mean it in a 'planned' sense, like when Hungarians settled in the Pannonian basin i.e. when a large group of people with the same ethnic identity settle somewhere in a relatively short period of time
This is obviously different to settlement in America where individuals/families would move and then proceed to disperse around the country
Croat here, also attended "gimnazija" and was taught the grammar school translation
I found it later on to be a stupid translation, probably though up by some older generations, that even people form the UK (where grammar schools are from) don't necessarily get due to their education system beigh wildly different
Therefore, if I want be precise I say gymnasium (always in a context when it's known where I'm from so that it can be checked), otherwise I use secondary education or high school (as it's something that most people understand even if it's not the same)
Just checked on Wikipedia, grammar schools in the UK only exist in some parts of England and Northern Ireland and there are only 163 of them
So yeah, people from the UK probably won't get the right idea from comparing gymnasiums (in ex-Yu countries) to grammar schools
>Some old fashioned nickname was "Bundeshauptstadt ohne nennenswertes Nachtleben" (Federal capital without noteworthy night life)
Germans are so weird
The nickname is over 6 times longer than the name
Love you all
Well, most
I am so fucking dumb hahaha
We know it’s a holiday that exists but don’t actually celebrate it
I'd say one of the poems ( Slap, Oblak, Voćka poslije kiše) by Dobriša Cesarić.
"Gle malu voćku poslije kiše:
Puna je kapi pa ih njiše.
I bliješti suncem obasjana,
Čudesna raskoš njenih grana
"Look at the little fruit tree after the rain:
It is full of drops so it sways them
And it shines lighten by the sun
The wondrous splendor of its branches
The poem is called "Voćka poslije kiše". But, unfortunately, it is very hard to translate it, so it doesn't lose the meaning
In Croatia, we don't have much poetry, but one of the most famous song lines is:
"No rakije, rakije, rakije, amo
Jel utjehe nema u vodi
( Moonshine, Moonshine, give us moonshine,
Because there is no comfort in water )
It basically talks about a group of poor people, that drink to try to forget the state they live in
I’m gonna go with these:
“Čovječe, pazi da ne ideš malen ispod zvijezda
“Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man
” - from a poem called Opomena (Warning), by Antun Branko Šimić
“O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,
dar u kôm sva blaga višnji nam Bog je dô,
uzroče istini od naše sve slave,
uresu jedini od ove Dubrave,
sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki životi
ne mogu bit plata tvôj čistoj lipoti
“O beautiful, o beloved, o sweet freedom,
God has given us all the treasures in you,
you are the true source of all our glory,
you are the only decoration of this Dubrava
All silver, all gold, all human lives
cannot repay your pure beauty
” - from Dubravka, a play by Ivan Gundulić
“Slobode koji nema, taj o slobodi sanja”
“He who does not have freedom, dreams of it” - Moj dom (My home), Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević
“Što se bijeli u gori zelenoj
Al su snijezi, al su labudovi
Da su snijezi, već bi okopnuli
labudovi već bi poletjeli
Nit su snijezi, nit su labudovi
nego šator age Hasan age
“What's so white upon yon verdant forest
Snow perhaps it is or swans assembled
Snow would surely long ago have melted
And a flight of swans would have departed
not swans, not snow it is you see there,
'Tis the tent of Aga, Hasan Aga;” - Asanaginica, by Ivan Mažuranić
And then there is also the poem Horvatska domovina, which later became the national hymn
But still being the first to come to see if they're OK after wiping out

My friends and I don't like it
My theory that could be wrong is it's popular because most people in western europe or good percentage of it is renting their flat
This way flat owner doesn't care for the quallity of furniture and people moving in also don't care since it's not their place
I consider it over-priced low quallity furniture I wouldn't buy
However my cousin is a fan of ikea, she had hand made furniture made from oak, she  threw it out from her flat and bought everything in ikea
Just don't mention the war
Any war
Just don't mention it
It was an F117A, if I remember correctly, and Serbs were good sports about it, they apologized for not knowing it was supposed to be invisible
Luckily I've seen neither
Like one big, happy, disfunctional family
Yes
So you're saying that it's so deeply ingrained with people that our identity is to be the synonym for everything bad and repulsive that there's not even a point in trying to change that
Well isn't that excellent
>I’m saying that it’s ingrained enough that it’s not a “new”
I don't see how that changes anything
>and isn’t really offensive
Well perhaps not to you, I for one don't enjoy my identity being the butt of every joke and the general synonym for everything negative
Especially don't enjoy hearing it every 5min
I don't think we have them in Croatia but I really don't like the idea of those bases since I consider that Europe could defend itself if a EU army was created
Also I don't think it is the best idea to have foreign troops on our land, no matter the NATO because alliances can break over time and we might not keep our "good" relations with USA
But considering that the talks over creating united European army are going nowhere I guess it is normal that the countries that feel threatened want some kind of assist in defence
Do you consider only hot spice as spice
Mediterranean cuisine is full of local herbs and spices
You don't have to eat overpowering and hot third world spices to have spicy food
Not to mention that a Mediterranean diet is much more healthy as those hot spices are risk factor for stomach cancer

Forget about online videos, they are non existant since nobody can load that in time
Chat rooms were the biggest and only fad, i remember going to microsoft chatroom which looked like a comic book, was a really cool design
It looked like [this] you could choose the facial expression as you type
Tbh i dont remember anything else, there were only chatrooms and napster (later came limewire and few others), and ICQ which was something like steam friends list, minus all the games
I can't even recite my own nations anthem let alone other nations anthems
That being said I could probably recognise a few of them if I hear them
eh i only know the first part of the serbian anthem thats it
I know quite a lot of them
Montenegrin, Russian and French anthems are among my favourites
I also know God save the Queen, the German, Serbian, Polish and Italian anthems and some more
I also like the tune of the Spanish one, I wish it had lyrics because I would love to sing to it
The French anthem is kind of a symbol of revolution and such so we know i. Other ones that I know are British, Russian, Spanish(I could recognise it but not sing), Serbian, German and Ukranian (cuz I wondered but same as Spanish tho only recognisable)
Same here
Also Spanish (not so frequent lately, but maybe next year) and Austrian
I also really want to hear La Marseilleaise on F1 podium
Exactly the same
Same here
But I must say, those who have worked hard and fairly don't do it as much the upstart ones
Usually the ones showing off (with branded clothes, big houses and expensive cars) have some sort of complex
Member the time when Kerum placed his Mercedes Maybach behind a window so people can look at it in awe and admire
What
You forgot about the croats
People who moved to germany (especially older people since it's kinda archaic state of mind) like to buy a german car (audi, bmw or mercedes) and then show off when they come back to their village
Like look at me, i made it
Even tho he's busting his ass off mixing concrete on the building site the whole day
Yeah, you made it, good for you
Gasterbajteri, gotta love their mindset
Zabranjena ljubav, a not very good soap opera that ran from 2004 to 2008 plus one more season in 2011, it has a measly total of 805 episodes
More or less, everybody in Croatia doesn't understand two of them, some three
And one little speech nobody understands - Bednjanski
There are so many dialects in Croatia, and a lot of them that people from different regions wouldn't understand
Unfortunately, a lot of these are sometimes based around one or few villages, and are dying out
Yes, but its not just an accent, it's the whole different dialects
[Here's an example]
[And another one with seasonal greetings]
I didn't understand a single word in the first example, aside from the last sentence which I think meant "Give evryone a Žuja (Croatian beer brand)"
Funny, I'm not from the NW Croatia so I didn't have much contact with those dialects, but I managed to understand a good bit
I'd say Bednjanski "mangles" vowels (compared to the regular Croatian) in the way similar to how Bavarian or Austrian does compared to regular German
Here in Croatia we have a lot of snow in specific areas (the north and the mountains, mostly), but where I live (Istria in western Croatia) it snows maybe once a year
I don't think it's that frowned upon
My sister has one on her nose and noone seems t ogive a damn
I personally dont use anything for thousands (maybe space if its illegible)
I tend to use dots for decimals, simply because it's easy to confuse commas when listing numbers with decimals
But I really dont know the official rule
We don't really do thousand separstors
Though sometimes youll see just a regular space used
We also use dots instead of commas
Here we use it "interchangeably", but the correct way to use it is "," for thousands separator, and "." for the decimal point
Didn't know you use points
Rest of exYugoslavia and Europe mostly uses commas
In Croatian you are supposed to have space as the thousands separator (but only 10 000 and above, 9999 would not have a space) and comma as the decimal
I personally have always used space and a decimal dot whenever writing
That’s what I was told in calculus class, but I think the dot is the only decimal separator in mathematics, so that’s the reason our teacher used dots
We do that too:
Milijun      - 1

Milijarda  - 1
000

Bilijarda   - 1

After a quick search, I found that it's a matter od using large or small numbering scale
Majority of European countries use the bigger scale, including us
UK, USA and some others use smaller scale
I suppose smaller scale is popular (even though less people use it) due to popularity of english language, and their cultural influence as per usual
In school i dont recall using anything except space
As communists
Trying to explain that it's not the same takes to much time and it's basically pointless
If you're not Catholic, you're not Croatian - that's the default view for most people
So, I'm a communist
I think it’s quite normalized
My parents grew up in Yugoslavia with the policy of state atheism, even though they still practiced Catholicism
Because they were three dominant religions in the ex-Yu area, it was also quite normal to hear of an atheist child, whose parents came from two different religions
Even today, 50 years later, being an atheist isn’t really a big deal
There are more and more atheists, and I’d say that in my school more than half of the people are atheists, or are going to become one
This is how I view the situation, coming from a fairly liberal family and school, but someone older than me might disagree
As someone already wrote, people (especially older) mark you as a communist and not a real Croat
What is even more interesting, young people are often even more extreme about it, even though they may not practice religion that much
I've witnessed a situation between friends where someone was verbally attacked because they said something about God that the other person didn't like
Church has hold over many things in Croatia, heck, they are even exempt from determined dates of relaxing the coronavirus measures, state is powerlees against them, many priests have been conducting masses despite the ban, and when police and journalists showed up they were attacked and hurt both by people and the priest
The most common judgement would be Orthodox communist
Just pictures of him digging for nose gold
I say Budapest with an "s" but I know it is supposed to be a "sh" sound
In Croatian we say Budimpešta for Budapest and as you can assume the letter "š" is pronounced as "sh"
In Hungarian I think "sz" is for "s" and "s" is for "sh"
I would go with Arabic because of the beautiful complexity; Spanish because it's widely used and finally Irish because when i heard it it doesn't sound like any familiar language to me
Have a nice day people
In my local bar, you can pour water in your glass over the bar if a lot of people are being served currently, altough it's a small bar where most of the time people from village only come
Yup, when one regular died, a candle was lit in front of the bar and everyone that could went to his funeral
All police officers that are on patrol carry a sidearm (either HS2000, CZ 75 or Glock 19), but in certain situations (usually after some incidents) they can be seen carrying Ero submachine gun or M70 rifle
Handguns are part of standard uniform
Long rifles are only present during some barricades, armed prsuits etc
I love how Americas get to be one continent due to Panama canal, but Africa is always taught separate from (Eur)asia even though there is Suez there
In Zagreb, around 5-10% of the total amount of sidewalks have bike lanes
This is a very rough estimate
I guess the infrastructure is really bad, because a few of my close friends have been run over by a car while crossing a road on a bike
Bonus: bikes also get stolen a lot (source: friends whose bikes got stolen)
Bikes get stolen a lot everywhere
50 thousand bikes get stolen every year in Amsterdam alone
Zagreb is not even close to that number
Yeah, the infrastructure in Zagreb is really bad
Even if the bike lanes exist, it is probably not intended for bikes (high roadsides etc
Source for Zagreb
I can't find the info
I found this article
383 bikes stolen in 2015
NOT EVEN CLOSE lol
True, but I think this number is still too low
Might be because of the low confidence in the police or because there is a minimum value of the bike (I don't know a lot about that, but I heard that police are not going to look into the case if the value of the stolen things is less than a few thousand kunas)
Thanks for the article
It would also be interesting to compare how many people are bikeowners in Amsterdam in comparison to Zagreb
"Gore gore gore gore"
means "Up there the mountains are burning worse"
In Istrian (Chakavian) dialect there’s this joke:
What does an Istrian say about a black man in the dark
“Ni ga
” (Read: knee-gha)
“Ni ga” translates to “He isn’t here (or there)”
Yes we are awful
Also: “Up up up up”
But that's awesome
How is it pronounced
Maybe not everybody knows all of these, but anyone who knows just a bit about our history has heard of them:
- Dukes Trpimir, Domagoj and Branimir
- King Tomislav (the first Croatian king)
- King Petar Krešimir IV
(the strongest Croatian king)
- King Dmitar Zvonimir (last king of the Trpimirović dynasty, whose death resulted in dynasty wars, which ended with Croatia and Hungary joined in a personal union)
- King Petar Svačić (the last Croatian king, killed in battle by the Hungarians)
- Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan (members of the Croatian-Hungarian movement against Austrian centralism and absolutism)
- Nikola Šubić Zrinski (the defender of Sziget against Ottomans)
- Ban Josip Jelačić (leader of the revolution against the Hungarians in the 19th century)
- Ljudevit Gaj (the creator of modern day Croatian grammar, invented our modern latin alphabet by adding the letters š, ž, č, ć, đ and others)
- Stjepan Radić (fighter for equality of Croats in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia)
- Ante Pavelić (leader of the Nazi puppet state during WW2, probably the most infamous one)
And of course:
- Josip Broz Tito (president of Yugoslavia)
- Franjo Tuđman + all presidents of Croatia since 1991

I think another Croatian said it somewhere around here recently: "It's not a start of a turist season until a drunk Brit falls of the balcony"
No, czech are the brits of croatia
They are the ones climbing mountains in flipflops, drifting away on inflateable matresses etc
Nah, it's mostly the Czechs who do that kind of stuff here
Not impressed
Blatant disrespect of other people's customs and culture
The lads do that thing in the UK thinking that dressing up as a woman is some sort of hilarious joke no one ever thought of before
They also love attention when they are drunk so that's why
I guess I understand why people don't like it from a language learner's perspective
It takes some time to learn how things work, and some things by memory because they seemingly have no rules, but I personally love it
It's smooth as fuck, sounds amazing when sung, and as someone who has trouble with learning rules, it was the perfect language to pick up by ear
I like the way you can turn one word type into another and just mash words together to make a new one
Spelling and pronunciation inconsistencies suck, though
The fact you can't know what some word sounds like from how it's written is awful
is really fun to make fun of english as a languge you put on a russian accent or any other one and say the dumbest shit you can think of in english and it instantly becomes 10 times more funnier
Oh boy, wait till you learn about croatian spelling
You gonna love it
For example lets use Bordeaux
You pronounce it bɔːrˈdoʊ so we's just spell it Bordo, no complications, no extra letters, nothing
What you see you read out
I'm using maybe the wrong example since we'd actually spell it Bordeaux because it is a name
Serbs, on the other hand, went a step further and they spell everything, including names, like they pronounce them

For Zagreb, I guess the historical landmark is the cathedral (the cathedral honestly can’t catch a break: it was ruined in 1880 after an earthquake, and this past Sunday one of its spires fell apart after an earthquake)
In my city Valpovo we have a [castle]
In croatian several words for different sized hammers are čekić (chekich) and bat
I wouldn't call 'čekić' particularly strong
Like you have the hard č at the beginning but ending it with a soft ć kinda ruins it
Čekič. Check-itch
Older word is mlat, which means "beat" (mlatiti = to beat)
I think both are hammery enough
čekić [tschekitch]
an old word for it is also mljat [mlyaet]
Northern parts of Croatia use "kladivec" as a word for hammer
Honestly 'vasara' sounds like it'd fit right into our language
I'd feel very cool saying "Idem po vasaru"
There is also the word "kladivec", mostly used in the Northern/central parts of Croatia
Čekić najjača.
in croatian cura means girlfriend and in polish daughter if I'm not mistake čn. or is it cora
Never heard of it ;)
I highly doubt they aren't
In croatian officially it is kćer but kćerka is widely used

Sometimes, but I do not really care
You can't even have the concept
Each letter sounds the same, no matter the word or letter placement
The way our language works is that the way you pronounce each letter of an alphabet is the same when you pronounce it within a word
It would be totally pointless
We might have a generally phonetically consistent language, but many people struggle with ije/je and č/ć, so it's not totally innate to spell some words accurately
This is why i protest to add the letters ģ,ļ and ń to the alphabet so it can truley be 100%
Thats a tehnical distinction it isnt a phonemic one nobody thinks of the n in banka and nikola as diffrent sounds except linguists
it like how russians dont distinguish between č and ć
ч in лучше makes the sound č and in чуть it makes the sound ć but if you look on the wikipedia for russian phonology you wont find č listed as a phoneme and č and ć are wiriten the same way even tho they are tehniclly difrent becuse the diffrence isnt phonemic
thats mostly just the fact that in some dilactes č and ć are becomeing more simmilar and that ije in words is getting pronounced jeː if you speak a dialect were č and ć arent becomeing simmilar and where ije isnt pronounced jeː then its easy
A lot of Croatians don't have these expectations, although a lot of young people do move out
Especially those who don't live in the capital, but come here to study, most of them find jobs and permanently remain here
As for getting married and double standards, greatly depends on the family
A lot of families in Croatia still have fairly "traditional" views, and I think women are expected to settle and get pregnant sooner than men are, but both are expected to do these things before or at around, I believe, 30
"When are you getting married" is a pretty common question lol
I'd use my own examples, but my family is not very family like, so I don't get bothered with such questions either
Zagreb: incomers from Bosnia and Herzegovina
Zagorje: alcoholics
Istria: separatists
Dalmatia: lazy apartment renters
Lika: sheep herders
Slavonia: left to Germany a long time
In Croatia from my perspective (I'm form Zagreb)
&#x200B;
* Zagreb: snobs who think they are better than everyone else
* Split: Croatia's Florida, but with a lot more thugs 'n' drugs
* Zadar: they just don't seem to care
* Dubrovnik: hostile service industry that requires your firstborn for at most a shit burger
* Osijek: the closest thing to a city Slavonija has
&#x200B;
* Slavonija: hardworking people, empty fields, tons of emigration
* Dalmacija: laid back lazy people, but they go from 0-100 really quickly so shit can get intense (see Split)
* Zagorje: drunkards even by the countries standards (and we drink a lot)
* Istra: they're kinda just doing their own thing and nobody seems to care about it
* Lika: there are more dead than alive people there at this point tbh (just the way Nagash likes)
&#x200B;
if i remember any later i'll make sure to edit them in
Don't forget the communists in Istria
Yeah seriously what's up with that
I know a lot of commies from there
Tbh I don't know and I'm from there
I remember seeing a map of Tito busts in Croatia and all of them were in Istria
It's very interesting and exciting actually
Radius of 100km gets me to one neighbouring country, 200km to another three countries, 400km to two more and 600km to two-three more
And it's all so diverse
German/Austrian/Swiss Alps, few central European Slavic countries + Hungary, Italian/French villages, Adriatic sea and its islands in Croatia
so many different cultures, languages, food, history, perspectives
A lot to explore amd everything on just 1-6hrs long drive
But I am also amazed by US size and nature
Each part of the country is (visually) different from another
Take Alaska, Hawaii, Rocky mountain, central plains, Appalachian mountains, cold nort east, wild north western nature, deserts, aligators and swamps on the south
simply amazing
That's so crazy to hear
You can drive straight through Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Finland for more than 12 hours and still be in the same country
The biggest difference in Europe is that you'll pass through a couple of different dialect areas, a completely different climate in the opposite ends of the country and a completely different culture from where you started
I like Wiena
I think Zagreb had potential to become like it however 20 years of systematic neglecting and criminal activites has destroyed the city on top with recent earthquakes
I would take from wiena metro system, keeping their city center buildings in a good shape
Also waste menagment which is here absolute shite
My country lacks so many good things but nature aint one of that
You can just drive randomly anywhere in Croatia and you will hit a national, regional, nature park or something interesting within minutes
If you think those examples are ugly I got news for you, buddy
They look fine compared to communist brutalism
I would call the first one even pretty
I have to disagree
I live in a building from 1983
And part of my neighborhood is olde commie part
Planners invited sociologists to give their opinion
38 years after my part of the hood has plenty of parks, trees, and even space for cars, remember it was built inn1983
The old part has 26 buildings while new part from this capitalist era, has 52 buildings, only one school and one kidnergarten
My part has đmuch bigger school and 6 kindergartens, 4 city owned and 2 private ones
same goes for other parts of the city
If I have to live in a building I will search for commie ones
Sometimes I forget how many russians you have
This looks bad, similar to our older commie buildings but they put trees between them
This guy is quite popular
This video in particular is older part of my neighborhood, english subs are available
Tbh I like Vaike-Oismae
Just asked my sister, she visisted latvia, lithuania and estonia in 3 separate trips and said that indeed some commie blocks look bad
Yes
My city experienced, just recently, a strong earthquake and it damaged a lot of old town because some buildings(Edit: MANY buildings) are a couple hundred years old and they were not build with modern standards
Also, a railway or metro can be a problem to build in centers of old towns because the streets are to small
And also, a lot of buildings are cultural goods and are protected which is, on one hand, good because you cant build modern buildings there and destroy the historic town but on the other hand its bad because you need a lot o permits to renovate them
Yeah all the time
Most people are voting *against* and not *for* a certain party or candidate
I think that's understandable
Hehe, šmigus dingus
I think people using national unifications of Italy and Germany and Francization of minority languages in France as examples of how regional identities would disappear are totally missing the point
These were nation states, who's explicit goal was to unify their people by forcing a common standardized language in schools
Thus the local dialects faded away
Correct me if I'm wrong but a United EU wouldn't be forcing a common pan-European language on everyone
We'd just go on business as usual except the EU institutions would have more powers
Regulations, too many regulations about food and drink
Croatia, Slavonia and Baranja
Before entering EU we baked (Distilled) Rakia in much larger quantities than now, it was made both for personal consumption and sale to those in close proximity to us, and it was something about which you could brag about, now taxes are too high for it, so less and less people do it, you even have to pay taxes even if you only have the necessary equipment and you didn't distill it that year, so most people sold their equipment, while other's that continue to distill it, do so in hiding
Of course there are big companies that create it legally, but most of the time it's too weak and lack flavour, it's not traditional so to say
There was also a scare about making zimnica, which is a tradition where at the end of summer, most of the vegetables are stored in special way in jars with vinegar that are sealed and then they are ready for consumption anytime during winter
Other example, due to outbreak of African swine fever, heavy regulations regarding the slaughter of pigs that is incoming soon with Kolinje in Slavonia, Kolinje is a tradition whereby when winter is coming, we  slaughter pigs, then in traditional kolinje every part of the pig is used and preserved through some way, fat is cooked and stored for further use, we make čvarci, smoke different types of foods, even pigs insides are used, their intestines are cleaned out and then minced meat is filled inside of it with seasonings to prepare for smoking sausages, hooves are cooked and readied as Hladetina for consupmtion during winter and etc
You can read more about it [here] Anyway during the entry of Croatia into EU, there were fears that heavy regulations would be imposed making kolinje no longer doable, since everyone thought that everyone who wanted to slaughter pigs had to have neccessary conditions, which most could not afford to build
It was not done then, but it is being enforced now, and it is heavy, now most will not be doing kolinje this year and will have to resort to buying in stores the neccessary meat and etc
for consumption for the rest of the year, and this is something that was once done in every household but now is more and more dead
Then again we also have Casu Marzu situation in Italy, if you don't know what it is, google it, but basically it's Italian cheese that is outlawed since EU regulations deem it to be unsafe, and that is part of their food culture and was prepared like that for centuries
There are also fear about ''black face'', to explain, here in Croatia we also have Krampus, Krampus here, follows Saint Nicholas and has black face, he has a black face because he is demon with fur covering his face and he enters through chimneys which stains his face black, but most people only do black makeup over their face, it was not created as racist as we were never a big power, but there are fears that this tradition might be banned or at least pushed  out and replaced with something that western countries deem more appropriate, although this might already have happened since I think very few children today even know about this
"As one country, there would be one leader
And that leader would naturally favour certain things closer to their own culture" - no it wouldn't. Look at Balkans- Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and other parts -  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Hungary, Romanian, Czech republic and Slovakia, Ireland and to some degree Denmark, All small countries and leaders are easily influenced by promise of monetary help for support in EU parliament, so they can present it back home in their favor for more votes next election
And its not only people, they use it to promote political party for more votes to keep it on top next election
i cant believe but i agree with you :) EU would have to put a lot of money in some agency to extremely promote culture on local level or else, eventually language and culture will be lost
Its not something that will happen in 20 years but in 200 we will ask our self where did all that people go since then we will have like 200m of Germans, Italians and french and Spanish but no Estonians or Slovakians
Well if black face is not racially motivated, then there is no problem, I don't care if someone is offended even after being thaught that it was not made to be racist but due to depiction of demons

sometimes I do
Wow, that sounds like a really beautiful thing to take part in
Are there any specific places where people congegrate
Im from Croatia and this seems like a fun thing to see this summer
In Croatia it's difficult to point out single city
We have three distinctive regions
Coastal Croatia (Primorje, Dalmatia, Istria) was historically under huge Roman/Venetian/Italian influence and you can say that by architecture in any city
Rijeka and surroundings were later influenced by the Austrians but remained still distinctively coastal cities
There is also significant continental divide between the coast and the inner Croatia, the [Dinaric Alps]
Then we have central and north-western bit, where Croatian capital is
Historically under heavy Austrian influence, architecture and dialect have many resemblance to German language and the way the buildings look
If you put someone from coastal region next to the person from northern Croatia, they would have hard time understanding each other
Then there is east of the country, Slavonija
Many Germans also influenced that part a lot, but add Hungarians to the mix, you can tell it mostly by the food and how the villages are laid out
This is also where "high Croatian" dialect is spoken the most and is official dialect of Croatia
It's written in the way it's said
It's also better than the Serbian standard because we write foreign names like they're originally spelled
Slavic languages are also underrepresented as important languages
(No, Russia indeed does not, and has never existed
It's A CONSPIRACY
Also, I would really like it
QED
Sample: [
Some Belgian guy reading Croatian poorly: [
I mean if you count Croatia + Bosnia + Serbia, 16 million people is reasonably big
Although, of course, only if the Croatian standard is adopted, as it's the best
It's a rational language to learn because there's a fuckton of them and very few of you Danish people and us, and they have a huge influence over Europe that is only going to increase in the coming decades
Also they don't speak any foreign languages
NAMES
Personal and most cities
But there's some different version for a lot of major cities in Europe
And of course, names in other alphabets are transcribed
Roma language
They don't have their country and they live in Europe
Zrakoplov isn't the same as avion
Avion is a type of zrakoplov
How tf do you guys say tjeralica
Nope
For example "kann, cremen, sechs" all of these words have the "k" sound, but three spellings
Also you have way more than 5 vowel sounds
I would say that Italian is even easier than Spanish to pronounce because of the simple fact that it lacks the "th" sound like in "cerveza".
Also clock my flair but Serbo-Croatian is also very easy to learn how to pronounce (but harder to master because of the consonant clusters)
how do you say šišmiš lol
Please google it, because I sincerely hope Holandija isn't the official standard name
You're not joking:
Holandija is utter heresy
They should start calling Serbia "Vojvodina".
But seriously, do you know why
Can you use both in school or is cyrillic mandatory
Say in biology, do you have textbooks and reports in both scripts or is any preferred

Ustashe genocide most probably
Existing
Tbh as far as empires go, Austro-Hungarian one was *relatively* decent
Would rather be under them than under any colonial empire
One of the biggest fuck you is when you attempted to make Hungarian our (Croatian) official language
Any normal, sane person speaking a normal, sane language would flip a table at that moment
I think this is actually a pretty dumb sentiment
No matter how nice you treated Romanians or Serbs and how much language rights you gave them, if given a choice between their mother country and Hungary they'd always choose their mother country
Your mistake was giving them that choice by losing the war
I'd say your politicians randomly deciding to split the USSR was a way worse geopolitical tragedy for Russia than selling Alaska
Related to this, HSS just giving its whole state apparatus to the Ustaše in 1941
Everyone responsible for the genocide that the Yugoslav state could get its hands on was punished
Nothing was forgiven
I’d still say loosing everything Russia has fought for since the 1600s is a bit worse than loosing Alaska though
But yeah the breakup has been even worse for Central Asia, Moldova, Ukraine etc
Only Russia and the Baltics are doing ok
In Split where I'm from lower than 10°C is cold and higher than 28°C is hot, less than 5°C is too cold and higher than 34° is too hot
In Zagreb where I study heat tolerance is pretty similair but the reason why Zagreb has 10 times shittier wheater is colder half of the year
In span of less than two weeks temperature has gone from nice 16° to 8°, even 3° in the morning and late at night and it will not go back up for the next 5 months
At the same time Split has stable 14°-16° weather all day long and coldest months feel the same as autumn in Zagreb
It's probably one of the reasons why I can't see myself living here after finishing my studies
Cold - below 0
Chilly - 0-13ish
Nice - 14-22ish
Warm - 22-30
Hot - 30+

And now when i think about it, consider all values to be an "ish". Always depends on the wind, humidity and all that stuff
We don't really know where the word for our country and people comes from and what does it mean
For instance in English Germany is called so because it was Latin for neighbour or Deutschland meaning land of the people
Theres a lot of theories going around for where the word comes from or what it means but there's a lot of disagreement going on

For old town Zagreb it must be Agrameri-[Ružo Crvena]
The rest is either [Stoka] or good old [Herzegovian Ganga] cuz so many people came from there to Zagreb
Which one
I'm a sucker for medieval Italy
I put Zagreb, Zagreb by Ivo Robić but that is pretty good too
I am giving you our football abilities
Croatia will be the perfect counter balance
People would punctually sip coffee during the work hours
[If my grandmother had wheels she would be a bike]
Not in a million years
I never understood that
Only germans like their bread, it's simply not eaten anywhere else, there are so many other breads that are way better and tastier
Their stray animals are drunk mooses (mees
) so i dont know how that is an improvement
Yeah, I've been with my girlfriend, and it's kinda amusing I guess, but nothing special
I was actually never in the Technical Museum
We pledge we'll go every year, and then somehow end up never going lol
Yeah, I've heard it's amazing
I mean, there's technically the museum night event, but the crowd is always by far the worst at the Technical museum haha
We also eat soup every day here in Croatia
We have that in Croatia
Kinda shocked it's not what everyone has
Probably a Balkan thing
It's also a thing in Croatia
Pretty sure that's not exclusive to germany
And Pepsico introduced Schwip-Schwap
While there's only one version of MezzoMix, there's lemon flavour, sugarfree and sugarfree + caffeine free Schwip-Schwap
Not to mention all the cheap cola + orange versions in Lidl, Aldi etc
Well, we also do that in Croatia
I can confirm you can buy it in Croatia, but only in Müller stores
I can confirm you can buy it in Croatia, but only in Müller stores
In the balkans it’s čorba
Yes, you are responsible for the Terminator
Okay
>but I wonder how meaningful that distinction would be to a Congolese person
That's not the point though
The point is blaming Belgium over something it had no control over
It's like blaming the US over what Trump does in his private property in other countries
Belgium didn't colonize the Congo Free State for fuck sake though
They only took over decades later **specifically to stop the crimes**
>Which is something they could have done much, much earlier
But they choose not to
Wha what
Where do you get this BS from
Do you just make it up along the way
No it was initially not known at all to the wider public what was happening
There were few reports and they were all conflicting
Once what was actually happening became widespread knowledge, the Congo was confiscated from Leopold
Honestly I always thought that Friuli- Venezia Giulia is autonomous because of strong regional Friulian identity not becaue of slovenes . I remember as a kid traveling there quite often so those hills in that region always make me chuckle when I travel trough that region
Thing is if I travel to western country  Italy is always a country that I need to pass, so after being in a state of half hunger after Spain or France Italy is a first stop where I stuff food into myself
In 2019
I was so hungry after a week in Paris so when I landed in Treviso, first ordered pizza then in Venezia ordered cuttlefish spaghetti
In 2013
after visiting both spain and france I was so hungry that  I ordered half a chicken and pasta on some highway bistro, payed like 21€ but was so happy
Nice username
I guess you also have problem with local sheriffs
I had everything planned to visit Milano last year in April but corona and shit and concert was of course post-poned
So if vaccination starts on a larger scale and things come back to some normality
friends and I are planing either Rome, Sicily (because I'm a huge fan of Andrea Camilleri) or Moscow-Sankt-Peterburg
Still can't decide
Rijeka doesn't have sizeable Italian minority but Istria has, so bilingual signs are implemented even if Italians don't make 33% of the municipality
Not you but slovenian muncipalities, guys that have too much power
Nice username was just a statement
If you keep the religions freedom we maybe be cool with it
The Illyrian provinces would be right across the river (since I live in Zagreb)
Otherwise I would be in H. M.
I would live 500 meters north of the french border
Probably make my living as a smuggler
Well, you built roads, bridges and fountains in Dalmatia and you helped publish [the first newspaper in Croatian] (and Italian) which promoted our local language instead of trying to remove it (like other foreign rulers)
Another comment mentioned that one of the main streets in Split, Croatia is named after the French general Auguste de Marmont and for some reason, even though it has declined, a town in Dalmatia called Imotski had a high rate of learning French in school instead of the usual German/Italian which is learned in Croatia because of the French roads that were built there
In Croatian we call them 'knedle' but are predominantly made with plums
They can be served with breadcrumbs like you mentioned, but also with cream
My favourite dessert for sure
Yeah man I love them
Plum ones are the best, apricot is for jam
We call them "marelice", probably from Austrian term "marille"
The entirety of [Dubrovnik]
Croatia is a country full of various foreign influences so its hard to pick one
I would say Zagreb Cathedral, Diocletian's Palace in Split and the Arena in Pula
Probably [St
Mark's Church]
I think the Diocletian's Palace would be the *one*. Sure, we have the Zagreb Cathedral and Arena of Pula, but I don't think anyone would recognize those
Not really a building, but the walls of Dubrovnik are very famous, combined with Dubrovnik as a whole
Also, Walls of Dubrovnik
Mountain bike, because paths here can be shitty, and if you're downtown, cobblestone streets are not comfortable for a bike without suspension
I feel like almost everyone here rides only mountain bikes
I use mountine bike to go to the gym and everywhere else i go
You can block the suspension on the fork so it acts like a city bike
Zagreb is not that flat, so gear shifter and suspension are a must, and a lot of people also like going somewhere with their bikes on the weekends, like climb a mountain or go along the river on a gravel or dirt paths
City bikes are cool for casual rides tho
You'd change your mind driving your bike in Croatia
At least late 8th century - 1102
1991 - today
We had 3 or even 4 if you count Kingdom of SCS Croatia
610 - 1102 (duchy to kingdom until PU with Hungary and later Austria)
1941 - 1945 Independent State of Croatia
1991 - present Modern Republic of Croatia
Croatia was not free during Nazi rule nor do we recognize that abomination
Well it was a country sooo
No, it wasn’t. It wasn’t free, wasn’t recognized, and didn’t even encompass whole Cro as they sold Dalmatia off
It was Nazi abomination that Croats don’t recognize
Read our Constitution
Frankfurt imo
That place just had a feel of emptiness and it didn't even feel like a german city
Just the combination of ugly modern buildings slapped right next to the older stuff just doesn't look good
And honestly the place itself barely felt welcoming, idk how to explain it
Rome as well
God I've never seen a dirtier capital city
Sure it has nice sights,but you literally cannot approach the majority to even see them because of the amount of people
The Vatican Museum was the worst tho - oh you want to see a painting or a sculpture
Well fuck you lol -the crowd literally pushes you and our local tour guide was just hurrying us too
The city centre is pretty nice, but I didnt feel too safe in the other areas of the town
I really like Belgrade and so do most other people here, but it's probably because of the similar culture
I went and it was good dk wtf they are talking about, it was clean and didnt smell bad
I didnt go when it was summer to avoid tourists
I went in April of last year
Assyrians, Akadians, Sumerians etc are done in a single lesson as a sequence of civiliziations in mesopotamia
Then Egypt and Phenycians
Then mostly Greece with short interlude about persians
Then Rome
Then short mention of several germanic tribes, vikings, etc
Its mainly greece and rome
Chinese or Indian or other Asian cultures are barely mentioned, as well as Central/South American - all of them are udually a single paragraph
Can confirm this
They are two completely different letters
I dont know IPA so h is like regular h in english (hurry, hide) or ch in loch ness
A is always pronounced the same, as in a in car, or (first) e in eye, I (without the y fadeout)
As an aside, we realy realy like H (country is named Hrvatska)
So it is common in names and many many abbreviations
I would like to visit them all eventually
Except for Turkey
Erdogan is a brainlet and I don't want to fund his gouvernment
But the rest of the country seems really good but I'm not going in there as long as hes there
Gladly
Oh yeah, I forgot about Orban
Well what interests me about russia is not really russia but the republics
What does that imply though
"Bogu iza nogu" - Behind gods feet
Or "Tunguzija" - Where the tungusic people live (Siberia)
We often say for someplace far in god knows where as Tunguzija which I thought was imaginary but is apparently a real oblast in Russia called the Tunguska oblast
Don't forget "vukojebina" which is translated to "place where wolves fuck".
"That place is far away" = "Ma to ti je tamo negdje u pički materini"
Plitvice lakes, Croatia
Park rangers telling people to exit because the visiting day is over
Japanese woman: "Aha, that's because you turn off the falls now".
She thought it's all artificial
Time for the maintenance of electric pumps
Yeah exactly
I worked in a store in a quite a touristy area and I would much rather have Americans getting our hellos wrong than the Italians or the French who would refuse to speak anything but Italian or French
I am from Croatia and I got a lot of upset French tourists who would get really upset when they realised I couldn't speak French
They would continue to speak French to me nonetheless but with a much more annoyed tone of voice
In effin Croatia was the most annoying part
We have almost no historical connections to that country nor a valid enough reason to be learning French en masse
Imagine that arrogance
Yes it did, I believe it was even labeled as breaking news by a few (those consider everything breaking news) but it was only mentioned on the day that it happened unlike the NZ shooting which is still mentioned
They are quick but they would also write for example: BREAKING NEWS: Ronaldo scores a hattrick
That is not breaking news material, at least not to me
Aren't carabinieri under jurisdiction of both ministry of defence and internal affairs/interior (however you call it)
I have a picture with carabinieri from my trip to Firenza in 2012
I like how your police drive AR 159 <3
Fuck, I'm laughing so hard
Thank you for the origin of aujourd'hui
That always interested me
As someone else pointed out "America" **the continent** had thousands of years of history with empires, religions, literature
While America **the country (USA)** and the territory it covers really didn't.
All the advanced civilizations of the Americas were in Central and South America, not north

Maybe a year younger if you go for vocational 3 year high school and now want to go to uni anyway
8 primary (mandatory) + 4 or 3 years of highschool
And you start age 6/7
The story (one of them, but the most popular) how my hometown, Zagreb, got it's name goes something like this
"A military commander who was passing through, exhausted and dehydrated, stopped at one point and dug his sword in the dry, cracked ground, out of despair, and water suddenly began gushing out of it
There was a girl by the name of Manda ( short for Magdalena, probably)
And the commander told her: "Mando, dušo, **_zagrabi_** vode" (Manda, sweetheart, grab me some water)
And that led to a town that soon developed there
So basically my hometown got it's name from the verb "zagrabi" which translates to grab
And if you've visited Zagreb, on the center square/plaza
You can see the well called "Manduševac", which got it's name from the girl (Manda) in the story, and from where the legend started
There is also the story (quite possibly the truth), how people called the town as "the town behind the hill" (Due to Zagreb being behind/next to the hill/mountain Medvednica)
Which translates to Croatian as (Grad i**za breg**/a)
Which through time ultimately lead to it's distorted name (Grad Zagreb)
( **iza brega** - **'za breg'** - **zagreb**)
It means River
Self explanatory since its on the mouth of the biggest river around the area
That's quite interesting
In Croatian "trg" = "square" and "market place" is quite similar too: "tržnica".
Never thought a name of a Finnish city would come from a Slavic word
I always liked the story about Manda and the commander, I know it’s probably just a myth but it sounds cool
I’ve never heard of the second theory though, and I’ve lived in Zagreb my whole life
Huh, I guess you do learn something new every day
Na vrh brda vrba mrda :)
The word "Prede" for it is the same in croatian
Hey, as someone who wants to study linguistics in France, what are the best universities for it ? Specifically, Computational linguistics
Merci d'avance
Hello my Slavic brother, as far as South Slavic nations go we don't have many creatures tied to water, we mostly have creatures tied to forest like Vile(benign fairies), the undead creatures such as vampires, young children spirits that died and cursed beings such as Vukodlak basically a werewolf but one created from curse that stems from killing a wolf (greatest sin in Slavic mythology)
there are some creatures from Slavic mythology listed [here]
>Waldemar Białecki's cancer treatment expenses would be mostly covered by insurance,
Good for Poland
Everyone that I’ve had ties with that got diagnosed with cancer in Croatia was told, “You’ve had a good, long enough life, so no point in trying to treat you
Go home and die peacefully and know that we’ll just use the money that we’re saving by not treating you on someone younger with another disease
Good bye
”  Kind of sucks to not at least try to make even a small effort to fight the cancer
We tend to speak standard in situations where you are unsure about other person or in official, formal situations
People usually wouldn't even try dialect with foreigners (on purpose)
It is mostly used in close settinhs, on green market etc
oh yeah, in formal settings especially i ditch my dialectal speech
my accent is still very recognizable, but not as much as it usually is, lol
If you are talking about NW then yes, we all switch to standard
The south on the other hand, not so much
And I don't think they'd be happy if you asked them to speak standard

I didnt feel like mentioning it since he's already bombarded by everyone else
Glava, ramena, koljena i stopala (X2)
Oči, uši, usta i nos
Glava, ramena, koljena i stopala
Translation:
Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes (X2)
Eyes, Mouth, Ears and Nose
Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes
Stopala aren’t toes, they are feet
I have never heard this song in croatian as well
Oh, yea, you are right
Historically: Ante Pavelić - both incompetent and piece of shit human being
More modern: Ivo Sanader - your usual corrupt politician
This is actually very interesting as we in Croatia when we were studying history we were told that Oliver Cromwell was actually a good figure because he brought back parliamentary monarchism and stopped the absolute monarch Charles I. This might be due to the fact that we learn a very small part of English history
Happy cake day
Franjo at least suceeded in most of his endevours so I would say he was competent even if you disagree with his actions
At least Benedict Arnold's treachery was him flipping a bird at the people that fucked him over
Quisling was just a pro-Nazi fascist
We sometimes use diamond instead of rock because it goes better with paper and scissors though maybe that is just me and my town I know other places just use rock
I've always heard only "rock, paper, scissors" (kamen, papir, škare), "diamond" would be to long to say
Huh, I've never thought about how you guys say it
It's "kamen, škare, papir" in Croatian
It would go like: Pa-pir-Ška-re-Di-ja-mant
So you go like:one-two one-two one-two shoot, "mant" being the verse where we shoot
Kamen, škare papir goes: Pa-pir-Ška-re-Kamen in a rythm like : one-two one-two shoot, "kamen" being the word where you shoot
For me personally I don't care, papir, kamen, skare is shorter but kamen is too long for the shooting and papir, skare, dijamant is maybe too long
It's the same rhythm as in the English "Rock, paper, scissors" whereas we show the gesture on the "pa" part of "papir".
This sounds oddly, soul-crushingly familiar
highly depends on if i'm going to the store high or sober
That one day we'll be as prosperous as Switzerland
our prime minister of that time welcoming tourists:
she was in hungary the day after yesterday :/
the same prime minister talking about european bank:

Trump is an idiot
And the irony of Erdogan, a crypto-fascist calling the Netherlands one of the most liberal countries on earth "Nazis" went past all the heads of his supporters
Yes, when other countries start migrating to Mars we might reach the development index Switzerland had in 2019 haha
You've basically described Croatia and our diaspora
There are some of us Redditors 50+ with the first-hand experience with socialism in Yugoslavia
Coca-cola, jeans, rock music, records from the west republished same day, TV shows, a possibility for travel, foreign goods, on the other side excellent health care, education, vacations in the state-owned or company-owned facilities, socializing and friendship
Efficient use of public money, investments, production, perspective
Absence of nationalism and religion in public life, a secular republic and equality before the law
That was not so good, so we decided to tear it all down, install nationalistic pro-nazi oligarchies of greedy imbeciles, install idiotic priests that preach hatred and crime, introduce corruption, theft, hatred, and greed as the highest virtues on all levels, bring back all the ghosts of the past that we had once defeated and giggle in that sewer of pride with our "democracy" and "capitalism" and especially the new-found "freedom". Since we are never happy with our achievements, now we move away and emigrate in large numbers from that pot of shit
To be honest, not all was great but as any time it had it's pros and cons and I find it silly to generalise
The biggest setback we had was the wars in the 90's. Even if we didn't want to be in a state together, we could have peacefully split apart
If anybody is interested in the comparison of live before and now
I recommend watching Goran Milić's documentary series Tada i Sada:Hrvatska, BiH i Srbija
Not just travel, it was the best passport in the world at that time, it gave you access to both west and east, i dont know if any country had that
Or, in Djole's words "crveni pasos bez mane sto prolazi grane bez puno njakanja".
I wouldnt say it was better back then because a) i was born in '85 so i dont have a lot of XP on that matter, b) we have more opportunities now for sure
But the thing is everyone had something back then and now a lot of people dont have anything while few have too much
Nope
Hunt for "srbocetniks" and "ustasa" is a neverending task that keeps on the fog while they are stealing, pillaging and robbing
It was a limited market, but unlike the so-called Eastern Bloc, it was a market
For example, in Yugoslavia existed the companies that produced the same product that would compete
Even foreign, license made products
In the beginning, there were five-year plans and planned production, but it was abandoned in the sixties
There was even a movement of the workforce, you could go and work in any other part of the federation
But companies were - since 1950 - created as a worker co-ops where a manager had to manage along with the worker's councils
Those ideas you could find among so-called Western Marxists and some anarchists
Workers participation
There was even a private sector
You could have a private company with up to 10 workers
It was not only reserved for services but also existed in production
So, the word private was not only applied to personal property, but you had some privately owned sector in the economy
Yugoslavia had a large and developed production out of the classical socialism heavy industry
The industry of consumer goods and those goods had to fight on the market, for the client
Therefore we had marketing
One thing more was the foreign policy, the namely non-aligned movement, which opened a big window for the companies to go on the world market and compete for the projects
Large ones
Yugoslav companies worked in may non-aligned countries of Africa and Asia earning hard currency and thus making that type of socialism possible
Our workers could work abroad for a better salary using that system, or simply going to work in West Europe
Travelling abroad was a norm for anyone, every citizen
All those benefits and advantages melted in the wars of the nineties
All our economic advantage was erased, and we were even reduced back to the seventies
For example, average purchasing individual power in Croatia today is even worse than in 1978
And the pace of the development, except maybe that of Slovenia, is modest and insufficient
Croatia, as a second economy of the former Yugoslavia, is by most of the parametres today worse than Romania or Bulgaria
It is last in the EU
Yes, tourism keeps our head above the water, but the country is de-industrialized and literally has no perspective
Emigration, especially among young people, is high
25 % of Croats today live abroad
In Bosnia is even worse, with some 45 %. The difference, an important one, with the emigration in the times of Yugoslavia, is that today people go not to return
In the old times, they would work, mostly in Germany, but would build their family house in Yugoslavia
Today, they pack their family with them and simply go
There are not many sources online in foreign languages about this sad story
Politically, it is not wise to label yourself as yugo-nostalgic
Then they label you as a Stalinist communist
Which is totally absurd
Even our current president is publicly crying how Yugoslavia was "behind the Iron curtain" and that communism was endless darkness while in reality as a teenager she went to high school in the USA
Right-wing political agenda is to persuade us how the era of socialism and Yugoslavia was horrible, literally concentration camp and how they brought the light of capitalism and ended that inhumane system
Truth is just the opposite
Illustration: only ONE company from my town produced 3,5 million pairs of shoes for the Russian market
A year
At the same time making Adidas for the German market
It had 1200 workers
Today there is a commercial center Lidl with 15 employees - on the same spot
We had DOZENS of companies like that in my town
My town in Croatia turned from successful industrial one into the darkness-after-7-in-the-evening town
Unemployment 30 %. Drunks everywhere

Two meanings: either something is generally very unlikely to happen, or it is used in the context that an evil person does not go against another bad guy, in other words, criminals help each other
Ja u kupe ti u špade
Means sth like "we're playing different card suits" - "we can't come to an agreement/we're talking about different things", it refers to the card games tresette and briscola
Sit gladnom ne vjeruje
"The sated man does not believe the starving one" Denying the severity of the troubles of those less fortunate than us

"Ko pod drugim jamu kopa, sam u nju upada" is my personal favourite
Literally translated it means "He who digs a hole beneath someone falls in it himself" Basicallydon't sabotage others
Got a mild stream of air through my nose
Yep, it is a joke for some times now
In ex yu countries and Bulgaria i think i would be fine
Serbia, bosnia, montenegro and (in lesser extent) slovenia would be fine
I also speak a bit of italian and german so i guess i could communicate with people who speak those languages
When i think about it i believe czech and slovak would work too because when i was a kid growing up in a popular tourist place i met a lot of czech people (we were chasing girls a lot back in the days) and we could communicate with each other without using english
I learned a lot of czech words that way as well
Unless broken german is good it isnt gonna do me much good

22° or so
Under 20 kinda sucks, and this is by far my least favourite season
Now I'm really curious: how do you survive without heating
Do you at least use electric heaters
Do you freeze to death when you get out of a shower
I really didn't know that the climate is so mild there, so it makes more sense now
I always thought it'd be much colder than here
Why aren't you in Customs Union atleast
Meanwhile, UK is trying to become new Norway/Switzerland
That is alright, I guess
But what about tariffs for other EU states on your own stuff
Like what if I wanted to buy a jacket from Norway
Since the salaries up there are HUGE, I guess the price wouldn't be low
Lets say some $800
With tariffs is $1100
No good
It is good to support national brands, though
Atleast Boris could open borders to us, he comes to our country every year almost
There is word that got extremely popular in last decade
It's the word *uhljeb*, first time used on an [ultras transparent] in a football game back in 2008
It denotes a person with parasitic tendencies, most commonly associated with bureaucracy, nepotism, pen pushers in public system and people who get everything in life by brandishing party membership card
Nowadays you can see it in almost any social media post and articles criticising government or system in general
*Here is an article in english ["Uhljeb – a post-socialist homo croaticus: a personification of the economy of favours in Croatia
"] by Ružica Šimić Banović discussing the context
Susramlje, basically the same thing
Capital Zagreb, i can walk alone as a female almost everywhere in my city(maybe one neighbourhood is tricky but still i dont think i would be attacked)
The same goes for the rest of the country
I am more afraid od stray dogs or wild animals than people
Croatia (100k ish people)
I would say its pretty safe
I walked home alone at night many times and never had problems
Street attacks/muggings are very rare
I would say that applies to the country in general because I had no bad experiences in the capital either
Although there are a few locations in my city (such as an abandoned factory complex or illegal shacks city) where i wouldnt consider myself safe or comfortable at night
I live in an average sized town called Varaždin (45k people)
Going outside and getting robbed is very hard, but it does happen sometimes
Places with less than 100 thousand people are pretty safe, but i’m not sure what it’s like for large cities like Zagreb (800k people) or Rijeka (130k people)
Are you talking about Kozari Bok
I remember in 2008 being drunk in the middle of vienna and singing "osterreich, osterreich, alles ist vorbei" after we won that football game
Not even a dirty look
Yes I am :)
In Croatia we have tambura/tamburitza and some other old primitive traditional instruments like bagpipes and more primitive tamburas - [example for all of it] Tambura bands have 5-8 members but there are also orchestras and folklore organizations who take care of preserving and promoting this kind of music and art
Vinkovci: the Habsburgs built us a Gymnasium in the 18th century, now it's the most elite school in our area
Harboring hungarian king Bela IV during Mongolian invasions and obtaining Golden Bull for it, establishing it as a Free royal city in 1242
With the bull the city was exempt from standard feudal practices and prospered as small center of merchants and craftsmen

(Hopefully, I to wrote the Hungarian name correctly)
No, Samobor
A few other cities were granted Golden Bulls at the time aswell
That was uncalled for
He was discussing historical perspective, not current state
I know
But we're turning into a prejudiced society acting like that
Croatian has many similiar to Polish

• list - leaf
• a - but
• gore - up/mountains
• more - sea
• rat - war

Not many Europeans know exactly how to act in every other part of Europe
It's not a problem
You just observe how local people act and try to fit in, or at least not annoy people
khem, English people, khem
I know, I live in the UK
The reason why you do not bother to try though is this English exceptionalism and the fact that you have never got off your high imperialist horse
You lot always blame it on alcohol whenever I try and speak to you about it, but in reality its the arrogance and thinking that you are better than the continent
Ask any Croatian during the tourist season
Half three like 2:30
Because we say it like that in croatia as well
What else could it be
What
It is literally one of the most common arguments between dalmatians (2 ipo) and northerners (pola 3)
Also tri manje kvarat vs petanest do tri (3 minus quarter vs fifteen until 3)
I have been late a couple of times because my brain interprets "pola 3" as just "half + three". Also the whole "frtalj" thing which I still don't really get
Yep, I usually skip breakfast or eat something from a bakery around 10 or 11
Lunch is the largest and most important meal of the day while dinner is just leftovers/a sandwich/salad/pancakes/eggs etc
Unless it is a special occasion, like eating at a real restaurant for some reason, weddings, birthdays, Christmas eve etc
While most people don't skip breakfast, the rest is the norm in the Balkans at least AFAIK
that's right
we have "3 i po" (3 and a half, "po" shortened from pola, meaning half) and pola 3 meaning half 3
one is 3:30, the other is 2:30
Oh, I even heard that countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are communist
To me that sounds like it's trying to say that it's a stark contrast to be black in Sweden as Swedes are amongst the palest people on the planet
I start with socialist bailouts
Turns peaceful people into a raging inferno
They adore their rich corporations and money-hoarding psychopaths
What
I have never paid to take a piss here in my life
What kind of places were you at
Just go into the nearest coffee shop (disclaimer: you cant be more than 500 meters from one) and politely ask to use the toilet
I can buy 30-35 square meter apartment, hopefully there will be some leftover for taxes, stamps and fees
North-East Munich, Germany
Prices are normally 8-10000K euros per square meter
No wonder it was declared as a biggest property bubble in the world
In my hometown (Zagreb, Croatia) I could buy 3 cozy apartments, or two houses, or 2 normal apartments + 1 cozy house
Took a look and i found for 368k i can buy a mansion with pool and wellnes that is  396 square meters
With that kind of money you can buy a 300-400 m2 house or at least 2 flats (80-100 m2)in 99% of locations in my town and surrounding area (urbanized centre and countryside with cca 200k people) with enough leftover money for a nice car
You might get some modern newly built mansions at the sea side with pool and other ammenities
That is serious level money there
And for most of the country (excluding strict centre of capital or posh touristy/historic locations) it gets you at least that and probably more
In many rural parts you can get a house with sizeable lot of arable land for less than 50-100k €.
What bezirk is that
I have a cousin in 9th and an uncle in 19th, the latter one looks pretty cool for living
I was browsing immoscout few days ago for an apartment in my area/street and all I found was 670,000-700,000 euros for 62-67 sqm, wtf
Wait, those huge buildings next to the river
I was there in 2019 and the neighbourhood was still being built but it looked pretty good and fancy
No, no, give me your address so i can come and visit you the next weekend
He was an architect, now retired so yeah, he's living the life
I really love vienna, it would totally be a city i could live in if it was closer to the sea
Smart
You never know who might read it on the internet
Not everyone is a good person like i am
In Croatian, shark is morski pas, literally sea dog
Uff, you do not want to go down that road
He just holds the latest patent, first records show it was  [Leonardo da Vinci] and after that second was Faust Vrancic (Fausto Veranzio) from Sibenik, then Venetian republic
And Stefan uses something similar to parachute, so
so true
Ive seen people do that
I dont talk to them
Im afraid to
Pros: beautiful nature and architecture, safe, low crime rate, food, clean water, free education and healthcare
Cons: very high corruption rate and low wages both of which led to brain drain, conservative, overly complicated administration, slow and unreliable public transport (especially trains)
I love two Serbian patriotic songs from World War 1, despite the fact that Croats fought on the opposing Habsburg side
[Marš na Drinu, (March on Drina)] - Very inspiring, the lyrics are especially sharp and fun, really motivates you to go and fight for your fatherland
It was created in commemoration of the 1914 battle of Cer, where the Serbian army beat Austria-Hungary
[Tamo Daleko, (Far, far away)] - Very emotional, detailing the nostalgia for their occupied fatherland of the Serbian army-in-exile on Corfu
I like how they're patriotic without explicitly attacking or diminishing the enemy
They're the complete opposite of the most popular type of war songs from the 90s where the enemy was brutally humiliated in songs, on a ridiculous level
What was your people's most famous disaster (as in earthquakes, explosions, nuclear leaks)
For Croatia(these hit Serbia and Bosnia more) the 2014 floods were ravaging for the southern Slavonia region which was completely flooded
Villages and towns were destroyed along with people, livestock and other living things whom died in the catastrophe
Apparently a few people killed themselves in despair for their homes and loved ones
Other disaster is the Dubrovnik earthquake in the  16th century maybe, which as earthquakes do destroyed a bunch of stuff and killed some people
this is a link to the most serious disasters in Croatia by death toll if someone wants to read
They are not natural but still interesting
Currently Zagreb is still recovering from an earthquake and a flood which came last week I think
The old town is in desperate condition and "thankfully" "only" one person died
Oh yeah, I saw that
Since you are our neighbours
How many people did get hurt
I meant a disaster that was directly related to your people
Doesn't have to happen in your country
you forgot to mention a draft
It's the biggest killer and  an enemy of all balkanites that have ever lived
let's not forget wet hair even if it's 30 degrees outside
nah, if anything it's universal I'd dare to say across europe
I wouldn't wonder if someone on Canary islands also won't come out on 35 degrees temp
I knew it, look at my comment down below where I mentioned canary islands
We have similar for a face but without a wind
If you close your brows like you are angry or have sun in your eyes you will be stuck with that expression/face
you asked for it, baba milka was internet star
Folders
We just had notebooks
I'd either get something that went with the theme of the subject or whatever else I thought looked cute
For Croatia it would be the easternmost region, Slavonia
Its people are known by their extreme hospitality, great food and hardwork
Since it is kinda poorer than the rest of the coutry it also gets a lot of simpathy and empathy by the rest of the country
What about Bremen
I've heard a lot of germans hating on bavaria, saying they're religious nuts and hillbillies
I even heard the comparison that bavaria is germany's texas
Was wondering when i'll find one croat here because i dont think we have a town/city/region everyone likes
Regarding slavonia, i'm not sure about the rest of croatia but istrians arent big fans od them
There's a bunch of them who came to pula, looking for a better life i guess, and people dont like their backwards mentality usually
They're pretty
how should i put it
simple, traditional and primitive
I mean if i'd have to make a list of regions and people slavonia would be somewhere near the bottom
Girls probably
I've never been there but people say that girls from Novi Sad are something else
And i think there's more of them than men, a lot more but i'm not sure if that's correct
Can you give me some reasons
I'll be moving to Bremen in a few days and would greatly benefit from this information
Thanks, I will be in Walle and I've already been warned of that place hahaha
English all the way
Helped by the fact I'm working with people from all over the globe, so, um, yeah, it would be kinda hard for them to understand what the writer wanted to convey if everything was in Croatian
It’s considered budget with mediocre quality
People shop there but mostly buy brand names and local products
Not a lot of their products except for snacks which are very good imo
There is an insult sort of common in middle school where bullies call poor pupils “Lidlić” (meaning little Lidl) for wearing clothes from Lidl
I dislike going there because I never seem to find what I’m looking for
A basic food like cooking cream
I looked for that fucker for 10 minutes and still couldn’t find it, said fuck it and went to an another supermarket
Here in Croatia its one of the better ones
I always put Lidl, Aldi and Norma in the same group because they offer similar products and have similar prices
The other one would consist of Netto and Penny and then you have Edeka, Rewe, Hit, Kaufland, V-Markt and Real with best offer
This goes for Bavaria, I don't know what other shops are popular in other parts of Germany
Sretan rodendan(kinda),(If you understood what I said)
I guess they're just regional
Many products in Lidl and Aldi are basically the same (they just have different names) and so are the prices
All in all, it's very similar
Depends on who
If it’s a friend, you just say “Halo” (Hello) If it’s someone from a professional environment you say “Dobar dan” (Good day) If it’s a stranger, you say “Dobar dan, tko ste vi
” (Good day, who are you
"Halo"
"Dobar dan
Or: "Jebemu boga, po sedamdeseti put danas, baba, ovo NIJE stan Ivančić, ja NE ZNAM gospodina Ivančića ni njegovu ženu, doviđenja"
While "slušam" has the same meaning in Croatian, if you use it when answering the phone the meaning would be more like "ok, what did you mess/fuck up now
" :)
Gotta admit, it kinda does
Like, after da I'd half expect "koj kurac hoces
" XD
I also just go with halo
Croats arrived to the Balkans in the 7th century, but it is unknown when it was founded
The first Croatian dukes start appearing in the 9th century
There were some earlier rulers who might have had the title
Croatia became a kingdom in the 10th century and the crown switched between different dynasties with varying degrees of autonomy
Croatian republic was established inside Socialist Yugoslavia during WW2 and it became independent in 1991
Constantine VII wrote in his De Administrando Imperio that we came to today’s Croatia around 626
During a rule of Duke Branimir, on 7th June 879, Duchy of Croatia was officially recognized as a state by Pope John VIII
Kingdom was established in 925 by our first king Tomislav
Well we arrived here and established 2 duchies in 7th century but after 1102 we had a shit ton of foreign leaders up until 25 June 1991 when we became independent
925 was the year when the first kingdom of Croatia appeared with the crowning of the king Tomislav
We are not sure if Tomislav was ever crowned as king, but he was for sure recognised as one
I've already seen it, but thank you
It is fine for a short summary
Probably because unlike Croatia or Slovakia it mostly wasn't part of any Hungarian state
Only the northeastern Prekmurje region, I believe, and that's really small
In Croatia, there’s always a friend in some rural town with a tractor willing to help you out
Other than that, you use a car to awkwardly move it
i was in a similar situation few weeks back when i needed to transport two 2
5 metres tables to my workshop
often there's someone you know who has a van which helps when you need to bring shit from ikea but this time the tables were too big for that van so i rented one
there's an option for 2 hours rental (or 4
) for 200 kn, which is like 25 eur so i did just that
i don't know man, drywall isn't that reliable as well
i hanged more than few paintings with just a nail in a brick wall and if a painting is too heavy for that chances are it will be too heavy for the drywall as well so you'll have to use your dubel on both
Well, most houses are built with reinforced concrete in various parts of the house for structural safety as a measure against earthquakes, and well we don't have tornadoes or hurricanes and etc
i was always wondering why people in tornado alley don't build stronger houses
i mean, it's called "tornado alley" ffs, you know it's gonna hit
so why not just use reinforced concrete then and be done with it
sure, you'll probably need to patch the roof and few windows but the house would be standing, right
there must be a better way other than building your house from scratch after every season
but i'm guessing the tornados which completely destroy houses aren't that common otherwise people wouldn't live there
sure it's cheaper if you compare the prices, but what if you put in the account all the stuff that's in the house and also the psychological toll a destroyed house brings with it, homelessness and shit
i don't know man, i'd rather pay more for a sturdy house so i don't have to worry about it
Daj kako se to zove na nasem
Guglao sam sta je, za pocetak, al sad se ne mogu sjetit kako mi to zovemo
Ja to nikad nisam ni vidio ni radio na tome
Hmm, nije strug, ja mislim na nesto drugo
For the people who are against it, how do you feel about famous athletes getting the citizenship
We had few examples in croatia because our government is so happy when they need to give our citizenship to people like eduardo da silva and sammir (both brazilians, both played football for our NT and both speak very broken croatian)
I dont know, it doesnt bother me tbh, there can be a bunch of reasons why someone would want a citizenship like political prosecution or war, in cases like that i wouldnt mind if they cant speak the language yet, they'll learn it
They don't demand Spanish citizenship though
They're EU citizens living in the EU (for now hehe)
Me too
I'm not an art student but I thought I'd chip in as a computing one since we got a similar thing about creating software
In my university (in Scotland undergrad) the code/programs we write belong to the student not the university, although we don't really need to pay for supplies the university does supply us with some of the fancier pay for programs
I know a lot of people do pay for graphics here and there for their programs, such as when we had a game module, but at the end we retain rights of our code and art assets aren't graded so I don't see a huge issue about it
A lot of people plan to publish their nicer code or working on it after our courses and make something of it so it's really cool
Edit: some minor issues, formatting
Yeah undergrad sorry for not specifying
We always greet each other and sometimes chat for a bit, it really depends on individual people's personalities
Some people will chat you up every time they see you, it's also not uncommon for neighbors to befriend each other and hang out in front of the building almost every day, sometimes they eat and drink too (though that's mostly men, women will sometimes join in or just invite each other over for coffee)
15 minutes walk, 10 minutes tram ride
I work in a larger city but live 40km away in a smaller one - it takes me about 25 minutes by car
It can take much longer during summer though since we have a lot of tourists here
I do have the option of going by bus but it takes way longer (45 minutes between cities and then catching the local bus to the other side of the city - I'm guessing it would take me about 90 minutes, if not even longer)
i like how scandinavian names sound
Stuff like Milorad and stojadin
That's foreign right
> I went as far away as possible as soon as I could
Flair checks out
Either way, welcome to Europe :)
In 1660s Croatian’ soldiers (mercs) went to fight for France
When they arrived in Paris in their full uniform, French fell in love
"In 1660 a regiment of Croats arrived in France — a part of their singular costume excited the greatest admiration, and was immediately and generally imitated; this was a tour de cou , made (for the private soldiers) of common lace, and of muslin or silk for the officers ; the ends were arranged en rosette , or ornamented with a button or tuft, which hung gracefully on the breast
This new arrangement, which confined the throat but very slightly, was at first termed a Croat, since corrupted to Cravat
[A tie
It's kinda ironic, everything that you consider bad is at leat 10 times worse in Balkan's, so even these thing that are bad to you, seem like utopia for us, just yesterday I talked with a friend how our bureaucreacy is slow compared to German, and also recently there was a talk how in Germany you can start in low wage job, but if you show that you can work and are willing to work you can easily get a raise or even go upwards in jobs, while here where you start, you'll most likely stay, and only chance of your minimal wage rising is if goverment increases minimal wage, something which happens rarely and only in very small incremental values
It's almost as if they are a problem in Europe
Sure my reddit kid, because I totally proposed the same solution
We literally had that queston in our version of The Chase (tv quiz) yesterday
Something like, if you're watching Croatian national tv on New Year's day, first you'll be in Vienna and later
and the answer was Garmisch
I personally didn't watch it today but I love the tradition
That everyone wanted to be a footballer and is good at it
We have it in Croatia and we recycle up to 95% of all bottles because of it
A lot of homeless/poor people make a living out of collection bottles on the street
Happened to me last week when I went to a job interview in Hamburg
The Germans were pretty surprised the only thing we mix is "gemischt" and that sparkling water with apple juice is actually pretty bad
What
That's inhumane
Yes, we have Christmas beer, but mulled wine is far more popular in the festive season
Pretty Common in villages and smaller towns in Croatia
Yes, it is
I don't cut my wood but my relatives do it for me and money
Why poor
Some people just want to save some money ;-)
We learned mostly about how some noble Croatians (mostly ban Jelacic) fought and won the Hungarian uprising and then a bit how the German language was pushed onto us while a couple of politicians fought for Croatian language
It was a long time ago but i'd say it was mostly neutral
I liked Austro Hungarian empire myself, i think it was pretty cool
Correct me if i'm wrong but serbia was never an empire, you were a kingdom, right
For a few years they really were an empire (a decade or so)
The lands they ruled reached from Serbia (no Vojvodina then) to southwards
Croatia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, parts of Greece - Thrace, Attica, Peloponese and Agean weren't under their control
So roughly, they controlled half of Balkans at the time
Fucking ottomans
Ruining plans since 1300s.
Toyko, Nagasaki, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Sapporo, Niigata, Fukuoka, Saga, Mutsu, Sendai, Kobe, Kure, Yokosuka, Kochi, Yura, Kaga, Katori, Kashima, Ise, Kirishima, Sasebo (Happy 130 years
) and Onomichi
The first third is common knowledge, all other is thanks to KanColle and various naval research and events
I could name more rivers and peaks than cities though heh
edit - Also small islands
Onomichi is a city I remember from Kamichu
Looks like an interesting city with it being half on an island
I can't say I've seen many documentaries \*presented\* here, they are mostly \*narrated\*. The most well-known documentary narrators here are Drago Celizić and Miljenko Kokot
However, the household name for documentaries in Croatia is Đelo Hadžiselimović. Whenever you see or hear "Odabrao: Đelo Hadžiselimović", you know that is (going to be) a good show
Knowing of [Oliver Mlakar] in Croatia is a question of basic general knowledge
Don't forget how Bandić handled the terrible earthquake that struck Zagreb this march
He spent a large part of the funds previously reserved for disasters into funding churches in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Because he lacked money for repairs, he took away Easter holiday salaries from city-owned companies and kindergardens and transfered them to the disaster fund without informing them
Most of the taken money was used for repairing buildings of his loyalists and administration
And even if he actually bought repairs for the city, the spending was very mismanaged and insufficient for many people
We have that
But its just called "tost" (toast)
Well, as of now, we became the top destinations for earthquakes
Recently we had a third big one this year
Again and again, Ante Pavelić.
Ante Pavelić , fascist leader of the independent state of Croatia ,lead the Ustaše
Pretty much all teachers in the country are striking
Starting today every school is on strike and canceled untill the goverment raises the teachers' salaries
There is one every two weeks, hard to keep track of them all
Debt to IMF
Ethno nationalism
Ex-Yu music is great
Especially Odbrana i Poslednji dana by Idoli (Defense and Last Days)
But what the fuck happened with modern music
Those things basically promote drug abuse
hoho, Mlinar in Zagreb is making burek with orange and its fucking amazing
Spot on
What about massive percentage of kids smoking at age 14 and drinking at 12
Best part of our culture
Men
Women, children, local stray cats and dogs, a confused tourist, everyone
I don't eat bread
But my grandma wants me to eat too much food, that's true
When she sees an empty plate, she asks me 3 times do I want more
In what way have you experienced Balkan hospitality if I may ask
Considering the wars that have made this area quite popular, I am also quite scared of army drafts as well lol
Is slovenian really the least similar
I think i'd communicate easier with a slovenian than a macedonian but it also varies from region to region
I think that a croatian from zagorje would have less problems understanding you than a croatian from dubrovnik, lets say
Oh, so that means that alexander the great was a slav too
Neat
Aleksa Veliki
Oh, let me tell you, Slovenia is pretty big in both the inferiority and superiority complex
It's still the best one of us though
Who dislikes turks
It's not 19th century anymore and, if anything, i'm really grateful for kebabs
I've never heard someone hating turks over here
It's surprising we don't like Turks with the amount of Turkish tv shows we have
Lol, wtf, who likes guns and weapons
I feel like it's mainly serbian criminal culture, it goes hand in hand with serbian turbo folk
German cars as well
I feel like you're describing the most primitive people, creme de la creme of every turbo folk club in the region
Normal people are not like that nor do the listen to turbo folk
If we want to provoke/tease Bosnians, we start talking about burek with apples/cherries :) Coup de grace is "burek with potatoes". :P
Disagree
Can confirm
People think I am not normal if I don't eat bread
I've never met anyone in my life who eats bread with pasta
It's just wrong to do that
Horrible
I eat bread with something i can dip it in (goulash, sarma, punjene paprike) and thats it
Eastern European countries are much much much older than the US
In fact, one of the first countries in the world to officially recognise the independence of America was a then city-state of Dubrovnik
Kajkavian dialect in Croatia is a nightmare to understand for me as someone from dalmatia
Language is just a dialect with an army
The same can be said for scandinavian countries, they also all understand each other
At least we have a different alphabet, if nothing else
Čoko burek masterrace
Lol, so you're calling cabbage "zelje" as well
I got really confused when i came to zagreb to study, i ordered "zelje" salad thinking i'd get the green salad but got cabbage instead
Oof
That's an interesting story
Ceca has her own problems
Even Arkan didn't hate Croats as much (some sources even saying he helped Croats in the war), despite the Maksimir stadium riot in 1990
But that is an another story
Now, pushing crappy music is never a good idea
Most of Serbian scene are males looking like the biggest hillbillies seen, or females that have so much silicones and botox in themselves and sing crappy songs
Unfortunately, such music has changed our society (of all the ex-Yu states) for the worse
It evolved to something even worse
While turbofolk is hillbilly music, it is step above this modern whatever things
No talents, vocals more annoying than a fly or mosquito, drug promotive songs etc
Croatian music may be old-fashioned
But it atleast is music, not whatever this is today
Unfortunately, night clubs are also pushing cajke even here in Croatia
And it sucks
I can give some respect to Mile Kitić, but not to Relja Popović or Rasta for example
I think it only got more popular during socialism tbh
You betray your kind
Well, obviously
I'm talking about standard slovenian vs standard macedonian
Hell, i don't understand a lot when i'm talking to croats from zagorje or even dalmatia
While i'm guessing people from slavonija or even zagreb wouldnt understand a word of proper istrian dialect
i'm talking about croatia, not serbia
sure, there's a bunch of illegal war leftovers but i'm talking about regular citizens, not criminals or ptsd veterans
i see a lot of things wrong with gun culture, i don't like it and i prefer not to turn into another usa where every other guy has a gun around his waist
Oof
Burek with kulen isn't that bad of a idea
>Even Arkan didn't hate Croats as much (some sources even saying he helped Croats in the war)
Dude he was the leader of a death squad paramilitary group that massacred their way through Croatia and Bosnia
Do you eat bread with pasta
Careful what you answer because i've acquired a particular set of skills that make me a nightmare for people who eat bread with pasta
bread goes with a sandwich
I have pasta for that and no, yuck, wtf
Pasta is there instead of the bread
I actually found Istrian čakavian to be more similar to kajkavian than I expected, so I'd probably kinda manage if I know kajkavian
Maybe I do, maybe I don't. What disturbs me is you only eating bread with something you can dip it in
I can't imagine not eating bread with most things
It is essential
Most of my family freaks out without bread
I found that out too, especially when you hear words like tega/toga, and gremo/idemo
Really
I'm not sure that's true since we have a lot of italian words while in zagorje they have german
There's a word or two that's the same but i'm pretty sure that 2 guys, one speaking only istrian while the other speaking kajkavian from zagorje wouldnt understand each other at all
yes, the guy i replied to said
>We all really like that 'badass' culture, guns, weapons, etc
which simply isnt correct
i even said that it's mainly serbian criminal culture connected with turbofolk, it's not the same situation here
it's the same like every slovenian in this thread saying "not us".
i dislike any gun culture, i don't think civilians should own firearms without a proper reason, especially not carry them around
our countries are not unsafe, i really don't think anyone needs a gun in this day and age in croatia
unless you're a hunter or whatever
I wouldn't have such an optimistic view
There were at least two entire generations of people born and raised in friendship in Yugoslavia, and they were much closer to each other than we all are today
Yet still, the countries and the peoples went to war, and did terrible things to each other
That ephemeral friendship between individuals is nothing against mobilizied collective enmity and hatred
Trusting it's power is a mistake
A mistake which all our parents made as well
Its not essential lol
If i had to guess i'd say continental croatia, right
People dont eat that much bread in istria, especially the younger generations
From my experiences very few younger people eat bread in zagreb as well, its just not good for you
It's essential in my household
Also, not continental Croatia, Northern Adriatic here
it's ok, we can all have different opinions on the matter
Just dont tell me you're istrian because everything i believe in will fall apart
I thought people from adriatic (especially northern where there's more italian influence) know about their pasta and respect the sanctity of it
You can rest easy knowing I'm not Istrian
I live on an island and there is nothing better than some bread with your spaghetti
White bread with ragu
Your loss
Everything being written in Cyrillic in rural central Croatia (Kordun)
It's an area populated by Serbs but I didn't expect they actually used Cyrillic here that much
Here in coastal Croatia we say time the same way your Primorci do but in continental Croatia the same as continental Slovenia/Germany
Maybe it's because of the Adriatic :P
Was or still is
200 złoty
Ehh I think to maintain your Protestantism in a >80% Catholic country you probably have to be really hardcore in your beliefs
And I think Catholicism is generally more down with alcohol and holiday celebrations
Wow that's cheaper than a lot of places in Croatia
I don't hate Serbs
...THAT much
Don't we all hate politics
yea, go ride your bike around windmills or whatever you Dutch do
keep out of Balkan business
Puši kao Turčin - to smoke like a Turk, just means someone smokes alot
Arne Matteson's *One summer of happiness* was first movie shown in cinema with nudity
He even twenty years filmed an erotic movie [Ann and Eve] here
> An erotic drama about a youthful bride-to-be who takes a holiday to Yugoslavia with a cynical and evil lesbian film critic (and murderess) that leads to debauchery, degradation with a dwarf, a dinner with naked entertainers and other highlights
Erotic movies were quite popular at the time Danish [Hopa cupa u krevetu] was the most watched movie of 1977 in the country and Emanuelle series also had a big following
Blackface is not controversial topic at all, and it's commonly seen in carnival season and in nativity plays (Caspar)
People are unaware of anglophone context where it's seen as something obviously racist, no matter if there is malicious intent or not
My wife and I used to go to a spa with saunas where most people wore just towels and some were naked
Recently we went to Slovenia and it was quite the opposite, almost all people were naked
One thing was common, though
No swimsuits were allowed
I had to google it honestly which one was which and the result said that at first three kings represented old, middle-aged and young "magi" but in time they became kings and *Melkior* represented Europe, *Gašpar* represented Africa while *Baltazar* represented Asia
Ugh my relatives would get water guns out and spray us that way
I absolutely hated it
We burn a bloke called Fasnik
Aparently, most Slavs and some Baltic people have a similar tradition
Same in Croatia
Wtf
Pack your shit up guys, we have a winner
None of these are really internationally famous but
Josip Jelačić, ban of Croatia in the mid-19th century
He's considered a national hero, has a huge monument on the main square of Zagreb, his face is on the 20 kuna bill etc
etc
He's famous for fighting against Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848
A common trope in Croatian historiography is that Hungarians were vehemently anti-Croatian in their nationalism and that Jelačić defended our existence
This is
an exaggeration at best, and Jelačić was just a reactionary monarchist who also helped crush the revolutionary movement in Vienna and install the neo-absolutist government later on
Funny thing is that during the 19th century even Croatian nationalists hated his guts for being such a monarchist suck-up but that all changed with time
Other people would include our first president Franjo Tuđman and the leader of the interwar Croatian Peasant Party (in the 1930s at least) - Vlatko Maček
Ugh, he was VERY cruel and disgusting
Really ?
I think everyone hates the guy
What he has done
One problem I  have with Maček is his inactivity during WW2 ,but why do you think he was so bad  in the interwar period
On that list I might put Ante Starčević. Although influential in developing Croatian national identity,  his writing can come of as really primitive and xenophobic
Oh, he's the guy that operated in Rijeka, right
We had some italian nationalists couple of days ago who pulled out a flag of kingdom of italy (or something like that) infront of D'Annunzios house in Rijeka
Also, you built his monument in Trieste and our government isnt too happy about it
How is he seen in modern Ukraine ?
All embrace me, It’s my time to rule at last
Well, he gave in to anti-semitic policies of the late 1930s royal government and supported its authoritarian turn - best seen in the formation of concentration camps for communists and communist sympathizers in 1939, which were then simply handed over to the Ustaše in 1941 with most inmates still inside (for instance Kerestinec)
Also yeah, the passivity
It's not just simple passivity though, HSS just turned its coat and gave its massive party apparatus over to the Ustaše, together with the bureaucracy of the Croatian Banovina
The Croatian Peasant and Citizen Guard - a HSS paramilitary organization - formed the backbone of Ustaša rule in the first few weeks after the occupation
Maček was fine with that, he just didn't want to give official party support to the Ustaše, probably hoping that at some point the old regime would come back
I agree on Starčević, though I think he was a more interesting and nuanced figure than people think today
Lol, you think so
Dude, my government is giving importance to everything that can maybe shift the focus from the actual problems
It happens all the time
Ok, the statue is retarded, especially if he's a fascist but i've never heard of him before a couple of days ago and i dont care about a couple of italian idiots trying to stir some shit up
And its not like we dont have a history with idiotic monuments ourselves
It's dark in my room ,dude !
I think Ottomans impaled people vertically while Vlad did it transversally
I understood that reference
I am sorry, Mr
Lebowski
I read it somewhere ,but not being sure I wrote
>I think
I'd say it's the '40s and ustasa regime
There were stories about the ss officers visiting croatia and writing back home how cruel ustasas are
You gotta stop and think about shit you're doing if even the germans were appalled by your actions
Hungary monarch came to the Croatian throne, about 11th century, we haven't had a sovereign country since then
Well
Hmmmm
that's the one you pick
Really
Id say first Yugoslavia was more stupid, like Stjepan Radić said "You are rushing like geese into a fog". First Yugoslavia ended up being really oppressive towards Croats, which led to dissent and rise of Ustasha regime, if we stayed out of Yugoslavia, Ustasha regime wouldn't get backed by so much people like it did, you have to understand at start that regime looked like freedom to many Croats because how oppressive first Yugoslavia was
Dude
Really
It's like germany saying the dumbest thing is joining in with the austro hungary on the war because if it werent for world war 1 hitler would never rose to power
The dumbest thing croatians did was settle here in the 7th century because we should have fucking gone somewhere away from balkans
Tbh i'd pick the gavrilo princip thingy but then again, i have no idea what happened with bulgaria
Should have stayed with our Czech brothers and sisters =(
At least they often visit
We'll consider it if you return trieste to slovenia
Yeah, maybe
Never mind, carry on
Not most beautiful one, far from it, but [Bosnia and Herzegovina plates] have practical reason behind it
The letters and numbers are all random for the fact that there are still unsettled issues after the war in the 90s where the country was torn apart between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats
In order to prevent people destroying or damaging other people's cars, they removed any canton/regional association from the plates
&#x200B;
On the other hand, I really love old German, Austrian and Swiss plates, with each region having their coat of arms on it
I'm Croat, the national emblem is ugly
just a checker board or red and white checkered fields would be nice
The whole flag is ugly but it is also revered
They do seem practical and I love the fact that the plates are bound to the car for its lifetime, but other than being practical, I see no real difference or usefulness between Irish plates and some totally random numbers/letters
The information on the plates is irrelevant, and especially since Irish plates can be transferred from Wexford to Galway, they don't tell much about the car/driver either
In Bosnia for example, the plates are made random on purpose, because some cantons over there are basically *in war* and having clear identifier visible on your car could lead to some bad situations
Sincere apologies Slovenac :)
I didn't think of your plates at all :(
I would say Rijeka since the other cities on the coast suffered from the lack of tourists and Rijeka isn't really a tourist city
Other cities inland also nothing special and I can't put Zagreb since the earthquake damage still exists
Rijeka was the European capital of culture for 2020 and because of that and the EU the whole town is renovating
A new square is also in the process of building
Osijek is also a city I would like to put because near it ,a new highway is in the making,a new stadium is going to be built and a new campus for students is also there
Trst za siromašne
I only see them on the edges of towns and forests
Same
Same thing for me
I feel like the geek culture is not that popular in Croatia
You serious
Before coronavirus struck my group had 3 D&D games ongoing
Absolutely packed to max
We were playing one or two/week
We're in Zagreb though
As far as I know, dnd and other geeky tabletop games are barely popular here
I know a handful of people who know them
It is true that national TV broadcasts Star Trek reruns and the fact that we had some really good magazines, but I don't think they are popular outside the biggest cities
I'm serious for the rest of Croatia
I also know some people who played or still play in various groups in Krapina, Varaždin, Kutina, Osijek, Rijeka, Opatija, Pazin, Umag, Zadar and Split
Though, granted, Zagreb is probably the largest center of geekdom in the country
Rijeka is not far behind though
I would agree with you
I am attending a technical school in Osijek so 90% of the time I am surrounded by people who want to be "like everybody else" and are not that interested in geeky things
I think officially there is no line in regular letters
In cursive, Z looks like backward 3 anyway so the line is not there anyway
Personally, i put it on the capital version and not on the lowercase
We have them but they are really, really rare
Tipping
Tbh peanutbutter and jelly is a fucking amazing combo
I would never have thought it would be that good
I guess people like seeing the stereotypes surrounding them and what other people think of them, I can't blame them tbh, I like seeing stereotypes and shit about my country
Well yeah but there you must tip
If I dont like your service and think you were rude, I sure as hell am not giving you shit let alone 15-20%.
I drink coffee everyday in a coffee shop and I pay 8 kuna for it, so 7 of us pay 56kn together, but obviously round it up to 60kn
To my understanding if I were in the US and tried to pay by card, the machine would give me options for a 10%-15%+ tip like I must do it
That would all be above 60kn and would round up to a weird number
That's what I dont understand
I've heard this before, but I can't believe it, the tips are already in the price
Isn't that like, breaking the law or something
Seems ridicoulus
Test the soup and send them to jail lol
If someone spitted in my soup I couldn't have given less of a fuck tbh
Not really in the whole country
All the infrastructure was built during the communist era, so most buildings are just big cubes with people
Other than that, we have great really old architecture, but almost nothing modern
Well, that depends
Does everyone suddenly get reasonable over nationalism and sovereignty
And by that I obviously mean come closer to what I think is reasonable
Then all the way
Make us a federal state like the US
However, if everyone doesn't suddenly get reasonable about these very, very emotionally charged topics, then it's a very difficult question
I would integrate further in some areas, but not all
For now I'd focus on unifying our foreign relations and defence, hopefully completely
Next up would be a harmonization of taxes and economic regulation to ease the inequalities between richer and poorer states
Next up, reduce the Council's power, and make it simply an upper house of the EU parliament, akin to the US system with Representatives (allocated broadly by population size) and Senators (allocated equally among all states)
That might prove overly ambitious though
Croatian Disney Princess is the daughter of a war veteran (likely a fake one) turned politician, has access to everything for free, her companion is a marten, and her magical power is making the tax payers' money disappear
We do as part of WW2
Not in detail, more like a general synopsis
Zagreb Cathedral (the tallest building)
Museum Mimara
Croatian national thetre (HNK)
Ban Jelačić statue (gotta assert Zagreb dominance)
**Ancient**
[The Pula arena] - one of the best preserved roman amphitheatres in the world, still used today (WC 2018, Croatia-England match)
[Palace of the roman emperor Diocletian AD 305 in Split]
[And today]
**Gothic, Renaissance**
[Šibenik cathedral] - very unusual mix of gothic and Renaissance styles, incredible structural solutions for its dome and vaults
**Vienna secession**
[Old National and university library in Zagreb, now State Archives]
**Contemporary**
[Sea Organ & The Greetings To The Sun in Zadar ]
Police, tram conducters, TV licence incasators, journalists, bankers, judges and lawyers
That's insanely expensive
I mean, we pay 80kn (cca 10gbp) and still hate it
Here's a reason, at least for Croatia:
A lot of corrupt people (Politicians, sport officials, CEOs) from Croatia have dual citizenship with Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of them, and even when sentencing happens they are allowed to go to Bosnia and carry out their sentence there, but what actually happens is that their courts have to confirm that sentence, which they normally lower and in a lot of cases even overturn, because their country is even more corrupt, so they stay there, on a sort of vacation, and once thing goes old in legal terms, they come back and carry on doing business as usual
The most recent case is Zdravko Mamic, it's even become a meme now that whenever there is some laege sentencing against someone (happens every few weeks) we joke how there might be some traffic jams on Bosnian border

Whenever I see those "France always surrenders jokes" or "America/oil jokes" I instantly picture you as a fucking idiot
I'm gonna be a bit different here
I like joking and seeing jokes on Americans
I don't like any country being criticized except USA xd
Sorry bald eagles
But there's just so much about you
Ayy thanks mate
Even tho sometimes there are incredible deep dicsussions or argues online between Croatians and Serbs
On social media I mean
I never do that ofc
To whoever insults our Czech bros: be careful, we know places where not even Croatian Mountain Service can find you :)
" Yeah maybe invading half the planet while portraying yourself as the valiant bastion of freedom does that to you
&#x200B;
I don't understand how precisely the first thing cancels out the second one, however almost every time US has invaded a country they've been liberated from a certain totalitarian regime
"but American oil jokes are surprisingly accurate, "
Incredibly inaccurate, actually
America has been importing oil mostly from Canada/Saudi Arabia before becoming self dependent
Wars in Iraq and Syria weren't about the American oil, for example Iraqi war, 2/3 trillion were spent on it, US could've increased it's oil production for 1/5th of that price
Also, Solar/Wind Energy would be a good thing to develop, considering America has one of the best renewable energy sources potential, unlike the rest of the Western world
I was an enormous baby, my mom barely gave birth to me
So the doctor called me Tiki - which was the name of the water heater - smaller boiler  but the shape is still there
They kept it thru my childhood
My sister’s nickname was Vrtirepka, thats the words play of ‘spinning tail’ cause she was always jumping around, running, spinning and early twerking :D
Funny thing is that both my sis and I have a 3 letters name so we don’t actually need no nicknames
My dad calls me "bebo" (kinda like "little baby") and žabo (frog)
I didn't have one
There were only my parents and I, we all just called each other "you" and "him/her".
The whole world is slowly going towards legalizing weed but you guys want to go in the opposite direction and ban everything that's bad for you
What the fuck
If grown ass people wanna smoke let them fucking smoke, who are you to tell them if they can or can't do it
Well, how else would they practice their lying and stealing skills
There is a reason why the foreskin exists it isn't useless
You two should move to saudi arabia, you'll like it there
Just look at the fucking prohibition and all the gangsters that rose to power because they could smuggle alcohol
I said grown ass men, not kids
Again, if you wanna go down that path then you should ban everything that's bad for you, starting with obesity
So no sodas, no greasy food, no salt, etc
We'll be all eating that stuff from matrix that tastes like chicken
Because that's exactly what i said
Following your logic, do you think that water and food should be criminalized
You really think you'll get affected by a short wiff of someone's cigarette
While breathing the fucking smog from cars the whole day
Come on, chill the fuck down
What are you going on about for fucks sake
Hopefully none
But you equating cigarettes with heroin is the same as equating them with water, fucking ridiculous
Decriminalize marijuana
Better criminalize everything else
Drinking beer-12 years in max security prison, smoking a cigarette-life sentence without the possibility of parole
In Zagreb's lake Jarun there is something like a Loch Ness, it is called " catfish Jura" which is a 300kg heavy catfish
As I understood it, the legend came to be because a lot of people would drown in the lake
Also, Baba Roga was a thing, which was used to scare children
It is a witch with a big nose and horns
Then this [dude] who turned into a vampire
And [The Black Queen] from Plitivce Lakes who made the lakes
I guess we have more fairies than monsters, I remember my grandma telling me that she saw fairies dancing in a circle on a meadow when she was young
They were motives in art and literature a lot
There is The Fairy of Velebit, Fairy Kosjenka from Tales of Long Ago, the paintings of [Vlaho Bukovac] etc
At least for me while growing up, I would hear so many tales about fairies
Omg I can relate to this so much
Especially when she starts yelling at me that I'm going to die if I don't eat lol
Your brain knows the rules and applies them without having to think about it
We just sort of know it
In Croatian we don't have articles to show the gender of the world, but to determine and prove the gender of a certain word, you say for example *this* table
In Croatian in the "this" part the gender is visible
For example:
ovaj stol (this table)-masculine
ova stolica (this chair)-feminine
ovo stablo (this tree)-neutrum
But of course, in the daily use of the language you don't always use "this", so it's common sense
You usually use this method when you're in school doing some grammar tasks and you need to determine the gender, you ask yourself what "this" would you use so that you surely determine the gender
no articles and if it did have some it woulde come naturally simple becuse its my native language i mean if you get good enough in english you stop worrying about articles and they start coming natrually
No articles, but we do have gendered words and declensions depend on the word gender
To find out the gender of the word, we usually use "this" in place of an article (masculine: "ovaj stol" - "this desk", feminine: "ova polica" - "this shelf", neuter: "ovo ljeto" - "this summer")
Same in Croatian
Yeah, looks strange to me too for it to be feminine
We usually use our word for "this" (ovaj/ova/ovo) in place of articles when trying to find out the "gender" of the word, and anything but "ovaj Bangladeš" would sound
weird
maybe its the fact i dont speak german but i dont think native speakers or people that are good at the language woulde have to guess but idk maybe im wrong about that assumption
There are a lot of movies from other countrys we have german cobra 11 uk movies too few from us and turkish ones were a lot of times seen
I don't think we have any stereotypes about us specifically
It's more generalization of "Balkan blob" and stereotypes that come with that
This is more of a generalized Balkan stereotype, but I hate it when people think we all hate each other, like nah, most people here are normal regular human beings and have nothing against other regular people from other countries
In Croatia there's a stereotype that you guys like to go hiking in flip flops, due to incidents where tourists go hiking wearing flip flops and inevitably have to be rescued
Isn’t there a stereotype that we drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigarettes
Same
Those stereotypes are probably for all of Balkan’s
not under 25C for sure and even then I'll reconsider if it's windy
10-12, I love colder weather, cant stand summer, if its above 25 its like my energy is being drained faster
A Dutch friend of mine told me that when it finally hits 20C in the Netherlands in spring everyone is outside wearing shorts
Here right now it's 15C (no wind and humid albeit cloudy) and I have a t-shirt, a sweater and a jacket on
It's not cold, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing only a hoodie
-King Tomislav,first king of Kingdom od Croatia
-Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan,leaders of the movement against Austrians
-Josip Jelacic,leader of the movement against Hungarians
-Ljudevit Gaj,Croatian language
-Ante Gotovina,general in Croatian Homeland war/War of the independence
-I would add Ante Pavelic,who established Croatia in WW2 after 800 years of foreign rule and Josip Broz Tito who established Yugoslavia and gained territory from Italy but these two were faschist and communist so yeah
in my region
[Andrijica Šimić] fought against ottomans
[Mijat Tomić] fought against ottomans
[Ivan Musić] of the Herzegovina uprising in western Herzegovian and a Catholic priest
[Mate Boban] of the self-proclaimed Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia
[Slobodan Praljak] during the war in the 90s
What about that student that set himself on fire I think post WWII
>who was born in our country Josip Broz Tito
what
had no idea that Kumrovec was in Slovenia
Lol "established croatia in ww2". As a puppet state maybe
And how long did that last
What a fucking hero
Why do we have to be the only fucking retards in this thread that have to name a fucking nazi
Why cant we be normal like the rest of europe
Ante pavelic, give me a fucking break
It's half-half wherever you go in ex-Yu
I dont like either but some people favor Pavelic and some favor Tito so I included them both haha although people who love Tito hate Pavelic and vice versa
I said that I dont like him but a lot of people(and you know it) like him smh
Yup, my bad
No problem, I also remember Jan III
Sobjeski from school
He was Polish as well, right
fine
we don't want him anyway
My Great-Grandfather fought in WW1
He was captured by the Russians but later joined them
When the Russian Civil War began, he was transported across Siberia to Vladivostok and then to the Salonica front, but the war ended before he got there
He also served in WW2 in the Independent State of Croatia
He was a local garrison commander but was secretly hiding a Jewish girl from the authorities
My grandfather and all of his brothers served in WW2 but most of them didn’t see combat
My father served in the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1996) but also never saw combat
My great-grandpa was in the partizani in ww2
A nice round 0
Weren’t the Emperors of Austria and Kings of Hungary the ones with the title “King of Jerusalem”?
Wtf
Interspar is the best German store, not Lidl
Kebab is overrated
What are some "fake" English words that are used in your country
I've noticed that it's quite "trendy" to use English words and change them up a bit for use in everyday conversations in a lot of countries
An example would be that young people in Germany (from my own experience) tend to say "He's so fame in Germany" "The song is really fame" etc in German, but with the "fame" sticking out
I recently discovered that party-breaker (or partibrejker) isn't used in english
The meaning is basically the same as "party pooper"
It's a fairly common term here, there is even a famous Serbian band named [Partibrejkers]
in istria, croatia we call jeans "rifle" but not rifle, as you'd read it in english, it's pronounced as it's written so you'd pronounce it "ree-fle" (fle part as in souffle)
probably someone, decades ago, brought the rifle jeans from a western country and people just read what it says
All have the same meaning in Croatian, except footing
Try to pearn a bit of croatian
People increase the prices if they hear you're a tourist
In Zagreb, a common scam is a person approaching you pretending to be deaf and mute with a leaflet asking for donations
Lol, where
And how would "dobar dan" on broken croatian with soft "r"s convince someone that you're croatian
I never heard of someone increasing their prices for tourists, what do you mean by that
Prices in restaurants and bars are fixed and are written in the menu, if anyone increased it it's easy to notice
The only possible location where they can increase the prices is the local markets but even they have their prices displayed
I dont know, usually its really easy to tell
Maybe they just thought you can speak it
Ahaaaaa, you mean ćevapi
Excellent choice
Who doesn't love a good old sarma mmm
Sharpen your knives roman army veteran and let's dance
Either the flag of Independent State of Croatia or any Yugoslav flag (including the flag of SR Croatia)
As with everything historic or even vaguely political, Croatia comes in with at least two opposing stances :D
I think if you remove the conatation on the SR flag, the flag is still quite  a boring flag ngl
rock paper sicors (idk spelling bruh) but more brutal
if you play rock and the other plays sicors you win and get to punch the other one in the shoulder
if you play paper and the other plays rock you win and get to slap them
if you play sicors and the other plays rock you win and take your index and middle finger(the ones you use to make the sicors) and slap the other person on the wrist
keep playing till someone wants to stop or a teacher gets mad
Krvava Kuna (Bloody Kuna [Croatian currency]): we would take a coin and spin it on the table
The game is actually stupid, there's no winner or anything, all you had to do is to keep it spinng by hitting it with your finger and whoever fails has to put their fist against the wall and the rest of us would shoot a coin at it
Sometimes you would end up with bloody knuckles, hence the name
Tapkanje (doesn't mean anything, comes from the sound of hitting the floor with your hands "TAP
"): anytime when there was a European or World cup in football all the boys would collect stickers
Now, instead of buying, we would put 2 stickers on the floor, one next to each other (face-up) and try to turn them face-down with our hands, but no grabbing, obviously, only using the vacuum your hands can make to lift them up
I was actually very good at this, I would fill up my entire album very quickly without buying new stickers very often
We did all of that, except for the break in line
We also had a game that we called "prćenje", which is a rude word for "leaning over". We'd line up, and kick the crossbar of a goal with the ball
The one who misses has to stand at the goal and lean over
We'd then kick the ball as hard as we could, while usually doing our best to hit the middle area under the ass, hoping that the ball will strike the nuts
Then there was the "magic circle". A group would approach an individual and one person would tap him on the shoulder, and then we'd punch and kick him until he names the person that tapped him
And finally, these weren't exactly games per se, but we also had the "paralysis" and the "slide". The latter would be running as fast as you could, and then use to marble floor to slide into someone's legs at a high velocity, while the former was running up to someone, and using your knee to hit them in the outer side of the thigh, the aim being hitting the nerve as hard as possible
I also very vaguely remember the mad cow disease thing
Someone would have the mad cow disease, and they would be ew to touch
There was a way to transfer it to another person, but I don't remember how it worked
I believe this gave birth to using "cattle" as an insult for individuals, regardless of them having the mad cow disease or not
We had exact same thing here in Croatia lol
I would say something like jebenti mater maybe
Well, the entire "greater Hungary" stuff is not really sitting too well here, and we still haven't forgotten about Khuen-Héderváry Károly, but TBH we got far bigger and more recent grievances with most of our other neighbors, so we're cool :)
Yeah, more or less
It's not always easy explaining medieval feudal concepts when we're more or less used to how modern states work, and 19th century and how people were trying to reform feudalism was often messy
We were the seperate kingdom, but under the same crown since 1097, joined at the hip for 800 years
Hungarian side was dominant in that relationship, but most of our shared history consists of fighting Ottomans side by side, so while there was some bad history between us, the majority was not bad
A lot of Croats are regulars on Sziget festival, or flying from/to Budapest Liszt Ferenc
I've been to Hungary several times, and I have some friends there, and I like it there - it's still a similar culture, cuisine, prices etc
Although I have to say I haven't picked up much Hungarian apart from the basics such as "szia", "köszi", "sör", "nem beszélek magyarul, beszélsz angolul
" and "baszd meg, kurva anyád". I was actually supposed to go to Hungary twice this year, but unfortunately COVID happened :( It would've been fun
Oh my God, this game
I visited Finland on a student exchange last year and we I played this with my host
M friends also played it with their hosts, literally every single person has it in their home
In croatia its called Čovječe ne ljuti se and is enjoyed by people of all ages
Id say for me it gets more vicious than monopoly
Everyone knows the beautiful Croatian coast and Zagreb with the best European advent but noone knows about Osijek
Osijek is a town with 100k people so it is fairly big on Croatian standards
It is situated on the Drava river in the east of Croatia near Hungary and Serbia between the Slavonia and Baranja regions of the Pannonian Basin
Osijek has an old town Tvrđa which is currently on the might be UNESCO heritage list
It is old dating from the 16th century with the old wall looking at the river
In Tvrđa itself you have cobblestone streets with old classy buildings all around with schools everywhere
Other than Tvrđa Osijek has a hanging bridge which has lights at night and the main square and the town itself has old style Austro-Hungarian architecture and buildings
The concathedral is very tall being second tallest in Croatia after Zagreb(currently tallest since the Zagreb cathedral suffered from earthquakes) and is a gothic style cathedral
Along the river you can walk throughout the whole length of the city and also Trams which are the first ones in Croatia and still go through the whole city
Also the oldest  national theatre is here in Osijek too
Zagreb, the largest city in Croatia
It’s the capital, but all tourists go to the Croatian coast, so they don’t care about it because it’s in the interior
You should know of Pecs definitely , I'm no Hungarian but on the border there in Croatia
Pecs is a city in the Baranya region where the geothermal springs come out
You have several villages around Pecs with a lot of them having geothermal baths
Pecs itself is on a mountain basin and has the usual Austro-Hungarian architecture with the town hall being very beautiful and the old town is self is charming with parks,squares and statues everywhere
Other than Pecs I don't really know what to say as I have only been to Budapest which is very famous but I heard Gyor is quite nice too and also Kaposvár.
Austro-Ugarska monarhija in Croatian
Austro - Ugarska monarhija (Austro - Hungarian monarchy), if separately speaking then Carevina Austrija (empire of Austria) and Kraljevina Ugarska (kingdom of Hungary)
Commonly: just Austro-Ugarska (Austria-Hungary)
Also sometimes Habsburška monarhija (Habsburg monarchy)
Austro-Ugarska
People look back to the past and not think about present or future
We can change our constitution through a national referendum
I beleve its only happened twice so far

"verati" is an old word for "to climb" so I assume that's where the word comes from
A few
Not recognising Armenian genocide being one of them
Same here, some of our weapons even ended in ISIS hands
I'm curious, do our people actually think that it didn't happen or is our government just lying to itsself
Huh oh boy, we suck up to turkey everytime we can, along with that we also suck up to israel and usavall the time also and all decisions they make we support, and lately we are starting to suck up to china
The government not wanting to piss off Turkey I believe
Kim can’t afford them
That’s the line

Weather nazis were good or bad
Ožujko vs Karlovačko vs Pan  beer
I've never heard anyone unironically defend the Ustaše,I've heard people defend communism though
Nope, nope, nope
This is classic example of "everyone with whom I don't agree is a nazi"
Debate most of the time is who was ustasha, partizan, domobran or chetnik
And whether partizans were good like they are represented or better yet is killing people a crime even if it's for a good cause and other stuff like that, no one is actually defending the nazis, no one sane at least, the debate is around partizan's and was their cause just based on what it brought to Croatia as a consequence along with their treatment of war prisoners
Akso this is not seneless or stupid, history need to be taught so it is not repeated, far more stupid thing is argument about whether burek with cheese is really a burek
Hint: It is
Slovenians
Hold my beer
Im still bus guy since my country is not very reliable in railways department
Croatia isn't shown so much in movies as much as it is talked about as some 3rd world country somewhere far away
Yes, I learned when I was 3
I know a lot of people
I'd like a game set during Dutch golden age
We call Slovenian Janezi
Male name in Slovenia is Janez
Wwii period, the croatian kingdom and the croatian war of independence
Of course the victory in the 90s war with Serbia, and thats cool I guess
But also, Independent state of Croatia
WW2 Nazi puppet and Ustaše movement
not so cool
Yeah, duck and turkey being the most common, goose perhaps if someone has its own
I prefer ducks and turkey
Rijeka is the ugliest town in Croatia imo
it's one of the only towns with terrible weather, it looks industrial and unwelcoming
it always rains, roads are tiny and always too crowded, there is no straight part and everything is full of steep streets and you are constantly walking either downhill or uphill
ugly and impractical town
Ill say rijeka from the bigger ones (ex-industrial, port town with a mishmash of every style possible)
For smaller ones there are dozens of candidazes
Inland is full of former industrial towns where the single employing industry collapsed/bankrupted/left and/or war happened and now they are just depressing
Bigger cities and places on the coast have tourism as a fall back, these are stuck
Opatija:
Rijeka:
Have you never been to Sisak or Beli Manastir
Yes definitely, Rijeka was just built on a cliff and it got big because Austria-Hungary needed a port somewhere
Streets steep and small, currently half of the city is digged up I don't know how they got for European capital of Culture
Inland towns such as Glina or a city like Slavonski Brod where industries didnt really collapse but the city itself is just fucked
Water is bad, air is awful and it is in the poorest county
I have never been to either
The sea should be the one afraid [of the dutch]
Using "sumljam" instead of "sumnjam". While sumnjati means to doubt something
I heard about mistaking your and you\`re but I didn't notice that at all in my English classes
Also "valda" instead of "valjda"!
It's totally normal for us Dalmatians to say "reka" tho and nobody cares
Croats also struggle with "u redu".
Hey
That's regional
Since average salary in Finland is pretty standard for a developed EU nation, it absolutely makes it an outlier if they really pay their interns that much (compared to other countries where the relative intern pay is orders of magnitude lower)
It was unbelievable
You could just look up and not see the end of some of them
And they are everywhere lol
But subway stations are really dirty and unwelcoming, feel like they should work on that
In Croatian, “Despicable Me” was translated as “How Gru stole the Moon” (Kako je Gru ukrao Mjesec)
“Die Hard” became “Die Manly” (Umri muški)
Or even better, Die Like a Man
Exactly the same thing happened to me
I was very fortunate and agile so he hasn't carried out the act until the end but it is still extremelly traumatising
I still have issues walking alone in the dark, even through a very safe and familiar neighbourhoods
The act is so over-the-top you can't help but like it, just for the sheer silliness of it
So we could say that WWII was domestic abuse
I rarely see any other type of window
Those are just normal windows to me, funny how the guy in the video finds them so amazing
Literally every building has them
It's just a window, mate
Exactly that
We have a similar thing, we call toothpaste *kaladont* thanks to the monopoly of one austrian [toothpaste manufacturer] back in the day
Agadmator, and I don’t even care about chess that much
KAMBER izam
He’s awesome
I found him recently and binged all his videos
Oof I really don’t know
Cats personally, 100%. Though I like dogs too, but I'm kinda scared of some of them and in my opinion cats are just much cuter
Nationally it's probably 50-50, personally I've met plenty of both dog and cat people
And I can't really guess about the continental preference since I haven't been to every country in Europe
I'm a snake person
As for the furry friends, no preference really
In croatia, i see lots of people with dogs, since they are more handy for hunting, running and sniffing out stuff in the countryside, and i think the fact so many people have dogs in the countryside gave people a trust for dogs, so there’s lots in cities too
This says a lot because I have noticed a lot of Brits are more cat people than dog people
The Irish yet again win, I wish there was someone to analyze this
I would say rusyn
Istriot, spoken by 400 people in southwestern Istria, mostly in Rovinj
Wait, indonesia has 700 languages
How is that possible
I always thought india leads in language diversity but i guess i was so wrong
How are those languages different
Can people understand each other with ease
Can you give me a comparison maybe
What does size have to do with it
By that logic russia should have 50
000 languages
I know, man, i'm just saying that the size doesnt matter that much, its the islands and isolation
There are bigger countries out there with a fraction of the languages you have
These are for Luxembourg
Not necessarily unknown but interesting nevertheless
SES S.A. (Astra) - one of the world's biggest telecommunication satellite operator, headquartered in Betzdorf
ArcelorMittal - world biggest steel producer
And obvious one
RTL Group - Radio Television Luxembourg, one of the biggest TV groups in  Europe, having presence in many European countries
They are often thought of as a German company, but they're actually Luxembourgish
I think there's kind of a similar situation in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the RS constitution allowing the use of capital punishment but the overall BiH constitution forbidding it
Actually I just checked it out and it seems that the Constitutional court of Bosnia and Herzegovina finally came around to officially insist on banning the death penalty in RS
It happened just a few days ago
Yes and that's my pet peeve when it comes to it, it's less of a geographical denominator and has more to do with politics
The only correct answer here
Thanks bud
I fly from Venice, much closer, some even go to Budapest
Why would we exclude Greece
It's right next to the Balkan mountain range in Bulgaria
From a Croat point of view (how I was taught in primary school), we include Slovenia and southern parts of Romania around the Danube as Balkans as well
Hungary is Central Europe
Athens doesn't ring a bell
Or Istanbul
Why wouldn't it be
booo mitteleuropa nerd here
Neither is Croatia and Slovenia but here we are
And Croatia and Slovenia would be
because
Ok, sure, why
Ok, fair enough
I would normally say it's failure of the British public school system except that that term, the Balkans, is a so very nebulous term that has less to do with geography, and more to do with politics
And perceptions
Wait till you learn about Croatian coast
Ok, fair enough, but then why use the term when you consciously know it isn't right
And I'm asking honest to God question here because I am curious as hell
Wouldn't it be like me saying "the English" when referring to Scots, Irish and Welsh people even though I know it's incorrect
But where is the Balkan mountain range situated
And Romania isn't a Slavic country
You are kinda equating ex-Yu with the term which further adds to the confusion
True, but whenever I feel sad I remember the US and everything seems better
No need to apologize and thank you for the feedback and clarification
I mean not literally in the backyard, but there are constant diggings around our coast and islands, finding some Roman or Byzantine artifacts
City I grew up has a couple of Venetian forts overlooking the cities from 15th and 16th century, and a Cathedral built in the same time period
A city I currently live has a Roman palace in it's center and couple of Roman aqueduct ruins laying around
Digging in the backyard not likely, but there are roman ruins in the cifies and countryside, there are medieval castles about and many churches are also quite old
So i would say its pretty common
Even most of government and cultural buildings are from 19th century
In my hometown, of some 30 000 people, there's a part of [14th century defensive wall] behind the cathedral finished in 1882
So there's that
The history ends with Croatian war of independence, and in truth that is the way it should be, now bear with me, it's not a nationalistic view
The thing is, our participation in EU is relatively short, and it needs to pass more than 20-30 years to make a serious historical oversight of it
Other than that, EU is studied in a lesser degree in lessons about the rest of the world during the 50s to 90s, but enough to understand political dealings, of course, I'm only talking about history, and this should probably be studied in a subject that teaches more about politics, everyday stuff and etc
There are subjects that explain that in high school, but they are interested only in the economical or political sides of it, they mostly don't bring full context to it
In Croatia we say "ptičica" which means "little bird"
In Croatian we say “Ptičica
” (Birdie
) with a very cheerful intonation
"i" is pronounced similar to english "ee" and there's 2 of those in that word
Just don’t say anything about the early to mid 90’s and it’ll be fine
I'm always astounded how massive Malta's population is
I mean I thought our island of Brač (pop ~14,000, 400km^2) was decently populated and then I read somewhere that Malta has a population of more than 500,000 on an area of a bit more than 300km^2
No shit, they all came here to us for a little dip in the sea
I cant even enter my living room at day time without getting stung
though I must say there might be a little less of them this year
It's our new plan of attack
A shit, shouldn't have said anything
i think Ireland would fall apart, like litteraly a fall apart in 30-is different countries and everyone would become separate island and drift off to Atlantic that would be known as ocean of sadness
UK would do the same but they are already heading for shitstorm that potatoes vanishing would be just
one of sucky days
fish with fish fingers
We would be sitting with the other Balkan nations  way too drunk off Rakija, trying to cut the table in parts so we don’t collectively get in a fist fight that starts WWIII
We’d also be eyeing the cute Irish and smirking at England knowing how we did during the World Cup
Some interesting trivia is sure to be skipped
Really cool one is that a Croat was the last king of Hawaii
Technically a prince consort as it seems
I took some liberty here
Technically he was a prince-consort ,but he was married to the last queen of Hawaii

They are growing in popularity
Usually run by the Catholic Church, they send young people for a week somewhere on the coast
It consists of masses, sports, lectures, etc
I went a few times, not too expensive and a great way to meet new people with the same values
If you can't afford, sometimes a local priest pays for it
Mine too
completely agree
I don't expect foreign schools to teach about Croatian history
I am so much dissapointed that people don't learn about Nikola Zrinski/Miklos Zrinyi and Siege of Szigetvar
That last stand is something that rivals Battle of Thermopylae
You do taxes like Americans
We have it all calculated by the state (employers pay it)
I just from time to time get tax return and I have no idea why
A present
And what’s difficult with buying or renting apartments that you need to learn in school
Hitler was Austrian not German
Austrian as a national identity distinct from German was only born post WW2 when everyone wanted to distance themselves from Germany and it's Nazi reputation
Before that Austria was just one of many German states and pretty much all Austrians considered themselves Germans
I guess "always" started in 1918
I think Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was one of the first countries to recognise USA
Really ? How does Croatia show up ?
"Austrian identity" existed but it wasn't any less German than Prussian or Bavarian identity at the time
There's a reason why after WW1 you named your country [German Austria] and the allies forced you to change the name, there's a reason the treaty of Versailles had to forbid you from joining Germany
And there's a reason why you eventually did join Germany
The reason being that at the time overwhelming majority of Austrians absolutely felt German
So you didn’t learn it in school
Made by IPSOS one of the most renown survey companies, I don't know why you would dismiss it as useless

May 1st is holiday, but if it falls on weekend then you are out of luck
No, they’re never shifted in Croatia
once a day, usually before work or faculty classes
however if i go to doctor, do sports lr going out then I also take shower before
I have pizza cutter somewhere in the dusty drawer
It a) comes precut or b) I use a knife to cut it to slices
I feel like I would be one of the weirded out guys
At this point, I'm now wondering, is cutting the pizza with scissors the correct way
I feel like everyone in Slavonia, Srijem and Bosnia jokes about Herzegovina
For instance, there is a tweet that says "Greetings from the capitol of Herzegovina"
And it's a picture of Zagreb
For all of you not familiar with the fact, Zagreb has a high number of people from Herzegovina
Zagreb because it is the capital and hogs most of the media so we always joke about them
They also have a mayor[Milan Bandić] who is quite an astonishing fella
No, thank you, we're full
Very well put
Short and to the point
Pretty much on point
I would just like to add that due to a massive influx of southerners (including Croats from B&H), certain parts of Zagreb don't even feel like Zagreb, people are much more extroverted and politically to the right
Also a reason why there is some level of animosity towards Rijeka which is traditionally the most left wing city in Croatia probably
Zagreb is to Croatia what New York is to the world, you can find people from every little corner of our country
Hell, sometimes it's hard to find someone who is even a 3rd gen native
You're right
Various foreign powers held the cities at some point
For example, Zagreb has German name - Agram and Osijek - Esseg (it has Hungarian and Turkish variant aswell)
Recommend for a trip or a longer period
Like 90% are mandatory
The flu shot is optional and I may be missing some other vaccines, not sure
Most often localised names are used, sometimes are not
Charlemagne is always Karlo Veliki
Louis XIV is Luj XIV
While George is more often George though some used the name Đuro which sounds kinda funny
Modern monarchs except Elizabeth are refered in their original
To me it's so wierd how the queen is Elizabeta II but her sons and grandsons are Charles, Harry
So you're telling me i wont be able to open my own hotel with 5 cents
I beg to differ
There are some countries i'd theoretically like to move to because i'm getting sick of primitivism here but not a lot
I also think that it's the classic case of the grass is always greener and that other countries dont have it any better than us here
For example, germany is not one of those countries
I've lived there for a year when i was studying and i had enough
Germans are strange, hard to live amongst
Dont get me wrong, i like germany as a nation and i have a lot of german friends but i'm just not used to your mentality
I believe its the same other way around, you'd come here and be amazed how lazy we are
But that's just depending on what you're used to
For me most germans are like robots, until you come here for your vacation and go crazy
This summer me and a couple of friends bought a small boat and we went around the islands here and we talked about how we have this every summer, for free, while people pay thousands of euros to come here for 1 week
I literally think i'd kill myself if i had the sea for 1 week per year
I cant live without it
I really think that the quality of life, especially for kids is better in croatia than in a bunch of other more developed west european countries
That being said, there's an obvious problem with corruption, health care and other stuff so yeah, you win some, you lose some
I don't have a lot of experience, but a common tradition in shift work jobs here is, if you work the late/night shift, to take regular smoke breaks and stay at work an hour longer to make sure the morning shift (aka me) has to do every fucking thing you didn't do
Also when you come back in the afternoon, make sure to tell complain about staying longer at work despite not doing anything
On birthdays and special occasions (weddings, births, awards) you bring cake or pastries or even fingerfood for the office
Hm,  if you wanted to  I could give you 100 + rock songs from Croatia, but  none of them quite have something to do with Croatia in a musical sense (and if they do chances are they aren't that popular)
The first song that comes to my mind however is [Kletva Kralja Zvonimira] (King Zvonimir's curse) from Marko Perković Thompson
It tells the legend of the curse that king Zvonimir (last croatian king from the middle ages) allegedly throwed upon his subjects and murderers who betrayed him
The main riff has a lot of similarities with traditional croatian folk songs and it keeps a very "national" vibe
Now, Thompson is a very controversial ultra right winged singer (I personally completely disagree with his views), but this song and the album in particular have nothing contoversial whatsoever and focus more on the distant croatian past

Croatia checking in
[Tomislav Horvatincic (results on Croatian)] local crook and businessman who has friends among politicians, killed older Italian couple with his boat
He basically slammed into their smaller boat while his starlet girlfriend was giving him a blowjob
He was explaining it as having syncope, rare medical condition where you pass ~~away~~ out from having too much blood in your brain
The shit happened in 2011
, he was convicted but using various loopholes he's still walking around as a free man
Oh these are not the only people he killed, there were more in late 80s but nobody gives a fuck about those poor souls right
He's typical Croatian rich idiot who does whatever he wants while government steers the looks on the other side
&#x200B;
This is just one of dozens other stories like this, no wonder young people are fleeing the country

Edit: words
Lmao when I was in Chezcia I was saying 'hvala' (how we say thank you), just assumed it was at least similar so people would understand it
Turns out it's not even close lol
It's been a while since I was in high so there's a fat chance at least something was added or removed, but aside from a whole bunch of Croatian stuff, some popular foreign stuff, in no particular order, are: Kafka's Transformation and the Trial, Poe's Murder in the Rue Morgue and Black Cat, Divine Comedy, the Decameron, Crime and Punishment, both Iliad and the Odyssey, Don Quijote, a bunch of Shakespeare's stuff including the popular Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Hamlet, some Russian stuff like Gogol's the Overcoat and Dead Souls, Anna Karenina, A Hero of Out Time etc
The Sorrows of Young Werther, Old Goriot, and there's a whole lot more than I can remember
I mean its about a dozen books each year on mandatory list and about three times as much where you have an excerpt and talk about it
Each year gets chronologically closer to modern times (starting from Illiad in first grade) with mix of foreign (mostly eutopean until 20th century) and domestic authors
We go over all of the authors listed as well, some being read in full (Zola, Moliere, Voltaire, Camus, Balzac, Flaubert, Corneille) and learn about some of them and read excerpts of texts :)
Romeo and Juliet is 8th grade of elementary school
Metamorphosis is mandatory reading in our highschools
A lot of them, besteck comes to mind first
There's also another word for that, escajg (Esszeug)
I recognize many words that are used in Croatian:
Semmel - žemlja
Krapfen - krafna
Palatschinken - palačinke
Paradeiser - paradajz
Karfiol - karfiol
Ribisel - ribiz(l)
Faschiertes - faširano
Good job remembering all these words
Do you use some form of vešmašina (Waschmaschine) or flajšmašina (Fleischmaschine)
Cutlery
How do you spell Schraube in your dialect
In my experience, it's either "paradajz" (continental) or "pomidor" (coastal), "rajčica" is used only as an "official" word (y'know, the one nobody uses but those who must :) )
Yes, we got a lot of words from Austria
Also, raj = paradise

Since me and my spouse do everyday communication over IM (messenger, hangouts, Viber, whatnot), if I get a *call*, I know it's serious, so yeah, I'd answer it, but in a hall or common room, so as not to bother colleagues
If what I'm told over the phone is serious enough to require me to leave the office, then I work those hours during the weekend to make up for the lost time
It works the other way too - if I get a call from a colleague while on day off or vacation, I expect it will be something serious enough to warrant a call, so I mentally prepare for the shitstorm and answer
Well tbf the ones singing in Zagreb are mostly tourists
Eather in Croatia, we consider it a normal thing to do
For Croatia I think the first one would be back in the middle ages when king Tomislav united the Croatian people from the coast with the people inland(lower Pannonia)
This unification made us stick together for all those centuries under different occupations and made Croatia the country it is today
Other events are probably in the 19th century with the Croatian(Illirian) rebirth period when our language,anthem and identity were re-established and of course 1848
when the whole revolution happened
Modern day event is definitely the fall of Yugoslavia and our 4-year war(1991-1995) period against Serbs in Croatia and the JNA
The establishment of Yugoslavia is also very important after WW1 and although we don't like to mention this, WW2 and the NDH period also had an influence later on with forming of our modern day state
Seems to me it is a defining moment for *the world*, not only France
It caused ripple effects across the world, and basically ushered in a new era
Sarma
But I'm not a good person to ask this, I'm a horribly picky eater
I will say heresy but I never order ćevapi in a restaurant
Few times I ordered them I realized I had made a mistake
I like normal cut of meat over grill, or if minced it has to be lamb or veil in some sauce
I eat minced meat at home but if I pay restaurant prices I won't pay for overhyped minced meat over gill served with raw onion and spoon of ajvar along side
I know a lot of people who don't like this dish, but I absolutely adore blood sausages (krvavice), especially with baked or mashed potatoes and sauerkraut
But I despise fileki or tripice (tripe in English), the smell while cooking is unbearable to me
I also hate sarma, along with grah, whenever I tell people, they go berserk
I'm not a picky eater, I just have different palate, I'll try anything once, but if I don't like the taste, then I won't eat it again, life is too short to eat food you don't like
Ćevapi isn't restaurant food, never understood it
Oh yeah, I hate grah too
But I didn't think that's a very popular food in Croatia, I mostly relate it to going to Sljeme, and old people fighting over free beans when they cook it on squares or something
The tripe thing I can agree on
But I don't get what's to hate about fish and chips haha
Depends what you wamt to try, it's diverse, you have food from parts of Croatia, parts of Montenegro, Albania and Greece that is Mediterranean in nature, then you have typical greasy, heavy food coming from continental parts of the same countries influenced by Germanic and Turkish cuisines, and in the end you have something entirely that is uniquely Balkan
Check [this list] for Croatia, it has food from all the regions, so you have light Sea food, Heavy, greasy for people from cold areas, classic continental, and everything in between
Work less and have so much free time to have a coffee with some randos and complain about the country while not working

Weird, here "luftati" means to open the windows to improve the air quality inside
I think we use "propuhati" for that use (propuh = promaja)
[Museum of broken relationships] in Zagreb, Croatia
People are donating their stuff they've got from their ex's, each item has a story that is displayed along the item itself
As much as it's interesting it's also a bit sad at the moments
Some fine but lesser known museums are
[Krapina Neandethral Museum]
[Museum of pre-historic Vučedol culture]
[Museum of Croatian Naïve art] a surprising number of tourists in Zagreb told me that they really liked it, so I always recommend it
Not really prevalent
6 restaurants in Zagreb, 1 in Zadar, 1 in Split
McDonald's is much more prevalent with its 36 restaurants countrywide
But I guess KFC is still bigger here than other US fast food chains - Burger King has 5 restaurants, Subway has 2, Domino's has only 1
No other US chains here
Poland the catholic brother, Albania the i dont get how were friends and Israel the country I wanna be friends with
I'll go with Poland
Slavs, similar historical context and we both love John Paul II
Also, they get mentioned quite often here as a country we should look up to
Conservative values and growing economy
Well, Italy (though we do share a maritime border) and Austria
Croatia - Italy
Sea border
Yay
Yes,  but Federal Republic of Serbia still didn't border Greece
Is that just beacuse of the economy or something else
Because the south always seemed more interesting and fun to me
Serbia: Visiting hometown where my family resided for 200 years before being kicked out, met some nice people there
Czech: Eh, was drunk most of my 7 day stay there, but I really loved Škoda factory and museum, had a unique opportunity to actually translate for a whole tour from English to Croatian there
Wien, Austria: Like the whole city, really reminded me of my hometown based on architecture, just much much bigger
Czech Republic: Hugging a girl I really like
Slovenia: Singing and hanging with friends is a bus
Italia: Really deep and fun conversation in Biella
Bosnia: Watching horrors with my cousin
Why if I may ask
Istria would be my answer
They have a strong sense of self-identity and are relatively rich region with few roads leading in
I was reading this and was confused about crete
Then I got to patriotic part
Also hats down to crete people
On a few occasions our national TV aired documentary about force of resistance on crete that hid australian and british naval intelligence agents
So if we buy burgenland under the idea of croatian minority living there, this means flr the first time since 10th century after hungarians settled in pannonian basin, south and west slavs would be connected
Alright slovenians, this is bigger than us both, lets merge our euros and kunas and buy it
I remember that chaos
it was all over the news
I discussed it with my friends what a beatiful fuck you to government that was
Yeah
jokes aside it's funny to me how that corridor would "correct" division from 9th century
I mean cmon it's been 1000 years
Nah, just buy it
Same
I know a few people from Croatia that went to Serbia to do volunteer work in an animal shelter, because they had so many dogs they couldn't keep up with the amount of cleaning needed (and were in dire straights when it came to food, like, all the time)
It depends
With younger kids and parties at someones home, usually parents stay and socialize
Most of the time parents know each other as well from teacher-parent or kindergarten meetings
So it is not unusual
Most parents stay for their own gathering
We have examples from all tgree main dialects in our literature and literary history, we learn specificities
As for faculty level education in specific dialects, have no idea
Cheese spread, polony and cheese (gouda)
Time to vote Monarchist
Seriously though, what is the Austrian monarchist platform anyway, aside from wanting a Habsburg restoration
I heard they gained some limited political presence
They occasionally and amusingly pop over here for a brief news interview (like, once every couple of years)
I'm not sure why they bother, but I kinda like it, makes me feel like we're still connected in a way
Anyway, last I heard of them I think they talked about gaining some seats somewhere, though I guess that was likely in some regional parliament or even some municipal council
Hah, and I'd second your sentiment about the monarchy - in theory I'd like them restored here as well, but that ain't happening, ever
And I have serious doubts about the usefulness of something like that implemented over here - I think 20 years of having a hated Serbian monarchy followed by 45 years of communism pretty much destroyed any possibility of a constitutional monarchy being practical in Croatia
That said, I always wanted to see Austria return to being a monarchy - republican Austria was always
weird to me
Just felt wrong
Theoretically they could gain a lot, but I doubt any modern republic could become a monarchy again
As for what they could gain, well that depends on what the country in question is like, regarding culture and tradition
In an ideal situation, a constitutional monarch is a living, breathing avatar of both the state and the nation, embodying centuries or millenia of history and tradition
In the right circumstances, that can be a powerful stability-enhancing tool that can reinforce political moderation, and act as stronger barrier against authoritarianism than an elected head of state can be
I could go on a lot, there are lots of theoretical benefits, but so far most of them have only truly been exploited by Europe’s wealthiest and most developed nations - I have strong doubts about how useful the introduction of such a model would be in comparatively poorer, more corruption-prone and democratically weaker countries
Switzerland, because of bunkers
Switzerland, definitely
I love their gun policy, cities and mountains
If your time is valuable to you then very very expensive
I honestly have no idea
Trains in my part of the country are shitty and extremely slow
It takes 5+ hours for 1
5h car trip or 2
5h bus trip
I think I have ridden the train in my country maybe five times in my life
A train from my city to other city around 20 ish km is 15 kuna or around 2 euro
An intracity ticket for one-way trip of 15 km is cca 1
5€. An intercity ticket for a 250 km trip is 15€.
However, there is a higher pricer you pay for taking the train here
The price of your sanity when they casually announce train is late hour and a half because *insert random reason*.
>especially since Paris has fewer inhabitants than Berlin
Paris proper just has a way narrower definition and only includes the city center
What you're referring to is Paris proper which has 2
1m people and an area of 105km2, but you're comparing it to area of 891km2 in Berlin and it's 3
7m people
It'd be more accurate to compare the greater Paris which is 814km2 and has 7

I think this is the official answer of every Croat
It is written in an old Dubrovnik dialect, sometimes in German or Italian
If the translations aren't at the bottom of the page you are officially f-ed
The story is also very dependent on the old style humor which can be a turn off for some
I found it charming more than hilarious
I found Krleža's Povratak Filipa Latinovicza (The return of Filip Latinovicz) harder to read than Dundo Maroje
Not saying renaissance Dubrovnik Croatian is easy to read, but Krleža's sentences were far too tedious and complicated, and hard for me to follow through
Even though it is very hard to read and that just makes it an automatic turn off, I still very enjoyed the story and  that it uses these characters to send a message to the Dubrovnik nobility
Another book I would put on this list is Zlatarovo zlato by August Šenoa
I despise this book and find it boring af
Is Sienkiewicz any good
My dad was a huge fan and used to tell me how he used to read *In desert and wilderness* during the siege of Sarajevo when he had the time
*Quo vadis
* is on my TBR list for a long time now
I watched the film when I was a kid
It was fun
I've never read the book
It has a huge tonal shift in the middle rivaling From Dusk Till Dawn
It is here as well
Beautiful
I can attest that huncut means the same in Croatian
As does rit
Come to think of it, also rasrđen is used, though I had to pronounce it before I could understand it
You Polish folks sure love to complicate things with all those s's and z's
Everyone kept telling me French people are rude and refuse to speak english
Every French person I met spoke english and was very polite
I agree with that and that's all true, but the reason investing and real estate is so much more popular in the US is the tax deduction and very lax tax laws
It's just more profitable and easier there, as they have some (weird and fucked up) laws that make it work flawlessly
In turn, however, that's what makes the infamous separation between upper and lower class so widespread
The rich make more profit and pay less tax and then they buy more properties/shares
Constantly, and it's really annoying
Unfortunately yes
I am ashamed of that
Yes I have forgoten for the english word (I've actually forgot the word writing this)
definitely, but good things is in Croatia basically everyone speaks English so you can without any problems do a bilingual talk, its very common in younger generation
Foreigners, what Nordic language sounds the best
It is tho, so exotic
HRT 1 which is short for "Hrvatska radiotelevizija 1" (Croatian Radiotelevision 1)
Basically new Yugoslavia including Hungary and excluding North Macedonia
Slovenia- no more border disputes, the only reasons why they dislike us
So I guess OK
Hungary- this would be silly
Atleast we would save Hungary from Orban
Bosnia- they will atleast get a more stable government, but I doubt they would be happy in Croatia
Serbia- I guess this is not that good of an idea
Probably bad idea
Montenegro- Yay
More beaches=more tourists
I think they would be OK under Rep
Of Croatia
Describe closest; it should probably be Bosnia, not so really
*nervous sweating*
Happy marriages all round
It is not our neighboring country
Without Croatia
I wouldn't mind another Austria-Hungary if it was called Austria-Hungary-Croatia
Yes, but we're not neighbouring countries
I am actually curious, how did you witness the Yugoslav war
Sometimes yes but sometimes we let them eat first then let them go play or the other way around we eat if they are playing and then they do
I Ride my bike while I wat I don't see the problem if you're hungry just eat nobofy is gonna stop you
Oh yeah sobody has to clean that up just beacouse you couldn't wait
Heard it's a thing in japan, japan is a very clean country so eating while walking is seen like you're messy
"Croats eate children"
Back from the 30-year long protestant war in Germany
Some English fuck wanted to write about it
Edit: nvm misunderstood the question but still
Bismarck supposedly said: " Croats don't know what they want, but they want it now !"
So true
So first of all you got the digits1 - jedan, 2 - dva, 3 - tri, 4 -četiri, 5 - pet, 6 - šest, 7 - sedam, 8 - osam, 9 - devet and 0 - nula
Then from 10 - 20 is the (digit number) + deset (word for 10)20, 30, 40 etc
are in the same vain (digit name) + desetNon whole tens are pretty simple as well
Just (the name of the ten) + i (and in Serbo-Croatian) + (digit)
And all the numbers are done in this way
EDIT: Forgot to add, these are all normally said in a very slurred manner, like the rest of our language, unless you're in Croatian class lol
It is basic declension
The "fun" stuff about inflection languages
Wait, wait, wait
Slovenians have the German system of 20s and so on
Why
I always thought you were like any other Slavs
guess Austrians have influenced Slovenia A LOT
You live and learn each day
Cool
>Forgot to add, these are all normally said in a very slurred manner, like the rest of our language, unless you're in Croatian class lol
Yeah hahah like *"Dvadeset"* (20) becomes *"dvaest"* or *"dvajst"*.
In Croatian it is the 5th that is different
So:
-1 pas, 2 psa, 3 psa, 4 psa, 5 p**a**sa, etc
Yeah
At least they are not bad
just
weird
Lol But Slovenia can still into Slav
Good boi Slovenia
I think the conclusion here is that all Slavic langauhes are VERY similar
Most of the old rules are present in every Slavic language in some form
God, I love Slavic languages and our culture hahaha
My town has an old abandoned military base
It was used during Yugoslavia and abandoned after independence as military shrunk
It consists of several buildings for housing soldiers, staff and administration and several hangars used for ammunition and military hardware storage
For a decade and a half it's been abandoned and decaying
Lately, however, the city has decided to repurpose it for several new uses instead of letting it rot
A very smart move welcomed by citizens
Nowadays, most of it has been refurbished and renovated
There are couple of small private firms operating there, our police station and firefighters have been transfered there from their old locations in packed city centre
There is a kindergarden, public garden where citizens can plant their veggies, dog park and, best of all, local youth centre, which now hosts numerous social events and serves as a hub for teenagers going out
All of that is build on top of old military buildings and hangars
My hometown's barracks got taken over by a bunch of local rascals during Yugoslav Wars and repurposed as a concert hall for punk rockers lol

They were huge here 10-15 years ago but people probably have no idea they're German
Everyone knows 'everytime we touch'
Not only DOTA players, there wasn't a teenager in my neighbourhood in 2009/10 who didn't have 'all i ever wanted', 'boten anna' and 'now you're gone' on their phone
I'm not saying her music is good though :D
I was also surprised when some of her songs had 300+ million views on youtube
Here, it’s generally accepted you say “Bok” (a greeting) to someone if you’re passing them, with not many other people in sight
I came to exchange in france
It is not obligatory (but also not frowned upon) to greet upon entering the bus
So I got stopped by the driver several times for not saying hi and had to explain myself in my rudimentary french (and figure out why im being singled out in the first place)
Now am back home and still always greet the driver
Surogat (The substitute) is as far as I know the only croatian movie/ cartoon that won an Oscar
I would highly recommend you watch it, it's acutally kind of "deep".
[They don't speak at all, so anyone can watch it
Also, it's quite short, only 10 minutes
I recommend [Čudesna šuma] one of my favourites while growing up
Its a awsome cartoon it was translated in croatian
A je to is one of my all time favourite
Still have dvds of it
if I go to Bosnia and say "Burek sa sirom"
Bulja ( sleng ) means head in Croatia, but ass in Serbia
A lot of our swears have "fucking" included, so if you say "Jebem te u bulju" you'll say "I'm fucking you in your head" in Croatian, but "I'm fuckin' you in the ass" in Serbian
Stupid example, but  "okrenuti" (to turn around) means something different in Montenegrin than it does in Croatian
In Montenegrin in means "to dial" or call (like how you would have to turn the dial wheel around on those old phones) while in Croatian is a slang meaning to fuck someone
&#x200B;
You can imagine my Montenigrin friend getting some very upset reactions from Croatian girls when he asked for a number so he can "turn them around".
Also in Bulgarian "karam" means "I am driving" whereas in Serbo-Croatian it means "I am fucking".
This guy even made a song regarding this translation issue
Hladno piće? Cold drink
Hladna pička would be like a disinterested chick (acting cold)
Hladna pića* - cold beverage in Serbo-Croatian but hungry pussy in Czech and Slovak
Something is off lol
Pička and piće are quite diff but I can only speak for my own language
I know like three people that have a beard (and one of them is a celebrity)
I wouldn't say it is popular, but it isn't unusual to see beards either
I would say that a stubble is much more common to see than a full grown beard
Especially the really long ones, no one has that
But moustaches were popular in some region like 50 years ago
I know that surgeons most of the times are not allowed to have a beard
Is it a problem for veterinary worker aswell do you need to have something to cover or are there no problems at all
Well, we usually suck at qualifying and surprise at the msin tournaments
Passing the group is expected, everything else is a bonus, especially with our current form and game
Not so good
Our manager is so poor in replacing retired players with new generation of kids
We have good players, but the manager is just doing bad job
On the other hand, we ended up woth world silver last time with no game and maybe 1 and a half good match played
Portuguese, i like the specific  expressiveness mixed with the calm of the language
Hebrew, (European) Spanish and for some weird reason, Latvian
Outside or inside of my own, the answer is the same
I really don't like hearing croatian when i go somewhere
I didn't travel to another country to hang out with croats, i can do that back home
The answer would probably be icelandic and maybe french for women because it sounds really sexy
Also serbian, i like women speaking serbian
Napoleon in Croatia is viewed very positively, at least in Dalmatia
His generals built roads, schools and the French published the first Croatian newspaper in Zadar (even though it was bilingual and in Italian as well)
The main shopping street in old town Split is even named after a general, August Marmont
Josip Broz Tito is badly viewed in Croatia and Serbia but the Bosnians think he was a good man the other ex yugoslav countries are neutral of him
Sometimes I feel whenever we answer questions like these, we raise everything to another level
Rest of the world: Yeah, we had some minor skirmishes and fought over this regions/resource, it was horrible, hope it never happens again
Balkan: Hold my rakia
It's same for us for yours Lajos Kossuth and Khuen Hedervary
They're positively viewed in Hungary but are viewed as oppressive tyrants in Croatia
Thank god everything is left in history now and we're not as bitter towards you as we were 150 years ago :)
Funny, there is also a story that a saying exists from 30 years war that goes along these lines "God save us from plague, famine and Croats", according to some it was engraved somewhere in Aachen after the sacking of Magdeburg
I can't remember the details at the moment but hungary, if I remember correctly, wanted Croatia to become hungary
They pushed for hungarian as a necessary language in school, on street signs and on buildings
There was more stuff like that just trying to make us hungarians
Hedervary was more extreme in this than Kossuth as far as I remember but if you want I can go look through my papers to see what exactly they did, or someone who knows the details can correct me
Aside from technical jargon, english is not really used in everyday talk (even if english words are introduced, they are "croatized" and adapted eg we created frend for male and frendica as female friend from original english unisex friend)
Literature goes on in croatian, everyday communication goes on
Life goes on
I am more worried about regional (and subregional) accents and dialects
Yes, Croatian is already dying out and I believe that it will be replaced by English or that it will be heavily Anglicized
if serbocroatian does dissapear it will be because of decresing populations and the fact some immigrants dont teach their children to speak serbocroatiam not becuse of english
They're very forgotten, but I wouldn't expect them to be very known because next to nothing is known about them
I realized it's related to our "Bećar", a traditional Slavonian archetype of someone who is cheery and goes around pubs a lot (often, but not necessarily unmarried)
I find the migrant crisis to be one of the worst things that has happened to Europe
Not so much because of the migrants but due to the rapid rise of right-wing populism and to be honest, it worries me quite a lot
It's true for both
I read somewhere that Heavy speaks/uses words that are pretty formal and eloquent, so that's pretty nice, since he's always portrayed as an idiot
And another fun fact, I'm pretty sure they gave Spy a parisian accent in the french dub, to kinda emphasise his snobishness
1 in the capital and in the other 3 big cities there are those small centres with furniture so when you order it doesn't have to come from Zagreb
One in Zagreb
1 in Zagreb
And I think a couple in Hungary
1 for Croatia
1 ikea store in capital city
Only 1 in Zagreb
Balkan, definetly Balkan here in eastern Croatia(Slavonia)
Other parts of Croatia differ, as northern Croats are very much central Europe and Dalmatians are southern
West Croats I would say they are central as well
Then again you have parts of middle Croatia that I would put in Balkan
So I would say we are Central-Southern Europe and Balkan
In Croatia we were taught in primary school geography that Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltics were Northern Europe
East for us begins at Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine
Hey
You're as Balkan as everybody
(However, for the tiny price of calling Croatia Central Europe
Well that would make Croatia and Bosnia central Europe
He's joking, Montenegro is obviously a part of northern Africa
... Yugoslavia established the Non-aligned movement
It wasn't part of either side
Let's make it a century of rule, and the bureks are out
Always
> In Romania it is considered rude to ask your guest to take them off
Same in Croatia
It also kind of depends how good do you know the person
The less you know the person, the less chance that the guest will be asked to take off their shoes
(I just want to note that I'm speaking from my experience
Probably "U boj, boj":
i don't think i know anyone who knows the lyircs from this song
i know that this is the first time i hear it mentioned somewhere outside of school and first time i'm hearing it
but i guess i'll take this one over thompson any day
>mein Vaterland muss größer sein
No, it shouldn't you mfing warmonger
It's the year 2452
Most of the world was destroyed and became uninhabitable except the British Isles
The continent is swarming with radioactive monsters, but our country constantly sends someone to the continent
Nobody knows why, not even those who send them
All we know is that it became a tradition before the destruction
I would disagree, Slavonia is similar to Vojvodina, but different from the rest of Serbia (as is Vojvodina(. Montenegro si similar to Dalmatia but different from the rest of Croatia
Bosnia is just a mess but culturally I don't feel any connection with it, especially not as I am Zagorje born and Istria raised
Can you be more christian than italy
I know when my sister played volleyball there and i went to pick her up she warned me that under no circumstances i was to say "porco dio" even as a joke because you italians dont porco your dio and people might get angry
Isto
Astronomical taxes, rising crime and Denmark
A lot of Pizza and Kebab
Also if its foreign the mighty Ćevapi
Cevapi are roasted minced meat "fingers" put in a lepinja (like a flat bread) often served with onions and ajvar
I personally really enjoy them and my favourite Cevapi place is Hrga grill
Ajvar is a hot sauce
*Rakije, rakije amo jer utjehe nema u vodi
"[Bring] [rakija] rakija over here, for there is no solace in water
A pretty popular one would be “Čovječe, pazi da ne ideš malen ispod zvijezda
” Meaning “Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man
” It sounds so much better in Croatian, I must say
It’s from a poem Opomena (“Warning”) by Antun Branko Šimić.
I never would’ve guessed that we would build a rivalry with England
Are there any more odd rivalries like that
Pretty excited for our group
Hopefully serbia qualifies, that will make the group even more interesting
And hopefully not too many die in the fights in and around the stadium
Don’t worry you won’t come first
I'm getting real tired of playing against you
Something something costa rica in 2014 WC
I dont think it has a name
Im not sure what i would call it

Kebab dude
april Anno Domini 1776 some serf known as Jakob Verček was carrrying water in a bucket around the city of Varaždin
As he had a bad toothache, he was smoking a cigarette thinking it would help him
The bucket he took was previously used to feed pigs
One of the pigs saw the bucket and started chasing Jakub
Jakub ran to the local barn and jumped in the hay trying to escape
Cigarette fell into the hay, half of the city burned, and the capital had to be moved
It was moved to Zagreb (yea, not Dubrovnik as many of my American friends would think)
The previous capital was Varaždin
It, unfortinately, burned down in a fire and the capital moved to Zagreb
Varaždin was later completly rebuilt in the barouqe style, and it is now famous because of that
Yeah and they planned on moving it back but I guess they never bothered and Zagreb is definitely in a better location unlike Dubrovnik lmao
Dubrovnik as an independent city-state at a time
Republic of Ragusa ceased to exist in 1808 after Napoleon joined it's administative territory with dalmatian
This is how Dubrovnik was united with Croatia
Edit: Dubrovnik was also a first country to recognize US indepedence
Kind of weird because we used to live together for a long time
You can say:
- *Boli me kurac - My dick hurts*
- *Boli me Briga - My worries hurt*
- *(Ne) Briga me - I worry (not is implied)*
- *Ma zaboli me - It hurts me*
- *Boli me dupe - My butt hurts*
- *Jebe mi se - I feel like fucking*
- *Svejedno mi je - It's all the same to me*
And now you can play with those phrases and their word order or add stuff to it
all in all, quite a few options to say I don't care without saying the exact words
briga me = sarcastic "i care"
nije me briga = i dont care (no sarcasm)
boli me kurac = my dick hurts
moš' mislit = im not sure this is even translateable
"lest you entertain the thought"? literally it is "(you) may think"
jebe mi se = "(this) makes me wanna fuck
In Croatian, we have "Zaboli me" which roughly translates to "It hurts me". It's basically a more vulgar way of saying "I don't care".
"Boli me kurac" or "Boli me kita" Both mean "My [reproductive organ] hurts
Kurac is pp, kita is vagane, both vulgar
That's because we don't care how we say it ;)
"mi" means "to me" and "se" is a form of the word "is".
The literally translation is: "Fucks to me""
Edit: You can put any verb instead of "jebe" on that place and it will translate to the: "I feel like *insert the verb*"
Example:
- *Radi mi se - I feel like working*
- *Spava mi se - I feel like sleeping*
- *Trči mi se - I feel like running
... etc
People might not know this but Dubrovnik, Croatia was actually Kings Landing from the popular tv show called Game of Seats or something like that
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think we had the longest European continuous lasting state/country entity from (before) 835
until 1918
going by the name Duchy, later Kingdom of Croatia
We're one of the leading countries in the world regarding organ transplants
Croatia is number one in kidney transplants
We have the world’s smallest town
Croatia also has the highest number of UNESCO Intangible Goods of any European country together with Spain
We also gave you a place to film GoT, Star Wars, and many other movies and TV shows, the tie, torpedo, mechanical pencil, fingerprinting, rice chocolate, the Dalmatian and the Croatian shepherd
You’re welcome
Biggest neandertal findings are in a place called Krapina
Smallest town on earth is called Hum (less then 20 population)
Longest fortification system in the world after the Chinese Great wall is in Ston
(5,5 km long)
Oldest city in Europe is in Croatia
People enhibited the city of Vinkovci for 8000 years
(It was probably not called that through it's whole history
I'm pretty confused right now
Until the last photo from the dude who replied below
Heh
Croatia too
I mean, same here
I'm not really sure about that
Any proof
For chicago to be "polish" city in its loose sense it needs to have polish majority
What you meant to say is the city with highest population of poles after warsaw
In Croatia too

Yes because Serbia is not and will not be in NATO
Are we ignoring the fact of Milosevic war crimes in Kosovo
>Western countries didn't care about the lack of universal support for the declaration of independence and still accepted it
Your country was one of the first to recongize Kosovo
Spain is a unitary country and some random region can't just decide to opt out of the country because they don't like paying taxes
It's not like it's a case of ethnic oppression, ethnic Catalans are a minority in Catalonia due to decades of migration from other regions of Spain, it's just a case of uppity rich people not wanting to give money to the rest of the country
And also it's not even clear that there's a majority support for independence in the first place since all the people against independence didn't vote as they agreed with the government stance that the vote is illegitimate
Turnout was only 43% on the last referendum
Because other comment explained they dont want to lose big allies if they support Catalonia they lose spain
It's dumb to talk about it as if it's some foreign thing that has nothing to do with you
Germans and French: "Thanks, we'll pass this time
Signorina was actually lent into Croatian (in Dalmatia) with the same meaning and it's still used among older population just meaning Miss, younger woman, when refering to a stranger
So I guess Croatians coming to Italy like to flex their knowledge of Italian which actually just constitutes of all the Italian loanwords in Dalmatian dialect
*trying to fit in*
How do you do, fellow cunts
There isn't really a specific pattern
Only thing that happens a lot is that people get nicknames based on their surname rather than their name
Not me tho :(
My god, such a badass language and badass names
Worth mentioning that we usually (at least in my experience) use surnames to create nicknames
I know a bunch of people named Dugi, Mrki, Crni, etc
just because they have similar surnames
Also, those are all male names, women usually don't get a nickname via their surname, don't know why tho
To give you an example, Modrić would be Modri, Šuker would be Šuki, etc
But at the same time Davor Šuker could be Dado, there are no rules in choosing between the name or the surname, it just depends what the kids start using when you're young and that one usually sticks
Sweet, means my family will be forced to start using other shit to communicate online with me and i never have to use facebook ever again
Call their bluff
Oh no whatever will we do
YES PLEASE
oh god yes please
please make facebook leave forever
what's wrong with facebook
Now we need for Twitter to do the same
Nice
This and Twitter, maybe reddit is next
Mesanger is only reason I didnt deleted my account already
Lol exactly
Nobody really uses FB that much anymore
I would love it if Europeans made their own version, where privacy would actually mean something
Seriously FB can fuck off
You are not much better, UK
I love when I argue with republicans /Democrats on the Internet, trying to explain to them that Conservative /Liberal is not the only way to differ parties, and then they all go sWeEtIe, uR wRoNg, i hAvE fAcTs while theyre just a bunch of 16 year olds like go away and Learn that Europe isn't a country
This is the gravest insult to the czechs i have ever witnessed
Oh look
GERMAN HUMOUR
Basically: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it
" Great show of statesmanship
Personally, I think these cartoons are insulting and that, as a society, we should see than as a negative thing
However, we should always give people the right to do these things, because if you take it away who gets to decide what can and can't be criticizes and satirized
So while I am against the cartoons, i don't think things like that should be banned
I completely agree with what he said and it is really common sense
But this argument is also something that can be used by shitty people that want (e.g.) Nazi stuff in public
In France, it is illegal to display Nazi flags, uniforms and insignia in public, unless for the purpose of a historical film, show, filmmaking or spectacle
Not sure I completely understand the resolution, what does it exactly standardize
The port on the mobile phones
The port on the outlet / charger
Charging standard (USB-PD / DASH charge / etc)

Such comments and speculations should be avoided, especially if they clearly violate our rules
Thanks for being voice of reason
It's horrible enough that we are losing one of architectural and history jewels of Europe right in front of our eyes
I am pretty emotional here too
It survived eight centuries only for our generation to see it burn
I cannot help but feel a bit of guilt and responsibility
But playing the blame game with knowing very little facts is just going to deepen the hate and division
We'll find out what happened eventually
Now let's just hope everyone makes it out alive and unharmed
And they can save as much as possible
The roof and interior were mostly wood
~~Not sure, but it seems that its only the "attic" area that is on fire for now
Catastrophic in either case
Edit: Apparently the fall of the spire spread the fire to the entire interior
Yeah, it took me by surprise too
800+ years of skill, vision and architectural prowess of human race, up in smoke, and some nimrods are laughing about it

First one is climate, an average
That means over whole year (including winter and summer) average temperature is X.
Second picture is weather, state of atmosphere at certain point
Usually averaged over a day, or certain part of the day
How on Earth did you not make meme reference to Asterix & Obelix out of the second picture
This Brexit thing is going too far
Ah wonderful

Also a surefire way to trigger Serbs is to claim that Tesla was Croatian

Seems the further away you were from the Soviets and Ottomans the better things worked out
I mean, yes but Balkans also sometimes beat the west in some things too
For some reason "worrying results" sounds much worse than "bad results" to me
Some things that nobody wants to be the best at
What about quality of life
Unfortunately we don't beat them in that
Afaik, they haven't really changed their mind
The polls are again showing very narrow margins
The problem is that if the new referendum goes like this the losing side cam ask for another one with equal right
And Johnson, a prominent member of Vote Leave, resigned as Foreign Secretary in order to work for his country where it matters, the side lines

Fear the Belarus pan
That would make Swedes the majority
I mean, the restaurants sell food
The US government sent grain shipments to the USSR simply because it was the right thing to do (and it was a propaganda win) so I genuinely don't see the issue here
Even though they somehow morphed into a quasi symbol of US style capitalism, they're a restaurant
They sell food
It's not exactly a political statement
This isn't a tech company helping a totalitarian regime or even a clothing company using their cheap labor
It's just a restaurant
Their food isn't healthy, but it's safe
McDonalds has standards that in my experience don't change from country to county and provides a consistent product that, while not as cheap elsewhere as it is in the US, is still decent and affordable
You can fault them for a lot of things, but opening up locations in places where people could realllly use some comfort food is absolutely not one of them
In the US, not in in the USSR
Real Estate is a cornerstone of their business but it's not as big outside the States and virtually nonexistent in the East block
They were and still are just a restaurant there
Im proud of this comunity

When the smoking ban hit our country, some tv reporters found a surgeon on a smoking break in the hospital general area

Good ole' gerrymandering, the official voting system of the GOP since 1854
Donald Dumb:
>“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr
John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true
— but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought
— but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible
I love how Trump is making me love my Europeans even more
First it was Sweden, now Denmark
Fairly sure this guys thick boneheaded attitude is the only thing that could fix the relations of countries in the Balkans
>Look, having nuclear

r/russia is a pro-Putin sub
I think one should be careful to consider it as representative of Russia
Elections are rigged, but even people that voted for Putin could detest the injustice and assassination threat that Navalny is facing
Reddit is so quick and easy to jump to conclussions
A single person posts this photo on which it (perfectly undisputably) *seems* that another individual is doing the Nazi salute, proceeds to with certainty label it as what the title is, and **literally everybody** jumps on the bandwagon
This is just bullshit lol
You are a patriot when you fight for your country
I doubt that this guy or majority of this sub would do that
Bist du retarded

Reddit is conservative as hell
They/we are praising USA/capitalism that killed more than 400 milion
There is a theory that Britain killed more than billion people in India with capitalism
You don't know it's true, it's a lie to claim that
Prejudices and presumptiveness are just that
Please look at my flair
It disgusts me hearing people talk about how great our Nazi collaborators were
Buncha dumb fucks
>It's the anxiety, frustration, lack of opportunities and defeatist attitude that pushes them into these radical beliefs, inceldom or similar and all as a result of the way modernization changed human interaction for the worse
What's worse is that people make fun of them and degrade them, insult them which in turn makes them hunker down on their beliefs, makes them blind to their ideology and makes them hostile to the rest of the community
Same thing with criminals, if no one wants to hire them and give them a chance they will most likely return to crime because they don't have other options
Some will turn a new leaf but for others it's too hard

Doesn't even need to be especially high speed
Just cheap and comfortable
Have a few hubs that the bullet trains ride between, have nice, big comfortable, but not especially fast trains that that connect the countryside with the hubs
Make it as easy as possible to transport large amount of luggage, both on the train, but also, when switching between trains by offering baggage trolleys
Make buying tickets via app quick and easy
Have a standardized system of using colored stripes on the floor where each color always corresponds to the same Platform number (1 is always red, 2 is always blue) and make the number and color very obvious on the ticket
In my experience, price and ease of travel frequently outweigh speed when considering the mode of transportation
It has improved for me
I mean
personally
for me it stayed the same
it's not like I was surprised by your president
Croatian: Worsened (because of the "black lives matter" riots, not the covid-19 situation)
That is not multiculturalism, tho, it is multilateral international action
Also all these people are westerners and as such have a lot in common
There isnt a huge difference between Dutch and Canadian culture
Cooperating despite differences is a lot harder when cultures are very different from each other and it introduces problems that didnt exist before
Whatever good is created has to be greater than those negatives in order to be justified and I dont see much extra value being produced by multiculturalism of the kind we see in UK, France, Belgium
You lose some social cohesion, have to have arguments about free speech, secularism, womens rights and gay rights all over again and for what
Better choice of restaurants
More exotic entertainment
Meeting interesting people
Not to mention that dealing with negative aspects of multiculturalism sucks out the oxygen from public discourse from other topics society needs to address
Seems like a bad deal
I wouldn't rejoice, his opposition is Serbian nationalists
Lmao Croatian party got like 0,1%

Who's gonna be Napoleon 2
I would genuinely like if this idea got more traction, so I'll share wherever I can
The optimal solution for Scotland in the short term is to demand the N. Ireland deal
Both N. Ireland and Scotland voted to stay in the EU and Scotland had previously voted to stay in the UK
The deal effectively has it both ways
If then Scotland decides to vote for independence, the N. Ireland deal is the best transitory state before leaving the UK
If however, Scotland votes to stay again, it would still maintain access to the EU market and many of the rights enjoyed by EU citizens
Let the places that wanted to leave, fully leave, but as it's obviously possible to have it both ways, I see no reason why Scotland should be put in a worse position than N. ireland
We're gonnae miss you
Nobody leaving lights for N. Ireland though
The EU didn't do this tho
It was some Scottish party
Yes
It's exceptionally easy and seamless
They can do it electronically
Your own government said as much
No matter the individual, pepper spraying them is not right when it wasn't the right thing to do (and there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for the officer to have sprayed her), regardless of what they do for a living

UK is testing close to 10,000 every day if you have symptoms - I think they're doing well
Also Italy seems to be pretty on top of testing now
Somebody hasn't checked the news lately
You can also just google 'UK to test 10,000 people per day'.
They haven't been testing 10,000 every day for long, just since the last few days
Still, they've tested the second most in Europe (behind Italy) and have tested more per capita than the majority of European countries (I think they're 4th or 5th for that)
The UK strategy also isn't to get 60% of the people infected, that's just something that keeps getting bandied around the subreddit
Bruh why is this on r/europe lmao
So, we're back to a regular insanity dosage as of January

I don't want my son living in hell 50 years from now
Not being in denial of it is already a massive step in the right direction
For the clueless: Our President and our PM are from opposing political parties
Our President, Milanović, is from Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is centre-left, and our PM, Plenkoivić, is from the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which is centre-right
I  have a couple of Slovenian friends, lately all I see from their timelines is them commenting on Janša's pictures to piss off and that he's a conman lol
That's absolutely true, but it is still a lot nearer to a solution than outright denying the science
There is some kind of a chance now
I'm talking about my son, who exists, not a metaphor for the future
I mean yeah, I'll probably live to see some shit too, but I'll be on my way out by then, he will be in what are supposed to be his best years
Of course :)
I've seen enough of these around too :)
OK, I agree there
I misspoke if I left that impression
Its not funny mocking a disabled person
at the time I was working in the middle east for a major IT corporation from the USA, 90%+ of employees that were muslims were actually supportive and/or with the what did they expect (approving tone) attitude for those killings
Those were thoughts of a highly educated/moderate muslims working for western company
What is bullshit
Their thinking or my writeup
I was living 10 years in the middle east and my sources are muslim colleagues / friends / strangers that directly shared their thoughts with me + semi regular lecturing about the world that should be lived and experienced as quran dictates
Damn this must be at least 50+ k
what kind of flags are those
It's just not gonna end well, Russia's influence there is too high and the country it self has next to no allies, it's pretty much free real a state for Putin to use any excuse, even the weakest to take the country when Lukashenko completely fails to hold onto his power
This might be a far worse situation than even Ukraine, it won't just be a part that'll be occupied but the whole country will be possibly likely taken
EU will just do it's usual sanction thing,write an angry letter and then do not much else while US will do nothing at all due to the current president
Wow, this surely must be the end of Lukashenko
This simply can not be ignored

Croatians are mostly poor (compared to you) but live in a beautiful country with amazing, well-preserved nature

when did they took it to build wooden boats
In the UK, tree cover was down to about 10% by the late middle ages
Most of the wood used for its navy (1500s on) came from the baltic region

It comes off as a bit jarring when you have such a high profile opening with "women need not apply" or "men need no apply" plastered all over it
And even if it were
Why would you ever aim for 50/50
If you want to remove gender bias by blanking out names or other means, that's perfectly fine
If you want to create a quantifiable test that eliminates subjectivity, that's fine too
If you however decide to force equality in any unequal field you will be denying more qualified candidates because they don't fir in to a specific demographic, aka one of the big reason people didn't like the concept of aristocracy, because what you're born as was more important than what you could do
It's not only terribly unfair, it's outright stupid for the exact same reason flat out stopping women from doing certain jobs was stupid
/r/europe has posts on top of r/all all the time, this is nothing new
a) you are grossly underestimating the power of spite
b) they don't actually have to
The union can be purely on paper, leaving both parties as nothing more than two neighbouring EU members
I see somebody was watching House of Cards
Remember the world cup
Not underestimating others simply isn't in your DNA
But of course you never did play France, which is strange given the hours upon hours spent analysing the inevitable UK v France final, the night before playing and losing against Croatia

Wow so many approve of physically attacking him for making a hand gesture
I can see why it is seen as distasteful but there was no need to beat the guy
It kinda distorts the line between Nazis and those that claim to be anti-nazis, both go after violence and it's just a never ending circle of fighting, Germany has laws against such things, it should be left to the authorities to sanction the guy
IDK maybe he was ignorant about the differences between US and German laws when it comes to expressing yourself joke or not
Biggest military embarrassment since the Suez crisis
There is a Stalinist party
In Croatia we've got two, always one of them wins and then there's smaller parties who just get absorbed and do drama if possible (eg one party not getting enough votes and all so then mini parties go all patriotic and shit just to turn out to be a bunch of money hungry retards who do complete opposite of they promised the people to do etc, we even had one "new" party one elections, upon realizing they have actual chance to influence the outcome of elections their dumbfuck leader went to sign a public document stating they aren't going to be bought by croatian democratic party and that they will do everything that interests Croatia as a country only, to form a government with said party a week later, the same government that turned out to be the most embarrassing group of retards Croatia has ever saw, and trust me, we get out yearly dose of retards in bulk)
But it's okay, I like to think I live in this political sitcom universe and all will be good

There's no doubt a reform is needed but this solution is imposed by the creative industry
You can't fix 1 thing by breaking 5 others
Since you have looked into them, could you just list good things about this proposal
What are the needed reforms that this proposal addresses
Platforms that host content often take most of the commercial spoils while artists get little
It's a problem that has to be solved somehow
I don't know what the solution is by I know creative industry pushing legislation that would destroy sharing platforms is not the solution
It could go both ways tbh
I'll try to refrain from being salty, good game
OOTL
Pfff this shouldn't be on r/europe
This should be on r/africa
Nothing to be salty about
Thrilling game, Croatia played really well for one part of the game, France really well for the other part of the game, and in the end they won fair and square
I'm glad for France, but I'm also glad for us
Just look at the unity it brought to us, as well as the world's spotlight on us
It's fantastic
The prize REALLY IS the friends we made along the way
Because almost all of the Frances top players are from Africa and all Croatias players are true Croats
Still it was a great game but I think that first foul on Griezman should not have been called :/
And this shit, right here, just shows the extent of belligerent narcissism of Donald Trump
This is why the world prays for him not to get re-elected
When it comes to domestic policies, that's America's issue
But just try to picture how much of a mess he can cause on a global scale, and this insane, greedy behavior is what we all fear
He doesn't care about how bad the pandemic is, how many people will die, or how many world countries will suffer socioeconomicallly from the outbreak
He only cares about himself and how much he can profit from this
I recall one of his presidential rallies when he said, and I quote: "The world is laughing at us, folks
But they won't laugh no more
" In a way, he was right: We were laughing at the idea of the sheer insanity that he could possibly become President
But we aren't laughing anymore
We are afraid
Afraid of how many innocent people just trying to live their lives and having no connection to him, or the US, that would suffer if this happened
It's not funny anymore
And then the police stormed in and arrested at least a hundered of them
pretty much the same thing happened with japan
china put some war criminals to trial and then america made all that stop because they needed an ally in the pacific because the cold war started
and now even to this day it's pretty much political suicide for any japanese politician to condemn or even acknowledge japanese war crimes
they even have shrines for their "heroes" and pm's pay homage there
like some of the guys that were meant to be put on trial were in the same category of prisoner as the nazi top brass
it's kinda fucked that only germany made a solid effort to de-nazify and every other axis power large or small just kinda slipped by under the radar with minimal changes, even keeping a lot of the same people in power

On this day 80 years ago Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
That's why today we mark the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
It is also known in some countries as *Black Ribbon Day*.
Why is it called Stalinism
I thought it was just Communism
Or did Stalin do something special
( Is it just the sending of people to the Gulag
TIL Nazi Germany had non-aggresion pacts with dozen countries including Poland and Czechoslovakia
The USSR was actually the last country to sign it, also USSR wanted to form anti-Hitler pact in the early 30s but western european countries refused that
In some countries the day is actually commemorated as The European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of All Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes
I guess the EP didn't want to anger the leftists so they left out the word communism
I agree with your point but I wanted to post the official name in the title, not my own
Because they had to spread revolution across the  whole world which isnt really easy
That's right, also in [Slovenia] and [Croatia]
Northern Croatia was hit by a 5
3 earthquake minutes ago, Zagreb cathedral seriously damaged
Images:
Hospitals in Zagreb:
EDIT :: first reports of injuries are coming in
EDIT 2 :: one 15 year dead in building collapse
EDIT 3 :: doctors are trying to save the life of 15 year old that was reported dead, let's hope they succeed
I froze in my bed, I was scared shitless
Heard my someone screaming my name and I didn't move until it was done
I have no idea what to say
Whoever is writing the script for 2020 can kindly fuck off
I've experienced a few quakes but this was something else, motherfucker moved the *furniture*!
I just felt a new one in Varaždin, weaker, but it rocked the building
I woke up to my room violently shaking and everything falling down around me
I hope this is it and not a foreshock
Our building shook so fucking hard, it was literally going like 10 degrees in every direction
Only good thing about this is that I tested my reflexes
I managed to wake my SO, grab the dog and cat, run out and on the way check for damages
&#x200B;
But yeah, this sucks
Meteor, Corona and now earthquake
I'm betting on aliens next
I overslept thinking it was a dream
THE END IS NEAR
And now a third
I was never so scared in my life
Great, now they're gonna keep rebuilding it for another 100 years
It was actually 5
5, that's what our own institute has measured
I just start eating my burek and than this shit happened
Im just happy that my family is ok and hause is still ok as well but lots of people lost their home today
lucy us that this was only 5
5 strong
TUDUDUDUDU, NEMA NAM POMOCIIIIII
I was at the border of the earthquake so I just felt it a little bit
The most damage by me is some broken glass that fell of the shelfs
When I first heard the glass break I was so scared I thought someone broke into my house
In the moment when eartquake hit, my only thought was “ok
this is the end”
Da ja zivim u Zagrebu i ovo je jako, jako lose
Women’s hospital was badly hit
Mothers in their night dresses and slippers where outside holding their newborns
Women that have to have birth were put in the cars
Tfw you live in Split and it could probably also hit here since the effects of the earthquake are spreading
Yes they say that one stronger earthquake will come in an hour
Ljudi pazite se
I felt it in Varaždin
Whole fucking building moving under my feet
At least we're not bored, eh
Yeah, old buildings are the biggest problem
Newer ones (even after WWII) didn't sustain damage
We had 5 years of war, so we will be fine, but fuck my luck
Born in communism, 5 years of war in 1990's, great depression, covid19 pandemic and now earthquake
Please let me know where you're moving next if you ever decide to leave Italy

Meanwhile, that sanctimonious bitch had a shotgun wedding because she got knocked up
Hypocritical cow
Outside and fricking cold
Temperature dropped to 4°C from yesterday's ~20°C.
I just hope these people never experience serious damage
Many dead, tens of thousands with no place to live
Strongest one in 140 years
wtf is your problem
Same here in Varaždin
EDIT:: second one is 5
0, first was 5
You can see some scaffolding in the picture ... Zagreb started to repair buildings lately, but there are still a lot that are in pretty bad shape
Jeeej
And another
0 for the second as reported on jutarnji
Yeah man i wish it stayed warm
Pa no, na kraju dana, ono sto zaista ubije covjeka je dosada
Well that's kinda weird, in my dream some guy or girl said (most probably guy) quote: "My least favorite part about it
is the earthquake hallucinations" or something like that
So when I woke up I legit thought I was still dreaming
Maybe it's like a coping mechanism for the shock of the experience beforehand

You don't win war only on land, you need to win in on all 3 fronts and western allies only did it
When Germany invaded Soviet Union, Soviets practically didn't have anything
Germans destroyed most of the Soviet air-force, infantry and tanks didn't have ammunition, there was no food, trucks, etc
Soviet also had fuel shortage after they destroyed oil fields in Caucasus region
With Lend Lease the got massive amount of materials from airplanes and ammunition to locomotives, wagons and food which help them to hold back Germans and reorganized
Soviets had huge losses because civilians died working in inhuman conditions the Ural Mountains and generals having same tactic, rush with huge amount of troops
Don't forget that commissars shoot any retreating soldier
The Soviet Union created another 50 years or dictatorship and economic hardship while the US and the UK brought freedom, democracy and capitalism to Western Europe crating the most peaceful time in human history
The USSR could have defeated Germany on their own
It would have taken 3 more years and cost millions more lives
Europe would fall into a communist dictatorship likely lasting longer than in out world
And the US could have defeated Germany on their own
It would have also lasted 3 more years and cost millions more lives
The Marshall plan would never have been implemented and Europe would experience a massive economic depression and would likely never recover
It sure isn't UK

Imagine a parking lot where there are 50ish cars and a high end Mercedes or BMW is the least expensive thing there
Now imagine that nobody cares, because these aren't rich people cars, they're just cars and the owner of the Porsche doesn't feel like driving so they decide to take their bike or even the tram to work
You just lose any and all sense of perspective of what it means to be rich
The rest of the world doesn't exist
Your absolute wealth doesn't matter, because you're only comparing yourself to the guy with the Ferrari and your biggest fear is being the last guy on the street who's still too poor to afford one

Hey, i have a question
12 years ago i met few estonian dudes who taught me some swear phrases i still remember
I dont know how to write them tho because i know nothing about estonian (eesti
Is that correct
Also, mind you, i'm croatian so i'll just type it as it sounds
The first one is basic "asshole" and it should be "berzeuk".
The second one is something i didnt understand but they said it's basic estonian insult and it goes something like this: "tura lic era pilu minuga e maxa norida".
The third one is on my request and it should mean "i piss on your mother's grave". It's "kushen su ema hauale".
Also, i have no idea how i still remember all of those
Well, that sounds about right
Thanks man
Now i can properly insult an estonian
Perseauk
But how can the second one be translated into so many words
Can you break it down for me please
Lol what
Thanks man
If i only knew i'd learn more phrases
Wow, crazy
Thanks for the explaination
You said none of them are used actually but you must be using "tura lits" if nothing else, right
You are, without doubt, a part of the worst thing about England
You're part of the dregs of English society
Nobody in the UK cares that Ireland didn't take an active role - it didn't stop many Irish people from joining British armed forces either
Similarly, the Irish are well aware of their neutrality - but you can't really blame them
Besides, plenty of countries remained neutral during the war
It begs the question, what on earth did you think you were doing when you took the time to write that comment
What exactly did you think it would achieve
Sure, Ireland was neutral - I never refuted that
But everything else you've said is assumptive
Secondly, Ireland is a victim of history - just because they chose not to act doesn't make them less of one
Perhaps, if they were treated better by the UK they wouldn't have had the political environment that generated a movement towards neutrality

Honest question for Latvians and Estonians, considering that more than every fourth person in your country is Russian, how do they react to anti-Russian climate and political decisions
Don't get me wrong, I am fully supporting you against them, but I am just wondering if the Russian minority is loud against such decisions or if they are more loyal to their "new"  homelands

So, does this cover Google Maps navigation
Google (even in the background) collects tons of data about road conditions, individual driving habits, predicts future conditions and it can suggest or divert the drivers to a less congested route
Considering how many drivers use Google maps and Waze for turn-by-turn navigation, can it be considered "manipulating human behavior using AI" if it tries to decongest the traffic by rerouting a large amount of people

It's like after watching that one ted talk, everyone is an expert on flag design
The whole "draw by hand" thing is not a hard rule but a rule of thumb and a very subjective one at that
For example, Kiribati that someone linked here as an example of a too complicated flag, looks awesome, who cares if a child can't draw it
Kids are crappy artists and if you stick to what they can draw you end up with variations on "3 parallel lines" or "Cross on a background" that don't look unique at all

Btw, does anyone have any sort of data on how much money each country will get
Btw, Croatia , as a result, was given two times more money for the period of 2021-2027, than 2013-2020
The amount of the money we got (22 billion€) covers about 35% of our GDP, or 40% of our GDP for 2020 (if we consider that it will fall by 10%)
So I'd say that I'm pretty much pleased with the results, I Know where a part of that money will go, but I'm also glad that we were given that amount

Well like half of the population of Croatia has either emigrated to Ireland or is planning to, so yes, Ireland is Balkan
The UK was always just Yugoslavia with money
The English are the Serbs, the Irish are the Bosnians, the Scots are the Croatians, the Welsh are the Slovenians and Cornwall is Macedonia
As to why
1) delusions of grandeur
2) split down religious and ethnic lines
3) just awesome people in general
4) have a language that everyone else kind of understands but not really
5) is always forgotten
I find this scenario very plausible
Belka is more likely the white one
Wrong for Croatia, I never heard someone say that
We usually refer to Chinese
Spansko selo
In croatia ive never heard spanish used in this context
Ive heard hungarian, french, turkish or chinese, but never spanish
Never ever heard anyone in Croatia refer to something they don't understand as "Spanish".
The closest I've ever heard along those lines was  "Kao da čitam Kineski" (As if I were reading Chinese) or just simply "Ma, Kineski" (Bah, Chinese)
In my area we often say it (Primorsko goranska)
Oh that's cool
I'm from Slavonija and we don't say that here
As a fellow Slavonian I can confirm that I have never ever heard that phrase
Apparently it's Serbia
You only even find mentions of it as "Špansko selo" (Serbian) and never "Španjolsko selo" (Croatian)
Podravina and Zagreb, never heard of someone saying "špansko selo" in that sense
Either Chinese or Turkish, even Hungarian is more often

I hope we buy Dassault Raffale at the end
It’s been mentioned as a considerable option by media and our defense minister last weeks
Well, I hope we get Grippens because they’re the most suitable for our defence system for they need much shorter track to take off, meaning they can be hidden more easily
But let’s be real, we’re most likely getting F-16, I just hope the newest version

There's just the issue with the term "marriage" being used as the term for the same-sex relationships being embodied in the legal sense
It's not marriage unless it's a man and a woman
leave the bieb out of this
It's not as simple as that
For me it boils down to having some pride over what I am, just as you people expect everyone to bow down in order to respect what gay people are
Marriage is for men and women
Marriage is not between people of the same sex
That's the only issue I have
Equality is not trampling on what holds significance and meaning to another person in order to accomodate yourself
There's plenty of books on the topic of why the kid is "poor" as compared to those who's paternal situation is normal

don't do that

I disagree
~~Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
~~ I believe that marriage should be the partnership of a man and a woman because such couples are capable of bearing children
Gay couples cannot do that and thus they cannot have a marriage but a legal partnership requiring a new term, by my current logic
> You people
Straight people
> Bow down
You've just demonastrated my point
Because I am not forfeiting my point from the get-go, or rather, because I even dared to discuss it, you've proclaimed not only me, but **the whole of people of Croatia** to be barbarians (that is what the ending of their (u/mmedepompadour) comment aabove says in Croatian: "zbog ovakvih stvari ljudi misle da su hrvati divljaci")
You can't have a civilised conversation
You start screaming hate unless you're pat on the metaphorical head of the point you're trying to make
> Gay people getting married somehow interferes with your feeling of pride
There's this movement called the "Pride" movement
It's about gay people standing up for their rights
So, with the (strong) assumption that you're supportive of that, why are you denying me to have pride over being straight and wanting to preserve my pride over it
> And marriage is just for straights - says fucking who
Even the Pope knows better
I am just here trying to talk about my point of view, calm down
> Anyway, zbog ovakvih stvari ljudi misle da su Hrvati divljaci
People who are capable of deeming an entire nation worth of people to be barbarians just because of their experience with a few people
I mean, how do you see yourself exactly
To be this abusive towards me for talking about what I think
You are supposedly fighting for gay people while simultanouesly displaying the hate that the very gay people are opressed by; Judgemental, prejudicial hate towards a group of people, which in your case is the people of Croatia
im sad that this is getting downvoted
PR stunt to appease the EU
In reality, the Serbian "Progressive" Party is
Well, progressive in its name is as meaningful as socialism is in the name of the Nazi Party
Look beyond the obvious and it becomes more clear that she's a token LGBTQ politician
In reality, Serbia has a history of extreme violence against homosexuals
I'm Croatian, and it's not like the situation here is much better, but it's quantifiably worse in Serbia: while Croatia held its first Pride parade in 2002 and then onward, it took Serbia until 2014 to hold one successfully (yes, there were a few Pride parades in Serbia, one in 2001 & 2010 in Belgrade, and another in Novi Sad in 2007, but all ended in violence, and the 2010 one was the most infamous one
If you wanna see more on the subject, there is a popular Serbian movie called *Parada* (The Parade) released in 2011
It's a comedy, but it tackles LGBT issues in Serbia
They are a man and a woman
They are not gay because they are a man and a woman the same way a gay couple cannot have a marriage for being a gay couple
> First off, it’s super fucked up to believe that everyone that gets married needs to have “getting kids” as the end goal
You don't make for a good reputation of gay people and their whatever like this
I've only once met an extreme supporter of gay rights who wasn't emotionally unstable
I didn't say that everyone that gets married need to have kids, you made it up and are so blinded by your emotions that you've asserted it as something I've said, when I never did
I did not express myself precisely though, so I'll give you that
The "Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
" part should've been "Marriage is the partnreship which is capable of bearing a family
> Second, I guess my lesbian parents count as married in your eyes, and that’s nice
They aren't your parents
They are your adoptive parents, legal guardians, or whatever the term is in your country
You are statistically likely to be greatly behind in the understanding of the sex missing in your household as one of the parents, which is important for the overall success in life
> it pains me that homophobia is so widespread
Coming from you, my understanding tells me that "homophobia" doesn't really mean homophobia but merely people who don't hold the same view as yourself on the topic
>  I don’t see how it will ever change when people such as yourself claim that giving equal rights to LGBT people means “bowing down” and “losing one’s sense of pride”.
Read again what was said
I didn't say that I need to bow down to "gay people", I said to "you people" meaning people such as yourself who are advocating their rights by throwing hate at anyone whose opinions and stances do not mirror your own
> I hope you’ll realise why this is wrong but I won’t hold my breath
Please, do not hold it
You need plenty of oxygen in your brain in order to realize that next-to-no-one ever agreed with anyone just because the other person thought they are wrong
> What’s the actual reason that the rule has to be “man and woman only”?
This
> Marriage is the partnership of which to raise a family is the goal
should've been this "Marriage is the partnership of two people which are capable of bearing children". And no that doesn't exclude infertile people or the like, but is simply meant to mean all legal acknowledgements of the relationship of a couple consisting of a man and a woman
So again, you aren't living with your parents, you are living with one of your parents
You lied, but are still being derogatory towards me
Just because you dislike something doesn't make it okay to want to ignore that something
> You’re telling me what the rule is, I’m asking you why the rule is
It's not the rule, it's what I think should be the definition
>Why is family the goal
I don't know
I just think that marriage should be the legal relationship of people capable naturally of achieving that goal
And yes, infertile people aren't excluded, the basis is man-woman, the natural thing
>Who decided that
Nature since the first life
> Why should their opinion matter to anyone
Who is they
I'll assume it's you and will say that your opinion should matter to anyone because you presumably live in a society, and you can't live in a society if the other people don't acknowledge your individuality
I mean, what kind of a question is that even
>What if family isn’t my goal with my wife
Nothing, you're still by default most likely capable of it and that's what matters for this
>What if we just want to be happy enjoying our marriage to each other
So be it
Life is long and you might decide on having children one day, you might not
But you could
Gay couples could not
What a mature conversation this has been

The only option UK and France had with Germany was war, and the only real way to stop Russians is war, difference is the disparity of power then and now, and existence of nuclear weapons
Any war against Russia will completely obliterate both sides
Actually if you look at the stockpiles of resources, geographical distribution of population, military assets, and manufacturing capabilities, you'll see that Russia will probably leave any nuclear conflict with an upper hand
With luck and proper use of missile defense and first strikes Russia could only lose as low as 60% of it's population, US and EU lose at minimum 70% of population, EU alone is basically 100% due to the small land area and huge concentration of people

Croatia uses nuclear energy too, not sure why it can't be seen on the graph
Sweden, muh man
Croatia looks pretty clean
This is a bit confusing
Where do we get all that renewable energy from
And why is there nothing about nuclear energy for croatia
We're sharing the nuclear powerplant Krško with slovenia
Croatian here
You sure this is accurate
We are that good
No way
Hydro energy, Wind energy and Solar energy
Croatia has a lot of it and the potential of even more renewable energy in Croatia is enormous
Well, read the contract better then, because Croatia will need to take care of 50% of waste and bear 50% of decommissioning costs
i know the potential is enormous and i knew we have a couple of hydro power plants but i didn't know about solar and wind, where do we have those
and i didn't know it's such a big part of our total energy consumption
Wind - Pag, Sibenik
Solar - somewhere in northern Adriatic
He is wrong
Croatia has obligation to take care of 50% of nuclear waste (when the plant shuts down)

Internet, social media, economic crisis, immigration crisis
(I know internet/social media existed even back then, but it took some time to become as central to society)
poland doesn't surprise me actually, given how you guys have been doing lately
\*reads\* that doesn't sound right
\*looks at country flair\* ah of course
I rly don’t know
Why is this so amusing to me
[Relevant]
Lol if you just took a picture of any Croatian city (apart from those on the coast) from 2012 and 2020 you wouldn’t see any difference
shit man, i swear to god that's the first city i captured from Tamar yesterday evening
will continue with my conquest tonight tho so hopefully the rest of her empire will fall as well to my immortal army
1) It's the automation that increased productivity, humans aren't pouring coffee or hammering nails any faster than they were 60 years ago
2) If people were willing to live the same lifestyle as 60 years ago, they could work much less
But everyone wants all the gadgets and products that were created in the past 60 years as well so in order to buy extra crap, you need to work more
It's down to choices
If you're willing to scale back consumption and pick what you're going to blow your money on more carefully, you'd have more time off
Most people would rather do something to get more stuff rather than do "leisure". Entire human civilization has been developed in this manner: need food to live, get better at making food
Now some people can stop making food and make some more pots and pans, better tools for everything involved
Now we need even fewer people for that so let's make some beer and build nicer houses so we don't get sick as often and are more productive; use that productivity to make something new and on and on it goes
We could've frozen it at any point and said "we have enough" but then what are you going to do
Sit on a beach drinking colored drinks with little umbrellas
How boring will that be after few weeks
There's nothing stopping you personally from freezing it and not buying new TVs, new phones, new whatever comes next
But you're not going to do that, are you
It's not just the phone, it's the dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, air conditioning, car with AC and better mileage and better safety features, microwave, etc
It's also food imported from all over the world, much more clothes than people 60 years ago had, internet access, computer and tablet, big TV with 300 channels, college education for everyone, health care for everyone, all kind of welfare and social services and on and on it goes
>even if you are a couple with two average incomes you need to really plan and lower your expectations when searching for a home
Yea, cause you're not happy with the kind of house people had 60 years ago, you want a bigger, fancier one, it has to be in the right neighborhood, etc
It has to be a "dream house"
People today have way more than our grandparents did and simultaneously have no sense of gratitude for it but are complaining they have to work for it
It's just silly
Move to a small house and ditch all that tech, use bicycle instead of a car, have 3 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts, eat cheap food and you can life off of one income with no problems
Not surprising, not sure who in their right mind would consider The UK,Russia and USA atm
all that trust worthy considering the leaderships all three countries have currently
> people who are more than happy to defend these assholes
I feel like this applies to myself, so I'll explain why exactly we "defend" these assholes
Every time the EU has attempted to solve these problems - be it the VAT on digital services or the currently-debated copyright directive - I, a person running a SME in the EU got screwed over with the regulation
At the same time, despite all the talk about a single digital market, half of Europe (you guess which half) is constantly treated like a damned hellzone when it comes to access to those same digital services - from the "We do not ship here" to the "no iTunes store for your country" all the way to the "Stripe is not available in your country".
So - here's a crazy suggestion - instead of destroying SME in this insane quest to get at Facebook, Google, etc - how about the EU actually push for a single digital market
Praise the Void
Serious question - how does it all affect the concrete foundation (roof, walls, appartments directly below)
Shouldnt the roots of trees be problematic

I‘m impressed to see that so many Croats like Ukraine as well
Guess it‘s not just a rumor that we are close friends
Слава Україні and love from Croatia
Happy independence day from Croatia Slavic Brothers️
Oh, happy birthday Ukraine
Croatia is with you ️
Slava Ukrajini
Slava Ukraina
We don't just like Ukraine we like/love all our Slavic Brothers
Mi ne volimo samo Ukrajinu mi volimo svu Slavensku Braću
We are not friends we are BROTHERS
That‘s awesome
I knew that Slavic languages are intelligible to some extent, but never thought of understanding such a high percentage
I listen to Ukrainian music every now and then as a matter of fact, and it‘s around 60% intelligible for me
I am sure that I would also be able to understand a bit more, if it was a little slower spoken
It depends on who you ask I suppose
I like all, but Ukraine has a special place in my heart and as it turns out many other Croats feel the same️
You wouldn’t see that many Croats congratulating if it was Russia or Serbia
Thank you so much
Ukraine is beautiful as well, you guys have everything (even a desert if I’m not mistaken)
I would love to visit your country one day
Quite interesting, for me Ukrainian often sounds somehow artsy
It mostly sounds and starts very familiar and as it goes on you add your own twist to that
Then I‘m confused, because it‘s sounds familiar and most of the time has the same meaning, but the change of pronunciation makes me always doubt it haha
Thanks for the recommendation, I‘ll make sure to check it out
Many people in Croatia definitely have sympathies, because of that
[Some Croats] even went to defend Ukraine in the Crimea crisis
And from what I‘ve heard some Ukrainians volunteered and fought for Croatia as well in the 90ies
There are also other reasons, why Croats like Ukraine
One of them is the believed story that the territory of modern day Ukraine was home of a tribe called White Croats
They supposedly inhabited the Croatian territories in the 7th century and are considered to be the ancestors of Croats today
We are cheering for you as well
After Croatia defeated Russia on the WorldCup 2018, our defense player Domagoj Vida and some other guy were punished for saying [Slava Ukraini] Eventually, a lot of Ukrainians bashed Fifa’s facebook page and even few representatives in the [Ukrainian parliament wore Croatian jerseys] as a sign of support
Also [Serbian newspapers reported] after their national team biggest defeat in Lviv, that there was an Ukrainian-Croatian brotherhood march prior to the match through the streets of the city
Also some report that they saw Croatian flags in the stadium
How is France different
Nahh
Tbh Yugoslavia isn't offensive, just looks weird with that Albanian dingle dangler
I am actually happy that Yugoslavia is back
As far as I can see, Trst is in our hands so I am satisfied
ŽIVOT DAMO TRST NEDAMO
IIRC There was not one death due to the change
Actually, there were less deaths than usual because everyone was being extra careful
Because what will this March accomplish
Will people say “you know, the last 10 marches didn’t convince me but this one will
” No they will not
If anything this march is doing the opposite
Like any large gatherings of people, trash will be left on the floor, to further hurt the environment
Also most of these people have probably done zero to actually help stop climate change
They are driving a car, buying imported food and clothes, buying plastic
They want to “save the planet” doing absolutely nothing and sacrificing nothing
This is stupid
Read the article
Flew with Aegean few times
Great customer service, terrible planes
Truth be told, I never flew with croatia arilines
Like, ever :D
Tariffs are huge and tickets are too expensive
For example, return flight to Greece with Aegean cost me around 200€ (give or take)
It would have cost me double if I choose Croatia airlines
No source has anywhere that she's Scottish
Also, she sounds English
This appears to be the first instance of the video:
It *is* posted by someone from Scotland
But again, nowhere does it state the woman is Scottish
I don't know why the OP has invented her nationality
Perhaps it's because he believes, rightly or wrongly, that this sub has a pro-Scotland and anti-England bias, which is ridiculous
I think it has more impact coming from an English person because Scotland voted to remain
Also, if you break down her argument, it sounds like it comes from an English person's perspective rather than a Scottish person's considering Scotland voted in favour of remaining in the EU
Can anyone tell me what she said
Cant hear it where i am
Thanks
How so they keep the paint on the walls so clean white
It's really funny that most likely Croatia gave more to Serbia then China
I wonder if Vucic will kiss the Croatian flag
(joke)
US, UN, and germany all gave their respective donations in bombings
Because here in the Balkans we are mostly against things based on how they look or how we're supposed to react to them, as you already know
So west bad ruined Yugoslavia without it us big world rulers, therefor against west good person country, China good
Plus I think Vučić has a hard on for authoritarianism anyways
It's a permanent state of picking a scab and yelling "See they are still hurting me
" unfortunately
It will die out, but we'll have to wait a bit
Montenegro is using Euro and on joining EU
Scotland can use it too if really necessary
It has some drawbacks, but I doubt that is an insurmountable obstacle for joining EU
Scotland can still opt for Euro if determined to join and this is actually necessary
And it is up to EU to  make an exception or not for Scotland
Or to make special arrangements until everything is ready
If all members agree, there is nothing stopping it
Hey, I actually lived there for a year with my parents when I was little :)
That was genuinely my first thought

Hmm, is that Croatia on the left bottom
They would get either shot on the spot or suffer the same fate

Try cycling in the Mediterranean or Balkan cities
I'm not just saying that it is hard to cycle uphill, although it really is
What I'm saying is that the traffic is chaotic and will always be that way
Uneven terrain shortens the field of sight and make the traffic less predictable and more prone to accidents
I just explained myself
It would be stupid to repeat myself if we are communicating in a written form

What exactly got resolved
so what happens with the Irish border now
Did they solve the border triple problem
The kind of unions that can be proposed varies drastically though
Yes, China, US and Russia have more soft power than the UK
But they also have more soft power than the EU
Wait
This might actually work
well there ARE street view data for Germany
I know because I normally used SV couple of years ago for a very small city/town Salzgitter
If there were SV there, I'm pretty sure there are SV everywhere across Germany
It's just because of the laws there Google is not allowed to display them
In other hand, on Mapillary, the free as in freedom data alternative to Google Streetview, they have loads of imagery:

Greetings from Croatia
Please do Croatia  cities I recomend our Split, Trogir, Zagreb
We are often not featured despite being in EU
You are obsessed with the US
RemindMe
20 days
so did they just mortar the missing elements on the facade
Why would you put stupid lies like this in the news
I dont get it,  something weird and fishy is here
Stay based Poland
You will into space one day
After everything else is left in commie Muslim rubble
Sounds similar to what's going on in Croatia right now
you can't even name cases like other nations standard (genitive, accusative, nominative, vocative, ect
I didn't mean both overlapped exactly
agreed
I'm actually surprised that Croatia is that low on the list
Our media usually spits and criticize the government almost every day
Though, they can be overwhelmingly manipulative when they want views
Uh I wish our press had less freedom
They are borderline retarded
They are the same as the British media
Example: they where campaigning for our army to buy unarmed planes because they are cheaper then armed ones
while ignoring that arming them will cost more then what our goverment tried to buy
Could have put the other (nonEU) countries up there as well
I’m not sure why Croatia is so low
I’ve never really heard of reporters here being biased
If anything they jump to any opportunity they can to call out the government, it’s what gets clicks after all
Formet communist countries be like: I can't do it, I can't let go that sweet censoring
as always
sigh
> Croatian journalists who investigate corruption, organised crime or war crimes are often subjected to harassment campaigns
Defamation is criminalized and insulting “the Republic, its emblem, its national hymn or flag” is punishable by up to three years in prison
Worse still, “humiliating” media content has been criminalized since 2013
The government has not stopped meddling in the affairs of public TV broadcaster HRT, and HRT’s management continues to sue employees who have complained about this problem, and has gone so far as to bring a complaint against the Association of Croatian Journalists
Meanwhile physical attacks, along with threats and cyber-violence, continue to be a major problem for journalists without any reaction from the authorities
Yeah that surprised me too
Don't know what is this based on because our media has a lot of freedom
We don't accept shithole countries
How is uk so low
(Eg hungary is stronger than uk)
Yay my country Croatia is getting popularrrrr
This whole situation with the greenery taking hold and animals coming back really shows how the post apocalyptic  urban jungle scenario was understated if anything
Haha to je u mojoj državi, ne vidiš to svaki put

The dutch also drained parts of East Anglia and Lincolnshire in the UK
Make Ely an island again
Would unironically be pretty cool tbh, can you imagine travelling across wetlands on raised causeways and then there's an island with a big-ass cathedral over the horizon

Don't know the details of how, but there are rivers there, so they set it up so that they first turned the sea to lake and than drain it

Wish we in Croatia managed to group up over these things
Go neighbours

wait a minute
I love how nothing changed for Croatia and Serbia, still next to eachother <3
can we like try with a different neighbour at least on imaginary maps for fucks sake
Croatia and Serbia still neighbour's. Truly meant to be
It kinda fits, right
Finland and Lithuania / Norway and Croatia and KINDA naturally compearable

Damn I can't imagine someone comes here from all the way up there
Do you take the plane directly to Brač or is it cheaper to go to Split and take the ferry
Ok Croatia and Serbia, calm down

Maybe I am biased but I really expected everyone to know
Yeah I bet that's an awesome experience
Whenever someone asks me what to do in Croatia (I live in Germany so it happens quite often), I tell them to just rent a boat and explore old towns, islands, inaccessible beaches etc
There's so much to do
I don't really know how to respond to that

Yeah, it was a weird ordering, I thought it was originally by their endological (native) names, because 'Hrvatska' and 'Kroatien' are really close by (and I wasn't paying enough attention), but the last 3 totally confused me
"We". You surely are a valuable contribution with that kind of worldview
Jesus, I'm so bloody sad now
Yea could of photoshoped another moon to be like eyeballs
Whs is Croatia as one region
We have Panonija, Slavonija, Lika, Dalmacija, Gorski Kotar and Istra
I mean i knew it but it still hurts a lil bit
You, sir, are full of shit
Take this fucking map of yours and change Croatia from "less developed" to "idiotically underdeveloped" right now
Developed in what sense
lol
Zagreb isn't less developed
I wonder what will Croatia look like :D

More importantly, dividends are how companies should be rewarding shareholders
Dividend stocks have shareholders that prefer steady returns over massive gains in share value
If the only thing a stock has going for it is the price constantly going up, that's what shareholders are going to demand
Who cares if a move ends up being catastrophic in the long run, it's making money now
There are good arguments against dividends in some cases
Some companies actually do need to grow fast just to stay competitive, but especially well established giants could really benefit from a "keep on, keeping on" approach, rather than trying to drive the share price up to even greater levels
Ultimately, the big difference is that buybacks are just one more tool in the share price driven world to sacrifice long term stability for short term gains, where as divided stock is only worth a damn if it's consistent and anything that compromises long term viability is going to hurt the share price
> Effectively it's the result of a EU-wide race to the bottom combined with increased globalization
It's a global race and it's not to the bottom but rather an equilibrium - a fair tax rate for public services
Nobody wants to live in a Mad Max wasteland
Don't stop there - anything less than 50% tax on anybody richer is outright theft from the proletariat
It really isn't. It's reported income, publically reported in fact
If you actually wanted to dodge paying taxes you would never, ever take your money out of your company anywhere in the EU
While it's taxed at a lower rate than a salary, to pay a divided you need to first make a profit
Then you need to report said profit and not use accounting tricks to hide it
Then there's the bit where you're actually running a business rather than just getting a paycheck
You need to deal with all the government requirements, report everything, pay taxes, not just have your employer subtract them from your salary
My dad incorporated for tax reasons while still basically being an employee and he gets to keep a bit more than he makes, but regrets the move
An accountant doing his books would negate most if not all of the gains so he now essentially has a part time job on top of his full time job
Unless you're already run a businesses and have to do that stuff anyway, it's absolutely not worth it
If you make enough for it to be worth it, there are better, perfectly legal ways to save far, far more in taxes
Criminal law
You can't charge people with a crime if the action wasn't criminal when they did it
This is a government bailout
The government sets any condition it wants
Not really
it's that way by _design_. Government don't care about fairness when it comes to taxes
They only care about filling public coffers
Fairness doesn't even enter the calculation
The only time "fairness" is even mentioned is when they need to turn on their propaganda machines for the masses
For example - why are salaries taxed so heavily compared to, well, everything else
> Inequality will only increase
It's kind of funny how inequality is only ever mentioned in the context of domestic policies
Very rarely will somebody mention inequality in a global context
And with good reason - someone might point out that even the poorest European is rather well off compared to a person living in Africa in, for example, a former colony of a European power
I was thinking more along the lines of wealth redistribution - why isn't anybody suggesting we redistribute wealth from "rich" Europe to Africa
After all, I'm sure Europe could do without cutting edge cancer treatment if it meant Africa got basic health services
But it would be smaller and weaker than NATO currently is
Didnt the greeks started this shit ?
EU has more people though
USA has done 25M tests in total, which is around 77k tests/1M people
From major EU countries, Spain did more tests (103k), Italy about the same (77k), and others less (Germany 56k, Poland 32k, France 21k)
But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections
Humans can eradicate diseases
Just because they exist naturally it doesn’t mean that humans shouldn’t fight against them to advance their own interests
Indeed, though I’m always really cautious with any such comparisons
Just because official data suggests one thing, it doesn’t mean we should relax too much
It can always come back for as much as we know, and the data may be flawed to begin with
Death rates vs the previous year are all but worthless since all kinds of numbers are out of whack, most notably traffic accidents being down significantly
Here in Croatia we might actually have fewer deaths than last year if the current Corona mortality holds and tourist season traffic doesn't pick up
The numbers would consequently indicate Corona saving lives
Interesting
I took itnfrom here:
It’s in per 1M people
They benefited from everyone around them taking strict measures
International travel grinding to a halt made it easy to control the virus if the spread wasn't too advanced and precautions were taken
However, it doesn't take many cases for the disease to spread rapidly if left unchecked
In Croatia during the height of the pandemic you couldn’t even travel between cities without a permit
So, now protests are to blame for the pandemic, last time I checked it was Obama
Why did they keep the debate format then
We had a similar situation a few weeks ago where the opposition leader refused to participate
But they did not keep the podium and debate format, instead they turned it into 1 on 1 extended interview with the candidate
Worst timing ever really, we just changed our tires to summer ones and then woke up next morning with a snow storm

>The main focus of /r/Europe is the geographical region of Europe within the borders of the Caucasus, Ural and Bosporus strait (plus Cyprus, Greenland as well as the Caucasus countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia)
>In addition to the areas mentioned above all areas belonging to members of the Council of Europe in their entirety (plus Kazakhstan) are considered on-topic for casual submissions, as long as they don't violate any other rules
Što je slatka
>There are two major countries in Europe that are transcontinental (Russia and Turkey) where special rules apply for the geographically Asian parts
>News submissions from these geographically Asian areas of Russia and Turkey are only considered on topic if the news is pan-Russian/pan-Turkish (e.g. national politics, protests, major events) or if it is directly engaging another European nation
I mean, you were part of the roman empire and a majority of your country is christian, sounds pretty european to me
I didn't mean it as being exlusive, also i was too tired to write an essay about the cultural similarities with european culture etc
Looks like some traditional garments
They seem similar to the ones in the balkans
I didn't say it was exclusive and i was too tired to type an essay why armenia is a part of europe
~~They're arabs or arabians, i forget which one is which
~~The regions culture has changed after the islamic invasions and the religion changed as well
Sorry i missread your comment
But this is all mute since most people look at europe geographically instead of culturally

Europe desperetaly needs a massive protest which will succeed in fullfiling its goal
Not just Europe, the world itself, there are too many massive protests catching the eye of the public and interest of milions and then just dying out without any sort of actual change being made
My heart goes out to those brave people, who i admire greatly, in Serbia, Hong Kong, Lebanon and many many others and now Belarus and i cannot even imagine the hopelesness one must feel upon seeing everything going back to as it were before after so much effort and sacrifice was made
But do not despair, you just might be the one fullfiling their goal because shadow is but a passing thing, when the sun shines it will shine out the clerarer

You are probably working in the public sector yourself so you don’t give a damn where the money for your benefits comes from
For my country (Croatia) estimates are that of 100€ of taxes 30€ goes back in the system the rest is eaten by the administration/government itself
Those inept incapable bureaucratic corrupted fucks are eating the life of the private sector, they just want more more more taxes to hire more relatives and party members

i recently moved to åland, finland and cant wait for summer for the first time in my life, not dealing with temperatures i had back in Rab, Croatia from 35-40c on average is gonna be fantastic
If tue, the UK will have bantered itself into YUKoslavia
What a coincidence that the numbers exploded with the protests
Another interesting thing is that percentage of young people infected in US skyrocketed
hmm, maybe riots had something to do with it
Yes, but with Trump it's terribly great
Yes they did
How about changing it to "Genghis Khan conqueror of China"... sound more fancy to me
Yeah but this would piss off the CCP so its better that way
Its not even close to the same, try and find any living person who was there and on top of that
thats how war was back then
True but the scars of ww2 can still be seen and felt
unlike Khan and his sons
I mean they(Mongols) took Croatia and couldn't care less
Bahahhahahahahahhahaha

I really doubt anyone with an actual functioning brain believes this to be a sign of generosity and not just a simple propaganda picture
it's pretty much what the Serbians did in Srebrenica when they took over, they promised to take care of the civilian population, saying that they're treating them fairly during an interview and now that place is known for the biggest genocide and war crime that happened during the Yugoslav civil war
It's insane that still to this day they're denying the things they did and that some outside people actually believe them, even my country's shit corrupt government didn't deny the horrible crap NDH did in WW2

Thank you so much
Because in Sweden, the salary for a radiologist is probably as much as 3-5 times larger than in Croatia

Pretty crazy to think about
Jesus was born around 5 AD
It's actually fairly weird how close that is 1 BC is to the actual birth of Christ, considering we started counting dates from his birth more than 500 years after he was born
Obviously, like everything that's millenia old, it's an estimate, so take it with a grain of salt
There's pretty strong consensus among historians, especially credible ones, that Jesus was definitely a historic figure
We're also pretty sure he was born in Galilee, he was baptized by John the Baptist, was a preacher with a large following, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate
The rest is kind of up for debate
There are also lots of sources that aren't biblical, both Cristian and non-Christian
A few historians of the time are considered credible, including Thallos, Josephus and Tacitus
There are also mentions of Jesus in the Talmud
There's a pretty good list of evidence and what we know here:

Tnx for the reply
wonder why I got downvotes, I think I made a legit question
All ex-communist countries have that same problem, I am not even sure it can ever be solved
At least by the experience we have in Croatia, because it’s not only the government or the parliament, it’s all the local governments, regions, cities, councils, all the public companies on all levels, there is corruption everywhere and it includes hundreds of thousands of ppl
All the system is broken
The political parties have been successfully infiltrating their people everywhere , that with time have become corrupt and now they all want to maintain that status quo (because they live a decent life out of public money and what they get under the table to actually do their jobs)
Don’t change a thing
And these ppl have friends and families
Basically there is something like 1/3 or more of the population that is part of the sick corrupt system and they have the control of everything and it’s almost impossible to change all of that
And they are dragging the country down for decades
While the private sector struggles and young ppl run away

Ottoman invasions will do that to you
hahahh
Maybe Trump gave Vučić something else besides a pen and keys
And that is exactly what happend
It was round looking country untill Otomans came
Lol, what are you talking
Bosnia was there before the ottomans came
The borders in that shape are older than ottoman invasion
Is it tho
No, they're not
The fact that Bosnia existed before Ottomans has nothing to do with the borders of todays Croatia and BiH
The modern understanding of borders comes from the 19th century
It’s exactly because of the Ottoman invasion
Dalmatia, for the most part, was never part of the Ottoman Bosnian Eyelet and switches rulers more than any region in that part of Europe
The border between Croatia-Dalmatia and Bosnia was officially established nearly **two centuries ago**.
What are you on about
I did not say that Bosnia did not exist before Otomans
Ofcourse it did, but not in borders like today
They are product of Habsburg/Ottoman empires
Looks rather similar for me
Sure the borders keep moving through time
But round looking
Bosnia yes, but not Croatia
Are you fucking dense
Do you even read what people are telling you
>The fact that Bosnia existed before Ottomans has nothing to do with the borders of todays Croatia and BiH

Can someone explain me why is Breivik allowed to live in a 3-room cell with television, PC and gym
He should be locked in a 3 m2 cell with a hole used as toilette and that's it
Like the fact that he will be free aged 53 isn't enough sad and unfair
Do law makers understand that those kids had whole lives ahead of them
Many of them never experienced simple joys in life we don't even think about, things we don't even notice as something special because they appear to us as normal, everyday joys
They will never meet their better half, get drunk with friends
those kids won't turn 18 or whatever is adult age in Norway
Lives of their parents, brothers, sisters, grandmas, grandpas, friends is destroyed
Most marriages never recover after losing a child and therefore other kids suffer too
Older people often get sick and die after losing a grandson/grandaughter
So many young ambitious people, people who wanted to change the world to a better place are not with us because of someone's madness
And now, as his prize, he lives a better life than 80% of world population
I hope someone takes justice in own hands when Breivik is free because the law is obviously on his side
Sorry about "free to leave after 21 years" part
I didn't read wiki article till the end
That man has no purpose for society
He is just spending goverment's money
He is suing Norway for not treating him right
Isn't that hypocritical
Did he care for basic human right- right to live while killing all those innocent people
I don't see him and other people capable for doing such crimes as persons
They are dangerous animals and should be treated that way
I'm not saying that the law is on side of people who eant to kill Breivik, but opposite
I say that the law is on Breivik's side because I don't see his sentence as something that punishes him
>and you could end up in prison yourself by accident
No, I don't think I can accidentaly commit massive murder
>try to preserve your own dignity by not abusing weak and damaged humans
He is not weak, just seriously damaged
I'm getting a feeling that you kinda feel bad for him
That's because you are big human
You can feel empathy even for bad people
On the other hand he doesn't.
>It doesn't give the victims satisfaction or justice, it doesn't prevent crimes from happening
Ofc it doesn't, but at least it would take his complacent smile off his face

CENTRAL
WE TAKE IT
We made it boys
The fact this line splits Italy and France, bit puts entire Croatia in a single region is ridiculous
Personally Croatia should be split in three parts
We are very small but the regions on the sea have nothing in common with the inland and then again inland is split in 2 parts
What differs from what I personaly considered:
- My country, Croatia, is always in between of central, southern and southeastern
When I explain where Croatia is to someone who doesn’t know, I say we’re “the southernmost part of central Europe, you know where’s Italy
Just across the sea from them
(silent pause while they’re looking at the map) Not that side, that’s Africa; the other side”.
- I never considered Estonia, Latvia & Lithuania central European, they were alway some weird eastern/northern mix to me
happy croat-slovene noises
Central Europe is Austra-Hungary & Germany
Central Europe, yes
Maybe if you cleared your throat before speaking Germans might consider you closer to them
Historically
Yes
Politically
It's debatable
Culture
We're actually influenced by all 3 South, Southeast and Central Europe depending on part of country
Geographically the same
I don't get why this version and many other maps put whole countries in the same region
I mean some countries are really diverse
Croatia is a great example of that
The border is probably made on the old Hapsburg-Ottoman line

Hmm, pretty sure that there are older businesses in Croatia

Yes, it was bought and continued working after being privatized and downsized, but it doesnt really count

>Croats, Montenegrins, Albanians: do tourists sometimes use Italian names for your cities
Do Italian tourists do
If so, does that annoy you
They don't use Italian names, but what is annoying is when Italian tourists expect everyone here to understand Italian (when most people don't) and refuse to speak English (which most people do)
And it is them who need fucking directions, I don't benefit from the conversation at all
Shouldn't you be begging for Istria instead
Wanna trade it for Trieste
It's annoying that this is somehow a debatable issue
Geographically, Europe is quite clearly defined, Anatolia is not part of it, Thrace is
Non-geographically, we shouldn't be discussing Europe, because Europe IS a geographical concept
Turkey does have land in Europe, not all of it is inside Europe, non of this is debatable
As for weather or not Turkey should be in the EU and other questions of grouping Turkey with European countries, there's a lot more to consider than geography, but every time people invoke geography and manage to disagree on a well established fact
Yes, of course, but they don't get used in day to day life
On this day 28 years ago, the fiercest battle Europe has seen since World War II ended with the fall of Vukovar
>Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against as many as 36,000 JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery
During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day
At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War
When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled
Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina
Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle
>The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war
A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later
Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia with the signing of the Erdut Agreement
It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle
Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity
[Some lesser known photos from Vukovar] (NSFW)
Siege of Vukovar is a modern tale of 300 Spartans
Take a look at it this way
From one side, you have the Croatian forces
Only 1800 personnel, most of them were cops, others were volunteers, poorly equipped, with only light weaponry or outdated rifles
Pistols and old bolt rifles, and no support
On the other side, you have the YNA
000 personnel arriving from Danube with tanks, armored support, helicopters, artillery rockets, heavily armed soldiers, and a huge amount of support
Even the most biased, optimistic strategists would give Croatians maybe a week, two weeks, as they were outnumbered 20 to 1 with barely any weaponry compared to the YNA
But no, they defended the city for **87 days
** That's almost 3 months
3 fucking months on depleted supplies and constantly losing men
As such, despite the horrors that the Vukovar region bore witness, also including the Ovčara massacre, it's also a point of pride for us
They held the city on almost nothing but sheer willpower and hope despite knowing that it's futile
It's the definition of a Phyrric victory
Despite finally taking over the city, the YNA lost 1100 men and 3500 more were wounded, they also lost 3 planes and 110 tanks, nor to mention, so much time that they could have used to massively push forwards towards Zagreb, which was only 185 miles away and could have been reached easily, since the Croatian Army was just barely formed and wasn't ready for such an advance seige
[Here is some footage] that I always found disturbing, but it best demonstrates not just the destruction of the city, but the civilians killed and thousands forced into exile at gunpoint
What makes it all the more hard to watch is the fact that hundreds of them were taken and massacred outside of town [at Ovčara] and hundreds more taken into [prison camps in Serbia] (Stajićevo, Begejci, Sremska Mitrovica, Aleksinac, Niš, Belgrade) where they were mentally and physically tortured and dozens where killed
I'm glad to see that our war is  mentioned and remembered
I was in that town few years ago
Seeing that hospital, hearing about people dying, hearing about how 3 kids were born in that hospital during that time
The story about bomb being dropped through ceiling on a patient's bed
I was shocked about it
Hearing about how every day new Croatian flag was put on that tower
Knowing it will be attacked even more until there is no flag
And being impressed how that mighty tower is still proudly standing, after everything it has gone through
I live in Croatia, I'm so lucky I didn't have to experience it
And serbs be like: "But we were not aggressors, we defended"
My dad still has a belt buckle with a GDR coat of arms on it
Thanks for that
Thank you for helping when help was most needed ️
I think it's this:
Here's another pic of the same street:
Balkan wars is something of a prelude to world war 1
This was from Croatian war for independence
One moment from that video is something I remember even to this day - the guy saying "sve su to ubice i kasapi, lez'te dole". Every once in a while that hateful son of a bitch pops into my mind and I wonder where he is now and if anything ever happened to him for what he did
If he's alive somewhere, hopefully he dies the most painful way possible
The EU is an idealistic project rooted in humanism, Yugoslavia was rooted in totalitarianism
It was doomed to fail just like the Soviet Union
UN soldiers in Srebrenica were literally tied to a fence while the genocide was being done
they just went half-arsed thinking nobody is going to dare to do anything
Ukraine would like to have a word with you
Ah yes,  as a Belgian you'd be the expert here
Tell me, how many days without government will it be the next time
>  Serbs may not have started the war
Yes, they did, first, they attacked Slovenia
And after that, they armed the Serbian population in Croatia and supported them to start the "civil" war which they joined with their army not long after with excuse that they're defending those Serbian's in Croatia
(Which again they armed and manipulated to start fighting and at the end when they saw that they will lose the war, abandoned and tell them to run away from Croatia
And after that played victim card that they were forced "ethnically cleaned" out of Croatia )
And also they started a war in Bosnia
Anyway, a retarded move by the Serbian government, in general, to start a war after Yugoslavia break up
Yugoslavia broke up, and so what, return to normal life like it was before Yugoslavia and that's it
But no, they wanted to make "great Serbia".
And what's even sadder, all those generals, politicians etc
were huge rednecks and also they armed plenty of criminals to fight for them, and whole nation followed them and commanded them
It would seem you don’t know much about Yugoslavia
It was federation of republics: Slo, Cro, BiH, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro + two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina and Kosovo
Every federative rep had right to secede by Constitution
(We are not talking about provinces here or regions, but republics
Then they put in new [Constitution from 1974] that the decision about secession needs to be unanimous
That means that every federative rep needed to say yes
That’s not really:
> without approval from the state itself
You see, Yugoslavian Federal Presidency aka Yugoslavian government (the state itself) had no real power anymore in 80s. Power was in federative rep
All federal rep had a long history and were independent in some point in history
You seem to be under impression that Yugoslavia was some kind of real and old country
It wasn’t. It was communist country 45 years old, under one-party system made by unification of nations which became federal republics
> Defending the existence of Yugoslavia would've been admirable
Had the nation remained intact,
Yugoslavia was federation of rep, not a nation
> Had the nation remained intact, it would likely be one of the leading powers of Europe today to the benefit of all its peoples
Yeah, leading power of EU with food stamps, you cant drive your car every second day, if youre not a part of the party you might as well not exist, etc
Topkek, keep telling yourself your sad stories

Why
I love it when people that never came close to my country start telling me about how was it to live in it and what it was
Gtfo
> but I remember
I remember when Serbs run before Ottomans and Croatia gave them refuge some centuries ago
I remember it like it was yesterday
You do understand that majority of the Croats were in partizans during WW2 and fought against Ustashe
> “However the Ustashe never received massive support from ordinary Croats
From your link
Communist Yugoslavia was 45 years old
As I wrote
I wasn’t talking about first Yugoslavia
I know what Constitution says
I also know when and why it was done
I never said that the secession was legal, but I do think it was right
Especially as there is that one thing called self-determination
Yeah, i'll trust you
After all you live on the other side of the world while i live in croatia
Of course you should know more about the topic than the rest of us
Please, tell me more about what happened here
If and when you manage to climb down from your high horse, I will be more than happy to rectify and fill some of the more obvious gaps in your knowledge
Saying that Ustasa ideology is in any way, shape or form influencing Croatia now (or that it was present as a majority movement during the 90's) is not only factually incorrect but a damned and very malicious lie
For God's sake man, our first president was Tito's general
We had right on a basis of self-determination as we lived in our nation-state, had historical territory and were republic
This is not an issue
Everyone knows this
You can google this and you have many scientific papers about it
Serbs in Cro were just minority
Nothing else
And Krajina was nothing
No territorial organisation whatsoever in 1991
I already said that by constitutional changes in 1974 our secession wasn’t legal, but as it happened and all other countries recognized us and we won the war defending ourselves, it’s legal now
And here we are

Formally, VdL had nothing to do with that council and its conclusions
The best solution would be stopping climate change

Well, 20% of our total GDP comes from Tourism (For example, Germany, France, Greece 4-7%)
If Corona lasts for a long time, things might get rough
From my point of view, I find that Bulgarian and Macedonian sound similar
Polish has too much c and z sounds and you kinda have a different accent
In a way I'd say you sound similar to Russian as well but I find it interesting your relatives disagree
Very interesting to know
Sorry, reading in a hurry
Still, fascinating to learn that
Also, I'd be hard pressed to notice a difference between Russian and Belarussian
Perhaps if I find a video comparing them side by side I might notice
I was totally cheering for belgium
that's considered good luck
Slovenia : NO
Nah, Slovenia will most definitely block us
You would probably block our entry (even if Slovenia did a complete 180)
Oh I understand completely
And to be honest, I wouldn't hold it against you if you did block us, it's been almost a friggin decade for you guys (and only a few months for us)
I would be pissed beyond measure if I were in your shoes and some other country enters the EU e.g. Montenegro and gets the green light to enter the Schengen
Croatia would also block them
I did some readings about that and the conclusion I made is that Croatia is about to enter the Schengen individually; without Bulgaria and Romania, because of interests of the European powerhouses like Germany, Italy, France etc
The decision is due in mid-2020
Of course, Bulgaria and Romania have the right (and probably will try) to block it and I'd completely understand that, considering the fact how long they're waiting themselves
But it seems that it's Germany and co
who have the last word about that
The Schengen enlargement falls within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, an area which still requires approval from all EU member states
Well
there's Greece without any Schengen land neighbours
Sure np
According to the article, those are not bigger, but literally the same problems you guys have
Oh look at that
Someones' personal view differs from what the media say
What are the odds
Your point leads to my comment, in which my i stated my own personal conclusion independent from the media
You pointed out a Croatian news article, for wich you claimed that it says that we have bigger problems than you do
I proceeded to enlighten you, since the article negates your own statement; the article states that those are the same problems, which Bulgaria and Romania are currently facing regarding the Schengen accession
You, afterwards, tried to prove me wrong by quoting my comment, in which I shared my own personal conclusion, which differs from what the media and that specific article say
It doesn't mean I'm right, nor does it mean that I'm wrong
I hope that clarifies it for you
r/AccidentalRenaissance in the upper right corner
Coming from a small country, I find this all pretty funny
Free movement of capital and labor is great until it isn't - for the big players
So let's force countries like Ireland and Luxembourg and what-not to change so that poor Germany and France aren't losing any more tax money
But let's not touch freedom of movement for labor - God forbid that richer members can't siphon any more human capital from poorer members
That would throw a wrench in their economies and we can't have that, can we
True - but let's be honest - what fucks you harder; not getting that sweet tax revenue, or losing hundreds of thousands of your people which you desperately need to staff your industries and public institutions and effect social change
> you're labeled big evil bureaucrat European Union
Evil
Egoistical
Definitely
If Germany or France has a problem, the EU has a problem
If anybody else has a problem, you can go solve your own damn problem
We don't want to encroach on your "sovereignty".
By that logic, there's a very simple solution to solve all of humanity's problems - just kill everybody
No humanity - no problems
> Germany and France are the biggest contributors
Of course they want to defend their interests and of course the EU has a problem when two of the biggest net contributors have a problem
See, I was under the impression that the EU was a European project - and that includes all the member states, not just France and Germany
If I'm wrong, maybe Brexiteers aren't all that crazy after all
> It's easy to hate on the EU but people tend to forget how much money flows into countries who contribute almost nothing
And all that money means diddly squat
Let me explain - just because countries _can_ get funds doesn't mean they will nor that those funds will be spent wisely ( [example] )
Now, before you start with the "well it's their own fault
" you have to remember something - Croatia lost up to 300,000 people (according to unofficial numbers) in the last couple of years
Those people aren't participating in the Croatian economy, aren't staffing its public institutions or trying to improve their country for the better through political action
And crucially for your argument - aren't trying to get EU funds and use them to improve their country
So you're left with two kinds of people - the incompetent, who can't get access to EU funds and if they do, can't use them effectively, and the corrupt, who use the money to line their pockets
So yeah, you can keep your money - I'd rather have my countrymen here trying to build this country into a respectable place to live rather than spending their working lives enriching the German (or Irish, or whichever) economy
> How are France and Germany egoistical if they're the biggest net contributors
Because they present their problems as everybody's problems
But that principle obviously doesn't apply when other member countries have a problem
And I wouldn't call Poland small (if that's what you're implying)
Masterpiece
How come it's still light outside but snow on the hills
Is there snow all year round or what
Because, as i understood, it gets warmish during summers in norway
Please, the next time give the photo more meaningful title

3AM now is as dark as it gets

To be fair, the peace is more do to NATO than the EU
Tell that Greece and Turkey

I'm in a member country of the EU and I'm not pro EU, if the sub was called EU I wouldn't be here but its called Europe so I am here

Fuck I don't want to jump to conclusions but this really gives me that same sick feeling from Paris those years ago
Different locations, still an active situation more than an hour later
Just
awful
Good luck Austria

I’m still trying to wrap my mind around this
I never felt unsafe in Vienna
Austria has always gone an extra mile to be inclusive
This is just so mindless
I just hope this won’t result in a the wedge in society
Shit
Stay safe
It is
It was
And I’m sure it will stay one of the safest cities
Austrians are nothing, if not pragmatic
So I’m sure you guys will find the way for this never to happen again
Neither am I directly affected
But I do feel violated and angry nonetheless
Vienna was my home for quite some time
I grew to love that city and it’s people
And the fact I never felt unsafe
Support is for common sense
For an inclusive, humane, empathic society we are trying to build
For the victims who had to pay the highest price for Europe to one day hopefully achieve all that
For their families and friends
And for every Viennese and Austrian person who will feel violated by this senseless act
Today it was Vienna
But this won’t stop until something changes
We need to figure out why this is happening
And do something about it
Bottom line is, we are in this shit together
We do stand behind you
And together we can push for the change
I've been there
It's nice
Imagine scrolling through reddit and you see your own house
Ah our monthly dose of commuting Austrian president

Lol Italy and Croatia, what are those two anyways
atheism is the new norm
The Czechs cannot be allowed to continue to abandon their fellow Catholic Slavs - time for the Poles, Slovaks, Slovenes and Croats to form a military coalition I think

Also, no one uses "sranje", it's like something you'd say infront of your boss or grandma and no eyebrows would be raised
kurac is definitely an essential multitool in Croatia
In the Balkans we use kurac, pička materina and other stronger cuss words
Sranje is super mild and almost no one uses it
sranje is meh
Kurac or Idi u pičku materinu are a lot better
Kurac, a u pizdu materinu,...
KURAC
Yeah, it's somewhere on the level of Serbian "Do đavola" or Croatian "K vragu". Something you'd hear in local soap opera where all characters speak perfect official version of the language and have flawless diction

Good as fuck
The weird thing is, none of those sounded weird (well, not so much) until you translated them
It's like when you know someone called Sandra Brown
You don't really think consciously about her last name being a color
But if you went around and translated her last name to Serbian, it would be kind of funny because colors aren't used as last names there

I want to say that this year's and the previous year's Summers have been by far not as hot as the ones up until 2 years ago
Up until two years ago, I couldn't even sleep at night naked because of how hot I'd been
I would lay on the tiles of my floor in order to get cooled down by them, and then I'd eventually fall asleep after like 30 minutes or an hour of trying to accept the heat
This year and the last year, I've had only a couple of such nights
It was hot, but no where near as hot as it was up until two years ago
The hottest temperature I could find in Europe were Paris, France at 35 and Dubrovnik, Croatia at 34
Everyone: France u gud man
France: no
Pain
love this weather
love this weather
TIL that "heatwave" is 27 celsius
So there were uprisings in Paris
TIL
Such a peaceful town
Woa, woa
I was sure my sarcasm was damn obvious
I went to school, revolution, paris commune and shit, saw les misarables, several versions, read the book in fact
For christ sake, went several times to paris, walked the northern parts
I even like this song: [Paris is burning] Oh, and she's great
Oh, well
talking of trivias and les miserables, that roundabout in the upper right corner is place victor hugo, conected to arc via the victor hugo avenue

Asclepius was god of medicine and doctors, while Hermes was the god of thieves, liars, salesman (among other things)

While I know the literal translation is "per head", per capita doesn't have to mean "For each person" - it just means "Normalised to the population".

Because they weren't in the EU
At which point they skyrocketed and are now above the UK in basically every metric, from life expectancy to income which also reflects in a higher Human development index
This map is bad, because 49% is red and 50% is green
It needs a yellow inbetween
When it comes to Croatia (and Slovenia I guess), the Muslim part is green because when that question is asked we think about Bosniaks which are culturally almost the same as us
I would be perfectly fine with that
I would be very reserved about Middle eastern Muslims, not because of religion but vastly different cultures
Especially if I had a daughter, because of the status women have in that society
Croatia confirmed Western
Croatian parents just dont fucking care XD
P R O G R E S S I V E
really interested if for "relashionship with Black person" would change if Carribean-black and African-black were different questions (atleast for the UK)
So wrong for Croatia where did they get their info :D
At least for the top and bottom left
Swedes are weebs
yeah, those statistics are wrong about Croatia
Somehow I doubt this data, as a Croat
Also, why not include balkan countries (I know this is the EU, but it would be "interesting". Also, what's up with Czechs and Slovaks
Something is wrong here
There is simply no way some of these statements are true for Croatia
Croatia too
Although we favour Asians a bit
Wat
They're culturally and ethnically European
That's the similarity
Afghanistan isn't an extreme example, it's one of the few places left that genuanly has a different culture
While every group everywhere wants to think of them selves as unique an special, there are maybe a handful of district cultures currently on the planet
Everything is homogenous
Everyone listens to the same music, wears the same clothes, basically speaks the same language
Everything from food and art to architecture, law, business and education has been condensed in to a few major groups
There are diffences within the major groups, but they're mostly surface level
If you compare people with similar backgrounds in similar situations in different countries around Europe, you find a bunch of similar people
The principal cause of percieved rifts is that people are comparing them selves to others in different circumstances
Basically rich countries see them selves as culturally similar to rich countries and dissimilar to poor countries because culture is percieved superficially
It doesn't matter that a poor, uneducated person in one country acts much the same as a poor uneducated person in another, simply because one country has more poor uneducated people it will be seen as a country with a culture of poverty and ignorance, reguardless of external factors that may have created the situation
E.g. Ireland was the poor, uneducated and thus culturally backwards country for centuries
Then it becomes rich and presto, now it's a poster child of Western culture
The South of Europe was the center of trade, learning and commerce
It was where Western culture originated and where it was reborn during the Renesanse
Then trade shifted away from the Med and suddenly everyone's a lazy bum
Circumstances change people and nation's. Having a similar culture means that under similar circumstances, people will act in a similar fashion
The idea that things like wealth are a product of a superior culture are little more than wishful thinking as it allows us to imagine that we could never be poor as it is in our nature to be rich and successful
Unlike every other nation or people, ours will stand the test of time, because we're just that good
In reality you could probably classify a majority of the people on the planet as being part of the "American but with a twist culture group" That's why places like Afganistan that aren't part of that overarching group seem like extreme examples
Everyone else is making pizza with local toppings and they're making some sweet rice thing that's not even pretending to be pizza
Bulgerioum
This just sums up how the most of americans does not know geography
depends if you a bitch, and want a small part of sea that wont make any difference at all
I'm sorry dude, but you don't think its worth getting worked up over it, right
Europe <3
You are wrong on all claims
Sorry mate, I see no logical causality in what you are saying
Also, US cant limit my internet no matter where sites are for 2 reasons: 1
They are not my ISP, 2
There is such thing called CDN
So how is the height scaled
Are the tallest mountains just 15 or so blocks high
In your dreams
I wish the rest of Europe was as chill as Great Britain or Portugal
Fun
Funny how no matter how much one has, them always seeks for more
You have like 200 000 lakes, yet you think about how Russia has 1 000 000
They are the world's largest country, yet dream of having warm seas
We Croats have 1 200 nice islands, yet we are annoyed that Greece has 6 000
Greeks dream of having more territories they had hundreds or thousands of years ago
Give us a list of all those who voted for this shitty bill to pass and we'll do our best to remove them from positions of power
Time for everyone to hate Europe in the coming weeks, and rightfully so
I used to think EU was actually good
Now after 5 years in the EU(i live in croatia) and seeing that EU has done nothing usefull for my country + the things i learned that they are doing,Its time to get rid off EU or reform so much that it shouldnt be even called EU anymore
>Ok, well, it's time to go back to the drawing board and come up with new protocols and systems which circumvent this bullshit
This is the answer
If we make a decentralized news agregator service, we can have it all: our snippets, and no Google
There will be a full report when the vote ends
Because you voted for the ones who lost or because you didn't vote
Wow, of course the worst statistics are in black
I see how it is
But seriously, who the fuck thought black numbers on a black background are easy to read
Why is there such a difference between czechia and slovakia
I've been reading lately about the Brabant murders and the pedophile scandals of the 90's. What the fuck Belgium ?
*in Europe
Africa, on the other hand
Probably Americans brate
Quick, how can I make this about religion
Yes, the whole affair is just surreal
Its hard to imagine someone so incompetent
*After Mélissa and Julie were kidnapped in 1995, it took police 14 months to arrest Dutroux even though he had been a prime suspect from the start and had committed similar crimes before
During the search for Mélissa and Julie, police visited Dutroux's house twice on 13 December and 19 December where Julie and Mélissa were held
However, no attempts were made to free them, even though the locksmith who accompanied the police, René Michaux, said that he heard screams of children coming from inside the house
The locksmith repeatedly said: "I'm not leaving before we turn the place upside down
The screams are clearly coming from inside the house
" To which Michaux replied: "Who is the police officer here
You or me
Not only was he not fired, the police officer was I think eventually promoted
Incredible
Also, I've heard about the possible connections of the Brabant killers with Operation Gladio, right wing government and all that
Crazy and really interesting stuff
There's a difference between Eslalit and Benelux and that's that one of the countries in the Benelux is made up
I'm not an economist
I didn't follow the debates and programs that talked about the Euro replacing the Kuna
What I do know is that everyone says that there are more benefits to the Euro
And yeah, having the same currency as most of Europe is sensibly the better choice
But as a simple pleb, I just think the Kuna is more practical
I don't know why, but every time I handled Euros it was always
weird
So, I would like to ask: If you were alive when your country switched from the local currency to the Euro, how did you accept the change
Was it weird for you
Do you miss your old currency
Edit: spelling
Why do you even use a non-bank ATM, those are the "scam" ones
Just find a normal ATM associated with a bank, or even better find an ATM associated with your bank, most European banks are owned by a bigger one
If your local bank is owned by Societe Generale, Unicredit, or whatever, the group usually has lower or even no fees when withdrawing from their ATMs no matter where they are in Europe
Is it so hard to do research in advance, especially in era of smartphones
Finding proper ATMs and checking the exchange rate takes 5 minutes tops
[At least 3 Euronet ATMs] in Slovakia, there probably other non-bank ATMs
They're only really placed in touristy areas since they're whole goal is to screw tourists over on exchange rates
I've never seen any in inland Croatia, but they're all over the coast
Only tourists use them, and almost always there's a bank ATM 10 meters away
I'm not attacking you specifically, but I am ranting because I have heard this complaint all the times, yet it's all stopped by 5 minutes of research
Also why would you even get money from an ATM abroad, usually the best option is to buy currency at home
I've only really had to use ATM abroad once in Romania, because it's hard to buy leu in Croatia, and even then I found my bank group ATM right at the airport, so no funny business, and no commission
If you're going to any country using a more popular currency like USD, CAD, JPY, CHF, etc, you can just buy it from your bank
Even if they don't have it immediately you just call them up and order it, it takes them 3 days tops to get it, you can even specify denominations you want
As I've linked in my other reply they do exist, [Euronet exists in Slovakia]
Iran is hot it does not even have color
Spain is me after waking up for the next 8 hours
I think some people usually draw Croatia similar ro Nepal with teeth trying to eat Bosnia but it is a beatiful map anyway :D. Also maps without Iceland but we don't have to talk about that
So cool, nice work
Everyone knows Iceland doesn't exist
why does it look like dinarids mountain chain are the highest mountains, and Alps are barely noticable against all the other scattered mountains
Ah yes, if it's Russian, it must have a star
It's not evil, it's a matter of opinion
perkele
.. am i doing it right
"Welcome to Hell"
Oof
Oh wow am in third place NICE
Not even surprised
Yay 3rd worst
Way to go
Well how you're supposed to pay bills on time when they don't even arrive on time
Also, probably online banking has huge role in this, for example in my family 90% pays bills manually, only few of them does it via some app or something
And paying manually is pain in the ass, you have to go to post, bank or somewhere, and also people are lazy to do that haha
I always find Greece, Bulgaria and us being on top of maps for all the wrong reasons
Nah
It's really bad
I don't know about Slovenia but here people are massively emigrating to western countries
Even pensioners can't raise it but how much the pension is low
Backwards
imagine having the balls to take candid photos of a probably very pissed stalin

In croatia we too have problems with our state universities
Most of our academics are morally bankrupt and the rector of the Zagreb University, the most important one, Boras is an insult to the entire education system
He lacks basic manners
In a ceremony where the best army cadets received awards, he approached a female cadet and told her to take off her facemask so "that everyone could see her beautiful face" and added that she is "not only smart, but beautiful too" on live tv
However, the worst thing is that he is a religious fanatic and is poisoning every college (Faculty) 1 by 1 by installing his people there

Fun fact:
There are still 11 UN member states which haven't formally recognised Croatia or established diplomatic relations with Croatia
*Bhutan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Eswatini (Swaziland), Liberia, Marshal Islands, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan, Tonga and Tuvalu
It should be the same for all EU countries
Jebeni Niger :D
I mean it was way worse ~10 years ago
so I'll take this
Tbf most of these countries have long-lasting and ongoing internal problems and the least of their worries is the diplomatic relation with a new far-away politically insignificant European country
It seems that my source is a bit outdated
Thank you for the info
I believe that I expressed myself a bit wrong
Croatia is politically insignificant for those countries mentioned above, since we don't have any diplomatic relation, economic import/export deal or business, history or any contact whatsoever with each other
It's officially recognized as [Croatian national dish] as well
Please, leave your nationalistic views aside
This is not the moment, the topic nor the place for that
It is only Bosnian national dish, but it has spread to Serbia and Croatia, as well as to the other countries
Same goes for burek
Never said they originate from Croatia
And "famous" does not mean "original". So, omce again
this is Bosnian national dish
It has spread to other countries
But
like always, Serbs will calim whatever they get their hands on
From burek and cevapi, to sarma and rakija
To them it has all originated there
Doesn't even matter that even Romania has sarma for an example

In Croatia, the priests are employed in hospitals on a good salary, and it was all introduced by Social-Democrats
We don't even need clerical fascists, we have social democrats for that purpose
Of course, the Constitution is shitting about the secular state, but who cares
He is wearing a cassock
That's a yearly tradition in Croatia as well
Priests come, bless your house, take whatever money you've placed on the table and leave until next year round
Few years back the priest was coming early on 1

This is opposite of tragic
We have more than we need
We have a lot of people dumpster diving
What do you thing they are looking for
It is impossible to precisely calculate exactly how much food is necessary and those who tried a top down system like that starved millions
It is better to overproduce and waste some than leave people hungry
Complaining about waste amd calling it tragic is really out of touch with the reality of human condition throughout our history
You always have to ask "compared to what
" when making these assesments
And when you ask that, you will see that this isnt tragic but spectacular comapred to any alternative
Maybe you can dream up a scenario where it is better but making it's easy to fantasize and hard to make things work perfectly
In developed countries, they are looking for things to sell for the most part
Plastic bottles, metals
And it's not "a lot" by a long shot

Why
Because there is a civil debate about a political subject
A) you don't elect bureaucrats anywhere
B) the same people appointing the ones in the Netherlands have a vote in appointing the ones in Brussels
C) I'm all for giving the European Parliament more power so that the EU is more directly Democratic, but the democratically elected representatives of the people in member countries don't like the competition

BiH is a lot more complicated, through the Dayton agreement it was made as a federation of three peoples(Croats, Bosnians and Serbs)/ two states(Republika Srbska and Federaton of Bosnia and Hercegovina)
There are ethnic tension that last from the fall of Yugoslavia, some want to seceed (dk how to spell that word), a lot of corruption (newest case i remember hearing is when a patient with corona was released because he's something to a person with a high position, either in hospital or state, can't remember)
This is just sad
They didn't even do that bad something of these are ok
Not saying that these are all socialist countries hut but a lot of them have socialist elements
Left wing ones are the worst
Right wing ones seem very sane
Yap, but the same boss
To appease the socialists, by giving their members what they actually wanted
To quell the liberals and the intellectuals by separating them from the workers, because old Otto figured out that the average worker only really wanted a decent wage and some level of security and safety
Given that Prussia and the early German Reich was a Paternal monarchy, it wasn't even that hard to convince the Keiser that providing this was not only politically prudent but also his duty as the father of all Germans

Spotify is European
That's hilarious and sad at the same time, they don't even let me use their site although I'm on the same fucking continent as them
Maybe Spotify is ''European'' but it's very much oriented on the USA, considering they refuse to provide service for over half of their own continent
It's probably the same in Croatia
How big is the sample though
I have idea, why doesn't Poland and Romania replace its government with European commission so that we see how far will that experiment go
Can’t believe we almost let them into the EU
They aren’t sanctioning France, they are calling for boycotts on French products
Some Qatari supermarket chains joined the boycotts as well and they won’t sell French products any more
So if you want something reciprocal you should aim for boycotts, not sanctions
Unless you of course think that calls for boycotts validate sanctions

It's like those trolls you get on your team in League, and I suppose in other games, ~~in your promos~~ occasionally
They decide a game is lost at some point, could be before it even began, and if you are winning, they just decide to assist the enemy team and type about how they were right about the game being a lost cause
All while still putting all the blame on whatever they first perceived as the reason the game will be lost
Yeah, no shit we can't win 4v6 when your retarded ass is trying to ruin us
Except this is real life

Wow, didn't know München was so high

Looks a bit different now
Nice :)
Nice brother :D
it looked different then
I dont think it was without scaffolding since independence
Ackchyually it's neo-Gothic
The two towers' tops are gone and one tower is under scaffolidng
We don't have Polish amount of churches
True
For about forever
I’m 25 years old and have never in my life seen it without it
The renovations should have been completed this year I believe, but now after the quake, they say we’re looking at a long time before it’s renovated
Probably 20+ more years
The scaffolding is so iconic now, I think it would actually be weird to see it without it
Because the right side was built with different kind of stone and is always falling apart, and instead of taking the whole tower down and start anew, the church likes to leech off the money needed for 'renovation' for 50 years now
They say renovations will be completed this year for every year now
Towers are built from very porous stone that gets dissolved in water and they get destroyed pretty quickly
If my memory serves me correctly they just keep changing which tower they work on
This guy is right
We usually do in fact blame Serbia for pretty much everything, but as far as I know they had nothing to do with the earthquake :)
I'm not an expert but I think the time period it was built in
Gothic architecture is from the middle ages and this was built at the end of the 19th century
It's also called gothic revival architecture:

France beats Croatia once again :(
More people in the UK have a negative opinion about the UK than about Croatia
Despite them being better than us in football, I'd say I like France
They have decent music (especially the 80's), nice language (although their words are almost impossible to pronounce properly as their words can have 20 letters but they only pronounce like 12), and I believe they have pretty positive opinion about us as well
It is just that they are better than we are in football
Strange, one would think that after two very important and massive losses in 2008 and 2018 the average British person would know the Croatia NT very well
I guess the Irish, Welsh and Scottish were also surveyed, but I assume most were English
And yeah, the English are well known as among, if not the worst tourists in Croatia
It is regularly taught in schools, but doesn't have too much significance in everyday life as it only lasted 7 years and didn't encompass whole of Croatia
It's more of a fun fact
Considering it's late October and a pandemic, nah
The issue are mostly young people who come over in big groups thinking Croatia is a cheap party destination and then proceed to stay wasted for 90% of their stay, making a big mess of everything
They usually flock to places like Zrće so they're not that hard to avoid
We have millions of tourists every year, so you only hear about the bad stuff
I have little personal experience with British tourists since the town I live in is smaller (\~35k)
The only British tourists I ever encountered were these 2 old ladies who turned out to be the cheapest people I've ever met (paying the **exact** amount for their meal, not leaving a single lipa as tip)
Personally I dislike Italians much more than the Brits, I'm just telling you what the public opinion is like throughout the country
Cheap and stuck up
They also sometimes like letting a bit of fascism slip through (hanging italian flags in "Italian" towns, etc
you know denmark, this means war
We have been in the EU for years now
Croatia is EU member and I don't see data about it
But they are not in the EU sadly

If the poll asked “other than English” the number would be far lower for everyone
I can write in Bosnian
Does that count ?
Finally Croatia in the top 10 for something useful :)
And yes, we are thought either German, English or Italian (depending on the region) from first grade all the way to high school until graduation
&#x200B;
There are numerous reasons why we speak a second language
TV, music, gaming, school, family members who (have) work(ed) somewhere abroad
I don't know anyone below 40 who doesn't speak English or German to some degree and I get to meet a lot of people
Croatian and bosnian
I was expecting the Hungarian one to be lower, speaking from experience with Hungarian tourists, I've not met a single one IRL that could understand and speak English or any other language, it often made dealing with Hungarian tourists problematic for all of us living and working in the tourist heavy zones such as the coast line and islands since almost no one knows Hungarian
Idk why is it but my eyes teared up looking at this
It could be an eyegarsm

858 euros in Croatia, kinda doubt that somewhat
The overall average iv'e seen regular folk earning is usually at around 500-600 euros a month back home, with the next tier being at 600-750
If you're someone back home with a job that hits 1k Euros a month or very close to that, you're pretty much a rich person in the eyes of many country folk
This is cool :)
Can we see "Net Average Monthly living costs in Europe (€)"
Portugal once again reaffirming their position as a rightful member of Central Europe
Data for Croatia is flawed: most of the people here receive minimum or slightly above minimum wage, which is then offset by the 2% who have absolutely ridiculous income
So the average is 800 something euros, but the average Joe receives maybe 450 or so
Rich my ass, I get around 1700 euros post-tax and I can't afford to buy real estate without taking a 20 year loan
I'm feeling so rich
All this map tells me is that no person in Europe who works for a salary will ever be anything close to rich
We live fine, let's not kid ourselves, IMO I don't have a lot to complain about day-to-day, but we will never be rich, at least not in time to enjoy it for long
I recently looked at some stats and it turns out I'm in the top 1% of income in the country, yet the only thing I own is my 10 year old car(which I like, to be honest), and to get a nice apartment I'd have to get a huge loan at extortionate interest like 3
5% if I'm lucky
Cue fear of losing my job and economic enslavement as soon as I'd sign the papers, yay
(I realize that to some this might sound like I'm a huge douchebag, which is possible
I'm just trying to say how sad I am that it turns out that in fact no country on Earth is actually "rich" when you look at the normal folk who work for a salary)

Austria (Habsburg Monarchy, and Austria-Hungary later on)
Hungary
Ottoman Empire
Venice (only relevant to the coast)
Yugoslavia as a whole I guess, or rather Serbia
Honorable mention is France in the Napoleonic era
Yeah, actually
Hungary was more prominent during the late medieval era, with all the Hungarian, German and French kings and dynasties and stuff, but Austria actually had more prominence after the Habsburg monarchy (16th century), around the time the Ottomans turned up (not to mention that we generally always kind of favored Austria over Hungary)
Slovenia: you were really successful in the last 25 years and we should look up to you
Also you have an incredibly beautiful country
Hungary: you're kinda mysterious to us, but you've actually contributed to our culture and economy throughout history (same with Austria, Italy and France, even Czech Republic/Bohemia to an extent)
Serbia: you have pretty awesome food, and really nice architecture in the north
Kind of exotic but familiar at the same time
Bosnia: amazing nature
Montenegro: uhh
you guys exist
But yeah, great nature and landscape too, probably chill people
I do, but try to avoid it because it's disgusting how calorie-dense it is
but fuck I love milk lol
I've been told I look Dutch (even though I'm pretty short)
Best you can do is tell if someone is more southern or northern European looking, but even then, there's a bunch of Italians with light hair and eyes, and I've seen Scottish and Irish people who look stereotypically Spanish (think Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery and Colin Farrell)
To add, it's also the classic "northern" Europe vs "southern" Europe rivalry, with Zagreb being colder, and people being stereotyped as quieter and stuck up, and Split being warmer, and people being more wild and passionate, but lazy at the same time
When they use the word whom, or the word fewer instead of less when referring to countable nouns (as in "there are fewer people in the room", instead of "there are less people in the room)
A side note, many English speakers will say "**there's** less people in the room", at least Americans will
These things are taught as being correct, but very few native English speakers actually talk like that
Honestly I never thought of English as a hard language
I've never actually had to sit down and study it like I have to with Spanish
That's not to say that Spanish is harder, it's a pretty easy language actually
The only reason my Spanish sucks is that I have zero interest in learning it, and absolutely nothing I watch is in Spanish
It's the opposite with English, pretty much everything I watch/read/listen is in English
If for whatever reason I became interested in Spanish I could learn to speak fluently just like that, no problem
Since I already learned so much of the grammar and vocabulary, all I'd need is to just rehearse all if it
The reason I never remember all the verb endings and vocab is because I never cared about learning them, I just want a decent grade on my exams
The notorious [Museum of Broken Relationships] in Zagreb
Everyone always talks how much they loved it and how cool and *quirky* it is
It's the most gimmicky thing ever, and I doubt anyone who lives in Zagreb cares about it, or that anyone has ever really been there
The [Technical Museum] is better by an order of magnitude, there's a ton of old vehicles (trams, cars, planes) and models of even more things like boats, various tools and machines, a planetarium, a fucking *mine*, that you can walk through
Egypt and Mesopotamia, for like two weeks each, Indus Valley, China and Mesoamerica each for about an hour, and then the rest of the 1st year is spent on the Greeks (Persians too, briefly), and Romans, plus a little bit about Carthage, the Celts, Germanics etc
Overall, probably Bandić, the mayor of Zagreb
Even though he's mostly irrelevant outside of the city, he is **really** hated here
He's basically the epitome of corruption and money laundering
Because of him there've been a ton of useless projects conducted (mostly the obscene amount of bollards and fountains, as well as some more ridiculous stuff) across the city
Another thing most people don't like about him is that he's a Croat from southern Bosnia, and those people are basically viewed the same way Sicilians are viewed in northern Italy, if not worse
Of course discrimination is bad, but it's hard to ignore the fact that most of them are extremely conservative and religious, plus their mentality, which is completely different from northern Croatia
Besides him, a lot of conservatives don't like the new president Milanović, mostly because of his liberal stances on social issues I think, but I'm not that informed on him (or really Croatian politics in general if I'm honest)
Nooo it's not his first term
He's been in office for almost 20 years
Who votes for him
well the same people who vote for Orbán, or Janša. I'm glad to say I don't have those types in my family or among friends
Well first of all the political and especially social situation in Croatia is extremely complex
I simply can't explain that in even a few paragraphs
Basically most people are apathetic and won't bother doing anything about a politician they don't like
And I do believe most people don't like him, but those who don't tend to be the most apathetic voters
It's sad, but I think he will finally get voted out in the next election
Which city would that be
Asking for
uh, friend
Me too (I love that city so much), just wanna be sure
This just gave me an idea of an action-adventure game about an immortal European who fights with the Romans, the Franks, the Vikings, in the 30 Years war, WWI and WWII etc
I'd play the heck out of that lol
Okay I really wanna know how French people pronounce Panzerkampfwagen lmao
Split because it's Florida
As for the region, inland Dalmatia, because it's stuck in the middle ages
**Zagreb** (800 000), **Split** (200 000), **Rijeka** (150 000)
**Zagreb** - Obviously it's by far the biggest city, mainly because half of Croatia moved here in the last century
Fun fact, Zagreb has a larger GDP than the entire country of Bosnia and Herzegovina (3
3 million) ($27 billion in 2017 vs  $21 billion in 2020), so I find that kind of funny
As you can guess, Zagreb has all the same stereotypes as other disproportionately larger cities get (think London and Paris), coupled with specifically northern Croatian stereotypes (cold, introverted, stingy, arrogant etc), even though well over half of Zagreb isn't even originally from northern Croatia
**Split** - Zagreb's rival
It's a lot like what Marseilles is to Paris, or Naples to Milan, the "Mediterranean counterpart". You can guess all the stereotypes just from that
**Rijeka** - also on the coast, but culturally and historically is a lot more closely tied with Zagreb
People are similar, they speak similar (a lot of people in Rijeka have adopted parts of Zagreb slang as well northern dialectal words and the pronunciation, to some extent, this would be unimaginable in Split)
There isn't really a rivalry, most people feel neutral to positive about the other city
The honorable mention -  **Osijek** (100 000), the only real city in eastern Croatia
Used to be a lot more significant in the past, but now is not doing so well, much like the rest of the region
Interestingly the 4 main cities correspond to the cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and main cultural regions

To add, it's also the classic "northern" Europe vs "southern" Europe rivalry, with Zagreb being colder, and people being stereotyped as quieter and stuck up, and Split being warmer, and people being more wild and passionate, but lazy at the same time
When they use the word whom, or the word fewer instead of less when referring to countable nouns (as in "there are fewer people in the room", instead of "there are less people in the room)
A side note, many English speakers will say "**there's** less people in the room", at least Americans will
These things are taught as being correct, but very few native English speakers actually talk like that
Honestly I never thought of English as a hard language
I've never actually had to sit down and study it like I have to with Spanish
That's not to say that Spanish is harder, it's a pretty easy language actually
The only reason my Spanish sucks is that I have zero interest in learning it, and absolutely nothing I watch is in Spanish
It's the opposite with English, pretty much everything I watch/read/listen is in English
If for whatever reason I became interested in Spanish I could learn to speak fluently just like that, no problem
Since I already learned so much of the grammar and vocabulary, all I'd need is to just rehearse all if it
The reason I never remember all the verb endings and vocab is because I never cared about learning them, I just want a decent grade on my exams
The notorious [Museum of Broken Relationships] in Zagreb
Everyone always talks how much they loved it and how cool and *quirky* it is
It's the most gimmicky thing ever, and I doubt anyone who lives in Zagreb cares about it, or that anyone has ever really been there
The [Technical Museum] is better by an order of magnitude, there's a ton of old vehicles (trams, cars, planes) and models of even more things like boats, various tools and machines, a planetarium, a fucking *mine*, that you can walk through
Egypt and Mesopotamia, for like two weeks each, Indus Valley, China and Mesoamerica each for about an hour, and then the rest of the 1st year is spent on the Greeks (Persians too, briefly), and Romans, plus a little bit about Carthage, the Celts, Germanics etc
Overall, probably Bandić, the mayor of Zagreb
Even though he's mostly irrelevant outside of the city, he is **really** hated here
He's basically the epitome of corruption and money laundering
Because of him there've been a ton of useless projects conducted (mostly the obscene amount of bollards and fountains, as well as some more ridiculous stuff) across the city
Another thing most people don't like about him is that he's a Croat from southern Bosnia, and those people are basically viewed the same way Sicilians are viewed in northern Italy, if not worse
Of course discrimination is bad, but it's hard to ignore the fact that most of them are extremely conservative and religious, plus their mentality, which is completely different from northern Croatia
Besides him, a lot of conservatives don't like the new president Milanović, mostly because of his liberal stances on social issues I think, but I'm not that informed on him (or really Croatian politics in general if I'm honest)
Nooo it's not his first term
He's been in office for almost 20 years
Who votes for him
well the same people who vote for Orbán, or Janša. I'm glad to say I don't have those types in my family or among friends
Well first of all the political and especially social situation in Croatia is extremely complex
I simply can't explain that in even a few paragraphs
Basically most people are apathetic and won't bother doing anything about a politician they don't like
And I do believe most people don't like him, but those who don't tend to be the most apathetic voters
It's sad, but I think he will finally get voted out in the next election
Which city would that be
Asking for
uh, friend
Me too (I love that city so much), just wanna be sure
This just gave me an idea of an action-adventure game about an immortal European who fights with the Romans, the Franks, the Vikings, in the 30 Years war, WWI and WWII etc
I'd play the heck out of that lol
Okay I really wanna know how French people pronounce Panzerkampfwagen lmao
Split because it's Florida
As for the region, inland Dalmatia, because it's stuck in the middle ages
**Zagreb** (800 000), **Split** (200 000), **Rijeka** (150 000)
**Zagreb** - Obviously it's by far the biggest city, mainly because half of Croatia moved here in the last century
Fun fact, Zagreb has a larger GDP than the entire country of Bosnia and Herzegovina (3
3 million) ($27 billion in 2017 vs  $21 billion in 2020), so I find that kind of funny
As you can guess, Zagreb has all the same stereotypes as other disproportionately larger cities get (think London and Paris), coupled with specifically northern Croatian stereotypes (cold, introverted, stingy, arrogant etc), even though well over half of Zagreb isn't even originally from northern Croatia
**Split** - Zagreb's rival
It's a lot like what Marseilles is to Paris, or Naples to Milan, the "Mediterranean counterpart". You can guess all the stereotypes just from that
**Rijeka** - also on the coast, but culturally and historically is a lot more closely tied with Zagreb
People are similar, they speak similar (a lot of people in Rijeka have adopted parts of Zagreb slang as well northern dialectal words and the pronunciation, to some extent, this would be unimaginable in Split)
There isn't really a rivalry, most people feel neutral to positive about the other city
The honorable mention -  **Osijek** (100 000), the only real city in eastern Croatia
Used to be a lot more significant in the past, but now is not doing so well, much like the rest of the region
Interestingly the 4 main cities correspond to the cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and main cultural regions
Is the femboy rod up
It can't be *that* easy

Man the video on the toplap should've been the one where the guy says "If my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike"
Being from northern Croatia, I feel the same as Slovenia
If the HRE border was drawn a little bit more to the east, we would just be Styrians
Awww Slovenia ️
